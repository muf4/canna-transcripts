i do want to apologize that sometimes

49
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,840
i've noticed the episodes are not

50
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:00,719
loading on spotify uh stitcher radio

51
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,960
apple podcasts in a timely appropriate

52
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:05,359
manner i do schedule those episodes to

53
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:07,280
pop up it is what is it midnight when it

54
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:09,118
shifts from sunday night to monday

55
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,318
morning i guess that's midnight monday

56
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:11,919
i'm not sure if that's midnight sun

57
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:14,000
anyway you know what i'm talking about

58
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:15,519
the shift in mountain time from sunday

59
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,520
to monday at 12 o'clock that's when the

60
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,760
show should post also wednesday to

61
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,840
thursday that transition it should post

62
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:23,439
however some of the servers are late

63
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,039
some of them are behind i don't

64
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:27,039
completely understand the technology

65
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:30,400
that makes it happen but i know that i

66
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:32,400
post my file my show to an rss feed

67
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,239
every so often those servers do what is

68
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,400
known as a crawl they make sure that

69
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,599
they've got all the rss feeds caught up

70
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,879
they go through and they do an update

71
00:02:37,598 --> 00:02:40,159
it's like do i have any messages is

72
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:41,679
basically what they do they scroll

73
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:43,439
through and they say hey ross jeff

74
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,120
posted some new [ __ ] we'll put that out

75
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:47,039
to the feed they post it up to their

76
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,280
stuff then you guys were able to access

77
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:51,039
it sometimes it happens instantly

78
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,039
sometimes it takes hours for it to

79
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:55,359
happen there are servers that i can't

80
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:56,959
even get to update at this point in time

81
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,280
a lot of people tell me that my show is

82
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,878
not working on google podcasts i've

83
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,800
emailed them i've updated the server

84
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:04,399
i've done everything i know how to do

85
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,560
that [ __ ] isn't gonna work i don't know

86
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,000
what to do next the customer service is

87
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,000
basically tired of me they've quit

88
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,680
responding i might be stuck one day i

89
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
may get inspired to start over there but

90
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,159
so far google podcast has been [ __ ] out

91
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,080
of luck i noticed that recently stitcher

92
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:19,840
radio has stopped updating my show

93
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,200
completely i've messaged customer

94
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,598
service there they have not given me a

95
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:25,359
resolution my point here is i do know

96
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:27,598
now that the episodes that the shows are

97
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:31,200
messing up on some servers however i did

98
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:33,759
not know until a few polite listeners

99
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:35,359
messaged me if i'm missing shows

100
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:37,518
if the episodes are not popping up where

101
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,920
they should be when they should be maybe

102
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,840
i don't know i don't watch my show on

103
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:43,759
every platform as often as i should i

104
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,519
don't check as much as i should maybe i

105
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:47,199
rely on the audience to let me know when

106
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,599
things go wrong and a lot of times you

107
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:51,119
do sometimes you do not so i do

108
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:52,318
encourage you you may you might not even

109
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,000
hear this because you're waiting for an

110
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:55,598
episode to update someone you don't even

111
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,680
know that this is coming out with this

112
00:03:55,598 --> 00:03:59,039
could be completely redundant however if

113
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,200
i do miss an episode you're wondering

114
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:03,039

172
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,079
we're gonna move forward in this episode

173
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,680
we're gonna cover a couple of emails and

174
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:03,758
i've got a few great messages right here

175
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,000
on the table let's jump right into it

176
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,600
the first one here came from my buddy

177
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,360
alabama man what's up you bad

178
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,600
[ __ ] hope you're doing well this

179
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,479
message goes a lot like this it says

180
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,720
rasta jeff here's one for the show

181
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:19,038
what is a private grower to do when all

182
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,440
of the testing labs on google require

183
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:23,680
strict adherence to state laws grower

184
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:26,959
ids and such are there any labs you're

185
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:29,280
aware of that accept private samples for

186
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:31,758
testing unfortunately in the state of

187
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:33,839
colorado right now we are not allowed to

188
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:36,319
have our personal private grows tested

189
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:38,399
to the best of my knowledge all of the

190
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,479
testing facilities have to be regulated

191
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:41,599
by the colorado marijuana enforcement

192
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:43,359
division

193
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,879
there is a reason for that a lot of

194
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,520
people don't like the rules and reasons

195
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:49,759
and regulations but let me explain why

196
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:52,159
this rule is in place

197
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:54,240
for a facility to possess the amount of

198
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,560
cannabis which may be delivered to a

199
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,680
testing facility at any one given time

200
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,598
they would go over their legal limits in

201
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,598
the state of colorado without some sort

202
00:07:01,598 --> 00:07:06,159
of special licensing without some sort

203
00:07:03,598 --> 00:07:08,240
of possession limit so if we all just

204
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,160
took it maybe take one gram maybe two

205
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,240
grams of your batch if we all took two

206
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,319
grams or a gram to this testing lab

207
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,560
they're going to have at least ounces

208
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:19,199
probably pounds maybe multiple pounds of

209
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,959
product on site at one time which does

210
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,199
make them over the limit for their

211
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:24,399
regular possession of cannabis in

212
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,199
colorado we're allowed to have two

213
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:29,120
ounces in our possession 28 grams times

214
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,560
two is 56 grams that's going to put them

215
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,800
over their limit really quickly if they

216
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,240
get good clientele good customers they

217
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,079
can't have anything in storage they

218
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,759
can't have a backlog so you can't bring

219
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:40,719
it in give it to them they can't test it

220
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:42,160
also there's no legal transfer

221
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,479
opportunity there they have to have a

222
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,400
way to receive the product from

223
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:47,758
the person giving it to them then they

224
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:50,638
have to receive it away it's got to be

225
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:53,038
documented so to avoid any sort of weird

226
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:55,280
legal complications illegal transfer

227
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:56,878
illegal possession they did decide to

228
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:59,038
regulate those facilities by the

229
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,800
marijuana enforcement division which

230
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:02,719
means only facilities which are

231
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,560
regulated by the marijuana enforcement

232
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,800
division are allowed to use those

233
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,399
facilities so the commercial groves are

234
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,800
the only ones that can use those here in

235
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:12,318
the state of colorado to the best of my

236
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,639
knowledge there may be little private

237
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,400
pop-up shops that are doing it uh there

238
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,720
are not advertising heavily i don't know

239
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:20,799
where they are wink wink but they may be

240
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,280
secretly available that is the state of

241
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,079
colorado in newer states i'm not exactly

242
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:24,959
sure

243
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:27,598
um

244
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:29,279
the way the testing is working there one

245
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:31,279
thing i do have two recommendations that

246
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:33,838
i can recommend for you

247
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:35,918
one is they are now offering at-home

248
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,680
testing devices i do not work for any of

249
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:39,439
those companies there's one company

250
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:41,199
that's named after a color

251
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,159
if you would like to send me a sample of

252
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,480
your

253
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:46,480
sample of your thc testing device i

254
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,560
would love to play with that i would do

255
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,560
a solid review on the show if you want

256
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:52,559
me to buy it for a half price or a

257
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:53,599
advertising price let's reach out and

258
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:54,399
talk to each other it's a little

259
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,320
expensive

260
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,759
for a toy that i wouldn't use very much

261
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,040
but if they sent it to me i would

262
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:00,958
definitely talk about it on the show

263
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:03,199
advertise the [ __ ] out of it it is named

264
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:06,159
after a color and it is a testing device

265
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:08,480
that will test your thc content at home

266
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:10,879
i have a couple of friends who say it is

267
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,560
a very reliable device now here's what

268
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:15,439
you can do with it i wouldn't rely on it

269
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:16,799
to be uh as reliable as a lab and i'm

270
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,800
going to talk more let's talk about that

271
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:20,958
right now the labs aren't 100 reliable

272
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:23,759
in my opinion anyway i know how to skew

273
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:25,278
a lab test i've sent uh one sample two

274
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:27,120
samples to a lab and have had two

275
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:28,958
totally different tests i've had the

276
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,720
same sample sent to two labs and had

277
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:32,479
totally different tests the lab testing

278
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,278
is not a hundred percent accurate at

279
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,959
this time yet anyway so the at-home lab

280
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:38,559
testing may be just as good you could

281
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:40,000
pay one price for this device i do

282
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:41,919
believe it's about fifteen hundred

283
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,600
dollars but once you've got it you can

284
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:46,319
test all your products the testing gets

285
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,000
expensive if you test a lot anyway uh so

286
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,080
you can get this one tester at home and

287
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,919
test with that it may not be a hundred

288
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,080
percent accurate is where i was headed

289
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:56,079
but it will give you a range if you were

290
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,080
a breeder and you were pheno hunting or

291
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,519
if you're a grower that is pheno hunting

292
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,680
you're trying to find that phenotype

293
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,919
that produces the most thc you'll still

294
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:06,239
know which one produced the most one

295
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:09,199
will say 17 one will say 18 one will say

296
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:11,759
19. if that machine isn't 100 accurate

297
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,759
we still know which one is low medium

298
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:15,838
and highest that will be a good place to

299
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:17,759
start and then test a bunch of products

300
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:20,000
with that then send those same products

301
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:22,480
to labs and see how close that testing

302
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,200
comes back compare them once again if

303
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,920
you run a thc testing company that makes

304
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,240
a

305
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:29,679
an at-home product let's talk because i

306
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,200
would love to have one of those on the

307
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:33,199
show i'd love to play with that i'm

308
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,360
talking to you if your company is the

309
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,278
name of a color all right so the at-home

310
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,560
testing in colorado the first thing i

311
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:40,078
would recommend is get yourself an

312
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:42,000
at-home testing device the one named

313
00:10:40,078 --> 00:10:43,359
after a color is the one i recommend

314
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,559
nobody pays me to say that i've got

315
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,399
friends that have used it they say it's

316
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:48,319
a great product the next way that you

317
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,799
could do this in colorado

318
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,399
um allegedly i've heard of people doing

319
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:54,000
this i can't tell you to do this i can't

320
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,000
recommend that you do this i may get in

321
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,399
trouble for that so i'm going to say

322
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:02,000
what i know people to have done in the

323
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:03,600
past is to find a cbd testing laboratory

324
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,240
in the state of colorado if you want to

325
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,839
grow hemp or cbd plants those plants

326
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,159
cannot test within a threshold of

327
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:12,480
cannabis over 0.3 percent so they can't

328
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:14,319
sit 0.3 or 3 percent doesn't matter

329
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,079
there's a low number of thc those plants

330
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,760
can have in them and if they have higher

331
00:11:16,078 --> 00:11:19,759
than that they're not allowed to be sold

332
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:22,078
as hemp plants they're no longer cbd

333
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:23,838
they're thc plants your crop is what we

334
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:25,759
call hot it's got to be destroyed or

335
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,440
it's got to be mitigated in some way

336
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:30,000
it's where that thc doesn't make it to

337
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,839
your clients so a lot of those brands a

338
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
lot of those farms are required to test

339
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,440
their product they have a testing lab

340
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,039
set up where a lot of people take their

341
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,800
hemp and get it tested

342
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:40,879
maybe possibly i've heard of people

343
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:42,799
taking their home-grown cannabis there

344
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:45,600
that they knew was gonna be super high

345
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:47,439
testing in thc and zero cbd and you just

346
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,959
turn it in and you say here's my hemp

347
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,399
sample can you give me a report and they

348
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,679
call you back and they go they don't

349
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,519
really say this but they kind of say

350
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:55,838
this they go you [ __ ] you knew

351
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:58,799
this was gonna be 32 percent thc and

352
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:00,000
zero cbd this is not qualifying as cbd

353
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:01,599
as hemp what are you gonna do and they

354
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,879
go oh thank you for the lab report thank

355
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,360
you a lot and they pay it and they have

356
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:07,679
a [ __ ] thc report that says 32

357
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,440
that is a shady shifty way to do it but

358
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:11,599
it's all too common here in colorado

359
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,519
because that is what we've got to do if

360
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,759
a home grower does want to get their

361
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:19,039
product tested in a reliable safe

362
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:21,360
effective way and not buy a home testing

363
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:23,039
device all right i think i wrapped that

364
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,639
one up um

365
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:26,719
with all the strict adherence to laws

366
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,560
yeah um you're gonna have to either find

367
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,800
a lab testing place that will test a

368
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:33,119
homegrower stuff buy yourself a home

369
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:35,120
testing device or be shady and send it

370
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,959
through a hemp testing facility another

371
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,679
way you could do it if you have some

372
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:42,000
friends that run a commercial grow maybe

373
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:43,519
you can sneak your sample in with their

374
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,839
sample batch and they'll let you get

375
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,440
away with that but that's illegal i

376
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,720
can't recommend that i couldn't tell you

377
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,360
that you do that but i've heard of

378
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,120
people allegedly possibly doing that

379
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,560
keep in mind rosta jeff is a fictional

380
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,399
character anything we say here is all

381
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:58,239
for entertainment purposes let's move

382
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:01,440
forward i do have another email here in

383
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:03,200
front of me this one says a little bit

384
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,279
like this it says yo ross to jeff i hope

385
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,600
all is well i have a grow question for

386
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:11,120
you buddy that is my department of

387
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:13,120
expertise it says if i reversed a female

388
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,440
uh it has hella pollen sacs but no

389
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:19,200
pollen could it be from too strong of an

390
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:21,440
sts solution yes it absolutely could it

391
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,120
could be from too strong it could be too

392
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,040
weak it could be not enough sprays it

393
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,278
could be too many sprays there are so

394
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:29,439
many variables that can contribute to

395
00:13:27,278 --> 00:13:32,480
the sts not working that's why when i do

396
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:34,720
an sts spray i always recommend spraying

397
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,720
multiple clones of the same cultivar

398
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,920
that you want to produce pollen of that

399
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,320
way you've got

400
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:41,919
different uh applications will produce

401
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,959
different results i'll hit one plant

402
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:46,559
with 90 one with 80 one with 70. if i've

403
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:48,799
got more plants i'll spray one more

404
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:50,239
often i'll spray one less i'll just do

405
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:51,838
different [ __ ] that way i know that

406
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,560
something is going to work and i write

407
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:56,079
down what i did to plant a b and c and i

408
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:57,439
write down what worked and i remember

409
00:13:56,078 --> 00:14:01,039
that for the next time i grow that

410
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:02,320
cultivar and i do intend to reverse it

411
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:04,078
let me read more of the message here

412
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,480
just to make sure i don't skip anything

413
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:09,198
it says i started with a 50 mil part a

414
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,360
and b to 400 distilled water spring five

415
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:14,159
days sprayed every three days oh i see

416
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,480
the problem you only put let's see 50

417
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:19,039
mils parts a and b that may work if you

418
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,879
used the right dilutions of the right

419
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:22,958
amounts of products a and b your half a

420
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:24,480
gram and two and a half grams you mix

421
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:26,239
them in the distilled water started

422
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,839
spraying five days before flipping spray

423
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,519
it every three days

424
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,639
the last spray was on day 20. what do

425
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,720
you recommend

426
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,480
um

427
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,079
i also want to try to reverse this exact

428
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,920
same strain so i don't want to just move

429
00:14:36,078 --> 00:14:40,399
on until i'm sure she won't reverse oh

430
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:42,719
this is just the first try when it comes

431
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,879
to reversing plants do not ever expect

432
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,480
that first attempt to be completely

433
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:48,320
successful that is

434
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,959
sometimes that works but some plants are

435
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:53,199
very picky it doesn't say what plant you

436
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:54,239
are using some plants are very picky

437
00:14:53,198 --> 00:14:56,479
some plants

438
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:59,680
will reverse very easily what i would

439
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:01,839
recommend uh is mix up a fresh batch of

440
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:04,638
the silver thiosulfate a brand new fresh

441
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:08,639
batch cut three clones of the same plant

442
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:10,879
spray one at 90 180 one at 70 dilution

443
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:13,360
and see what happens then spray

444
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:15,600
seven days before flip then flip then

445
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,199
spray day one then you understand the

446
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,879
pattern spray on the day one when you

447
00:15:17,198 --> 00:15:22,319
flip and then spray up to about day 24

448
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:24,240
and then let's see what happens maybe

449
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,920
one of those will spit out the pollen

450
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,440
for you if not i do have other

451
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:28,719
recommendations we may have to spend a

452
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,800
little bit more money we may have to

453
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:33,120
step up our game but we do have other

454
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:34,958
options let's try different dilutions

455
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,198
and see if a little stronger dilution or

456
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:39,518
a little lighter dilution will work

457
00:15:37,198 --> 00:15:42,159
possibly if you can do more plants let's

458
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:43,679
spray one of them ah more frequently and

459
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:46,078
one of them less frequently let's

460
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:48,319
experiment a little you've only got one

461
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:50,719
sample so this isn't scientific this is

462
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:53,120
all uh so many variables so many

463
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,959
anomalies because it is only one testing

464
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,560
sample let's do the test again let's

465
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:58,799
control it let's take a lot of notes and

466
00:15:56,559 --> 00:16:00,319
see what we get from don't give up you

467
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:02,479
are absolutely correct you say you don't

468
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:05,040
want to just move on do not give up

469
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,720
let's try this same plant multiple ways

470
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:08,240
you know that that one way didn't work

471
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,560
let's see if we can get it to work a

472
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,759
couple of other different ways so if

473
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:13,679
you're out there trying to reverse a

474
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,519
plant and it didn't work the first time

475
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:17,439
don't get discouraged i hope you took a

476
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,879
lot of notes i hope you're ready to try

477
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,720
again i hope you didn't have those girl

478
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:22,159
plants all ready to go already and

479
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,920
you've got female plants in the room

480
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:25,759
that are not going to get pollinated i

481
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:28,078
hope we can try again don't get

482
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:30,320
discouraged put science into it put some

483
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:31,679
passion into it that is why femme seeds

484
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,160
are a little bit more expensive you guys

485
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:36,799
we got to do a lot of work to make that

486
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:38,480
stuff work all right my dude uh who did

487
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:40,719
this come from there is no name on this

488
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,959

00:16:57,919 --> 00:17:02,000
one that i picked up right there um

499
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:03,680
we're going to read this one

500
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,519
all right after some shuffling i found

501
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:08,240
the message that i do want to read this

502
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:10,318
one comes from the grow help tab on the

503
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,720
irie genetics website that's right if

504
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:14,519
you visit

505
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:17,120
iregenetics.com

506
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:19,359
iriegenetics.com iriegenetics.com there

507
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:21,359
is a grow help tab if you click on that

508
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:23,198
grow help tab it will ask you a few

509
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:24,879
preliminary questions we ask you what

510
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,400
strains you're growing if you're growing

511
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,240
indoors or outdoors what kind of lights

512
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,160
you're using just basic things like that

513
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,839
to give me an idea of how to help you

514
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,759
then at the bottom it says explain the

515
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:36,399
problem we let you explain your grow

516
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:37,839
problem just a few details on this one

517
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,640
we're growing multiple strains which

518
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:42,159
include hood candy 91 chem to bubba

519
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,320
there's a couple of cool crosses in here

520
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,400
we're growing under leds the plants are

521
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:49,200
in flower it says they're in week 19

522
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,960
that's got to be week 19 overall because

523
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,798
if you're flowering for 19 weeks you're

524
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:57,279
a [ __ ] savage it goes on it says it's

525
00:17:52,798 --> 00:17:59,679
in cocoa it got fed jacks um

526
00:17:57,279 --> 00:18:01,678
the temp is right the humidity is cool

527
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:03,679
then it says the problem

528
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,280
um hey there roster jeff i used to be a

529
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,559
patreon member uh we're not gonna read

530
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:08,160
all that we're gonna so basically the

531
00:18:06,558 --> 00:18:10,480
issue i've been running into is powdery

532
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:12,720
mildew toward the end of flower that is

533
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:15,360
a common issue and i do know why based

534
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:18,079
on the photos that came with this

535
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:20,079
message it says i'm at my wit's end with

536
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:22,639
how to correct this my last run is about

537
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:24,639
six weeks in i had a pm flare-up so i

538
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:27,280
knew i needed to change things up as

539
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:29,360
well as do a super deep clean i need to

540
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:32,160
clean every fan blade and corner of my

541
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:34,879
room so this run and veg i stepped up my

542
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:37,200
ipm with a rotating schedule of defguard

543
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,520
and dr zymes with a final application of

544
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,840
myco stop the day that i flipped as well

545
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:44,400
as i added a 16 inch oscillating fan in

546
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:46,558
my little 4x4 all right so you got a lot

547
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,559
of stuff going on in that 4x4 a lot of

548
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:50,079
preventative sprays however a lot of

549
00:18:48,558 --> 00:18:51,839
those preventative sprays don't stick

550
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:53,599
around long enough you're spraying at

551
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:55,439
the end of edge then you've got that

552
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:57,359
nine week flowering cycle about six

553
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,880
weeks the buds get chunky we get a lot

554
00:18:57,359 --> 00:19:00,959
of activity from the leaves a lot of

555
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,200
water moving around in that small space

556
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,319
then guess what ding ding powdery mildew

557
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,720
pops up

558
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:08,558
it goes on it says i added a second fan

559
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,600
on the floor trying to create a cyclone

560
00:19:08,558 --> 00:19:11,519
effect

561
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:13,599
below the canopy to push any stagnant

562
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:14,960
air up that is a good idea

563
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:16,879
and then it goes on it says so we're

564
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:19,038
about to start week three last night i

565
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:21,520
spotted two leaves with very small spots

566
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:23,440
of powdery mildew on them i'm at my wits

567
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:25,200
end and i'm not sure what else i can do

568
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,759
i'll admit i have some fluctuations in

569
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:30,000
my rh and temp uh never more than 10

570
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:31,919
points yeah more than 10 points that 10

571
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,038
points could be doing it especially with

572
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,880
some of the things that i see in this

573
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:36,480
room we're going to talk about it says

574
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,640
i'm about to do a super heavy

575
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,319
defoliation and i'm hoping that i'll be

576
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,640
able to finish this run out but i fear

577
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:44,558
the worst i'd love to hear your sop for

578
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,160
powdery mildew i think you've heard uh

579
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:48,879
you mentioned cease before but why i

580
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,320
would love your thoughts on this all

581
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,600
right

582
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:53,439
i've got pictures of this room and the

583
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:56,079
first thing that i noticed is that those

584
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,679
plants are way too close together

585
00:19:56,079 --> 00:20:00,159
there are too many plants in there and

586
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:01,919
it is too leafy uh our dude mind's eye

587
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,200
open said they were going to do going to

588
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:05,840
go in the room

589
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,919
and do a heavy defoliation

590
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:09,678
that should have been happening much

591
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:11,840
sooner with as many plants as you've got

592
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:13,679
in there as much foliage as you've got

593
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:15,359
in there you are lucky that it took you

594
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,200
this long to get powdery mildew there's

595
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:18,558
a lot of activity happening in the room

596
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,480
there are a lot of leaves touching there

597
00:20:18,558 --> 00:20:22,000
are a lot of spaces where there are

598
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,319
micro climates in there there's a lot of

599
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,079
moisture a lot of micro climates perfect

600
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:28,558
warmth in that room you're always going

601
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:30,240
to get powdery mildew unless you spread

602
00:20:28,558 --> 00:20:33,599
those plants apart give them some room

603
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:35,519
to breathe and do a an extremely heavy

604
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:37,839
defoliation in that room it needs to be

605
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:39,918
defoliated very heavily i would go in

606
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:41,439
there on day one a flower and take a lot

607
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:43,200
of leaves off then when they grow back i

608
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,038
would go in in week three then i'd go

609
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,720
into week six and then right before

610
00:20:45,038 --> 00:20:48,480
flower i would strip them just about now

611
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,558
right before harvest i would strip them

612
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,319
just about naked you've got a lot of

613
00:20:50,558 --> 00:20:54,879
leaves in that room i wouldn't have half

614
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:57,200
as many leaves in that room as i

615
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,200
excuse me as i see on these plants so

616
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,840
one of the first things to do would be a

617
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,840
heavy heavy defoliation i'd go in there

618
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:05,359
and just take off all of the leaves that

619
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:07,678
you don't think are necessary i did a

620
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:09,519
defoliation episode recently give that a

621
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:11,919
listen anything with a hint of powdery

622
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:13,599
mildew get rid of it then take all of

623
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:16,000
those leaves get them far from the grow

624
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:17,839
the trash the dump the landfill whatever

625
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,359
get rid of them then clean up yourself

626
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:21,279
clean up your scissors clean up

627
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:23,199
everything real well now if you want to

628
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:25,119
talk about integrated pest management to

629
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,880
help get rid of that powdery mildew the

630
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:28,719
first thing we need to do is correct the

631
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,960
plants too much leaf the second thing we

632
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,960
need to do is correct the airflow you

633
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,200
may have a lot of moving air but are you

634
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:37,440
getting rid of the the stagnant air that

635
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,960
old uh sweaty air is that going out

636
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,159
somewhere are you evacuating that

637
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,319
exhausting that some more are you

638
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:44,799
pulling in fresh air somehow that may

639
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:46,960
help you out also let's get a lot of

640
00:21:44,798 --> 00:21:48,720
random movement going on in those plants

641
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,400
a fan is going to move the air one way

642
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,839
all the time let's put another fan in

643
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,000
there to make that air mix you've got

644
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:56,158
one on the floor let's mix the air as

645
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,558
often as possible get a lot of air

646
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:00,480
exchange air mixing new air fresh air no

647
00:21:58,558 --> 00:22:02,639
stagnant pockets in there i think

648
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,240
defoliating will really help your fans

649
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,320
be effective right now the fans aren't

650
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:09,038
working past that first layer of plants

651
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:11,279
every plant that is behind plant number

652
00:22:09,038 --> 00:22:13,919
one is not getting wind there's so much

653
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:15,519
leaf and so much foliage you can't feel

654
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:17,360
the wind through the forest is what i

655
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:20,558
think i'm trying to actually say so

656
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:23,038
defoliate ah adjust the airflow in the

657
00:22:20,558 --> 00:22:25,599
room adjust the air exchange in the room

658
00:22:23,038 --> 00:22:27,440
that will also help you correct the vpd

659
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:29,279
the vapor pressure deficit the relative

660
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,440
humidity and the temperature will be

661
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:32,960
more easily controllable by having less

662
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,798
leaves because the leaves will be

663
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,319
putting out less water you'll have less

664
00:22:34,798 --> 00:22:38,240
humidity in the room it will help you

665
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:40,000
out also save you on some watering time

666
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,200
you'll be able to water less frequently

667
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,200
because you don't have as many leaves in

668
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:45,759
there to keep wet

669
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:48,558
then uh if you really want to talk about

670
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:50,558
more of an integrated uh pest management

671
00:22:48,558 --> 00:22:52,480
strategy to get rid of the uh the

672
00:22:50,558 --> 00:22:54,079
powdery mildew there are a few products

673
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,000
that i do like you did say that you know

674
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:58,158
i mentioned cease cease is a great

675
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,839
product i do like to spray that one i

676
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:02,480
also like a couple of products called

677
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:03,918
b52 and double nickel those are also

678
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,440
great products for taking care of the

679
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:07,919
powdery mildew

680
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,759
also sometimes if it gets real bad i

681
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:13,038
wouldn't be uncommon for me to hit those

682
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:15,919
plants with h2o2 a very very low

683
00:23:13,038 --> 00:23:16,720
dilution of h2o2 or hydrogen peroxide

684
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:18,799
people are going to say that the

685
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,880
hydrogen peroxide and h2o2 are the exact

686
00:23:18,798 --> 00:23:23,200
same thing however they are not there

687
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,960
are other products added into that h2o2

688
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,319
if it was the same thing it would not be

689
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,079
labeled h2o2 i think would just say

690
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:29,918
hydrogen peroxide there's other stuff in

691
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:32,480
that bottle so i've been corrected on

692
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:35,200
that before uh it's a different thing

693
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,960
the 30 hydrogen peroxide and the h2o2

694
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,279
product are different things there's

695
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:41,600
also zero tall xero tall does have other

696
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:43,918
stuff in there uh those are all three

697
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:45,759
similar but different products they will

698
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:48,000
work very well for the powdery mildew

699
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:50,558
that will dissolve the powdery mildew

700
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,119
dilute it very low uh spray it directly

701
00:23:50,558 --> 00:23:55,678
onto the plant wash it watch it wash and

702
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:57,678
eat that powdery mildew right off of

703
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:59,278
your plants all right so those are

704
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:01,360
products i would recommend i would do

705
00:23:59,278 --> 00:24:03,599
the cease the double nickel i think the

706
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:05,038
other one was called b52 what's the one

707
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:06,719
that turns the water purple i can't

708
00:24:05,038 --> 00:24:08,480
remember that one right now grandivo

709
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:11,038
grandivo may be good for powdery mildew

710
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:13,679
if i remember correctly um then also

711
00:24:11,038 --> 00:24:17,519
there is xero tall there is hydrogen

712
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:19,038
peroxide and there is h2o2 please be

713
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:20,639
very careful using those products

714
00:24:19,038 --> 00:24:22,640
they're very caustic they will burn your

715
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,480
skin they will burn your eyes they can

716
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:27,919
burn your plants if you do not dilute

717
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:29,759
them quite properly be careful read the

718
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:32,799
freaking label

719
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:34,879
follow the rules all right um my dude

720
00:24:32,798 --> 00:24:37,200
mine's eye open i hope i gave you some

721
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:39,120
useful advice here uh defoliate that

722
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,960
room dude there are a lot of leaves a

723
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:43,199
lot of foliage a lot of water happening

724
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:45,200
in that room uh the less leaf in the

725
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,038
room the less opportunity for powdery

726
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:49,038
mildew i describe it as if there are no

727
00:24:47,038 --> 00:24:50,480
hotels the hippies won't come to party

728
00:24:49,038 --> 00:24:52,158
if there are no campsites the hippies

729
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,480
won't camp out if you get rid of all the

730
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:56,320
campsites there's nowhere for the bugs

731
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,240
nowhere for the mildew it will give you

732
00:24:56,319 --> 00:25:00,879
some more success set yourself up for

733
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:03,200
success my dude defoliate correct the

734
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:06,000
room then if you still have problems

735
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,679
apply an integrated pest management

736
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,519
strategy that would include i may just

737
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:11,919
spray down that whole room with xero

738
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:14,079
tall or the hydrogen peroxide it may

739
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:15,360
just spray down the whole freaking room

740
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:17,359
just to make sure there's nothing in

741
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:18,798
there just to clean it all up all right

742
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:20,479
