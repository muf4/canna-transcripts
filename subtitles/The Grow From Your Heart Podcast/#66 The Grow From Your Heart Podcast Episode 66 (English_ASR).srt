now that the growing meeting the growers

69
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:31,259

70
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:33,689

71
00:02:31,259 --> 00:02:35,729
26 as I've said before we're working on

72
00:02:33,689 --> 00:02:37,349
a new date I apologize this is beyond my

73
00:02:35,729 --> 00:02:40,439
control this is not me I am only the

74
00:02:37,349 --> 00:02:42,090
messenger here there's a lot going on

75
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:43,590
that I'm not even sure about why it's

76
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:45,509
been changed exactly there are a lot of

77
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:47,969
circumstances so it's beyond my control

78
00:02:45,509 --> 00:02:49,739
to be on Jesse's control we all

79
00:02:47,969 --> 00:02:51,599
apologize but the growers meeting of

80
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:53,909
hydro indoor growing supplies has been

81
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:55,799

82
00:02:53,909 --> 00:02:58,650

looking forward to meeting you I had

85
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:04,500
some [ __ ] written down either way I did

86
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:05,879
write some stuff that I want to talk

87
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,189
about on the podcast in a future episode

88
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:10,349
so I said we're gonna talk about grow

89
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:12,150
room scheduling like planning out a

90
00:03:10,349 --> 00:03:14,280
routine and a pattern for your room so

91
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:15,569
that you can have a productive room I'm

92
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,890
still gonna write that out completely

93
00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:20,909

94
00:03:16,889 --> 00:03:22,048
podcast anyway all right so what else do

95
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:23,129

96
00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:24,930
right let's get down to it I'm gonna

97
00:03:23,129 --> 00:03:26,729
drop the music out cuz that's highly

98
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:28,049
distracting to me we'll just lower that

99
00:03:26,729 --> 00:03:29,548

100

101
00:03:29,549 --> 00:03:33,719
I took a bunch of notes because uh it

102
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:34,969
was a long weekend I want to try to

103
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:38,789

104
00:03:34,969 --> 00:03:42,060
excuse me I'm burping um so the cannabis

105
00:03:38,789 --> 00:03:45,259
cup was Saturday Sunday and Monday in

106
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:48,030
Denver at a place called the Denver Mart

107

58th Street 925 it's at 50th in

109
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:55,949
Washington was where most of the action

110
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:57,569
was um there was no but there was a lot

111
00:03:55,949 --> 00:04:00,719
of parking but it was all [ __ ] a

112
00:03:57,569 --> 00:04:02,579
[ __ ] it cost 30 bucks to park in

113
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:04,709
most places told me back up we'll talk

114
00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:05,939
about Friday night um cuz Friday nights

115
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:07,590
when it all kind of started for me you

116
00:04:05,939 --> 00:04:09,780
guys heard about my Morgan heritage

117
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:11,099
concert adventure and then Thursday I

118
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:13,289
went and got stoned with the reggae

119
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:15,000
bands and Hydro right so that was the

120
00:04:13,289 --> 00:04:18,810
last episode so I left you guys off on

121
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,810
Thursday Friday night I packed up headed

122
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:23,788
to Denver the weather was terrible it

123
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:25,259
rained the entire drive to Denver that's

124
00:04:23,788 --> 00:04:26,469
a hundred and twenty five miles it took

125
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:28,120
me close to

126
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:30,670
ah two and a half hours just to get to

127
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:34,180
the south end of Denver I drove to

128
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:37,210
garden of Weeden had a Airbnb spot just

129
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:39,370
outside of Boulder I was almost a

130
00:04:37,209 --> 00:04:42,189
boulder honestly I was in Louisville

131
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:43,810
Colorado it was a gorgeous little beat

132
00:04:42,189 --> 00:04:45,129
Airbnb house and they got their sweet

133
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:46,030
score but it was kind of far out of the

134
00:04:45,129 --> 00:04:47,889
way for me anyway

135
00:04:46,029 --> 00:04:49,599
I drove out there I got dabbed out with

136
00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:50,949
some of the crew from garden of Weeden I

137
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,260
wanted to meet up with those guys hang

138
00:04:50,949 --> 00:04:54,789
out with them on a Friday night which

139
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:57,459
I'm glad I did because they've been busy

140
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:58,750
as [ __ ] since then so I hung out God AB

141
00:04:57,459 --> 00:05:00,399
doubt with the garden of Weeden crew

142
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:02,350
then I headed back to the hotel like I

143
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:03,939
kind of hungry got kind of tired so I

144
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:05,680
headed back to the hotel my hotel is

145
00:05:03,939 --> 00:05:06,969
super cozy I was glad I got that room

146
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,230
that I got it was cheap so I was a

147
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:09,760
little questioning I was kind of

148
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:11,470
questioning on what how it was gonna be

149
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,909
there's affordable and it was cozy

150
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:14,950
there's a great room for one guy that

151
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:16,570
was a little bed a couch a desk a TV I

152
00:05:14,949 --> 00:05:18,789
barely turned on the TV as used as a

153
00:05:16,569 --> 00:05:20,199
nightlight mainly I got some pizza

154
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:22,030
delivered and I would just sleep I said

155
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:23,409
I hate the [ __ ] out of some pizza some

156
00:05:22,029 --> 00:05:25,899
local pizza that was around there and

157
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:29,230
then I went to sleep Saturday morning I

158
00:05:25,899 --> 00:05:32,168
woke up kind of early I get to the cup

159
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:33,700
around 9:00 I was about 8:30 8:45 when I

160
00:05:32,168 --> 00:05:37,539
got to the cup the parking lots were

161
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:39,729
starting to get full already but there

162
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:41,439
was one spot I found that was open right

163
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:44,050
away right near the gate it cost me 30

164
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:45,519
bucks to park about 30 feet from the

165
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:47,770
gate that I needed to use so I parked my

166
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:49,959
car I got myself organized they headed

167
00:05:47,769 --> 00:05:51,728
into the cup is about 9:00 I had a

168
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:52,989
vendor wristband so I was able to get in

169
00:05:51,728 --> 00:05:54,789
before everybody else the event doesn't

170
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:56,410

171
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:58,390
wristband really helped me out I got in

172
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:59,860
at 9:00 I was gonna need to see the

173
00:05:58,389 --> 00:06:01,750
cannabis cup come together when I walked

174
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:03,189
in I was just a bunch of empty spaces

175
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:05,319
with square booths and a bunch of

176
00:06:03,189 --> 00:06:06,910
walkways on the people were emptying

177
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:09,279
everything out of boxes and everyone was

178
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:10,900
all frantic and moving around I wasn't

179
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:12,099
the smoke fest that you guys saw that

180
00:06:10,899 --> 00:06:15,399
everybody that went there saw it was

181
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:17,080
chaos people look stressed it [ __ ] so

182
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:18,969
anyway by noon the place was packed and

183
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:20,680
jumping I got an early

184
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:22,180
I immediately started linking up with

185
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,829
people that I know there were it only

186
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:25,449
took me a few seconds to walk in and see

187
00:06:23,829 --> 00:06:27,219
people that I know also I need to give a

188
00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:29,110
big shout out to Robert and Anita I

189
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:30,280
don't know if they listen to the podcast

190
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:34,598
or not but I have some friends that are

191
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:36,309
local friends I bumped into so there's a

192
00:06:34,598 --> 00:06:38,709
big-ass line outside the cup right and

193
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:40,449
there was a vendor entrance and I just

194
00:06:38,709 --> 00:06:42,370
walked right in it nobody asked me

195
00:06:40,449 --> 00:06:44,169
for any credentials I never showed a

196
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:45,879
wristband I never showed her an ID I

197
00:06:44,168 --> 00:06:47,889
never showed a ticket I walked right in

198
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:49,270
that son of a [ __ ] right past everybody

199
00:06:47,889 --> 00:06:50,528
right into the thing I was in the

200
00:06:49,269 --> 00:06:53,258
cannabis cup at 9:00 a.m. while

201
00:06:50,528 --> 00:06:53,588
everybody else is waiting in line and so

202
00:06:53,259 --> 00:06:55,360
uh

203
00:06:53,588 --> 00:06:57,129
I'm a kind guy I bumped into Robert and

204
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,479
Anita while I was in line or while I was

205
00:06:57,129 --> 00:06:59,259
walking from the car I saw them they

206
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:01,688
were going to actually use a

207
00:06:59,259 --> 00:07:03,009
port-a-potty and I I thought well should

208
00:07:01,689 --> 00:07:04,300
I saw my friends I should call them and

209
00:07:03,009 --> 00:07:05,710
tell them about this so I invited them

210
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,960
to come join me and I met them over by

211
00:07:05,709 --> 00:07:09,878
another area of theirs inside the van

212
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:10,838
and then they walked around with me for

213
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:14,800
a little while and hung out so that was

214
00:07:10,838 --> 00:07:16,269
fun yeah so big shot - Robert and Anita

215
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,288
for keeping me company for the first

216
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:19,748
part of the morning there that was kind

217
00:07:17,288 --> 00:07:20,829
of fun actually I knew a lot of people

218
00:07:19,749 --> 00:07:22,360
there at the cup and they kind of got

219
00:07:20,829 --> 00:07:23,800
annoyed that every 10 feet we would walk

220
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,479
somebody would bump into me and take a

221
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,680
picture with us and hang out them they

222
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:27,818
wanted to go cannabis cup so they

223
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,959
ditched me which they didn't really

224
00:07:27,819 --> 00:07:32,319
teach me they told me they're taking off

225
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:33,698
which was cool so Robert and he took off

226
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,990
and had fun left me wandering around for

227
00:07:33,699 --> 00:07:37,658
myself for a little while I bumped into

228
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:39,579
so many people actually I went to a

229
00:07:37,658 --> 00:07:42,519
booth I was looking to dab I wanted a

230
00:07:39,579 --> 00:07:45,098
dad and I ran into Johnny be from no

231
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:46,598
goon on stick and he had a cool booth

232
00:07:45,098 --> 00:07:48,278
and he said what's up and his crew said

233
00:07:46,598 --> 00:07:49,990
hi to me and at the back of their booth

234
00:07:48,278 --> 00:07:54,249
they shared a booth with some other

235
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:55,509
people and these fellers man I feel like

236
00:07:54,249 --> 00:07:57,069
a dick right now because there were two

237
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:58,120
brothers they looked at Fairley's very

238
00:07:57,069 --> 00:07:59,830
very similar

239
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:01,449
I got him confused multiple times I

240
00:07:59,829 --> 00:08:03,098
learned - by the end of the weekend but

241
00:08:01,449 --> 00:08:04,959
one dude's name was Ari and there's a

242
00:08:03,098 --> 00:08:06,430
brother with dreadlocks and there was

243
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:06,999
another guy that looked very much like

244
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:08,918
Ari

245
00:08:06,999 --> 00:08:10,810
they gave me you can hear the parchment

246
00:08:08,918 --> 00:08:12,818
paper right now they gave me a little

247
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:14,889
everyone's giving out their shatter in

248
00:08:12,819 --> 00:08:16,240
these little envelopes is a little the I

249
00:08:14,889 --> 00:08:19,060
think they used to be four coins rating

250
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:21,550
these little coin envelopes this one is

251
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:25,569
labeled MOT extractions cheese nug run

252
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:26,709
one gram so they gave me this and I've

253
00:08:25,569 --> 00:08:28,060
still got quite a bit of it left what

254
00:08:26,709 --> 00:08:30,098
I'm gonna do right now for you guys for

255
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:32,110
MOT extractions I'm gonna take a dab of

256
00:08:30,098 --> 00:08:33,519
this cheesenut run but I honestly

257
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:34,870
already know that I love it but I want

258
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:38,110
to take a dab of it until you oh that's

259
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:39,788
not too big of tablets here we go we

260
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:42,278

261
00:08:39,788 --> 00:08:45,220
here we'll talk about some MOT

262
00:08:42,278 --> 00:08:46,929
extractions nug Ron this was the first

263
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:48,699
dab that I took at the Cannabis Cup so

264
00:08:46,929 --> 00:08:50,049
this was how I walked into the cup this

265
00:08:48,698 --> 00:08:52,769
is what I was introduced with so I'm

266
00:08:50,049 --> 00:08:52,769
gonna take a dab of it

267
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:08,809
all right I took a nice chunky size dad

268
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:10,220
wasn't too ridiculous good and chunky

269
00:09:08,809 --> 00:09:14,659
though there's a good dab there's no

270
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:18,860
cough so I'll talk about the flavor the

271
00:09:14,659 --> 00:09:20,899
flavor is very smooth it doesn't taste

272
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:25,340
like cheese to me or the stream the

273
00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:26,990
cheese I get kind of a there's some

274
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:29,240
sweetness to it there's a little bit of

275
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:30,470
funk to it you know the cheese is

276
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,909
setting it now that it's a draw my

277
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:33,230
tongue is kind of absorbing it a little

278
00:09:31,909 --> 00:09:35,569
the cottonmouth thing is kicking in I

279
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:40,610

330
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:17,930
first day together I walked around

331
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:20,870

335
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:28,430
of packs of seeds that was kind of nice

336
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:30,230

the first day I spent some time at that

340
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:39,949
booth it was great but uh honestly I had

341
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:41,389
more seed sales by walking around and I

342
00:11:39,948 --> 00:11:42,740
got to see more people so I've been in

343
00:11:41,389 --> 00:11:45,470

it was a great time so I also got a lot

345
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:49,910
of compliments on the podcast that was

346
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:51,589
really cool I expected more reaction to

347
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:53,088
the seeds and whatnot I thought people

348
00:11:51,589 --> 00:11:54,740
would be more interested in my beans but

349
00:11:53,089 --> 00:11:57,139
a lot of people knew who I was because

350
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:59,629
of the podcast so it's gonna neat that

351
00:11:57,139 --> 00:12:03,829

358
00:12:11,629 --> 00:12:14,958

360

362
00:12:18,019 --> 00:12:21,799
that's where I was it got [ __ ] cold

363
00:12:19,909 --> 00:12:24,259
you guys all weekend the weather kept

364
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:25,609
changing so we got cold this is Saturday

365
00:12:24,259 --> 00:12:27,649
night so I headed back to the hotel room

366
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:29,269
to warm up get some food I had some of

367
00:12:27,649 --> 00:12:30,470
that pizza that I had left over from the

368
00:12:29,269 --> 00:12:32,720
night before that was pretty big

369
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:34,129
Alicia's I actually took a couple fatty

370
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,790
dabs and fell asleep for a couple hours

371
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:39,019
cuz I got a sunburn I was up early but

372
00:12:37,789 --> 00:12:41,000
after that I woke up and I headed to a

373
00:12:39,019 --> 00:12:46,459
private party there's a private party

374
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:48,589
outside the oriental theater and so we

375
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:50,239
weren't able to smoke in the theater I

376
00:12:48,589 --> 00:12:52,279
never even made it inside the theater

377
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,539
honestly it was loud as [ __ ] and crowded

378
00:12:52,278 --> 00:12:55,278
but we weren't able to smoke in there

379
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:56,870
because the fire department the police

380
00:12:55,278 --> 00:12:59,509
and the meed were all doing random

381
00:12:56,870 --> 00:13:01,039
inspections on clubs that weekend to see

382
00:12:59,509 --> 00:13:02,360
who was smoking cuz they knew people are

383
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:04,879
gonna be smoking in clubs and it's

384
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:07,639
illegal to smoke in places so we weren't

385
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:10,490
allowed to smoke in there so we found a

386
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:11,810
way around it and I guess since the

387
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:12,919
party's over excuse me I'm burping I

388
00:13:11,809 --> 00:13:14,929
guess since the party is over I could

389
00:13:12,919 --> 00:13:17,179
blow up the spot this is how we did it

390
00:13:14,929 --> 00:13:17,659
outside the theater these people Park to

391
00:13:17,179 --> 00:13:20,239
tour

392
00:13:17,659 --> 00:13:22,039
is one of the tour buses had a private

393
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,110
party and since the bus is private

394
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:25,610
nobody can come in and tell us that we

395
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:27,200
can't smoke there the cops aren't even

396
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:29,240
welcome on the bus without a warrant or

397
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,770
unless a crime happens in there the fire

398
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:32,450
department has no damn reason in the

399
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:36,079
meed is definitely not coming on a

400
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:37,129
private tour bus so some some of our

401
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,300

439
00:14:48,919 --> 00:14:52,729
the people that I saw because I will

440
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:55,129
forget more people than I remembered it

441
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:57,740
was a huge weekend and I got a sunburn I

442
00:14:55,129 --> 00:14:59,000
got dabbed out and I recently had a head

443
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:01,430
injury and I feel like I don't remember

444
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,309
as much [ __ ] as I should but uh for

445
00:15:01,429 --> 00:15:06,049
Sunday I slept in a little because it

446
00:15:04,309 --> 00:15:07,579
wore myself out Saturday I definitely

447
00:15:06,049 --> 00:15:10,729
was exhausted I slept in a little I

448
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:12,650
headed to the cup around lunchtime I got

449
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:14,000
smart go to the grocery store and got a

450
00:15:12,649 --> 00:15:15,439
bunch of fruit and since I had the

451
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,299
vendor wristband I was able to take some

452
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,770
fruit and some healthy drinks into my

453
00:15:17,299 --> 00:15:20,000
backpack with me and sneak those in

454
00:15:18,769 --> 00:15:21,590
because I didn't have a security thing

455
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,330
to go through all the normal people had

456
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:24,769
to go through security I got the little

457
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:25,910
VIP vendor pass so I just got to walk

458
00:15:24,769 --> 00:15:26,329
right past all that [ __ ] that was

459
00:15:25,909 --> 00:15:29,000
awesome

460
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:30,180
so do that dad is working by the way

461
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,589
that

462
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:36,088
he's definitely kicking in so yeah I

463
00:15:34,589 --> 00:15:37,440
slept in a little took some fruit with

464
00:15:36,089 --> 00:15:39,270
me so I had some food it took me about

465
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,310
an hour to park that day from the time I

466
00:15:39,269 --> 00:15:43,169
got you know what before I got to the

467
00:15:41,309 --> 00:15:46,500
58th Street exit traffic was already

468
00:15:43,169 --> 00:15:47,849
backed up on the exit and it took me 15

469
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,860
minutes to get from the exit to the

470
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:51,870
parking areas and then I had to drive

471
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:54,360
around for another 20 or 30 to find a

472
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:58,769
parking spot and the parking cost me 20

473
00:15:54,360 --> 00:16:00,180
or 30 bucks each day so I got into the

474
00:15:58,769 --> 00:16:02,179
cup I wandered around and then

475
00:16:00,179 --> 00:16:04,169
eventually I bumped into Jay again ah

476
00:16:02,179 --> 00:16:05,669
her and I walked around the cup and

477
00:16:04,169 --> 00:16:08,219
bumped into a bunch of friends until we

478
00:16:05,669 --> 00:16:09,449
decided we needed some serious dabs at

479
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:10,980
the Cannabis Cup you'd think there's a

480
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:12,810
lot of places to hang out take some dabs

481
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:15,959
but there's really not a lot of comfy

482
00:16:12,809 --> 00:16:17,519
places to just chill out and smoke there

483
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:20,399
are some VIP areas and [ __ ] but they

484
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:23,490
fill up quickly so my friend Jay and I

485
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:25,139
Julie we found a loading dock area and

486
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:26,730
now we made a little dab area for

487
00:16:25,139 --> 00:16:27,958
ourselves and got comfy there and just

488
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:30,720
dabbed out and took a bunch of selfies

489
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:32,099
and had a good time for a few so Sunday

490
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,600
was a really fun day it was more relaxed

491
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:35,310
on Saturday Saturday was kind of crowded

492
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,300
it's gonna hustle and bustle II cuz

493
00:16:35,309 --> 00:16:37,379
everyone's trying to meet up with all

494
00:16:36,299 --> 00:16:38,519
their friends it's like the first day of

495
00:16:37,379 --> 00:16:40,019
school I haven't seen a lot of those

496
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:42,629
people in close to a year if not a year

497
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:43,559
so I was mostly pumping in her friends

498
00:16:42,629 --> 00:16:45,028
and hanging out with Jay until the

499
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:49,619
evening when we headed to the award

500
00:16:45,028 --> 00:16:51,149
ceremony let's see yeah the award

501
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:52,470
ceremony was Saturday night sir there's

502
00:16:51,149 --> 00:16:53,759
a three-day event so I'm confused by

503
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:54,959
that I get [ __ ] up on that all the

504
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,278
time usually you do the awards at the

505
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:58,139
last day but they didn't which we'll

506
00:16:56,278 --> 00:17:00,208
talk about something on that also so

507
00:16:58,139 --> 00:17:02,009
until the award ceremony the highlight

508
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:04,490
of my day was probably hanging out and

509
00:17:02,009 --> 00:17:07,049
eating lunch with Addison de Moura

510
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:08,699
the lines were really long at all the

511
00:17:07,049 --> 00:17:12,209
food trucks but there's one food truck

512
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:14,400
that serves organic gluten-free food and

513
00:17:12,209 --> 00:17:17,068
it's funny cuz there's chicken legs hot

514
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,509
dogs burgers french fries all kinds of

515
00:17:17,068 --> 00:17:20,250
food trucks right and then in the middle

516
00:17:18,509 --> 00:17:22,230
there's this one little blue baby blue

517
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:25,828
food truck that sells salads for nine

518
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:27,808
bucks I got a salad with some chopped up

519
00:17:25,828 --> 00:17:29,308
strawberries and some blueberries and

520
00:17:27,808 --> 00:17:30,779
some fruit that I couldn't identify it

521
00:17:29,308 --> 00:17:32,460
was delicious I mean it was good I just

522
00:17:30,779 --> 00:17:33,869
don't know what the hell it was and then

523
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:36,000
in the bottom there were chunks of feta

524
00:17:33,869 --> 00:17:37,558
and then every time I stirred it I found

525
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,329
another layer of goodness in there but

526
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:41,789
there was honey all over it for dressing

527
00:17:39,329 --> 00:17:42,899
I was nine bucks but that was like the

528
00:17:41,789 --> 00:17:44,909
most

529
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:46,110
most edible stuff I'm a vegetarian and I

530
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:48,360
try to eat well so I was the most edible

531
00:17:46,109 --> 00:17:49,709
stuff there so that line was two people

532
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:51,719
long there's two people in front of me

533
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:53,880
and I had my food in less than like five

534
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:56,549
minutes Jay wanted some food from

535
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:58,890
another car and she waited in line for

536
00:17:56,549 --> 00:18:01,079
the entire time that I was in line plus

537
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:02,430
the time that I ate my food plus a

538
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:04,019
little bit longer

539
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:06,269
some people walked by and saw me at a

540
00:18:04,019 --> 00:18:07,650
table and I was sitting at a table where

541
00:18:06,269 --> 00:18:08,819
four people could fit and they saw me

542
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:09,930
there by myself and they like hey dude

543
00:18:08,819 --> 00:18:11,700
can we eat with you and as like well

544
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:14,009
[ __ ] yeah you got plenty of time and

545
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:15,360
those people ate their meals cleaned up

546
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:17,609
after themselves shook my hand said

547
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:18,750
goodbye and took off before Jay even got

548
00:18:17,609 --> 00:18:20,159
her food that's how long some of the

549
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:22,679
food lines were ah

550
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,870
so since I'm sitting by the organic food

551
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:27,150
truck eating my food my buddy Addison

552
00:18:24,869 --> 00:18:29,099
tomorrow walked up and sat down and

553
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:30,330
ordered food at the food truck and then

554
00:18:29,099 --> 00:18:32,369
after that he came and sat down with me

555
00:18:30,329 --> 00:18:33,808
and I think having lunch with that he

556
00:18:32,369 --> 00:18:36,139
might have been my highlight of my

557
00:18:33,808 --> 00:18:38,369
afternoon up until the awards ceremony

558
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:39,780
Addison is a busy man and it seems like

559
00:18:38,369 --> 00:18:41,879
everybody at the Cannabis Cup knew him

560
00:18:39,779 --> 00:18:43,558
so getting an hour out of his life for

561
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:45,720
him to just sit down and hang out not

562
00:18:43,558 --> 00:18:48,000
talk business to just be my bro for an

563
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:49,440
hour and hang out ketchup was really an

564
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,329
honor so shout out to Addison I hope you

565
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,980
get to hear this bro so after a bunch of

566
00:18:51,329 --> 00:18:54,899
dabs with Addison and dab so hard and

567
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:56,490
Julie joined us at the table we made

568
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,809
another friend at the table too I cannot

569
00:18:56,490 --> 00:19:00,390
remember her name her name might have

570
00:18:57,808 --> 00:19:02,190
been Elise yeah it was uh her name was

571
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:03,600
Elise she was a medical cannabis user

572
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:05,070
and she uses cannabis for several

573
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:07,230
reasons and she was just waiting for her

574
00:19:05,069 --> 00:19:08,609
friend and lion also and so she sat down

575
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:10,049
and ate with me and since she ate with

576
00:19:08,609 --> 00:19:11,490
me when she was done I gave her some

577
00:19:10,049 --> 00:19:14,279
dabs just like the rest of the true and

578
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:18,929
she really appreciated it I misjudged

579
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:20,339
that lady she was I don't even want to

580
00:19:18,929 --> 00:19:22,830
guess how old she was older than me and

581
00:19:20,339 --> 00:19:24,629
she seemed all nice and kind but she

582
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:27,119
took a DAB like a [ __ ] champion I

583
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:29,130
should have given her larger dabs it's

584
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:30,269
pretty funny so after the a bunch of

585
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:32,820
dabs and she was time for the award

586
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:34,859
ceremony the award ceremony was really

587
00:19:32,819 --> 00:19:36,689
neat and it's kind of chaos like High

588
00:19:34,859 --> 00:19:38,039
Times always is they made the first

589
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:39,420
award they made a mistake they announced

590
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:40,710
the third place is the first place in

591
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:42,720
the first place is a third place and it

592
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:46,350
was always already chaos but that's how

593
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,640
High Times likes to do [ __ ] so they

594
00:19:46,349 --> 00:19:51,209
finally got their [ __ ] together Vader

595
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:52,380
won the first three awards we'll talk

596
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:53,789
about that in a minute but one thing

597
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:55,350
that really stood out to me was when

598
00:19:53,789 --> 00:19:56,769
High Times brought out two members of

599
00:19:55,349 --> 00:20:01,119
the Jamaican

600
00:19:56,769 --> 00:20:02,980
farmers association one guy was he had

601
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:05,439
short hair and wore a jacket and then

602
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:09,059
the other guy was taller and had

603
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:11,200
dreadlocks to his ass and he was the

604
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:13,419
representative of the Rasta community

605
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:16,110
and these guys spoke about legalization

606
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:18,700
in Jamaica and they announced that the

607
00:20:16,109 --> 00:20:21,429
High Times would be hosting a cannabis

608
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:24,130
cup on the island of Jamaica in November

609
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:25,990
so I'm thinking about going but honestly

610
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:28,120
I don't know if I want to travel to

611
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:31,809
Jamaica for a cannabis cup it might not

612
00:20:28,119 --> 00:20:33,519
be the most financially sound idea but

613
00:20:31,809 --> 00:20:35,019
you gotta do it you gotta do sometimes

614
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:37,389
I'll think about it and a lot of things

615
00:20:35,019 --> 00:20:38,889
I'm thinking about one thing I thought

616
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:41,910
was funny when the Jamaican came out the

617
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:44,650
Jamaican guy the Rasta started speaking

618
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:46,300
he said greetings in the name of the

619
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:48,490
Most High his Imperial Majesty King

620
00:20:46,299 --> 00:20:50,279
Haile Selassie I had the first jaw and

621
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:53,440
all of the Rastas in the room yield

622
00:20:50,279 --> 00:20:55,119
Rastafari and a guy behind me bumped his

623
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,700
buddy on the shoulder and said what did

624
00:20:55,119 --> 00:21:00,429
he just say and I jokingly turned back

625
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:01,990
and politely said he said hello I

626
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:03,640
thought it was pretty funny because the

627
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:06,490
dude behind me had no idea what this old

628
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:08,320
Rasta man just said so I was really

629
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:10,059
excited to see a Rasta man come out at

630
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:11,439
the Cannabis Cup and tell me that

631
00:21:10,059 --> 00:21:12,909
there's gonna be a cannabis cup in

632
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,410
Jamaica in November that was kind of

633
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:16,060
neat just to see some true Rastas come

634
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:18,670
and get to celebrate Rastafari at the

635
00:21:16,059 --> 00:21:21,250

636

650
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:53,350
wound right and I didn't feel good for a

651
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:54,880
few days and I went to Spence's to go

652
00:21:53,349 --> 00:21:57,250
kick back just to get away and he had

653
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,830
just made the cup entry and he's like

654
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:02,140
try this dog it's my CBD entry and I hit

655
00:21:59,829 --> 00:22:04,599
it and it tasted like I just bit into

656
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:06,730
oranges it tastes like I had a mouthful

657
00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:08,389
of delicious sweet oranges I'm drooling

658
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:12,620
down I kind of want an orange me

659
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:14,780
but and I blew it out and I had had a

660
00:22:12,619 --> 00:22:16,069
concussion and it felt like I had a belt

661
00:22:14,779 --> 00:22:17,509
tied around my head I feel like just

662
00:22:16,069 --> 00:22:20,029
pressure around my head when I blew out

663
00:22:17,509 --> 00:22:21,980
this dab it felt like you undid the belt

664
00:22:20,029 --> 00:22:23,660
a couple of notches then he gave me a

665
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:25,910
couple more dabs and I looked at him and

666
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:27,920
I was like bro I am the most comfortable

667
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:29,840
right now that I have been in several

668
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:31,850
days because I was in pain and my head

669
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:34,369
hurt and I wasn't feeling right and

670
00:22:31,849 --> 00:22:36,889
those dabs like sent me right dude and

671
00:22:34,369 --> 00:22:39,049
he told me he said you look like you're

672
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:41,180
the best you've been in a few days like

673
00:22:39,049 --> 00:22:42,529
I guess people could physically see that

674
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:45,560
I didn't feel good I didn't realize I

675
00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:47,869

00:23:55,099 --> 00:23:59,329
great strain if you listen to the

episode I did with Angela about CBD

713
00:23:59,329 --> 00:24:02,389
medicine canna tonic might have been the

714
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,670
culprit there that was the high CBD

715
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:06,500
medicine so a big shot at two natural

1016
00:35:09,949 --> 00:35:13,549

off the plate I don't know how that dude

1018
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:19,550
was able to eat that looked good so I

1019
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:20,809
mentioned Vader

1020
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:22,340
right let's talk about something that I

1021
00:35:20,809 --> 00:35:25,099
found kind of disrespectful at the

1022
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:25,960
Cannabis Cup a company called Vader won

1023
00:35:25,099 --> 00:35:27,848
several war

1024
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:29,829
they won the first three awards that

1025
00:35:27,849 --> 00:35:32,440
were given away at the cup they had a

1026
00:35:29,829 --> 00:35:33,910
huge set up at the they had a place

1027
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:35,920
called invader village in the cannabis

1028
00:35:33,909 --> 00:35:37,929
cup is a huge set up with a stage I've

1029
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:39,760
had live musical acts they had semi

1030
00:35:37,929 --> 00:35:41,618
famous celebrities at the booths all day

1031
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:43,030
my friend had a mill was that are

1032
00:35:41,619 --> 00:35:45,039
launching prizes into the crowd he had

1033
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:47,559
the t-shirt gun the t-shirt cannon he

1034
00:35:45,039 --> 00:35:51,608
would fill it up with packages of

1035
00:35:47,559 --> 00:35:53,440
shatter and launch and joints and bags a

1036
00:35:51,608 --> 00:35:55,469
weed and launch bags of weed and shatter

1037
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:57,490
and joints into the crowd of people

1038
00:35:55,469 --> 00:35:58,808
people would go nuts and get it so

1039
00:35:57,489 --> 00:36:00,608
they'd win best booth they want all

1040
00:35:58,809 --> 00:36:02,200
kinds of prizes right this is Saturday

1041
00:36:00,608 --> 00:36:04,000
night the cup happens Sunday or Monday

1042
00:36:02,199 --> 00:36:07,000
this was Sunday night when they went

1043
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,380
everything Monday is 4/20 everyone

1044
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,568
smoked right we show up for the cup

1045
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:13,660
Vader village is gone they have taken

1046
00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:16,480
down their entire booth tore down

1047
00:36:13,659 --> 00:36:17,588
everything the day after they win and

1048
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,929
they just take all their [ __ ] down they

1049
00:36:17,588 --> 00:36:22,269
won several awards and they packed up at

1050
00:36:19,929 --> 00:36:24,190
night while everyone was asleep and they

1051
00:36:22,269 --> 00:36:26,739
took off Monday before the cup open at

1052
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:28,119
noon and that just seems disrespectful

1053
00:36:26,739 --> 00:36:29,409
to me like if you're gonna come to a

1054
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:31,390
competition if you're gonna come to an

1055
00:36:29,409 --> 00:36:33,399
event and you're gonna build a big-ass

1056
00:36:31,389 --> 00:36:35,529
stage and make a big spectacle then you

1057
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:37,030
win hang out for the last day and play

1058
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:38,500
with all the cool kids don't be a dick

1059
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:41,460
and leave I just found that

1060
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:44,190
disrespectful it's not even my event but

1061
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:46,420
whatever I found that rude so hey

1062
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:49,030
congrats on all your wins Vader but that

1063
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:50,380
was not a classy move to do that um so

1064
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:52,630
let's move on a little bit this leads me

1065
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:54,220
into Monday Monday was day three of the

1066
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:56,500
cannabis cup monday was 4/20 and the

1067
00:36:54,219 --> 00:36:59,230
place was super crowded the weather had

1068
00:36:56,500 --> 00:37:01,960
been sketchy all weekend so at some

1069
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:03,579
point I was wearing a t-shirt and I was

1070
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:05,318
sweating and then other times I was had

1071
00:37:03,579 --> 00:37:08,140
a hoodie on with my hood up and I was

1072
00:37:05,318 --> 00:37:11,349
freezing so the weather was super

1073
00:37:08,139 --> 00:37:12,818
sketchy Monday had a nice break in the

1074
00:37:11,349 --> 00:37:14,140
weather so it felt like everybody showed

1075
00:37:12,818 --> 00:37:15,670
up for the last part of the day like

1076
00:37:14,139 --> 00:37:17,739

1077
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:21,880

1078
00:37:17,739 --> 00:37:23,289

1120
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:45,220
what the hell did he call it promotional

1121

got to see him record that I've kind of

1123
00:38:47,769 --> 00:38:50,889
got some hookups at the comedy work so I

1139
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:24,099
things my friend Clint that has been on

1140

1150
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:47,230
back to the note so don't skip anything

1151
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:51,850
but I think the next part that I want to

1152
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:54,699
do is I'm gonna do a couple shout outs

1153
00:39:51,849 --> 00:39:57,339
so Josh my friend Josh won second place

1154
00:39:54,699 --> 00:39:59,339
in the Adam Dunn show Invitational which

1155
00:39:57,340 --> 00:40:01,870

1156
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:03,640

1160
00:40:07,269 --> 00:40:11,170

1164
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:18,340

1165
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:19,780

1167
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:23,080
should be proud of himself

1168
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:25,600
let's see shout out to Josh we got that

1169
00:40:23,079 --> 00:40:27,869
covered Oh take dabs and review them see

1170
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:30,039
that's the part I'm excited about

1171
00:40:27,869 --> 00:40:31,750
sometimes it pays to be Ross to Jeff and

1172
00:40:30,039 --> 00:40:33,159
have a little podcast because while I

1173
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:35,230
was if the cannabis cup somebody walked

1174
00:40:33,159 --> 00:40:36,940
up to me and this happened two days in a

1175
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:38,980
row he walked up to me and he handed me

1176
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:41,800
these little packages and it says

1177
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:42,849
electrum extracts I'm just gonna pull

1178
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:44,620
this whole thing out of here it's kind

1179
00:40:42,849 --> 00:40:46,630
of hard to read there we go

1180
00:40:44,619 --> 00:40:47,980
there are little smelly proof bags and

1181
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:49,269
it's got the smelly proof logo right

1182
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:50,920
over his logo so I'm gonna take it out

1183
00:40:49,269 --> 00:40:52,570
so I could see it it says electrum

1184
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:54,340
extracts and you unfold it on the other

1185
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:56,559
side it says lemon skunk times banana

1186
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:59,110
cush contains 100% organic cannabis

1187
00:40:56,559 --> 00:41:01,000
whole plant extracted via and butane and

1188
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:03,280
propane mix in a closed-loop extraction

1189
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:07,480
system and as Instagram check this out

1190
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:09,640
as electrum extracts elec TR um extracts

1191
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:11,530
on instagram then it says not for use by

1192
00:41:09,639 --> 00:41:14,230

1193
00:41:11,530 --> 00:41:16,269
handed me some butane hash oil my

1194

1195

1196
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:23,579

1197

1199
00:41:27,309 --> 00:41:32,110
for all my tools right now cleaning off

1200
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:33,849
the carb cap unwrapping the parchments a

1201
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:35,110
nice friendly portion he gave me - I've

1202
00:41:33,849 --> 00:41:36,789
already dabbed a few dabs so I don't

1203
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:39,210
remember what it would have weighed but

1204
00:41:36,789 --> 00:41:43,719
I'm gonna take a decent-sized dab here

1205
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:47,679
and then we'll talk about it there we go

1206
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:49,059
this is electrum extracts um but lemons

1207
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:50,500
gonna been out of cush dab with me if

1208
00:41:49,059 --> 00:41:52,059

1209
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:54,329

1210
00:41:52,059 --> 00:41:54,329
dab

1211
00:42:03,108 --> 00:42:07,380
it tastes good in the weigh-in usually

1212
00:42:05,759 --> 00:42:09,449
you don't taste good smoke until the way

1213
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:13,798
out and that tastes citrusy and lemony

1214
00:42:09,449 --> 00:42:15,749
on the way in alright I definitely taste

1215
00:42:13,798 --> 00:42:18,679
the lemons I don't taste the banana cush

1216
00:42:15,748 --> 00:42:21,418
bar but I taste the lemon spunk for sure

1217
00:42:18,679 --> 00:42:22,979
and here's something I noticed a lot of

1218
00:42:21,418 --> 00:42:24,748
these lemon skunk strains I've got a

1219
00:42:22,978 --> 00:42:27,178
lemon skunk plant that I bred to the

1220
00:42:24,748 --> 00:42:28,948
golden go it made lemon Jeffrey and when

1221
00:42:27,179 --> 00:42:30,900
I make dabs out of the lemon skunk or

1222
00:42:28,949 --> 00:42:32,489
the lemon Jeffrey it makes my eyes

1223
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:33,479
bounce up and down a little bit for a

1224
00:42:32,489 --> 00:42:35,369
second like you're driving when you're

1225

1226
00:42:35,369 --> 00:42:38,329

1243
00:43:12,748 --> 00:43:16,168
one - should we try it on the show I

1244
00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:18,209
think we should have be silly not to

1245
00:43:16,168 --> 00:43:21,088
write there we go this one is rare

1246
00:43:18,208 --> 00:43:23,608
dankness sativa blend so this one's just

1247
00:43:21,088 --> 00:43:26,338
gonna be straight ahead Ripper I haven't

1248
00:43:23,608 --> 00:43:28,828
tried this one yet unfolding it looking

1249
00:43:26,338 --> 00:43:30,179
at it it's gonna sappy it's stickin to

1250
00:43:28,829 --> 00:43:32,009
the parchment a little more than the

1251
00:43:30,179 --> 00:43:35,099
other one did oh but it's got a nice

1252
00:43:32,009 --> 00:43:38,028
amber e color to it let's see I'm

1253
00:43:35,099 --> 00:43:38,028
smelling it off the parchment

1254
00:43:38,309 --> 00:43:45,089
it's an odd flavor kind of a lime more

1255
00:43:42,838 --> 00:43:47,639
line than what I'm used to in cannabis

1256
00:43:45,088 --> 00:43:48,989
oh that's a big dad okay we're

1257
00:43:47,639 --> 00:43:52,498
definitely gonna get a nice flavor out

1258
00:43:48,989 --> 00:43:53,938
of this so we're gonna take a DAB once

1259
00:43:52,498 --> 00:43:56,848
again guys join me hope you got a DAB

1260
00:43:53,938 --> 00:43:58,588
this is the sativa blend contains a 100%

1261
00:43:56,849 --> 00:44:01,229
organic cannabis this is whole plant

1262
00:43:58,588 --> 00:44:03,028
extracted via so a whole plant does that

1263
00:44:01,228 --> 00:44:05,668
mean that you just Chuck the cut the

1264
00:44:03,028 --> 00:44:06,710
buds off the sticks and do like fan

1265
00:44:05,668 --> 00:44:08,809
leaves and nugs all

1266
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:10,369
once I've done that at school it comes

1267
00:44:08,809 --> 00:44:11,599
out great I like to do that with my CBD

1268
00:44:10,369 --> 00:44:13,820
medicine so you get that full spectrum

1269
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:16,609
just curious with that a whole plant

1270
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:19,539
they're hinting out there all right take

1271
00:44:16,608 --> 00:44:19,539
a dab with me guys here we go

1272
00:44:25,239 --> 00:44:34,429
and that lime flavor catches me but this

1273
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:36,500
one's good

1274
00:44:34,429 --> 00:44:39,108
oh it's the Teva too because my head is

1275
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:39,469
just going well I like that I love that

1276
00:44:39,108 --> 00:44:44,000
feeling

1277
00:44:39,469 --> 00:44:46,039
ooh yeah okay definitely both of those

1278
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:49,250
were smooth both of them had a nice

1279
00:44:46,039 --> 00:44:50,659
texture both more well done there's too

1280
00:44:49,250 --> 00:44:52,670
much of a lime flavor on this rare

1281
00:44:50,659 --> 00:44:54,949
dankness one for me but it's just a

1282
00:44:52,670 --> 00:44:57,710
personal thing but overall that's a

1283
00:44:54,949 --> 00:44:59,239
great hash both of these are great the

1284
00:44:57,710 --> 00:45:00,470
only the only reason I don't give this

1285
00:44:59,239 --> 00:45:03,139
one a perfect 10 is because the lime

1286
00:45:00,469 --> 00:45:04,669
thing is not my flavor the orange

1287
00:45:03,139 --> 00:45:06,889
flavored one or the lemony flavored one

1288
00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:09,849
wins so I do give you a thumbs up on

1289
00:45:06,889 --> 00:45:13,299
both of these overall electrum extracts

1290
00:45:09,849 --> 00:45:16,490
you guys land dude shoutout I like it

1291
