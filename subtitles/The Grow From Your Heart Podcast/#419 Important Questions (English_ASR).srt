00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,940
we are smoking which one should we tell

22
00:00:49,738 --> 00:00:52,378
them about that we smoked we've been

23
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:54,419
sitting here dabbing for quite a while

24
00:00:52,378 --> 00:00:56,280
we've had it quite a smorgasbord we are

25
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,809
some spoiled brats we're pushing a

26
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,520
holiday up here in a minute we don't

27
00:00:57,808 --> 00:01:02,669
want to make anybody a prohibition land

28
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:05,609
cry or let's do we smoke some black tea

29
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:08,670
banana cush ambrosia that was the law

30
00:01:05,609 --> 00:01:11,129
tasty we did a couple of dabs of grape

31
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:13,290
piccola batter that was quite tasty

32
00:01:11,129 --> 00:01:15,688
yeah that just it just tastes like grape

33
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:17,159
Jolly Rancher and I think I by all agree

34
00:01:15,688 --> 00:01:20,039
with the grape Jolly Ranchers it's just

35
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:22,859
so good and then I think my favorite was

36
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,780
the Malibu pure Kush batter from

37
00:01:22,859 --> 00:01:27,090
apothecary farms that's got that just

38
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:29,129
straight og Tahoe Kush sort of a flavor

39
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:30,210
and we may have dabbed a couple of

40
00:01:29,129 --> 00:01:31,949
others but those are the ones that I

41
00:01:30,209 --> 00:01:34,679
know he did hit the Tropicana cookies

42
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:36,329
that was the grapefruit really fruity

43
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,860
really tropical fruit one may have been

44
00:01:36,328 --> 00:01:39,809
the last one we hit so we have been

45
00:01:37,859 --> 00:01:41,700
taking quite a few dabs over here we're

46
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:44,219

50
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:52,469

51

55
00:01:58,438 --> 00:02:01,648
this year it happens to actually be on a

56
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,450
weekend I'm sure that will continue into

57
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:05,368
Monday and Tuesday we will see some

58
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:06,960

59
00:02:05,368 --> 00:02:09,239
linger people are still in town having a

60
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:10,919
good time but we are starting early all

61
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:13,020
of the local dispensaries are having

62
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:13,859
sales and I am definitely taking

63
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:16,290
advantage of

64
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,390
sailes I've got some green dot on the

65
00:02:16,289 --> 00:02:19,199
table it is delicious I've got this this

66
00:02:18,389 --> 00:02:22,079
fortissimo

67
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:24,829
the label says it is crescendo and HSB

68
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,630
to the best of my knowledge that is hash

69
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:30,990
man hash bar is what I think that stands

70
00:02:27,629 --> 00:02:32,909
for and the package here says octane and

71
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:34,920
dumpster is the description on the

72
00:02:32,909 --> 00:02:36,509
flavor yeah I've had a lot of fun

73
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:38,519
shopping for concentrates the past few

74
00:02:36,509 --> 00:02:39,780
days everywhere has got great sales a

75
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,909
lot of the brands have been holding back

76
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,680
some of their their hit stuff for this

77
00:02:41,909 --> 00:02:45,329
week so it's been fun going out and

78
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,129
visiting dispensaries and seeing what's

79
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:48,360
available recreational and medical shops

80
00:02:47,129 --> 00:02:49,979
have a bunch of great stuff right now

81
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,590
there's been really nice shelves are

82
00:02:49,979 --> 00:02:54,269
loaded up across the state and I really

83
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:56,909
like green dots new packaging not gonna

84
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:58,590
lie it's just aesthetically pleasing it

85
00:02:56,909 --> 00:03:01,289
looks nice I really like the way they

86
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:02,489
are putting the cross or the blend

87
00:03:01,289 --> 00:03:03,569
because it's not really a cross they

88
00:03:02,489 --> 00:03:05,489
didn't breed it but they took two

89
00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:08,189
strains on this one it says that they

90
00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:10,770
put a Kim dog number four and star dog

91
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:12,689
in here together and the description is

92
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:13,770
guava juice and watermelon will dab some

93
00:03:12,689 --> 00:03:15,479
of that one in a minute that's the

94
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:17,850
copper can later always one of my

95
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:20,399
favorites on this one they describe it

96
00:03:17,849 --> 00:03:22,799
as tropical fruit cocktail this is the

97
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,080
mai tai at sunset herb and purple punch

98
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:26,459
ah some delicious concentrates Mike's

99
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,530
pace is going hey why didn't we see

100
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:33,120
Tso's none of this information was

101
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:34,620
available what a year ago years ago two

102
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,789
years ago you wouldn't you wouldn't get

103
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:38,099
this on the package and it certainly

104
00:03:35,789 --> 00:03:39,870
wasn't standard and now it's it's

105
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:41,129
becoming commonplace and I just love it

106
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:42,900
and on the back we've got the lab

107
00:03:41,129 --> 00:03:47,340
testing and all the other requirements

108
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:49,590
here so 67% on that one 69% on this one

109
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:51,269
the stuff from apothecary we've got

110
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:52,950
different type of labeling I'm loving

111
00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:54,959
all of the descriptions and all the

112
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:57,509
information what I don't like these guys

113
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,950
do it okay green dot and apothecary they

114
00:03:57,509 --> 00:04:00,329
do a really good job they give you a jar

115
00:03:58,949 --> 00:04:02,789
with concentrates in it there are some

116
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:05,580
companies that give you way too much a

117
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:07,349
box with a little feel for the Canadian

118
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:09,900
was a little wrapper with a little like

119
00:04:07,349 --> 00:04:12,060
tissue paper with a little sticker in

120
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:13,890
there with the Daisy bags

121
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:15,689
oh we're not even gonna call out any

122
00:04:13,889 --> 00:04:17,519
names it was actually told them I hated

123
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:19,350
the fuzzy bags and they they took my

124
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:22,379
advice and they stopped using good the

125
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:24,990
the jar came in a like a little pouch

126
00:04:22,379 --> 00:04:27,120
sort of like Crown Royal comes that's

127
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:31,350
what the bag the inside of the bag

128
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:33,389
this can like super fuzzy and linty and

129
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:35,280
so when you pull your dryer concentrate

130
00:04:33,389 --> 00:04:37,639
that it was like cool now that jars

131
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:40,198
fuzzy this is not at all

132
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:41,699
it looked like the jar had just stringy

133
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:43,350
hairs hanging off of it as pretty

134
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:44,759
unappealing once you opened it but I

135
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:46,530
told them I said hey I love your

136
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:48,149
absolutely love your concentrates but

137
00:04:46,529 --> 00:04:49,829
this sucks and I sent them a picture I

138
00:04:48,149 --> 00:04:51,120
was like this is what it came out of the

139
00:04:49,829 --> 00:04:52,560
package looking like this is very

140
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,389
unappealing I was like I know what's in

141
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,769
here so I know this is fire and I know

142
00:04:54,389 --> 00:04:57,180
that it should be represented better and

143
00:04:55,769 --> 00:04:58,829
they're like oh that is terrible and

144
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:00,150
they stopped doing it actually message

145
00:04:58,829 --> 00:05:01,259
me and said thank you I was polite about

146
00:05:00,149 --> 00:05:03,509
it I was like this sucks because

147
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:05,969

00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:18,839
bit to put all that out I really wanted

225
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:33,360
for 419 I that um in this episode I've

226
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:35,550
got an email from a listener it is long

227
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:38,220
there are several questions we are going

228
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:39,900
to read the intro and we will go through

229
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:41,400
the list of questions and then when I

230
00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:43,199
feel like the podcast has gotten

231
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:44,819
satisfactory and my voice burns out and

232
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,168
I've heard enough of Mike we are going

233
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:48,978
to wrap up this email and we may

234
00:07:46,168 --> 00:07:50,159
continue in a future episode a

235
00:07:48,978 --> 00:07:54,418
two-parter

236
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:57,000
maybe 419 and 421 maybe a three-parter

237
00:07:54,418 --> 00:07:59,370
maybe a 1 part it's a he's got a stack

238
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,810
of pages over here um there were images

239
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:03,418
in here that I took out and it's large

240
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:05,098
font so it may look like more message

241
00:08:03,418 --> 00:08:06,839
than it actually is now that I'm kind of

242
00:08:05,098 --> 00:08:09,959
unstacking the page multiple paragraphs

243
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:13,319
yes we got some some serious question in

244
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:14,788
story time you know yeah I was gonna say

245
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:16,319
I bet we could get more done if we quit

246
00:08:14,788 --> 00:08:19,199
talking about how many pages there are

247
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,620

248

00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:09,639
what you do and possibly more

274
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:11,379

276
00:09:11,379 --> 00:09:14,828
lot to me also then he says my main

277
00:09:13,269 --> 00:09:17,620
reason for writing is to share pictures

278
00:09:14,828 --> 00:09:19,599
from my arised row a few months back but

279
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:21,250
I also have a number of questions and

280
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,040
suggestions that I've thought of while

281
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:26,620
listening to you and the DGC so I will

282
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:28,448
dump a lot of those at the end first

283
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:31,000
the pictures and some general

284
00:09:28,448 --> 00:09:33,429
information about micro mini includes

285
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,528
several beautiful pictures of my strain

286
00:09:33,429 --> 00:09:37,659
arise you did a wonderful job we will

287
00:09:35,528 --> 00:09:38,980
talk about that more privately I can't

288
00:09:37,659 --> 00:09:40,389
share your pictures here so I don't want

289
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:42,579
to talk too much about them and abandon

290
00:09:40,389 --> 00:09:44,409
the people that are listening so let's

291
00:09:42,578 --> 00:09:47,349
keep going forward he talked about his

292
00:09:44,409 --> 00:09:50,828
grow he's growing in a 27 by 27 by 63

293
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:53,319
inch tint so this tall three feet tall

294
00:09:50,828 --> 00:09:56,708
nearly by three feet wide I'm assuming

295
00:09:53,318 --> 00:09:58,599
oh it's 3 feet by 3 feet square by 63

296
00:09:56,708 --> 00:10:00,789
what's that five feet tall Mike 63

297
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:04,120
inches five feet ish and then he's got

298
00:10:00,789 --> 00:10:06,730
an HL G 135 a horticultural lighting

299
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:10,120
group 135 LED in there that sounds like

300
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:12,009
enough white seven gallon air pots 70/30

301
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:13,179
mix of Fox farms ocean forest and

302
00:10:12,009 --> 00:10:15,730
perlite sounds like you're doing a great

303
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:18,519
job running the Fox farms trio with

304
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:19,839
recharge oh we could do more with the

305
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:21,068
nutrients we could give you a boost in

306
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,360
there but the recharge is helping you

307
00:10:21,068 --> 00:10:24,549
out we may add a few things in the

308
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:26,500
future if you listen I've mixed up so

309
00:10:24,549 --> 00:10:28,120
much Fox farms it's it's not a bad soil

310
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,289
to use if that's what you're going oh

311
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:31,480
he's got the soil that he's using the

312
00:10:29,289 --> 00:10:32,889
the Fox farms trio the three bottles for

313
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,990
feeding we could definitely do a little

314
00:10:32,889 --> 00:10:36,579
better than that I'm not sure but we can

315
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:38,169
we can move forward from there that is a

316
00:10:36,578 --> 00:10:39,159
good starter setup but we can improve

317
00:10:38,169 --> 00:10:41,828
from there you're off to a great start

318
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:43,480
he said this was my third photo run my

319
00:10:41,828 --> 00:10:46,688
first run with your genetics I've also

320
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:48,039
ran autos twice amen I hope every girl

321
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:50,409
you get a little bit better he says

322
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:52,389
overall I would rate it a solid seven

323
00:10:50,409 --> 00:10:54,698
out of ten and as long as you're

324
00:10:52,389 --> 00:10:56,438
satisfied we are happy with you he says

325
00:10:54,698 --> 00:10:58,149
it was the best crop I've had to date

326
00:10:56,438 --> 00:11:00,159
the buds looked great coming off the

327
00:10:58,149 --> 00:11:02,379
plant but the temps and humidity were a

328
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:04,419
bit out of whack during dry and cure uh

329
00:11:02,379 --> 00:11:06,338
yeah that is always a struggle he says

330
00:11:04,419 --> 00:11:07,889
he left the buds a little crispier than

331
00:11:06,339 --> 00:11:10,449
would prefer as well as lowering overall

332
00:11:07,889 --> 00:11:12,579
humidity quality from a solid eight

333
00:11:10,448 --> 00:11:15,669
overall bud quality from a solid eight

334
00:11:12,578 --> 00:11:17,289
borderline nine to a solid seven so you

335
00:11:15,669 --> 00:11:18,578
went from an eight and a half-ish down

336
00:11:17,289 --> 00:11:21,099
to a seven during the drying cure

337
00:11:18,578 --> 00:11:22,808
process so that's not a bad try yeah

338
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:24,579
what how many grows and you see threes

339
00:11:22,808 --> 00:11:27,759
is the third grouse that's not that's

340
00:11:24,578 --> 00:11:29,409
not even uh I mean you might notice it

341
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:32,680
because it's you and it's yours and you

342
00:11:29,409 --> 00:11:34,778
love it but like the friend that you

343
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:36,669
smoke out with it isn't until the

344
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:38,980
difference and as long as it's doing

345
00:11:36,669 --> 00:11:40,240
what you either go to sleep killer yeah

346
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:42,519
yeah and you're only gonna get better

347
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,049
and then an 8 out of a 10 and then you

348
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:47,078
made it a 7 with your tryin here's a

349
00:11:44,049 --> 00:11:48,669
pain in the ass and it's so tricky and

350
00:11:47,078 --> 00:11:50,739
there's so many little ins and outs and

351
00:11:48,669 --> 00:11:52,659
this guy's probably got its own job he

352
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:54,129
can't sit there all day like we do and

353
00:11:52,659 --> 00:11:55,600
stare at the jars and hope it's time to

354
00:11:54,129 --> 00:11:57,339
open them he can't do that kind of stuff

355
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,808
probably and that becomes that's when it

356
00:11:57,339 --> 00:12:00,730
really gives you know a couple of tricks

357
00:11:58,808 --> 00:12:02,198
to if you want to bring some of that

358
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:04,089
moisture content back and not have it

359
00:12:02,198 --> 00:12:05,588
taste like no we've talked a lot about

360
00:12:04,089 --> 00:12:06,939
that on the podcast the drying and

361
00:12:05,589 --> 00:12:07,930
curing episode would really help this

362
00:12:06,938 --> 00:12:09,789
guy out

363
00:12:07,929 --> 00:12:10,359
should we press pause and find out what

364
00:12:09,789 --> 00:12:11,860
number that is

365
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,480
hey Mike check on your phone and find

366
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:15,550
out what drying and cream you keep razor

367
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:17,139
I will check the thank you buddy pull

368
00:12:15,549 --> 00:12:18,428
that [ __ ] up Jamie that's my Joel Rogan

369
00:12:17,139 --> 00:12:20,829
reference all right we're gonna keep

370
00:12:18,428 --> 00:12:22,240
moving here uh it goes on it says they

371
00:12:20,828 --> 00:12:24,219
smoked well and everyone that I shared

372
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,019
with came back for more so just like

373
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:27,730
Mike said your people are gonna enjoy it

374
00:12:26,019 --> 00:12:29,589
I like to smoke while taking care of

375
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:33,278
mundane household chores and this was a

376
00:12:29,589 --> 00:12:35,079
great strain just for that rise is

377
00:12:33,278 --> 00:12:37,688
[ __ ] great for chores and I agree

378
00:12:35,078 --> 00:12:38,828
with that I keep looking at Mike

379
00:12:37,688 --> 00:12:39,818
thinking he might have the episode

380
00:12:38,828 --> 00:12:43,328
number I think I know the number but

381
00:12:39,818 --> 00:12:45,039
I'll tell you the original one was 36 oh

382
00:12:43,328 --> 00:12:46,808
no there's a much more reason there's a

383
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:49,659
much more recent one but I've got to go

384
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:52,318
to episode list and scroll down it's

385
00:12:49,659 --> 00:12:55,178
gonna be in the three 80s or three 90s

386
00:12:52,318 --> 00:12:57,428
based off of your Rhys podcast episode I

387
00:12:55,178 --> 00:12:58,990
believe I had one of the sweet Island

388
00:12:57,428 --> 00:13:00,698
skunk phenotypes alright you got some

389
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:02,350
sweet tropical flavors probably kind of

390
00:13:00,698 --> 00:13:03,248
taller not as dense of buds as some of

391
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:05,199
the other phenotypes

392
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:06,970
would have liked to fill out the net a

393
00:13:05,198 --> 00:13:08,828
little better but this was my first time

394
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:10,540
working with this cultivar so I erred on

395
00:13:08,828 --> 00:13:13,388
the side of caution and flipped a little

396
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:18,129
earlier than I should have the dry and

397
00:13:13,389 --> 00:13:19,159
cure episode is 391 391 there you go 391

398
00:13:18,129 --> 00:13:22,579
friend

399
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:23,809
drying and curing 391 you've probably

400
00:13:22,578 --> 00:13:25,878
heard it but I just want to make sure

401
00:13:23,809 --> 00:13:27,500
that you know that it is available so he

402
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:29,180
says that he flipped a little bit early

403
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:31,039
but I mean I'd rather you flip a little

404
00:13:29,179 --> 00:13:32,870
early than a little bit late early yeah

405
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:34,909
he said for my next run I've got a pack

406
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:37,310
a five pack of pineapple wine and a five

407
00:13:34,909 --> 00:13:38,299
pack of your Hellfire OG that's gonna be

408
00:13:37,309 --> 00:13:39,979
a fun grow ah

409
00:13:38,299 --> 00:13:41,929
the Hellfire OG will get a little

410
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:44,240
stretchy on you the pineapple one will

411
00:13:41,929 --> 00:13:46,128
keep up the pineapple one will stay

412
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,438
tighter during the grow but it'll make

413
00:13:46,129 --> 00:13:49,699
bigger buds that the Hellfire is gonna

414
00:13:48,438 --> 00:13:51,708
stretch a little bit and make a bunch of

415
00:13:49,698 --> 00:13:53,328
like golf ball-sized rocks on it's gonna

416
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:54,888
be a completely different type of grow

417
00:13:53,328 --> 00:13:56,539
so be prepared for two different dance

418
00:13:54,889 --> 00:13:58,278
partners it's gonna be a little bit of

419
00:13:56,539 --> 00:14:00,438
work but it will be fun I don't worry

420
00:13:58,278 --> 00:14:03,198
too much goes on and say gonna pop all

421
00:14:00,438 --> 00:14:06,169
of each looking to grow two plants in my

422
00:14:03,198 --> 00:14:08,240
new 36 by 48 inch tent and I've got a

423
00:14:06,169 --> 00:14:10,068
friend in Vermont I start plants endure

424
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,589
for he'll take any additional females I

425
00:14:10,068 --> 00:14:15,349
have left over after sexing it sounds

426
00:14:12,589 --> 00:14:16,759
like you've got a solid game plan I like

427
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:18,560
the pictures of your eyes I can't wait

428
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:21,980
to see pictures of the pineapple wine

429
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:23,869
and Hellfire og now there is more to the

430
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:26,839
email he's off to a great start

431
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:27,919
it says questions and suggestions I like

432
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:29,630
the way he broke down this message

433
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:32,028
here's where it gets its to the

434
00:14:29,629 --> 00:14:33,889
questions and suggestions I've been

435
00:14:32,028 --> 00:14:35,448
considering using some vacation time in

436
00:14:33,889 --> 00:14:38,000
the future to travel to one of the

437
00:14:35,448 --> 00:14:40,008
larger cannabis industry events events

438
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,528
similar to the Indo Expo or the D G C

439
00:14:40,009 --> 00:14:44,329
cup what are some of your favorite event

440
00:14:42,528 --> 00:14:46,220
events you've been to over the years and

441
00:14:44,328 --> 00:14:48,769
what would you suggest for someone not

442
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:50,540
in the industry being able to consume on

443
00:14:48,769 --> 00:14:53,419
premises would be one of the necessary

444
00:14:50,539 --> 00:14:55,309
caveats would it be different for

445
00:14:53,419 --> 00:14:57,379
someone that is only a consumer and not

446
00:14:55,309 --> 00:14:59,899
a grower let's talk about that one for a

447
00:14:57,379 --> 00:15:02,568
second um I would recommend the dude

448
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:04,578
grows cup it's the only event that I

449
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:07,879
would recommend at this point is the D G

450
00:15:04,578 --> 00:15:10,068
C cup stay tuned to this podcast and the

451
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:11,990
dude grows cup there may be another

452
00:15:10,068 --> 00:15:13,639
event being talked about right now it's

453
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:15,620
being talked about by those donors

454
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:17,778
that's in Colorado there are a couple

455
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:21,828
events around the country like Seattle's

456
00:15:17,778 --> 00:15:24,139
Hempfest there's a massive smoke out of

457
00:15:21,828 --> 00:15:25,688
that over the 4/20 weekend in Vancouver

458
00:15:24,139 --> 00:15:28,639
like clearly you missed it for this year

459
00:15:25,688 --> 00:15:30,919
but you might be able to set up tickets

460
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:31,649
and have a book of badass time for next

461
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:33,360
year the

462
00:15:31,649 --> 00:15:34,740
world-cup seems to be a good time some

463
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:38,159
people don't seem to have at this time

464
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:42,299
some people sends amazing consumption at

465
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:45,058
the event is pretty rare in the legal

466
00:15:42,299 --> 00:15:46,679
cannabis space right now that the whole

467
00:15:45,058 --> 00:15:48,419
world is freaked out about more than

468
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:50,159
three people getting consistent getting

469
00:15:48,419 --> 00:15:54,568
together in smoking pot at the same time

470
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:57,419
and so finding a legal space where a

471
00:15:54,568 --> 00:15:58,498
large cannabis event with a real venue

472
00:15:57,419 --> 00:16:01,378
you know where you can get some good

473
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:02,879
vending some food lots of different

474
00:16:01,379 --> 00:16:05,970
booths for different parts of the

475
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:07,379
industry all the little tchotchkes [ __ ]

476
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:09,470
that comes with an event like that just

477
00:16:07,379 --> 00:16:11,759
to have that space and consumption

478
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:13,800
there's not a lot of good options right

479
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,990
now Michigan is probably one of your

480
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:18,688
best places for that Oregon Washington

481
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:21,028
Michigan Oklahoma those are probably

482
00:16:18,688 --> 00:16:23,219
some of your best bets the places

483
00:16:21,028 --> 00:16:25,139
California they changed their rules

484
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:28,290
recently and they have really limited

485
00:16:25,139 --> 00:16:30,240
the recreational smoking at events

486
00:16:28,289 --> 00:16:32,009
Colorado basically shut it down you need

487
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,409
to have a private party sort of a thing

488
00:16:32,009 --> 00:16:36,839
the way we kind of are able to do it

489
00:16:34,409 --> 00:16:39,360
here there are very few venues that are

490
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:41,309
known to let us have consumption events

491
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,230
we have to have a private party kind of

492
00:16:41,308 --> 00:16:45,058
a thing where we invite you you have to

493
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:46,980
be on a list it is done very carefully

494
00:16:45,058 --> 00:16:50,039
to where it's not open to the public so

495
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:51,839
to speak so there are some loopholes if

496
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:54,539
you want to go to an event where you can

497
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:56,279
consume I would say come to the dude

498
00:16:54,539 --> 00:16:58,078
grows cup also pay attention for an

499
00:16:56,278 --> 00:16:59,519
event that may happen in July can't make

500
00:16:58,078 --> 00:17:00,928
any promises I'm trying to make this

501
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,428
happen we are trying to make it happen

502
00:17:00,928 --> 00:17:04,439
it's a bunch of stoners talking about it

503
00:17:02,428 --> 00:17:05,788
at this point but I'll see if I can dab

504
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:06,480
these guys into some motivation we'll

505
00:17:05,788 --> 00:17:08,788
make that happen

506
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,048
Michigan always puts on a great party

507
00:17:08,788 --> 00:17:12,720
Michigan has a great time

508
00:17:10,048 --> 00:17:14,490
a hemp fest in Seattle the Emerald cup

509
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,199
those are events where you can consume

510
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:18,359
and you can meet a lot of great people a

511
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:20,818
lot of the high times events are great

512
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:21,990
but they are in some states they aren't

513
00:17:20,818 --> 00:17:23,578
allowed to consume unless you're a

514
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:25,740
medical smoker unless you're in certain

515
00:17:23,578 --> 00:17:27,959
areas so the high times events are fun

516
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:30,120
chalice is fun those events are great

517
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:31,830
but make sure you research if you can

518
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:33,389
consume before you buy your tickets to

519
00:17:31,829 --> 00:17:36,359
go research the event before you book

520
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:38,309
yes and always keep in mind that

521
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:40,439
sometimes these events are required to

522
00:17:38,308 --> 00:17:42,569
move venues sometimes these events are

523
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:44,288
canceled at the last minute now don't

524
00:17:42,569 --> 00:17:46,450
hate on the

525
00:17:44,288 --> 00:17:48,519
promoter the organizer they do

526
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:50,230
everything that they can to make these

527
00:17:48,519 --> 00:17:52,149
events happen sometimes it's a struggle

528
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:53,589
the last minute the city says you know

529
00:17:52,148 --> 00:17:55,119
what one of our guys just threw a hissy

530
00:17:53,589 --> 00:17:57,428
fit we're gonna change your mind on you

531
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:59,168
last a minute well Uncle Bob back there

532
00:17:57,429 --> 00:18:01,120
threw a fit the whole family reunion is

533
00:17:59,169 --> 00:18:02,409
over sorry you don't get to go Mike

534
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:04,359
let's stay on track a little bit because

535
00:18:02,409 --> 00:18:06,789
this guy sent us a long email I would

536
00:18:04,359 --> 00:18:09,099
like to get through most of it this next

537
00:18:06,788 --> 00:18:10,898
paragraph says I was thinking an episode

538
00:18:09,099 --> 00:18:12,519
on what to expect when entering a grow

539
00:18:10,898 --> 00:18:14,048
contest or Throwdown would be

540
00:18:12,519 --> 00:18:16,980
informative for anyone thinking about

541
00:18:14,048 --> 00:18:20,200
dipping their toes into that water

542
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:22,870
having just come from a grow off or a

543
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:25,929
friendly community smoke grow off type

544
00:18:22,869 --> 00:18:29,379
of event I feel a lot of what

545
00:18:25,929 --> 00:18:31,480
contributed to judging there was mostly

546
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:33,730
flavor when you have got a group of

547
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:36,669
people judging an amount of product

548
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:38,980
which is there were 50 entries if I had

549
00:18:36,669 --> 00:18:40,090
you smoke one ripoff of 50 entries would

550
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:43,149
you be able to tell me the difference

551
00:18:40,089 --> 00:18:44,439
after number 22 it's after a certain

552
00:18:43,148 --> 00:18:47,259
point you're just baked and it's all

553
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:50,409
flavor is the erection so what I think

554
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:52,538
won this Cup was mostly based on flavor

555
00:18:50,409 --> 00:18:54,340
yes it's gotta burn properly I guess

556
00:18:52,538 --> 00:18:56,740
it's gonna look good in the jar it's got

557
00:18:54,339 --> 00:18:58,629
to have all the proper characteristics

558
00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:00,970
when you're in a competition they all

559
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:03,278
bring tri cones they all have bag appeal

560
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:05,649
they're all trimmed properly they're all

561
00:19:03,278 --> 00:19:08,169
dried and cured beautifully so what it's

562
00:19:05,648 --> 00:19:10,538
just the very subtle nuances if you've

563
00:19:08,169 --> 00:19:12,278
got those very beautiful flavors if it

564
00:19:10,538 --> 00:19:14,710
burns perfectly those are the things

565
00:19:12,278 --> 00:19:16,929
it's got to be 100% perfection so he

566
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:18,730
said what to expect when entering is

567
00:19:16,929 --> 00:19:21,340
anyone thinking about dipping their toes

568
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:23,200
in you've got to do everything perfectly

569
00:19:21,339 --> 00:19:25,599
trim it to where it looks like it is on

570
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:28,028
the cover of a magazine that I can't be

571
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:29,859
stressed enough trim your [ __ ] yeah

572
00:19:28,028 --> 00:19:31,569
ugly herb I look right past it I go they

573
00:19:29,859 --> 00:19:32,859
were too lazy to trim it properly they

574
00:19:31,569 --> 00:19:34,599
probably didn't do the rest of the

575
00:19:32,859 --> 00:19:35,558
process properly it probably tastes like

576
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:36,879
[ __ ] because there's a lot of

577
00:19:35,558 --> 00:19:39,069
chlorophyll in it because look at all

578
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:42,039
that leaf material it's a turn-off right

579
00:19:39,069 --> 00:19:44,168
away so trim it properly dry it and cure

580
00:19:42,038 --> 00:19:45,908
it a lot of product looked really good

581
00:19:44,169 --> 00:19:47,620
you went to smoke it it was too damp it

582
00:19:45,909 --> 00:19:49,090
was too dry it just wasn't right you

583
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:50,259
could tell it was quick dried it just

584
00:19:49,089 --> 00:19:55,240
burned up a little bit weird

585
00:19:50,259 --> 00:19:57,788
um flush flush before harvest flushing

586
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:59,589
is free please flush your plants it's

587
00:19:57,788 --> 00:20:02,499
so essential if you're gonna try to

588
00:19:59,589 --> 00:20:04,720
compete you have to flush your yes you

589
00:20:02,499 --> 00:20:07,089
have when you're smoking 10 or 15

590
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:09,729
strains in a row and number eight tastes

591
00:20:07,089 --> 00:20:11,528
like [ __ ] worm castings it ain't

592
00:20:09,729 --> 00:20:13,269
gonna win you can tell like I said

593
00:20:11,528 --> 00:20:14,858
earlier we're going for flavor a lot of

594
00:20:13,269 --> 00:20:17,048
it is flavor once you've smoked 50

595
00:20:14,858 --> 00:20:18,699
samples you don't get much higher you're

596
00:20:17,048 --> 00:20:20,618
already peaked out your lungs are burnt

597
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:22,720
out it's got to stand out and flavor is

598
00:20:20,618 --> 00:20:24,220
what's going to make it do it unless you

599
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,499
hit one that really just puts you on

600
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:27,639
your ass then you go oh that one might

601
00:20:26,499 --> 00:20:29,108
be special then you're gonna have to

602
00:20:27,638 --> 00:20:31,118
taste that one again in a minute to see

603
00:20:29,108 --> 00:20:32,589
is it taste really good is it potent

604
00:20:31,118 --> 00:20:34,118
because there are a lot of great things

605
00:20:32,589 --> 00:20:35,199
in there and the ones that taste best

606
00:20:34,118 --> 00:20:38,558
are the ones you're gonna you're gonna

607
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:41,080
remember the most an fu you body is so

608
00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:43,569
saturated I watch people there their

609
00:20:41,079 --> 00:20:45,220
eyes were red like we smoked from four

610
00:20:43,569 --> 00:20:47,048
o'clock until 11 o'clock at night in

611
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:49,239
that place judging these products like

612
00:20:47,048 --> 00:20:52,148
we people were lit so if you're gonna

613
00:20:49,239 --> 00:20:53,769
enter make it think about it like you

614
00:20:52,148 --> 00:20:56,048
are putting it under a microscope and

615
00:20:53,769 --> 00:20:57,788
you were handing it to the best smokers

616
00:20:56,048 --> 00:20:59,679
and growers on the planet because it is

617
00:20:57,788 --> 00:21:01,509
going to be scrutinized it is going to

618
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:03,369
be judged that's the point you want it

619
00:21:01,509 --> 00:21:03,759
judged make sure you didn't do anything

620
00:21:03,368 --> 00:21:06,368
wrong

621
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:09,098
ah and don't be afraid to lose because

622
00:21:06,368 --> 00:21:10,689
everybody else entered the same way the

623
00:21:09,098 --> 00:21:13,298
same attitude that you did they brought

624
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:16,558
their best so just be proud and have fun

625
00:21:13,298 --> 00:21:18,608
with everybody and enjoy the competition

626
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:20,589
it's one of the things you got to

627
00:21:18,608 --> 00:21:21,819
remember is you're not doing this just

628
00:21:20,589 --> 00:21:23,618
for the troffer you do it to have fun

629
00:21:21,819 --> 00:21:25,749
yeah that's a big part of ever the

630
00:21:23,618 --> 00:21:29,079
passion just to just to be a part of it

631
00:21:25,749 --> 00:21:31,899
the the just the concept of the judge

632
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:34,509
having a day or three days to smoke

633
00:21:31,898 --> 00:21:37,118
through you know all those are examples

634
00:21:34,509 --> 00:21:38,798
and all those concentrated samples like

635
00:21:37,118 --> 00:21:41,019
I remember reading stuff about this in

636
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:43,269
high times back 15-20 years when they

637
00:21:41,019 --> 00:21:44,769
talk about the cop in Amsterdam and just

638
00:21:43,269 --> 00:21:47,108
how overwhelming it would be for the

639
00:21:44,769 --> 00:21:49,108
judges to just like they have [ __ ]

640
00:21:47,108 --> 00:21:51,489
homework notebooks full of [ __ ] and

641
00:21:49,108 --> 00:21:53,710
trying to keep the samples straight and

642
00:21:51,489 --> 00:21:55,058
it's a lot of work on the judges folks

643
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:56,829
you got to remember that piece here's

644
00:21:55,058 --> 00:21:58,569
one more piece well actually what's fun

645
00:21:56,829 --> 00:22:00,249
about the dude grows Cup is everybody's

646
00:21:58,569 --> 00:22:02,710
a judge everybody that enters get fired

647
00:22:00,249 --> 00:22:04,598
gets five tokens and then once you smoke

648
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:05,829
votes they get five votes you can put

649
00:22:04,598 --> 00:22:07,298
those wherever you want yeah I thought

650
00:22:05,829 --> 00:22:08,558
that was kind of cool so everybody that

651
00:22:07,298 --> 00:22:10,329
paid money to have a ticket was

652
00:22:08,558 --> 00:22:11,799
considered a judge so we all got to try

653
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:13,449
it another thing I want

654
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:14,919
add on to this and this will be my last

655
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:17,380
part about this about if you're trying

656
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:19,779
to enter don't enter a big old giant

657
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:22,510
donkey dick bud and don't enter a bunch

658
00:22:19,779 --> 00:22:24,789
of crappy [ __ ] kibble enter some

659
00:22:22,509 --> 00:22:28,269
decent size bag of peel buds most places

660
00:22:24,789 --> 00:22:31,269
want approximately an ounce give us like

661
00:22:28,269 --> 00:22:33,460
a few nice nuggets don't give us one fat

662
00:22:31,269 --> 00:22:36,279
ounce bud don't give us a bunch of shake

663
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:38,950
and crap show us give us a bag it can be

664
00:22:36,279 --> 00:22:41,079
divided up amongst like 28 judges if you

665
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:42,490
got an ounce give me like 20 grand grand

666
00:22:41,079 --> 00:22:46,449
buzz was he awesome

667
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:47,980
like that a crammed size note is what

668
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:50,319
you're looking for yeah so that we can

669
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:51,549
we can share it we can all enjoy it and

670
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:53,169
look at it and everybody can get a

671
00:22:51,549 --> 00:22:55,210
little visual of it we can see what the

672
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:57,220
texture the colors the aroma is the bag

673
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:59,740
appeal all of that matters to me because

674
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:02,079
if you've got 22 different jars of Bud

675
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:04,509
the visual is a big part of it and like

676
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:05,649
I said once we've smoked 20 or 30 jars I

677
00:23:04,509 --> 00:23:08,019
don't look there

678
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:09,700
it's then visual is gonna matter because

679
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:11,799
the potency doesn't matter anymore the

680
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:13,720
visual the aroma and the taste that's

681
00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:15,220
what's gonna get me yep alright so I've

682
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:16,779
rambled along about bound for a long

683
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:18,400
time let's move to the next question

684
00:23:16,779 --> 00:23:19,839
here I really like this email this is a

685
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,300
whole episode worth of questions I like

686
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:24,789
it how often should my exhaust fan kick

687
00:23:22,299 --> 00:23:27,279
on I run a carbon filter attached to my

688
00:23:24,789 --> 00:23:29,109
fan in the tent for the previous setup

689
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:30,519
and I felt like it the smell suffered

690
00:23:29,109 --> 00:23:32,889
due to the constant scrubbing I've

691
00:23:30,519 --> 00:23:34,839
configured my setup to where the fan and

692
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:37,390
the filter are outside the tent but now

693
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:39,819
wondering how often I should be running

694
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:42,190
refreshing my air in my tent I have it

695
00:23:39,819 --> 00:23:47,079
have the setup currently running 15

696
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:48,400
minutes every four hours um the first

697
00:23:47,079 --> 00:23:51,220
thing that caught my attention Mike

698
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:53,170
nodded at me also the carbon filter did

699
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:55,480
not mess with the I think he's saying

700
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:56,860
that it messed with the aroma the smell

701
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:58,870
suffered so I think he's saying a mess

702
00:23:56,859 --> 00:24:00,669
with the aroma of the final product it

703
00:23:58,869 --> 00:24:02,199
shouldn't yeah that's not if that's not

704
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:03,910
possible that's not a thing that carbon

705
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,500
filter did not did not do they like it's

706
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:08,140
not sucking terpenes out of the plan

707
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:11,049
right right yeah that is not a thing so

708
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:13,720
the other red the first red flag for me

709
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:16,149
was the hey that's not a thing and

710
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:17,589
what's her humanity he's doing right

711
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:20,380
that's what I was going to say he's

712
00:24:17,589 --> 00:24:22,179
running it uh every 15 minutes or 15

713
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:24,070
minutes for every four hours I would do

714
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:25,720
it a little more frequently yeah

715
00:24:24,069 --> 00:24:27,519
probably once every hour but I

716
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:29,289
just pay attention to the humidity what

717
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:31,690
is it like in there do you have a way to

718
00:24:29,289 --> 00:24:33,430
monitor the humidity you're going to get

719
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:35,350
a spike when the lights go off you've

720
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:37,390
got all that water in the air because

721
00:24:35,349 --> 00:24:39,099
the lights have been creating heat all

722
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:41,920
the water is evaporated it's in the air

723
00:24:39,099 --> 00:24:43,509
you're going to turn off the lights your

724
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,710
humidity is going to spike and then it's

725
00:24:43,509 --> 00:24:46,480
going to drop you're gonna get a few

726
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:48,880
movements and then when the lights come

727
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:52,450
back on it's gonna do weird things also

728
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:54,130
so how are you able to monitor that when

729
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:56,549
you can see what's happening in there

730
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:59,830
you'll know better how to adjust your

731
00:24:56,549 --> 00:25:01,569
your exhaust you may need a dehumidifier

732
00:24:59,829 --> 00:25:04,119
also if you've got too much humidity in

733
00:25:01,569 --> 00:25:06,579
there but I would get something that can

734
00:25:04,119 --> 00:25:09,099
monitor the VPP I would grab something

735
00:25:06,579 --> 00:25:10,720
like a PL grill monitor and put that in

736
00:25:09,099 --> 00:25:12,369
there and that way you can check on your

737
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,559
phone at any time you can see what the

738
00:25:12,369 --> 00:25:16,779
VPD of that grow room is you can see

739
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:19,869
when it is necessary to recycle the air

740
00:25:16,779 --> 00:25:22,149
in that tent like I would definitely go

741
00:25:19,869 --> 00:25:24,429
like 15 minutes an hour yeah 15 minutes

742
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:25,840
every hour at least refresh the air at

743
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:28,269
least refresh it that's going to

744
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:29,589
increase your co2 it's going to just

745
00:25:28,269 --> 00:25:32,619
refresh the air it's going to help with

746
00:25:29,589 --> 00:25:34,809
your humidity I think one time every

747
00:25:32,619 --> 00:25:36,219
hour maybe just 10 minutes honestly

748
00:25:34,809 --> 00:25:38,349
there's no reason to turn it off I think

749
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:40,839
it was just less to say most of the

750
00:25:38,349 --> 00:25:45,519
setups I've helped design and build for

751
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:48,819
in-home production just had an on and

752
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:50,559
off and they just ran forever yeah the

753
00:25:48,819 --> 00:25:52,240
way I do mine so I run a differ

754
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:54,039
different couple of setups when I have

755
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,500
tints the way that I have a tent set up

756
00:25:54,039 --> 00:25:58,509
right now I've got a carbon filter it is

757
00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:00,460
sitting on a cinder block in the corner

758
00:25:58,509 --> 00:26:02,529
because it is honestly too heavy to hang

759
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:04,360
in that room I would rather hang it in

760
00:26:02,529 --> 00:26:06,069
the tent but it won't hang it's heavy so

761
00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:08,409
it is on a cinder block and it is

762
00:26:06,069 --> 00:26:10,509
upright then the duct comes off of that

763
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:12,130
it goes over the light which is a light

764
00:26:10,509 --> 00:26:14,349
hood with glass so that is sealed up

765
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:17,170
then it goes up to an exhaust fan the

766
00:26:14,349 --> 00:26:19,089
exhaust sits on top of the hut outside

767
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:20,710
of the hut and it sucks the air through

768
00:26:19,089 --> 00:26:23,439
the Carson filter sitting right there

769
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:25,210
right sorry yeah pulling so I'm blowing

770
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:27,370
the air through the carbon filter over

771
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:29,140
the light and then up out of the blower

772
00:26:27,369 --> 00:26:31,349
out of the tent and it blows it into the

773
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:34,360
room and that room has enough

774
00:26:31,349 --> 00:26:36,369
circulation of air and what's the room

775
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:37,359
central air cooling in that room to

776
00:26:36,369 --> 00:26:38,739
where I don't have to worry about it

777
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:39,250
getting stale in there I just leave that

778
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:41,559
room open

779
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:43,630
works with the rest of the house so what

780
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:45,339
works is when I zip it up all those

781
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:47,110
passive ducks at the bottom of the tent

782
00:26:45,339 --> 00:26:49,179
most of the grow hint grow huts and grow

783
00:26:47,109 --> 00:26:52,299
tents have passive vents at the bottom

784
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:53,710
so if I just unbell crow those I pull in

785
00:26:52,299 --> 00:26:55,029
enough fresh air through the bottom

786
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:56,620
right there and it just sucks all my

787
00:26:55,029 --> 00:26:59,139
stale air right out of that tent and

788
00:26:56,619 --> 00:27:00,939
I've got a six-inch blower on a five by

789
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:02,860
five tent and when I zip it up it caves

790
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:04,240
in it doesn't like crush in but you can

791
00:27:02,859 --> 00:27:06,579
tell it sucks in pretty well so I'm

792
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,769
getting plenty of airflow by the size of

793
00:27:06,579 --> 00:27:10,659
your tent if you've got a big enough fan

794
00:27:08,769 --> 00:27:12,009
just to you don't want it to cave in you

795
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:13,570
want to see it like kind of billow in

796
00:27:12,009 --> 00:27:14,769
just a little bit it's not gonna crush

797
00:27:13,569 --> 00:27:16,359
but you can tell it's creating some

798
00:27:14,769 --> 00:27:18,519
pressure you know that you were

799
00:27:16,359 --> 00:27:19,659
evacuating out enough air and replacing

800
00:27:18,519 --> 00:27:22,480
enough air to where it's not getting

801
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:24,279
stale and that carbon filter is not

802
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:26,110
going to deplete the smell of your

803
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:28,329
cannabis I would put that back in the

804
00:27:26,109 --> 00:27:30,009
tent is what I would do all right so I

805
00:27:28,329 --> 00:27:32,619
want to move into the next paragraph

806
00:27:30,009 --> 00:27:34,210
where are we I'm right here he says for

807

consider putting a select your own

809
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:39,640
donation amount button I was fully

810
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:41,619
planning on donating 10 bucks a month

811
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:44,680
when I first signed up but I was limited

812
00:27:41,619 --> 00:27:47,589
to the preset options of 427 cent etc

813
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:49,450
and I chose 7/10 instead of the full $10

814
00:27:47,589 --> 00:27:51,339
as I had planned oh I just ripped myself

815
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:53,440
off for a good two dollars and ninety

816
00:27:51,339 --> 00:27:55,299
cents yeah he said you might be limiting

817
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,340
what you bring in monthly due to your

818
00:27:55,299 --> 00:27:59,379
limited donation options it's possible

819
00:27:57,339 --> 00:28:00,789
it's always possible that patreon does

820
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:03,370
not support this option as well you know

821
00:28:00,789 --> 00:28:05,139
I don't remember seeing the ad your own

822
00:28:03,369 --> 00:28:06,939
thing button so I may want to add a

823
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:09,160
dollar and ten bucks I may want to go

824
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:10,330
add a few more tiers so that people can

825
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:12,190
help out at different levels I

826
00:28:10,329 --> 00:28:14,289
appreciate that that may be really good

827
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:15,490
and they may be a million dollar tip

828
00:28:14,289 --> 00:28:17,200
right there you never know in the long

829
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:20,890
run if it's a million dollars if we need

830
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:23,170
to start talking about pay well anyway

831
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:24,970
we're gonna move forth let's see there's

832
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:26,830
one there's a couple more things on here

833
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:28,960
but I think we can cover it all in this

834
00:28:26,829 --> 00:28:32,309
one this next paragraph is going to be

835
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:35,200
great it says let's talk about bagsied I

836
00:28:32,309 --> 00:28:37,240
have on rare occasions ran across seeded

837
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:40,059
buds from the Medical dispensaries in my

838
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:41,950
area yes that happens should I even

839
00:28:40,059 --> 00:28:43,779
consider growing these out my main

840
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:45,130
concern is that the pollen would have

841
00:28:43,779 --> 00:28:47,559
potentially been from a hermaphrodite

842
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:49,750
leading to these seeds too similarly her

843
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:52,700
can I be sure that the seed is a

844
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:54,019
representative of what was in the bag

845
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:56,028
my main concern is that it was

846
00:28:54,019 --> 00:28:58,970
cross-pollinated leading to potentially

847
00:28:56,028 --> 00:29:00,558
unstable or unpredictable genetics micro

848
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:02,690
space is limited and this seems like a

849
00:29:00,558 --> 00:29:07,658
bit of a gamble your thoughts either way

850
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:10,210
would be appreciated this is a fun one

851
00:29:07,659 --> 00:29:13,669
those seeds could have come from

852
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:15,259
anywhere it could have been a it wasn't

853
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:18,859
a male plant chances are pretty good

854
00:29:15,259 --> 00:29:20,720
that the herb you've got in the bag is

855
00:29:18,858 --> 00:29:23,178
at least half the genetics of those

856
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:25,190
seeds but that's really all you got

857
00:29:23,179 --> 00:29:26,570
right right so the the herb that you

858
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:28,609
bought the label if it says you're Lu

859
00:29:26,569 --> 00:29:30,528
dream or whatever you got yes that seed

860
00:29:28,608 --> 00:29:33,589
is going to be from a blue dream female

861
00:29:30,528 --> 00:29:35,269
but at least 50% but where that the male

862
00:29:33,589 --> 00:29:37,009
part came from it wasn't a male it

863
00:29:35,269 --> 00:29:38,720
probably was not a male most the

864
00:29:37,009 --> 00:29:40,278
dispensary growers we pull a male way

865
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,419
before that we don't even have seeds in

866
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:42,739
the girl most of the time it's all

867
00:29:41,419 --> 00:29:44,600
clones that have been passed around for

868
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:46,220
a long time so there's no opportunity

869
00:29:44,599 --> 00:29:47,719
for a male it was probably another plant

870
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:49,999
that hermaphrodite it or what is

871
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:52,129
possible and this does happen when a

872
00:29:49,999 --> 00:29:53,960
plant becomes too stressed or it has a

873
00:29:52,128 --> 00:29:55,638
light leak if one section of the plant

874
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:57,108
is exposed to light quite often in a

875
00:29:55,638 --> 00:29:58,878
commercial environment there'd be a

876
00:29:57,108 --> 00:30:00,378
doorway right by the doorway or the two

877
00:29:58,878 --> 00:30:02,028
doors closed there's that little little

878
00:30:00,378 --> 00:30:03,980
tiny gap you'll get a little section of

879
00:30:02,028 --> 00:30:05,659
seeded buds right there and the plants

880
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:07,099
don't hum from it but they just stress

881
00:30:05,659 --> 00:30:08,989
seed they'll make a couple of seeds in

882
00:30:07,099 --> 00:30:11,089
the middle so you may have seeds like

883
00:30:08,989 --> 00:30:12,739
that it is hard to predict what you've

884
00:30:11,089 --> 00:30:14,569
got most likely it is a stress seed

885
00:30:12,739 --> 00:30:16,190
caused by a light leak in a commercial

886
00:30:14,569 --> 00:30:19,970
facility maybe they over fed it and it's

887
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:22,009
stressed if you grow that you could have

888
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:24,019
the most amazing [ __ ] on the planet or

889
00:30:22,009 --> 00:30:27,169
you could have the biggest problem on

890
00:30:24,019 --> 00:30:29,690
the planet it is hard to predict right

891
00:30:27,169 --> 00:30:31,820
some some her or some little mutant sees

892
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:34,609
come out like Wolverine and some come

893
00:30:31,819 --> 00:30:37,069
out like sloth Kim 91 and all of the

894
00:30:34,608 --> 00:30:39,378
chem dog strains were an accident Girl

895
00:30:37,069 --> 00:30:40,009
Scout cookies in my theory was an

896
00:30:39,378 --> 00:30:42,558
accident

897
00:30:40,009 --> 00:30:44,599
gorilla glue number four was an accident

898
00:30:42,558 --> 00:30:46,999
golden goat was an accident

899
00:30:44,599 --> 00:30:49,009
many of the super popular crosses that

900
00:30:46,999 --> 00:30:50,480
we have got that we were using it were

901
00:30:49,009 --> 00:30:52,700
really popular for a while were

902
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:55,339
accidents those seeds that are in that

903
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:56,778
bag are accidents sometimes when you

904
00:30:55,339 --> 00:30:58,009
look back at genetics of some of the

905
00:30:56,778 --> 00:30:59,898
really popular if you look back the

906
00:30:58,009 --> 00:31:01,519
lineage of really popular genetics you

907
00:30:59,898 --> 00:31:04,139
see in the family tree it will say

908
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:05,460
unknown bagsied and a lot of them

909
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:06,870
cuz somebody just doesn't know what that

910
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:08,579
was and back in the day we didn't have

911
00:31:06,869 --> 00:31:09,899
seed banks and breeders to order a [ __ ]

912
00:31:08,579 --> 00:31:11,759
ton of seeds from so if you've got a

913
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:13,769
killer seed you grew it you want to see

914
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:15,240
what it was and a lot of people started

915
00:31:13,769 --> 00:31:18,119
a lot of good breeding projects with

916
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:19,410
unknown bag seed so you may have it's

917
00:31:18,119 --> 00:31:20,699
kind of like a you've got a pack of

918
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:24,930
baseball cards right there

919
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:27,059
you could have a this is where the

920
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:28,529
analogy falls apart cuz the water sports

921
00:31:27,059 --> 00:31:30,809
enough to name someone current or you

922
00:31:28,529 --> 00:31:32,849
could have the other one you can have a

923
00:31:30,809 --> 00:31:34,589
Mickey Mantle or you could have a

924
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:36,899
[ __ ] yeah exactly

925
00:31:34,589 --> 00:31:41,129
mm-hmm yep exactly you can have the gum

926
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:45,720
it's uh yeah who knows which one you've

927
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:47,850
got um all of the chem dog lineage that

928
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:50,250
all comes from back seed that came from

929
00:31:47,849 --> 00:31:53,429
if you have not already if you are a

930
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:54,839
cannabis aficionado a consumer if you

931
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:56,970
were into cannabis and you want to be

932
00:31:54,839 --> 00:31:57,449
part of the community piece of Canada

933
00:31:56,970 --> 00:31:59,850
history

934
00:31:57,450 --> 00:32:01,500
you need to read chem dog and the legend

935
00:31:59,849 --> 00:32:02,789
of the thirteen beans that is really

936
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:04,619
important that you read that all of

937
00:32:02,789 --> 00:32:06,089
those seeds were bagged seed and that is

938
00:32:04,619 --> 00:32:07,859
where the further generations of chem

939
00:32:06,089 --> 00:32:11,939
dog from the dog button came with half

940
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:15,479
the good weed of like the 2005 to 2010

941
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:19,019
came from that [ __ ] 91 yeah gone there

942
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:20,759
91 on Vincey see how that works but uh

943
00:32:19,019 --> 00:32:22,619
yeah so well you who knows what you've

944
00:32:20,759 --> 00:32:24,809
got there that's me being [ __ ] old I

945
00:32:22,619 --> 00:32:26,369
never want to go back that far if it's

946
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:28,109
part of deadhead culture and cannabis

947
00:32:26,369 --> 00:32:31,259
culture so it collides into my favorite

948
00:32:28,109 --> 00:32:33,029
worlds if you have got extra space grow

949
00:32:31,259 --> 00:32:35,519
that out if you don't have extra space

950
00:32:33,029 --> 00:32:36,930
maybe you don't grow it out maybe save

951
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:39,059
that or pass it on to a friend that's

952
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:41,190
got extra space I'm not sure what you've

953
00:32:39,059 --> 00:32:42,599
got when you grow it sprout the seed get

954
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:44,309
it big enough to take a clone get a

955
00:32:42,599 --> 00:32:45,809
clone of it either flower out that

956
00:32:44,309 --> 00:32:47,519
original seedling or flower out the

957
00:32:45,809 --> 00:32:49,230
clone and see what you've got if it's

958
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:50,639
amazing you've got a keeper of it back

959
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:52,380
there with that clone or that original

960
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,700
plant if it's crap then you've got

961
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:55,230
another crap plant that you need to

962
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:56,460
throw away but the only way to really

963
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:57,960
find out is to grow it

964
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:59,880
the world needs snicklefritz soon buddy

965
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:01,440
that's that's the truth you could have

966
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,760
you could have the next Mickey Mantle

967
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,190
card right there or you could have the

968
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:06,210
gum from the package it's hard to guess

969
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:08,400
it's hard to predict

970
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:10,019
um what strain did it come from it

971
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,850
probably came from quality bud because

972
00:33:10,019 --> 00:33:13,079
you bought it there's probably the best

973
00:33:11,849 --> 00:33:15,750
on the Shelf that day they got your

974
00:33:13,079 --> 00:33:17,849
attention so you may get that you may

975
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:20,640
get nothing like most of this

976
00:33:17,849 --> 00:33:24,240
deeds I get in dispensary or are pretty

977
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:25,679
clearly stress yeah those light leaks

978
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,419
are a [ __ ] and you cannot make

979
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:30,419
owners understand simple [ __ ] like a

980
00:33:27,419 --> 00:33:31,830
pinhole can ruin a room I think our

981
00:33:30,419 --> 00:33:35,669
friend uncle Joey would say take a

982
00:33:31,829 --> 00:33:36,869
chance Columbus did and I would say grow

983
00:33:35,669 --> 00:33:38,910
because I'm curious what's in there I'd

984
00:33:36,869 --> 00:33:40,769
want to know especially it's for our own

985
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:42,360
bag see - it's just hard with the number

986
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:44,250
of limitations I was gonna say you're

987
00:33:42,359 --> 00:33:47,428
limited on space which are probably also

988
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:49,109
limited on genetic availability I don't

989
00:33:47,429 --> 00:33:51,269
know what you're growing for if you're

990
00:33:49,109 --> 00:33:52,500
growing for your own personal medicine

991
00:33:51,269 --> 00:33:54,298
and you've got something that works

992
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:56,519
stick to it don't change it if it ain't

993
00:33:54,298 --> 00:33:58,200
broke don't fix it but if you are

994
00:33:56,519 --> 00:34:00,480
growing and it is going to the market

995
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:02,220
and this is becoming profitable if you

996
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:04,019
grow that seed you've got something

997
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:05,850
nobody else has it is unique you've

998
00:34:04,019 --> 00:34:08,250
instantly set yourself apart from the

999
00:34:05,849 --> 00:34:09,839
market so if you've got the new thing

1000
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:12,000
whatever you want to call it ah

1001
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:13,559
let's make up a name I don't know the

1002
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,820
[ __ ] red gold and green Rasta flag

1003
00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:16,739
that's what's right in front of me so it

1004
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:18,480
was really easy if you're the only one

1005
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:19,709
with that and it's the new fire in town

1006
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,539
everyone's gonna be talking about the

1007
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:22,800
red golden-green Rasta flag strain and

1008
00:34:21,539 --> 00:34:24,960
you're the only one with it they gotta

1009
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:27,419
go to you to get that and that's always

1010
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:30,480
helpful if that is your approach to

1011
00:34:27,418 --> 00:34:32,969
cannabis so that's my insight into that

1012
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:35,550
one I I can't really give you any better

1013
00:34:32,969 --> 00:34:37,378
advice on what's in that seed because it

1014
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:40,619
is like you said unpredictable

1015
00:34:37,378 --> 00:34:42,179
potentially unstable yes also possibly

1016
00:34:40,619 --> 00:34:45,240
the [ __ ] champ you can have Michael

1017
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:46,648
Jordan in there and you never know so

1018
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:48,839
the email keeps going he says below are

1019
00:34:46,648 --> 00:34:50,608
a couple of pictures of a prototype cure

1020
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:52,950
jar with the lid built in I've been

1021
00:34:50,608 --> 00:34:54,509
working on actually I've seen these from

1022
00:34:52,949 --> 00:34:56,398
another person I'm not sure if that's

1023
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:58,200
you but I've gotten some of these and

1024
00:34:56,398 --> 00:34:59,940
they work very well it's a mason jar

1025
00:34:58,199 --> 00:35:00,809
with a hygrometer lid inside of it so

1026
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:02,220
you can yes

1027
00:35:00,809 --> 00:35:03,989
I've gotten some of those from another

1028
00:35:02,219 --> 00:35:06,629
person I don't think that that was you

1029
00:35:03,989 --> 00:35:08,729
I'm using them they work marvelously

1030
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:10,500
they tell you exactly the temperature

1031
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:12,240
and humidity inside that jar so you can

1032
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:13,739
see how moist or how dry your product is

1033
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:15,179
you know what to crack it open you know

1034
00:35:13,739 --> 00:35:15,868
how long to leave it open it is

1035
00:35:15,179 --> 00:35:17,399
beautiful

1036
00:35:15,869 --> 00:35:19,650
if you're making those along with the

1037
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:21,050
other person I encourage you to keep

1038
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:23,369
going that's a great product

1039
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:26,280
my voice is burning out hold on here we

1040
00:35:23,369 --> 00:35:27,510
go submit a patent there you go the

1041
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:29,100
patent race is on because I know two

1042
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:30,330
people making this product now so when

1043
00:35:29,099 --> 00:35:31,558
you guys has to get a patent and then

1044
00:35:30,329 --> 00:35:32,699
one of you has to get a season

1045
00:35:31,559 --> 00:35:34,680
sis let her go no I'm just kidding

1046
00:35:32,699 --> 00:35:36,298
become friends and then make a really

1047
00:35:34,679 --> 00:35:38,358
great car because you're the first race

1048
00:35:36,298 --> 00:35:39,869
does the [ __ ] thirty gallon buckets

1049
00:35:38,358 --> 00:35:41,429
there you go

1050
00:35:39,869 --> 00:35:43,499
the five-gallon buckets with hygrometer

1051
00:35:41,429 --> 00:35:45,568
lids Lowe's buckets with hygrometer lids

1052
00:35:43,498 --> 00:35:47,399
to grow the thirty gal plastic Popoff

1053
00:35:45,568 --> 00:35:48,958
lids the sweater buckets oh yeah those

1054
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:50,910
are much easier to work with do [ __ ]

1055
00:35:48,958 --> 00:35:52,498
been in those five-gallon lids off my

1056
00:35:50,909 --> 00:35:53,728
knuckles hurt just thinking about yeah I

1057
00:35:52,498 --> 00:35:54,929

1058
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:56,879
too many buckets we're gonna continue

1059
00:35:54,929 --> 00:35:58,379

1060
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,059
of this email goes like this I

1061
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:02,189

product oh he's talking about the the

1066
00:36:07,409 --> 00:36:10,858
jars you talk tomorrow with a hydrometer

1067
00:36:09,028 --> 00:36:14,219
the hydrometer has a notch that keeps it

1068
00:36:10,858 --> 00:36:16,170
pulled right to the lid um the main the

1069
00:36:14,219 --> 00:36:17,249
margin for error for one's picture for

1070

the ones picture is between three and

1071
00:36:17,248 --> 00:36:20,368
five percent that is pretty cool are you

1072
00:36:18,958 --> 00:36:22,528
aware of any similar products yes

1073
00:36:20,369 --> 00:36:24,630
unfortunately I'm more of the exact same

1074
00:36:22,528 --> 00:36:26,489
product I got some from a friend at the

1075

track because they're needed so I do

1077
00:36:28,018 --> 00:36:31,379
encourage you to continue working with

1078
00:36:29,608 --> 00:36:33,509
these I don't stop because someone else

1079
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:35,130
