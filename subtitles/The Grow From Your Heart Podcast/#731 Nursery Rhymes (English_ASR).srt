this show super long at the start let's

68
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,160

69
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:50,159
message that came from our patreon page

70
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:52,000

00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:58,400
as well my message from my buddy tonto

74
00:02:55,759 --> 00:03:00,318
goes a lot like this it says hey ross to

75
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,319
jeff i have a couple of questions that i

76
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:04,079
think might be good for the show let's

77
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:06,079
start with this one this is a great spot

78
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,000
to start it says i have a bunch of

79
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,840
medical conditions they make gardening a

80
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,719
struggle during certain parts of the

81
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,840
year

82
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:16,080
my ptsd depression and back issues make

83
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,039
a lovely cocktail of reasons not to get

84
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,680
my gardening work done i understand that

85
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:23,919
with a lot of uh ptsd depression back

86
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,680
issues that's three solid excuses to not

87
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:27,679
get out of bed not get off the couch not

88
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,000
get [ __ ] done all day we're gonna talk

89
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,239
more about that it says those conditions

90
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,799
are the main reasons i've pulled enough

91
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,560
or been pulled into organic growing i

92
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:39,040
found ways to make the workload easier

93
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,799
or less growing with this style i am

94
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:42,479
assuming that there are many others out

95
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,120
there like me who struggle to keep the

96
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:46,959
garden in tip-top shape what would you

97
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,360
advise someone with medical conditions

98
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:52,000
as the minimum things you would need to

99
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,760
do both in veg and flour to keep

100
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,199
everything going so that is the first

101
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:58,878
question that's a very good question um

102
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:00,719
man i'm not sure exactly where to start

103
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:03,359
for everybody but i can give you tips

104
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:05,359
and advice for your needs and for

105
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,319
possibly my needs but if you've got

106
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,000
different

107
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:10,399
limiting factors then i'm not sure what

108
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,120
i would recommend um so you ask what are

109
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,200
the minimum things you would need to do

110
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,798
both in veg and garden so what advice

111
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:18,959
would you give somebody the minimum

112
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,798
things the plants need to be watered

113
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,959
that's the most important thing

114
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:24,478
as a cannabis grower who likes to go

115
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:26,159
places likes to get away one of the

116
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:28,800
things i think about is are these plants

117
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,800
going to get water so set the plants up

118
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,199
in a way that you can water them is the

119
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,639
water itself accessible where does it

120
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,720
come from does it come from a faucet

121
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,560
does it come from a sink a shower some

122
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,320
sort of a tap a well do you have to

123
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,839
[ __ ] pull the water out of the lake

124
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:44,000
where does the water come from make the

125
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:45,279
water easily accessible easily portable

126
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,360
to your grow that's going to be the

127
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:49,119
first step we have to water these plants

128
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,879
at least twice maybe three or four times

129
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,439
a week depending on the size

130
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:55,279
so maybe set it up to where it's easy to

131
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:57,360
water it if it's easier to water it

132
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:59,599
you'll do it more make sure that you're

133
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,879
let's even back up a whole another step

134
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:05,199
is your entire grow space clean tidy and

135
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:07,199
organized and inviting i've noticed that

136
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:09,680
when my workspace if it's my office if

137
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:12,400
it's my garage workspace if it's my grow

138
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:15,038
workspace if it's the podcast area when

139
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:17,679
that space gets cluttered and it's not

140
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:19,279
inviting and presentable my mind is

141
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,840
cluttered when i'm there and i can't

142
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:23,839
perform to the best of my ability so i

143
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:26,399
make sure to keep my grow space as clean

144
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:28,799
as i can my uh nutrient mixing station

145
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:31,120
my nutrient storage area all of that

146
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,879
stuff is it looks like military-grade

147
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,399
cleaning happened in there and that

148
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:35,680
invites me to want to go in there i

149
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:36,879
don't go in there and go i got to move

150
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,720
this [ __ ] out of the way i got to look

151
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:40,478
for this i go i can go in this place

152
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,720
where it is organized and streamlined

153
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:44,478
and ready for me to go so from the very

154
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,400
beginning have everything clean

155
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:48,159
organized streamlined ready to go so

156
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:50,719
that you can set yourself up for success

157
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,639
and be invited in there by yourself

158
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,560
then maybe put some music in there i

159
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,800
love listening to podcasts and music if

160
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,038
there's a bluetooth speaker and a bottle

161
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,560
of kombucha i could be pretty happy just

162
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:02,639
about anywhere if you give me a dab

163
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,399
first things are really irie so i like

164
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,840
to put on a good podcast a lot of people

at least twice a week there's two

180
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,800
episodes of me to listen to two days of

181
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:34,638
growing covered right there there's some

182
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,160

187
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:44,159
love you but encourage and inspire

188
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:46,079
yourself to go in there before we even

189
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,400
start thinking about the gear the room

190
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:50,800
is everything organized clean inviting

191
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:52,638
does it smell good does it look good uh

192
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,840
if it's not organized and inviting i

193
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,439
won't want to go in there and if it's a

194
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:56,959
mess and i do go in there i'm still not

195
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:58,719
going to work to the best of my uh

196
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:00,719
potential my ability and i'm not going

197
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,479
to enjoy it so let's make it inviting

198
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,960
get some music going make it in an

199
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:06,959
environment in which you want to be

200
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:08,799
now the things that are required of of

201
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:09,758
the grower is of course the watering

202
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,680
that's the first thing you're going to

203
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,120
need to get done can you get the water

204
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,478
to the grow without breaking your back

205
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,800
or your neck

206
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:18,478
can you get that water from a big vessel

207
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,840
into the mixing container without

208
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:21,279
breaking your neck or your back do you

209
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:23,598
have a good mixing container do you have

210
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:25,038
a good ph pen do you have a good ec pen

211
00:07:23,598 --> 00:07:28,319
do you have good mixing containers and

212
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:30,240
devices make it fun um maybe if you have

213
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,240
a couple extra bucks spend a few bucks

214
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,478
on devices to make the growing more

215
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,160
simplistic more streamlined and more fun

216
00:07:34,478 --> 00:07:38,079
more toys makes it better for a lot of

217
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,599
people if you get if you get that brand

218
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:41,359
new piece of gear it just may inspire

219
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:43,038
you to regrow again so maybe a new toy

220
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,879
every once in a while reward yourself

221
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:46,800
with a new piece of gear but mainly keep

222
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,560
it clean and get it set up now watering

223
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,319
we've got to get an amount of water from

224
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,399
one container into these plants can you

225
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,879
physically do it if not let's think

226
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:56,638
about setting up a watering system

227
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,240
you can build a watering system with any

228
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:01,120
sort of reservoir i like to use a trash

229
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,639
can a 35 or 55 gallon trash can on

230
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,560
wheels so you can move it to the water

231
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,800
fill it move it where it needs to be

232
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,720
drop a submersible pump in there run

233
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,038
some flex line that runs out of that

234
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,120
reservoir down to the ground down across

235
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:14,478
the floor and then i will put spaghetti

236
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,478
tubing that comes out of that with

237
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:18,478
emitters that go to each plant then i

238
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:20,878
just set that up with a timer and then i

239
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:23,038
know that um depending on the amount of

240
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,400
meters and the amount of emitters and

241
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:26,639
the amount of plants that i've got how

242
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:27,839
much water i want i can set up a timer

243
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,598
to where i know that if i turn on the

244
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:30,959
water for or if i turn on the timer for

245
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:32,718
two minutes that pump runs for two

246
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:34,718
minutes my plants will get enough water

247
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,760
it's really easy to figure that out the

248
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,959
first time you do it you guys if you

249
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:38,718
want to learn that

250
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:40,879
get your plants to where they need water

251
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:43,120
get your auto watering system set up set

252
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:44,480
a timer hit go plug in your pump let the

253
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,639
plants get wet when they're watered

254
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,080
enough hit stop on the timer unplug the

255
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:49,600
thing that's how long you need your

256
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,440
plants to come on your timer to come on

257
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,200
to water your plants every time a minute

258
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,519
and 40 seconds that will get the plant

259
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,440
saturated every time how long between

260
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:59,200
waterings maybe every three days so

261
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,640
every third day you need a minute and 40

262
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,000
seconds worth of watering it's really

263
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:03,199
not that hard to set up once you get

264
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,759
figured out so one of the things you'll

265
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,759
have to do is auto watering or some sort

266
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:09,679
of watering that is required you can't

267
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:11,439
get through without that then the plants

268
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:13,199
are likely going to need some sort of

269
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,399
supports as they grow

270
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,680
they're going to need up pots they're

271
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,720
going to need transplanting so that's

272
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:19,679
things you're going to need to think

273
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,920
about i go from a seedling into a cup

274
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:24,719
then my cup goes into a 3 gallon maybe a

275
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:26,799
one depending on my time space needs but

276
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,480
i'll go from a cup to a maybe a one

277
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:31,039
gallon maybe right to the three and then

278
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,680
from a three maybe to a five or a seven

279
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:34,879
uh but think about your pot sizing think

280
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:36,079
about the up pots that you're gonna have

281
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:37,919
to do that's going to have to happen

282
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,278
then supports the plants are going to

283
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:41,039
get taller and bigger they're going to

284
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:42,320
need more supports are you going to put

285
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:44,079
a trellis net are you going to put

286
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,160
sticks in there that's things that will

287
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:49,200
be required so some watering some up

288
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:51,039
potting some supporting and then a

289
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,800
little bit of defoliation maybe it's not

290
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:55,199
required but it will definitely help you

291
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:57,039
and make things easier so i'm trying to

292
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,800
think of things that we have to do

293
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:02,078
watering is the main thing you have to

294
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:04,639
do supports uh lollipopping twisting

295
00:10:02,078 --> 00:10:06,559
things like that are all bonuses but

296
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:08,240
they should be done so i'm just thinking

297
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:09,919
of the minimum things as watering and

298
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,919
keeping the light cycle going and just

299
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:13,759
keeping the plants supported and happy

300
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:15,360
now with that being said

301
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:17,519
i want to inspire you to get in there

302
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,360
remember that keep in mind that every

303
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,440
day that you don't get up and get in

304
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:24,079
there and do your best in the garden the

305
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:26,240
harvest will show you today you can be

306
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:28,559
as depressed as down as you want you

307
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,720
could push it off or you can go in there

308
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:32,559
and kick ass it's not going to show you

309
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,480
until the back end until you go to cut

310
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:36,159
down at harvest time you're going to say

311
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,920
man if i would have gone in there that

312
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:39,600
one day when i was having that problem

313
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:40,958
and i just didn't feel like it if i

314
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,320
would have gone in there and spent one

315
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:44,399
hour in there and just handled this

316
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,240
issue this harvest weight would be

317
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,240
better this harvest quality would be

318
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,399
better this harvest this harvest

319
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,399
experience overall would be more

320
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,919
rewarding and would be more better more

321
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,278
better sure we're going to go with that

322
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:57,278
and it would be

323
00:10:55,278 --> 00:11:00,159
more rewarding for you spiritually and

324
00:10:57,278 --> 00:11:01,919
mentally and financially as well so

325
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:03,519
think about that think that's what i use

326
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:05,919
as inspiration and motivation when i

327
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:08,078
don't want to do any work if i just go

328
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:09,838
do it when it's done i'm going to feel

329
00:11:08,078 --> 00:11:12,078
better that's a reward within itself and

330
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:14,399
then every little job that you do is a

331
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:16,479
small reward that leads up to the big

332
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,159
full accomplishment of the big picture

333
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,240
of the goal which feels very rewarding

334
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:22,319
you i know tattoo i know that tanto was

335
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,000
a former military person so i know you

336
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,839
know that feeling of accomplishment i

337
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,639
know that you know that feeling of pride

338
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:30,000
dig inside and feel that feeling compare

339
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,958
the feelings inside when you're laying

340
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,120
there go

341
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:36,319
man i could either lay here and let this

342
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:38,000
depression crush me today or or i could

343
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,160
get up and crush the depression and go

344
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,078
spend time with my plants which i love

345
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:43,759
which are like my little children which

346
00:11:42,078 --> 00:11:46,239
put off good vibes which feed me good

347
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:48,078
energy which in a few months also is

348
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,079
going to give me quality medicine and a

349
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:52,000
big reward so i should just get up and

350
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:54,159
not not let this depression not to let

351
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,159
this win today i understand dude i had a

352
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:57,679
traumatic brain injury where for several

353
00:11:56,159 --> 00:11:59,120
months i thought about doing terrible

354
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:00,479
[ __ ] to myself i'm cool now guys don't

355
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,399
worry i'm way past that but that was

356
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,839
years ago i do have a traumatic brain

357
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,120
injury when it first happened i

358
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,600
questioned if i would make it to

359
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,600
tomorrow and i understand the uh the

360
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,600
lack of desire the lack of passion the

361
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,120
lack of anything to get up and do

362
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,480
anything i didn't care if i got up in

363
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,679
eight i didn't care if i got up to pee i

364
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,759
thought i'd just piss in right there

365
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:19,199
because i was so depressed and so dark

366
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:20,399
that who cares i'll just piss on myself

367
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,879
anyway it wouldn't matter i've been

368
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,958
there um you just gotta dig deep man you

369
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:26,480
gotta dig deep inside of yourself and

370
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:27,838
and think that your mind is playing

371
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,600
tricks on you and that you are the

372
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,200
winner of that game you're gonna win

373
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,399
every time don't let that [ __ ] beat you

374
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:36,800
so um the bare minimum is watering

375
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,399
transplanting supporting and then after

376
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:39,439
that everything else is bonus you got to

377
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,440
feed them and you got to change the

378
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,880
light cycle but they will grow i have

379
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,560
friends that leave town for several

380
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:46,078
months at a time because they've got an

381
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:48,399
auto watering system and it just keeps

382
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:50,399
their grow going for them it will happen

383
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,320
but the more you do to it the better it

384
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,320
will become and that's what i'm going to

385
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,519
say would be the motivating factor the

386
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,760
thing that would get you in there is

387
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,360
just knowing like i can grow some

388
00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:01,120
c-grade weed i could do that in my

389
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,879
[ __ ] sleep but if i want to grow a

390
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,799
grade weed i got to get in there i got

391
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:06,078
to touch the plants i got to do the work

392
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:07,679
that's the difference i mentioned that

393
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:09,519
in an episode before that's the

394
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:11,519
difference between a gray and c grade

395
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,360
wheat is just doing the work now another

396
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,919
thing i should really mention is that i

397
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,680
invite you to join my discord server

398

00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:22,638
cheesy but honestly bro um during these

400
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,320
weird times we were isolated through a

pandemic and we had to sit at home and

444
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:49,759
discord i'm rambling tonto i know that

445
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:51,600
may not be the answer you're looking for

446
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:53,198
bro the minimum [ __ ] that has to happen

447
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,199
is they have to be watered other than

448
00:14:53,198 --> 00:14:56,559
that they'll pretty much grow feed them

449
00:14:55,198 --> 00:14:58,559
water them make sure they don't fall

450
00:14:56,559 --> 00:15:00,319
over they're going to do it but you've

451
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:01,838
got to dig deep and get the motivation

452
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,160
and the inspiration to get in there and

453
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:06,000
make those plants champions i know you

454
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:07,679
don't want to smoke sea grate or b-grade

455
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,278
weed remember that when you're feeling

456
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:11,439
down all you got to do is get in there

457
00:15:09,278 --> 00:15:13,120
and do the work and you can make that a

458
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,519
grade weed just use that as your

459
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,360
inspiration then reach out bro uh

461

you in the grow we'll get you going all

465
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,320
right there is more to this it does say

466
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:30,560
second question

467
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:33,839
i do have hopes and dreams of opening a

468
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:36,159
cannabis nursery within canada sometime

469
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:38,800
in the next five to ten years nurseries

470
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:42,319
can have up to 50 meters squared or 5

471
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:44,240
5000 or 538 square foot of canopy space

472
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:47,199
i hope to be selling clones and seeds in

473
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:49,519
the legal market here in canada

474
00:15:47,198 --> 00:15:51,838
i do have two questions based on this

475
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:53,919
are nurseries viable businesses in the

476
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,600
states in your opinion and if you have

477
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:57,759
that allotted space how would you run it

478
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:00,159
and any advice to someone who may jump

479
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:02,079
into that market i know that's a very

480
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:04,000
general and broad

481
00:16:02,078 --> 00:16:06,479
question and then there's more

482
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,480
let's talk about this clone nursery that

483
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,480
is not something that we see

484
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,159
uh completely dedicated to clones here

485
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:15,360
in colorado there's not enough of a

486
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:17,278
market in my opinion to just sell clones

487
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,278
there's one company that i know of that

488
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:21,679
focuses on just clones they seem to do

489
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:23,519
okay but there's only one company i know

490
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:25,359
of that really does that there are two

491
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:27,919
different ways that clones kind of work

492
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:30,480
here in colorado you can make clones and

493
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:31,919
provide clones for the commercial market

494
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,199
which means you've got a big this kind

495
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:35,039
of sounds like what you would try to do

496
00:16:33,198 --> 00:16:37,039
you take your big warehouse and you

497
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:38,879
would cut hundreds of clones maybe

498
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:40,719
thousands of clones probably hundreds of

499
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:42,320
thousands of clones possibly then you

500
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,000
would offer those clones to other

501
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,920
commercial facilities and they would buy

502
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
those and then they would just run your

503
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:49,919
cuts in their grow many commercial

504
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
facilities do rely on somebody to

505
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:54,399
provide those clones they buy them every

506
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,799
time the problem is a lot of facilities

507
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:58,159
will buy clones from you one time they

508
00:16:56,799 --> 00:16:59,679
run all your stuff they find their

509
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:01,039
favorites and they cut a clone of that

510
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:02,319
and then they never have to buy clones

511
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:04,399
from you again so that's one of the

512
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,078
downsides to making clones for the

513
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,919
commercial market once everybody has

514
00:17:06,078 --> 00:17:09,279
their stuff they just start making their

515
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,799
own clones they don't have to call you

516
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:12,879
anymore that's kind of how the clone

517
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:15,679
game works the other option is making

518
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:17,839
clones for the consumer end of the

519
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:19,839
market which is a great idea but also

520
00:17:17,838 --> 00:17:21,599
there are only so many consumers people

521
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:23,038
only grow so much weed

522
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,480
i think there are so many rules in

523
00:17:23,038 --> 00:17:26,078
colorado i'm not even sure if you can

524
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,078
sell a clone to somebody from out of

525
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:29,678
state you may have to have a colorado id

526
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:30,798
to even be able to purchase a clone in a

527
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,400
store i don't know that because i've got

528
00:17:30,798 --> 00:17:34,720
the id so i don't know

529
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,160
uh the steps and skips and caveats to

530
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,120
that but

531
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,400
um for a while my dream and i don't

532
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:41,759
think i'm gonna do this anymore so i

533
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,960
could talk about it but there was there

534
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:45,119
were goals and plans but i kind of

535
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,200
shifted my focus here just because of

536
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:50,399
life and paperwork and things but one of

537
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:52,880
my goals was to open a giant commercial

538
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,080
cultivation facility my one of my dreams

539
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,880
was to

540
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:58,639
make seeds for the recreational market

541
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,640
in colorado i wanted to be able to put

542
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,720
ivory genetics beans on the shelf here

543
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,160
in colorado that was one of the goals

544
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,440
that would be great to walk into a store

545
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,440
and see the seeds but there's so much

546
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,759
red tape that it's almost it's basically

547
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,360
not worth it so i wanted to put seeds on

548
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:13,440
the store shelf which would have

549
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:15,599
required me to produce those seeds in a

550
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,279
commercially licensed grow which then

551
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:19,519
would have given me the advantage and

552
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:22,480
the ability to sell those clones to

553
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:25,440
commercial grows so i wanted to sell

554
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:28,000
clones to commercial grows sell seeds to

555
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:31,519
recreational stores and at the same time

556
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,279
also possibly offer those clones to the

557
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:34,319
recreational stores that was kind of the

558
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:36,079
goal

559
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:37,918
mike and i did a lot of numbers we did a

560
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:39,759
lot of crunching it would have barely

561
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:41,520
made any profit the only way that we

562
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:43,679
think this would have been profitable is

563
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:45,519
if we did a crop where we produced seeds

564
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:48,080
and then sold all the seeds and then did

565
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:50,798
a crop of producing seedless flower and

566
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:52,639
sold the flower to supplement the income

567
00:18:50,798 --> 00:18:54,480
and then in the meantime the flower

568
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,320
would be building hype for the seeds and

569
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,759
be building hype for the clones and then

570
00:18:56,319 --> 00:18:59,038
the clones would be in demand the seeds

571
00:18:57,759 --> 00:19:00,879
would be in demand and we'd sell more

572
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:02,720
flowering clones it was kind of a hoping

573
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,840
to make a cycle out of that but honestly

574
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:08,240
it got uh with all the licensing fees uh

575
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:09,678
the licensing fees basically um and the

576
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,200
rules and regulations and all that it

577
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:13,038
got a little bit ridiculous and we kind

578
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,480
of just i guess we sort of abandoned

579
00:19:13,038 --> 00:19:15,919
ship on that idea i guess things were

580
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,640
working the way that they are mike got

581
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:19,840
two mike had two kids um irie took off

582
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,440
the way that it took off and we kind of

583
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:24,720
abandoned ship that way

584
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:27,440
but just clones in my opinion does not

585
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:30,558
uh look fell look smell feel or seem

586
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:32,558
like a viable option unless you could

587
00:19:30,558 --> 00:19:34,639
develop contracts with commercial

588
00:19:32,558 --> 00:19:35,440
cultivation facilities that will

589
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,679
be

590
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:40,320
relying on you to supply those cuts

591
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:42,000
every however frequently you need they

592
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:45,678
need them and you can supply them

593
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,919
probably every uh 90 75 maybe every 21

594
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:50,080
days depending on how they set up their

595
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:52,400
cycles i ran a big grow we had three

596
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:54,399
flower rooms every 21 days we were

597
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,880
cutting clones uh putting stuff into

598
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,480
flowers 21 day flip turnarounds there

599
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,880
because we had the rooms divided to our

600
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,960
21 days was the gap in between them

601
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,120
anyway if you've got somewhere for those

602
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:08,159
clones to go it may be a viable business

603
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:10,079
but without a predetermined customer for

604
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:12,159
that many clones i don't know you could

605
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:14,158
get that many cuts out however i could

606
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:16,320
be wrong because in the great nation of

607
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:17,679
canada you guys can mail [ __ ] to each

608
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:20,240
other we can't do that here we don't

609
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:22,080
have national legalization we've got

610
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,839
state by state legalization and things

611
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:26,079
cannot leave each state that's highly

612
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:28,079
illegal so with the advantage in canada

613
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:30,000
you can mail things from one end of

614
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:32,798
canada to the other or in the middle or

615
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,038
all over that may be advantageous to you

616
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:36,879
but i don't honestly know the clone

617
00:20:35,038 --> 00:20:38,480
market in canada

618
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,880
again unless you've got that commercial

619
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,480
account or you've got some sort of uh

620
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,000
commercial availability where you can

621
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,839
advertise and say we'll ship clones

622
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,240
everywhere then i don't know if it would

623
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:49,759
work with that catch with that bonus it

624
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,839
may work for you but i don't want to

625
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:53,599
lead you the wrong direction all right i

626
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:56,079
think i rambled on enough about that

627
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:59,519
part of the question there is more it

628
00:20:56,079 --> 00:21:01,839
says where was i i was here um any other

629
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:03,440
possible events you will be at this year

630
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:05,839
other than the groovy gravy event

631
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,440
unfortunately i could not make that one

632
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:08,959
yes i understand you my friend are

633
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,880
canadian i understand you could not make

634
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,960
the groovy gravy secret stash event in

635
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,600
denver however

636
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:18,159
i do not know of any upcoming events in

637
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:19,839
colorado at this time there are a few

638
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:21,679
events coming up in other states i know

639
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:23,119
there's something in oklahoma i know

640
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:24,960
there's stuff on the east coast coming

641
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:27,359
up but i don't know of anything coming

642
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:29,440
up in colorado right now unfortunately

643
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:31,759
with a lot of the rule changes we cannot

644
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:34,080
smoke at any of the events in colorado

645
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:35,519
it's basically illegal to consume inside

646
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:37,038
of a public building like that where

647
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:38,000
people are gathering so we can't really

648
00:21:37,038 --> 00:21:39,679
smoke

649
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,440
we're either allowed to do business or

650
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:43,120
consume and you don't really get to do

651
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,880
both it's kind of weird people are

00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,880
details about the rules up there in

683
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,720
canada i'm very limited in my clone

684
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:48,000
sales here in colorado i could only sell

685
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:49,519
to the uh colorado residents and also

686
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,679
colorado commercial production

687
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:52,960
facilities and then once they've got

688
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:54,960
them they clone them and they don't buy

689
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,798
them very much so only new growers will

690
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:59,038
be buying clones you're in canada where

691
00:22:56,798 --> 00:23:02,000
you can ship nationwide that opens you

692
00:22:59,038 --> 00:23:04,319
up to every single canadian is able to

693
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,079
buy clones i could be completely wrong

694
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:08,079
in my idea that it would not work you've

695
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:10,240
got a different business plan than i had

696
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:11,759

697
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,679
