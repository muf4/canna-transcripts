great podcast together uh you may not

69
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:42,799
even notice it as much as i do i didn't

70
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,239
notice until i put on these headphones

71
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,519
how strong it was but i do notice

72
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,680
there's some crap in the nose from all

73
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,439
the dirty work i was doing today nobody

74
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,599
cares about that what else did i do

75
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:53,680
today i went to the weed doctor that's

76
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:56,000
right i live here in southern colorado

77
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,920
uh in colorado we do have the uh what is

78
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,199
it the right the privilege of medical

79
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:01,359
cannabis we are offered medical

80
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:03,679
marijuana here we do have recreational

81
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,120
cannabis here so many people may say why

82
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,560
do you have your medical marijuana

83
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,000
recommendation your medical marijuana

84
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,120
card from a doctor that's a really good

85
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,439
question there are a couple of reasons

86
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,319
for that first off is it's another layer

87
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:16,000
of safety it's just uh i do grow we can

88
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:17,679
grow legally here but

89
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,598
also having that medical card gives you

90
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,080
another layer of protection for growing

91
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:24,079
also it increases your purchasing power

92
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,760
at dispensaries you're limited uh

93
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,799
certain amounts of milligrams at

94
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:31,280
recreational dispensaries at a um a

95
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:33,120
medical cannabis dispensary the edible

96
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,239
dosage is much higher that is available

97
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,920
so you can get different products in

98
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,080
different places you can buy more i can

99
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:39,839
buy more at a medical shop than i can at

100
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,560
a wreck shop there are a few advantages

101
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,959
of it advantages to it mostly i do it to

102
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,080
keep my garden safe it does allow me so

103
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,759
one of the things i was going to talk

104
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,159
about we are allowed recreational and

105
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:51,518
medical cannabis we can have six plants

106
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:53,120
here recreationally you're allowed to

107
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,280
grow six cannabis plants in your

108
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,719
residence if you're an adult and you've

109
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,000
uh if you want to grow that's well

110
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:59,359
you're illegal right here you can have

111
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,039
six plants

112
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,120
plus if you have your medical marijuana

113
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:04,719
recommendation you are allowed six more

114
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,239
so i do have the medical marijuana card

115
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:08,400
for these six extra plants that does

116
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,158
help me out gives me a total of 12.

117
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,080
not a lot of plants to play with but

118
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:13,438
twice as many as six i'm grateful for

119
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,400
that it helps me out lets me do what i

120
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:16,238
need to do

121
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,680
supply my medicine my product that i do

122
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:19,198
need so

123
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,358
i did go to the weed doctor today

124
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,879
because every year we do have to renew

125
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:24,879
our medical marijuana cards here in

126
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:26,879
colorado we do have the recreational

127
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:29,040
cannabis anybody 21 and up is allowed to

128
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:31,600
have cannabis they can shop in the store

129
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,600
uh if you've got a medical cannabis card

130
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,199
you can be 18. most of the patients are

131
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,759
21 and up it does require special

132
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:40,160
paperwork more doctor visits extra steps

133
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,840
if you're uh 18 but if you're 21 then

134
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,120
you can get that medical cannabis card

135
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:44,560
then you can go to the medical

136
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,800
dispensaries and you can have the extra

137
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,720
plants uh i go get the medical marijuana

138
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,280
card once every year you have to have a

139
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,520
qualifying condition uh mine is that i

140
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:54,959
was in a car wreck in 2003 my knees hit

141
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:56,879
the dash they make a lot of terrible

142
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:58,239
noises uh my shoulder came out of the

143
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:00,319
socket from the seat belt you guys don't

144
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,079
care about medical stuff but that is how

145
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:03,599
that's my they call it your claim to

146
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:04,879
fame for your medical marijuana

147
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,800
recommendation so today i had to go to

148
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:08,319
the weed doctors what i'm getting at and

149
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,000
when i used to go to the weed doctor you

150
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:11,918
would schedule an appointment and if

151
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
you're not watching the video i did air

152
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:15,359
quotes on the word appointment because

153
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,959
uh back in the day when you would make

154
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,800
an appointment to the weed doctor you'd

155
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:21,439
schedule for it seemed like everybody's

156
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,879
scheduled for 10 or 11 am

157
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:25,360
sometimes you wouldn't get to see that

158
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:27,279
weed doctor until five six maybe seven

159
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,879
pm and you'd have to just hang out all

160
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:30,638
day wait your turn wait for your name to

161
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:32,399
be called people would sneak off and go

162
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,840
smoke bulls in the car or sometimes just

163
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:34,799
wherever we could find a spot to go

164
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:36,638
smoke

165
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,319
but the weed doctors were rare and they

166
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,720
would just see a lot of patients in one

167
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:42,159
day they'd show up so this is totally

168
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,840
illegal now and you'll understand why

169
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,160
once i talk about it the weed doctor

170
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:48,079
used to come to the dispensary and set

171
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,759
up shop in the dispensary so we just

172
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:51,918
have the weed doctor all day sign in

173
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,759
weed cards he would charge you so much

174
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:55,839
the dispensary would make a cut off of

175
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:58,319
every card that he sold so if he sold

176
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:59,679
250 weed cards today at a hundred

177
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,600
dollars each is what i think they used

178
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,079
to be we would make 10 bucks so we just

179
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,960
make 10 10 of his whole day right there

180
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:07,199
just for letting him be at our

181
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:08,719
dispensary then as soon as he signs that

182
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,478
paperwork and gives you the stamp from

183
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,560
the uh what's it called a notary now

184
00:06:10,478 --> 00:06:14,240
you're allowed to shop at the dispenser

185
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,160
you're already there why not let's spend

186
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,160
some more money at the dispensaries so

187
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,240
uh they quickly once they made some

188
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,000
rules they quickly banned doctors being

189
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,360
on-site being present at the actual

190
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,639
dispensary they had to do it at an

191
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,400
off-site location they couldn't be

192
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,720
attached to the store it was making a

193
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:30,638
little bit too easy um

194
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,080
but you have to go sit there all day and

195
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,759
then you'd have to bring a file of

196
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:36,000
paperwork with you and explain what was

197
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:38,400
wrong and why you thought cannabis would

198
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
help you out and back in the day the

199
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:41,439
list of qualifying conditions was a

200
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,879
little bit vague it is still a little

201
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:44,879
bit vague i think we kind of they kind

202
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:46,560
of did that on purpose

203
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:48,000
i like the fact that chronic pain is on

204
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,399
there how can you prove that i don't

205
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,759
hurt if i say this hurts can you look at

206
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:53,198
my hand right now and tell me if it does

207
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,439
or does not hurt look i'll pull it up to

208
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:58,000
the camera right there that hurts am i

209
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:59,839
full of [ __ ] or not as a doctor you've

210
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,720
got to take my word for it that it hurts

211
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:02,000
so now you're going to give me my

212
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,680
medical cannabis card right i'm gonna

213
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,800
say this hurts all the time i don't know

214
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,000
why it just does and you're gonna say

215
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,520
did you do anything about it no i smoke

216
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,199
weed and it feels better and you go oh

217
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:10,478
and the doctor just writes your card uh

218
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,319
so that's pretty much how easy it was

219
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:14,478
today i went in there i had an

220
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,560
appointment an actual appointment for 11

221
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:18,079
o'clock i'm that guy i showed up 10

222
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,199
minutes early i was like hey i'm here

223
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:20,560
for my appointment they said oh great

224
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,919
we've got your paperwork ready to go

225

226
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:24,478
date some [ __ ] you know the doctor goes

227
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:25,679
when you check in

228
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:27,279
it took me

229
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,560
uh maybe five minutes to fill out some

230
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:29,839
paperwork just because i know all the

231
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,439
info i don't have to go digging through

232
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:32,879
[ __ ] i know my info my social security

233
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:34,800
number how old i am i know all that [ __ ]

234
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:36,240
you gotta write that down uh i turned in

235
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,240
the paper they said the doctor will be

236
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,598
right with you the doctor came out with

237
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,879
the previous patient and said have a

238
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:42,719
great day it was great helping you out

239
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:43,918
and then she called me back and she said

240
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,039
you look familiar it seems like i've

241
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:46,399
seen you before and i said i've been

242
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:49,360
getting my medical cannabis card from

243
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:50,799
this office since 2008. and she

244
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,400
basically said okay here you go and just

245
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,319
started writing she asked me of course

246
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:56,239
uh what hurts how do you use it and i

247
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,400
said oh my knees hurt and my shoulder

248
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,199
hurts and i take a lot of dabs and she

249
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:01,439
said

250
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:04,000
the state wants me to type in how much

251
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:05,680
you dab and how you use your product and

252
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,680
i said i'd probably dab somewhere

253
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,038
between depending on the day somewhere

254
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,879
between one and two grams of

255
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:12,240
concentrates per day and she said that's

256
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,919
an acceptable answer i look forward to

257
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,079
seeing you next year my whole

258
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:18,478
appointment probably took me maybe 20

259
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:20,159
maybe 30 minutes total with like

260
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:22,399
checking out and paying there is a

261
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,919
process where uh once you've seen the

262
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:26,000
doctor you do have to go on to the

263
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:27,198
colorado medical marijuana there's a

264
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,240
bunch of [ __ ] letters it's the

265
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,478
department of public health and

266
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,799
environment some random [ __ ] website

267
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:34,639
where you have to go there and fill out

268
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:36,478
your recommendation from the doctor and

269
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:38,240
put in some info after the doctor does

270
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,800
their part and once you do that you're

271
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:43,599
good to go the whole thing uh from

272
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:45,278
parking to back in the car uh the entire

273
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,759
appointment was maybe a 30 minute

274
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:50,320
process today and it cost me 80 bucks to

275
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:52,000
the doctor and 30 dollars to the state

276
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,640
of colorado somewhere around that is 80

277
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,039
bucks 85 maybe to the doctor and i think

278
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:59,360
it was 30 or 32 to the state of colorado

279
00:08:57,039 --> 00:09:00,799
so we've come a long way uh to register

280
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,560
with the state used to be a lot more to

281
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:03,919
see the doctor used to be

282
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:05,838
depending on where you win it could be a

283
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:07,120
lot a lot more and now it's really it

284
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,600
was quicker

285
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,039
my stuff was ready within an hour once i

286
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,879
filed that paper with the state of

287
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:14,159
colorado i pushed the go button i got an

288
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:15,838
email an hour later saying you're

289
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:17,439
approved here's your new [ __ ] so you

290
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,040
used to have to wait in the mail

291
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,640
that was the hardest part for a while

292
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:22,159
there they quit allowing us to have

293
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:23,919
temporary cards so when the doctor would

294
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:25,679
sign your [ __ ] that used to mean you're

295
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:27,360
good to go then you have to mail it to

296
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:29,519
the state and wait for your card to come

297
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,200
back at one point they said the

298
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,560
paperwork the tent paperwork is no good

299
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,399
you have to have the actual card so

300
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:35,919
people would see the weed doctor and you

301
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,519
have to mail your [ __ ] to the state and

302
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:38,639
everybody got a weed cart at the same

303
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,639
time

304
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:42,799
so nobody was getting their uh their

305
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:43,919
actual card returned to them for like

306
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:46,240
six or eight weeks it was supposed to

307
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:48,319
take three weeks like it'll be 21 days

308
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,919
but everybody sent in their weed card it

309
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,240
felt like everybody saw the weed doctor

310
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:53,679
at one day they all sent in their paper

311
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,600
it took so long for people to get their

312
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:57,278
cards so everyone's like i did it i paid

313
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,440
the money i sent my [ __ ] to the state i

314
00:09:57,278 --> 00:10:00,720
want my weed card it just took them so

315
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,320
long to get their [ __ ] back that was

316
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,759
frustrating for a little while there i

317
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,440
was amongst that group at one point i

318
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:07,519
was like my card should show up any day

319
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,040
now i'd love to go buy some weed

320
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:11,679
luckily

321
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:13,599
luckily dude i got the hookups anyway

322
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:15,519
i'm rambling the weed the weed card went

323
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,560
super well super easy today the doctor

324
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:20,078
was really cool um this was

325
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:22,078
every time i feel like the doctors are

326
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:23,919
evolving and it's been two or three

327
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:25,599
three or four different doctors for most

328
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:28,159
of my medical cannabis run there was a

329
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,000
guy an old guy an older doctor dr

330
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:31,278
reimers he had a couple of dogs who was

331
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,679
super cool we developed a great

332
00:10:31,278 --> 00:10:35,200
relationship i saw him probably 10 or 12

333
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:36,879
years in a row he passed me off to

334
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,640
another doctor who has now passed me off

335
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:40,559
to this other doctor who i believe i've

336
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:41,679
seen two or three times the doctors are

337
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:45,359
getting

338
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:48,000
more savvy more educated more hip to um

339
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:51,278
cannabis to cannabis usage to cannabis

340
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,360
verbiage terminology dosage the doctor i

341
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:55,360
saw today actually knew what she was

342
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,839
talking about she hinted and implied

343
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:00,079
that she smokes medical cannabis as well

344
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,600
um so it's kind of nice to see the

345
00:11:00,078 --> 00:11:03,359
doctor actually knowing what they're

346
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,040
talking about now before i would go and

347
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,360
i would actually end up educating the

348
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:09,360
doctor and the people in the room and

349
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,278
this time she was on our level so that

350
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,639
was kind of cool uh the process was much

351
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:15,039
easier as the big note that i've got

352
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:16,720
written down they do not pay me to say

353
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:18,078
this you guys they did not give me they

354
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,360
don't even know i've got a show they

355
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:21,759
probably don't even they have no idea

356
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,440
who i am but i'm going to give medical

357
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:25,200
alternatives a shout out they're the

358
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,279
medical cannabis doctor that i saw in

359
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,240
colorado springs today

360
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:32,078
the process was painless and streamlined

361
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,919
the visit was great the doctor was great

362
00:11:32,078 --> 00:11:35,759
the parking was easy the location was

363
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:37,519
cool to get to so if you've got the

364
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:39,360
opportunity or the need i would

365
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,519
recommend medical alternatives in

366
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:44,560
colorado springs just google them it

367
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:46,959
will pop up um it does cost a few bucks

368
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:48,479
uh if you are a new patient you may need

369
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:50,958
some medical records you may need to

370
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:53,278
bring some uh some proof that you are uh

371
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:54,719
sick or injured and or have a qualifying

372
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:56,559
condition that will qualify you for

373
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,879
medical cannabis keep in mind

374
00:11:56,559 --> 00:12:00,319
those rules are quite flexible

375
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:02,320
some paperwork will help you out though

376
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:05,040
something else i want to talk about

377
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:08,480
they do offer what is called an extended

378
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:11,039
plant count um

379
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,959
in many counties in colorado you are not

380
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:14,319
allowed to even honor the extended plant

381
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:15,599
count if you pay for that what's an

382
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,200
extended plan account let me talk about

383
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,600
that extended plant count it sounds just

384
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,200
like what what what it is uh earlier i

385
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,120
said i'm allowed to grow six plants for

386
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,440
my recreational rights i can just grow

387
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,200
six just because we're in colorado i

388
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,000
also said i can grow six more because of

389
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:32,720
my medical rights that gives me six more

390
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,720
my doctor could if i of course pay them

391
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,480
more money that's the whole thing here

392
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:40,399
if i give the doctor more money and it's

393
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:41,839
tiered uh if i want to grow um i'm given

394
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,278
six if i want to go like and i'm just

395
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:45,279
hypothetical with the numbers because i

396
00:12:43,278 --> 00:12:47,120
don't remember if i want to add another

397
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:49,039
10 to 12 plants it's like another 100

398
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,879
bucks if i want to add 20 to 30 more

399
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:52,559
plants it's like 250 more bucks if i

400
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:55,278
want to go up more and more plants it

401
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:56,799
just tears it's like 350 500 1000 bucks

402
00:12:55,278 --> 00:12:57,838
depending on how many more plants you

403
00:12:56,799 --> 00:12:59,599
want to grow

404
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:02,079
which back in the day that was awesome i

405
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,600
used to i used to rock the [ __ ] out of

406
00:13:02,078 --> 00:13:05,599
those extended plant counts those used

407
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,278
to be my best friends we built

408
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,519
dispensaries and businesses off of

409
00:13:07,278 --> 00:13:10,958
extended plant counts i basically say uh

410
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,200
we'll give you a fat discount at our

411
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:14,319
dispensary if you let us have your plant

412
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,560
count because you could assign your

413
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,160
plants to our dispensary it was a big it

414
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:19,359
was just paperwork that we used to jump

415
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:21,759
around through and play with back in the

416
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,919
day so the extended plant counts used to

417
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:26,958
be awesome in my opinion now

418
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:28,799
unfortunately um in pueblo county where

419
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:30,719
i do live they don't care about an

420
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:32,958
extended plant count counties have been

421
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:36,000
allowed to make their own caps on plant

422
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:38,159
limits they can cap plant counts they

423
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,919
can cap grow size they can make the

424
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:41,759
county can decide they can override they

425
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:42,879
can supersede any rules that your state

426
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:45,519
has made

427
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:47,679
regarding your cannabis so pueblo here

428
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:49,919
we're allowed to have 12 plants most of

429
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:51,359
the counties in pueblo are limited to 12

430
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:53,360
total so if you're paying for that

431
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,959
extended plant count and you're growing

432
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,759
that extended plant count i would do a

433
00:13:54,958 --> 00:14:00,479
lot of research on your location and see

434
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:02,559
if your location does honor or if it

435
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,480
bars that extended plant count some

436
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:07,119
places are limited to six some are

437
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,720
limited to 12 some give you 24 if you're

438
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,078
in one of those properly zoned areas

439
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,160
they don't give a [ __ ] how many plants

440
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:14,958
you grow as long as you're following uh

441
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:17,278
your card limit which could be up to 99

442
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:19,359
in some cases um once you cross that

443
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:21,198
hundred plant threshold uh then you're

444
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,519
in that federal zone and once you have

445
00:14:21,198 --> 00:14:25,039
so many plants i'm sure of it because

446
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,639
you have to send in special paperwork

447
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:29,439
and [ __ ] you're in a computer system

448
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:31,680
that says [ __ ] roster jeff has 12

449
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,440
plants grover down the street he's got

450
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:34,958
99. who do you think they're going to

451
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,360
come looking for when some [ __ ] goes

452
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:39,198
wrong who's on the radar first

453
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,360
that's just my opinion i'm going to grow

454
00:14:39,198 --> 00:14:43,519
12 mind my own [ __ ] business just fly

455
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,879
by the the what's it called fly under

456
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,639
the radar that's what i'm trying to say

457
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:47,838
all right i'm high and rambly i feel

458
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:48,879
like the [ __ ] out of my nose is starting

459
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:50,240
to work itself out now that i've been

460
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:51,360
talking a little bit mike sounds better

461
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,519
in my head

462
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:56,240
um so the weed card went super smooth

463
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:57,839
today basically um what hurts and i said

464
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,039
my wallet and she said yep it's gonna

465
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:01,680
hurt more give me some money and i said

466
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:03,838
here you go so let's move forward i did

467
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:05,599
get a reply from a previous episode i

468
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,199
did an episode talking about growing

469
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,360
seeds and i said that if you leave the

470
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:11,278
seeds in the plants too long they can

471
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,278
get too hard and they will not germinate

472
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:14,799
properly i do have a screenshot of my

473
00:15:13,278 --> 00:15:16,320
phone the battery is almost dead so

474
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:18,399
let's see if we can pull this up super

475
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,480
quickly here it does say

476
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,839
seeds don't over ripe it's not a fruit

477
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,480
it's a seed i've never heard of them

478
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:26,800
getting too hard can you explain that

479
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,720
yet really quickly nice and easily uh

480
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:30,240
they get too hard if you leave them in

481
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,839
the plant for too long and you let them

482
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,159
grow for too long

483
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:36,560
that shell that outer husk the whole the

484
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:38,958
the [ __ ] shell dude the seed the bean

485
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:40,719
becomes too hard and they simply have a

486
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:43,919
hard time germinating you can soak them

487
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:45,759
in water you can uh scarify them you can

488
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:47,679
rub them on a matchbox you can do all

489
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:49,839
kinds of [ __ ] to them and they don't

490
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:51,278
germinate very easily sometimes you got

491
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:53,199
to put them in a seed cracker which i

492
00:15:51,278 --> 00:15:55,439
really don't like to do but if you let

493
00:15:53,198 --> 00:15:57,679
the seeds go for too long they do have

494
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,279
the opportunity just simply to get too

495
00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:01,359
hard that's there's not a lot of

496
00:15:59,278 --> 00:16:02,879
explaining to do they get so hard they

497
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,120
don't germinate and it's from letting

498
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:07,919
them grow for too long this is most

499
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:10,000
commonly done with outdoor seeds because

500
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:11,439
i'm learning to grow outdoors now and

501
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,639
the outdoor seeds excuse me for the burp

502
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,279
i'm going to talk right over that excuse

503
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:17,278
me the outdoor seeds seem to go from

504
00:16:15,278 --> 00:16:18,639
like that's almost ready almost ready

505
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:20,559
almost ready to [ __ ] i should have cut

506
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:22,720
that that down yesterday like that's how

507
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:24,479
i feel like the outdoor seeds went so uh

508
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,399
some of them did get really hard really

509
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,680
big really fat some of them did not

510
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,679
germinate on a couple of the plants

511
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:31,039
those never went anywhere i tested those

512
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:32,719
i'm not happy with that so those seeds

513
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:33,838
will just end up on the back burner uh

514
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,000
you never know what those will end up

515
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:38,000
doing but um yeah some of the seeds

516
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,360
simply got too hard that's the best uh

517
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,078
best description i can give you bro they

518
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,278
got too hard they won't germinate and uh

519
00:16:42,078 --> 00:16:44,799
those are the seeds that you gotta soak

520
00:16:43,278 --> 00:16:46,320
in water overnight or you gotta put them

521
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:47,758
in a matchbox and shake them up to where

522
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,040
they get the the shell gets a little

523
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:50,320
scratched a little scarified on the

524
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:52,559
outside or i've seen people put them in

525
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:55,360
a seed cracker so that's what i mean by

526
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:56,719
the seeds getting too hard another thing

527
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,639
that can happen that we've seen happen

528
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,160
in outdoor grows if you leave the seeds

529
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:02,079
in those plants too long or leave the

530
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:03,519
plants out there growing too long the

531
00:17:02,078 --> 00:17:05,279
humidity and the moisture from the

532
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:08,000
outside environment or just that

533
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:10,318
moisture inside the buds can trigger

534
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,480
those seeds to germinate inside of the

535
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:13,918
plants it's really an interesting site

536
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,838
to see it's also terrible because i know

537
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:17,919
how many seeds are being wasted

538
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:19,519
but they're just sprouting right there

539
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:20,880
inside the buds you got a bud that looks

540
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:22,558
like this microphone right and just

541
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,079
little germination tails coming out of

542
00:17:22,558 --> 00:17:25,519
it it looks like worms climate little

543
00:17:24,078 --> 00:17:28,399
caterpillars or worms climbing out of

544
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:29,918
your plant so um that is what happens if

545
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,679
you leave them in there too long that is

546
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:33,520
also a sign we're going to keep rambling

547
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:36,160
here because we're on a thought process

548
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:38,400
here that is also a sign to me that the

549
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,160
seeds do not need to be wintered a lot

550
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,600
of people talk about when the seeds come

551
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,200
out of plants they need to be cold or

552
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:44,798
they need to be preserved for a period

553
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,279
of time before they can grow nah bro

554
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:48,639
they're ready right now they're ready

555
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:50,720
they would just normally fall into a

556
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,559
cold environment with some snow or

557
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,000
non-ideal conditions they'd need to wait

558
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:55,359
a little while to get proper environment

559
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,440
then they'd sprout up but no they're

560
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:59,759
ready to go when they're in that plant

561
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:02,400
we've seen them sprout inside the buds

562
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:04,240
and ruin the entire [ __ ] project so

563
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,600
um yeah the seeds can go too long

564
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,599
they'll get too hard and if you leave

565
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:09,199
them in there way too long they will

566
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:11,199
germinate all right let's keep this

567
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,840
school bus moving the next thing i want

568
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,038
to talk about is flowering time i do

569
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:16,959
want to send a big shout out to my

570
00:18:15,038 --> 00:18:18,720
friend who reminded me to talk about

571
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,160
this on the show i was talking with the

572
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,839
bro today and he's like you know what

573
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,600
this and i was like i should say that on

574
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:25,839
the show so big shout out to my friend

575
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:28,000
for reminding me to say this on the show

576
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:29,839
you know who you are i wouldn't be where

577
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,440
i am without you bro so

578
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:33,678
something i should talk about i am a

579
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,919
seed breeder i do make seeds on the back

580
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:38,320
of my seed packaging i do list a

581
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:40,080
recommended flowering time a lot of

582
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:42,480
those times are generally nine to ten

583
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:44,480
weeks what i breed generally takes 9 to

584
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,000
10 weeks i know that's a general time

585
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,079
frame but most of my plans will be done

586
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,919
within that time frame

587
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:54,720
when i say 9 to 10 weeks i don't mean

588
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:57,120
cut it down at the beginning of week 9.

589
00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:00,000
when i say nine weeks i recommend you

590
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:02,000
finish that ninth week don't shortchange

591
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,720
yourself by cutting down your plants way

592
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,798
too early i am recommending nine to ten

593
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:09,120
weeks and i see people cutting their

594
00:19:06,798 --> 00:19:11,519
plants down at the beginning of week

595
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:15,119
nine you're ripping yourself off by

596
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:16,879
potentially 14 maybe 21 days of

597
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:18,959
potential growth and improvement you

598
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:21,039
could have gotten from that crop

599
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:24,000
imagine how much more weight you could

600
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:25,919
have gotten from 20 14 to 21 more days

601
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
of growth out of that plant

602
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:30,160
imagine how much potency imagine how

603
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,798
much flavor if that plant had that much

604
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:34,320
more time to go so hypothetically if

605
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:37,359
you're cutting it down at the start of

606
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:40,319
week nine what is that that's uh 50 59

607
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:42,159
days right 56 57 days

608
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:44,879
you should be cutting down at least day

609
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:47,519
63 is the end of week nine right that's

610
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:49,360
the end of yeah 56 is eight weeks 63 is

611
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:51,599
nine weeks let it go so technically

612
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:53,279
you've only gone eight weeks on day one

613
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:55,038
of week nine you've gotta finish that

614
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:56,558
week what i'm trying to say what i'm

615
00:19:55,038 --> 00:19:58,240
trying to get into your head is when i

616
00:19:56,558 --> 00:20:01,119
say nine weeks

617
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:03,038
finish the ninth week if i say you've

618
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:04,158
got to go to this class four nine weeks

619
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:05,440
you don't go to the class for eight

620
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:07,600
weeks and don't go to the ninth week

621
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,360
then you don't graduate you fail that is

622
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:11,839
the same way with growing ganja you've

623
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:13,918
got to finish the ninth week sometimes

624
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:15,918
you've got to finish the tenth week

625
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:18,559
sometimes even though i wrote nine to

626
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:21,679
ten weeks on your package sometimes you

627
00:20:18,558 --> 00:20:24,158
may need to let that bad dog go 11 weeks

628
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:26,159
there are anomalies there are outliers

629
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:28,799
uh sometimes those longer flowering

630
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:30,799
plants are the most potent the most uh

631
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:32,960
heavy hitting the most delicious the

632
00:20:30,798 --> 00:20:34,720
most impressive plants in the grow so

633
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:38,240
when i'm saying 9 to 10 weeks i

634
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:39,839
definitely mean 63 days or more

635
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,640
and if you're running the first run with

636
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:44,720
that plant definitely go 70 days i

637
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:47,520
always recommend going longer on your

638
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:49,759
first run it's the inaugural run we want

639
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:51,839
to see the potential of that plant how

640
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:54,400
do you know that and a lot of times

641
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:56,399
plants will do special [ __ ] on the last

642
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,480
10 to 14 days of their flowering cycle

643
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,640
they'll change colors they'll change

644
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,159
terpenes they'll change everything it'll

645
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,600
just go totally different right at the

646
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:05,760
end there that's how you know it's done

647
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:08,000
it goes into senescence and it expresses

648
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:09,839
the end of the plant sometimes we never

649
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,839
see that how do you know that maybe at

650
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:13,439
the end it just doubles in size maybe at

651
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:15,439
the end it doubles in potency maybe at

652
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:18,000
the end it puts off this crazy gassy

653
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:20,080
terp you never noticed so again i highly

654
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:24,319
recommend that you let the plants finish

655
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:27,038
when i say 9 weeks that means 63 days

656
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:29,759
often when i say 9 weeks that means 70

657
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:32,158
days in breeder talk i do talk in ranges

658
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:33,919
and in terms keep in mind there are

659
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:35,840
anomalies in these plants i said it a

660
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:37,679
moment ago you're going to get outliers

661
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:40,000
there will be phenotypical differences

662
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:41,600
your grow room is different your lights

663
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,319
your environment your feed your

664
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:47,839
temperature your humidity your vpd your

665
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:49,439
co2 all your abuse your love your care

666
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:51,359
that you cuss the plants out did you

667
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,279
give them hugs all of that stuff is

668
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:55,279
gonna make a difference in the flowering

669
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:57,200
time of these plants so i highly

670
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:59,918
recommend once again that you let them

671
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:03,279
finish when i say nine weeks again that

672
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:05,280
is finish week nine when i say ten weeks

673
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:07,519
finish week ten don't get too excited

674
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:09,359
don't get overzealous don't get eager

675
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:11,759
and ruin everything you've edged for how

676
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:14,319
many days probably 30 45 days something

677
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:16,720
like that then you flower for seven

678
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:18,639
weeks when you should have gone for nine

679
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,880
don't sell yourself short don't cut

680
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:23,360
yourself off short don't rip yourself

681
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:25,520
off set yourself up for success and

682
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:28,000
reach your potential by letting these

683
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:30,158
plants finish let them finish

684
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,919
everybody's happier when you let them

685
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:33,520
finish all right where do we go from

686
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:35,440
there i've got one more question we're

687
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:37,359
going to cover on this episode somebody

688
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:40,000
asked me if it would be possible to

689
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:42,399
reverse one branch of a plant and

690
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,240
pollinate another branch of the same

691
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,159
plant and i said yes that would

692
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,720
absolutely be

693
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:51,200
possible you can do that um another

694
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,720
thing i should mention is do not smoke

695
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,880
reversed plants i don't know if that

696
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,480
needs to be said i'm not sure if that is

697
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:59,440
something that needed to be pointed out

698
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:01,038
or talked about but do not smoke the

699
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,919
plants that have been treated with

700
00:23:01,038 --> 00:23:05,599
silver let's not do that it's now it is

701
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:07,038
technically a pollen donor plant there

702
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:08,879
are not buds on there that's not

703
00:23:07,038 --> 00:23:12,000
smokeable bud you want to smoke female

704
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:14,159
buds anyway but many people have said uh

705
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,599
that that is a problem it's dangerous to

706
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:18,000
smoke weed that has been sprayed with

707
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:19,439
silver bro it's you're not don't smoke

708
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,200
that if you're thinking about it

709
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,519
correctly you're not gonna smoke that

710
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,960
don't do that that's my disclaimer never

711
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:26,879
smoke weed that has been sprayed with

712
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,640
silver what's the next thing oh is it

713
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,880
possible to reverse that one branch yes

714
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,799
if you've got one plant you can grow it

715
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,640
and create two tops on it or two

716
00:23:32,798 --> 00:23:36,558
branches however you want to do it you

717
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,559
can isolate one branch and treat that

718
00:23:36,558 --> 00:23:42,000
one branch with a silver solution at the

719
00:23:38,558 --> 00:23:43,759
proper timing dilution uh schedule all

720
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,159
the right [ __ ] treat that one branch it

721
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:47,839
will make pollen you can let that pollen

722
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:49,440
fly wherever you want it's likely going

723
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:51,278
to go in the whole room but you can't

724
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,360
hit specific branches if you try hard

725
00:23:51,278 --> 00:23:55,359
enough and you can pollinate the

726
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:57,439
opposite branch on that plant i've done

727
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:59,918
one plant where i topped it low let it

728
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,919
grow two big tall tops i reversed one

729
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:03,440
side i kept the other side pure female

730
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,960
and i just let those two dance around

731
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,600
together and it made femme seeds out of

732
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:10,240
one plant that is definitely possible

733
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:12,399
you can do that have done it do that

734
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,000
make some seeds have some fun all right

735
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,600
i think that is all the time i've got

736
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
for this episode there's some editing to

737
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:20,959
be done here i got to do some processing

738
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,798
to make this voice sound magical ladies

739
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,558
