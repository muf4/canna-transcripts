19
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,270
about determining ripeness this was

23
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,000
long but I cut out the part about

24
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:58,469
determining ripeness and that was

25
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,539

lasts either way if it does disappear

167
00:05:45,029 --> 00:05:49,709
I'll find any place to put it don't

168
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:50,789
worry YouTube is up that's just another

169
00:05:49,709 --> 00:05:52,620
place for more people to listen to the

170
00:05:50,788 --> 00:05:54,000
show I think we'll probably get more

171
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:56,788
more lessons more views more

172
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,050
interactions alright Mike you got

173
00:05:56,788 --> 00:06:01,889
anything to say before we start talking

174
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:03,629
about determining ripeness on cannabis

175
00:06:01,889 --> 00:06:05,788
plants you got me topics you want to

176
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:09,569
bring before we get on a ramble here not

177
00:06:05,788 --> 00:06:11,250
yes Mike says we'll see where this takes

178
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:13,649
us alright so a lot of people were

179
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:15,870
talking on Instagram live and on chat

180
00:06:13,649 --> 00:06:17,698
rooms right now about how to decide when

181
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:21,899
to harvest their cannabis when is my

182
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:23,699
cannabis ripe the seed packs are gonna

183
00:06:21,899 --> 00:06:25,799
tell you a certain timeframe they're

184
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:28,650
gonna say 56 to 63 days they're gonna

185
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:31,900
say 63 to 70 days they're gonna say 9 to

186
00:06:28,649 --> 00:06:34,929
10 weeks the first time you run that

187
00:06:31,899 --> 00:06:36,758
pack of seeds I would say go the longest

188
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:39,250
time frame that they give you as an

189
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:41,500
option at least plan for for sure yes

190
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:44,139
yeah if it says ten wheat nine to ten

191
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:45,639
weeks go the ten weeks because maybe in

192
00:06:44,139 --> 00:06:48,220
that last week that's when you're gonna

193
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:49,960
see extra trichomes pack on you're gonna

194
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:52,210
see the extra weight come on you're

195
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:54,099
gonna see maybe some cool colors you

196
00:06:52,209 --> 00:06:56,198
might you may you may see some [ __ ] you

197
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:58,090
don't see if you cut it down at week

198
00:06:56,199 --> 00:07:00,038
nine so let it go ten weeks if it says

199
00:06:58,089 --> 00:07:00,638
ten weeks if it says fifty six to sixty

200
00:07:00,038 --> 00:07:02,500
three days

201
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,720
let it go sixty three let it go

202
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:08,829
sixty-five if it looks okay and see what

203
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:11,199
happens so that being said the way to

204
00:07:08,829 --> 00:07:15,550
determine ripeness of your cannabis

205
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:20,590
plants is not by looking at the hairs

206
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:22,509
it is not by looking at it's not by

207
00:07:20,589 --> 00:07:25,209
looking at I did air quotes when I said

208
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:30,719
I'm just I'm hearing different people

209
00:07:25,209 --> 00:07:33,250
throughout my cannabis career right like

210
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,560
speaking at length about how all of

211
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:38,500
those are telltale signs of like either

212
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:40,660
perfect or gooder or completed or

213
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:43,180
operated a harvester and it's all

214
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:45,099
nonsense yeah what we are growing

215
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:48,038
cannabis for the viable part that we

216
00:07:45,098 --> 00:07:50,259
want are the trichomes why would we look

217
00:07:48,038 --> 00:07:51,908
at anything but the trichomes right we

218
00:07:50,259 --> 00:07:53,800
want to harvest those when they're at

219
00:07:51,908 --> 00:07:56,288
their right best point so we should be

220
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:58,389
paying attention to the trichomes the

221
00:07:56,288 --> 00:07:59,800
only way you can do that you can if

222
00:07:58,389 --> 00:08:02,560
somebody tells you they can see the

223
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:04,840
trichomes with their naked eye either

224
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,430
steal their eyes or kick them in the

225
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:09,038
dick because they're a liar you cannot

226
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:11,590
see amber trichomes without some sort of

227
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:14,228
magnification you need at least 60 X

228
00:08:11,589 --> 00:08:17,049
maybe a hundred X magnification to see

229
00:08:14,228 --> 00:08:20,709
if a trichome is clear cloudy silver

230
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:22,990
milky amber busted ruptured if the heads

231
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:24,788
broken off of it you need magnification

232
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:26,098
you cannot see that with the naked eye

233
00:08:24,788 --> 00:08:28,060
and if you can you're [ __ ] awesome

234
00:08:26,098 --> 00:08:28,949
send me a message I want to hear about

235
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:32,320
it

236
00:08:28,949 --> 00:08:34,300
good good on Amazon start looking at

237
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,729
scopes folks yeah get yourself a like a

238
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:38,500
jeweler's loupe I have a scope from Dino

239
00:08:36,729 --> 00:08:41,020
light that hooks up to my computer I

240
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:43,658
plug it right into the USB slot it took

241
00:08:41,019 --> 00:08:45,169
me just a few minutes to mess with the

242
00:08:43,658 --> 00:08:47,179
drivers to make it

243
00:08:45,169 --> 00:08:48,949
to my computer once it linked up it was

244
00:08:47,179 --> 00:08:51,109
no problem ever I open up the

245
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:53,629
application I'm able to run the scope

246
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:55,220
over the plants and I can focus it in

247
00:08:53,629 --> 00:08:58,070
and I can see those trichomes

248
00:08:55,220 --> 00:09:00,230
very large on my computer screen it

249
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:01,820
makes it very and I can take pictures so

250
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:03,139
if I can't tell exactly what I'm looking

251
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:05,650
at I can reach over and I think I press

252
00:09:03,139 --> 00:09:07,909
f11 and I take a photo right there boom

253
00:09:05,649 --> 00:09:09,500
then I can go look later and I can see

254
00:09:07,909 --> 00:09:11,419
if that plants ripe or not the the

255
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:13,370
computerized scope makes life a lot

256
00:09:11,419 --> 00:09:15,229
easier but you can pick up something

257
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:16,879
kind of like a jeweler's loupe it's a

258
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:19,370
lot less expensive and just as

259
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:21,200
functional the 420 scope will work for

260
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:23,149
you just a basic jeweler's loupe will

261
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,700
work for you there's one that Hydrofarm

262
00:09:23,149 --> 00:09:27,199
sells it spreads in half it's got

263
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,640
batteries in it then it splits in half

264
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,050
and the batteries are in one side and

265
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:33,080
the optics are actually on the other

266
00:09:30,049 --> 00:09:34,939
side they make a 60 and a 100x I would

267
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:36,950
recommend the 100x if you go for that

268
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:38,510
that's probably the best one on the

269
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:40,280
market if you're gonna get something

270
00:09:38,509 --> 00:09:42,470
like that that I'm aware of there's

271
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:44,959
probably something better by now but

272
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:47,120
it's a magnification magnification will

273
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:49,009
help you out in so many ways you'll be

274
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,659
able to tell if your trichomes are clear

275
00:09:49,009 --> 00:09:51,950
if they're silver if they're cloudy if

276
00:09:50,659 --> 00:09:54,230
they're milky if they're amber if

277
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:56,420
they're ruptured also you'll be able to

278
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:57,830
identify the pests and the funguses and

279
00:09:56,419 --> 00:09:59,959
the problems on the underside of your

280
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:02,000
leaves more accurately if you've got a

281
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:04,250
scope to look at those it's a really

282
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,929
useful tool throughout the growth cycle

283
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:08,450
for sure yeah once you've got all of

284
00:10:05,929 --> 00:10:09,949
your tools dialed in and you've got some

285
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:10,759
money to spend on a couple extra toys

286
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:12,920
for the grow room

287
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:14,659
get yourself a scope it will really help

288
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:15,939
a scope or a loop or something that

289
00:10:14,659 --> 00:10:19,159
hooks up to your computer

290
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:21,290
alright so the hairs are not gonna tell

291
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:22,639
you how ready your plant is Mike just

292
00:10:21,289 --> 00:10:24,620

295
00:10:27,019 --> 00:10:34,519

296
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:36,050
behind us here you guys switchin tell

297
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:37,639
you for cannabis plants are ripe are the

298
00:10:36,049 --> 00:10:38,990
trichomes we're growing four trichomes

299
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:40,669
that's what we want if you're growing to

300
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:41,720
make quality flowers if you're gonna

301
00:10:40,669 --> 00:10:43,009
make edibles if you're gonna make

302
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,899
extracts if you're gonna make anything

303
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:48,740
the trichomes are what matter so pay

304
00:10:44,899 --> 00:10:50,659
attention to that nothing else now the

305
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:52,220
way that you can tell the trichomes

306
00:10:50,659 --> 00:10:53,959
you're gonna see the trichomes develop

307
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:55,250
on your plant if you have a scope and

308
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:57,889
you can pay attention through the entire

309
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:58,730
process do that watch those trichomes go

310
00:10:57,889 --> 00:11:01,250
from a little bit

311
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:04,039
stocke watch them develop ahead watch

312
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:06,379
the head of that trichome fill up you'll

313
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:08,480
watch it fill up it'll get juicy and

314
00:11:06,379 --> 00:11:11,149
then it'll start to change colors it'll

315
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:13,909
go from clear then it'll slowly turn to

316
00:11:11,149 --> 00:11:14,509
like a silver ish color then it'll get

317
00:11:13,909 --> 00:11:16,639
cloudy

318
00:11:14,509 --> 00:11:18,139
you'll be once you see it you'll know

319
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:20,659
right now you're going what does he mean

320
00:11:18,139 --> 00:11:22,430
by cloudy you've got to imagine if you

321
00:11:20,659 --> 00:11:24,350
got a fishbowl and then you put some

322
00:11:22,429 --> 00:11:26,179
dish soap in there and stirred it up

323
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:28,159
it's cloudy that's what you're cloudy

324
00:11:26,179 --> 00:11:30,649
trichomes are gonna look like that's

325
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:33,740
cloudy now your next step after cloudy

326
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:35,839
is milky sometimes they turn kind of

327
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:38,930
bluish in my opinion they have a hint of

328
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:40,910
blue they have that if you stir it like

329
00:11:38,929 --> 00:11:42,799
certain white paints and whatnot you'll

330
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:44,929
start to see a blue kind of undertone a

331
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:47,958
little bit yeah yeah and it's yeah a

332
00:11:44,929 --> 00:11:50,149
nice patch of milky trichomes I always

333
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:51,768
see just a little hint of light blue in

334
00:11:50,149 --> 00:11:53,389
there so the fishbowl I talked about a

335
00:11:51,769 --> 00:11:55,459
minute ago imagine if I took your

336
00:11:53,389 --> 00:11:56,750
fishbowl that had we dumped out the dish

337
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:58,819
so because this is just gonna get gross

338
00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:00,440
if we keep adding stuff I'm gross let's

339
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:02,000
do this differently imagine if you took

340
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:04,819
a fishbowl that's got water in it and

341
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:08,089
you poured just enough milk in there to

342
00:12:04,818 --> 00:12:10,159
make it turn light white light white not

343
00:12:08,089 --> 00:12:12,079
it's not gonna be [ __ ] boom like ice

344
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:13,399
cream but it's gonna be light white like

345
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:15,169
you poured some creamer in your coffee

346
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:17,028
you just lighten it up you can see it

347
00:12:15,169 --> 00:12:19,208
now now that trichome is what I would

348
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:22,818
call milky that is a milky trichome

349
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:25,129
we're almost ready for harvest the next

350
00:12:22,818 --> 00:12:27,349
step that's gonna happen is gonna look

351
00:12:25,129 --> 00:12:28,850
like you had a spray bottle imagine if I

352
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:29,990
took like the little spray bottle that

353
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:31,850
you're spraying your plants with or

354
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:33,919
whatever you did little mister bottle

355
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:35,659
what if I poured some dr. pepper in

356
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:38,990
there and I walked right up to your

357
00:12:35,659 --> 00:12:42,469
trichomes and just just give it a little

358
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:44,870
spritz of dr. pepper your trichomes are

359
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:47,060
gonna have a little amber spritz on them

360
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:48,649
now and that's exactly what I think it

361
00:12:47,059 --> 00:12:51,859
looks like is like you sprayed some soda

362
00:12:48,649 --> 00:12:53,600
right onto your trichomes they're gonna

363
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:56,089
go from milky and then you're gonna see

364
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,639
just a couple of them get this amber

365
00:12:56,089 --> 00:13:00,380
color this dr. pepper color right across

366
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:02,149
them and you're gonna see it happen

367
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:04,370
toward the top and kind of right in the

368
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:05,328
middle and then keep pay attention to

369
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:08,149
the whole planck's it's gonna move

370
00:13:05,328 --> 00:13:09,799
around but when you see that first bit

371
00:13:08,149 --> 00:13:12,080
of amber really start paying attention

372
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:13,909
because you've got a very short time now

373
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:15,320
they're gonna start that Amber is gonna

374
00:13:13,909 --> 00:13:18,199
start progressing throughout the plant

375
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:21,589
really quickly and when you look at the

376
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:23,750
scope and you can see you're gonna have

377
00:13:21,589 --> 00:13:25,820
to look around the plant when 30% of

378
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:29,870
those trichomes start becoming amber

379
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:32,329
that's when you want to cut down 30% now

380
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:33,919
I say look in several places you're

381
00:13:32,328 --> 00:13:35,569
gonna be like 30% how do I know and I

382
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:37,278
can see a hundred trichomes in there

383
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:41,269
just look around and use your best

384
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:43,639
judgment you guys about 25 to 35 percent

385
00:13:41,269 --> 00:13:44,990
is where you want to aim for you're not

386
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:47,059
gonna notice a difference if you're a

387
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:48,799
few days off on your harvest honestly

388
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:50,419
you are not going to notice a huge

389
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:52,759
difference you've got a dry and cure

390
00:13:50,419 --> 00:13:54,919
period once you cut down these plants

391
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:57,169
those trichomes are going to continue to

392
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:59,149
change all the way until the moment you

393
00:13:57,169 --> 00:14:01,399
combust them you're gonna cut them down

394
00:13:59,149 --> 00:14:03,200
you've got this dry period they're gonna

395
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:05,539
get beat up and harvest they're gonna

396
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:07,310
get cured they're gonna change there's

397
00:14:05,539 --> 00:14:09,409
going to be so many different changes in

398
00:14:07,309 --> 00:14:11,328
those trichomes so just a couple of days

399
00:14:09,409 --> 00:14:13,189
in your harvest window will not make a

400
00:14:11,328 --> 00:14:15,559
huge difference you're not gonna notice

401
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:17,839
it it's not gonna hurt your feelings so

402
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:20,149
pay attention to those trichomes get

403
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:22,640
yourself a scope they're gonna go clear

404
00:14:20,149 --> 00:14:24,169
then they're gonna turn silver then

405
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,759
they're gonna get cloudy that's when it

406
00:14:24,169 --> 00:14:27,289
starts getting excited their filter

407
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:29,629
that's getting exciting they're filling

408
00:14:27,289 --> 00:14:30,919
up with trichomes or with cannabinoids

409
00:14:29,629 --> 00:14:32,570
now they've got different things in

410
00:14:30,919 --> 00:14:34,519
their different psychoactive ingredients

411
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:36,649
inside of there that are changing every

412
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:38,569
day then they're gonna get milky they're

413
00:14:36,649 --> 00:14:39,769
gonna turn a little bit blue then

414
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:42,890
they're gonna look like I sprayed them

415
00:14:39,769 --> 00:14:44,750
with dr. pepper when 3 out of 10 when 30

416
00:14:42,889 --> 00:14:46,850
percent of them have that dr. pepper

417
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:51,049
stain on them that's when it's time to

418
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:54,500
cut so you're gonna say but it's my

419
00:14:51,049 --> 00:14:56,750
first grow with this plant how do I plan

420
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:59,198
that how do I properly be able to flush

421
00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:01,850
and look out for trichomes to be amber I

422
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:05,689
thought of a great way that we can all

423
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:06,980
be safe you keep in mind this isn't

424
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:08,390
gonna be the last time you're growing

425
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:09,589
the strain hopefully this is the first

426
00:15:08,389 --> 00:15:10,939
time you grew it that's why you don't

427
00:15:09,589 --> 00:15:12,079
know when the trichomes are gonna change

428
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:13,490
colors that's why you don't know how

429
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:14,929
long it's gonna take it's the first time

430
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:16,879
you're developing a relationship with

431
00:15:14,929 --> 00:15:18,859
this plant the first time you got to

432
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:20,389
learn it the second third time you dial

433
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:22,730
it in the fourth and fifth time you

434
00:15:20,389 --> 00:15:24,889
[ __ ] perfect this grow so you're just

435
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:25,850
learning this one so keep think about it

436
00:15:24,889 --> 00:15:28,250
this way

437
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:31,580
if you're growing a 60 day plant if the

438
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:33,860
package says grow it fir 55 to 60 days

439
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:34,580
go that 60 days if you're gonna go for

440
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:36,980
60 days

441
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:38,990
flush it day 50 and really start paying

442
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:40,580
attention to those trichomes if you want

443
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:42,529
to cut it down at a specific day just

444
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:45,980
make sure you flushed 7 to 10 days

445
00:15:42,529 --> 00:15:48,889
pretty heavily I'd like to go 14 but 7

446
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:51,050
to 10 days should be plenty if you want

447
00:15:48,889 --> 00:15:53,299
to let your plant go 70 days if you've

448
00:15:51,049 --> 00:15:55,490
got something I bred you probably want

449
00:15:53,299 --> 00:15:58,279
to let it go 70 days if I bred it 70

450
00:15:55,490 --> 00:16:00,500
days no problem start flushing at day 60

451
00:15:58,279 --> 00:16:02,449
and pay attention to your trichomes you

452
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,980
can cut down at day 70 if you don't feel

453
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:05,629
like it's ready let it go a little bit

454
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:07,190
longer it doesn't need nutrients to keep

455
00:16:05,629 --> 00:16:08,809
going it's just gonna start getting

456
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:12,830
tired but then you can give it time to

457
00:16:08,809 --> 00:16:15,379
ripen up so I think the way to judge

458
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:18,139
when to harvest your cannabis is by

459
00:16:15,379 --> 00:16:19,220
paying attention to the trichomes if you

460
00:16:18,139 --> 00:16:20,689
don't have a way to look at the

461
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:23,360
trichomes you don't have a way to

462
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:24,860
accurately judge the ripeness of your

463
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,110
cannabis plants and you run the risk of

464
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:28,730
cutting them way too early is what most

465
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:31,220
people do if you feel like they're done

466
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:33,350
wait three to five more days if you can

467
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:35,269
wait seven more days wait because

468
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:36,950
they're only gonna get better and don't

469
00:16:35,269 --> 00:16:40,819
cut too early because you're anxious and

470
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:42,830
eager patience patience you cut clones

471
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:44,600
or you grew from seeds and those took

472
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:45,889
time then you've edged it out you spent

473
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,639
a lot of money on nutrients you've

474
00:16:45,889 --> 00:16:48,559
already spent

475
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:51,409
you're probably gonna put a hundred and

476
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:53,479
fifteen days into it why not put 120 -

477
00:16:51,409 --> 00:16:55,009
what's another week right I know you

478
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,659
start getting itchy start getting that

479
00:16:55,009 --> 00:16:57,919
the crackhead lips and you start

480
00:16:56,659 --> 00:16:59,480
scratching your neck you're like yeah I

481
00:16:57,919 --> 00:17:00,769
want to cut it down I'm thinkin of a

482
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:03,110
friend of mine who was always in that

483
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:04,910
clip in lower nut he'd start at the

484
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:08,509
bottom of the plants or taking notes and

485
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:10,160
drying him out as fast as he could to

486
00:17:08,509 --> 00:17:12,319
keep himself covered and by the time we

487
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,509
got the harvest it was just like the top

488
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:16,159
coal is left on the plan yeah and then

489
00:17:14,509 --> 00:17:18,470
there's nothing to enjoy because you

490
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,449
fast ride everything and you could have

491
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:22,910
just had one huge harvest and actually

492
00:17:20,449 --> 00:17:25,100
seongjo as you can see what it looks

493
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:26,570
like what your work actually did instead

494
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:28,549
of just destroying your work slowly and

495
00:17:26,569 --> 00:17:30,349
not getting any reward yeah so be

496
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:32,089
patient you guys that's that's one of

497
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:33,859
the main things that it's hard to learn

498
00:17:32,089 --> 00:17:36,019
when you're growing cannabis sometimes

499
00:17:33,859 --> 00:17:37,939
you just need to hide your scissors send

500
00:17:36,019 --> 00:17:39,269
Mike home with the scissors but you see

501
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:41,190
that I can't cut my plan

502
00:17:39,269 --> 00:17:46,589
you're like you're on suicide watch or

503
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:47,909
something so I guess that was a pretty

504
00:17:46,589 --> 00:17:49,500
quick way to do it but I mean that's

505
00:17:47,909 --> 00:17:51,690
right to the point there's no other way

506
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:53,609
to explain that get a jeweler's loupe

507
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:55,740
get some sort of magnification and look

508
00:17:53,609 --> 00:18:00,000
at your trichomes I know I keep saying

509
00:17:55,740 --> 00:18:01,319
it we're growing for trichomes we you

510
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,419
just got to get in there with some

511
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:05,460
magnification and spend some time

512
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:07,110
reading the plan yeah we don't we're not

513
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:08,640
worried about all the green leafy part I

514
00:18:07,109 --> 00:18:10,079
mean that part tastes good that's fun to

515
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,580
smoke that's a cool carrier but the

516
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:13,859
trichomes are the goal so make sure

517
00:18:11,579 --> 00:18:17,629
they're ripe something that I should add

518
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:20,339
if you are growing for concentrates

519
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:22,169
maybe cut a little bit early start

520
00:18:20,339 --> 00:18:24,750
flushing early and harvest a little bit

521
00:18:22,169 --> 00:18:26,340
early because once the if you want nice

522
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:27,750
and clear concentrates maybe this is

523
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:28,740
some industry secrets secrets I

524
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:30,538
shouldn't be sharing with the general

525
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:32,519
public but here you go guys I love you

526
00:18:30,538 --> 00:18:34,048
and this is free if you want nice and

527
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:36,658
clear concentrates cut your plants down

528
00:18:34,048 --> 00:18:39,658
before the trichomes start getting dark

529
00:18:36,659 --> 00:18:41,250
if they start getting dark what you are

530
00:18:39,659 --> 00:18:43,470
extracting is trichomes your

531
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:44,940
concentrates will come out a little bit

532
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:46,890
darker cut them down when they're nice

533
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:48,899
and clear and guess what nice and clear

534
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:50,399
concentrates it's easier a lot of a lot

535
00:18:48,898 --> 00:18:52,019
of concentrate makers can make super

536
00:18:50,398 --> 00:18:54,000
clear concentrates out of everything now

537
00:18:52,019 --> 00:18:55,829
but it's easier it's less to clean up

538
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,960
it's less work if you're pulling it down

539
00:18:55,829 --> 00:19:00,210
when you have got nice and clear try

540
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:01,558
comes out early and process quickly yep

541
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:03,409
they cut them down I don't even want to

542
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:05,339
tell you what week sometimes like

543
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:06,840
sevenish I've seen it go their

544
00:19:05,339 --> 00:19:08,308
concentrates yeah a little bit

545
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:10,349
ridiculous but then you can pull a whole

546
00:19:08,308 --> 00:19:11,788
one more harvest a year if you cut

547
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:13,349
everything down at the end of week six

548
00:19:11,788 --> 00:19:16,558
but you could feel one more harvest a

549
00:19:13,349 --> 00:19:18,480
year in your schedule that's business

550
00:19:16,558 --> 00:19:21,028
unfortunately you guys do not do that be

551
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:24,870
patient let it go long enough let it be

552
00:19:21,028 --> 00:19:26,038
done like Axl Rose said all we need it's

553
00:19:24,869 --> 00:19:28,048
