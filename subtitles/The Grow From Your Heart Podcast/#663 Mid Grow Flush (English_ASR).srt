00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,680
bit of a social media break i was a

132
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,360
little bit overwhelmed with a lot of

133
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,959
stuff there was a lot of email happening

134
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,040
there was a lot of social media

135
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:54,719
interaction i'm on six or seven

136
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,639
different apps i produce a couple of

137
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,720
different podcast episodes every week i

138
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,560
do a live show i try to hang out with

139
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,039
friends and family and have a real life

140
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,280
outside of all this irie genetic stuff

141
00:05:03,038 --> 00:05:07,120
i did kind of take a little bit of a

142
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:08,799
break from social media i had to just

143
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,560
for uh not just for mental health

144
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,160
reasons but for real life reasons there

145
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,759
was other [ __ ] that had to be done right

146
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,360
now it is outdoor growth season there

147
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,800
may be some things happening outside

148
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,400
there may be some other things happening

149
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,840
since it's summertime

150
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:21,359
we're allowed to go outside and go to

151
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:23,839
events again i'm going to do as much of

152
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,160
that as i can but i am trying to get

153
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:27,279
back into the social media a little bit

154
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,960
more if you've been waiting for a

155
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:30,478
message reply if you've been waiting to

156
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:32,638
see me post or something it will be

157
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:34,800
happening more frequently may not be on

158
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,720
instagram it may not be on facebook but

159
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,879
you will see me more active on social

160
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,639
media again sometimes you got to step

161
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:42,719
back that's not even real

162
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,560
it's just everybody's just creating a

163
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,080
bubble on there that doesn't even really

164
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,839
exist so don't let it overwhelm you

165
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:49,680
don't let it get to you don't make it

166
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:52,399
become part of a job it is supposed to

167
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,000
be fun supposed to enjoy that i wasn't

168
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:55,758
enjoying it it was too much work it was

169
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,600
overwhelming uh when it got that

170
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,360
overwhelming i just gave up and signed

171
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,199
out when my account got deleted it was

172
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,360

the show i do like it you may notice i'm

227
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,759
using different artwork making different

228
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:47,759
intros stuff like that let's focus on

229
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,240
cannabis i did say i was going to talk

230
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,840
about flushing our plants i had a friend

231
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,879
say that he thought he messed up his

232
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:57,119
crop because he did not flush between

233
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,400
the veg phase and the flowering phase

234
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,879
and i was like there's no need to flush

235
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:02,239
then and he's like oh my friends tell me

236
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,919
that i have to flush and i think he

237
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,598
means the internet

238
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:07,598
the internet says that he has to flush

239
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:08,719
between the veg phase and the flower

240
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:10,639
phase and i said if you didn't do

241
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,560
anything wrong brother there's no reason

242
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,160
to flush during that phase and then he

243
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,280
said that he was taught that he should

244
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:19,599
flush often to fix problems and i think

245
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:21,758
that from what i have noticed in most

246
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:24,639
cases unless you've got a major major

247
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,800
major problem flushing usually just

248
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,319
causes more problems and we're going to

249
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,478
talk a little bit about flushing at the

250
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,479
end of the growth cycle flushing

251
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:35,199
pre-harvest a little bit but let's talk

252
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:37,440
a little bit about a mid grow flush and

253
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,200
a flush to solve problems i don't think

254
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,279
it's necessary

255
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,719
i think if you've got a problem so what

256
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:44,639
am i talking about let me kind of recap

257
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,080
what i'm even talking about if you see a

258
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:47,679
problem in your plants people will say

259
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,759
that they've got a problem we'll say

260
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:52,000
maybe a nutrient lockout or a nutrient

261
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:53,439
burn or an under some sort of problem

262
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,600
that they can't completely identify a

263
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,680
lot of people their first move is to

264
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,440
flush they will get a container of water

265
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:01,199
they will put the ph at whatever ph

266
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,200
they're used to using and they will just

267
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,040
over water the plant in an attempt to

268
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,360
wash everything out of the root zone and

269
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:10,240
start fresh

270
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:12,080
that's a good idea but

271
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,360
wouldn't it be a better idea in my

272
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,278
opinion

273
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,720
instead of rinsing out that root zone so

274
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:19,039
let's think about it the plants got a

275
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,959
problem then you're gonna just over

276
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:22,799
water it to where now it's over watered

277
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:23,919
now you got two problems and now your

278
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:25,919
third problem that you're going to

279
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:29,120
create is that it doesn't have any

280
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:30,639
nutrients in its root zone so now it's

281
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,799
got problem number one that we haven't

282
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:35,120
identified and we just panic flushed

283
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:36,958
number two now it's over water problem

284
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,200
number three now there's no nutrients in

285
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:41,278
there now whatever it was overdone or

286
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,200
deficient on that's definitely [ __ ]

287
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:44,559
because we just completely rinsed out

288
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,800
everything there's nothing in there it's

289
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:48,958
hungry it's freaking out so people

290
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:51,519
always say it had this problem i flushed

291
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:54,479
and now they're doing this i rarely hear

292
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:56,480
people say i had this problem i flushed

293
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,720
and i fixed it i don't hear that i get

294
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,480
more calls of saying dude i flushed them

295
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,000
they look like [ __ ] now now what do i do

296
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,759
and i say just let them dry out and feed

297
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,480
them properly and then they'll be back

298
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:09,278
on track so i think if you're going to

299
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,600
do a panic flush

300
00:10:09,278 --> 00:10:14,000
why not mix up a solid feed i call it

301
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,240
like a a triage feed or just a solid

302
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,320
diet or a good meal plan like if you

303
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,000
went to the if you went to the doctor

304
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,120
and you're like sick and you got some

305
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,559
problems first thing they're gonna do is

306
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,240
stick an iv in you and get you some

307
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:26,319
vitamins to get you hydrated let's do

308
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,159
that for the plant let's mix up a good

309
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,240
batch of nutrients what is your basic

310
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:31,838
feed what are you normally feeding this

311
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,360
plant you have nitrogen phosphorous

312
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,120
potassium do you have your calcium

313
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,039
magnesium do you have your basic

314
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,639
nutrients that these plants need do you

315
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:42,000
have some fulvic acid in there to help

316
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:43,919
them uptake do you have uh some carbs in

317
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,679
there uh do you have some microbes in

318
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:47,759
there do you have things in there to put

319
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:49,278
this plant in its top performance

320
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:51,519
whatever phase you're in if you're in

321
00:10:49,278 --> 00:10:54,399
veg if you're in flower ah mix up a

322
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,839
really nice mix some base nutrients some

323
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,200
calmag

324
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,519
some microbes i mentioned a bunch of

325
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:02,240
things get a good solid mix in there get

326
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:04,000
the ph adjusted perfectly and then water

327
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,000
that to run off now what you're going to

328
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,200
do you're going to rinse out all the old

329
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,559
[ __ ] that's in there it's going to fall

330
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,240
right out of the bottom as the plants

331
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:12,078
get run off and you're going to put a

332
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,320
brand new meal in there it's like

333
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:15,838
delivering [ __ ] soup in a sandwich to

334
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,360
a sick friend they've been eating

335
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,800
[ __ ] energy bars and drinking

336
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,480
gatorades all day because they've just

337
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:21,759
been sick and struggling that's what

338
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,959
your plant's been doing it's like i'm

339
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:24,720
[ __ ] i don't know what to do and you

340
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:27,359
just gave it soup and a sandwich and a

341
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,278
hug and that's really probably the best

342
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,639
you could do for it in my opinion so i

343
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:35,919
think like a mid grow or a mid cycle

344
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:38,879
flush is probably more detrimental than

345
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:41,919
it is uh helpful to our plants in most

346
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:44,159
cases now if you do have like a major

347
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:45,519
major major lockout or something maybe

348
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:48,399
you might want to flush and then at that

349
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,759
point uh just do plain water or maybe do

350
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:51,759
something there are plenty of flushing

351
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:53,838
products in there those are useful the

352
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:55,679
sugars in there do help unbind the salt

353
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,680
is what's happening in there that may

354
00:11:55,679 --> 00:12:00,638
work but

355
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:02,958
unless you've got major major issues i

356
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:06,480
don't think that flushing during the

357
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:07,838
growth cycle is a good idea a necessary

358
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,000
idea i think it's going to cause you

359
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,760
more problems you're going to over water

360
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,200
you're going to make the plants thirsty

361
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:14,799
and they already had one problem to

362
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,200
start with so you're just compounding

363
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:19,120
problems why not mix up something that

364
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,399
we know is good for the plants like when

365
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,159
people are sick you don't just give them

366
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,679
a bunch of water and hope that they just

367
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:25,519
pee everything out you got to give them

368
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:27,359
nutrients in a meal also like i said

369
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,519
bring them soup in a sandwich maybe a

370
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,360
multivitamin maybe a kombucha to get

371
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:33,120
some probiotics in them you got to take

372
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,519
care of them the plants are the same way

373
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,360
we got to take care of the plants so um

374
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,919
i keep repeating myself that mid-cycle

375
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,680
flush might be kind of silly most of

376
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:45,679
what i've been talking about so far

377
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:47,679
applies to a soilless mix type of a grow

378
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:49,439
maybe you're using fox farms or some

379
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:50,799
soil like that that's what this would

380
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,279
apply to something with bottled

381
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:55,278
nutrients that type of environment let's

382
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:57,200
talk a little bit about hydro and

383
00:12:55,278 --> 00:12:58,958
flushing now i don't think it's

384
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,360
necessary to flush

385
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:04,078
your grow mid grow your plants mid grow

386
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,320
with a hydroponic system i think that is

387
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:08,319
a missed opportunity for a feed if

388
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,800
you've got a big problem if you see

389
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,639
something is completely off in any case

390
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:14,639
the first case of the first step the

391
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,799
first thing to do is identify the

392
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:19,039
deficiency or the over feed or the

393
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:21,759
toxicity or whatever the problem is your

394
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:23,919
first step is to identify that then like

395
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:25,759
i said before mix up that proper feed if

396
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:27,278
you know what's off correct that if you

397
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:28,879
know what you're giving too much of

398
00:13:27,278 --> 00:13:30,480
don't feed it that this time if you've

399
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:32,480
given it too little of something add

400
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,079
some of that this time but adjust your

401
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,000
nutrients and then get that in the

402
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:37,679
reservoir and get it fed to the plants i

403
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
don't like to run a lot of plain water

404
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:41,198
through a hydro system and not feed the

405
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,679
plants the reason we're doing

406
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:45,679
hydroponics is to get as many feeds as

407
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:47,679
possible to kind of beef up those plants

408
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:49,359
and get as many nutrients into it so

409
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:50,879
we're missing an opportunity to feed

410
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,278
them we should just mix up the feed that

411
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:56,480
they need and get it to them every time

412
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:58,799
instead of doing just plain water so the

413
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:01,278
first step in any case to solving a

414
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:03,838
nutrient issue whether it's over or

415
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:05,600
under feed is to identify the problem

416
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,920
what nutrient are we missing and a lot

417
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,079
of times it is two nutrients working

418
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:12,000
together or against each other you'll

419
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:13,679
notice if you over feed one thing you'll

420
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,360
see a problem with another if you under

421
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:16,958
feed one thing you'll see a problem with

422
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,199
a different nutrient they work in

423
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:20,799
balance together so pay close attention

424
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:23,198
keep good notes of everything that you

425
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:25,759
fed keep good notes of your ph keep good

426
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:28,319
notes of your ec you may even want to

427
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:30,000
measure the ec and ph going in and

428
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,079
coming out of your plants if you've got

429
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,320
that ability that will help us diagnose

430
00:14:32,078 --> 00:14:37,198
a problem and then adjust to make

431
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,800
corrections especially in a hydroponic

432
00:14:37,198 --> 00:14:40,958
system it's a little bit harder in a

433
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:42,719
soilless mix because you got all that

434
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:44,799
soilless stuff in there you're going to

435
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,320
get a lot of ppms of different things

436
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:48,799
but we know exactly what we're putting

437
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:51,120
in in a hydroponic mix let me read my

438
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:53,838
notes and see where i am

439
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:56,480
um identify the problem mix up a good

440
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:58,240
feed um yeah why would you starve the

441
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,680
plants you could just water them but why

442
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,278
would you do that now you're gonna make

443
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:03,039
them hungry also that's like telling a

444
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:04,399
sick person like starve for a day and

445
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:05,838
then i'll try to figure out what's wrong

446
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,519
with you and then we'll diagnose it and

447
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,600
then we'll [ __ ] fix you

448
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:11,519
no no don't make them feed

449
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,159
mix up a solid feed with the appropriate

450
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:15,440
things uh just at the appropriate ph for

451
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:17,439
your time in the grow and what your

452
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,199
garden is used to make sure the ph is

453
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,680
right also make sure that your ph pen is

454
00:15:19,198 --> 00:15:23,439
correct i saw somebody that has been

455
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:25,359
adjusting their ph with the pen that has

456
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,040
been miscalibrated for quite a while so

457
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,600
everything looked like [ __ ] we thought

458
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:31,519
the ph was correct the pen was off so it

459
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,680
was not everything was way off make sure

460
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,360
your pins are good then reset that soil

461
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:36,958
with the good feed when you just water

462
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,800
everything into that soil with that good

463
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:40,638
nutrient mix with the good ph balance

464
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:42,399
you just kind of reset that soil those

465
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,600
plants will start drinking all of that

466
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,159
they'll get more active and they'll

467
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,000
start recovering you're not going to see

468
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:49,600
the burn and stuff is not going to go

469
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,879
away if you've got crispy leaves and

470
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,959
crinkled up [ __ ] like that it's not

471
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:55,360
going to go away but the new growth

472
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:56,479
won't be as terrible and beat up but

473
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,480
you're not going to get rid of some of

474
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,639
that don't be afraid to pull off some of

475
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,639
those crispy bad dead funky ugly leaves

476
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,879
those do invite more problems

477
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:07,440
the bugs kind of see those yellow leaves

478
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:09,278
as weakness the spider mites that's why

479
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,199
we use the yellow sticky traps because

480
00:16:09,278 --> 00:16:13,120
the bugs like spider mites and things

481
00:16:11,198 --> 00:16:14,958
like that see the yellow and they say

482
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,000
that plant should be green but it's

483
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:17,439
yellow so that means that little

484
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,720
protective layer on the outside is

485
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,839
probably good and weak i can get in

486
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,759
there and start munching and get the

487
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:24,480
plant juices out of this so get those

488
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,839
yellow funky ugly crinkly crusty dry

489
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,199
leaves out of there if you've got them

490
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:29,360
try to keep all the green healthy

491
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:31,519
foliage around save that rescue that

492
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,839
focus on the new stuff coming

493
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:36,639
now let's talk about something

494
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:39,040
a little bit controversial that honestly

495
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,480
this is all bro science i do not have

496
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:43,439
any science behind this i'm going to

497
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:46,240
tell you the honest truth i am debating

498
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:48,480
and readjusting and rethinking my stance

499
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,560
on flushing our cannabis plants i don't

500
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,519
have enough real scientific data i don't

501
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:56,719
have the scientific machines to do this

502
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:58,639
all i can tell you is by uh burning it

503
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,040
by smoking it by consuming it by

504
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:02,720
extracting it by enjoying it or not

505
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:04,798
enjoying it that's the only testing that

506
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:08,078
i've got and that's kind of what matters

507
00:17:04,798 --> 00:17:09,918
because um yeah i've never had some lab

508
00:17:08,078 --> 00:17:12,240
equipment tell me that my weed was good

509
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:14,559
or bad so um

510
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,959
let's talk about flushing flushing and

511
00:17:14,558 --> 00:17:18,720
this is the end of harvest or the end of

512
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,240
the cycle pre-harvest flushing we've

513
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,400
been feeding our plants for nine weeks

514
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:25,199
we're gonna cut down i used to preach

515
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:27,679
the flush for 10 to 14 days is that

516
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:29,519
necessary i don't know there's a lot of

517
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:32,080
debate in that my question is what do we

518
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:34,879
think we're flushing out like there's a

519
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:36,639
plant and there are buds and nutrients

520
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,799
have been put into that plant and

521
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:41,600
they've been photosynthesized or

522
00:17:38,798 --> 00:17:44,639
metabolized and turned into plant they

523
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:46,079
are fibers and terpenes and there's a

524
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,160
bunch of different components to that

525
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:50,639
plant now there plant waxes and esters

526
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,960
and uh all the different components of a

527
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,160
plant they became a plant there's not

528
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,200
like

529
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,120
little

530
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,640
nutrients and they are but they're the

531
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:01,839
building blocks of the plant what are we

532
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:03,759
gonna flush out i don't know like

533
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:05,199
when you pee do you like do you think

534
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:06,640
you pee so

535
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,720
i i don't know what we're gonna flush

536
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,400
out i really don't know because i pee

537
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,200
out waste but the building blocks of the

538
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:15,600
food that i ate still created me i like

539
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,919
my waste comes out but the the things

540
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:19,918
that i ate and consumed that created me

541
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:22,000
are still here you're not gonna flush a

542
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:24,080
lot of that out so if you were to

543
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,319
consume me

544
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:27,918
you would only you would the

545
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:30,319
the waste is all that's coming out of me

546
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:32,000
so i think even when we flush i i see

547
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:33,759
that's and i don't have enough science

548
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,240
behind it that's my thought process on

549
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:38,879
it uh i'm open to feedback i would love

550
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,480
to hear your uh opinions your bro

551
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,520
science i'd love to read your paperwork

552
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:45,440
on it again i have grown for a lot of

553
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:48,000
time in a lot of environments with a lot

554
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:50,000
of different mediums sometimes i've had

555
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,599
the opportunity to flush for two weeks

556
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,599
sometimes we've had emergencies where

557
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:55,038
plants didn't get to get flushed as much

558
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:57,199
sometimes i notice a difference

559
00:18:55,038 --> 00:18:58,879
sometimes i don't sometimes i also

560
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:02,640
notice that the dry and cure really had

561
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:04,720
a lot to do with it so i am not sure um

562
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,559
is that white ash really telling me that

563
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,640
it was flushed properly is the flush the

564
00:19:06,558 --> 00:19:10,079
right thing i do notice that if we over

565
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,520
feed the stuff doesn't burn right

566
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:13,439
sometimes if you over feed certain

567
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:15,679
things it doesn't burn right but is

568
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,679
flushing real i really don't know i'm

569
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:19,120
still adjusting my approach to that

570
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:21,519
whole thought process but i want to know

571
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:24,000
what are we flushing out like what do we

572
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:25,038
actually think is coming out of the

573
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,200
plant

574
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:29,359
i don't know ladies and gentlemen boys

575

this may be a quick show i'm not sure

581
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:41,840
how long we've been going either way it

582
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:43,839
is quality over quantity right i could

583
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:45,839
ramble on and make this show longer but

584
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:47,678
we got a quick talk about flushing we

585
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:49,279
got to talk about uh the discord and

586
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:50,880
stuff at the top of the show i want to
