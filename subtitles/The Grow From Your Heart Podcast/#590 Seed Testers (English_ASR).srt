00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:10,719
as a breeder

72
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,680
i breed new creations and i need help

73
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:13,680
testing those

74
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,280
to make their make sure they qualify for

75
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,640
the market before we put them out for

76
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,400
everybody to play with

77
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:19,759
so i create a bunch of new things i put

78
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,520
my male plant in the room

79
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:23,359
i let him pollinate a bunch of familiar

80
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,159
females so i can replenish my stock for

81
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,599
the market

82
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:27,280
while i'm at it i'll throw in a couple

83
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:28,799
of new females in there

84
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,800
then i don't know what those females are

85
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,239
gonna make so i'll grow a few of them

86
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,920
out myself to make sure they're

87
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,239
good quality make sure they pass my

88
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:37,919
standards but as the breeder

89
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,439
they better pass my standards right i

90
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:40,479
know what the mom plant was i know what

91
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:42,000
the dad plant was

92
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:43,039
i know all the ingredients to the pie i

93
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,318
should know how to bake the pie

94
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:46,079
perfectly at that point

95
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:47,839
they better come out good for me

96
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,599
sometimes they don't i throw all those

97
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,360
away if they don't pass my germination

98
00:02:49,598 --> 00:02:54,159
expectations if they don't grow well for

99
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,319
me if this doesn't reach my overall goal

100
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:58,479
i will throw the seeds away if they do

101
00:02:56,318 --> 00:03:00,079
reach my expectations reach my goal my

102
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:02,318
next step is to send them out to

103
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,760
testers so that other growers can grow

104
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:05,199
them i'm going to talk about what i

105
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:06,560
expect from the testers

106
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:08,560
who the testers are we're going to talk

107
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,640
a lot about that so let's just get right

108
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,239
into it tester expectations

109
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:14,000
how do i choose testers that's what

110
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,640
people ask me the most how can i be a

111
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,959
tester

112
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:18,318
how do you choose the testers testers

113
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,759
are chosen i've got a lot of notes here

114
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:21,518
so excuse me if i don't stare into the

115
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:22,560
camera a lot this time i've got a lot of

116
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,000
notes we're going to try to stay a

117
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,799
little bit focused today

118
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,519
um tester expectations uh testers are

119
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,319
chosen

120
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:32,239
from social media uh forums and from

121
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:33,439
mainly my gang of misfit friends i've

122
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,120
got a little group of friends that i

123
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:36,639
hang out with i grow with

124
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,319
if they get first dibs at the seeds if

125
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:40,318
you're local and i can go see your grow

126
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:42,158
i can take pictures of your grill myself

127
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:44,639
i really prefer that you get the seeds

128
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:46,318
first so my local group of misfit grower

129
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:48,000
friends get the seeds first

130
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:51,039
then the social media people will get

131
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,039
seeds after that uh instagram cano buzz

132
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:54,318
some of the forums uh definitely my

133
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:55,679
patreon supporters

134
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:57,280
definitely getting moved up when it's

135
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,239
time for testers i think of them because

136
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,360
they are definitely

137
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,959
they're serious about it they're

138
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,080
contributing they're listening to the

139
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,878
show so i know they're going to do it

140
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,879
correctly

141
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:06,239
especially after this episode and

142
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:07,679
they're serious about it that's the

143
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,560
bottom line they're doing it correctly

144
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,080
because they're serious and they're

145
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,438
doing the roster jeff method

146
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,719
so i trust they're going to grow these

147
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:15,199
seeds in a great way and it's going to

148
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:17,680
be reliable so the testers come

149
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:19,439
from social media forums and my friends

150
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,040
i choose testers for a few

151
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:23,040
different reasons and with a few

152
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,240
different criteria in mind i don't need

153
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,840
the same

154
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,439
thing from every tester that's why i

155
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:30,159
choose different testers

156
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:31,519
um the first goal of outside testing is

157
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,639
to see what i've created i've talked

158
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:34,000
about that

159
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,360
i know what to expect in my growths i

160
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,639
know the parents i've talked about that

161
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,919
where are we in these notes i skipped

162
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,918
some stuff oh

163
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:41,680
so when when i'm sending these out i

164
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:44,639
need growers of different skill sets

165
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,000
growing in different varieties of rooms

166
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,639
different types of nutrients different

167
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,839
mediums

168
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,800
different lighting that's the word that

169
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:50,239
wouldn't come into my head and i'm

170
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,000
looking right into these bright lights

171
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,680
i need people growing under led lights

172
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,279
hps lights cm edge

173
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,120
lights all the different kind of stuff i

174
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:57,599
want to see what my new plants do under

175
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,360
there

176
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,120
so my goal is to see how these plants

177
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,720
react in your environment in different

178
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,560
growers environments

179
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,919
i expect some of you guys to abuse them

180
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,160
i expect some of you guys to

181
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:09,918
treat them beautifully i expect some of

182
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,439
the rooms to not be perfect i hope

183
00:05:09,918 --> 00:05:12,000
somebody gets spider mites in the middle

184
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:13,439
of the grow

185
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,879
i'm not hoping you do i hope somebody

186
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:16,719
else gets spider mites in the middle of

187
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:18,399
the grow while they're testing my seeds

188
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,000
that way we can find out how these

189
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:21,120
plants react to spider mites are they

190
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,199
mite resistant

191
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,560
are they gonna get invaded with mites if

192
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,240
you've got four different plants in the

193
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,759
room does one specific strain

194
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,280
get attracted to the mind do the mites

195
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,400
love that one that's the kind of [ __ ]

196
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:31,918
that i want to see

197
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:34,000
then when you're growing them i want to

198
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:34,478
see if you see any issues are the plants

199
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,959
just

200
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:38,719
sloppy and shitty did we make a bunch of

201
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:40,319
problematic plants are there any inner

202
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,639
sex traits that's one of the things we

203
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:44,478
are really looking for intersex traits

204
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,400
if the plants throw nanners if they're

205
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:47,918
intersex at all i want to get rid of

206
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:48,959
those in my opinion those aren't good to

207
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:51,038
give out as a breeder

208
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:52,319
i'm gonna not pass that seedline on if

209
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:54,240
we get a bunch of intersex

210
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:55,680
plants did i make a bunch of mutants

211
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,120
that's always an option

212
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,400
when you're playing with genetics two

213
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,959
plants that come from different parts of

214
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:01,279
the world

215
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:02,399
or nowadays two [ __ ] polyhybrid

216
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:03,599
plants that have just been

217
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:04,879
bred from things that have been bred

218
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,560
from other things that not a lot of

219
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:08,000
thought may have been put into and

220
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,600
i got a hold of them now and i like the

221
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,279
plant so i'm breeding with it

222
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,120
i've got the opportunity to make a bunch

223
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:14,159
of shitty mutants and i have i've thrown

224
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,840
those seeds away

225
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,680
but we've got to test them and find out

226
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:19,279
if we grow mutants maybe under my lights

227
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,759
they grew beautifully maybe under your

228
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:21,198
light

229
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,199
they express some weird [ __ ] that

230
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,639
phenotypical expression may be different

231
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:27,439
in your environment

232
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,400
my main goal is to make winners that

233
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:30,478
outperform

234
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:31,758
both parents so i've got a female plant

235
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:33,279
and i say oh there's traits to that

236
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,879
female that i really like and i've got a

237
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:36,559
couple of males to choose from

238
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:38,159
i also can reverse things so i can see a

239
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,160
lot of different opportunities

240
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,160
my goal is to make something better than

241
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,000
both parents if i don't make something

242
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,600
better than both parents i don't feel

243
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,839
like i should pass it on to you

244
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,439
there's already a bunch of level eights

245
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:51,918
so i take two level eights and i try to

246
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:53,120
make a level 10 or an 11 or 12.

247
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:55,439
if i don't come out with at least a

248
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,800
solid 9.5 i don't pass it on we don't

249
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:58,399
even play with it so

250
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,960
i feel like everything that i do put out

251
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:02,638
is a solid 9.5 at least a 10

252
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:04,959
i'm aiming for 11's everybody wants

253
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,478
those 12s but let's be realistic so

254
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:08,159
i'm looking for [ __ ] that outperforms

255
00:07:06,478 --> 00:07:10,000
the parents and i'm hoping that i see

256
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,520
that in your garden not just in mine

257
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,879
like i said before in my garden it's

258
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:14,478
really easy to see

259
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:16,240
what these plants are gonna do i can

260
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:17,758
predict it i know that when i put

261
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,280
red and blue together i should get

262
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,960
purple and if i add a little bit more

263
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:22,239
red i'm going to get more reddish purple

264
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:22,959
i don't know the tone that that's going

265
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,160
to be but

266
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:26,159
you know what i'm saying it's like being

267
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,680
a chef if i know i've worked with these

268
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,199
ingredients so many times i know how to

269
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,280
put them together and make it work so i

270
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,199
should know how to run these plants

271
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:35,119
let me keep going with testing so what i

272
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,560
expect from you what i'm doing what i'm

273
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,918
asking from you is to let me know what

274
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,360
these plants are doing

275
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:42,079
how do they work in your environment and

276
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:45,199
your grow style in your media

277
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:47,680
in exchange you get super cool

278
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,199
new free seeds not a lot of people get

279
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,800
testers i mean plenty of people get them

280
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,520
but if you think about the overall seed

281
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,199
market

282
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:54,560
not a lot of people get these testers

283
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,800
right away you've got the first

284
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,160
drop of brand new [ __ ] nobody else

285
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,280
around you is going to have it hopefully

286
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,479
only one or two people in your

287
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:01,839
neighborhood got these

288
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:03,598
one or two people in your group you can

289
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:05,119
kind of i encourage people to show off

290
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:05,598
my testers too so that gives you a whole

291
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,439
new

292
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:08,878
some instagram clout some [ __ ] to show

293
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:10,959
off so let's talk about

294
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,560
who i need as testers let me get myself

295
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:14,799
back on track on my notes here

296
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,079
who who do i need as testers i need

297
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,680
photographers

298
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:20,079
a lot of what i'm doing with testers is

299
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,680
i'm looking for photos to put on my

300
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:23,519
website for advertising

301
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,680
i put them on my website they end up on

302
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:27,120
seeds here now seeds

303
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,199
they end up on all the other vendor

304
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,319
websites so that you can see what the

305
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,919
plants look like

306
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:33,839
and i want multiple people to take

307
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:35,038
photos so we can get a realistic view of

308
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,839
the phenotypes

309
00:08:35,038 --> 00:08:38,799
the bud structures the plant structures

310
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,279
i could take

311
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:42,879
the picture of the single finest plant

312
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:43,679
out of a batch of a thousand seeds i

313
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:45,120
could grow them

314
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,958
i could spend all year just growing

315
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,480
seeds of one strain and find the perfect

316
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:49,919
plant and take pictures of that

317
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,159
i could post it and i could say that's

318
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:53,679
the most beautiful picture of

319
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:55,360
lady marmalade or whatever strain we

320
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:56,719
want to use in his example i could say

321
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,759
that's the most beautiful picture ever

322
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,720
that's what you're going to expect

323
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:00,879
that's not cool

324
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,920
i should pick a realistic example of the

325
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:03,600
plants by letting

326
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:05,599
other people post the photos and share

327
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,320
the photos it's very realistic they're

328
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,320
getting it

329
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,839
i didn't send them specially selected

330
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,360
seeds i sent them seeds right out of the

331
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,040
batch that will go out for

332
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,399
everybody else if the seeds do pass

333
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:16,240
testing so

334
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,759
that's realistic i want photographers

335
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,399
they could take good photos of these

336
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:20,319
plants

337
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:21,759
i'm able to take the best photos like i

338
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,440
said they're my plants i've got

339
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:24,879
basically unlimited seeds so i could

340
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,720
just grow as many of those seeds as i

341
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:28,080
want until i find the perfect photo

342
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,000
and then post that one up and say that's

343
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,600
my prized photo but that's not fair i

344
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,799
want you to see what's really coming out

345
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,720
of these plants so

346
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:36,319
i want photographers i need website and

347
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,839
advertising photos

348
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:41,839
i need new growers who will

349
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,920
grow the plants they're full new growers

350
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:45,760
who grow their plants their full ability

351
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:46,319
but also kind of abuse the plants i've

352
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:48,319
got some

353
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,160
staggered notes here growers that are

354
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,519
going to slightly abuse the plants are

355
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:52,958
also the growers who are going to be

356
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,320
buying these seeds so

357
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:55,518
if you're a new grower and you're going

358
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,040
to kind of abuse them but you're going

359
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,720
to try your best but you're going to

360
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:00,879
accidentally make mistakes

361
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,639
i like that because then i find if the

362
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:03,600
plants can handle stress can they handle

363
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:05,199
problems

364
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,800
can they handle resistance like i said

365
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,240
people are going to get powdery mildew

366
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:09,519
and spider mites it's often those new

367
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,320
growers that struggle with that and

368
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,320
we'll find out

369
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,160
how these plants react to that those

370
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,040
stressful situations are also where

371
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:17,759
we're going to find

372
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:18,559
intersex plants my environments are nice

373
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:20,240
i'm not gonna

374
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:22,078
find a lot of intersex problems here

375
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,360
unless i ask for it if i go messing with

376
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:25,919
the light cycles and [ __ ]

377
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,680
then i see weird things but my rooms are

378
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:29,120
great my environment my temperature

379
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:30,479
anywhere i work anywhere i've got a

380
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,480
plant i've got a lot of equipment where

381
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,240
it stays nice unless the power goes out

382
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,519
we've talked about that before but i'm

383
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,480
not going to see those problems you're

384
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,320
going to see them

385
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,320
in those weird rooms so i need

386
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,160
photographers i need new growers

387
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,079
who will try their best but may

388
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:46,639
accidentally cause some problems then

389
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:47,199
i need pro growers as well uh pro

390
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:48,639
growers

391
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,320
are going to push these plants to their

392
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:51,919
full potential we're going to see the

393
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,800
potential harvest weight the potential

394
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:54,319
potency

395
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:56,399
then i want people to can get them

396
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,399
tested if you can get them lab tested

397
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,078
in a lab the finished product that's one

398
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,639
of my favorite things so

399
00:11:00,078 --> 00:11:04,639
new growers pro growers photographers

400
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:06,958
people enthusiastic about cannabis

401
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:08,639
and then people who can follow

402
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:09,838
instructions one of the things i really

403
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:11,759
need is people that can follow

404
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,519
instructions and communicate with me on

405
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:14,000
at least a weekly basis we're going to

406
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,000
talk a lot

407
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,320
about that in this episode the

408
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,078
communication that i expect

409
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,519
one thing that i should say is i'm not

410
00:11:20,078 --> 00:11:23,278
looking for people who want

411
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,759
free seeds people who want to give me a

412
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:27,039
shout out on social media for free seeds

413
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:28,799
what i'm looking for is people are going

414
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:29,919
to test these seeds under the criteria

415
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:31,838
that i'm asking for

416
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:33,120
i'll give a pretty clear criteria and

417
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,480
that's what i'm looking for i want to

418
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,159
establish growers

419
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,839
that have got a routine or a new grower

420
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:39,278
who's trying to develop a routine

421
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,880
some sort of system not a bunch of

422
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:42,078
experimental stuff

423
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:44,078
that's who i'm looking for now let's

424
00:11:42,078 --> 00:11:47,199
talk about what i expect from a tester

425
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:49,199
what do i expect i expect quick grows

426
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,480
some people want to get and this is cool

427
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,680
if that's your way to do it but when you

428
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,200
first get a seed

429
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:54,879
and you grow that seed you don't know if

430
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,079
it's going to be a male or a female

431
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:57,278
you don't know if it's going to be a

432
00:11:56,078 --> 00:11:58,559
mutant you don't know if it's going to

433
00:11:57,278 --> 00:12:00,000
be intersex you don't know if it's going

434
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:02,479
to be [ __ ] completely

435
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,159
i could be hemp it could just anything

436
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,720
even if i bread it it could still be

437
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:06,639
terrible

438
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,320
you never you're taking a gamble with

439
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,480
genetics so

440
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,399
i want quicker grows i see people grow

441
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,759
these giant plants they start off

442
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,360
they just grow this brand new seed and

443
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:17,759
they grow in a seven gallon pot and grow

444
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,079
at five feet tall and top it eight times

445
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:21,120
bro what if it's a male uh we don't even

446
00:12:20,078 --> 00:12:23,120
know if that's a boy

447
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,879
settle down so i want quick grows these

448
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,360
are tester plants i want you to test

449
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:26,799
them

450
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,480
don't play with them don't spend a lot

451
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:30,078
of time get them in there turn them and

452
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,680
burn them is what i say

453
00:12:30,078 --> 00:12:32,958
don't grow them out and waste your time

454
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:33,599
in your space i don't know if they're

455
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:35,119
any good

456
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,519
i don't want you to waste your time in

457
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,159
space don't excessively top them and

458
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,679
train them

459
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:41,360
don't spread them out and do weird [ __ ]

460
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:42,958
to them maybe get them big enough to

461
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,759
where you can take one maybe three

462
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:45,278
clones

463
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:47,039
if you really want to take the top if

464
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:48,480
that's your style take the top out take

465
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:50,719
two clones off the bottom

466
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,039
as soon as you see roots on those clones

467
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,800
start flowering it that's what i expect

468
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:56,399
a lot of times i don't even take a clone

469
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:58,479
off of a tester because

470
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,759
if it's that good we can re-veg it and

471
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,360
if you really get something that's

472
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:02,879
amazing and you didn't take a clone from

473
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,639
a tester it's most likely that i will

474
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:06,320
send you another pack of seeds you can

475
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,720
find that phenotype again

476
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,320
so maybe do one top to get the shape you

477
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,320
need but don't go crazy

478
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,760
the goal is to see what we've got we

479
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,680
just want to grow them out see what they

480
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:17,200
do if you go topping and manipulating it

481
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:18,799
and training it and twisting it

482
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,320
it's going to do different [ __ ] than it

483
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:20,719
normally would do if you just let it

484
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,320
grow

485
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,959
let it grow i want to see what these

486
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,879
plants do almost be kind of scientific

487
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:30,078
don't do any experimental [ __ ]

488
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:31,519
use a familiar feed and a familiar light

489
00:13:30,078 --> 00:13:33,599
if you're an established grower

490
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,200
don't change anything don't swap for

491
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,879
these i'm going to try using this plasma

492
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,240
light don't do that dude do the same

493
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:39,919
light you've been doing forever so that

494
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,198
you know what you're looking for no

495
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:43,360
variables this time

496
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:44,958
the only variables should be my seeds

497
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,120
that's the variable in here

498
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:49,039
then here's something i really asked for

499
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,399
when you were running testers

500
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:52,159
when we talk about it we'll have a

501
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:54,078
conversation before you get seeds we'll

502
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:56,240
email we'll talk on social media

503
00:13:54,078 --> 00:13:58,078
we're going to talk about it we will

504
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,799
establish how many seeds are going to be

505
00:13:58,078 --> 00:14:01,838
sent

506
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:03,278
i prefer you to run all of those seeds

507
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:05,040
at one time

508
00:14:03,278 --> 00:14:07,278
pop them all at the same time do the

509
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:09,679
same thing to every single one of them

510
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:11,679
if you get 10 seeds germinate the 10

511
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:13,679
seeds in your germination method

512
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:15,759
grow them your way transplant them your

513
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:16,000
way but do the same thing to all 10 of

514
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:18,480
them

515
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,198
this is a scientific approach do the

516
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,199
same thing

517
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:23,519
please um also when you go doing things

518
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:25,278
if

519
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:27,039
not just run them all the same time do

520
00:14:25,278 --> 00:14:28,480
the same thing everything i keep saying

521
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:30,078
that but that's important

522
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,759
like transplant them at the same time if

523
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:33,759
you put recharge on one of them put

524
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:34,639
recharge on 10 of them don't do recharge

525
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:37,039
on half

526
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:38,879
don't top half of them don't [ __ ] do

527
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:40,799
please do the same thing to all 10 of

528
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:43,919
your seeds if you get six do it to all

529
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:45,359
six uh this is scientific so maybe one

530
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:46,958
phenotype is gonna grow tall and

531
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,159
stretchy one will grow short and bushy

532
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:50,239
one is gonna grow

533
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:51,679
wide how are we gonna know that if you

534
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,039
top them all excessively

535
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:54,719
how are we gonna know the difference if

536
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:55,198
you fed one a bunch of recharge and

537
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,639
didn't

538
00:14:55,198 --> 00:14:58,319
feed this one recharge the one with

539
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,959
recharge is obviously going to root out

540
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,399
harder

541
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:02,479
do more [ __ ] so it's not going to be a

542
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,839
fair test we want a fair fight here

543
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,759
we're looking for the winners

544
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,440
we're looking to see what we've got so

545
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:08,319
give them all the same thing the same

546
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,040
environment

547
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,399
keep it scientific ah then i can't

548
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:13,919
release the seeds until

549
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:16,240
they have been tested thoroughly by

550
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:18,240
myself and by my testing team and

551
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,799
hopefully that is you so i'm relying on

552
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,198
you

553
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:22,159
to test them take pictures of them give

554
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:23,759
me reports

555
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:25,198
so that we can get them to the market to

556
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:26,879
the other people who've been watching

557
00:15:25,198 --> 00:15:28,639
your photos who've been drooling over

558
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:30,078
them because i don't put anything out

559
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:31,680
until it is thoroughly tested it

560
00:15:30,078 --> 00:15:33,120
frustrates the [ __ ] out of people

561
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:34,719
they see you running testers and like

562
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,000
come on i want that i want that

563
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,600
and i'm like i'm waiting for three more

564
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,198
people to give me results once i got 10

565
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,278
people that say they were hot fire

566
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:42,240
and zero reports of [ __ ] they'll come

567
00:15:41,278 --> 00:15:44,559
out so

568
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,519
do it kind of quickly please if you do a

569
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:47,838
good job

570
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,560
you become already added to the list of

571
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,639
potential

572
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:52,159
testers in the future if you do a good

573
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,079
job with this round of testers

574
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:55,600
the next time i need testers i don't

575
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:57,198
even send out the email i go well let's

576
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,600
find 10 people from this one and send it

577
00:15:57,198 --> 00:15:59,359
to them

578
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,800
first you get the first batch the

579
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,560
testers go out in waves

580
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:04,479
i let people get them in veg get them go

581
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:05,838
and i send out more i go drop off

582
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,199
testers at friends houses

583
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,399
they go out in waves shipping shipping's

584
00:16:07,198 --> 00:16:09,838
kind of expensive i do it all on

585
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,120
priority mail it's also hard to keep up

586
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:11,839
with everybody when you do it all at

587
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,278
once so

588
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:14,720
i do them in little waves in little

589
00:16:13,278 --> 00:16:16,480
groups and i can remember group one got

590
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,759
this group two got this

591
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,000
so if you do a really good job and you

592
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:22,560
didn't keep clones like i said before

593
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
you may get more seeds you may get a pe

594
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:25,278
i'll give you more [ __ ] if you tested

595
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,078
stuff and you ran out and you didn't

596
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:27,919
keep a clone

597
00:16:26,078 --> 00:16:29,120
i'll give you more seeds but i'd prefer

598
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:32,000
to give you new [ __ ] so

599
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,440
just expect new [ __ ] from me so now i

600
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,799
keep saying i want

601
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,480
excuse me i'm not even gonna edit that i

602
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:38,240
feel like i'm flowing

603
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,519
take a drink of water keep going i keep

604
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,440
saying there are a lot of things i want

605
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,320
you to report back to me and communicate

606
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,519
with me on

607
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,759
here are a lot of the things i want you

608
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:47,679
to take notes on and communicate to me i

609
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:50,079
expect weekly communication

610
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:51,120
send me pictures weekly even in veg i

611
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:52,559
want to know what they look like when

612
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,000
they're little itty babies i want to see

613
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:56,159
my babies as they grow up

614
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,440
so send me germination pictures how many

615
00:16:56,159 --> 00:16:59,519
seeds germinated

616
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,199
how many looked like [ __ ] how many did

617
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,399
you get let me know how many you got so

618
00:17:01,198 --> 00:17:04,240
we can know the ratio if you got

619
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,838
100 seeds and four did not germinate

620
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,880
that's not bad numbers if you got five

621
00:17:05,838 --> 00:17:08,078
and four didn't germinate

622
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,079
we got to throw those seeds away or

623
00:17:08,078 --> 00:17:11,438
figure out what you did wrong so here

624
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:13,519
are some of the things that i want you

625
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:14,558
to communicate with me and take detailed

626
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:15,918
notes on

627
00:17:14,558 --> 00:17:18,160
all right so when you start emailing me

628
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:19,919
or sending me your test strain report

629
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,919
always include what strain you are

630
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,439
growing i try to stay on top of it know

631
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,799
who's got what but i've got multiple

632
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:27,038
testers out there right now

633
00:17:24,798 --> 00:17:29,038
so please remind me what strain you're

634
00:17:27,038 --> 00:17:31,679
growing then i like to know things like

635

kind of cobs we can i don't know a lot

650
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,600
about leds but tell me because i like to

651
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,519
know all that stuff because people

652
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:01,279
ask me in the future how do they do

653
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:02,639
under these kind of leds and i can go

654
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:04,720
back and look and i can say

655
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,080
well tester abb grew them under those

656
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,360
and they did a hell of a job or

657
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:09,439
they didn't look so good under those

658
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:10,240
we'll get reports about it um are you

659
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,919
growing under

660
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,359
uh high pressure sodiums are you growing

661
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:14,000
under ceramic metal halides are you

662
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:15,519
growing under

663
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,359
those uh what are the other lights i

664
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:20,879
can't even think of right now plasmas

665
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:23,359
ceramic metal halides leds hps um

666
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,400
high pressure sodiums ceramic metal i

667
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:25,519
said a lot of lighting what kind of

668
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,640
lights are you growing under you get my

669
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:28,558
damp point

670
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,640
what is the ph of your feed solution how

671
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:32,798
are the plants responding to those feeds

672
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,240
what is the temperature and humidity of

673
00:18:32,798 --> 00:18:35,599
your environment that's something that

674
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,200
always tells me a lot of stuff if your

675
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:37,599
plants look clot out and it's too hot in

676
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,360
there

677
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:40,558
or if it's too wet in there that'll tell

678
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:41,519
me something it's not just the plants

679
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:43,119
it's the environment

680
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:44,558
but how are they reacting to those

681
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:47,199
environmental factors

682
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:49,359
then also i want to know uh germination

683
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,360
rates male to female ratios

684
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:52,479
if i gave you regular seeds even if i

685
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:54,319
gave you femme seeds

686
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,000
what's the ratio of male to female

687
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:57,839
plants out of the plants you got

688
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,519
were there any intersex plants and how

689
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:01,599
many what is the ratio of intersex

690
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:04,000
plants to non-intersex plants

691
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:05,759
uh what was the week that you found

692
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,240
intersex plants if you were growing the

693
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:11,279
plants and some intersex plants came up

694
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,759
what week did you determine that uh

695
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:13,359
let's see

696
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:15,119
how many plants made it to the flowering

697
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:16,479
room if you planted 10 plants

698
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:17,918
and you eliminated some because they

699
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,960
were males you eliminated some just

700
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,038
because you didn't like them

701
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,200
how many made it to the flowering room

702
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:24,558
did you have any issues in the grow is

703
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,160
something i always want to know is there

704
00:19:24,558 --> 00:19:27,678
powdery mildew did you have spider mites

705
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,400
did you find boitritis did you get

706
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,080
thrips

707
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,440
did you overfeed did you under feed did

708
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:33,599
you have a power outage

709
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,038
did something go wrong all of those

710
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:35,759
things will play a factor in the

711
00:19:35,038 --> 00:19:37,440
appearance

712
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:39,599
and performance of your plants so i need

713
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,519
to know that stuff like if you're saying

714
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:42,639
hey jeff's acting really weird lately i

715
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:43,839
don't know what's going on with them but

716
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,919
then if you find out they're like

717
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:47,199
if again all day long these lights are

718
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,559
in my face you'd go well yeah he's going

719
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,080
[ __ ] crazy it's cause those [ __ ]

720
00:19:48,558 --> 00:19:51,359
lights so you'd understand it but if you

721
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:52,720
went i don't know man everything seems

722
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:54,079
fine with them you just think i'm losing

723
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,279
my mind but these bright lights right

724
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:56,319
here in your face all day would make you

725
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:58,480
go [ __ ] crazy

726
00:19:56,319 --> 00:20:00,240
so if you knew that that may play a

727
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,599
different uh you may know you understand

728
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,880
the solution to why things are going on

729
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:03,839
so let me know what's happening in that

730
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,480
girl let me know if you have any

731
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:05,519
problems

732
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,279
let me know if you're putting the bright

733
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:08,558
light in the plant's face all night let

734
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:09,519
me know what's going on then where are

735
00:20:08,558 --> 00:20:11,759
we i want to find

736
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:13,839
my spot on these notes here uh how did

737
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:16,158
the plants react to the issues that

738
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:17,119
it encountered if you got spider spider

739
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:18,400
mites did it

740
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:20,319
love them did it hate them where is it

741
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,200
was it easy to treat for them when you

742
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:23,439
treated for them

743
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,440
how did the plants respond to that were

744
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,320
there other plants in this grow with the

745
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,240
testers

746
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:30,399
how did those plants look overall

747
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,798
compared to my tester plants

748
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,559
did they look amazing next to my plants

749
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:35,119
did my plants look like [ __ ] next to

750
00:20:34,558 --> 00:20:36,960
them

751
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:38,239
how do my plants look amazing you know

752
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,000
what i'm saying right how did they

753
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,919
compare i want to know bro

754
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,359
is mine do i look better than your other

755
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:44,080
plants do my plants look better than

756
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:45,599
yours

757
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:47,119
then how did those plants here's the

758
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:49,119
important part how did those plants

759
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:50,000
react to the same issues if you got

760
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:51,759
spider mites

761
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,679
did my plants handle it better than the

762
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:54,798
plants that you got from another breeder

763
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:57,280
that you're familiar with

764
00:20:54,798 --> 00:20:58,960
how did they react did they do it then

765
00:20:57,279 --> 00:21:00,879
i've got more questions here

766
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,480
how do they compare overall in your

767
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,559
overall grow like just

768
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,079
overall how did they perform how was the

769
00:21:04,558 --> 00:21:07,359
overall yield the performance the

770
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:09,599
potency the flavor

771
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:11,678
how was it then the main question that

772
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:13,359
i'd like to ask my testers is

773
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:15,120
would you buy these seeds again had you

774
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:15,759
not been gifted these seeds if you had

775
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:17,839
paid

776
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:19,038
retail price for these seeds would you

777
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:19,759
have said damn that was a good

778
00:21:19,038 --> 00:21:21,919
investment or

779
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:24,000
would you have said [ __ ] i just wasted

780
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:26,000
that much money on seeds and nutrients

781
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,640
and electricity because i understand

782
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,759
as a breeder as a fellow grower ah i

783
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,840
know that it costs money

784
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:33,200
to just to turn on the [ __ ] light to

785
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:35,839
buy the light costs money

786
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,038
it costs money just to plug it in every

787
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:38,639
second that light's running

788
00:21:37,038 --> 00:21:40,158
there's money coming out of your pocket

789
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,720
you got to buy nutrients you got to buy

790
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:42,400
soil

791
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,079
it costs money just to have that plant

792
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,360
in the room i understand that so i want

793
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:47,759
to know as a breeder

794
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:49,119
would you have been happy to pay money

795
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:50,400
for those seeds or would you have just

796
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:51,759
came back and thrown the [ __ ] root

797
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,480
ball at me and been like [ __ ] these

798

00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,279
it'll start off sweet and end up funky

820

00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,480
want your style of photos

829
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,640
however you take them then try to get me

830
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,480
that really cool bud shot photo that you

831
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,679
see that i post for all the advertising

832
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,319
and all my strains

833
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:58,080
if you give me that cool bud shot photo

834
00:22:56,319 --> 00:22:59,759
that looks amazing from the right angle

835
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:01,279
that makes it look perfect that

836
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:03,119
is going to work well in magazines and

837
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:03,918
on the websites i will use that on the

838
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:05,759
website

839
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:07,679
you'll get credit for it and then again

840
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:08,558
you always get gifts when i do that sort

841
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:10,559
of stuff

842
00:23:08,558 --> 00:23:12,399
so where are we i got lost on my notes

843
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:14,319
trying to find myself here again

844
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,519
let me know how it smokes flavor aroma

845
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:17,839
how's the potency

846
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:19,679
how was the high were you able to get it

847
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:21,199
lab tested

848
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:22,480
if you're able to get it lab test i

849
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,159
really like that let me know if you can

850
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,839
get potency testing

851
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:28,159
let me know if you can get a terpene

852
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:31,439
testing i will definitely trade you

853
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:32,960
more seeds in return for your lab

854
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,960
test because i know those tests are not

855
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,919
cheap they're expensive and it costs you

856
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,440
some of your product you got to

857
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:38,480
sacrifice a little bit of your herb to

858
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,360
give it to the lab

859
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,480
so i will send you more seeds for your

860
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:44,000
lab test

861
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,079
um and then like i said before my

862
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,599
favorite question is would you

863
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:49,359
buy these seeds again or would you have

864
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:50,719
been satisfied if you paid for these

865
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:52,558
seeds out of your pocket

866
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,919
if i didn't send them to you to test

867
00:23:52,558 --> 00:23:55,519
would you do it again

868
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:57,200
would you felt like you got ripped off

869
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:57,839
so those are a lot of the things i

870
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,360
expect

871
00:23:57,839 --> 00:24:00,879
that i require from a tester we're going

872
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:02,399
to talk more about that when we email

873
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,278
back and forth there will be some fine

874
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,559
details

875
00:24:03,278 --> 00:24:09,679
one thing that i do like to stress is

876
00:24:06,558 --> 00:24:12,639
please please do not share

877
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:13,600
or give away these seeds or clones until

878
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,559
i decide

879
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:18,240
if they are to be given away shared sold

880
00:24:16,558 --> 00:24:19,759
or put out for the market

881
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,640
if you give out some stuff that is a

882
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:24,000
tester it may not meet my standards

883
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,038
that's why you're testing it i've

884
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,119
trusted you

885
00:24:25,038 --> 00:24:29,359
