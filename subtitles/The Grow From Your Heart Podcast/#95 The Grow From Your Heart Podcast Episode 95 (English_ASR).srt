to me from a friend he wants to talk

46
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:50,459
about something I said in the episode

00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:53,790
about bagged seeds so we will discuss

48
00:01:50,459 --> 00:01:55,649
that but first I want to read a news

49
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:58,770
article that just came out this article

50
00:01:55,650 --> 00:02:01,140
came out on September 16th I found it in

51
00:01:58,769 --> 00:02:03,479
the cannabis of course this article was

52
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:06,239
written by David McCoy and Ricardo Baca

53
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:09,149
and the article headline says Colorado

54
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:11,969
AG examining pot industry use of organic

55
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:14,849
term sub-headline says because marijuana

56
00:02:11,969 --> 00:02:16,650
is illegal under federal law the use of

57
00:02:14,849 --> 00:02:19,349
the term organic is federally regulated

58
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:21,510
the state licensed cannabis business

59
00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:23,459
can't be certified as organic no matter

60
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:24,840
their practices I'm gonna turn up my

61
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:27,750
headphones just a little bit and then I

62
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,729
will read this article for you and

63
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:31,620
phone's allowed enough here we go Mic

64
00:02:29,729 --> 00:02:33,149
Check headphones that's much better all

65
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,769
right the article goes like this

66
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:36,239
Colorado's Attorney General is

67
00:02:34,769 --> 00:02:37,799
investigating several marijuana

68
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,810
businesses over concerns the word

69
00:02:37,799 --> 00:02:42,120
organic in their names or advertising

70
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:43,709
might be misleading to consumers the

71
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,539
office is reviewing complaints from the

72
00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:47,519
from the consumers that the merchants

73
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:49,349
have been misrepresenting their product

74
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,659
when they say organic or organically

75
00:02:49,349 --> 00:02:53,099
grown said Roger Hudson spokesman for

76
00:02:51,659 --> 00:02:55,379
state attorney general cynthia coffman

77
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:57,000
we're looking for information inside

78
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:59,519
those complaints to make a determination

79
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,009
on what those next steps are is it

80
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,719
consumer fraud is it criminal the agz

81
00:03:02,009 --> 00:03:05,280
office would not give more detail on the

82
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:06,090
scope of the investigation but a lawyer

83
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,949
who

84
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:09,870
a marijuana business contacted by

85
00:03:07,949 --> 00:03:12,509
investigators said it appears to have

86
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:14,459
limits the inquiry includes grow

87
00:03:12,509 --> 00:03:16,169
operations some with organic in their

88
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:18,090
names recently caught up in Denver

89
00:03:16,169 --> 00:03:20,219
quarantines over pesticide concern

90
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:21,689
concerns attorney Sean McAllister said

91
00:03:20,219 --> 00:03:22,889
sorry guys I read that statement a

92
00:03:21,689 --> 00:03:23,219
little bit oddly but you caught what I

93
00:03:22,889 --> 00:03:25,679
said

94
00:03:23,219 --> 00:03:28,139
or what it said the AG is ensuring that

95
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,549
business is ensuring that businesses

96
00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:31,649
that use the word are at least

97
00:03:29,549 --> 00:03:34,140
consistent with the concept of organic

98
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:36,180
McAllister said because marijuana is

99
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:38,098
illegal under federal law and use of the

100
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:40,049
term organic is federally regulated a

101
00:03:38,098 --> 00:03:41,879
licensed cannabis business cannot be

102
00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:44,250
certified as organic no matter its

103
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:45,989
practices as such no marijuana

104
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:48,090
businesses in Colorado can technically

105
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:49,709
use the word in its name or in selling

106
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:52,650
its product according to officials and

107
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:54,390
industry insiders potential fraud

108
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:56,299
penalties under the Colorado consumer

109
00:03:54,389 --> 00:03:59,488
protection act include fines of up to

110
00:03:56,299 --> 00:04:00,989
$10,000 per violation Federal Rules say

111
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:02,969
that businesses wrongly selling a

112
00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:04,890
product as organic could face fines of

113
00:04:02,969 --> 00:04:07,049
up to $10,000

114
00:04:04,889 --> 00:04:09,268
yet those rules have not been enforced

115
00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:12,000
in Colorado's marijuana businesses until

116
00:04:09,269 --> 00:04:14,069
now state marijuana license records show

117
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,930
that twenty nine businesses growers

118
00:04:14,068 --> 00:04:18,538
retailers and dispensaries use the word

119
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:20,970
organic in their name some use a trade

120
00:04:18,538 --> 00:04:23,009
name containing the word organic to

121
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:24,810
market marijuana products or use the

122
00:04:23,009 --> 00:04:27,810
term or do use the term in their

123
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:29,519
advertise a spot check of websites by

124
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:31,829
the Denver Post found businesses

125
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:33,839
claiming to sell 100% organic cannabis

126
00:04:31,829 --> 00:04:36,180
offering organic treatments of medical

127
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:38,129
marijuana or use only organic methods to

128
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:39,660
produce their product some shops

129
00:04:38,129 --> 00:04:41,699
describe their product as grown in

130
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:44,479
organic soil or that they use organic

131
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:46,709
growing techniques another website touts

132
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:48,418
certification or of organic standards

133
00:04:46,709 --> 00:04:50,609
and testing that mirrors the US

134
00:04:48,418 --> 00:04:53,159
Department of Agriculture organic

135
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:55,319
certification Brook Weis owner of the

136
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,490
growing kitchen in Boulder said that

137
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:58,409
she's willing to take the risk of

138
00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:00,269
labeling her company's edibles made with

139
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:02,250
certified organic seeds and fruits as

140
00:05:00,269 --> 00:05:05,038
organic even if the marijuana in them

141
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:06,629
isn't it's a principle an ideology that

142
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:09,269
doesn't belong to anybody she said

143
00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:10,709
nothing her plants noting her plants

144
00:05:09,269 --> 00:05:13,109
would be certified organic if that

145
00:05:10,709 --> 00:05:15,658
existed on the list of sacrifices and

146
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:18,030
Gamble's I take organic is definitely on

147
00:05:15,658 --> 00:05:19,709
there but Riverrock cannabis in Denver

148
00:05:18,029 --> 00:05:21,269
has backed away from using the term

149
00:05:19,709 --> 00:05:23,099
until recently the company had been

150
00:05:21,269 --> 00:05:25,529
known as river rock organic medical

151
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:27,210
cannabis the Attorney General sent

152
00:05:25,529 --> 00:05:30,209
something saying that no dispensary can

153
00:05:27,209 --> 00:05:32,489
be certified as organic retail manager

154
00:05:30,209 --> 00:05:34,169
Chris Haggerty said the company changed

155
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:35,579
signs stopped handing out promotional

156
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:37,080
items with the company's name and even

157
00:05:35,579 --> 00:05:39,539
stopped selling t-shirts with the old

158
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:41,550
company name Haggerty said a group

159
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:43,410
seeking to have marijuana certifiable as

160
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:45,600
organic said a system for informing

161
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:47,910
consumers how marijuana is grown is

162
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,860
needed the word organic is being used

163
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:51,930
inappropriately by people who are using

164
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:53,850
very toxic chemicals there's no

165
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:56,040
governing agency that is regulating that

166
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:58,020
said John Paul max field co-founder of

167
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:00,660
the organic cannabis Association in

168
00:05:58,019 --> 00:06:02,609
Denver in the absence of a body coming

169
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:04,890
through and branding organic cannabis

170
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:07,980
that term can be used by everybody even

171
00:06:04,889 --> 00:06:09,509
if it's not done properly the USDA

172
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:11,340
accredits companies and state

173
00:06:09,509 --> 00:06:12,689
governments to certify any farm is

174
00:06:11,339 --> 00:06:15,149
complying with federal Organic

175
00:06:12,689 --> 00:06:16,980
regulations for agricultural products no

176
00:06:15,149 --> 00:06:19,379
company may use the term without this

177
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:21,300
certification marijuana may not be

178
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:24,600
certified organic under the USDA Organic

179
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:26,040
regulations said a USDA spokesman who

180
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,390
could not be named because it's the

181
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:29,640
agency's policy when discussing

182
00:06:27,389 --> 00:06:31,050
marijuana marijuana is considered a

183
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,729
controlled substance at the federal

184
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:35,280
level an organic certification is

185
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:37,910
reserved for agricultural products the

186
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:40,500
USDA's National Organic Program rules

187
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:42,240
say companies with organic in their name

188
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:44,339
cannot prominently display it on a

189
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,290
product and cannot use the name at all

190
00:06:44,339 --> 00:06:49,049
if it misrepresents that a product has

191
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:50,790
been certified organic it falls to the

192
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:52,829
Colorado Department of Agriculture to

193
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:54,750
certify and accredit agricultural

194
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:56,849
businesses in the state as organic as

195
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:59,069
well as police for inappropriate and

196
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:02,430
illegal uses of the word on behalf of

197
00:06:59,069 --> 00:07:04,560
the USDA if the state chose to certify

198
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:06,720
marijuana as organic it would have to

199
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,300
ignore federal rules and that's unlikely

200
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,400
said Mitch here director of CDA's plant

201
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:13,350
industry division

202
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:15,209
um that's weird because we've already

203
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:17,250
ignored federal rules and we have

204
00:07:15,209 --> 00:07:19,228
legalized recreational cannabis so why

205
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:20,850
wouldn't we just do it again anyway

206
00:07:19,228 --> 00:07:22,709
that's my opinion on that the state's

207
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:23,910
inquiry came after the Denver Department

208
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:26,579
of Environmental Health this year

209
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:29,039
quarantined more than 100,000 marijuana

210
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:31,079
plants over pesticide concerns one

211
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:33,449
company organic greens tested positive

212
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:35,279
for unapproved pesticides but because it

213
00:07:33,449 --> 00:07:37,110
operates publicly as natural remedies

214
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:40,739
the agz office allowed it to keep its

215
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:42,569
name said McAllister its attorney their

216
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,918
actual corporation name is organic

217
00:07:42,569 --> 00:07:45,930
greens but they don't use it in

218
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:48,389
advertising so they don't publicize

219
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:50,668
themselves as organic they don't do any

220
00:07:48,389 --> 00:07:53,310
advertising as organic so nobody's being

221
00:07:50,668 --> 00:07:55,459
misled McAllister said confirming the

222
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:57,930
company name under AG scrutiny

223
00:07:55,459 --> 00:07:59,819
McAllister said the AG is focusing at

224
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:01,918
least in part on companies that have

225
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:03,810
used pesticide that have used pesticides

226
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:05,939
not allowed by the state for use on

227
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:07,379
marijuana they understand you can't get

228
00:08:05,939 --> 00:08:10,348
federal certification for the word

229
00:08:07,379 --> 00:08:12,180
organic in marijuana he said the agz

230
00:08:10,348 --> 00:08:14,009
office is not substituting themselves

231
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:16,199
for a certification agency but if they

232
00:08:14,009 --> 00:08:18,150
clearly but if it's clearly not organic

233
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:20,509
if someone's using Mallett or Eagle 20

234
00:08:18,149 --> 00:08:23,038
they're also looking for those cases

235
00:08:20,509 --> 00:08:25,589
ballot in Eagle 20 our pesticide trade

236
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:27,180
names well whose active ingredients

237
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:30,149
contain chemicals the state has not

238
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:31,769
approved for use on marijuana and I've

239
00:08:30,149 --> 00:08:33,088
said this on a previous episode but I

240
00:08:31,769 --> 00:08:34,620
was speaking with somebody from the

241
00:08:33,089 --> 00:08:37,140
Department of Agriculture they actually

242
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:38,700
came to I'm the master grower at the

243
00:08:37,139 --> 00:08:40,769
spot dispensary so I had to meet with

244
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:43,408
the Department of Agriculture they sent

245
00:08:40,769 --> 00:08:46,079
two reps down to come talk to us um and

246
00:08:43,408 --> 00:08:48,088
the main rep told me that the main

247
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,790
reason that Eagle 20 has been banned

248
00:08:48,089 --> 00:08:53,310
from dispensary uses is because if there

249
00:08:50,789 --> 00:08:54,299
is a fire and the Eagle 20 burns the

250
00:08:53,309 --> 00:08:57,179
off-gassing

251
00:08:54,299 --> 00:08:58,528
turns into cyanide and the fire

252
00:08:57,179 --> 00:09:00,958
department doesn't want to go into a

253
00:08:58,528 --> 00:09:03,419
building that is filled with the gas of

254
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:04,649
cyanide so that's mainly why Eagle 20

255
00:09:03,419 --> 00:09:06,929
has been banned also it's completely

256
00:09:04,649 --> 00:09:08,730
toxic but he didn't even seem to care

257
00:09:06,929 --> 00:09:10,409
about the toxicity of the product he

258
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:12,240
just wanted to tell me about it turning

259
00:09:10,409 --> 00:09:14,699
into cyanide is why it's been banned

260
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,409
from use in commercial growth facilities

261
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,940
so I'll keep going with the article

262
00:09:16,409 --> 00:09:20,039
there's one more sentence here left one

263
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:21,660
more short paragraph it says although no

264
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:23,789
chemical pesticide can obtain federal

265
00:09:21,659 --> 00:09:25,079
approval for use on cannabis state

266
00:09:23,789 --> 00:09:26,519
agriculture officials have

267
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,680
termined which products have labels

268
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:30,899
whose restrictions are so broadly worded

269
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:34,769
that using them on marijuana would not

270
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:37,230
be a violation so they were cracking

271
00:09:34,769 --> 00:09:38,970
down on it you guys when I first started

272
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:40,560
in the medical marijuana world I was

273
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:42,840
shopping at a dispensary that had the

274
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:44,819
word organic in it and I knew right away

275
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:46,230
when I looked at the medicine when I saw

276
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:49,170
how they grew I knew there was nothing

277
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:51,800
to do with actual organics they were

278
00:09:49,169 --> 00:09:54,120
just trying to use the word organic as a

279
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:59,069
marketing ploy and it was working and

280
00:09:54,120 --> 00:10:03,000
also just to put this out there they do

281
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:05,910
require that all of the ingredients used

282
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,919
in the grow anything that was sprayed or

283
00:10:05,909 --> 00:10:11,189
fed to the plants does have to be listed

284
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:12,779
on an instruction list or instruction

285
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:14,340
ingredients list I'm sorry an

286
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:16,019
ingredients list on the outside of the

287
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:18,210
container so all of that [ __ ] does have

288
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:20,460
to be listed on the package that the

289
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:22,500
cannabis or hatch is sold that actually

290
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:23,700
let me reach over here this is just the

291
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,929
inner packaging this one doesn't have

292
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,340
the ingredients on it sorry

293
00:10:24,929 --> 00:10:27,719
but most of the time it's got a few

294
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:29,670
things written on it and if you come by

295
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:32,160
cannabis in the state of Colorado you'll

296
00:10:29,669 --> 00:10:33,839
get a little jar like a childproof jar

297
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:35,459
or whatever they put the cannabis in and

298
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:37,560
it'll have some ingredients listed on it

299
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:39,690
and you'll see things like calcium and

300
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:41,699
you'll see things like mykos and

301
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:43,230
beneficial bacteria and you'll see stuff

302
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:45,330
like that that's all what was used in

303
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:47,610
the growing of the plant so they will

304
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:49,980
also hopefully list any pesticides that

305
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:52,409
were sprayed on there alright so they're

306
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:54,450
cracking down on the name organic then

307
00:10:52,409 --> 00:10:56,490
they are also cracking down to make sure

308
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:58,410
that your [ __ ] is organic which I really

309
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:59,850
appreciate I really like that because

310
00:10:58,409 --> 00:11:01,079
there are a lot of shops serving up do

311
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:02,550
do that you can tell it was not

312
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:05,310
organically grown you can taste the

313
00:11:02,549 --> 00:11:08,159
fertilizers in it I know friends that

314
00:11:05,309 --> 00:11:11,219
own hydro shops and I know friends that

315
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:13,469
are reps and consultants for

316
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:15,480
dispensaries and they go to places they

317
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:16,800
claimed to be running organics and then

318
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,450
when they make their order from the

319
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:20,099
hydro shop or when they set up a

320
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:21,629
nutrient schedule with the consultant

321
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:23,879
they go with the product that is

322
00:11:21,629 --> 00:11:26,159
completely not organic and they don't

323
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:27,210
seem to give a [ __ ] but you can't say

324
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:27,629
anything you just got to let them do

325
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:29,850
their thing

326
00:11:27,629 --> 00:11:31,429
so I'm glad now somebody is going to

327
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:33,840
call them out and make them accountable

328
00:11:31,429 --> 00:11:36,539
alright I'm gonna take a DAB in a quick

329
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:38,550
drink and then we're going to address an

330
00:11:36,539 --> 00:11:41,129
email that was sent to us by a listener

331
00:11:38,549 --> 00:11:43,409
about something I said in episode number

332
00:11:41,129 --> 00:11:45,240
90 so hang out for a few seconds and

333
00:11:43,409 --> 00:11:46,799
I'll be right back all right you guys I

334
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,240
am back I just wanted to let you know if

335
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:49,919
you hear a bunch of a ruckus in the

336
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,389
background there there are no hostages

337
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:53,549
in my house there's actually a football

338
00:11:51,389 --> 00:11:55,980
game happening right now there's a

339
00:11:53,549 --> 00:11:57,599
Denver Broncos game and my neighbors are

340
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:58,889
having a party and I got my window open

341
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,450
a little bit so whenever something

342
00:11:58,889 --> 00:12:03,389
happens in the game you can hear them

343
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:05,879
either cheer or jeer whichever way it

344
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:07,439
goes it's pretty entertaining so if you

345
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:09,059
hear the screams no I don't have

346
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,100
hostages here in the house it's just a

347
00:12:09,059 --> 00:12:14,549
football game and people are going crazy

348
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:16,440
um so all right just a few days ago I

349
00:12:14,549 --> 00:12:18,000
received an email from a friend of ours

350
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,440
let's get into this email and pulling it

351
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,389
up in my phone right now here we go

352
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,430
all right this email is from our friend

353
00:12:21,389 --> 00:12:25,679
Justin and it says I just listened to

354
00:12:23,429 --> 00:12:27,959
episode 90 I guess I was operating on

355
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:29,789
some incorrect information you and Jessi

356
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:31,710
seemed to feel like Herms are really bad

357
00:12:29,789 --> 00:12:32,730
I was told her seeds were pretty much

358
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:35,430
feminized seeds

359
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:37,620
since the genetics all came from female

360
00:12:35,429 --> 00:12:40,049
so basically we would revenge out plants

361
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:42,179
after harvest and then light poisoned

362
00:12:40,049 --> 00:12:43,799
them to make seeds for the future so I'm

363
00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:45,959
wondering if those progeny from the

364
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:48,089
seeds would be predisposed to Herm in

365
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:50,430
the future if you could just explain a

366
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:52,379
little to me or cover this on the show I

367
00:12:50,429 --> 00:12:56,699
would super-duper love that thanks Ross

368
00:12:52,379 --> 00:12:57,929
to Jeff from Justin G all right so the

369
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,360
seeds you're talking about are not

370
00:12:57,929 --> 00:13:01,019
necessarily Herms

371
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:04,230
hermaphrodites either different

372
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:05,909
hermaphrodite seeds come from when there

373
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:08,009
is a female plant in the room that

374
00:13:05,909 --> 00:13:11,129
suddenly pops a male flower and that

375
00:13:08,009 --> 00:13:13,500
male flower pollinates the room and a

376
00:13:11,129 --> 00:13:15,750
few seeds happen from that small

377
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:17,669
pollination so there's a big difference

378
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:19,230
in kind of a hermaphrodite seed and what

379
00:13:17,669 --> 00:13:21,120
you're talking about I took a few notes

380
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:22,830
and wrote a few things down I'm gonna

381
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,539
kind of try to read this to you and

382
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:27,420
sound like I'm not reading something to

383
00:13:24,539 --> 00:13:29,730
you but here's what I wrote those seeds

384
00:13:27,419 --> 00:13:31,709
that you made are made by stressing the

385
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:34,170
plant so it has so as long as there were

386
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:37,050
no males or stray pollen available to

387
00:13:34,169 --> 00:13:38,909
the females and also the females are

388
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:41,250
solid females the seeds produced will be

389
00:13:38,909 --> 00:13:43,559
females because of the lack of a why

390
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:46,169
male chromosome so technically those

391
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:48,119
won't be herm seeds if the none of the

392
00:13:46,169 --> 00:13:49,949
females hermaphrodite it and made male

393
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:52,049
flowers that release pollen on in there

394
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:53,278
and they should be feminized so

395
00:13:52,049 --> 00:13:55,049
as long as none of your female plants

396
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:56,700
are throwing off bananas or male pollen

397
00:13:55,049 --> 00:13:59,309
sacks you will be making female seeds

398
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:02,550
here um if a plant is allowed to flower

399
00:13:59,309 --> 00:14:04,739
for too long it'll often make seeds if a

400
00:14:02,549 --> 00:14:06,389
plant is light stressed which is what

401
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:08,339
you guys are doing then those plants

402
00:14:06,389 --> 00:14:11,100
will make seeds and those seeds are

403
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:14,070
feminized another way to make feminized

404
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:16,170
seeds is soma takes a plant that is

405
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:17,519
almost finished it'll be around week six

406
00:14:16,169 --> 00:14:19,049
or seven for like a nine week plant

407
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:22,019
he'll take it around week six or seven

408
00:14:19,049 --> 00:14:24,569
and then he will light a small fire and

409
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:26,490
put that fire next to the plant to make

410
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:27,930
it feel like it's in a forest fire he

411
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:29,879
will heat the [ __ ] out of the plant

412
00:14:27,929 --> 00:14:31,259
he'll move the heat around the plant and

413
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:33,389
kind of freak it out and that plant

414
00:14:31,259 --> 00:14:35,429
thinks it's in a forest fire and it's

415
00:14:33,389 --> 00:14:37,289
panic reaction is to start making seeds

416
00:14:35,429 --> 00:14:39,539
so he'll have to give it four to six

417
00:14:37,289 --> 00:14:41,849
weeks from there to finish seeding but

418
00:14:39,539 --> 00:14:45,599
by week twelve summer will have a big

419
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:48,120
batch of feminized s1 seeds that don't

420
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:51,240
have any other chromosomes in them

421
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:53,990
except this chromosomes coming from that

422
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:56,659
plant so you're going to be basically

423
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:59,399
copying the plant that you just stressed

424
00:14:56,659 --> 00:15:00,809
so you are making feminized seeds there

425
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:02,549
when Jesse and I were talking about

426
00:15:00,809 --> 00:15:05,338
hermaphrodite seeds we were talking more

427
00:15:02,549 --> 00:15:08,069
about seeds that were caused by a

428
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:10,800
hermaphrodite issue in a room say one of

429
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:13,740
your females were to pop a pollen sack

430
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:15,899
during week seven or whatever a week six

431
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:17,278
or seven and that hits another plant and

432
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:19,919
it pollinates and it makes a little bit

433
00:15:17,278 --> 00:15:22,078
of seed that seed will be kind of

434
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:24,360
questionable it may have hermaphroditic

435
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:26,458
traits but it still could be gold as

436
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:28,050
what we were talking about so there is a

437
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:30,629
little bit of difference in her seed and

438
00:15:28,049 --> 00:15:32,578
what you're doing herm seed is kind of a

439
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:34,708
trait issue what you're doing is kind of

440
00:15:32,578 --> 00:15:36,359
a manipulation sort of a stressing and a

441
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:39,269
panic reaction sort of a thing I

442
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:41,610
encourage you to keep doing that if you

443
00:15:39,269 --> 00:15:42,659
got any extra seeds man I'd love to grow

444
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:46,289
a couple of those and see what they do

445
00:15:42,659 --> 00:15:47,698
I'll take some pictures for you so one

446
00:15:46,289 --> 00:15:48,929
thing that I do that's kind of on this

447
00:15:47,698 --> 00:15:50,458
realm and this is just because I wanted

448
00:15:48,929 --> 00:15:52,649
to rant about this it's kind of what

449
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:55,379
this reminded me of before I breed with

450
00:15:52,649 --> 00:15:57,299
plants I will take my females and I will

451
00:15:55,379 --> 00:15:58,948
put them in the flowering room and I

452
00:15:57,299 --> 00:16:00,240
will set the timer to twelve twelve and

453
00:15:58,948 --> 00:16:02,969
I'll let them flower for about two weeks

454
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,870
and as soon as I see Bud set I will

455
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:07,720
reverse the timer for

456
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:09,580
9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. I will now have

457
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:11,589
them off from 9:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m.

458
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:14,290
and they will come on at 9:00 p.m. to

459
00:16:11,589 --> 00:16:16,450
9:00 a.m. for about five days and then

460
00:16:14,289 --> 00:16:18,639
after five or six days I will put the

461
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:20,320
timer back to the original 12:12 they'll

462
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,980
come on at 9:00 a.m. and go off at 9:00

463
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,600
p.m.

464
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,950
and I'll pay real close attention to

465
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,960
them for about a week and a half and

466
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:27,850
then I'll [ __ ] with the timer again I'll

467
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:29,680
turn it on for twenty four hours

468
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:31,330
why not and then I'll just do weird

469
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:33,579
random [ __ ] with my schedules in there

470
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:35,290
and then I'll put it back on twelve

471
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:37,360
twelve for a few days and watch the

472
00:16:35,289 --> 00:16:39,278
plants and if they start freaking out

473
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,519
real bad then I kind of get rid of the

474
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:43,750
plants that can't handle some stress ah

475
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,980
sometimes I go light stress testing cuz

476
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:46,870
a little bit will tell me what I want to

477
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:48,519
see but sometimes you get curious as a

478
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:50,320
grower and you want to go through and

479
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:51,850
really pummel a female plant and see

480
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,050
what that [ __ ] can handle before you go

481
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:55,600
putting her into a major breeding

482
00:16:53,049 --> 00:16:58,838
project so I've actually got a couple of

483
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,820
plants that I can take them to week two

484
00:16:58,839 --> 00:17:02,350
and totally reverse the light cycle and

485
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:04,299
it doesn't piss them off I can do it a

486
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:06,939
couple of times and they don't her mout

487
00:17:04,299 --> 00:17:10,240
however if I let those same plants go

488
00:17:06,939 --> 00:17:12,429
long enough without any light stress if

489
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,929
I let them go too long they will start

490
00:17:12,429 --> 00:17:16,809
to produce seeds because I've let some

491
00:17:13,929 --> 00:17:18,850
strains go up to 80 days strains that

492
00:17:16,808 --> 00:17:20,170
should only go 60 I've let them go 80

493
00:17:18,849 --> 00:17:21,969
just to see what happens when you grow

494
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:22,990
as much as we do you need a plan with

495
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:25,179
some things that's how you learn a lot

496
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:27,459
of [ __ ] I let him go a little bit long

497
00:17:25,179 --> 00:17:30,009
just to see what happened and it was

498
00:17:27,459 --> 00:17:32,830
seeded the plant had by that 20 extra

499
00:17:30,009 --> 00:17:34,089
days put seeds in my plant so you can do

500
00:17:32,829 --> 00:17:35,619
it by light stress you can do it by

501
00:17:34,089 --> 00:17:37,839
extending them there's a lot of

502
00:17:35,619 --> 00:17:40,000
different ways to do it if you're going

503
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:41,859
to stress test your females I kind of

504
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,779
just told you how I would do it I would

505
00:17:41,859 --> 00:17:45,699
just [ __ ] with the light cycles as a

506
00:17:43,779 --> 00:17:47,109
breeder one thing I want to say is when

507
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:48,880
you grow out those seeds that you're

508
00:17:47,109 --> 00:17:51,369
making from manipulated plants really

509
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,200
pay close attention to hermaphroditic

510
00:17:51,369 --> 00:17:55,149
traits you may not find the

511
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,950
hermaphrodites until like week eight of

512
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:59,410
a nine week plant or of a ten week plant

513
00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:02,019
so really pay attention to that that

514
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:04,029
shouldn't be there but you are making a

515
00:18:02,019 --> 00:18:06,069
manipulated seed that's not natural so

516
00:18:04,029 --> 00:18:07,990
there is a chance for some weirdness

517
00:18:06,069 --> 00:18:10,089
all right I hope that answered your

518
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:11,829
question in your email go ahead and grow

519
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:14,019

520
00:18:11,829 --> 00:18:16,389
to keep yourself self sustainable and

521
00:18:14,019 --> 00:18:18,339

522

541

542
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,500
doing periscope videos I've been getting

543

a lot more messages so things are going

544
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:02,240
a little bit crazy Facebook Instagram

545
00:18:59,569 --> 00:19:04,730
Twitter all that stuff keeps me tied up

546
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,529
and I've been working at the spot doing

547
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:08,360
quite a few hours every week so that

548
00:19:06,529 --> 00:19:10,039
limits my time for social media but I

549
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:12,769
will answer your question is what I

550
00:19:10,039 --> 00:19:14,629

00:22:32,329 --> 00:22:35,329
pot before they'll listen to the show

658

smokes a gram of hash every single day

00:22:45,589 --> 00:22:49,819
[ __ ] together maybe weed isn't so bad

665
00:22:47,569 --> 00:22:51,500
then maybe they'll lighten up and then

666
00:22:49,819 --> 00:22:53,619
maybe they'll be on our side and then

667
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:56,509
