00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,599
tocom today's first question came from

23
00:01:06,118 --> 00:01:09,599
somebody who wants to be called Mike

24
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:12,559
diesel big shout out to my new friend

25
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:15,438
Mike diesel Mike's question goes just

26
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,000
like this Mike says I've got a two-part

27
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:19,039
question and I will answer both of those

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,799
questions for you buddy it says what

29
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:24,280
size grow tent and type of seed do you

30
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:26,600
recommend for a firsttime grower now

31
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:29,000
this is a very good question a very fun

32
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:31,640
question um for a firsttime grower I

33
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,519
would recommend something like a 3X3 or

34
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:37,118
a 5x5 if you have room for a 5x 51 that

35
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:40,078
is definitely what I would recommend and

36
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:41,680
suggest if you've got a 3X3 do that if

37
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:43,839
you need to go smaller of course work

38
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:47,118
your way down but I would recommend that

39
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:50,320
5x5 that 3x3 those two tents are very

40
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:52,200
easy to manage uh very easy to maintain

41
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:54,679
uh very easy to get equipment that fits

42
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,840
perfectly inside those tents uh our

43
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:59,000
friends at AC Infinity if you do go

44
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:01,478

45
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,640

46
00:02:01,478 --> 00:02:06,599
our friends at AC Infiniti make a

47
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:08,759
perfect package for a 5x5 tent a 3X3

48
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:10,239
tent you can order everything in one box

49
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:11,958
it will show up on your front door

50
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,200
you're basically ready to go all you

51
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:15,878
need are some seeds and some nutrients

52
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:19,359
it is really easy to do so I would

53
00:02:15,878 --> 00:02:22,199
recommend starting with a 5x5 or a 3X3

54
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:25,519
like I said go smaller as you need to if

55
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:27,839
necessary I really like the 5x5 for the

56
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:29,920
amount of space uh the canopy space in

57
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,439
there and just managing that much space

58
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:33,719
is much easier that's the right amount

59
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:35,800
of space honestly right now uh the next

60
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:39,439
seeds that you purchase from me will

61
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:42,120
have been bred in a 5x5 AC Infinity ttin

62
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:44,840
I like the 5x5 because I can control

63
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:47,480
that environment very perfectly that 5x5

64
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:50,560
space is very easy to manage uh the

65
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:51,919
temperature the humidity the overall VPD

66
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,239
uh it's easy to manage the amount of

67
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:55,399
plants that fit into there it's the

68
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:57,599
right amount of space for the right size

69
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:00,560
light um I just think it's a really easy

70
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:03,039
perfectly manageable space that 5x5 is a

71
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,439
really ideal space for a new grower so

72
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:07,199
I've said it enough a 3X3 a 5x5 of

73
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:09,719
course I'm going to advertise the AC

74
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:11,679
Infinity tents uh the lights the blowers

75
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:13,719
the fans everything AC Infinity kicks

76
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,760
ass they make it super easy check out

77
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:19,439
the new AC Infinity AI controller uh you

78
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:21,079
basically tell it uh I want a veg and

79
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:23,400
then it says you're in veg and it sets

80
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,599
all your gear to veg for you and you veg

81
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,519
then when it's time to flower you tell

82
00:03:24,598 --> 00:03:28,919
it I want a flower and it goes oh we'll

83
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:31,080
flower for you and AC Infinity basically

84
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:34,079
puts the plants into flowering mode for

85
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:36,159
you so AC Infinity 5x5 tent is the way

86
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,760
to go so the second part of the question

87
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:39,878
is what type of seeds would you

88
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:42,560
recommend for a firsttime grower would

89
00:03:39,878 --> 00:03:44,079
you recommend Autos or fem um of course

90
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,799
you know I'm not a big fan of the

91
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,560
Autoflower seeds I just did a full

92
00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:50,159
episode about that so I'm going to

93
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:52,560
recommend photo period feminized seeds

94
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:54,719
for a new grower uh that sets you up for

95
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,680
Success uh the photo period gives you

96
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:59,120
the opportunity to learn the cycles of

97
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:02,040
the plant if you want to do lollipopping

98
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,438
defoliation popping twisting uh certain

99
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:06,239
manipulation techniques and low stress

100
00:04:04,438 --> 00:04:08,039
training techniques to your plants you

101
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,079
can learn that stuff with the photo

102
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:12,078
period plants the autof flowers don't

103
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:14,120
give you as much of an opportunity to

104
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:15,760
manipulate and play with them uh you

105
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:18,199
don't get to experiment with that veg

106
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:20,719
cycle when you were doing the Autoflower

107
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:22,600
plants so I would recommend the photo

108
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,759
period feminized of course the fem

109
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:26,520
that's going to help you uh minimize

110
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:28,319
your risk of male plants and of course

111
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:30,519
for new Growers I do always recommend

112
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:32,519
the feminized seeds that just sets you

113
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:34,639
up for Success one more Step Closer To

114
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:36,799
Success you don't need to watch as

115
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,560
closely for male plants in the garden

116
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,280
there is the opportunity with all

117
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,478
breeders with all seeds that there is

118
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:44,959
that opportunity of a rare male or a

119
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:47,120
rare intersex plant the dreaded intersex

120
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:48,758
plant from your fem seed uh no matter

121
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,160
who the breeder is how good those seeds

122
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:53,800
are that is still an opportunity so do

123
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:56,080
pay attention but the photo period

124
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:58,240

goes a little bit like this should I be

156
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:12,639
flushing my mother plants to get rid of

157
00:06:10,598 --> 00:06:14,598
excess nutrients and then give them pure

158
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:18,720
water for two weeks and then start

159
00:06:14,598 --> 00:06:21,159
nutrients back up um absolutely not then

160
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,840
it says about every two or three months

161
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:25,039

00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,598
can help me out with this question bro

166
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:35,879
here it is this is the video with the

167
00:06:32,598 --> 00:06:37,759
answer to your question uh I gently

168
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:40,038
replied to this listener this viewer I

169
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:42,080
said why would you flush and then they

170
00:06:40,038 --> 00:06:43,800
said I'm using two gallon fiber pots for

171
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:45,560
my mothers how often should I be

172
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:48,759
flushing the soil I'm using basic

173
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:51,918
Botanicare veg nutrients and my reply to

174
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:53,680
this my response to this is um why do

175
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:55,680
you need to flush what are you flushing

176
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,560
what are you flushing out uh those

177
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,079
plants are using the nutrients that you

178
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:01,959
were feeding them so um you're feeding

179
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:04,000
the plant the plant is eating that

180
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:06,560
unless you see some sort of major

181
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,560
problem with your plants I never

182
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,319
recommend a flush and let me talk about

183
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:13,598
quickly what a flush is a flush a purge

184
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:16,000
if you will I think it's the same idea a

185
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:18,639
flush that is when uh we would take an

186
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,918
amount of water um and we would run that

187
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:24,519
through our soil our media soilless mix

188
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:26,719
and run that through our plant until we

189
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:28,758
get drainage of that water coming out of

190
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,039
the bottom of the plant that is a flush

191
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:33,160
feed it just water the idea is to flush

192
00:07:31,038 --> 00:07:34,918
all of the nutrients out of that uh the

193
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:37,199
rizosphere we want to clean that out

194
00:07:34,918 --> 00:07:39,439
give ourselves a fresh clean medium is

195
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:42,759
the thought process here and this

196
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:45,038
listener said uh flush it and give them

197
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:47,720
pure water for two weeks dude your

198
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:49,079
plants are going to be freaking angry if

199
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,319
you don't feed them for two weeks

200
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:51,918
they're going to starve they're going to

201
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,319
get yellow they're going to get

202
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:55,359
everything deficient you're going to

203
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:57,680
start seeing problems uh within the

204
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,840
first 7 to 10 days maybe 3 to 5 days

205
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,519
depending on how big the plant are how

206
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:03,119
big the containers are how powerful the

207
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:05,038
lighting is you're going to notice

208
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,079
issues if you flush and do not feed

209
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:09,918
there's not going to be any nutrition

210
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:12,279
available so I never recommend a flush

211
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:14,758
with just water even if it's phed water

212
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:16,638
unpaged water clean water I don't ever

213
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:18,199
recommend a flush with the intentions of

214
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,400
just cleaning out that rizosphere

215
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:23,038
cleaning out the root Zone I never

216
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:25,038
recommend that flush the only reason

217
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:27,680
that it would be reasonable in my

218
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:29,719
opinion is if you had a major problem in

219
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,319
your plants if they were showing you

220
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:33,759
everything is [ __ ] wrong we've been

221
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:36,120
overfed everything that's when I would

222
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:38,120
consider the flush but that would be my

223
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:40,360
last option what I would do instead of

224
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:42,839
that um and this is not this does not

225
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:45,240
apply to this situation in this viewer

226
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:47,399
situation no flush not necessary don't

227
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:49,799
do it business as usual will keep going

228
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:52,399
if you do see a problem then consider a

229
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:54,519
flush but consider this option first and

230
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:56,080
just hear me out think about it this way

231
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:58,120
let's just say you've got a plant it's

232
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,879
showing you a lot of problems it could

233
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,399
be overfed it could be under fed it

234
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:03,399
could be a nutrient lock out we're just

235
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:04,759
not quite sure what's happening uh

236
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:07,039
you've showed it to the internet you've

237
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:08,559
come to the Discord server everybody's

238
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:10,159
done that thing like a bunch of old guys

239
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:11,958
with a beer in one hand a cigarette in

240
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:13,759
the other [ __ ] stood around the truck

241
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:15,518
and went I think it's your alternator I

242
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:17,480
think it's your timing belt I think it

243
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,000
could be the muffler bearing everybody

244
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,440
has said their statement what they think

245
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,360
it is but we don't really know what's

246
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,839
wrong there's so many issues appearing

247
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:27,278
and presenting in this plant we're not

248
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:29,600
exactly sure we could flush but that's

249
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:31,078
going to lead to like I said deficiency

250
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,600
it's going to cause more problems now

251
00:09:31,078 --> 00:09:35,000
the plant is deficient in everything

252
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,519
that's not going to correct anything in

253
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,759
my opinion uh I think in my experience

254
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,720
that's going to make the plant more

255
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:43,240
angry and worse now you've got an

256
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,480
overwatered rizosphere your root zone is

257
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:47,240
all saturated with water and now it's

258
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:50,120
just water now the plant's going well

259
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:51,600
now I'm [ __ ] overwatered and hungry

260
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,799
and I don't know what to do with myself

261
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,399
so it's just going to start freaking out

262
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:58,278
what I would recommend mix up for

263
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:01,200
whatever stage of growth you were in if

264
00:09:58,278 --> 00:10:03,078
you were in veg uh early flow midlow

265
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,360
late flow those are your basic stages of

266
00:10:03,078 --> 00:10:06,879
growth with the cannabis plant you get

267
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:09,278
four or five different phases here three

268
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:12,679
trimesters of flour whatever phase you

269
00:10:09,278 --> 00:10:14,159
are in mix up a batch of a nutrient

270
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:16,199
solution so whatever you mix you got

271
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:18,799
your 5 gallon bucket your 250 gallon

272
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:21,040
Reservoir makes up a feed solution that

273
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:23,759
you are very familiar with and you know

274
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:26,000
works every time every Grower's got a

275
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:28,319
go-to recipe that they go up the shit's

276
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,200
messing up I better go back to this when

277
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,360
you go back to that recipe that you know

278
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:34,519
works every time it's going to fix your

279
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:36,039
problem so go back to this recipe make

280
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:38,560
sure that everything you need is in

281
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:40,039
there your base nutrients your cow mag

282
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:41,759
whatever you're going to feed put some

283
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:43,559
definitely throw a bunch of recharge in

284
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:45,519
there put some silicates in there I

285
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:47,119
don't know what you feed uh we'll go

286
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:51,240
through I'm trying to think of my lineup

287
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:53,639
it would be uh Botanicare pure blend Pro

288
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,639
um the if we're it depends on what stage

289
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:57,159
we're in we're just going to say we're

290
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:59,519
in veg it'd be the Botanicare pure blend

291
00:10:57,159 --> 00:11:01,639
Pro veg bottle would be the first bottle

292
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,839
actually that's wrong probably Silica

293
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:05,839
Blast some potassium potassium silicates

294
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,440
are going to go first so we got our

295
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,440
potassium silicates we got our base

296
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,519
nutrient a little bit of cowm Mag a

297
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,680
little bit of liquid Karma what else are

298
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,440
we going to do in there some

299
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:16,519
carbohydrates a nice carb product would

300
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:18,160
be nice in there um and then some

301
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:19,440
recharge that's probably enough to

302
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:22,078
liquid Karma we're going to add liquid

303
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,880
Karma almost every time oh and Ruby

304
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:25,679
fulvic from our friends at New

305
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:27,039
Millennium uh so then we're going to mix

306
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:29,759
all that stuff up properly we're going

307
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:32,120
to pH it uh before we put the recharge

308
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:34,200
in we'll pH it get it at the correct pH

309
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:36,959
I don't know what PH you're using but

310
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:39,600
somewhere between 62 and 65 probably get

311
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:40,838
it dialed in use a consistent pH then

312
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,440
we're going to add the microbes the

313
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:45,880
recharge give it a good stir then we're

314
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,959
going to water the plants to a little

315
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:50,240
bit of runoff I want some water coming

316
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:51,958
out of the bottom of these pots um

317
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,639
enough to where we can actually collect

318
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:57,119
it and measure the EC and pH of that

319
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:59,720
runoff would be really cool uh so I

320
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:02,078
recommend mix Your solution uh check the

321
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:05,000
EC check the pH of that solution write

322
00:12:02,078 --> 00:12:06,799
that down water your plants get runoff

323
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,879
measure that runoff write that down as

324
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:11,719
well we'll deal with that in the future

325
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:14,039
what I want to do is I want to basically

326
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:15,759
reset the settings in that rizosphere

327
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:17,360
whatever is in there I want to water

328
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:19,720
that [ __ ] right on out and I want to

329
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,600
water it in with brand new feed

330
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,360
basically give it that whole new meal

331
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,959
whatever that last meal was it's sitting

332
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,320
in its gut I just want to push it out

333
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:28,799
with a new meal make all that stuff fall

334
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:31,079
right out and put a whole new dinner in

335
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:32,759
there so that it can start fresh that in

336
00:12:31,078 --> 00:12:34,399
my opinion is the way to restart

337
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:37,159
whatever plant you think needs to be

338
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:39,120
flushed because really that way we're

339
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:41,159
giving it everything it needs at the

340
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,639
proper dose at the proper pH and that's

341
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:44,439
the best thing you can give the plant

342
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,799
right the proper feed the proper

343
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:48,959
nutrients the proper ratios uh the

344
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:51,519
proper temperature hopefully the proper

345
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:54,000
pH give it everything that it needs and

346
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,639
fix it just reset that instead of

347
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,600
completely [ __ ] disrupting it and

348
00:12:55,639 --> 00:13:00,759
then trying to chase it because this

349
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:03,240
dude said uh pure water for two weeks at

350
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:04,879
the end of that two weeks everything is

351
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,039
going to be bright yellow everything's

352
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:08,278
going to be sad then you're going to

353
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:09,719
need to overfeed again then you're going

354
00:13:08,278 --> 00:13:11,039
to need to catch up with that and it's

355
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:14,879
just going to look worse it's going to

356
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:16,599
cause more problems so um I never flush

357
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:19,240
I think it causes more problems I would

358
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:22,000
feed with the Mel well- mixed solution

359
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:24,919
at the proper pH and try to achieve

360
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,320
approximately 20% runoff if you can so

361
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:28,879
that means if you poured a gallon of

362
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,278
water into that plant you want 20% of a

363
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:32,078
gallon gallon maybe a quarter of a

364
00:13:30,278 --> 00:13:33,399
gallon to come out of the bottom of that

365
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:35,479
plant then you want to scoop some of

366
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:38,679
that up and we will measure the EC and

367
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:40,759
pH of that if it's drastic high or low

368
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:42,958
then we will make adjustments if it came

369
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:45,159
out close to what it went in we're doing

370
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:46,719
okay if it's higher or lower we can

371
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:48,919
understand what's going on from there we

372
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,000
can make adjustments if necessary but

373
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:53,159
that's my long rant about why I do not

374
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,320
flush and why I would recommend mixing a

375
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:57,198
solid solution uh just imagine if you

376
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,480
didn't feel good like if you were sick

377
00:13:57,198 --> 00:14:00,758
like if you woke up tomorrow and you

378
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,199
just felt like complete [ __ ] would you

379
00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:04,039
do you think it would be more beneficial

380
00:14:02,198 --> 00:14:06,240
to your body to your health if you mixed

381
00:14:04,039 --> 00:14:07,679
up a tea and put some vitamins some

382
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,120
nutrients some minerals whatever you're

383
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:11,719
going for if it's an emergency packet or

384
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:14,000
if you actually go get some fruit and

385
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:15,759
juice and make a fruit juice anything

386
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,078
like that going into you is going to be

387
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:19,639
better than just water and you're just

388
00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:21,519
peeing out all your own vitamins your

389
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:23,198
own minerals your own nutrients you need

390
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:25,120
some electrolytes you need some vitamins

391
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:26,799
you need to be replenished so I think

392
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,600
your body would do a lot better if you

393
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:30,799
fed it a little bit instead of just

394
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:33,278
adding water and having to piss a lot I

395
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:35,078
think the plants are going to act very

396
00:14:33,278 --> 00:14:37,240
similarly we're going to push out all

397
00:14:35,078 --> 00:14:40,198
the the junk we don't want replace it

398
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:42,039
with stuff that we do desire you guys I

399
00:14:40,198 --> 00:14:44,078

recommend flushing ever unless you see

major major problems and still I would

411

452
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:34,680
question here in front of me this one

453
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:36,318
came from somebody who is going to be

454
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:38,599
called atlan

455
00:16:36,318 --> 00:16:40,479
415 feels like I've heard that somewhere

456
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,839
before big shout out my dude this

457
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,600
question oh also make sure you check

458
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:47,480
your inbox for that coupon code for the

459
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:50,800
free seeds at iir decom the question

460
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:52,600
goes a little bit like this it says I

461
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:55,039
have some general questions I wanted to

462
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:56,480
bounce off of you uh you sent me three

463
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:58,278
questions I'm only going to give you one

464
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:01,039
coupon code for one pack of seeds but I

465
00:16:58,278 --> 00:17:03,679
do appreciate the content it says light

466
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:07,318
leaks uh light leaks can wreak havoc on

467
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:09,438
an otherwise tuned in run how exactly do

468
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:11,720
outdoor grows deal with a light leak

469
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:14,160
that is a very good question I generally

470
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:15,919
address this question around the

471
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,000
beginning of outdoor season because

472
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:19,038
people are like hey I'm putting my

473
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,519
plants outside there's a street light

474
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:23,359
there's a [ __ ] porch light what's

475
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:26,199
going on this is a good question so

476
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:28,479
Outdoors why don't uh little lights

477
00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:30,840
disrupt our plants Outdoors let's see uh

478
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,798
outdoor grows deal with light leaks so a

479
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:35,399
light leak what is a light leak that is

480
00:17:32,798 --> 00:17:37,240
probably a good spot to start indoors a

481
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:39,440
light leak is what we call it when your

482
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:41,839
nighttime cycle in your grow environment

483
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:44,200
when it should be dark when that dark

484
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:45,599
cycle is interrupted and light gets in

485
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,960
there whether it's a little crack in

486
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:50,159
your um in your tent a little split in

487
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:51,840
your seams whether a door gets opened

488
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,960
whether a light gets left on that is a

489
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:56,519
light leak that can cause dri

490
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:59,038
detrimental issues to your garden uh

491
00:17:56,519 --> 00:18:01,000
depending on the frequency the power um

492
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:03,599
a lot of different factors of that light

493
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,038
the plants simply may not go into flower

494
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:07,798
uh it could cause them to express

495
00:18:05,038 --> 00:18:09,319
intersect traits it could wak havoc on

496
00:18:07,798 --> 00:18:11,639
everything or sometimes nothing could

497
00:18:09,319 --> 00:18:13,119
happen but so that is a light leak a

498
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:15,520
light leak is when the light gets into

499
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:18,199
your dark cycle now we put our plants

500
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:20,000
outdoors and we expect to get full

501
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:22,558
Darkness from the outdoor environment

502
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,640
and our plants should flower as usual

503
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:26,399
however we now live in society where

504
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,280
we've got a whole bunch of freaking

505
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,798
lights I don't know if it's your porch

506
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:31,879
light like I said earlier it could be a

507
00:18:29,798 --> 00:18:34,158
car driving by it could be a headlight

508
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:36,039
on a dude on a bike now it could be a

509
00:18:34,159 --> 00:18:38,240
[ __ ] drone with a bunch of spotlights

510
00:18:36,038 --> 00:18:40,158
on it there are light leaks and light

511
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,759
and darkness interruptions now happening

512
00:18:40,159 --> 00:18:44,440
to our plants Outdoors why don't those

513
00:18:42,759 --> 00:18:46,279
plants and also we've got the moon let's

514
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:48,038
not forget about that big old Skylight

515
00:18:46,279 --> 00:18:50,279
that a lot of us use to walk our path at

516
00:18:48,038 --> 00:18:52,759
night the moon Nature's favorite light

517
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:54,599
the moon out there um why isn't that

518
00:18:52,759 --> 00:18:57,000
light [ __ ] up our garden that's all a

519
00:18:54,599 --> 00:19:00,519
very good question the first quickest

520
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,880
answer is phytochrome red so let's talk

521
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:04,319
about this when the Sun is setting when

522
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,799
the sun is going down and also I've got

523
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:08,319
another theory we'll touch on this with

524
00:19:05,798 --> 00:19:10,879
as the sun sets it starts to put off a

525
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:13,279
spe it doesn't put off when the sun sets

526
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:15,360
it hits the atmosphere in a way that it

527
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:17,918
creates a spectrum of light known as far

528
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:19,879
red lighting it is a spectrum of light

529
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:23,120
that triggers our plants to do what is

530
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:24,919
called a phytochrome red response so

531
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:26,479
this the Sun comes to a certain angle of

532
00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:28,480
the atmosphere it creates a certain

533
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,839
color a certain spectrum of lighting

534
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:33,159
that lighting hits our plants that light

535
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:34,678
that color of that light tells our plant

536
00:19:33,159 --> 00:19:36,679
hey it's sleepy time I should go nigh

537
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:38,400
night that's why sometimes outside at

538
00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:39,880
the outdoor grows you will see your

539
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,720
plants their leaves are up and perky

540
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:44,120
they're going and as the sun begins to

541
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:46,400
set they will go and you'll go oh the

542
00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:48,239
plants know it's nighttime yes they do

543
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,559
because they are getting far red

544
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,960
lighting which is triggering a

545
00:19:49,558 --> 00:19:53,319
phytochrome response in those plants

546
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:55,400
that is telling them hey it's time for

547
00:19:53,319 --> 00:19:57,558
me to go to sleep and when those plants

548
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:59,240
are tucked in by the far red lighting

549
00:19:57,558 --> 00:20:01,319
they sleep mud

550
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:03,279
more deeply than they would in your

551
00:20:01,319 --> 00:20:05,480
basic grow room when you're going from

552
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:07,879
an LED light with [ __ ] six different

553
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:11,599
colors that was made up by man to

554
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:13,159
Darkness um maybe a th000 watt LED light

555
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:16,000
in there is probably what most of us are

556
00:20:13,159 --> 00:20:18,640
running in a 5x5 so you got 1,000 watts

557
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,919
of light uh just a little mix Spectrum

558
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,799
uh that's really cool for your plants

559
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:24,240
it's working really well and when that

560
00:20:21,798 --> 00:20:26,798
goes off it's pure pure Darkness but

561
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:29,200
compare that to the power of the sun

562
00:20:26,798 --> 00:20:30,918
when that sun is cooking it is the

563
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,720
perfect Spectrum for your plants it's

564
00:20:30,919 --> 00:20:34,360
the most powerful Spectrum no light

565
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,360
meter will ever measure how much sun

566
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:38,839
we're getting uh compared to a grow

567
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:41,158
light so all that sunlight compared to

568
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:43,439
your grow light is such a vast

569
00:20:41,159 --> 00:20:44,919
difference so when that sunlight uh

570
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,960
tells those plants hey it's time to go

571
00:20:44,919 --> 00:20:48,919
to sleep compared to your grow light

572
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:52,159
it's like giving them a quadruple dose

573
00:20:48,919 --> 00:20:54,480
of Nyquil versus just going sweet dreams

574
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:55,760
kids it's such a big big difference so

575
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,200
that's why light leaks are so

576
00:20:55,759 --> 00:21:00,720
detrimental indoors and can cause such

577
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:03,080
major problems but Outdoors the plants

578
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:05,319
can take a lot more light problems

579
00:21:03,079 --> 00:21:07,480
because that far red light has tucked

580
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:09,200
them in and they're sleeping they're in

581
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,720
their they've been comos they've been

582
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,919
tucked in real tight they've been given

583
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,759
that double dose of Nyquil they took a

584
00:21:12,919 --> 00:21:16,840
fat dab they rubbed one out they got a

585
00:21:14,759 --> 00:21:18,919
full tummy they're [ __ ] sleeping

586
00:21:16,839 --> 00:21:20,879
they're not going to wake up until that

587
00:21:18,919 --> 00:21:22,880
opposite Spectrum happens when the Sun

588
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,360
rises it creates a blue and wide

589
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,000
spectrum that tells those plants hey

590
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:27,599
[ __ ] it's time to wake up and get to

591
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,359
work and you'll see the leaves the

592
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:31,639
leaves will start swimming they'll start

593
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:33,558
perking up and start doing their day uh

594
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:37,000
that's what happens with that blue light

595
00:21:33,558 --> 00:21:39,000
from the sun as it begins to rise so uh

596
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,319
the main factor is that far red lighting

597
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,839
tells them hey go to sleep and then

598
00:21:41,319 --> 00:21:45,759
they're soundly tucked in and the second

599
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:47,639
factor is your little flashlight your

600
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:50,119
little headlight on the car does not

601
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:52,278
compare at all to the Sun that it's used

602
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:54,158
to seeing so uh that's like just pulling

603
00:21:52,278 --> 00:21:55,960
the curtain open a little bit and just

604
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:57,320
going hey there's a little LED light out

605
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:59,440
there the plant's going to go yeah a

606
00:21:57,319 --> 00:22:00,798
little LED whatever if you pull open the

607
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,038
curtains on the sun's up we're all going

608
00:22:00,798 --> 00:22:04,240
to go ah [ __ ] the sun's up that's the

609
00:22:03,038 --> 00:22:06,798
big difference about it different

610
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:09,240
Spectrum different uh intensity uh

611
00:22:06,798 --> 00:22:11,519
different overall kind of light so the

612
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:15,038
first answer far red the second answer

613
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:16,798
is that major difference in intensity

614
00:22:15,038 --> 00:22:18,158
now there are two more parts to this

615
00:22:16,798 --> 00:22:21,558
question which is fun because I'm quite

616
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:23,799
rambly Today part number two or number B

617
00:22:21,558 --> 00:22:26,158
if you want to uh do you have any

618
00:22:23,798 --> 00:22:28,798
personal experience with World plants

619
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:30,278
World plants that is when uh your leaves

620
00:22:28,798 --> 00:22:32,038
that should be sticking straight out and

621
00:22:30,278 --> 00:22:34,400
kind of doing this that's when they look

622
00:22:32,038 --> 00:22:35,679
like they're curling they're getting uh

623
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,600
they're just twisting all over each

624
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:39,720
other the leaves are twisting World

625
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:41,079
means twisting leaves so if the leaves

626
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,720
look like they're spinning around you

627
00:22:41,079 --> 00:22:45,439
got a tornado plant that's what we're

628
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:48,480
talking about most of the time in my

629
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:51,400
experience that is a light problem most

630
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:54,200
of the time 99% of the time that is a

631
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:55,880
light um like a REV process so you've

632
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:57,600
gotten you've given the plant more light

633
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:59,039
than you were you've increased the

634
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:00,879
amount of hours

635
00:22:59,038 --> 00:23:02,519
that the the plant is receiving light

636
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,200
that was harder to say than it looked

637
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:08,038
but you do podcasting you'll figure it

638
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:12,000
out uh that plant probably went from um

639
00:23:08,038 --> 00:23:14,038
we'll say 186 to 240 and that lack of

640
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,240
sleep made that plant go what the [ __ ]

641
00:23:14,038 --> 00:23:20,079
and it starting to spin around or it was

642
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:21,359
on 1212 and you put it on 186 or 240 and

643
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:23,558
now those leaves are starting to twist

644
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:26,278
and curl going I don't know what to do

645
00:23:23,558 --> 00:23:29,678
so most of the time that world uh plant

646
00:23:26,278 --> 00:23:32,240
the world leaves come from too much or a

647
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:34,038
changed light cycle an increased light

648
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,278
cycle is generally what I've noticed

649
00:23:34,038 --> 00:23:37,759
that from it could be other things most

650
00:23:36,278 --> 00:23:39,519
of the time you're going to find that it

651
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:42,200
is a lighting issue because it's kind of

652
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:45,038
a hormonal thing uh which 90% of the

653
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:47,080
time does come from the lighting so you

654
00:23:45,038 --> 00:23:49,519
probably changed the timer and that

655
00:23:47,079 --> 00:23:52,480
plant went [ __ ] nuts or gave it too

656
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:55,599
much light now there is a part three

657
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:59,038
number c it says when using some type of

658
00:23:55,599 --> 00:24:01,278
chemical induced method for creating

659
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:03,119
pollen from female plants all right so

660
00:24:01,278 --> 00:24:05,038
when I'm making silver tho sulfate is

661
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:08,038
what they're being specific about and

662
00:24:05,038 --> 00:24:09,440
deciding to do open air pollination so

663
00:24:08,038 --> 00:24:11,640
I'm going to reverse a plant and let

664
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,840
that pollen fly into the air what type

665
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:15,559
of spacing do you give male and female

666
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:17,199
plants during the tail end of the

667
00:24:15,558 --> 00:24:19,678
chemical schedule okay I see what you're

668
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:23,278
saying where the plants will be into

669
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:26,880
pre-flow if not flower um so I see what

670
00:24:23,278 --> 00:24:28,480
you're saying um and you have kind of

671
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,559
overthought it there's no time on that

672
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,839
overlaps there's no overlapping in this

673
00:24:30,558 --> 00:24:36,240
period what this viewer listener

674
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:38,240
questioner is asking um I treat a plant

675
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,599
with silver tho sulfate so I've got a

676
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,319
plant I treat it with silver tho sulfate

677
00:24:40,599 --> 00:24:44,439
I will treat it seven times over the

678
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:45,678
course of its life maybe eight or nine

679
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:47,600
that's Up For Debate but it's going to

680
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:49,960
get seven solid treatments of this

681
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:52,558
sprayed application of silver tho

682
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:54,319
sulfate then after that it is going to

683
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:57,798
get moved to another room to pollinate

684
00:24:54,319 --> 00:25:00,278
some female plants this person is asking

685
00:24:57,798 --> 00:25:02,240
um how much space do I give the male and

686
00:25:00,278 --> 00:25:05,000
female plants during that tail end where

687
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,440
the plants will be into pre-flow and not

688
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:10,159
flow or and

689
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:13,320
flow um are those chemicals transferable

690
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:15,640
to nearby plants by the air and if to if

691
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:18,079
so what to extent So it's b these the

692
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:20,600
product I use is uh it's water-based so

693
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:21,879
I'm spraying a water a liquid product on

694
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:24,319
there it's not really in the air it's

695
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:28,320
not a gas it's a liquid so I'm able to

696
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:30,720
maintain it um I've got so basically

697
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:32,278
I've got a 5x5 tent in one section of

698
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:35,440
the room and in the other corner of the

699
00:25:32,278 --> 00:25:38,159
room is a 3X3 with the reversals I keep

700
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:40,080
them separate for timing purposes but I

701
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:42,559
basically take the reversal candidate

702
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:44,480
out of the tent and it sets right in the

703
00:25:42,558 --> 00:25:46,839
corner the other corner of the room and

704
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:49,519
I apply the silver thyo sulfate uh

705
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:51,599
sprayed application to it way over there

706
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:53,960
it's a spray it's a liquid spray so it's

707
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:55,558
not like really Airborne uh I'm not

708
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:57,519
getting that fine of mist I'm just using

709
00:25:55,558 --> 00:25:59,480
a [ __ ] spray bottle like you'd use to

710
00:25:57,519 --> 00:26:01,000
clean the window it's the same I buy

711
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:03,480
those from Uline I could see a box of

712
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:06,319
them I just buy those from Uline and I

713
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:08,558
makes up a 10% and a 30% silver thio

714
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:10,398
sufate and I got two plants one's marked

715
00:26:08,558 --> 00:26:11,558
with the 10 one's marked with the 30

716
00:26:10,398 --> 00:26:14,158
they're sitting over there and I just

717
00:26:11,558 --> 00:26:16,639
spray them and I don't spray willy-nilly

718
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:18,799
where the spray is going everywhere so

719
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,600
just right behind that plant which is a

720
00:26:18,798 --> 00:26:23,000
white wall is all that's getting hit

721
00:26:20,599 --> 00:26:24,879
with my overs spray so it's not really

722
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,038
going anywhere and then I let it dry

723
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:29,000
completely before I put it back into the

724
00:26:27,038 --> 00:26:30,679
tent because sorry my computer just went

725
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,759
to screen saver and I need my notes here

726
00:26:30,679 --> 00:26:35,278
man there we go um I let it dry before

727
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:37,558
it goes back into the tent because um I

728
00:26:35,278 --> 00:26:39,119
don't want the 10 and the 30% dilutions

729
00:26:37,558 --> 00:26:41,158
touching each other because I don't want

730
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:42,798
to get confused on which uh dilution

731
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:45,360
works because I'm making notes on what

732
00:26:42,798 --> 00:26:46,558
to use in the future so I let them dry

733
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:48,359
because also I don't want them under the

734
00:26:46,558 --> 00:26:49,879
light when they're wet that's not good

735
00:26:48,359 --> 00:26:53,639
so I let them dry before they go back

736
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:58,399
into the tent and then that process

737
00:26:53,640 --> 00:27:03,000
concludes around day 21 or day 24 and I

738
00:26:58,398 --> 00:27:06,239
do not do my pollination until about day

739
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:08,960
uh and so also that process starts um

740
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:11,038
two weeks ahead before the other plants

741
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:14,200
so there's only a time period of two

742
00:27:11,038 --> 00:27:16,158
weeks when this plant is being sprayed

743
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:18,759
or a week one week when this plant is

744
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:22,120
being sprayed and the females are in

745
00:27:18,759 --> 00:27:23,839
flour and then I stop spraying that one

746
00:27:22,119 --> 00:27:26,119
and he starts creating pollen she

747
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:28,798
creates pollen and it's been hasn't been

748
00:27:26,119 --> 00:27:31,558
sprayed for 7 days before I move it to

749
00:27:28,798 --> 00:27:33,038
the other room at least 7 Days uh in

750
00:27:31,558 --> 00:27:34,918
this situation it's taking a minute for

751
00:27:33,038 --> 00:27:36,960
my girls one of them isn't showing

752
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:38,840
enough pistol so I'm uh hesitating on

753
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,600
the pollination but it's going to be a

754
00:27:38,839 --> 00:27:43,519
week or two weeks since I've sprayed

755
00:27:40,599 --> 00:27:45,359
before the pollination even happens um I

756
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:47,440
quit spraying I'm trying to do the math

757
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:49,479
here so let's just say hypothetically I

758
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,600
started spraying silver tho sulfate on

759
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:56,679
December 1st then I would have sprayed

760
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:59,839
at the first third uh 1 3 6 9 12 15 18

761
00:27:56,679 --> 00:28:01,038
21 up to the 21st of December the that

762
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:03,240
plant would have gotten sprayed with

763
00:28:01,038 --> 00:28:05,720
silver tho sulfate so we got 21 days of

764
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:09,399
spray then I honestly did not put the

765
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:11,600
females into flow until the 16th of

766
00:28:09,398 --> 00:28:13,119
December I gave them two weeks uh

767
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:15,158
advance I gave the mail the pollen

768
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:17,119
donors a two week Head Start to get

769
00:28:15,159 --> 00:28:19,278
building up their pollen then I put the

770
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:20,879
females into flower kind of should have

771
00:28:19,278 --> 00:28:22,200
timed that about 3 or five days

772
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,960
different now that I'm seeing what's

773
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:27,919
going on but they didn't know um so they

774
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:30,399
were into flower 21 days in uh then they

775
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:33,320
went went to flower 16 days in so that

776
00:28:30,398 --> 00:28:35,158
means that 5 days in to the flowering

777
00:28:33,319 --> 00:28:37,720
process of the females I stopped

778
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:40,159
applying sprayed solutions to the pollen

779
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:43,880
donors and they will not receive pollen

780
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:46,000
for probably 10 12 14 days after that

781
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:48,159
maybe even more so there's going to be a

782
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,119
three or 4 week time I think if I time

783
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:52,278
that properly where there's no sprayed

784
00:28:50,119 --> 00:28:53,918
application in the room at all before

785
00:28:52,278 --> 00:28:57,200
those female plants will receive the

786
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:58,679
pollen and there was no overspray so

787
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,960
those females will not be exposed to

788
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:03,960
Silver thyo sufate in any way at all and

789
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:05,278
if they were they're not going to get

790
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:07,000
smoked none of that is going to get

791
00:29:05,278 --> 00:29:09,798
smoked nothing in that room will be

792
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:12,079
consumed it is all seeded material so

793
00:29:09,798 --> 00:29:14,480
the plants that got sprayed they are

794
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:16,000
fully pollen donors uh they will get

795
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,960
chopped and moved over to the other room

796
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,398
and [ __ ] sprinkled all over once

797
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:20,840
those plants are done donating their

798
00:29:19,398 --> 00:29:23,359
pollen everywhere they get cut into

799
00:29:20,839 --> 00:29:25,158
small pieces put into a compost bin uh

800
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:26,719
they are gone they're done the boy

801
00:29:25,159 --> 00:29:27,799
plants are the female pollen donors

802
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,079
they're removed from the room they're

803
00:29:27,798 --> 00:29:31,720
not even a thought anymore uh and then

804
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:33,319
those female plants they've received

805
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:35,679
pollen none of that's going to get

806
00:29:33,319 --> 00:29:38,119
smoked it is all loaded with seeds if I

807
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:40,440
do it correctly there's nothing smokable

808
00:29:38,119 --> 00:29:42,239
so um there's been no overspray and

809
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:45,679
there's been a long time Gap so there's

810
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:48,038
no uh concern for chemical what's the

811
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:50,759
word you're using uh chemical methods

812
00:29:48,038 --> 00:29:53,240
transferable no chemical transference to

813
00:29:50,759 --> 00:29:55,038
nearby plants by air and to what extent

814
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:56,960
so um it's a good idea but I think

815
00:29:55,038 --> 00:30:00,200
you're kind of overthinking it uh

816
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:02,519
there's a Time Gap uh day 21 is when I

817
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:04,640
quit spraying and that's like day five

818
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:06,000
of when I put the other girls into flow

819
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:08,320
and they're not going to get pollen in

820
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,240
for like 20 days from that so there's

821
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:12,519
like a a nice period from when the

822
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:14,278
pollen has been flying to or when the

823
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:16,640
Silver's been flying to when the pollen

824
00:30:14,278 --> 00:30:18,278
flies and a big space in the room all

825
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:20,000
