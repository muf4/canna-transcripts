00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:46,920
appreciate that I'm glad that soma

104
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:49,799
inspired you and started a lot of your

105
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:51,659
teachings because uh I was hanging out

106
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:52,980
with a friend who grew weed for several

107
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:54,180
years and we were talking about my crops

108
00:03:52,979 --> 00:03:56,548
and he said dude you know who you really

109
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:58,019
remind me of was a guy named soma and at

110
00:03:56,549 --> 00:03:59,489
the time I'd never heard of soma so I

111
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:02,700
went home and of course I googled soma

112
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:04,769
and uh someone I have a lot of the same

113
00:04:02,699 --> 00:04:06,810
philosophies a lot of the same practices

114
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:09,629
we agree a lot so I've learned a lot

115
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:12,479
from soma I kind of used some asuma's

116
00:04:09,629 --> 00:04:14,789
methods but mostly his ideals uh he

117
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:16,709
almost treats plants is like a religion

118
00:04:14,789 --> 00:04:18,689
sort of you know he's his religion is

119
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:20,488
growing pot and I took that spiritual

120
00:04:18,689 --> 00:04:22,319
aspect of growing pot I had that before

121
00:04:20,488 --> 00:04:24,418
I ever knew about soma so I kind of I

122
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:26,579
multiplied on it or expanded on it once

123
00:04:24,418 --> 00:04:28,529

167
00:05:44,459 --> 00:05:48,329
worm farm I'm also going to talk a

168
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:50,760
little bit about my company I read

169
00:05:48,329 --> 00:05:53,250
genetics and I'll also talk a little bit

170
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:54,689
about feminized seeds I've gotten a lot

171
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:56,459
of emails about feminized seeds I'll

172
00:05:54,689 --> 00:05:59,040
explain my method of making those a

173
00:05:56,459 --> 00:06:00,659
little later in the show now let's start

174
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,819
with the Rocky Mountain worm company

175
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,990
last week I was invited to go visit the

176
00:06:02,819 --> 00:06:04,889
Rocky Mountain worm company and they

177
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:07,290
gave me a little tour of the building

178
00:06:04,889 --> 00:06:09,569
and I got to see where the worm castings

179
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:11,340
are made they don't have a giant

180
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:13,319
facility but what they do have is super

181
00:06:11,339 --> 00:06:15,478
clean and super organized and I was

182
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:17,610
pretty impressed I got to hang out with

183
00:06:15,478 --> 00:06:19,769
J and Sean and Alan for a few minutes

184
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:22,229
and they taught me a lot about worms and

185
00:06:19,769 --> 00:06:24,180
worm castings and why they use specific

186
00:06:22,228 --> 00:06:26,189
worms that they use to make the worm

187
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:27,990
castings some worms you guys only eat

188
00:06:26,189 --> 00:06:30,269
the top layer of if you put them in a

189
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:32,040
big thing of dirt like if it's a field

190
00:06:30,269 --> 00:06:33,990
of dirt or if it's just a bucket full of

191
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:35,610
dirt they will only eat the top layer

192
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:37,500
and they don't dig down these guys

193
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:39,240
actually know which worms eat the top

194
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,819
which worms at the bottom they know that

195
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,120
some worms will eat every layer some

196
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:43,379
worms

197
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,209
travel through all of the dirt or

198
00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:48,360
whatever you're putting them in and they

199
00:06:45,209 --> 00:06:49,918
will eat and digest all of that these

200
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,960
guys these guys knew a lot about their

201
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:54,000
worms they showed me worms in every

202
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:55,799
single stage of growth every single

203
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,689
stage of life they have to kind of keep

204
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,949
the worms and five gallon buckets and

205
00:06:57,689 --> 00:07:00,478
they let me open the buckets with the

206
00:06:58,949 --> 00:07:02,610
worm farms and them I get to feel the

207
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:05,250
texture of the medium in which the worms

208
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:07,199
live in it's kind of Airy its kind of

209
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:09,149
fluffy it feels a lot like the soil that

210
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,319
I mix for my plants one thing that I

211
00:07:09,149 --> 00:07:12,779
thought was really cool is what they're

212
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,339
feeding the worms this is really cool in

213
00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:18,359
my opinion

214
00:07:14,339 --> 00:07:19,619
parts of the worm diet is ah dried and

215
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:22,740
ground herb from a company called

216
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:25,350
o.penvape open vape makes vapor pen

217
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:27,960
cartridges so they're using their

218
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:30,060
extracting the CBD or THC from a plant

219
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:32,339
and making oil out of it and then they

220
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:34,740
send all the leftover material to the

221
00:07:32,339 --> 00:07:37,589
worm company to feed the worms so the

222
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:39,629
worm company is using ground-up plant

223
00:07:37,589 --> 00:07:42,329
stocks and leaves and whatever else was

224
00:07:39,629 --> 00:07:44,038
left for the plants after harvest after

225
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:47,098
the making oil part happened and they're

226
00:07:44,038 --> 00:07:49,228
feeding the ground-up plant matter back

227
00:07:47,098 --> 00:07:51,120
to the worms and then the worms are

228
00:07:49,228 --> 00:07:53,250
making castings at vat and those

229
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,680
castings are being used to grow my

230
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:57,029
cannabis and probably those worm

231
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,590
castings hopefully make it back to

232
00:07:57,029 --> 00:08:01,168
o.penvape and go back into their

233
00:07:58,589 --> 00:08:03,089
cannabis so we're kind of doing like an

234
00:08:01,168 --> 00:08:06,750
in-house recycling sort of thing it goes

235
00:08:03,089 --> 00:08:08,189
full circle uh without us creating more

236
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:09,538
stuff without something being tossed

237
00:08:08,189 --> 00:08:11,990
into a dumpster for the trash guy to

238
00:08:09,538 --> 00:08:14,519
find imagine when you harvest you have

239
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:16,918
every plant has a stalk and stems and

240
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:19,259
leaves imagine if you let that dry grind

241
00:08:16,918 --> 00:08:20,909
it up and had some worms to feed that to

242
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:22,199
you wouldn't have to throw all that away

243
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:24,960
and you wouldn't have to make so many

244
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:26,460
trips to the dump or wherever ah that's

245
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:30,779
just super efficient I was completely

246
00:08:26,459 --> 00:08:32,490
impressed so let's see I want to give a

247
00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:34,468
huge shout out to Jay and Sean and Alan

248
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:36,750
and Nick I really like hanging out with

249
00:08:34,469 --> 00:08:38,729
those guys the worm Factory is a cool

250
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:40,049
place I'll definitely be back there soon

251
00:08:38,729 --> 00:08:41,550
those guys threw a handful of products

252
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:43,139
my way and I'm kind of starting to

253
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:45,479
implement them in my grow I have to

254
00:08:43,139 --> 00:08:46,799
slowly adjust from the organic or from

255
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,879
the non-organic bottled stuff to the

256
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:50,129
organics because I don't want to ruin

257
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:51,328
the organic stuff so I'm learning what I

258
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:52,919
can switch out and what I can use

259
00:08:51,328 --> 00:08:55,229
together and these guys are definitely

260
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:55,799
definitely definitely moving me along

261
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:57,480
quickly

262
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:59,399
I've been feeding the my plants worm

263
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:01,619
castings for about a month now and I can

264
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:03,688
definitely see an improvement in my

265
00:09:01,619 --> 00:09:05,519
crops the first thing I noticed I would

266
00:09:03,688 --> 00:09:07,860
say that after introducing worm castings

267
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:10,528
and grow Kashi is that my plants are

268
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:12,269
just simply more active they look more

269
00:09:10,528 --> 00:09:14,639
vigorous they look happier they're

270
00:09:12,269 --> 00:09:16,198
greener I see more growth and they also

271
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:17,519
seem to want more water which tells me

272
00:09:16,198 --> 00:09:19,318
they're growing and taking nutrients

273
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:22,379
more than before so I definitely

274
00:09:19,318 --> 00:09:24,778
encourage the use of grow Kashi and worm

275
00:09:22,379 --> 00:09:29,039
castings as a nice way to just start

276
00:09:24,778 --> 00:09:30,178
leaning toward the organics yeah so I

277
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:32,879
feel like I've been talking about them

278
00:09:30,178 --> 00:09:34,289
for a little bit let's see if you want

279
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:36,839
to learn more about the worm company I

280

you guys can't get enough of that place

291
00:09:56,339 --> 00:10:00,660
another thing I want to talk about is

292
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:02,938
Irie genetics I've got I get a couple of

293
00:10:00,659 --> 00:10:04,198
emails every week about I read genetics

294
00:10:02,938 --> 00:10:06,539
with questions about I read genetic

295
00:10:04,198 --> 00:10:08,008
stuff and somebody just asked me why I

296
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:11,338
don't talk about IRA genetics on the

297
00:10:08,009 --> 00:10:12,990
podcast um the show isn't really about

298
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:14,699
IRA genetics the show is about canis

299
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:16,409
cannabis in general so I not try not to

300
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:18,688
focus too much on my own company but it

301
00:10:16,409 --> 00:10:20,519
seems like you guys are interested so I

302
00:10:18,688 --> 00:10:21,568
guess it seems fair that I talk about it

303
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:25,188
a little bit I turned out to toot my own

304
00:10:21,568 --> 00:10:25,188
horn gonna take a sip here sorry hold on

305
00:10:25,999 --> 00:10:30,720
alright um so let's talk about IRA

306
00:10:28,589 --> 00:10:33,990
genetics I guess let's jump into this um

307
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:36,629
I read genetics is of course my seed

308
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:38,818
company I breed regular and feminized

309
00:10:36,629 --> 00:10:40,289
cannabis seeds right now I read genetics

310
00:10:38,818 --> 00:10:42,418
is pretty much sold out of seeds for the

311
00:10:40,289 --> 00:10:44,188
most part nature's green remedies is my

312
00:10:42,418 --> 00:10:46,860
main distributor and they got most of

313
00:10:44,188 --> 00:10:48,480
what I had left over after I hooked up

314
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:50,579
most of my local friends with my latest

315
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:54,149
harvest I really like to get the locals

316
00:10:50,578 --> 00:10:55,769
ah all my friends all my Colorado I mean

317
00:10:54,149 --> 00:10:57,899
my company is called IRA genetics

318
00:10:55,769 --> 00:11:00,749
Colorado Colorado is what allowed me to

319
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:03,058
become this breeder I feel like the

320
00:11:00,749 --> 00:11:04,918
local people should get the IRA genetics

321
00:11:03,058 --> 00:11:06,269
products first and that way I get to see

322
00:11:04,918 --> 00:11:08,429
what they grow and I get to take

323
00:11:06,269 --> 00:11:10,139
pictures of it I can take clones of it

324
00:11:08,429 --> 00:11:11,579
so I'm not trying to be rude about it

325
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:12,059
but the locals always get served up

326
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,950
first

327
00:11:12,059 --> 00:11:16,049
after I feel like everybody's gotten

328
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:17,790
their seeds make sure nature's green

329
00:11:16,049 --> 00:11:20,579
remedies gets what they can what they

330
00:11:17,789 --> 00:11:22,620
can do so I really can't make enough

331
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:24,270
seeds to meet the demand lately honestly

332
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:25,769
I'm going to make more golden goat limit

333
00:11:24,269 --> 00:11:28,199
geoffery seeds here really soon

334
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:30,509
the boys for that project are actually

335
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,770
in flower when you make femme seeds or

336
00:11:30,509 --> 00:11:33,120
seeds in general you got to start the

337
00:11:31,769 --> 00:11:35,069
boys off a little bit ahead of the

338
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,690
females so the males aren't flower now

339
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:39,480
the girls will go on flower and a couple

340
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:41,790
few days those should be ready in about

341
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:44,009
90 days from now I think this episode

342
00:11:41,789 --> 00:11:46,169
will come out March 1st or 2nd and 90

343
00:11:44,009 --> 00:11:50,069
days from then I should have lemon

344
00:11:46,169 --> 00:11:51,629
Geoffrey and um golden goat seeds

345
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:52,890
available I actually wrote down the

346
00:11:51,629 --> 00:11:54,659
wrong screen and I will set the wrong

347
00:11:52,889 --> 00:11:55,710
strain and teach you guys but yes I'm

348
00:11:54,659 --> 00:11:57,269
making more lemon Geoffrey and I'm

349
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:59,220
making more golden goat right now they

350
00:11:57,269 --> 00:12:00,809
should be ready in about 90 days the

351
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:02,460
locals will get them first there is no

352
00:12:00,809 --> 00:12:04,919
waiting list there's not a way to get on

353
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:07,019
a waiting list right now after my locals

354
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:08,459
get served up they will be dished out to

355
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:10,470
nature's green remedies and nature's

356
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:12,300
green remedies calm will sell out

357
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:13,649
quickly I promise you that I'll make an

358
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:15,689
announcement on this show before they go

359
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:17,220
there so when I make those lemon

360
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:19,200
Geoffrey and the golden goats I'm also

361
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:21,509
going to put a new cut called Kalonji

362
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:25,020
cush in their Kalonji cush is the

363
00:12:21,509 --> 00:12:27,059
Grateful dog pollinated the Tahoe og and

364
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:28,799
I call it Kalonji cush after a reggae

365
00:12:27,059 --> 00:12:29,969
artist named sizzla Kalonji if you're

366
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:32,309
wondering where my weird names come from

367
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:34,740
Kalonji is a reggae artist Sizzla

368
00:12:32,309 --> 00:12:37,229
Kalonji so I'm gonna cross the golden

369
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:39,480
goat to the sizzle of Kalonji and I want

370
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:42,300
to call that sunshine girl which I is

371
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:44,430
actually a Sizzla song so I think that's

372
00:12:42,299 --> 00:12:45,629
gonna be pretty cute um I have a couple

373
00:12:44,429 --> 00:12:47,339
more ideas that I'm going to put in that

374
00:12:45,629 --> 00:12:48,779
room I have two more females that are

375
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:50,670
going in there for sure but I don't want

376
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:52,289
to talk too much about them until I've

377
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:55,319
got some seeds in my hands from those

378
00:12:52,289 --> 00:12:57,779
because um man let me tell you weird

379
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:59,670
side story one time I reversed a golden

380
00:12:57,779 --> 00:13:02,069
Goa plant a female golden Goa planet I

381
00:12:59,669 --> 00:13:03,209
treated it I turned it into a male and

382
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:04,620
I'll talk more about that later in the

383
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:06,480
show how he do that but I turned this

384
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:09,029
female plant into a male right and it

385
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,830
created pollen and I put that pollen on

386
00:13:09,029 --> 00:13:12,720
a roomful of plants and that's how I

387
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:14,820
created the lemon Jeffrey that's how I

388
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,050
made golden goat seeds there was another

389
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,670
cross in the room that's never been

390
00:13:16,049 --> 00:13:19,839
released or shown to anybody because it

391
00:13:17,669 --> 00:13:22,479
only made a few seeds and those are mine

392
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:25,300
I also sprinkled that pollen on another

393
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,680
plant arm the strain was headband it was

394
00:13:25,299 --> 00:13:28,719
a headband cut that I got from my good

395
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:31,179
buddy hankie B he gave me that headband

396
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,950
cut I sprinkled pollen on it and when

397
00:13:31,179 --> 00:13:36,219
that plant took the pollen the plant

398
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:37,750
died within 24 hours that plant was dead

399
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:39,580
every other plant in the room was

400
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:41,200
healthy and happy took the pollen it

401
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:42,910
showed signs of being pollinated just

402
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:45,400
like it should have I don't know what

403
00:13:42,909 --> 00:13:47,679
went wrong but that headband plant died

404
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:49,750
within 24 hours of taking feminized

405
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:51,338
pollen I've never seen that from a plant

406
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:53,230
I've never heard of that from a plant

407
00:13:51,339 --> 00:13:54,760
I've talked to other breeders nobody has

408
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:56,528
an explanation for that the plant was

409
00:13:54,759 --> 00:13:58,000
healthy everything was cool I don't know

410
00:13:56,528 --> 00:13:59,379
what the hell happened so I'm gonna put

411
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,299
another headband in there and I'm gonna

412
00:13:59,379 --> 00:14:03,370
hit it with golden goat pollen again and

413
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:04,539
I've got a name for it but I'm hesitant

414
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:06,759
to say on the show because people are

415
00:14:04,539 --> 00:14:08,199
gonna rip me off but if I say it then no

416
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:10,750
one can steal it from me Rex I'm saying

417
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:13,240
it the golden goat is going to pollinate

418
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:15,700
the headband plant and I will call it as

419
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:17,230
a halo you know right you see you got a

420
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,650
headband and now it's gold it's above

421
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:19,480
your head

422
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:21,399
that's the halo bro so that's what I

423
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:24,129
think I'm gonna call the headband to the

424
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:25,269
gold and go the halo the Kalonji cush to

425
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:27,338
the golden goat will be the sunshine

426
00:14:25,269 --> 00:14:28,960
girl those are coming up you guys about

427
00:14:27,339 --> 00:14:30,220
90 days so pay attention I'll need some

428
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,780
testers but I didn't say that on the

429
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:33,009
show

430
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:34,959
let's see more about IRA genetics I

431
00:14:33,009 --> 00:14:39,309
recently started my work on making black

432
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:40,839
cherry Kim f2 seeds f2 is finial

433
00:14:39,309 --> 00:14:43,299
generation so I made the F ones right

434
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:45,490
that's plush berry was pollinated by a

435
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:47,919
Daybreaker plant and the seeds that came

436
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:50,730
out of there were called f1 the first

437
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:53,529
finial generation of that cross so now I

438
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:55,240
grew a bunch of them out and I found the

439
00:14:53,529 --> 00:14:57,490
male that I want and I've recently found

440
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:59,320
three females that are good candidates

441
00:14:57,490 --> 00:15:01,029
for breeding so I'm waiting for these

442
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:02,320
plants to finish before I commit to

443
00:15:01,029 --> 00:15:04,659
which females I'm going to use to

444
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:07,240
continue the line into f2 but once I

445
00:15:04,659 --> 00:15:08,409
choose one I'm going to I'm going to

446
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,000
choose two of them actually and I'm

447
00:15:08,409 --> 00:15:11,949
going to hit both of them with the male

448
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,669
pollen and then I will keep all of the

449
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:17,110
seeds separate so that its phenotype

450
00:15:15,669 --> 00:15:18,969
number seven and eight or the two that

451
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:20,440
I'm really eyeballing for my females so

452
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:21,850
I'll keep black cherry chem seven and

453
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:23,200
black cherry chem eight separate and

454
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:25,450
pull all the seeds out and I'll grow a

455
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:27,490
hundred of each one of those and see

456
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:29,110
which one shows me what I like and it

457
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:31,480
will keep that one to continue working

458
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:32,860
with so I went for these plants to

459
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,550
finish I got to smoke them I got to dry

460
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:35,019
them I got a

461
00:15:33,549 --> 00:15:36,309
turn some of it into ABS I got to smoke

462
00:15:35,019 --> 00:15:38,259
some of it is flour I got to see which

463
00:15:36,309 --> 00:15:41,799
one I really liked the best and then

464
00:15:38,259 --> 00:15:44,080
that will be used to make the f3 and I'm

465
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:45,309
really trying to stabilize the purple

466
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:47,920
trait in that strain is what I'm trying

467
00:15:45,309 --> 00:15:50,859
to do so I really want right now I'm

468
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:53,829
getting about a little more than 50% a

469
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:56,500
purple when I run a pack of 50 I'll have

470
00:15:53,830 --> 00:16:00,160
25 purple plants I want to make it up to

471
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:01,600
closer I want to get like 75% purple

472
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:03,699
plants out of this and then by the time

473
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:06,009
I'm done I'd like to see that purple

474
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:08,620
plant come out almost every time is what

475
00:16:06,009 --> 00:16:10,090
I'm aiming for I plan to take it to f5

476
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:12,940
over the next few years

477
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:14,200
I'll breed the f2 s this summer one

478
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:15,910
thing I've seen out of it that's really

479
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:18,400
cool is some of the phenotypes look done

480
00:16:15,909 --> 00:16:21,759
and there are only 55 days into flower

481
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:24,309
so I've made a purple strain with a Kim

482
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:26,950
flavor that finishes in about 55 to 65

483
00:16:24,309 --> 00:16:28,329
days which is pretty cool so that's my

484
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:30,310
black cherry chem project that's going

485
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:33,190
right now you can check out pictures of

486
00:16:30,309 --> 00:16:35,619
those I put them on Instagram and I also

487
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:37,630
put them on my forum on my website if

488
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:40,389
you go to I read genetics Colorado comm

00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:42,039
go to the forum it would be really cool

490
00:16:40,389 --> 00:16:43,240
if you join the forum sign up and join

491
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:44,679
the forum it doesn't cost anything

492
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,730
nothing weird is going to happen you're

493
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:47,829
just a member now and you can

494
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:50,230
communicate with us and participate but

495
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:51,970
every week I go and post a weekly grow

496
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:53,139
journal of my own gardens up there and

497
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:54,700
the black cherry Kim has been

498
00:16:53,139 --> 00:16:55,990
highlighted quite a bit so you can see a

499
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:58,420
lot of great pictures of black cherry

500
00:16:55,990 --> 00:17:00,430
cam on my website right now in the forum

501
00:16:58,419 --> 00:17:02,169
I'll go there and check it out if you

502
00:17:00,429 --> 00:17:04,419
can and all if you ask me questions

503
00:17:02,169 --> 00:17:06,039
there and you talk to me I really that's

504
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:07,539
my favorite place to go and communicate

505
00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:09,279
with people because they can't censor me

506
00:17:07,539 --> 00:17:11,019
because I own that Facebook can't shut

507
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:12,369
that down or anything so do what you

508
00:17:11,019 --> 00:17:13,480
want to do there if I think you're a

509
00:17:12,369 --> 00:17:15,309
dick I might tell you to quit being a

510
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:17,380
dick but then grow weed and post your

511
00:17:15,309 --> 00:17:20,619
weed pictures there I'd love it alright

512
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:24,610
um one thing I can talk about is I'm

513
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:26,199
looking for and a rise mail a rise is a

514
00:17:24,609 --> 00:17:28,359
golden goat that was pollinated by

515
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:31,330
Daybreaker and I really love that strain

516
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:34,329
it makes a great smell it makes a great

517
00:17:31,329 --> 00:17:36,429
flavor the high is amazing the plants

518
00:17:34,329 --> 00:17:39,159
put on super resin they grow in a good

519
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:40,690
amount of time ah they're real stout

520
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:42,100
plants you don't need a lot of staking

521
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:44,320
on it if you find the right phenotypes

522
00:17:42,099 --> 00:17:46,209
so I'm looking for a rise male I want to

523
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:47,409
use a rise in a long term breeding

524
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:50,529
project he will be my law

525
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:51,910
turn breeding mail um I see some

526
00:17:50,529 --> 00:17:54,339
beautiful things from the strain and I'm

527
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:56,080
sure that a good male will make some

528
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:57,369
more amazing crosses the resin

529
00:17:56,079 --> 00:17:59,619
production from that plant is so

530
00:17:57,369 --> 00:18:01,419
impressive but it'll be a few months

531
00:17:59,619 --> 00:18:03,819
before I select in a rise male I've got

532
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:05,860
the feminized golden goat lemon Jeffrey

533
00:18:03,819 --> 00:18:08,799
project ahead of that I've got the black

534
00:18:05,859 --> 00:18:11,849
cherry Kim ahead of that and then after

535
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:14,680
that will be the arise male selection um

536
00:18:11,849 --> 00:18:16,899
I want to find a good over eyes male for

537
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:19,600
my permanent breeding stud but I plan to

538
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:21,400
make like 15 to 20 f1 hybrids with their

539
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:23,740
eyes to see what works when I do find

540
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:25,440
that one um then I want to see what can

541
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:28,299
be improved on or what I need to abandon

542
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,220
um guys when you if you breed if you

543
00:18:28,299 --> 00:18:31,889
take a male plant and you hit six or

544
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:34,150
seven female plants with it

545
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:36,730
don't be afraid to throw away a bunch of

546
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:39,190
seeds when you you have to grow those so

547
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:41,079
you take male plant in a room with like

548
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:42,940
however many females you're gonna put in

549
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:44,740
there five six maybe twenty females

550
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:48,279
you're gonna make that many new crosses

551
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:49,990
you have to grow some of each batch of

552
00:18:48,279 --> 00:18:51,519
seeds yourself before you can do

553
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:52,720
anything else with them unless you give

554
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:54,430
me like your friend and you say these

555
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,440
are untested dude because you don't want

556
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:58,660
to put out seeds that you don't know

557
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:01,570
what they're gonna do so get the seeds

558
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:03,279
and grow at least ten I would say a

559
00:19:01,569 --> 00:19:05,259
hundred if you can I know you're limited

560
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:06,849
on space and things I like a Fino hunt

561
00:19:05,259 --> 00:19:09,759
of a hundred plants it really shows you

562
00:19:06,849 --> 00:19:12,189
the what's going to happen but grow some

563
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:14,470
of those and if they totally suck throw

564
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:16,210
them away I know that sounds crazy but

565
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:17,799
there are enough strains on the planet

566
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:19,769
to where if you just made some [ __ ]

567
00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:22,930
that doesn't improve the genetic line

568
00:19:19,769 --> 00:19:24,639
throw it away why do we need that don't

569
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:26,980
be so attached to your new creation that

570
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,390
oh it's a great strain it does this it

571
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:30,160
no it sucks

572
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:33,250
throw it away I've thrown away more

573
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:34,960
strains than I have kept um we all talk

574
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:36,339
about the lemon cush everybody had high

575
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:39,579
hopes threw the lemon cush that I worked

576
00:19:36,339 --> 00:19:41,949
with that strain sucked it tasted

577
00:19:39,579 --> 00:19:43,960
amazing and it grew big fat donkey dicks

578
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:45,850
four buds but you couldn't get high off

579
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:47,470
of it it would not make resin none of

580
00:19:45,849 --> 00:19:49,539
the phenotypes on that planet made resin

581
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:51,610
and I don't know why it's just that

582
00:19:49,539 --> 00:19:53,109
cross did not work so all of the seeds

583
00:19:51,609 --> 00:19:55,299
are gone all the clones are gone that

584
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:56,859
project has been abandoned I realized

585
00:19:55,299 --> 00:19:59,289
that's a failed project it wasted some

586
00:19:56,859 --> 00:20:00,909
time but I don't want to waste more time

587
00:19:59,289 --> 00:20:03,549
or more people's time with the same

588
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:06,960
project by sending out shitty seeds so

589
00:20:03,549 --> 00:20:08,680
um that's a rant on a not being too

590
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,759
attachment it's in a lesson an

591
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,110
attachment if you're too attached to

592
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:12,490
that strain then you're wasting your

593
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:13,419
time growing something that sucks and

594
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:14,349
you could have been grown something way

595
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:16,090
better you could have been breeding

596
00:20:14,349 --> 00:20:17,349
something that was way better just let

597
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:18,730
it go sometimes you gotta learn to let

598
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:20,349
things go remember that lesson I talked

599
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:21,670
about my rig that I dropped you just got

600
00:20:20,349 --> 00:20:24,609
to sweep it up and move on sometimes

601
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:27,490
alright so when I do get all these new

602
00:20:24,609 --> 00:20:29,859
strains made I will need help testing

603
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:31,870
these like I said I like to run a

604
00:20:29,859 --> 00:20:35,229
hundred myself but I will also send out

605
00:20:31,869 --> 00:20:36,789
a bunch of seeds to reliable testers the

606
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:38,440
way that I know you're reliable tester

607
00:20:36,789 --> 00:20:40,210
is you've joined my web forum and you

608
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:41,650
have posted pictures of your previous

609
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:43,569
grows on my forum and you stay in

610
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:45,430
contact with me and you show that you're

611
00:20:43,569 --> 00:20:47,500
serious about it that's a lot of how I

612
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:49,870
find my testers is off of my own website

613
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:51,700
so in the future if you're interested in

614
00:20:49,869 --> 00:20:54,069
testing IRA genetics seeds that would

615
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:56,170
help you a lot to join the forum I do

616
00:20:54,069 --> 00:20:59,259
play favorites that way it's my choice

617
00:20:56,170 --> 00:21:00,610
all right let's see I'm not sure what

618
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:03,970
else to say about IRA genetics

619
00:21:00,609 --> 00:21:05,559
I'm the head breeder I make 99% of the

620
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:07,420
decisions with help from my friends I do

621
00:21:05,559 --> 00:21:09,129
let the people around me kind of give

622
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:10,690
their input because their cannabis

623
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:13,030
consumers growers smokers they have a

624
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:15,850
lot to say but that's me IRA genetics is

625
00:21:13,029 --> 00:21:16,930
all Rasta Jeff I have trim friends that

626
00:21:15,849 --> 00:21:18,639
help me shoutout to everybody that's

627
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:20,380
ever came and helped me trim some IRA

628
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,670
genetic stuff or shoutout to all the

629
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:25,360
people that have helped me package seeds

630
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:27,070
or whatever so in the future I am going

631
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:28,629
to get away from the feminized seed

632
00:21:27,069 --> 00:21:31,450
market as much because feminized seeds

633
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:34,000
are a pain in the ass to make and I

634
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:35,590
think that we should all eventually step

635
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,809
up our game and learn to just grow

636
00:21:35,589 --> 00:21:39,519
regular seeds if we didn't have male

637
00:21:37,809 --> 00:21:43,299
plants we wouldn't have more plants

638
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:45,490
anyway so it's my responsibility to put

639
00:21:43,299 --> 00:21:49,720
out more regular seeds I think than I do

640
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:50,980
feminized seeds and I see um I see

641
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,930
better [ __ ] come from the regular

642
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:54,880
crosses than I do the FEM seeds honestly

643
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:56,890
feminized seeds are stuck you can't

644
00:21:54,880 --> 00:22:00,010
improve on them too much the cross that

645
00:21:56,890 --> 00:22:01,870
you make that's what you got like I see

646
00:22:00,009 --> 00:22:04,089
when I cross like if it's feminized if I

647
00:22:01,869 --> 00:22:05,559
cross plant a and plant B they come out

648
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:07,720
a little bit better than a and B were

649
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:10,119
but you can't make them super better if

650
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:12,909
I take a regular male plant and a female

651
00:22:10,119 --> 00:22:14,228
plant and cross that I see much

652
00:22:12,909 --> 00:22:16,629
her stuff come out of that much more

653
00:22:14,229 --> 00:22:19,840
improved plants transgressive

654
00:22:16,628 --> 00:22:22,388
segregation my offspring will outperform

655
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:24,069
each parent and that only happens when

656
00:22:22,388 --> 00:22:26,439
I'm using regular pollen I can't make

657
00:22:24,069 --> 00:22:29,098
that happen with my feminized pollen so

658
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:31,119
there are a couple reasons why I will

659
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:33,189
eventually abandon the feminized seeds

660
00:22:31,118 --> 00:22:35,138
that's eventually I'm not saying soon

661
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:37,899
but one of these days I will stop making

662
00:22:35,138 --> 00:22:39,758
FEM seeds I don't know what else to say

663
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:40,959
about IRA genetics that's a there's so

664
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:42,608
much I could say but I feel like I'm

665
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:45,220
just stroking my own ego over here

666
00:22:42,608 --> 00:22:48,368
talking about I real ah um support IRA

667
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:50,079
genetic student it's a Rastafarian seed

668
00:22:48,368 --> 00:22:52,329
company by her Asda man so instead of

669
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:54,009
having mass-produced commercial seeds

670
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:56,769
you've got seeds every seed was touched

671
00:22:54,009 --> 00:22:58,839
by me every plant was touched by me by

672
00:22:56,769 --> 00:23:00,098
my Rastafarian hands so it's got a

673
00:22:58,839 --> 00:23:01,749
little bit of Rasta love in there I

674
00:23:00,098 --> 00:23:03,700
think that means something to me I'd

675
00:23:01,749 --> 00:23:06,700
rather buy products from a small company

676
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:08,348
that cares about their products than the

677
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:11,048
Walmart of whatever industry you're in

678
00:23:08,348 --> 00:23:12,848
alright let's get on to another topic

679
00:23:11,048 --> 00:23:15,908
here I mentioned that I want to talk

680
00:23:12,848 --> 00:23:17,229
about feminized seeds a little bit um a

681
00:23:15,909 --> 00:23:19,299
lot of people seem to have

682
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:21,308
misconceptions on what feminized seeds

683
00:23:19,298 --> 00:23:23,220
are on how they're made on where they

684
00:23:21,308 --> 00:23:25,298
come from and on what they will do um

685
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:27,700
people think that feminized seeds are

686
00:23:25,298 --> 00:23:30,190
straight-up hermaphrodite seeds which

687
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:31,869
I've got a pretty popular seed company

688
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:34,058
that only sold feminized seeds for two

689
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:35,618
years and we came up pretty good and I

690
00:23:34,058 --> 00:23:37,960
don't know how I read genetics would be

691
00:23:35,618 --> 00:23:40,388
popular and/or reliable if we just sold

692
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:41,528
a bunch of damn perms so let's start

693
00:23:40,388 --> 00:23:43,478
with some basics here what does it mean

694
00:23:41,528 --> 00:23:46,239
to have feminized seeds I took a few

695
00:23:43,479 --> 00:23:48,098
random notes feminized seeds mean that

696
00:23:46,239 --> 00:23:50,499
the seeds will produce all female plants

697
00:23:48,098 --> 00:23:52,418
I can only say 99% female plants because

698
00:23:50,499 --> 00:23:56,319
this is science and nature and [ __ ]

699
00:23:52,419 --> 00:23:57,879
happens but they'll be 99% females this

700
00:23:56,319 --> 00:23:59,589
is helpful because new growers don't

701
00:23:57,878 --> 00:24:02,199
know how to identify male plants in

702
00:23:59,589 --> 00:24:03,339
their gardens so if you're growing

703
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,139
feminized seeds you don't have to watch

704
00:24:03,339 --> 00:24:07,269
for the boys it also makes things easier

705
00:24:05,138 --> 00:24:09,548
for growers with limited space because

706
00:24:07,269 --> 00:24:11,229
the grower knows that every seed planted

707
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:13,658
will be a usable female and none of

708
00:24:11,229 --> 00:24:15,069
their space soil nutrients water

709
00:24:13,659 --> 00:24:17,139
electricity none of that's going to be

710
00:24:15,069 --> 00:24:18,548
wasted on growing a male plant that had

711
00:24:17,138 --> 00:24:21,428
to be chopped down 10 days into flower

712
00:24:18,548 --> 00:24:23,440
so feminized seeds mean that all the

713
00:24:21,429 --> 00:24:26,350
seeds will produce female plants now

714
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:28,990
here is where some people are confused

715
00:24:26,349 --> 00:24:31,178
or feminized seeds made pay close

716
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:33,460
attention because honestly you guys I am

717
00:24:31,179 --> 00:24:34,750
I'm amazed with myself that I'm giving

718
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:35,860
out this information is one of my

719
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:38,829
biggest secrets and I don't usually

720
00:24:35,859 --> 00:24:40,928
share with anyone um I want to take a

721
00:24:38,829 --> 00:24:42,009
DAB in a drink before I share this but

722
00:24:40,929 --> 00:24:43,840
I'm gonna take a quick dab in a quick

723
00:24:42,009 --> 00:24:47,288
drink and then I will teach you guys how

724
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:50,769
I make reliable feminised seeds on a

725
00:24:47,288 --> 00:24:53,079
semi large scale for nature's green

726
00:24:50,769 --> 00:24:54,308
remedies and patience throughout

727
00:24:53,079 --> 00:24:56,109
Colorado give me a quick second I'm

728
00:24:54,308 --> 00:24:57,940
gonna take a DAB in a drink all right

729
00:24:56,109 --> 00:25:00,099
guys I am back and heavily medicated

730
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:02,470
after that dab I want to tell you how I

731
00:25:00,099 --> 00:25:04,719
make my feminized seeds first of all I

732
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:06,460
got to warn you that the chemicals that

733
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,900
I will describe here are a little bit

734
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:09,759
dangerous and you need to follow the

735
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:11,559
safety rules for these I am NOT

736
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:12,730
responsible for you hurting yourself or

737
00:25:11,558 --> 00:25:14,889
making yourself sick with these

738
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:17,140
chemicals okay I'm simply telling you

739
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:18,640
how I do this if you do this follow the

740
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:21,520
instructions wear gloves

741
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:23,409
wear goggles do everything safely so the

742
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:26,440
way I start is I order silver nitrate

743
00:25:23,409 --> 00:25:30,460
and sodium thiosulfate from a scientific

744
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:33,429
supply company um I get powdered

745
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:36,548
versions of silver nitrate and sodium

746
00:25:33,429 --> 00:25:38,730
thiosulfate and I mix I'm not even gonna

747
00:25:36,548 --> 00:25:42,579
tell you the delusions or the rates but

748
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:44,798
I mix the silver nitrate into an amount

749
00:25:42,579 --> 00:25:46,869
of water and I mix an amount of the

750
00:25:44,798 --> 00:25:49,329
thiosulfate into an amount of water and

751
00:25:46,869 --> 00:25:52,599
then I mix those two in another

752
00:25:49,329 --> 00:25:54,908
container into another container and now

753
00:25:52,599 --> 00:25:57,369
I've got 100 percent silver thiosulfate

754
00:25:54,909 --> 00:26:00,450
in that third container and I will

755
00:25:57,369 --> 00:26:03,369
dilute that to a certain dilution now

756
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:05,230
some plants will take will need stronger

757
00:26:03,369 --> 00:26:08,109
delusions of the silver thiosulfate and

758
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:09,849
some plants will need lighter delusions

759
00:26:08,109 --> 00:26:15,189
of the silver thiosulfate what I've

760
00:26:09,849 --> 00:26:16,928
learned as some plants I can treat some

761
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:19,509
plants one time with the silver

762
00:26:16,929 --> 00:26:21,340
thiosulfate at a high dilution just

763
00:26:19,509 --> 00:26:23,470
before flout the day before flower and

764
00:26:21,339 --> 00:26:25,359
that will work for that plant some of

765
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:27,788
them I have to make the dilution much

766
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:29,859
weaker and spray it multiple times and

767
00:26:27,788 --> 00:26:32,349
some plants I have to make it stronger

768
00:26:29,859 --> 00:26:34,109
and only spray at once and the only way

769
00:26:32,349 --> 00:26:36,250
you'll learn this is through

770
00:26:34,109 --> 00:26:38,829
experimentation by trying plants by

771
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:40,929
trying different delusions so

772
00:26:38,829 --> 00:26:42,038
I put the silver nitrate into one

773
00:26:40,929 --> 00:26:43,960
container of water and put the

774
00:26:42,038 --> 00:26:45,519
thiosulfate into another container of

775
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:47,558
water I shake them up to where it

776
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:49,149
dissolves I mix equal amounts into

777
00:26:47,558 --> 00:26:51,190
another container and then I take that

778
00:26:49,148 --> 00:26:52,509
container and dilute it to the proper

779
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:53,048
dilution for the plant that I'm working

780
00:26:52,509 --> 00:26:56,079
with

781
00:26:53,048 --> 00:26:57,609
then I will I'm going to use golden goat

782
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:59,648
because I'm I just did this to golden

783
00:26:57,609 --> 00:27:01,000
goat about seven days ago I took three

784
00:26:59,648 --> 00:27:02,798
golden goat plants and I put them in a

785
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,839
small space where there aren't any other

786
00:27:02,798 --> 00:27:08,349
plants around there's no wind to where

787
00:27:04,839 --> 00:27:09,609
my spray is not going to randomly land

788
00:27:08,349 --> 00:27:11,109
on other plants because I don't want to

789
00:27:09,609 --> 00:27:13,689
reverse other plants on accident in this

790
00:27:11,109 --> 00:27:15,038
process so I took my three golden goat

791
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:18,159
plants I put them in a small confined

792
00:27:15,038 --> 00:27:20,619
space and I sprayed them with my silver

793
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:23,620
thiosulfate mix at the proper dilution

794
00:27:20,619 --> 00:27:25,329
and I sprayed these plants to the point

795
00:27:23,619 --> 00:27:27,219
where they are dripping from top to

796
00:27:25,329 --> 00:27:29,949
bottom these plants were covered in the

797
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:30,940
silver thiosulfate solution be careful

798
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:33,490
because if you use the silver

799
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:35,798
thiosulfate at a strong dilution it may

800
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:37,569
turn things purple like the floor where

801
00:27:35,798 --> 00:27:38,918
the spray lands on the wall behind it it

802
00:27:37,569 --> 00:27:40,869
may turn it may leave little purple

803
00:27:38,919 --> 00:27:42,299
marks so be careful or a little shiny

804
00:27:40,869 --> 00:27:44,379
purple mark like shiny

805
00:27:42,298 --> 00:27:45,638
iridescent looking marks I think is the

806
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:46,809
word it's gonna need the way it looks

807
00:27:45,638 --> 00:27:48,759
but it'll screw some stuff up if you

808
00:27:46,808 --> 00:27:51,940
don't want your things purple be careful

809
00:27:48,759 --> 00:27:53,710
so spray the plants then I let them sit

810
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:55,240
and dry because I want them dry before

811
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:58,090
they go in a flower room so I let the

812
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:59,500
plants dry then I carry those plants to

813
00:27:58,089 --> 00:28:02,199
the flower room where they will go into

814
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:04,778
flower and I try to spray them right

815
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:06,700
before the lights off for the flowering

816
00:28:04,778 --> 00:28:07,929
cycle so they get sprayed they dry and

817
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:09,278
then they go into the flower room and

818
00:28:07,929 --> 00:28:11,830
the lights go off and they have now just

819
00:28:09,278 --> 00:28:15,339
gone into flower and with the golden

820
00:28:11,829 --> 00:28:18,250
goat I can spray it one time on the day

821
00:28:15,339 --> 00:28:22,048
of flower and in about ten days that

822
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:25,288
plant will show me male flowers no

823
00:28:22,048 --> 00:28:27,250
people are saying how does that work I

824
00:28:25,288 --> 00:28:29,470
gotta explain this to you kind of slowly

825
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:30,759
so pay attention because I'm trying to

826
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:32,169
explain it to myself I don't have any

827
00:28:30,759 --> 00:28:34,690
notes on this im just freestylin right

828
00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:37,299
now so bear with me what happens is when

829
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:40,298
we spray a female plant with silver

830
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:42,730
thiosulfate solution the thiosulfate

831
00:28:40,298 --> 00:28:44,319
acts as a carrier for the silver the

832
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:47,230
silver isn't really absorbed by the

833
00:28:44,319 --> 00:28:49,148
leaves easily but the thiosulfate makes

834
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:50,860
it get in there a little bit better so

835
00:28:49,148 --> 00:28:52,089
we're tricking the plants into taking

836
00:28:50,859 --> 00:28:54,278
the silver by a

837
00:28:52,089 --> 00:28:57,399
the thiosulfate now when the silver

838
00:28:54,278 --> 00:28:59,259
reaches the plants the silver disrupts

839
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:01,538
the copper movement in the plant system

840
00:28:59,259 --> 00:29:04,269
there is copper in your plants yes the

841
00:29:01,538 --> 00:29:06,308
silver will disrupt that when that

842
00:29:04,269 --> 00:29:08,349
copper movement is disrupted in the

843
00:29:06,308 --> 00:29:10,808
plant system it responds by triggering

844
00:29:08,349 --> 00:29:12,069
an ethylene production or I'm sorry an

845
00:29:10,808 --> 00:29:13,509
ethylene it triggers an ethylene

846
00:29:12,069 --> 00:29:15,009
response it's not an ethylene production

847
00:29:13,509 --> 00:29:18,640
it's an ethylene response and that

848
00:29:15,009 --> 00:29:20,349
ethylene response tells the plant that

849
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,360
something is seriously wrong and it's

850
00:29:20,349 --> 00:29:24,639
time to go into survival mode so that

851
00:29:22,359 --> 00:29:27,278
plant survival method is to create male

852
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:29,169
flowers that will create pollen because

853
00:29:27,278 --> 00:29:31,538
now all that plant wants to do is shoot

854
00:29:29,169 --> 00:29:32,049
pollen and reproduce to keep the species

855
00:29:31,538 --> 00:29:34,390
alive

856
00:29:32,048 --> 00:29:35,109
so I've disrupted the copper the plants

857
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:37,899
freaking out

858
00:29:35,109 --> 00:29:39,069
it panics the panic causes ethylene to

859
00:29:37,898 --> 00:29:41,589
move through the plant in a weird way

860
00:29:39,069 --> 00:29:43,808
that ethylene triggers the plant to

861
00:29:41,589 --> 00:29:46,839
throw out flowers that are male flowers

862
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:49,690
that produce pollen now since those

863
00:29:46,839 --> 00:29:51,639
plants that female plant is all female

864
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:53,440
it does not have any male chromosomes

865
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:55,120
the only reason it is showing male sex

866
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:58,720
parts is because I've stressed it and

867
00:29:55,119 --> 00:30:00,519
manipulated it so it will now throw out

868
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:03,269
male parts that contain pollen and

869
00:30:00,519 --> 00:30:05,859
though that pollen will be all female

870
00:30:03,269 --> 00:30:06,879
excuse me my throat's clogging up here

871
00:30:05,859 --> 00:30:11,109
from the dabs let me take another drink

872
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:12,940
of water alright that should help so now

873
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:14,619
we've got female plants that are

874
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:16,509
spitting out all female pollen and we're

875
00:30:14,619 --> 00:30:18,969
taking that pollen and of course putting

876
00:30:16,509 --> 00:30:22,269
it on female plants you know we've never

877
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:25,089
introduced any male pollen here so like

878
00:30:22,269 --> 00:30:26,679
I said before 99% of those plants should

879
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:28,720
come out female and the only reason I

880
00:30:26,679 --> 00:30:30,669
can say 99% is because like I said it's

881
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:33,220
science and nature and [ __ ] does happen

882
00:30:30,669 --> 00:30:35,110
and also your grow room can cause issues

883
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:36,839
as well your gross style can I'm not

884
00:30:35,109 --> 00:30:38,918
blaming it on you I'm just saying that

885
00:30:36,839 --> 00:30:41,079
environmental factors and all that stuff

886
00:30:38,919 --> 00:30:44,080
plus science and nature will lead to

887
00:30:41,079 --> 00:30:45,519
some screw-ups and I'll take credit for

888
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:47,230
part of those screw-ups because I'm the

889
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:49,898
one that made the seeds but when this is

890
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:53,528
done right we get quality reliable

891
00:30:49,898 --> 00:30:55,148
feminized seeds so I hope that makes a

892
00:30:53,528 --> 00:30:56,679
little bit of sense um

893
00:30:55,148 --> 00:30:59,500
I make the psilocybin sulfate and I

894
00:30:56,679 --> 00:31:01,919
spray the plants with it and magically

895
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:03,849
that makes the plants turn into

896
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:04,640
transsexuals they're not male plants

897
00:31:03,849 --> 00:31:06,139
they're

898
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:09,230
reversed females is what we call them

899
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:10,970
and that basically is how I am making

900
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:12,440
feminized seeds so these are not

901
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:14,000
hermaphrodite seeds I'm not taking

902
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:15,980
hermaphroditic plants and using

903
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,809
hermaphrodite pollen I'm not doing

904
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:20,240
anything crazy ridiculous this is

905
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:22,190
reliable science um the reason a lot of

906
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,960
people are afraid of feminized seeds is

907
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:27,470
because when it was started there were

908
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:30,170
other um less reliable practices used to

909
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:31,460
make phem seeds um soma does another

910
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:33,830
method since we talked about soma

911
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:36,170
earlier in the show soma does not use

912
00:31:33,829 --> 00:31:36,740
the silver thiosulfate method as often

913
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:39,170
as I do

914
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:41,599
what soma does is he lets his plants

915
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:43,039
grow too long so if he's got a 10-week

916
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:45,349
flowering plant he'll let it grow about

917
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:47,539
12 weeks and when a plant goes that long

918
00:31:45,349 --> 00:31:49,429
it kind of stresses itself and then it

919
00:31:47,539 --> 00:31:51,619
hums out and creates pollen that way and

920
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:54,950
that's what soma is using I've also

921
00:31:51,619 --> 00:31:56,509
heard of soma taking a mature plant and

922
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:57,650
this sounds completely crazy to a lot of

923
00:31:56,509 --> 00:31:59,930
growers but it'll make sense

924
00:31:57,650 --> 00:32:02,060
he takes a completely mature plant and

925
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:04,190
then he will light a small fire and he

926
00:32:02,059 --> 00:32:06,859
will put his plant too close to the fire

927
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:08,420
the plant panics and the plant feels

928
00:32:06,859 --> 00:32:10,539
like it's a forest fire coming so that

929
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:12,950
plant starts to create male flowers and

930
00:32:10,539 --> 00:32:16,119
it's a female plant it's freaking out

931
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:18,680
it's triggering that survival instinct

932
00:32:16,119 --> 00:32:20,359
so it makes those male flowers which

933
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:22,009
make pollen and then soma collects that

934
00:32:20,359 --> 00:32:24,709
pollen and sprinkles it on to other

935
00:32:22,009 --> 00:32:26,480
plants and maybe this explains why

936
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:28,490
feminized seeds are so damn expensive

937
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:30,559
because there are more steps into making

938
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:33,200
feminized seeds there are to making

939
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:35,269
regular true breeding male female seeds

940
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:37,309
that's why it's hard for me to keep up

941
00:32:35,269 --> 00:32:38,900
because I have to reverse plants and I

942
00:32:37,309 --> 00:32:40,519
don't get as much pollen from reversing

943
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:42,800
these plants as I do from a normal male

944
00:32:40,519 --> 00:32:45,619
and it takes a little longer

945
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:47,839
alright I feel like I told you enough

946
00:32:45,619 --> 00:32:49,000
about reversing plants I think you

947
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:51,049
should have caught on by now like I said

948
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:54,049
you're gonna have to experiment with the

949
00:32:51,049 --> 00:32:56,029
delusions and the application rates um

950
00:32:54,049 --> 00:32:58,129
in n Rosenthal's book I don't have it

951
00:32:56,029 --> 00:32:59,899
next me the Oaksterdam course guide they

952
00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:01,550
had wrote the most like not even sure

953
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:03,320
that it's the most current but ed

954
00:33:01,549 --> 00:33:05,419
Rosenthal wrote an Oaksterdam course

955
00:33:03,319 --> 00:33:08,839
guide and in that book there is a recipe

956
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:10,610
to make your own silver thiosulfate that

957
00:33:08,839 --> 00:33:12,259
recipe does work although for some

958
00:33:10,609 --> 00:33:15,679
plants it will need some adjusting

959
00:33:12,259 --> 00:33:17,750
that's just my advice alright I am going

960
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:18,529
to take a phat dab and take a drink and

961
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:19,849
try to get this frog

962
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:21,829
my throat so that I can sound like an

963
00:33:19,849 --> 00:33:23,089
actual podcaster I'll give me one second

964
00:33:21,829 --> 00:33:24,519
I'll be right back guys and we will give

965
00:33:23,089 --> 00:33:26,959
some shoutouts and wrap up the show

966
00:33:24,519 --> 00:33:28,039
alright guys I'm back I apologize for

967
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,200
taking so many breaks on you this

968
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:31,759
episode usually I have some guests that

969
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:33,470
can cover me while in coffin and taking

970
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:34,670
a drink or whatever but today was just

971
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:36,680
me so you had to bear with me I

972
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:38,810
apologize I hope you enjoy the show

973
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:39,710
I just took a big old fat dab of some

974
00:33:38,809 --> 00:33:42,589
Jack the Ripper

975
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:46,009
shatter made by my good friends at Terp

993
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:21,230

995

quite a few tiers of pricing I don't

996

want to get you pumped up because

997
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:28,550
