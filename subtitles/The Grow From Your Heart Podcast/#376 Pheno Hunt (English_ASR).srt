garden I highly recommend the hell a

7
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:24,960
dank seed company and you can find them

8
00:00:14,218 --> 00:00:27,778
at www.sedar.com I let acade AB of some

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,480
strawberry diesel batter from apothecary

10
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:33,558
farms the label says it is 60 1.9

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,058
percent THC with a total of 73.7%

12
00:00:33,558 --> 00:00:38,369
cannabinoids this stuff has a really

13
00:00:36,058 --> 00:00:39,959
funky sort of a sour strawberry smell to

14
00:00:38,369 --> 00:00:41,519
it it's definitely got the strawberries

15
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,179
with a hint of diesel coming through the

16
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,609
background

17
00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:46,469
it tasted like strawberry incense and I

18
00:00:44,609 --> 00:00:47,909
really like the flavor the flavor is

19
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:49,289
just hanging out on my tongue I could

20
00:00:47,909 --> 00:00:51,448
use a drink but I don't want to drink

21
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:52,710
anything to wipe that strawberry flavor

22
00:00:51,448 --> 00:00:54,628
off of my tongue I want to let that

23
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:56,549
linger as long as it can so I'm really

24
00:00:54,628 --> 00:00:58,229
diggin the flavor and the high is nice

25
00:00:56,549 --> 00:01:00,390
it goes straight to the brain it's a

26
00:00:58,229 --> 00:01:02,308
nice high-energy sort of a buzz I really

27
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:05,308
like the strawberry diesel batter from

28
00:01:02,308 --> 00:01:06,959
apothecary farms alright let's get right

29
00:01:05,308 --> 00:01:08,879
into the podcast you guys this is going

30
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:10,289
to be another grow lesson if you've been

31
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:12,629
following along you know I've been doing

32
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:14,400
a long series of grow lessons this

33
00:01:12,629 --> 00:01:16,798
episode is going to be about Fino

34
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,299
hunting so far in my series of grow

35
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,250
lessons we have talked about setting a

36
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:21,990
goal for our grow we have chosen a wise

37
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:23,849
spot for the grow we have selected and

38
00:01:21,989 --> 00:01:25,649
purchased the proper equipment we have

39
00:01:23,849 --> 00:01:27,329
set it up we've tested it we have

40
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:29,130
actually sprouted seeds we've acquired

41
00:01:27,329 --> 00:01:30,989
clones we've got little baby plants

42
00:01:29,129 --> 00:01:33,060
going we potted those into our three or

43
00:01:30,989 --> 00:01:34,920
five maybe seven gallon pots we are

44
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,900
currently in the veg phase in my grow

45
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,280
lessons we have topped our plants we've

46
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,630
been doing lolli popping we've been

47
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,430
doing popping and twisting we've got

48
00:01:39,629 --> 00:01:44,039
some canopy control techniques happening

49
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:46,229
we are almost ready to flower in my grow

50
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,939
lessons before we get to the flowering

51
00:01:46,228 --> 00:01:50,159
phase I feel like there are a few things

52
00:01:47,938 --> 00:01:52,349
we should understand we need to know how

53
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,060
to sex our plants if you are growing

54
00:01:52,349 --> 00:01:56,218
from seed you've got the opportunity to

55
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,140
find males those plants won't reveal

56
00:01:56,218 --> 00:02:00,209
their sex until we are early and flower

57
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,920
we need to be able to identify the male

58
00:02:00,209 --> 00:02:03,658
plants so that we can remove them from

59
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,700
the garden before they pollinate our

60
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:07,500
females another thing we're going to

61
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,729
talk about is selecting mother plants

62
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,669
and we're going to do that through a

63
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:13,260
Fino hunt let's jump right in to talking

64
00:02:11,669 --> 00:02:15,479
about a Fino hunt and what

65
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:18,239
fino hunt is and what is the purpose of

66
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:21,179
Fino hunting now what do I mean by a

67
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:24,120
Fino hunt when I say a Fino hunt I am

68
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:26,939
referring to finding a desired phenotype

69
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:29,250
from a package of seeds now let's say

70
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:31,049
you acquired a package of seeds from the

71
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:33,419
hella dank seed company I would

72
00:02:31,049 --> 00:02:35,579
recommend ten seeds for a Fino hunt I do

73
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:36,988
sell packs of five I sell packs of five

74
00:02:35,579 --> 00:02:38,819
to make them attainable so that

75
00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:40,289
everybody can afford them I understand

76
00:02:38,818 --> 00:02:42,628
not everybody can buy a ten pack of

77
00:02:40,289 --> 00:02:44,669
seeds I would recommend ten seeds for a

78
00:02:42,628 --> 00:02:46,408
fee no hunt so in this situation we're

79
00:02:44,669 --> 00:02:48,689
going to run ten seeds you just got a

80
00:02:46,408 --> 00:02:50,669
fresh ten pack of a rise you don't know

81
00:02:48,689 --> 00:02:53,219
what's in there we need to find that

82
00:02:50,669 --> 00:02:55,589
phenotype that works best for you and

83
00:02:53,219 --> 00:02:58,049
your garden so sifting through those

84
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:59,579
seeds is a Fino hunt we're going to grow

85
00:02:58,049 --> 00:03:02,069
them out and you were going to find the

86
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:03,359
phenotype that works best for you the

87
00:03:02,068 --> 00:03:05,369
phenotype that works best for your

88
00:03:03,359 --> 00:03:06,900
patients or your customers and also you

89
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:09,150
need the phenotype that works best for

90
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:11,849
your garden so the goal here is to find

91
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:13,560
a custom-tailored phenotype out of this

92
00:03:11,848 --> 00:03:15,000
pack of seeds so let's talk about a

93
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,340
little bit how to do that

94
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,620
doing a Fino hunt is one of my favorite

95
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:21,598
things to do in a grow environment I get

96
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:23,909
to do a lot of observation I get to find

97
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:26,339
surprises I may find the next best thing

98
00:03:23,909 --> 00:03:28,109
I may find that next chem dog I may find

99
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:30,329
the next golden coat I may find the next

100
00:03:28,109 --> 00:03:32,430
Gorilla Glue I may find the next Girl

101
00:03:30,329 --> 00:03:34,199
Scout cookies you never know what you

102
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:36,090
could come up with in a Fino hunt that

103
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:37,650
is one of my favorite parts it's like

104
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:39,509
opening Christmas presents you never

105
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:41,549
know what is in that box

106
00:03:39,509 --> 00:03:43,378
suddenly I want to make a Forrest Gump

107
00:03:41,549 --> 00:03:45,480
reference because you never know what

108
00:03:43,378 --> 00:03:47,578
you're gonna get so this is how I would

109
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:48,090
do a Fino hunt I would get a ten pack of

110
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:50,340
seeds

111
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:53,128
I would germinate those ten seeds I

112
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:55,378
would carefully make sure that every one

113
00:03:53,128 --> 00:03:57,000
of those plants is treated the exact

114
00:03:55,378 --> 00:03:59,280
same I would put them all in the same

115
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,719
medium the same pot I would feed them

116
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,549
the same thing they would go under the

117
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:04,560
same light and they would be all in the

118
00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:06,810
same environment because I don't want

119
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,729
any variation I want all of these

120
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:10,859
seedlings to get the same opportunity to

121
00:04:08,729 --> 00:04:13,018
show me the same potential so I

122
00:04:10,859 --> 00:04:16,228
germinate these seeds I get them into

123
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:18,329
pots I get them going edge them I start

124
00:04:16,228 --> 00:04:20,879
taking notes on these plants very early

125
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:22,139
I label them one through ten so I've got

126
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:24,569
whatever the strain is we're gonna say

127
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:26,490
arise one arise two all the way up to

128
00:04:24,569 --> 00:04:26,939
number ten I'm going to pay attention to

129
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:29,310
these

130
00:04:26,939 --> 00:04:30,839
and take a lot of notes if I see

131
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:32,879
anything weird I'm going to document

132
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:34,709
that if I get a plant that's just

133
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:36,509
growing like [ __ ] it's not keeping up

134
00:04:34,709 --> 00:04:38,549
it's having problems it gets pulled out

135
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:40,529
of there I don't want to keep a shitty

136
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:42,120
plant around there's no reason to have a

137
00:04:40,529 --> 00:04:44,399
shitty plant when you can Fino hunt

138
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,780
seeds and find a keeper so I'll pay

139
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:47,939
close attention to my plants as they

140
00:04:45,779 --> 00:04:50,250
grow I'll take a lot of notes in veg if

141
00:04:47,939 --> 00:04:52,319
I top the plants if I lollipop the

142
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:54,569
plants I make sure to do it equally

143
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:56,069
across the board I want all 10 of these

144
00:04:54,569 --> 00:04:58,259
seedlings to get the same treatment

145
00:04:56,069 --> 00:05:00,240
again we want them all to have the same

146
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:02,339
potential we were trying to audition

147
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,290
these to find the best one for our

148
00:05:02,339 --> 00:05:05,669
situation so if you give them different

149
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:07,319
treatment they're going to come out

150
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:09,629
differently how do you know what the

151
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:12,360
best one is they all need to be treated

152
00:05:09,629 --> 00:05:14,129
equally in my opinion so I grow these

153
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,830
plants out as soon as they're big enough

154
00:05:14,129 --> 00:05:20,250
I take a clone I am confident in my

155
00:05:16,829 --> 00:05:22,319
cloning skills 99.9% of my clones will

156
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:24,689
survive if you were not confident in

157
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:27,209
your clone skills I suggest you take two

158
00:05:24,689 --> 00:05:29,129
maybe three maybe five clones from each

159
00:05:27,209 --> 00:05:30,810
plant so let them get large enough to

160
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:33,689
provide the amount of clones you need

161
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:35,579
get a clone from each plant carefully

162
00:05:33,689 --> 00:05:38,069
label your clones you will have a rise

163
00:05:35,579 --> 00:05:41,539
number one a rise number two you should

164
00:05:38,069 --> 00:05:43,620
have clone a rise one clone a rise to

165
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:45,660
carefully label them this will be very

166
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:47,970
important in the future this is your

167
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:50,189
reserve this is how you are going to

168
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:52,200
keep your plants around this is going to

169
00:05:50,189 --> 00:05:53,310
segue into selecting a mother plant this

170
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:55,199
is how we're going to have a mother

171
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:56,910
plant to keep these genetics around

172
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,519
forever so you can continue to produce

173
00:05:56,910 --> 00:06:01,890
this select phenotype until the end of

174
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:03,930
time that clone that we labeled is going

175
00:06:01,889 --> 00:06:06,149
to become your future mother plants so

176
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:08,400
make sure it is labeled accurately so

177
00:06:06,149 --> 00:06:10,469
again we label them a rise 1 a rise to

178
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:13,589
all the way up to a rise number 10 then

179
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:15,300
we also label the clones a 1 a 2 a all

180
00:06:13,589 --> 00:06:16,859
the way up to number 10 so we've got the

181
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,329
cloned owner and the corresponding

182
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:20,280
clones properly labeled there's no

183
00:06:18,329 --> 00:06:22,500
confusion there you guys have done a

184
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:23,699
complete episode on cutting clones so if

185
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:27,060
you need help cutting your clones

186
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:29,490
I recommend episode number 346 for an

187
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:31,168
in-depth lesson on cutting clones and if

188
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:33,990
you want a really in-depth talk about

189
00:06:31,168 --> 00:06:35,759
mother plants check out episode 315 that

190
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:38,340
one will teach you all about healthy and

191
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,990
happy mother plants the goal here is to

192
00:06:38,339 --> 00:06:40,829
get a clone off of each of these

193
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:43,079
seedling

194
00:06:40,829 --> 00:06:45,449
before we put them into flour that way

195
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:47,639
when we find the champion out of this

196
00:06:45,449 --> 00:06:49,199
batch we've got a clone of that so that

197
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:51,629
we can continue to grow that clone

198
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,550
forever you keep that one clone a wife

199
00:06:51,629 --> 00:06:55,649
as a mother plant you never flour it out

200
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:57,270
and you can cut clones from that as long

201
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:58,979
as you keep it healthy so it's always

202
00:06:57,269 --> 00:07:01,469
there to give you clones you have now

203
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:04,050
got a mother plant from your Fino hunt

204
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:06,990
that is your custom phenotype that is

205
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:08,759
for you maybe you like the more sativa

206
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:10,949
dominant phenotype maybe you like the

207
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:12,360
phenotype that smells more like golden

208
00:07:10,949 --> 00:07:14,550
goat maybe you like the phenotype that

209
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:16,230
smells more like dirty feet maybe you

210
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:17,730
need the one that finishes quicker maybe

211
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:19,860
you're the kind of person that likes to

212
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:22,020
let them flower for a really long time

213
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:24,750
that's up to you you get to find that

214
00:07:22,019 --> 00:07:26,789
one it works best for you in your grow

215
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:28,310
if you get a clone you've got a clone

216
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:30,360
that all of your other friends have

217
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:32,040
everybody's grown it everybody in the

218
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,870
neighborhood has it everybody has smoked

219
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:35,910
it there's nothing setting you apart

220
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:38,639
from the competition if you were growing

221
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:40,890
for a retail market purpose so growing

222
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:43,019
from seed you could find gold growing

223
00:07:40,889 --> 00:07:45,000
from seed you can also find that custom

224
00:07:43,019 --> 00:07:46,919
phenotype that works for you that works

225
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,899
for your garden and that works for the

226
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:51,240
market and honestly when you're growing

227
00:07:48,899 --> 00:07:52,769
from seed I always recommend taking a

228
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,990
clone because who knows what you've got

229
00:07:52,769 --> 00:07:57,000
what if you grow from seed and you find

230
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:58,710
the most amazing product you've ever

231
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,149
found and you don't have a clone you're

232
00:07:58,709 --> 00:08:01,409
gonna be heartbroken you're gonna try to

233
00:08:00,149 --> 00:08:04,319
revenge it which is a whole another

234
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:06,330
podcast that's a pain in the ass but if

235
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,819
you have got a clone it's already ready

236
00:08:06,329 --> 00:08:11,219
to go if you cut a clone before you put

237
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:13,019
your plants in the flower that clone is

238
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:15,090
gonna go into a pot about two weeks

239
00:08:13,019 --> 00:08:17,189
later then it'll be ready to go into

240
00:08:15,089 --> 00:08:19,109
another pot a couple of weeks later you

241
00:08:17,189 --> 00:08:21,360
can cut a bunch more clones off of that

242
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:23,850
and have that ready to go by the time

243
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,410
that first crop is finished so you will

244
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:27,240
have decided which one is the keeper

245
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:29,160
probably around week seven or eight and

246
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:31,590
you can take a bunch of clones and have

247
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:33,420
them ready almost on time to fill that

248
00:08:31,589 --> 00:08:35,579
room when you cut down from the pheno

249
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:37,829
hunt you don't have to skip any time it

250
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:39,330
helps you move along quite quickly so

251
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:41,430
now our original plants have grown out

252
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:43,620
nice and large we have got clones from

253
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:45,509
everything they are properly labeled we

254
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:47,190
are confident that we'll at least one of

255
00:08:45,509 --> 00:08:49,950
those clones from each phenotype is

256
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:52,730
going to root then it is time to flower

257
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:54,089
my Fino hunt that's when the fun begins

258
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:56,159
we can

259
00:08:54,089 --> 00:08:58,110
a lot about our plants during the veg

260
00:08:56,159 --> 00:09:00,149
cycle we can tell if you like the growth

261
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:02,039
structure if you like the node spacing

262
00:09:00,149 --> 00:09:04,230
if you like the leaf size that's going

263
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:05,909
to indicate a lot of things the real

264
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:08,220
things we want to see will not reveal

265
00:09:05,909 --> 00:09:10,198
themselves until they are in flower so

266
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:12,269
early in flower the first things we need

267
00:09:10,198 --> 00:09:14,338
to pay attention to we need to look for

268
00:09:12,269 --> 00:09:16,919
males if you're growing from seed you've

269
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:18,870
got the opportunity to have males pop up

270
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:21,958
in your garden even if you are running

271
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:24,778
feminized seeds not all feminized seed

272
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:26,758
makers make seeds the same way some

273
00:09:24,778 --> 00:09:29,220
feminized seeds were made with poor

274
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:31,199
practices some feminized seeds were made

275
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:33,480
without auditioning the parrot plants

276
00:09:31,198 --> 00:09:37,229
properly before breeding with them you

277
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:39,720
still may find males or intersex traits

278
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:41,759
in feminized seeds just because the

279
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,370
package says feminized doesn't mean you

280
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:46,430
can get lazy and stop paying attention

281
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:49,438
so we need to look for males or

282
00:09:46,429 --> 00:09:52,169
hermaphrodites in our garden early in

283
00:09:49,438 --> 00:09:55,049
flower I would start looking day 3 day 4

284
00:09:52,169 --> 00:09:57,028
day 5 you're gonna start seeing signs of

285
00:09:55,049 --> 00:09:58,859
male pre flower as soon as you are

286
00:09:57,028 --> 00:10:01,350
certain that that plant is a male it

287
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:03,480
needs to come out of the garden we do

288
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:04,860
not want boys in there the girls are

289
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,778
going to start developing pistols

290
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:08,519
they'll be able to receive pollen when

291
00:10:06,778 --> 00:10:10,409
those males drop pollen are gonna seed

292
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:13,649
your plants we need to get the boys out

293
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:15,509
as soon as possible I do plan to talk

294
00:10:13,649 --> 00:10:17,039
more in depth about sexing our plants in

295
00:10:15,509 --> 00:10:19,318
a future episode when we get into the

296
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:21,328
flowering phase but quickly let's talk

297
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:24,419
about identifying a male and a female

298
00:10:21,328 --> 00:10:26,338
cannabis plant early in Flour when I am

299
00:10:24,419 --> 00:10:28,318
trying to identify the sex of a cannabis

300
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:31,050
plant there are two spots I like to look

301
00:10:28,318 --> 00:10:33,838
and I find those spots very reliable the

302
00:10:31,049 --> 00:10:35,609
very tip-top bud will be the first spot

303
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:38,249
to show you sex when you throw those

304
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:40,169
plants into flower also lower on the

305
00:10:38,249 --> 00:10:41,909
plant where you've got an intersection

306
00:10:40,169 --> 00:10:43,229
you've got the little peace sign you've

307
00:10:41,909 --> 00:10:45,240
got two branches coming off and you've

308
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:47,220
got the main stock coming up right there

309
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:49,409
at that intersection it loves to tell

310
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:50,939
you if it is a boy or a girl so a few

311
00:10:49,409 --> 00:10:53,850
days into flower our plants will start

312
00:10:50,938 --> 00:10:56,519
giving us signs of male or female sex if

313
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:58,379
you grab a branch and look closely there

314
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:59,730
will be the main branch coming up then

315
00:10:58,379 --> 00:11:02,159
there will be a little shoot coming off

316
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:05,188
of that where that chute splits off

317
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:06,928
there will be signs of sex right at that

318
00:11:05,188 --> 00:11:07,889
intersection right inside of that little

319
00:11:06,928 --> 00:11:10,919
V there will be

320
00:11:07,889 --> 00:11:12,568
signs of sex if you see a wart like

321
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:14,458
thing popping up right there if you see

322
00:11:12,568 --> 00:11:16,409
a little tiny acorn popping up right

323
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:18,958
there if it's got a ball coming out of

324
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:21,269
there that is probably a male plant if

325
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:23,368
it looks like it's got a hair coming out

326
00:11:21,269 --> 00:11:25,739
just one little pistol maybe two little

327
00:11:23,369 --> 00:11:28,439
pistol hairs doing a peace sign that is

328
00:11:25,739 --> 00:11:30,720
a female so at the intersections at the

329
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:32,938
nodes you will see either little hairs

330
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,309
coming out or you may see what looks

331
00:11:32,938 --> 00:11:37,168
like balls now be careful in early flour

332
00:11:35,308 --> 00:11:39,019
because sometimes those little balls are

333
00:11:37,168 --> 00:11:41,458
actually calyxes and it can be confusing

334
00:11:39,019 --> 00:11:44,339
so if you have identified something that

335
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:47,308
you think may be a male flower mark that

336
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:49,079
plant say arise number seven looks like

337
00:11:47,308 --> 00:11:51,149
it could be a boy write that down

338
00:11:49,078 --> 00:11:52,918
somewhere and then every day when you go

339
00:11:51,149 --> 00:11:55,649
in that garden head right over to number

340
00:11:52,918 --> 00:11:57,568
seven and look at the progress if those

341
00:11:55,649 --> 00:11:59,278
balls that are on the plant start

342
00:11:57,568 --> 00:12:01,139
drooping and hanging down that is

343
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:02,938
definitely a male it's growing a set of

344
00:12:01,139 --> 00:12:05,909
balls you need to get that boy out of

345
00:12:02,938 --> 00:12:08,248
there if that ball starts putting out a

346
00:12:05,909 --> 00:12:10,618
long hair that is a calyx and you've got

347
00:12:08,249 --> 00:12:12,028
a female plant up toward the top of the

348
00:12:10,619 --> 00:12:14,339
plant we should see a little bit of

349
00:12:12,028 --> 00:12:16,350
production you will either see buds that

350
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:18,209
look like dandelions those are your

351
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:20,249
girls if they're getting hairs the white

352
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:22,498
furry pistols are popping out those are

353
00:12:20,249 --> 00:12:23,939
females that's what you want if it looks

354
00:12:22,499 --> 00:12:26,189
like you're making little sets of

355
00:12:23,938 --> 00:12:28,139
bananas up at the top those are your boy

356
00:12:26,188 --> 00:12:29,639
plants we need to get rid of those it

357
00:12:28,139 --> 00:12:31,678
may look like you've got a little bud

358
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:33,209
that is already loaded up with seeds

359
00:12:31,678 --> 00:12:35,759
those are not seeds

360
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:38,488
those are pollen sacks we need to get

361
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:41,188
that boy out of the room immediately I

362
00:12:38,489 --> 00:12:43,619
can only describe males and females so

363
00:12:41,188 --> 00:12:46,498
much through words with the podcast it

364
00:12:43,619 --> 00:12:48,569
is your responsibility as a ganja farmer

365
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:50,220
to Google what a male and female

366
00:12:48,568 --> 00:12:52,918
cannabis plant look like you need some

367
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:55,110
images get ahead of yourself go look

368
00:12:52,918 --> 00:12:57,629
before you put your plants in to flower

369
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:59,699
do not make the mistake of thinking I

370
00:12:57,629 --> 00:13:03,509
can identify a male plant and then let

371
00:12:59,698 --> 00:13:05,038
that male go by day 10 day 14 he's gonna

372
00:13:03,509 --> 00:13:07,230
be dropping pollen and you're going to

373
00:13:05,038 --> 00:13:08,730
have a pollinated crop if you're a new

374
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:10,949
grower that is very discouraging

375
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:13,079
everything just went to [ __ ] your main

376
00:13:10,948 --> 00:13:14,998
goal is to produce a crop with no seeds

377
00:13:13,078 --> 00:13:16,888
you just reduced potency you just

378
00:13:14,999 --> 00:13:19,230
reduced harvest weight you definitely

379
00:13:16,889 --> 00:13:20,970
reduced retail value everything is not

380
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:21,550
how you want it if you've got seeds in

381
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:24,399
there so

382
00:13:21,549 --> 00:13:27,009
be very careful to get the boys out very

383
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:28,450
very early now if you were observing

384
00:13:27,009 --> 00:13:29,289
your plants and your plants show

385
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:31,420
ballsacks

386
00:13:29,289 --> 00:13:33,610
and they show hairs they need to go

387
00:13:31,419 --> 00:13:34,208
immediately those are hermaphrodite

388
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:36,278
plants

389
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:38,049
I know it's 2018 and we're supposed to

390
00:13:36,278 --> 00:13:39,578
be acceptable I do not accept

391
00:13:38,049 --> 00:13:42,338
hermaphroditic plants in my garden for

392
00:13:39,578 --> 00:13:44,559
any reason they must go we're trying to

393
00:13:42,339 --> 00:13:46,600
produce high-grade seedless cannabis and

394
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:48,969
a hermaphrodite plant is going to ruin

395
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:50,470
our whole goal of a seedless garden so

396
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:52,089
get rid of the males and get rid of

397
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:53,350
their hermaphrodites if you were not

398
00:13:52,089 --> 00:13:55,390
sure if that plant is a male or

399
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:58,000
hermaphrodite pay very close attention

400
00:13:55,389 --> 00:14:00,159
to it keep an eye on that part you think

401
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,289
may be a male part it will start to open

402
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:04,000
up it will start to hang it will give

403
00:14:02,289 --> 00:14:06,159
you plenty of warning that it wants to

404
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,169
release pollen pay close attention

405
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:09,549
now once you've cold your boys and you

406
00:14:08,169 --> 00:14:11,409
think you are past the part of the

407
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:13,419
plants revealing sex if you were growing

408
00:14:11,409 --> 00:14:15,850
from seed you still need to pay

409
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:18,578
attention for hermaphrodites it is not

410
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:20,950
uncommon for things to reveal intersex

411
00:14:18,578 --> 00:14:23,889
traits late in flower sometime around

412
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:26,079
week 7 or week 8 or especially week 9

413
00:14:23,889 --> 00:14:28,389
and if you push them real hard its way

414
00:14:26,078 --> 00:14:30,939
likely to see them toward week 10 so pay

415
00:14:28,389 --> 00:14:34,179
attention to the hermaphrodite traits in

416
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:36,490
your plants if a plant shows herm late

417
00:14:34,179 --> 00:14:38,708
in flower you've got some considerations

418
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:41,829
to make if it didn't pop up until week 9

419
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:43,719
that may be okay if that weed is fire if

420
00:14:41,828 --> 00:14:45,789
you just produce some amazing product

421
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:48,070
and that plant Herms late in the bloom

422
00:14:45,789 --> 00:14:49,179
cycle that may be okay we're gonna cut

423
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:50,770
the plants down before that

424
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:53,109
hermaphrodite is able to cause us any

425
00:14:50,769 --> 00:14:55,360
problems also a lot of their

426
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:58,539
hermaphrodite plants that show intersex

427
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:00,190
traits late in flower produce sterile

428
00:14:58,539 --> 00:15:02,199
male flowers they won't even produce

429
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:04,000
pollen that can pollinate a room it'll

430
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,528
pop out a couple nanners and they'll dry

431
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,809
up immediately they won't ever produce

432
00:15:05,528 --> 00:15:09,549
pollen so that is up to you if you get a

433
00:15:07,809 --> 00:15:11,169
plant that does hermaphrodite late and

434
00:15:09,549 --> 00:15:13,509
flower if it's not going to cause

435
00:15:11,169 --> 00:15:15,578
problems and it produces amazing product

436
00:15:13,509 --> 00:15:17,708
it may be worth keeping around that is

437
00:15:15,578 --> 00:15:19,539
something for you to consider also if

438
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:21,849
you ever share that clone with people

439
00:15:19,539 --> 00:15:23,620
maybe let them know hey bro at the end

440
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:25,870
of week 9 this one might throw a couple

441
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:27,250
of nanners on you as an experienced

442
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:27,730
grower that's something I'm familiar

443
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,169
with

444
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:31,420
that's something I'm comfortable with

445
00:15:29,169 --> 00:15:34,208
that's something I can deal with very

446
00:15:31,419 --> 00:15:35,289
many of the chem dog derived strains

447
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:37,029
will hermana

448
00:15:35,289 --> 00:15:39,009
if you let them go past nine weeks that

449
00:15:37,029 --> 00:15:40,809
is not rare if you let it go too long

450
00:15:39,009 --> 00:15:43,029
it'll throw out a couple of nanners

451
00:15:40,809 --> 00:15:44,889
but those nanners don't contain any

452
00:15:43,029 --> 00:15:46,240
pollen they will not pollinate anything

453
00:15:44,889 --> 00:15:48,069
they'll just pop up a couple of male

454
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,720
bananas right at the end so the way to

455
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:51,129
solve that either cut it down right

456
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,480
before that happens because I know when

457
00:15:51,129 --> 00:15:54,700
it happens it happens

458
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,769
at day 70 so cut them down about day 68

459
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:58,570
everything should be cool and I've also

460
00:15:56,769 --> 00:16:00,429
grown that plant enough to know that

461
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:02,230
those male flowers don't produce any

462
00:16:00,429 --> 00:16:04,539
pollen so even if I do let it finish if

463
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:06,220
I let it go 70 72 days it's still not

464
00:16:04,539 --> 00:16:08,409
going to cause a problem and even if

465
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:09,879
they did spit out pollen I'm 72 days in

466
00:16:08,409 --> 00:16:11,319
the flower there's no time for anything

467
00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:13,149
to happen all of my pistols have been

468
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:15,129
shriveled up by then there's nowhere for

469
00:16:13,149 --> 00:16:16,870
that pollen to be received so you have

470
00:16:15,129 --> 00:16:19,330
things to consider if your plants are

471
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:21,370
hermaphroditic late in flower if it's

472
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:23,050
early in flower call them get rid of

473
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:25,179
them if it's an obvious from Aphrodite

474
00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:27,579
toss it if you've just got one flower

475
00:16:25,179 --> 00:16:29,229
laid in I would think about it now if

476
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:31,690
you've got one hermaphrodite flower late

477
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:33,759
in and that plant is only a 6 on a scale

478
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:35,620
of 10 you still call it if you've got a

479
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,149
9 or a 10 and a hermaphrodite flower

480
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:38,710
that's when you kind of consider your

481
00:16:37,149 --> 00:16:40,779
like is it worth that one herm or not

482
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:43,330
but that is a growers decision to make

483
00:16:40,779 --> 00:16:44,799
so that is a quick rant on sexing your

484
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:46,870
plants I do plan on going into more

485
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:49,209
depth on that in a future episode you

486
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:51,310
are looking for the little hairs or the

487
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:53,110
balls if it's got balls it's got to go

488
00:16:51,309 --> 00:16:56,049
if it's got hairs and balls it

489
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:57,220
definitely has to go now once we call

490
00:16:56,049 --> 00:16:59,709
the males and the potential

491
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:02,649
hermaphrodites you have probably got 40

492
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:05,049
to 60% of your remaining stock cannabis

493
00:17:02,649 --> 00:17:07,629
plants average about 50% male and 50%

494
00:17:05,049 --> 00:17:10,750
female so by day 14 you have probably

495
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:12,310
eliminated 40 to 60% of the room if you

496
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:14,920
started with 10 seeds you were probably

497
00:17:12,309 --> 00:17:17,349
down to about 5 you may have 6 you may

498
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:19,839
have 4 I'm gonna go with 5 for the rest

499
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:21,189
of this lesson so we've got 5 plants

500
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:22,809
that are in there finishing pots there

501
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:24,190
are about 2 weeks in the flower we've

502
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:25,750
pulled out all the males we've pulled

503
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:27,730
out all the hermaphrodites we are still

504
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:31,329
paying attention for intersex traits

505
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:32,980
we're also keeping a lot of notes write

506
00:17:31,329 --> 00:17:34,569
down everything you feed these plants

507
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:36,730
write down everything you spray on these

508
00:17:34,569 --> 00:17:39,309
plants right down the reactions of the

509
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:40,930
plants to those procedures if you see

510
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:42,669
one plant do something different than

511
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:45,250
all of the others as a reaction to

512
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:47,320
something you did document that that may

513
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:48,970
mean a lot to you in the future let's

514
00:17:47,319 --> 00:17:50,678
say that plant 1 and plant

515
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:52,179
I have become the two best keepers out

516
00:17:50,679 --> 00:17:53,320
of this phenol hunt and you need to

517
00:17:52,179 --> 00:17:55,659
narrow it down to one

518
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:57,668
maybe that weird note you wrote about

519
00:17:55,659 --> 00:17:59,200
plant number one will be the reason you

520
00:17:57,669 --> 00:18:02,470
call that one and the reason you keep

521
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:04,630
number five so keep a lot of notes so I

522
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:06,548
do plan to do in-depth lessons on each

523
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:08,380
week of the bloom cycle I'm going to

524
00:18:06,548 --> 00:18:10,658
break it down in two trimesters will do

525
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:12,580
weeks one through three four through six

526
00:18:10,659 --> 00:18:14,169
and seven through nine and we'll talk

527
00:18:12,579 --> 00:18:16,269
about that in depth we're gonna

528
00:18:14,169 --> 00:18:18,190
fast-forward a little bit through the

529
00:18:16,269 --> 00:18:19,690
grow cycle here in the phenotype talk

530
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:22,150
and we're gonna get toward the end of

531
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:23,980
the harvest during the grow phase during

532
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:26,110
the bloom phase our plants got the same

533
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:27,640
exact treatment we've only got five of

534
00:18:26,109 --> 00:18:29,288
them it should have been fairly easy to

535
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,970
treat them all the same they got the

536
00:18:29,288 --> 00:18:32,589
same amount of light they got the same

537
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:34,659
amount of lollipop being the same type

538
00:18:32,589 --> 00:18:37,029
of pruning the same type of topping the

539
00:18:34,659 --> 00:18:38,890
exact same feedings the exact same pest

540
00:18:37,029 --> 00:18:41,200
management the exact same folio feedings

541
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:43,090
you get my point we treated them all the

542
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,730
same so that we can see reliable

543
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:47,798
outcomes from each seedling now just

544
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:50,950
like any crop make sure you flush for

545
00:18:47,798 --> 00:18:53,950
ten to fourteen days before harvest then

546
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:56,048
harvest I have done a long and in-depth

547
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:58,480
episode on harvesting and drying and

548
00:18:56,048 --> 00:18:59,918
curing our plants if you need tips on

549
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,079
drying and curing your freshly harvested

550
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:05,559
cannabis plants I recommend you listen

551
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:07,808
to episode 326 titled drying and curing

552
00:19:05,558 --> 00:19:10,480
I will give you a detailed step-by-step

553
00:19:07,808 --> 00:19:13,029
lesson on drying and curing your freshly

554
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,409
harvested cannabis so you've got to grow

555
00:19:13,029 --> 00:19:16,629
it you've got to flower it then you've

556
00:19:14,409 --> 00:19:18,490
got to flush it then harvest it then dry

557
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:20,860
it and cure it and trim it guess what

558
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:23,140
you get to do next you get to have a

559
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:24,579
smoke party depending on how much you

560
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:26,020
grew depending on how many people you

561
00:19:24,579 --> 00:19:27,849
trust and how many friends you've got

562
00:19:26,019 --> 00:19:31,418
you get to have a few people come over

563
00:19:27,849 --> 00:19:33,308
and test your phyno hunt this is one of

564
00:19:31,419 --> 00:19:35,350
the most fun and rewarding parts of

565
00:19:33,308 --> 00:19:37,089
growing cannabis you started with ten

566
00:19:35,349 --> 00:19:39,399
seeds about a hundred and twenty days

567
00:19:37,089 --> 00:19:40,869
ago and now you've got a small group of

568
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:43,360
close friends at your house helping you

569
00:19:40,869 --> 00:19:46,149
narrow it down to decide what plant is

570
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:47,469
going to be part of your future grow now

571
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:49,929
when you and your friends are narrowing

572
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:51,490
down which phenotype to select you get

573
00:19:49,929 --> 00:19:53,320
to make the final decision don't let

574
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:55,359
anybody sway you on the final decision

575
00:19:53,319 --> 00:19:57,970
because you are the grower you are the

576
00:19:55,359 --> 00:20:00,609
one doing the work this is your art you

577
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:02,409
get to decide but what I like to do is

578
00:20:00,609 --> 00:20:02,769
after everything is dried and cured and

579
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:05,050
we're ready

580
00:20:02,769 --> 00:20:06,730
to smoke it I get Mike over I get Kevin

581
00:20:05,049 --> 00:20:09,369
over I bring a couple other folks over

582
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:11,140
and I give them five little buds and if

583
00:20:09,369 --> 00:20:12,489
we've got time to do it we'll smoke them

584
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:14,110
all right here we'll just take a couple

585
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:15,309
bong rips of each or whatever and see

586
00:20:14,109 --> 00:20:17,289
what it all tastes like see what it

587
00:20:15,309 --> 00:20:19,240
smells like and look for what you're

588
00:20:17,289 --> 00:20:21,250
looking for are you looking for flavor

589
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:23,380
are you looking for a specific aroma are

590
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:25,000
you looking for a specific effect are

591
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:26,860
you looking for a bag appeal if you're

592
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,869
growing like I said earlier if you are a

593
00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:31,000
retail market grower you're probably

594
00:20:28,869 --> 00:20:33,339
going for some bag appeal you're going

595
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,410
to need the buds that look the best also

596
00:20:33,339 --> 00:20:36,730
you may want something that is unique if

597
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:38,740
you've got something that smells like

598
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:40,750
oranges or strawberries or blueberries

599
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:42,579
we've all got that if you've got

600
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:45,220
something that smells like oranges and

601
00:20:42,579 --> 00:20:47,289
gas and cherries and dirty feet and gets

602
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:49,930
you high as [ __ ] and finishes in 60 days

603
00:20:47,289 --> 00:20:52,119
you just found gold that is probably the

604
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:54,009
one you want to keep so find the one

605
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:55,839
that works best for you let your friends

606
00:20:54,009 --> 00:20:57,879
do a little tasting and let them kind of

607
00:20:55,839 --> 00:21:00,459
vote on it they may agree they may not

608
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:02,170
decide what works best for you it's just

609
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:03,850
great to have input from your friends

610
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:07,060
and it's always a good time to have a

611
00:21:03,849 --> 00:21:09,099
little phyno hunt party with the crew so

612
00:21:07,059 --> 00:21:12,190
here's a quick breakdown of a Fino hunt

613
00:21:09,099 --> 00:21:15,059
the main point is to find the outlier in

614
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:17,620
a population of seeds we do so by

615
00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:20,169
germinating a batch of seeds in that

616
00:21:17,619 --> 00:21:22,089
process we remove the problematic plants

617
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:22,690
which may be males hermaphrodites or

618
00:21:22,089 --> 00:21:25,419
mutants

619
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:27,279
then we take clones before we flower our

620
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:29,230
plants we carefully label those plants

621
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:31,180
to match the clones so we've got plant

622
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:33,309
one and clone one plant two and clone

623
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:34,390
two that way when we're done we've got

624
00:21:33,309 --> 00:21:36,549
mother plants we're gonna talk about

625
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:38,350
that a little more in just a second so

626
00:21:36,549 --> 00:21:39,819
we've popped seeds we've removed the

627
00:21:38,349 --> 00:21:42,279
problems we've got clones

628
00:21:39,819 --> 00:21:45,250
now we flour out our plants in that

629
00:21:42,279 --> 00:21:47,799
process take a lot of notes so you know

630
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:50,230
what you did we are cannabis consumers

631
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:51,639
we may have fuzzy memories I like to

632
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:53,740
smoke before I work in the garden

633
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:56,770
sometimes I may forget some details

634
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:57,279
that's why I write down everything that

635
00:21:56,769 --> 00:21:59,259
notepad

636
00:21:57,279 --> 00:22:01,509
isn't gonna forget anything that Google

637
00:21:59,259 --> 00:22:03,369
document won't forget anything my high

638
00:22:01,509 --> 00:22:06,640
ass will probably forget a couple of

639
00:22:03,369 --> 00:22:08,259
details write your [ __ ] down so finish

640
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:11,259
the crop get it all the way to the end

641
00:22:08,259 --> 00:22:12,670
flush it harvest dry and cure do a

642
00:22:11,259 --> 00:22:15,220
little smoke test with your friends

643
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:16,630
decide which one you like the best what

644
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:18,400
works for your garden well we're

645
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:20,380
for you what works for your clientele

646
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,900
are you growing for a medical patient

647
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:24,880
what works best for them when I get the

648
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:26,590
opportunity I like to send my finished

649
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,780
products to a lab for testing

650
00:22:26,589 --> 00:22:30,789
you would be surprised at how many

651
00:22:28,779 --> 00:22:32,470
plants we select is the keeper that are

652
00:22:30,789 --> 00:22:34,659
not the highest tester in the batch

653
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:36,549
sometimes the highest tester isn't the

654
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:38,410
one with the best flavor sometimes the

655
00:22:36,549 --> 00:22:40,389
one with the highest test does not bring

656
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:42,040
the best high when you smoke it

657
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:44,800
sometimes those lab results are

658
00:22:42,039 --> 00:22:47,019
impressive but we did not choose the one

659
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:49,539
that gave us the best results based on

660
00:22:47,019 --> 00:22:51,250
our smoke test sometimes we did choose

661
00:22:49,539 --> 00:22:53,529
the one that matches up with the test

662
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:55,299
but not always and if it's more common

663
00:22:53,529 --> 00:22:57,369
that we don't agree with the lab test is

664
00:22:55,299 --> 00:22:58,720
which one is our keeper another thing

665
00:22:57,369 --> 00:23:00,939
you're gonna find when you do a phenol

666
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,799
hunt you will find two that you really

667
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:04,809
really want to keep it'll be one that

668
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:06,369
smells real well and smokes real well

669
00:23:04,809 --> 00:23:08,109
and gets you super-high and there will

670
00:23:06,369 --> 00:23:10,089
be one that does all of that pretty well

671
00:23:08,109 --> 00:23:11,949
but it harvests way better being a

672
00:23:10,089 --> 00:23:13,509
grower that's always hard to decide I

673
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:15,160
always keep the one that smokes better

674
00:23:13,509 --> 00:23:17,319
we can just grow more next month

675
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:18,790
try not select because it's pretty try

676
00:23:17,319 --> 00:23:21,970
not to select because it harvests the

677
00:23:18,789 --> 00:23:25,119
most try to select based on effect based

678
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:27,730
on potency based on desirability based

679
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:29,109
on marketability there's enough [ __ ]

680
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:31,329
out there that looks really good on

681
00:23:29,109 --> 00:23:33,039
Instagram and doesn't smoke worth a [ __ ]

682
00:23:31,329 --> 00:23:35,470
so even if your plants aren't super

683
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:37,450
photogenic if they do what you need when

684
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:39,400
you smoke them when you and your market

685
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:41,350
consume them that's exactly what you're

686
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,640
aiming for so that is the phenotype you

687
00:23:41,349 --> 00:23:45,519
want to find find the one that works

688
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:47,950
best for you that is a custom phenotype

689
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:50,920
for you your clientele and your garden

690
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:52,539
now earlier I mentioned mother plants we

691
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:54,009
took clones off of these plants before

692
00:23:52,539 --> 00:23:56,349
we flowered them so in a grow room

693
00:23:54,009 --> 00:23:58,329
somewhere we've got five plants just

694
00:23:56,349 --> 00:24:00,369
hanging out there in veg maybe you were

695
00:23:58,329 --> 00:24:01,869
proactive maybe you decided around week

696
00:24:00,369 --> 00:24:03,519
seven that you really like to rise

697
00:24:01,869 --> 00:24:05,079
number three so you went in there and he

698
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:06,549
found that arise mother plant number

699
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:07,929
three and you took ten clones

700
00:24:06,549 --> 00:24:09,669
they're already vegging they're getting

701
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:10,960
big so that as soon as you harvest you

702
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:13,360
can throw those plants in there and you

703
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:15,490
can run a rise number three again maybe

704
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:17,500
you were waiting for this smoke test to

705
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:19,750
find out which one to run again either

706
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:21,670
way you have got that number that you

707
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:23,289
decide that plant is hanging out in the

708
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:25,060
bedroom it's in there you just got to go

709
00:24:23,289 --> 00:24:27,339
get it and take a bunch of clones off of

710
00:24:25,059 --> 00:24:29,379
it and run it again if you narrowed it

711
00:24:27,339 --> 00:24:30,579
down to two that you like cut a few

712
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:32,620
clones off of each one

713
00:24:30,579 --> 00:24:34,389
run them again side by side now you've

714
00:24:32,619 --> 00:24:36,789
got a larger batch of each one to decide

715
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:38,470
from you can run it again maybe change

716
00:24:36,789 --> 00:24:40,240
the nutrients maybe change something in

717
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:41,620
the room and see if the two phenotypes

718
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,240
do something different with different

719
00:24:41,619 --> 00:24:45,250
environments maybe that will help you

720
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:46,839
decide on which one to keep either way

721
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:48,700
you choose to do it after your tasting

722
00:24:46,839 --> 00:24:50,649
party with your friends you've got that

723
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:52,120
backup plant in the bedroom you've got a

724
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:54,040
rise number three just over there

725
00:24:52,119 --> 00:24:56,259
waiting to take a bunch of clones so you

726
00:24:54,039 --> 00:24:58,450
can grow it again forever now the thing

727
00:24:56,259 --> 00:25:00,460
is keep that plant alive listen to that

728
00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:01,809
episode about mother plants then you can

729
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:03,279
keep that arise number three around

730
00:25:01,809 --> 00:25:04,899
forever you can have a reliable

731
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:06,399
consistent medicine that works for you

732
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:08,440
that works for your garden and your

733
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,870
people will learn to rely on you for

734
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:12,850
that product ladies and gentlemen that

735
00:25:10,869 --> 00:25:14,529
is my quick talk on phenol hunting I

736
00:25:12,849 --> 00:25:16,240
hope I made that nice and clear for you

737
00:25:14,529 --> 00:25:17,710
phenol hunting is one of my favorite

738
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,509
things to do in a grow that's always a

739
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:21,190
great time you get some seeds you get to

740
00:25:19,509 --> 00:25:23,109
find out what's in there you narrow it

741
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:24,430
down to one and then a guy like me as

742
00:25:23,109 --> 00:25:26,169
soon as you're down to that one you

743
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:28,090
start another phenol hunt and then I'm

744
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:29,350
always adding a new one and pulling an

745
00:25:28,089 --> 00:25:30,819
old one out of the garden there's always

746
00:25:29,349 --> 00:25:32,230
something coming in and something going

747
00:25:30,819 --> 00:25:34,509
out so that I've always got some fresh

748
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:35,710
