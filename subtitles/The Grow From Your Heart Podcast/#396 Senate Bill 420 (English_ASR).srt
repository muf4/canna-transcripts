[Music]

2
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:05,099
kinda hard to focus with chris farley

3
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:06,719
flipping up his shades and just staring

4
00:00:05,099 --> 00:00:11,669
at me over and over again isn't it I've

5
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:14,070
forgotten how much I miss that man I was

6
00:00:11,669 --> 00:00:15,990
headed yeah that was amazing that

7
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:18,690
dredged up a lot of fields I didn't know

8
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:19,829
I still had and I forgot how much I miss

9
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,990
him this is comedy

10
00:00:19,829 --> 00:00:23,219
so people are probably wondering why

11
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:24,479
we're starting the podcast like this I'm

12
00:00:23,219 --> 00:00:27,149
just gonna type ad sitting on the table

13
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,589
random gift comment yeah he's gonna read

14
00:00:27,149 --> 00:00:30,419
a comment that's right above this and

15
00:00:28,589 --> 00:00:32,520
Chris Farley is here just flipping up

16
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:35,189
his shades and popping the shades just

17
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,960
looking at us with that face I imagine

18
00:00:35,189 --> 00:00:38,789
he sees booty with that face he's making

19
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,370
he sees booty he's looking up lifting up

20
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:43,519
them shades like that's that's not this

21
00:00:41,369 --> 00:00:46,769
kind of Beach but I appreciate it face I

22
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,180
see it like a car wash happening you

23
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:49,320
know we could probably press pause and

24
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:52,079
we could probably see in the reflection

25
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:56,909
of those glass sunglasses what he's

26
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:59,250

69

71
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,830
it's a good memory to bring up I gave

72
00:02:29,699 --> 00:02:33,659
Mike a little bit of a dab earlier and I

73
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:34,980
watched it just destroy his lungs he

74
00:02:33,659 --> 00:02:37,139
coughed for several minutes and I'm

75
00:02:34,979 --> 00:02:38,280
fighting kind of a head cold and I

76
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:39,599
didn't want to kill him again so I

77
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,489

78
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,689

143
00:04:56,168 --> 00:05:00,819
cannabis but in a situation where I took

144
00:04:58,629 --> 00:05:02,680
my first dab I was a little scared of

145
00:05:00,819 --> 00:05:06,519
clearing the dab after watching the guy

146
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:09,189
pass clean to the f out I apologize my

147

you're not even the right color so I

152
00:05:16,689 --> 00:05:19,329
can't want to recap on what Aldridge

153
00:05:18,189 --> 00:05:21,579
said because Mike was trying to steal

154
00:05:19,329 --> 00:05:21,969
the Thunder by coughing over it what are

155
00:05:21,579 --> 00:05:24,728

159
00:05:27,189 --> 00:05:34,959
the show hear myself over myself so said

160
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:36,310
I call it wasted cannabis but he was in

161
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:38,109
a situation where he took his first step

162
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:40,300
and he was scared to clear it because I

163
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:41,770
was there when Aldridge took his first I

164
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:43,780
have actually gave him his first stab

165
00:05:41,769 --> 00:05:46,120
and we did it at the dad lounge in

166
00:05:43,779 --> 00:05:48,009
Colorado Springs and what he's talking

167
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,209
about is moments before I gave him his

168
00:05:48,009 --> 00:05:50,589
first ad we were hanging out we're

169
00:05:49,209 --> 00:05:52,209
getting all set up at the table I've got

170
00:05:50,589 --> 00:05:53,409
a DAB scooped up for him I'm about to

171
00:05:52,209 --> 00:05:55,120
give him a DAB I can see that he's

172
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:56,470
nervous he's telling me bro I'm so

173
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,728
nervous to take my first dab and I'm

174
00:05:56,470 --> 00:06:00,789
trying to make him feel comfortable and

175
00:05:57,728 --> 00:06:02,050
calm and then I hear this noise and if

176
00:06:00,788 --> 00:06:04,478
anybody can't hear that through the mics

177
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:06,668
it was a loud table thunk it was a

178
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:08,589
person just collapsing they took a DAB

179
00:06:06,668 --> 00:06:11,079
and they just [ __ ] fell right over

180
00:06:08,589 --> 00:06:13,089
onto the table and knocked glass off of

181
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:14,800
the table cleaned off the table anything

182
00:06:13,089 --> 00:06:16,179
like drinks and pipes and bongs you

183
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:20,020
could hear it all smash onto the ground

184
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:22,000
it didn't sound pretty me being a very

185
00:06:20,019 --> 00:06:23,168
experienced consumer and somebody who

186
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,418
wants to mind my own business

187
00:06:23,168 --> 00:06:26,889
I just sat there I did not get up i sat

188
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:29,620
right in the seat where I was

189
00:06:26,889 --> 00:06:30,819
Aldridge did decide to get up and go see

190
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:32,288
what was going on and he's like that

191
00:06:30,819 --> 00:06:33,639
dude passed clean the [ __ ] out and I was

192
00:06:32,288 --> 00:06:35,918
like cool sit down it's time to do it

193
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:38,199
dad and I could tell he was like oh no

194
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:39,639
he didn't want to be [ __ ] fatality

195
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:40,420
number two that day so he was a little

196
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:42,759
bit scared

197
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:44,620
bro you did a really good job with your

198
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:46,689
first dab don't feel like such a noob

199
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:48,519
you were a dabber now you're part of the

200
00:06:46,689 --> 00:06:51,160
crew so I think it's funny that you were

201
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:52,599
so nervous to take your first stab and I

202
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:56,020
think it was just great timing that that

203
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:57,520
dude passed he said clean the f out so

204
00:06:56,019 --> 00:06:59,409
and dude you don't have to apologize for

205
00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:00,849
wasting cannabis that was less than a

206
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:02,140
half a dad that you didn't consume and

207
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:03,939
honestly I'd rather you not smoke that

208
00:07:02,139 --> 00:07:05,319
whole thing then once you get all weird

209
00:07:03,939 --> 00:07:09,189
and paranoid the first time we hang out

210
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:12,459
yeah I remember the don't waste it

211
00:07:09,189 --> 00:07:14,199
mentality that was so prevalent when we

212
00:07:12,459 --> 00:07:16,810
were younger I think we just sort of

213
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:19,659
outgrew it like at a certain point like

214
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:22,660
you'd rather your friend not overdo it

215
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:24,520
rather than see that half a hit get

216
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:26,830
blown into the room well now it's not

217
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:28,029
six of us pitching on a dime bag and

218
00:07:26,829 --> 00:07:29,620
everybody trying to get as high as we

219
00:07:28,029 --> 00:07:31,449
can off the [ __ ] three joints and

220
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:33,519
there's six of us here so it's and we're

221
00:07:31,449 --> 00:07:34,990
all we've got several grams over here if

222
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:36,189
you take a DAB and you choke and blow it

223
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:38,920
up into the air that's one for the dead

224
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:41,019
homies I'm not too stressed on it one of

225
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:42,490
the other I knew there was a YouTube

226
00:07:41,019 --> 00:07:45,339
submission for an answer to this

227
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:48,430
question and I Adam on YouTube called

228
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:50,579
says it's called mop mommy's milk you

229
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:53,290
should always finish your mommy's milk I

230
00:07:50,579 --> 00:07:55,449
would definitely call that go with

231
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:57,129
mothers rather than mommy's if I was

232
00:07:55,449 --> 00:07:59,560
gonna use that term but I gotta say I

233
00:07:57,129 --> 00:08:00,909
prefer buffalo fart I think yeah I think

234
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:03,790
for the first time I'm gonna say that

235
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:05,770
buffalo fart wins say wins that one it's

236
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:08,530
not a terrible term it is not once you

237
00:08:05,769 --> 00:08:10,089
pair it to the alternative I'm gonna

238
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:11,500
stick with Reebok just cuz that's what

239
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:13,239
we've always said in my circle and I bet

240
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,949
if we went rebonds pretty good too

241
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,780
that's a solid term if we went back to

242
00:08:14,949 --> 00:08:18,969
where we used to go smoke back over at

243
00:08:16,779 --> 00:08:20,619
uh at the Red Room we pulled out the

244
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:23,200
bong man I wonder how many people just

245
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:24,879
got flashbacks of the Red Room somebody

246
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,620
said buffalo fart nobody would know what

247
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,120
we meant but if we said clear Yuri bomb

248
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:30,550
somebody would know exactly what we

249
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:33,159
meant yeah

250
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:36,759
I hadn't heard buffalo fart and forever

251
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:38,649
in about a year ago we were in a room

252
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:41,439
with a group of people in the afternoon

253
00:08:38,649 --> 00:08:43,120
and one of the people in the room was

254
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,089
sort of famous for not being able to hit

255
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:48,068
a bomb correctly they can

256
00:08:46,089 --> 00:08:51,459
you need to draw through the bowl and

257
00:08:48,068 --> 00:08:53,558
into the bong repeatedly taking like sip

258
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:55,748
hits off the top of that you know yeah

259
00:08:53,558 --> 00:08:57,519
yeah but taking sip hits off the top of

260
00:08:55,749 --> 00:09:00,579
the bong while continuously pulling more

261
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:02,709
and more smoke into the the apparatus

262
00:09:00,578 --> 00:09:06,370
and then they'd hand it off with like

263
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:09,338
nine sipped hits taken off of it in a

264
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:10,899
huge cloud still inside it and one day

265
00:09:09,339 --> 00:09:12,819
I'd made the mistake of just clearing it

266
00:09:10,899 --> 00:09:13,929
normally and while I was hacking in

267
00:09:12,818 --> 00:09:15,639
Kaufmann somebody was like dude you

268
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:17,769
never suck a buffalo fart out what's

269
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:19,089
wrong with you oh and I about died

270
00:09:17,769 --> 00:09:21,639
because I hadn't heard the term in a

271
00:09:19,089 --> 00:09:25,089
decade suck a buffalo fart out just

272
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:27,188
makes it way differences I think that's

273
00:09:25,089 --> 00:09:29,439
part of where the term came yes I agree

274
00:09:27,188 --> 00:09:31,899
but man buffalo fart should be blown out

275
00:09:29,438 --> 00:09:37,058
not sucked it tastes different when you

276
00:09:31,899 --> 00:09:38,649
say it that well it's got a flavor Mike

277
00:09:37,058 --> 00:09:40,240
had a couple of technical difficulties

278
00:09:38,649 --> 00:09:42,970
I've stuttered a couple of times let's

279
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,409
put this podcast back on the adult rails

280
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:45,579
I don't want to say it don't rails that

281
00:09:44,409 --> 00:09:47,558
sounds like we're about to do something

282
00:09:45,578 --> 00:09:48,909
even extra [ __ ] weird right let's put

283
00:09:47,558 --> 00:09:51,759
it back on a normal track here let's get

284
00:09:48,909 --> 00:09:53,980
a podcast going Mike I invited you to

285
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:57,699

286
00:09:53,980 --> 00:10:01,720

287
00:09:57,698 --> 00:10:03,659
bill 420 what can you tell me and my

288
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:07,449

the audience and myself our audience and

290
00:10:07,448 --> 00:10:14,258
the listeners and I well dear listeners

291
00:10:10,659 --> 00:10:20,278
and I want to be included Senate bill

292
00:10:14,259 --> 00:10:23,649
420 is a federal decriminalization bill

293
00:10:20,278 --> 00:10:26,499
they're describing it as a bill to

294
00:10:23,649 --> 00:10:30,009
federally decriminalize regulate and tax

295
00:10:26,499 --> 00:10:33,909
marijuana products they've gone ahead

296
00:10:30,009 --> 00:10:38,740
and reserved the name s period 420 or

297
00:10:33,909 --> 00:10:40,928
Senate bill 420 senators can go ahead

298
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:43,990
and reserve a number for the year in

299
00:10:40,928 --> 00:10:48,188
like last year they used s 420 as well

300
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:52,178
but that was 20 18 s 420 this is 20 19 s

301
00:10:48,188 --> 00:10:53,139
420 matching legislation has been

302
00:10:52,178 --> 00:10:54,610
submitted to the House of

303
00:10:53,139 --> 00:10:56,798
Representatives under a totally

304
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:58,509
different number but they had submitted

305
00:10:56,798 --> 00:11:00,808
to both houses when they do stuff like

306
00:10:58,509 --> 00:11:00,808
this

307
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:08,590
this is actually three bills 420 421 and

308
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:09,940
422 if you really want to pull the the

309
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:10,590
language of the bill and read it for

310
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:13,900
yourself

311
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:16,600
but the package of legislation was filed

312
00:11:13,899 --> 00:11:19,509
by Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon on

313
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:22,509
February 7th of this year it seeks to

314
00:11:19,509 --> 00:11:24,429
update tax law by providing for the

315
00:11:22,509 --> 00:11:26,620
taxation and regulation of marijuana

316
00:11:24,429 --> 00:11:30,909
products and for other purposes

317
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:32,889
basically banking the bill is officially

318
00:11:30,909 --> 00:11:36,879
called the marijuana Revenue and

319
00:11:32,889 --> 00:11:39,639
Regulation Act and then the article I'm

320
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:43,439
skimming comments on the number 420

321
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:46,449
honored honors the marijuana community I

322
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:48,640
shake my head when they use for 20 and

323
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:50,259
7/10 for stuff like this I feel like

324
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:51,909
it's the cop show where the cop is

325
00:11:50,259 --> 00:11:56,590
insisting on using the street name in

326
00:11:51,909 --> 00:11:58,509
the interview it's just don't you look

327
00:11:56,590 --> 00:12:00,040
insane when you do it but that's just my

328
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:03,370
personal take you don't like it what the

329
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:09,429
cops call it the cush it's just it's

330
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:11,590
cringe worthy it's just no don't

331
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:12,909
when you can avoid it avoid it but

332
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:15,639
listeners I don't think any of you were

333
00:12:12,909 --> 00:12:16,809
going to submit federal legislation so I

334
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:22,000
don't know why I'm ranting about this

335
00:12:16,809 --> 00:12:25,629
it's just one of my tangents going with

336
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,610
the 420 representative for the House of

337
00:12:25,629 --> 00:12:31,870
Representatives or a blue Meyer has

338
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:36,659
reserved HR 424 a House bill that will

339
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:39,970
do similar things mainly for Oregon but

340
00:12:36,659 --> 00:12:42,309
this s 420 widens bill is part of a

341
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:44,710
legislative package that would lay the

342
00:12:42,309 --> 00:12:47,549
foundation for responsible comprehensive

343
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:49,389
federal regulation of marijuana

344
00:12:47,549 --> 00:12:51,549
according to a statement from the

345
00:12:49,389 --> 00:12:54,309
senator who serves on the Senate's

346
00:12:51,549 --> 00:12:56,169
Committee on Finance as part of the

347
00:12:54,309 --> 00:12:57,789
package bloom are filed an identical

348
00:12:56,169 --> 00:13:00,519
piece of legislation in the house just

349
00:12:57,789 --> 00:13:05,110
called HR 1 1 to 0

350
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:06,879
that's the companion bill to s 420 as I

351
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:11,589
mentioned earlier this package of bills

352
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:13,328
includes s 421 and s 422 the former

353
00:13:11,589 --> 00:13:14,709
would aim to shrink the gap

354
00:13:13,328 --> 00:13:18,338
between federal and state marijuana

355
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:20,169
policies and the latter aims to treat

356
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:21,670
marijuana businesses like any other

357
00:13:20,169 --> 00:13:25,360
small business when it comes to their

358
00:13:21,669 --> 00:13:27,909
tax bills which means the end of 280e or

359
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:30,999
at least to a tes application to the

360
00:13:27,909 --> 00:13:32,919
state legal marijuana businesses if

361
00:13:30,999 --> 00:13:36,639
you're in the industry you know how big

362
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:40,539
that could be for us right now this bill

363
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:42,909
is in its infancy and given all the

364
00:13:40,539 --> 00:13:46,088
shenanigans the federal government level

365
00:13:42,909 --> 00:13:48,688
recently who knows how smooth this

366
00:13:46,089 --> 00:13:50,829
process is going to be basically

367
00:13:48,688 --> 00:13:52,899
listeners if you haven't been following

368
00:13:50,828 --> 00:13:57,278
marijuana politics as closely as I have

369
00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:59,198
for the last decade every year at least

370
00:13:57,278 --> 00:14:02,649
one or two senators get together and

371
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:05,019
submit a bill like this and ten times

372
00:14:02,649 --> 00:14:06,759
out of ten it goes nowhere it dies in

373
00:14:05,019 --> 00:14:10,600
committee you never hear about it after

374
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:12,639
the initial press release saying there's

375
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:15,040
a marijuana legalization bill here's

376
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:16,629
it's funny number I'm and then it's

377
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:18,039
going to committee next week and then

378
00:14:16,629 --> 00:14:22,589
that's all you ever hear is it dies in

379
00:14:18,039 --> 00:14:24,849
committee I have more hope now there's

380
00:14:22,589 --> 00:14:28,269
we're going into another presidential

381
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:30,899
election this next round we decide if we

382
00:14:28,269 --> 00:14:33,759
keep Trump or pick anybody else and

383
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:36,778
along with that stuff like this is going

384
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:40,119
to get a lot more national attention

385
00:14:36,778 --> 00:14:42,129
Trump's White House has played the

386
00:14:40,119 --> 00:14:45,639
marijuana question a lot different than

387
00:14:42,129 --> 00:14:47,649
their predecessors surprise surprise

388
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:49,539
not that that's a good or a bad thing

389
00:14:47,649 --> 00:14:50,649
yet we really don't know that's the

390
00:14:49,539 --> 00:14:52,028
bananas thing about the Trump

391
00:14:50,649 --> 00:14:53,379
administration is it's really hard to

392
00:14:52,028 --> 00:14:57,489
tell if they're going left right or

393
00:14:53,379 --> 00:14:59,678
forward and on any issue and so we have

394
00:14:57,489 --> 00:15:03,399
no idea if they're anti cannabis Pro

395
00:14:59,678 --> 00:15:06,428
cannabis or ignoring cannabis so we

396
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:07,928
could see the White House support one of

397
00:15:06,428 --> 00:15:10,958
the several federal pieces of

398
00:15:07,928 --> 00:15:15,428
legislation that would either deregulate

399
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:18,998
cannabis federally reschedule it or let

400
00:15:15,428 --> 00:15:20,289
States expand their existing programs if

401
00:15:18,999 --> 00:15:22,720
they've legalized that already at the

402
00:15:20,289 --> 00:15:24,759
state level or at changes to banking

403
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,259
bills we could see the White House get

404
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:28,808
behind any of those or

405
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:31,539
of those it's really an up in the air

406
00:15:28,808 --> 00:15:32,769
question at this point traditionally the

407
00:15:31,539 --> 00:15:34,988
white house stays out of anything

408
00:15:32,769 --> 00:15:36,548
marijuana related they just preferred

409
00:15:34,989 --> 00:15:38,048
not to take a stance and when they're

410
00:15:36,548 --> 00:15:40,808
pressed they say we were waiting for

411
00:15:38,048 --> 00:15:42,970
Congress to act and that's sort of a

412
00:15:40,808 --> 00:15:44,618
tall order right now but waiting for

413
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:47,798
Congress to act is what this bill would

414
00:15:44,619 --> 00:15:50,229
be so we'll see where it goes so what

415
00:15:47,798 --> 00:15:52,808
are the next steps who can approve or

416
00:15:50,229 --> 00:15:54,220
veto this what can happen what's the

417
00:15:52,808 --> 00:15:55,358
next chain of command I'm gonna think of

418
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:57,819
dad so what are the next two or three

419
00:15:55,359 --> 00:16:00,788
steps in the chain of command okay so

420
00:15:57,818 --> 00:16:02,738
this bill goes to committee first the

421
00:16:00,788 --> 00:16:04,899
committee digs through and looks to see

422
00:16:02,739 --> 00:16:08,350
like this the Senate have the authority

423
00:16:04,899 --> 00:16:11,678
to to regulate in an legislate stuff

424
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:13,600
like this they debate the merits of the

425
00:16:11,678 --> 00:16:15,608
bill sometimes sometimes they debate

426
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,829
debate the optics of the bill or don't

427
00:16:15,609 --> 00:16:19,538
debate it at all and it just never comes

428
00:16:17,828 --> 00:16:21,248
up for discussion and committee and dies

429
00:16:19,538 --> 00:16:22,989
there you want to clear that dad since

430
00:16:21,249 --> 00:16:24,788
your lungs are already half collapsed

431
00:16:22,989 --> 00:16:26,949
yeah go ahead and fill that out okay so

432
00:16:24,788 --> 00:16:28,028
there are several more steps here I'm

433
00:16:26,948 --> 00:16:29,649
gonna cut you off because you've already

434
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:30,999
given myself in the listeners the idea

435
00:16:29,649 --> 00:16:33,369
that there are several steps and several

436
00:16:30,999 --> 00:16:35,949
opportunities for this to just get nixed

437
00:16:33,369 --> 00:16:37,689
this could go away this could completely

438
00:16:35,948 --> 00:16:41,349
be something we talked about and didn't

439
00:16:37,688 --> 00:16:42,519
come to any fruition what kind of I know

440
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:43,869
you choked and I want to ask you

441
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:45,668
questions I'm gonna try to ramble just

442
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:46,600
like you do for me when I'm dead the

443
00:16:45,668 --> 00:16:48,548
next thing I want to know is what kind

444
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:50,798
of timeline do we have before we're

445
00:16:48,548 --> 00:16:54,608
gonna start seeing progress of this

446
00:16:50,798 --> 00:16:56,649
moving forward and yeah what kind of

447
00:16:54,609 --> 00:16:57,819
timeline if it does get shot down is

448
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:59,798
that gonna be in a month is that gonna

449
00:16:57,818 --> 00:17:00,938
be in three months and then how long are

450
00:16:59,798 --> 00:17:05,168
we gonna know if this actually gets

451
00:17:00,938 --> 00:17:08,019
approved so in hmm sorry listeners in

452
00:17:05,169 --> 00:17:10,959
three to six months we'll know if this

453
00:17:08,019 --> 00:17:13,720
specific bill is gonna move forward in

454
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:19,120
any meaningful way and the likelihood of

455
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:20,889
that is very very small okay now once it

456
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:22,778
gets shot down is that like a game over

457
00:17:20,888 --> 00:17:25,119
or can they go back to the drawing board

458
00:17:22,778 --> 00:17:26,558
cross a few words out reinsert a few

459
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:29,079
words and bring it back or is that done

460
00:17:26,558 --> 00:17:31,990
for the year at that point so at that

461
00:17:29,079 --> 00:17:33,599
point there's really no bringing back

462
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:37,298
this version of the bill this year

463
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:39,909
however there's several other bills that

464
00:17:37,298 --> 00:17:41,650
do very similar things in

465
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:44,050
ways that have already been submitted or

466
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:46,870
will be submitted later this year I sort

467
00:17:44,049 --> 00:17:49,059
of mentioned one earlier out of Oregon

468
00:17:46,869 --> 00:17:51,579
and rep blue Meyers office I think is

469
00:17:49,059 --> 00:17:52,659
sponsoring it it's getting submitted

470
00:17:51,579 --> 00:17:54,819
through the House of Representatives

471
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:57,460
first so we need to have a back-up plan

472
00:17:54,819 --> 00:17:58,689
if this does not work and it's not like

473
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:00,850
this is the first time this has ever

474
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:03,309
happened this happens every year and has

475
00:18:00,849 --> 00:18:07,659
for eight or ten or fifteen years in a

476
00:18:03,309 --> 00:18:10,839
row now the website is we've done this

477
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:15,340
before with other things where the feds

478
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:17,789
say one thing in the state's slowly one

479
00:18:15,339 --> 00:18:20,470
by one go and now we're gonna do this

480
00:18:17,789 --> 00:18:22,359
and at a certain point usually when you

481
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:25,360
get to about 30 35 states and

482
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:27,069
disagreement with the feds the feds are

483
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:29,889
forced to really re-examine their

484
00:18:27,069 --> 00:18:31,720
position and decide like if they did

485
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:35,770
with raising the alcohol or the drinking

486
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:38,440
age to 21 if they really start making

487
00:18:35,769 --> 00:18:40,960
threats to bring States in line or if

488
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:43,059
they do with so many other things where

489
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:45,460
they go you know what our policy is out

490
00:18:43,059 --> 00:18:47,379
of alignment with the views of the

491
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:50,380
American public in federal policy

492
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:53,620
finally gets changed because so many

493
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:55,570
states have taken that step first and

494
00:18:53,619 --> 00:18:57,879
we're sort of reaching traditional

495
00:18:55,569 --> 00:18:59,740
tipping point numbers now awesome at

496
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:02,860
least with medical marijuana and in

497
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:05,650
honestly if you look at federal action

498
00:19:02,859 --> 00:19:12,179
on medical marijuana stuff they told us

499
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:16,300
to go [ __ ] ourselves from 1970 till 2014

500
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:18,340
2013 ish and finally they started saying

501
00:19:16,299 --> 00:19:21,490
okay maybe some of you have a point

502
00:19:18,339 --> 00:19:23,439
we'll start allowing more people to do

503
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:27,339
the medical research to look for medical

504
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:30,580
benefits the FDA finally called uncle

505
00:19:27,339 --> 00:19:33,519
for the first time in 60 years and said

506
00:19:30,579 --> 00:19:34,869
to open up more production facilities

507
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:37,420
other than just the University of

508
00:19:34,869 --> 00:19:38,859
Mississippi for a cannabis product for

509
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:40,779
these tests now that's a great way you

510
00:19:38,859 --> 00:19:42,639
kind of set me up I have this set up as

511
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:44,649
one of my later on questions do you

512
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,810
think if this does go through that this

513
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:48,040
will be the beginning of the end and a

514
00:19:46,809 --> 00:19:49,480
lot of people in a lot of other places

515
00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:51,220
are gonna say it's already the beginning

516
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,940
of the end but the beginning of the end

517
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:55,519
of any Medical Marijuana Pro

518
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:57,288
if we have a national decriminalized

519
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:59,778
cannabis program do you think that's

520
00:19:57,288 --> 00:20:03,378
gonna start destroying medical marijuana

521
00:19:59,778 --> 00:20:11,720
programs yes and no okay what we know

522
00:20:03,378 --> 00:20:14,178
now is sort of horrible not to be

523
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:16,368
overdramatic or anything but when you

524
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:18,710
look at all traditional forms of

525
00:20:16,368 --> 00:20:21,738
medicine and it's not just like Big

526
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:24,829
Pharma pills but all medicine whether

527
00:20:21,739 --> 00:20:27,679
it's splinting a broken bone or healing

528
00:20:24,829 --> 00:20:30,678
a cut or stitches all medicine goes

529
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:33,619
through a specific process and we were

530
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:36,320
forced to go outside of the traditional

531
00:20:33,618 --> 00:20:37,428
processes for medical marijuana it's

532
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:39,918
part of the reason we had to build our

533
00:20:37,429 --> 00:20:42,259
own testing labs in infrastructure and

534
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:44,450
[ __ ] was because we can't use the labs

535
00:20:42,259 --> 00:20:48,618
the tests literally every other product

536
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:51,200
on the planet a lot of that's gonna go

537
00:20:48,618 --> 00:20:54,738
away and we'll be able to use the

538
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:57,080
infrastructure that's already there what

539
00:20:54,739 --> 00:20:59,470
we have now get expanded drastically is

540
00:20:57,079 --> 00:21:02,928
the research into other cannabinoids

541
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:08,450
really explodes right now I don't know

542
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:10,940
any of the any THC B or C BG or CBC

543
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:13,759
breeders we're gonna start to see the

544
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:15,798
emergence of people focusing on lots of

545
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:18,679
stuff we don't see now as this expanse

546
00:21:15,798 --> 00:21:21,858
random note you know where the THC v has

547
00:21:18,679 --> 00:21:24,109
been commonly found that is from what I

548
00:21:21,858 --> 00:21:27,439
understand it is in the African landrace

549
00:21:24,108 --> 00:21:29,658
strains such as Durbin poison also in

550
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,038
the storm or the Double Dragon it comes

551
00:21:29,659 --> 00:21:33,049
through in the Double Dragon if your lab

552
00:21:31,038 --> 00:21:34,548
tests it it's got the THC V from the

553
00:21:33,048 --> 00:21:36,408
Durbin so a lot of the African land

554
00:21:34,548 --> 00:21:39,739
races are bringing that but do you

555
00:21:36,409 --> 00:21:41,840
remember how much the the breeding in

556
00:21:39,739 --> 00:21:44,379
the genetics game changed when people

557
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:46,519
like you and me got access to labs

558
00:21:44,378 --> 00:21:50,209
that's around the same time that

559
00:21:46,519 --> 00:21:51,829
everybody went CBD crazy so yes we're

560
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:53,598
gonna see the same thing on a much

561
00:21:51,829 --> 00:21:57,428
grander scale I'm watching it with the

562
00:21:53,598 --> 00:22:00,858
hemp game right now it's tremendous I

563
00:21:57,429 --> 00:22:02,629
could do a whole episode on on hemp

564
00:22:00,858 --> 00:22:04,009
testing right now with those there's two

565
00:22:02,628 --> 00:22:05,449
cases going on right now where people

566
00:22:04,009 --> 00:22:06,380
were shipping him and got in trouble oh

567
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:07,670
yeah

568
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:09,050
there are other podcasts I've been

569
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:11,450
covering those pretty well so I haven't

570
00:22:09,049 --> 00:22:13,430
delved in delray is that a word to adult

571
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:14,630
yep I haven't done that I haven't delved

572
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:15,830
into them because I feel like they've

573
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:16,550
been covered but if you ever want to

574
00:22:15,829 --> 00:22:19,220
talk about it

575
00:22:16,549 --> 00:22:22,519
I could go on a massive rim but I want

576
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:24,380
to stay kind of close to this with with

577
00:22:22,519 --> 00:22:26,720
medical anyway we have we've seen quite

578
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:28,930
a bit of federal action that we they've

579
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:33,049
just been adamant not to do for the last

580
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:34,460
50 or 60 years from an outsider's

581
00:22:33,049 --> 00:22:36,829
perspective that doesn't watch this

582
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:39,920
stuff as closely the action we've seen

583
00:22:36,829 --> 00:22:41,629
federally seems pretty minimal the steps

584
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:44,360
the feds have taken have all been super

585
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:45,830
baby step and it doesn't make a lot of

586
00:22:44,359 --> 00:22:48,589
sense if you don't follow this stuff

587
00:22:45,829 --> 00:22:50,629
really closely because until very

588
00:22:48,589 --> 00:22:54,709
recently we just had no progress for

589
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:58,970
decades like we beat these [ __ ] in

590
00:22:54,710 --> 00:23:02,809
court in 82 the year I was born the feds

591
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:05,299
got taken to court in the DEA they

592
00:23:02,809 --> 00:23:09,649
rigged the game they had their own logic

593
00:23:05,299 --> 00:23:12,049
DEA logic was the judge for the case and

594
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:14,690
ended up ruling in our favor saying

595
00:23:12,049 --> 00:23:17,539
cannabis is clearly by all evidence

596
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:20,720
presented remarkably medically active

597
00:23:17,539 --> 00:23:22,369
and remarkably safe I mean that ruling

598
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,049
eventually led to the creation of the

599
00:23:22,369 --> 00:23:27,799
federal medical marijuana program where

600
00:23:24,049 --> 00:23:30,889
they send pot to patients which is a

601
00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:33,740
whole other episode as well but we've

602
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:36,050
won in court it in federal court with

603
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:40,370
their own ringer judge is the decider

604
00:23:36,049 --> 00:23:42,200
and we've still seen zero action until

605
00:23:40,369 --> 00:23:45,259
very very recently when the feds have

606
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:46,400
started to really move on this stuff and

607
00:23:45,259 --> 00:23:48,529
I think we're gonna see a lot more

608
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:51,860
progress over the next few years but I

609
00:23:48,529 --> 00:23:54,049
mean that's assuming a lot of stuff you

610
00:23:51,859 --> 00:23:57,919
really never know where our wonderful

611
00:23:54,049 --> 00:24:01,759
president is gonna drive this bus I'm

612
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:03,140
gonna try to avoid that um so one thing

613
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:05,210
you said earlier that I think we should

614
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:06,920
clear up for listeners is what is the

615
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:08,150
difference between be criminalization

616
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:12,259
and legalization

617
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:15,980
okay so decriminalization the short

618
00:24:12,259 --> 00:24:19,910
version is end market consumers so

619
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:23,420
people that just smoke weed some get

620
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:26,630
taken out of the legal system for

621
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:28,370
cannabis it's still illegal to grow it

622
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:30,440
it's still illegal to have a bunch of it

623
00:24:28,369 --> 00:24:34,279
it's definitely still illegal to sell

624
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:36,200
some to your friend but if the cop says

625
00:24:34,279 --> 00:24:38,569
hey what are you doing wrong and the

626
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,610
only thing they can get you for is has a

627
00:24:38,569 --> 00:24:43,639
small personal amount of weed with them

628
00:24:40,609 --> 00:24:47,319
currently then you don't get in trouble

629
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:50,930
legally the first time that's

630
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:53,359
decriminalization without going to full

631
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:56,680
legalization you can't have things like

632
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:59,899
storefronts or zoning laws or taxes

633
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:02,360
that's the big two the big difference

634
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:06,740
between those two policies okay

635
00:25:02,359 --> 00:25:09,649
recently because you brought this up the

636
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:11,900
anti pot community has realized that we

637
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:14,440
should prohibit this is no longer an

638
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:16,940
effective argument and no one listens

639
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:20,150
basically as soon as they start talking

640
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:22,070
about arresting users and full-on

641
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:24,710
prohibition like we've traditionally had

642
00:25:22,069 --> 00:25:27,019
with cannabis people laugh at them and

643
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:29,180
go away and completely stop listening

644
00:25:27,019 --> 00:25:31,910
and so they've started pretending that

645
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:34,370
their decriminalization advocates they

646
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:37,519
don't want to see users go to jail which

647
00:25:34,369 --> 00:25:39,379
they don't think happens but they don't

648
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:40,879
want it to see it happen and they

649
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:43,400
pretend to be decriminalization

650
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:46,880
advocates which is weird because Vermont

651
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:50,540
basically did decriminalization last

652
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:53,300
year early last year I think through the

653
00:25:50,539 --> 00:25:56,559
legislature Vermont legalized but they

654
00:25:53,299 --> 00:25:59,149
legalized without any infrastructure or

655
00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:00,679
commercial industry it's just you're

656
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:03,860
allowed to grow a couple of plants at

657
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:06,259
home and keep what you harvest and maybe

658
00:26:03,859 --> 00:26:07,609
share it with an adult friend who comes

659
00:26:06,259 --> 00:26:10,220
to your house and doesn't leave with a

660
00:26:07,609 --> 00:26:12,319
lot I said bag up there in Vermont yeah

661
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:14,930
they're working on it was the first

662
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:17,779
attempt at a legislature to legalize and

663
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:19,670
they had a bunch anti pot people flood

664
00:26:17,779 --> 00:26:23,089
the state at the last minute and really

665
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:25,190
fear monger pretty hard and they got

666
00:26:23,089 --> 00:26:27,849
their governor to back off from a

667
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:30,140
commercial industry to just a

668
00:26:27,849 --> 00:26:31,579
decriminalization model but the anti

669
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:33,170
paka me that he didn't get behind that

670
00:26:31,579 --> 00:26:34,939
decriminalization model at all

671
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:36,830
they fought it they bitched about the

672
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:38,870
loss in Vermont and then six months

673
00:26:36,829 --> 00:26:40,669
later when Vermont started talking about

674
00:26:38,869 --> 00:26:42,859
doing the full commercial industry full

675
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:44,630
legalization they came out again and

676
00:26:42,859 --> 00:26:47,389
relaxed but this model you've got now is

677
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:53,630
terrible why would you expand it yeah

678
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:55,070
you can't be both that yeah one of the

679
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:57,290
best things I see coming out of this so

680
00:26:55,069 --> 00:26:58,819
far is the opportunity for banking

681
00:26:57,289 --> 00:27:02,240
that's one of the things that we like

682
00:26:58,819 --> 00:27:04,308
those huge there's independent banking

683
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:09,400
legislation that just had a hearing this

684
00:27:04,308 --> 00:27:14,149
week that looks to dial back to eighties

685
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:16,309
impact on legal cannabis businesses our

686
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:19,519
elected officials are really starting to

687
00:27:16,308 --> 00:27:21,500
understand that insisting a an industry

688
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:24,500
that does six to ten billion in business

689
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:27,950
a year operators cash only is not a

690
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:29,869
smart move if they want to be able to

691
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:32,509
easily confirm that a business is

692
00:27:29,869 --> 00:27:33,829
operating on the up-and-up operating is

693
00:27:32,509 --> 00:27:38,569
a cash-only business makes that a lot

694
00:27:33,829 --> 00:27:40,490
harder paying the taxes payroll and it

695
00:27:38,569 --> 00:27:42,230
makes you a huge target for thieves and

696
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:44,240
that comes with federal regulation is

697
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:46,190
the banking and tracking the money and

698
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,380
yeah that's part of it so I'm glad that

699
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:50,298
they're going to let us claim the money

700
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:52,010
I have friends talking about it now

701
00:27:50,298 --> 00:27:53,720
they're not sure they're gonna do it ray

702
00:27:52,009 --> 00:27:55,759
it's got to happen eventually there's so

703
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:57,620
much money in that industry there are

704
00:27:55,759 --> 00:28:00,440
folks like you and I who when we worked

705
00:27:57,619 --> 00:28:02,089
for The Grove where we worked we may go

706
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:03,980
to places and try to apply for credit

707
00:28:02,089 --> 00:28:05,629
for a new car or whatever we were trying

708
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:08,808
to buy and they'd say where do you work

709
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:10,280
and I'd say I throw out the the doing

710
00:28:08,808 --> 00:28:11,990
business has named their their

711
00:28:10,279 --> 00:28:13,609
development name I work for this company

712
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:15,798
and they'd say what is that it's a

713
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:17,119
dispensary grow and then you go yeah we

714
00:28:15,798 --> 00:28:19,910
don't give loans do you guys you can't

715
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:21,859
buy a car from us have a nice day if

716
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:23,929
this bill does pass and we can work with

717
00:28:21,859 --> 00:28:25,548
the banks people that have worked in

718
00:28:23,929 --> 00:28:26,929
this industry that are working hard

719
00:28:25,548 --> 00:28:28,720
they're working as managers as

720
00:28:26,929 --> 00:28:30,620
consultants they're working as

721
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,150
representatives for companies are doing

722
00:28:30,619 --> 00:28:34,308
real legitimate jobs they can actually

723
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:36,110
go and get loans for houses and pay

724
00:28:34,308 --> 00:28:38,089
their bills legitimately legitimately

725
00:28:36,109 --> 00:28:41,449
like they're trying to do so that'll be

726
00:28:38,089 --> 00:28:43,970
really advantageous no I did not like is

727
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:46,799
an employee having to take an envelope

728
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:48,990
full of cash to the bank I briefed

729
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:51,659
every other Friday right in even though

730
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:53,819
I was kind of in a weird situation where

731
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:55,740
I was working at the dispensary when the

732
00:28:53,819 --> 00:28:59,970
bank representative came in and baked

733
00:28:55,740 --> 00:29:02,430
for our employee accounts but even then

734
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:04,950
when I'd go to take my paycheck the

735
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:07,410
teller would see the huge stack of tens

736
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:09,840
and 20s and go oh I don't know I don't

737
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:12,480
want to know where this is from every

738
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:14,449
pay day I had to deal with that and I'm

739
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:18,539
sure there are people that aren't like

740
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:21,150
I'm a fairly large human it's I'm

741
00:29:18,539 --> 00:29:25,079
six-three 250 pounds like I'm a big

742
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:29,009
person people don't often bother me but

743
00:29:25,079 --> 00:29:32,549
I worked with a lot of 5-foot 201 pound

744
00:29:29,009 --> 00:29:35,460
female co-workers who were also leaving

745
00:29:32,549 --> 00:29:38,579
late at night with a huge envelope of

746
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:42,539
cash in their pocket and I I wasn't

747
00:29:38,579 --> 00:29:45,000
comfortable right how did they like it's

748
00:29:42,539 --> 00:29:47,369
just an it's not a tenable system it's

749
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,200
not the system is untenable there was a

750
00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:50,969
place another place which we work

751
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:54,450
together that only paid us every two

752
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:55,890
weeks and catch yep 20s because they

753
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:57,809
kept all the hundredths and 50s for

754
00:29:55,890 --> 00:29:59,580
themselves that plaits I got tens more

755
00:29:57,809 --> 00:30:01,649
often than not oh I get all the 20s it's

756
00:29:59,579 --> 00:30:04,859
yeah you were a few rungs of the ladder

757
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:06,509
for me um but I slowly level service and

758
00:30:04,859 --> 00:30:08,939
in customer service people were getting

759
00:30:06,509 --> 00:30:11,160
paid in 20s and 10's a lot more often

760
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:14,850
than not and you when you show up with

761
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:17,550
two weeks worth of paid and a moderate

762
00:30:14,849 --> 00:30:20,189
rate and you hand that to a bank teller

763
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:21,990
they got [ __ ] questions cuz the only

764
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:24,809
other people that come in with all tens

765
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:27,779
or sellin $10 crack rocks and you've got

766
00:30:24,809 --> 00:30:31,859
to explain oh no it's just my business

767
00:30:27,779 --> 00:30:34,160
is it's a cash-only store they can't pay

768
00:30:31,859 --> 00:30:36,689
me with the check because it's illegal

769
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:39,380
won't work with them raise huge pay and

770
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:42,570
so please help me longer this money I

771
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:45,360
it's cynical of me to think this but I

772
00:30:42,569 --> 00:30:47,759
think the anti pot crowd fights banking

773
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:49,049
access so hard they claim it's because

774
00:30:47,759 --> 00:30:51,480
they're afraid Marlborough is gonna

775
00:30:49,049 --> 00:30:53,940
invest in our company you and me start

776
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:56,220
and take over Big Tobacco is gonna tape

777
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:57,308
it take it over but I really think it's

778
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:59,169
because

779
00:30:57,308 --> 00:31:02,859
if you took the huge piles of cash out

780
00:30:59,169 --> 00:31:04,778
of the gun safes that infrequent

781
00:31:02,859 --> 00:31:06,998
dispensary robbers robberies would

782
00:31:04,778 --> 00:31:09,730
become even more infrequent and they

783
00:31:06,999 --> 00:31:11,319
would lose the talking point I feel like

784
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:12,639
that's why they fight so hard it's a

785
00:31:11,319 --> 00:31:14,109
good that's a good argument there I

786
00:31:12,638 --> 00:31:17,498
would agree with that like just because

787
00:31:14,109 --> 00:31:19,959
we pay rent reasonable federal taxes and

788
00:31:17,499 --> 00:31:22,240
are allowed to deposit our proceeds in

789
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:24,038
the bank like that doesn't automatically

790
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:26,558
mean anything other than the business is

791
00:31:24,038 --> 00:31:28,509
safer they pretend like it's we're gonna

792
00:31:26,558 --> 00:31:30,069
get huge angel investors from evil

793
00:31:28,509 --> 00:31:31,509
corporations and it's like thought we

794
00:31:30,069 --> 00:31:33,339
were evil on our own why do we need them

795
00:31:31,509 --> 00:31:35,349
the storefronts are there they're doing

796
00:31:33,339 --> 00:31:37,749
business people are employed by the

797
00:31:35,349 --> 00:31:39,219
place so there's Commerce to be done

798
00:31:37,749 --> 00:31:41,919
somebody's making money by being there

799
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:42,909
all day that person is gonna buy gas

800
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:44,470
they're gonna buy food in the area

801
00:31:42,909 --> 00:31:46,809
because they get a lunch break they

802
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:48,368
probably live within you know 10 or 15

803
00:31:46,808 --> 00:31:50,168
minutes maybe 20 minute drive away so

804
00:31:48,368 --> 00:31:51,398
they're paying rent in that community

805
00:31:50,169 --> 00:31:53,440
with the money they make at that

806
00:31:51,398 --> 00:31:55,479
dispensary people are shopping their

807
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:57,278
money's coming in money's going out it's

808
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:59,169
contributing to the community in

809
00:31:57,278 --> 00:32:01,839
Colorado as far as everything else is

810
00:31:59,169 --> 00:32:04,720
concerned are cannabis industry is just

811
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:06,398
like our ice cream industry or our

812
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:09,819
newspaper industry or our sneaker

813
00:32:06,398 --> 00:32:12,878
industry it's exactly the same until it

814
00:32:09,819 --> 00:32:15,490
comes to how they handle payments and

815
00:32:12,878 --> 00:32:17,219
and payments out and what they do with

816
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:19,929
the money after it shows up at the store

817
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:22,298
so if this does pass is there a business

818
00:32:19,929 --> 00:32:24,340
model in mind are they going to follow

819
00:32:22,298 --> 00:32:26,048
the Colorado regulation and regulate

820
00:32:24,339 --> 00:32:27,730
like alcohol or do they have a different

821
00:32:26,048 --> 00:32:31,329
idea that you've read the federal

822
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:34,628
legislation just removes the federal

823
00:32:31,329 --> 00:32:35,888
laws against it and allows States to do

824
00:32:34,628 --> 00:32:38,408
their own thing like they have with

825
00:32:35,888 --> 00:32:41,969
booze like Mississippi can decide to be

826
00:32:38,409 --> 00:32:46,450
the Utah of weed and do state-run stores

827
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:50,470
state-run grows only the state profits

828
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:51,999
from this they dial down potency or put

829
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:54,579
in purchase limits however they want and

830
00:32:51,999 --> 00:32:56,769
other states can go full-bore and say

831
00:32:54,579 --> 00:32:59,048
you can buy as much as you like okay I

832
00:32:56,769 --> 00:33:00,609
mean it lets each state kind of hammer

833
00:32:59,048 --> 00:33:04,538
it out for themselves for the most part

834
00:33:00,609 --> 00:33:05,918
which is like we do with most of the

835
00:33:04,538 --> 00:33:08,648
thing they got my attention is it's

836
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:10,659
called the cannabis Revenue Act or the

837
00:33:08,648 --> 00:33:13,748
marijuana revenue active of

838
00:33:10,659 --> 00:33:16,359
course it's got money involved well the

839
00:33:13,749 --> 00:33:18,999
feds are they're starting to get

840
00:33:16,358 --> 00:33:22,989
pressure from lawmakers we're like

841
00:33:18,999 --> 00:33:25,239
there's a rumor out in the world that I

842
00:33:22,989 --> 00:33:27,879
see a lot of anti platforms and a lot of

843
00:33:25,239 --> 00:33:30,460
uninformed cannabis discussions where

844
00:33:27,878 --> 00:33:32,858
they'd say the feds can't collect

845
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:34,329
cannabis taxes or federal taxes from

846
00:33:32,858 --> 00:33:36,038
cannabis businesses because they're

847
00:33:34,329 --> 00:33:37,989
illegally federal just [ __ ] nonsense

848
00:33:36,038 --> 00:33:42,519
illegal businesses still have to pay

849
00:33:37,989 --> 00:33:44,019
taxes if it's a full-on criminal

850
00:33:42,519 --> 00:33:47,460
enterprise they typically don't which is

851
00:33:44,019 --> 00:33:49,839
how Al Capone got busted right but that

852
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:51,399
law was already on the books when I woke

853
00:33:49,839 --> 00:33:53,108
up on got busts and is still very much

854
00:33:51,398 --> 00:33:55,238
in play today

855
00:33:53,108 --> 00:33:56,710
that's where 280e comes in it says if

856
00:33:55,239 --> 00:33:58,659
you run an illegal [ __ ] business you

857
00:33:56,710 --> 00:34:00,848
can't take federal tax deductions I'm

858
00:33:58,659 --> 00:34:03,759
like any other business would and that's

859
00:34:00,848 --> 00:34:06,398
why 280 is so impactful to the legal

860
00:34:03,759 --> 00:34:08,199
cannabis industry is it's legal in the

861
00:34:06,398 --> 00:34:10,779
state but it's not illegal federally so

862
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:13,118
we get triple [ __ ] on taxes triple

863
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:17,319
harmed so we pay almost 70 percent in

864
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:19,450
taxes that's not after we've hit the ten

865
00:34:17,318 --> 00:34:22,389
million dollar mark clarify that because

866
00:34:19,449 --> 00:34:24,250
that sounds egregious and like hyperbole

867
00:34:22,389 --> 00:34:26,079
but explain how that seventy percent who

868
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:27,878
is paying that seventy percent in taxes

869
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:29,798
so the business owner the business

870
00:34:27,878 --> 00:34:33,568
itself the business itself it's coming

871
00:34:29,798 --> 00:34:36,460
out of the sales yes surely every dollar

872
00:34:33,568 --> 00:34:39,489
okay so to use real numbers Colorado

873
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:42,278
sold just over a billion dollars worth

874
00:34:39,489 --> 00:34:44,199
of cannabis last year it's gonna end up

875
00:34:42,278 --> 00:34:46,628
being like 1.4 but we round to a billion

876
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:51,489
I can't visualize a billion dollars well

877
00:34:46,628 --> 00:34:55,808
like 600 million of that or more 650

878
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:58,919
million of that was taxes go down the

879
00:34:55,809 --> 00:35:02,319
remainder the 350 million left over

880
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:04,088
that's what the industry used to keep

881
00:35:02,318 --> 00:35:07,389
the lights on to do payroll

882
00:35:04,088 --> 00:35:11,558
it's what the owners profited is is that

883
00:35:07,389 --> 00:35:14,108
left overs so the state takes 15 percent

884
00:35:11,559 --> 00:35:16,089
off the top for excise when the cannabis

885
00:35:14,108 --> 00:35:18,489
is produced so it's grown in one

886
00:35:16,088 --> 00:35:20,230
facility then it's got to be taken to a

887
00:35:18,489 --> 00:35:22,479
retail location those are two separate

888
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:24,099
entities two separate environments when

889
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:29,679
it moves in the computer the

890
00:35:24,099 --> 00:35:32,079
2% taxes well when 15% for excise

891
00:35:29,679 --> 00:35:34,960
there's a special cannabis facts it's

892
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:37,720
like 10% there's a local sales tax it's

893
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:41,079
like 5% alrighty we're at 30%

894
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:43,358
yep keep it notes there's a couple of

895
00:35:41,079 --> 00:35:45,068
different little small taxes that bring

896
00:35:43,358 --> 00:35:47,588
the state up to like thirty three and a

897
00:35:45,068 --> 00:35:48,608
half percent or something like that I'm

898
00:35:47,588 --> 00:35:50,739
depending on which part of the state

899
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:55,210
you're standing in and then federal

900
00:35:50,739 --> 00:35:58,150
taxes that everybody pays usually coming

901
00:35:55,210 --> 00:36:00,130
around twenty twenty two percent because

902
00:35:58,150 --> 00:36:05,889
cannabis businesses aren't allowed to

903
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:07,329
deduct payroll inventory a number of

904
00:36:05,889 --> 00:36:09,429
other things the normal businesses the

905
00:36:07,329 --> 00:36:11,680
duck but normally if your business buys

906
00:36:09,429 --> 00:36:12,460
new chairs for the office that gets

907
00:36:11,679 --> 00:36:14,588
deducted right

908
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:16,478
not for cannabis businesses they can't

909
00:36:14,588 --> 00:36:19,599
take any deductions which brings their

910
00:36:16,478 --> 00:36:22,058
federal tax to 32 or 33 percent in

911
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:25,568
Pueblo County most of the businesses are

912
00:36:22,059 --> 00:36:27,278
paying 67 percent in taxes is so for

913
00:36:25,568 --> 00:36:29,558
each dollar they get sixty-seven percent

914
00:36:27,278 --> 00:36:31,630
could take sixty seven cents gets taken

915
00:36:29,559 --> 00:36:34,390
out of that dollar and divvied up to go

916
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:36,849
to taxes someone so the feds are

917
00:36:34,389 --> 00:36:40,108
collecting their share this money and

918
00:36:36,849 --> 00:36:43,539
it's starting to be a lot of money

919
00:36:40,108 --> 00:36:45,489
coast-to-coast the estimates last year

920
00:36:43,539 --> 00:36:48,940
for legal cannabis sales were seven and

921
00:36:45,489 --> 00:36:52,269
ten billion seven to ten billion that's

922
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:53,818
a lot of [ __ ] money and when the feds

923
00:36:52,268 --> 00:36:57,368
are taking thirty percent of that

924
00:36:53,818 --> 00:36:59,798
eventually somebody's gonna be like but

925
00:36:57,369 --> 00:37:03,309
you call them drug dealers right you're

926
00:36:59,798 --> 00:37:05,588
taking your cut are you sure that makes

927
00:37:03,309 --> 00:37:08,140
you part of the game in my opinion

928
00:37:05,588 --> 00:37:10,989
you're part of it yeah and you're

929
00:37:08,139 --> 00:37:13,748
definitely at least condoning if you

930
00:37:10,989 --> 00:37:15,519
came on my turf and you sold a hundred

931
00:37:13,748 --> 00:37:16,718
dollars worth of your drug of choice is

932
00:37:15,518 --> 00:37:18,488
just a hypothetical I don't have any

933
00:37:16,719 --> 00:37:20,469
turf so this is just a hypothetical if

934
00:37:18,489 --> 00:37:21,670
you stepped on my turf and you sold a

935
00:37:20,469 --> 00:37:23,259
hundred dollars worth of product I

936
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:24,278
walked up to you and said hey yeah I'm

937
00:37:23,259 --> 00:37:25,630
gonna beat the [ __ ] out of you and take

938
00:37:24,278 --> 00:37:27,159
all hundred or you just want to give me

939
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:29,108
ten bucks every time you sell one

940
00:37:27,159 --> 00:37:31,328
hundred you'd give me ten bucks I am now

941
00:37:29,108 --> 00:37:33,460
part of your crime right I'm taxing you

942
00:37:31,329 --> 00:37:35,680
that is I'm tan that is hood tax well no

943
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:37,750
if the cops discovered this you'd get in

944
00:37:35,679 --> 00:37:38,919
trouble too yep and that's base

945
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:41,860
what the feds are doing is they're

946
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:45,340
demanding legal cannabis businesses not

947
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:48,039
only pay federal taxes but pay inflated

948
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:49,390
federal taxes because the 280e and at

949
00:37:48,039 --> 00:37:51,460
the same time they go

950
00:37:49,389 --> 00:37:53,859
we appreciate you paying your taxes in a

951
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:55,300
timely manner we apologize for charging

952
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:55,780
you an extra fee because you paid in

953
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:59,170
cash

954
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:59,680
also these DEA agents if they ever get

955
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:01,300
bored

956
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:02,379
they're gonna come [ __ ] your life but

957
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:03,490
they're gonna take everything you've

958
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:05,200
owned they're gonna break everything

959
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:06,969
you've purchased they're gonna shoot

960
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:08,199
your [ __ ] dog and then they're gonna

961
00:38:06,969 --> 00:38:10,359
tell you it's your fault

962
00:38:08,199 --> 00:38:11,889
throw you in jail for six months when

963
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:13,210
all that's over they're not gonna get

964
00:38:11,889 --> 00:38:15,759
around to charging you because the

965
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:18,130
prosecutor knows the jury in your area

966
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:20,380
will be pissed but they were called for

967
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:22,480
jury duty over a [ __ ] weed store that

968
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:25,710
the state said was legal they've done

969
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:30,219
this before in a couple of places and

970
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:32,019
eventually that [ __ ] up situation is

971
00:38:30,219 --> 00:38:32,919
gonna come to a head I think we're

972
00:38:32,019 --> 00:38:36,280
headed there now

973
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:37,599
you and I ran a dispensary I'm pretty

974
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:40,180
proud of it we had the first dispensary

975

within city limits here in Pueblo we

978
00:38:44,829 --> 00:38:51,460

982
00:38:56,860 --> 00:39:02,380
meeting at one point with the city where

983
00:38:59,679 --> 00:39:04,690

984
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:06,309

986
00:39:06,309 --> 00:39:10,809

987
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:12,340
Councilman joked that the checks in the

988
00:39:10,809 --> 00:39:15,340
mail they'll send that [ __ ] back in the

989
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:18,280
city manager if looks could kill rate at

990
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:20,019

991
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:22,030
like no I'm [ __ ] cashed and spent

992
00:39:20,019 --> 00:39:24,489
[ __ ] don't tell him I send it back yeah

993
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:27,400
I never sent it back yeah well they took

994
00:39:24,489 --> 00:39:29,289
that what that car that car worth of tax

995
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:31,420
payment and less than a week later

996
00:39:29,289 --> 00:39:33,519
walked in with cease and desist letters

997
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:35,530
you can no longer do this so yeah they

998
00:39:33,519 --> 00:39:37,659
were happy to take that tax money the

999
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:38,860
men in the trial just like Mike said

1000
00:39:37,659 --> 00:39:42,219
we're like well what about all the tax

1001
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:43,809
money yeah right yeah they don't care

1002
00:39:42,219 --> 00:39:46,368
thank you he got to play ball for a

1003
00:39:43,809 --> 00:39:49,670
little while but at a certain point

1004
00:39:46,369 --> 00:39:51,829
there has to be movement there's enough

1005
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:53,659
elected officials now that understand

1006
00:39:51,829 --> 00:39:56,689
that the legal cannabis industry is far

1007
00:39:53,659 --> 00:39:59,028
preferable to the black market even if

1008
00:39:56,688 --> 00:40:01,788
you go ahead and believe all the crazy

1009
00:39:59,028 --> 00:40:04,579
[ __ ] people say cannabis does even if

1010
00:40:01,789 --> 00:40:06,589
you buy into all of that it's still more

1011
00:40:04,579 --> 00:40:08,359
beneficial for society to have it sold

1012
00:40:06,588 --> 00:40:09,889
in a storefront than it is on a street

1013
00:40:08,358 --> 00:40:12,199
corner we're going to consume cannabis

1014
00:40:09,889 --> 00:40:14,598
people want herb and it's something that

1015
00:40:12,199 --> 00:40:15,889
we can produce at home or in all kinds

1016
00:40:14,599 --> 00:40:17,689
of different places but I mean we can

1017
00:40:15,889 --> 00:40:20,118
produce it ourselves so it is going to

1018
00:40:17,688 --> 00:40:22,098
be around it is going to exist why not

1019
00:40:20,119 --> 00:40:23,809
make a few bucks off of it and stop

1020
00:40:22,099 --> 00:40:27,999
putting people in jail it'll clean out

1021
00:40:23,809 --> 00:40:30,949
some jail space it'll free up some like

1022
00:40:27,998 --> 00:40:33,048
6500 people a year are not getting

1023
00:40:30,949 --> 00:40:34,430
arrested for marijuana possession the

1024
00:40:33,048 --> 00:40:37,038
only I've said this before if the only

1025
00:40:34,429 --> 00:40:38,748
thing I ever did that was really illegal

1026
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:40,430
or criminal I I mean when I was younger

1027
00:40:38,748 --> 00:40:42,078
I was a [ __ ] [ __ ] but now that is

1028
00:40:40,429 --> 00:40:44,149
I'm gonna don't like random teenage

1029
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:45,890
vandalism doesn't right now the only

1030
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:47,420
thing I had to worry about was having

1031
00:40:45,889 --> 00:40:49,098
cannabis it was the only thing that I

1032
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:51,108
did as an adult that's the only crime I

1033
00:40:49,099 --> 00:40:53,269
break sometimes I would drive like a

1034
00:40:51,108 --> 00:40:55,219
complete [ __ ] [ __ ] but most of the

1035
00:40:53,268 --> 00:40:56,958
time I just had cannabis that's a listen

1036
00:40:55,219 --> 00:40:58,639
I really didn't French I didn't do the

1037
00:40:56,958 --> 00:41:00,228
two things at once because of the don't

1038
00:40:58,639 --> 00:41:03,018
break born of my white Mike's rules

1039
00:41:00,228 --> 00:41:05,629
don't break two laws at one time but now

1040
00:41:03,018 --> 00:41:08,389
that I don't have to worry about having

1041
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:11,959
my personal bag of weed or my dad's or

1042
00:41:08,389 --> 00:41:13,608
whatever with me I'm I feel so it's so

1043
00:41:11,958 --> 00:41:14,928
chill that's nice it's the only thing I

1044
00:41:13,608 --> 00:41:16,848
did it was illegal I'm no longer a

1045
00:41:14,929 --> 00:41:18,650
criminal I am an upstanding citizen I

1046
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:20,088
don't feel weird when I get pulled over

1047
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:22,369
I roll down the window and I smile at

1048
00:41:20,088 --> 00:41:24,380
the cop like own real fast huh I'm sorry

1049
00:41:22,369 --> 00:41:25,699
like instead of oh [ __ ] is he gonna [ __ ]

1050
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:27,259
my life up for this a little bit of weed

1051
00:41:25,699 --> 00:41:29,088
in my bag am I gonna go to jail for

1052
00:41:27,259 --> 00:41:30,769
however many days because I got two

1053
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:32,719
grams of herb and a little one-hitter in

1054
00:41:30,768 --> 00:41:35,659
my backpack a good dirty pipe in the

1055
00:41:32,719 --> 00:41:37,159
drank now I've got uh in a safe area in

1056
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:39,379
the car see my car doesn't have a trunk

1057
00:41:37,159 --> 00:41:41,268
so I've got to put my stuff in another

1058
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:43,699
container and then put that out of reach

1059
00:41:41,268 --> 00:41:44,899
as far as I can get it from me so that

1060
00:41:43,699 --> 00:41:47,150
it is obvious that I'm not trying to

1061
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:48,920
consume that product but I do carry I

1062
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:50,838
got my dad rig in there I got the

1063
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:52,519
Torchic at the carb cap I got multiple

1064
00:41:50,838 --> 00:41:54,558
[ __ ] layers of concentrates I keep in

1065
00:41:52,518 --> 00:41:55,938
a cooler with some ice packs in there so

1066
00:41:54,559 --> 00:41:57,439
that my concentrates don't get funky

1067
00:41:55,938 --> 00:41:59,899
also then when you get to wherever

1068
00:41:57,438 --> 00:42:00,239
