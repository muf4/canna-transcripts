heart podcast yes yeah 78 uh we're going

14
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,840
to skip the intro because Clint already

15
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:51,718
crashed the whole [ __ ] party and I

16
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,399

starts I had on this podcast when I'm

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,159
recording by myself it seems like I have

23
00:01:02,518 --> 00:01:05,478
a really hard time busting out the intro

24
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,680
when I'm alone but when there are people

25

163
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:51,399
have never tried to sell them it's so

164
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,800
fun that we just gave up on them

165
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:55,239
immediately I am uh thinking about

166
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,120
getting grow from your heart podcast

167
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,600
t-shirts made here eventually I'd Rock

168
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,000
one of those man hopefully by episode

169
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,600
100 I'll be able to give a a couple of

170
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,800
them away you should talk to Barrett

171
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,319
shout out to Barrett yes shout out to

172
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:08,360
Barrett is that last Leaf does he work

173
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:10,160
last Leaf I think is uh mo mo right okay

174
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,360
yes I thought they were together they

175
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,199
not Mo's not doing shirts though Mo does

176
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,879
like I think unless Barrett bought up

177
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:16,960
Mo's [ __ ] and they just call it the same

178
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:18,680

191
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:42,960
shook my hand the other day I recognized

00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:44,159
him and I waved at him and he recognized

193
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:46,918
me probably because I'm [ __ ]

194
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,759

197
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:57,160
after the show cool cuz we had actually

198
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:58,520
moved pretty fast I'm I'm getting rambly

199
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:00,520
again that's all right you're nice super

200
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:01,639
high dude

201
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:03,639
guys this is great because I've never

202
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:05,120
seen Clint this high and he's almost

203
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:07,120
uncomfortably high and I can see him

204
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,360
like resituate himself every few minutes

205
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,319
so it's great and that's going to lead

206
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,598
into something that we're going to talk

207
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:12,039
about in a little bit here too if we

208
00:07:10,598 --> 00:07:14,439
have time because Clint keeps uh talking

209
00:07:12,038 --> 00:07:16,399
a lot so uh I feel like you're uh four

210
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:19,199
episodes

211
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:20,478
later yes uh I was going to make a

212
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,120
reference and then I forgot the dude's

213
00:07:20,478 --> 00:07:24,800
name so we won't even do it it feels

214
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:27,199
like you are

215
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,840
um Pete holming me that's what's

216
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,680
happening here I'm being Pete Holmes if

217
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:32,399
you ever watch any of Doug Benson's

218
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:34,038
podcast Pete Holmes will love to just

219
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:37,758
interrupt and drag on

220
00:07:34,038 --> 00:07:39,800
and yes you're you're Pete holsing me so

221
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,038
uh we're going to do a little on 420

222
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,240
Doug came and did those comedy shows

223
00:07:41,038 --> 00:07:45,000
right at Comedy Works uh Clint and I and

224
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:48,560
a couple other people had the honor of

225
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,240
going to the third show that night um

226
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,759
which may have been a mistake I and

227
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,840
we've talked about that on the podcast

228
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:57,280
before yes yes we did so we downloaded

229
00:07:54,839 --> 00:08:01,318
the CD on the day that it came out and

230
00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:03,559
we listened to it and um so the fun part

231
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:06,120
that I noticed right away is he used the

232
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,839
opening from the show we attended for

233
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,840
sure he did uh yeah cuz he talks about

234
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:12,359
how he was trying to get too high oh

235
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:13,638
dude well yeah that that was definit and

236
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:17,199
it's not like you could have done that

237
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:19,240
twice no but even even later in the

238
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,879
album you can hear him and he's not that

239
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:23,720
high right and it's just like oh man I

240
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:25,120
wish I'd have went to those other shows

241
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:28,960
there were a couple of pieces that I'm

242
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:30,759
certain came uh from our show and then I

243
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:33,079
know that some I'm like oh he did not do

244
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:34,759
that at our show cuz he sounds awake but

245
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:37,680
one of my favorite parts of the entire

246
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:39,559
album is that on track one there are

247
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:42,598
multiple times when I can hear Clint

248
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:44,278
over laughing uh Clint is like a dick oh

249
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:45,959
no it's great dude because it's genuine

250
00:08:44,278 --> 00:08:48,360
but your laugh you're such a big dude

251
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:50,399
and your laugh is so low that it just

252
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,959
shakes the entire Comedy Club when you

253
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,919
laugh and we're in the front row in that

254
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:55,199
little pit area and there's a lot of

255
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:57,360
sound right there and dude you were

256
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:01,160
coming through on the mic so well and

257
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:03,079
you can just hear Clint like ha

258
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:04,719
it's so [ __ ] funny hearing your buddy

259
00:09:03,078 --> 00:09:06,879
laugh on a comedy album that's pretty

260
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,399
cool it was great now the the shitty

261
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:11,600
thing is the com Comedy album not that

262
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:13,559
funny you know what Doug's my friend you

263
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,440
know what sucks I might have been the

264
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:18,119
funniest thing on that

265
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,760
album the funniest thing please don't

266
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,879
tell Doug Benson I I think ball weed

267
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:24,360
might be the funniest thing on that

268
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:26,360
album God he would hate me he might but

269
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,759
you know you're being honest uh no I

270
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,519
just didn't think it was that good we

271
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:31,120
went and saw that show and that I had a

272
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,240
just against it already though you know

273
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,278
what I mean because I was already a

274
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:38,079
little mad at him so the first track is

275
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:41,200
25 minutes of Doug reading tweets on his

276
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:43,000
Comedy album like I know that's it's

277
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,959
what he does in his live show but he's

278
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,759
just riffing off of them yeah if I was

279
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:48,359
going to do a comedy album if I were a

280
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:49,958
comedian I would put together I would

281
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:52,079
Joe Rogan that [ __ ] I would put

282
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:53,679
together the tightest one hour that I

283
00:09:52,078 --> 00:09:55,639
could comp and it might take you two

284
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:58,479
years to do it but you're real happy to

285
00:09:55,639 --> 00:10:00,319
do it like that exactly yeah uh [ __ ] man

286
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,720
so the first album is 25 minutes of him

287
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,600
reading tweets the or the first track

288
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,480
the second track is called watch this

289
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:08,720
not that where he plays a game that he

290
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,039
normally plays on his podcast for free

291
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,399
for free and it felt like I paid $5 to

292
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:15,078
download a podcast basically because I

293
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:16,919
listen to his podcast frequently and it

294
00:10:15,078 --> 00:10:19,479
didn't feel any better than that that

295
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:21,958
son of a [ __ ] turned 50 on us and all

296
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:23,959
of a sudden he became a money hungry

297
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:28,199
[ __ ] capitalist he doesn't even smoke

298
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:30,039
we this is all a a ruse oh no he is he

299
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:33,240
doesn't smoke nope

300
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:36,000
um all right so anyway about this

301
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:38,039
album yeah the album like I was saying

302
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,759
the first track is reading tweets the

303
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:42,078
second track is uh talking about

304
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:44,120
something that he normally does on his

305
00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:45,879
podcast then he actually tells a joke

306
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:47,759
and then he tells a couple more jokes

307
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:49,519
and then he promotes his other podcasts

308
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:51,958
and then he promotes another podcast and

309
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,278
then he promotes his other podcast and

310
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:55,799
then he talks about traveling and then

311
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:57,879
he actually does a really good joke it's

312
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:59,519
not a well put together album and that

313
00:10:57,879 --> 00:11:01,399
sucks because Doug's one of my favorite

314
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,240
people he's my friend I called Doug my

315
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:04,919
friend he knows who I am you know we

316
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,278
contact each other and to see one of

317
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:08,559
your friends put something out like that

318
00:11:06,278 --> 00:11:10,078
it's almost like oh man you could have

319
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:12,838
you could have done a little harder on

320
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:15,479
that most comedy albums the comedian

321
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,959
will start with a decent story and then

322
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,399
tell you a couple jokes and then by the

323
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:20,439
time you forgotten about that first

324
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,440
story he'll tell you another part that

325
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:24,440
reminds you of that that refers to that

326
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,920
to make you laugh Doug has already

327
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,560
forgotten the first part of his act by

328
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:29,039
the time he's 20 minutes in he can't do

329
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:30,159
a call back that's what I'm doing right

330
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:31,599
now

331
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:33,600
we got Clint too high today Clint got

332
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,639
himself too high sorry guys that's all

333
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,759
right this podcast sucks uh out of if

334
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:40,200
you could give uh Doug Benson's album

335
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:41,519
the podcast doesn't suck bro we're going

336
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,079
to we're going to make it Rock if you

337
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,360
could give Doug Benson's album up to

338
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:46,599
five pot leaves one a scale of one to

339
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,919
five pot leaves how many leaves you

340
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:50,759
going to give him he's going to get one

341
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:52,719
pot leaf he's going to get one pot leaf

342
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:54,120
so I'll give him two uh maybe two and a

343
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,800
half or three but it definitely was not

344
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:58,039
a four or five star performance yeah

345
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:00,439
he's your friend and I think you're

346
00:11:58,039 --> 00:12:02,319
being generous

347
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03,680
I think I'm being mean too but there's

348
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,399
just so

349
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:09,638

350
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:12,759
much to do out there now like I could

351
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:17,079

352
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:19,159
that that album right there is my only

353
00:12:17,078 --> 00:12:21,559
introduction to Dun Doug

354
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:24,480
Benson that's the only thing I know of

355
00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:27,919
him other than his podcast yeah so I am

could take but I'll be there Doug don't

381
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:15,759
worry I just wasn't uh I like the way

382
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:17,240
that uh PS put together a comedy album I

383
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:22,278
like the way Ari put together a comedy

384
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:23,839
album it's got more uh uh continuity is

385
00:13:22,278 --> 00:13:25,679
the word I'm looking for it flows a

386
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,160
little bit better yeah just and I I'd

387
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:28,879
prefer that out of a comedy album did

388
00:13:27,159 --> 00:13:30,838
you watch that Bill Burr album you know

389
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:33,399
I did did see that one uh the black and

390
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:35,399
white one what's it called uh [ __ ] I

391
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:36,919
don't remember now but that was that was

392
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:38,879
great yeah that's what I expect out of a

393
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:40,639
comedy album that's a little bit better

394
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:42,958
that's that's hard to be like all right

395
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:45,600
well here's here's this guy who's

396
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:49,198
perfect at this like that's Bill bir of

397
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:51,680
me he's perfect at it he's he works so

398
00:13:49,198 --> 00:13:53,958
hard at it and it's so exciting to watch

399
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:56,399
somebody be perfect at something Anthony

400
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:59,879
jelnick is damn near perfect at see it's

401
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:01,519
just I think that jelnick

402
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:05,399
has his

403
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:08,759
routine but Bill Burr could just go off

404
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:11,240
on anything okay it's [ __ ] lovely

405
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:14,360
it's so beautiful to watch and so most

406
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:16,399
of those bits that he has he's kind of

407
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:18,600
half improvising as he's telling the

408
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,480
joke he knows how long and what beats he

409
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:23,320
wants to hit but it's not like that

410
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,959
regimented I say it like this jezl neck

411
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:27,079
kind of way yeah and jezel neck is kind

412
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:30,078
of a robot in that that well you've said

413
00:14:27,078 --> 00:14:32,239
it plenty of times like he counts yeah

414
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:33,559
counts I can see his throat moving when

415
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,320
he counts yeah I can see him say the

416
00:14:33,559 --> 00:14:38,439
word 11 yeah yeah but that's that's what

417
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,199
I'm saying is like he uh Bill ber can go

418
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:42,120
in there and do his routine and then

419
00:14:40,198 --> 00:14:43,958
break away and do some dance moves and

420
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:46,078
then go back to the routine yeah and I

421
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:48,239
love that about a comedian poops has

422
00:14:46,078 --> 00:14:50,799

rambly but that's all right Clint's

434
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,160
coming back around I could feel him

435

connecting a little more yeah the uh the

436
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:14,838

in [ __ ] dude see you're getting almost

445
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:33,559
funny that was

446
00:15:31,318 --> 00:15:34,799
pretty no it was good I I almost tried

447
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:37,278
to talk over it then I was like we got

448
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:39,958
to give him credit for that

449
00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:42,559
one somebody sent me a Facebook message

450
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:45,119
and it was uh a good question for Clint

451
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:49,039
because they said uh how much should I

452
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:51,039
be smoking oh yeah one one yeah today

453
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:54,120
Clint should have only taken one yeah it

454
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:56,439
seems like it that's I can't that's the

455
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:58,720
beauty of cannabis if you're using

456
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:00,480
medical marijuana the beauty of it is

457
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,240
that it's up to you that's why you have

458
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,839
chosen to medicate yourself with medical

459
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,278
marijuana because some doctor isn't

460
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:09,920
saying take two of these every so often

461
00:16:06,278 --> 00:16:11,600
it's up to you to figure out how many

462
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:14,240
puffs off of this bowl or how much of

463
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:16,440
this joint I need to smoke to ease my

464
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,440
medical condition and then you want to

465
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:20,079
you're going to have to I guess if

466
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,000
you've never smoked light up a joint and

467
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:23,120
take two

468
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,639
Puffs and then see how that does if

469
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,480
that's way too much next time only take

470
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,440
one if that didn't do it take three next

471
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:31,680
time make a smaller joint yeah roll a

472
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:33,560
smaller joint and don't get as high but

473
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:36,000
it's hard for me to tell you how much

474
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:37,838
you should be smoking because we I just

475
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,198
watch Clint take three hits off of a

476
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:43,800
bowl of some pretty high grade Sour

477
00:16:40,198 --> 00:16:46,318
Diesel and he is high and Jeff took two

478
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:48,359
I took two and then two [ __ ] dabs and

479
00:16:46,318 --> 00:16:51,240
I'm about to take another dab like

480
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:53,278
[ __ ] dabs well I know dab dabs are my

481
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:55,680
friend Clint says dabs are drugs drugs

482
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:57,720
and I could see why he says that but

483
00:16:55,679 --> 00:17:00,519
it's all about what you need are you

484
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:03,000
smoking to medicate yourself uh are if

485
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:05,640
you're smoking to prevent seizures uh

486
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,640
smoke as much as you want smoke all day

487
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:10,439
like there well it's it's it really just

488
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:12,199
smoke until you're comfortable yeah as

489
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:14,720
long as you're smoking isn't hindering

490
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:16,480
your ability to be a productive person

491
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,959
as long as it's not causing you a

492
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:21,439
financial problem a health problem a

493
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:24,720
mental problem a motivational problem a

494
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:26,839
relationship problem for sure uh if as

495
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:30,038
long as you're not using it as a crutch

496
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:31,918
as long as it's not an anchor or

497
00:17:30,038 --> 00:17:33,839
something negative as long as it's not

498
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:36,280
causing a problem is my point here smoke

499
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:38,199
as much as you feel comfortable with I

500
00:17:36,279 --> 00:17:39,759
don't recommend every day trying to see

501
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,600
how high you can get you don't need to

502
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:43,519
be Joey Diaz and try to see the [ __ ]

503
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:46,038
devil every day I don't know why people

504
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:48,319
want to do that but try it once you know

505
00:17:46,038 --> 00:17:50,440
why not I didn't just push the limit

506
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:52,200
nope okay and if you don't want well

507
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,440
that's the thing because I'm comfortable

508
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,679
you kind of are pushing the that third

509
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,480
one was your limit you're kind of

510
00:17:54,679 --> 00:17:58,960
pushing it now okay that was okay yeah

511
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,400

641
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:23,079
you blew it off for too long so support

642
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:24,839
the local comedy uh as to how much you

643

or two by myself like started a fresh

650

started another gram and finished that

652
00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:44,720
one by myself through that throughout a

653
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:46,000
course of a day and you would think

654
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,440
those are days when I'm sitting around

655
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
not doing [ __ ] but those are actually

656
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:52,000
the days when I'm doing the most yeah I

657
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,919
don't know how I do it but I'll stop and

658
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,759
take four or five fat dabs and go right

659
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:57,600
back to work work for an hour or two

660
00:22:55,759 --> 00:23:00,000

663
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:06,879
doesn't stick around as much well at

664
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:08,000
least like you're using it though you

665
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,480
know how at the end of the day your back

666
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
hurts and you're all sore if you've been

667
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,759

00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:17,918
relaxed I'm like I guess it's like going

671
00:23:16,119 --> 00:23:20,199

so I ate a doughnut earlier and

689
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:54,679
apparently part of the frosting was

690
00:23:53,079 --> 00:23:57,000
stuck to my arm hair and when I pulled

691
00:23:54,679 --> 00:23:58,840
on it it really hurt oh my God you're

692
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,278
such a wuss well you pull on your arm

693
00:23:58,839 --> 00:24:04,158
hair bro pull some of that [ __ ] out yeah

694
00:24:01,278 --> 00:24:06,880
it's not a thing you're cooler than

695
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:09,120
me anyway I'm just so high couldn't feel

696
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:12,278
my arm like P had a donut frosting

697
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:14,879
dingleberry in my arm hair I like I like

698
00:24:12,278 --> 00:24:16,720
that I like dut frosting dingleberry in

699
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,520
my arm hair because no just I just like

700
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:22,200
the dut frosting dingleberry I like that

701
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:26,240
I don't know why all I hope that you uh

702
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:26,240
consider that for the name of this uh

703
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:31,879
episode nobody will listen if we do that

704
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:33,000
I warned them I warned them immediately

705
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:35,919
when they were coming on if they're

706
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:38,599
still with us yeah you guys are soldiers

707
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:41,440
now let Soldier on what else do we got

708
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:43,359
all right so holy crap uh guys don't

709
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,240
smoke as much as Clint did but smoke as

710
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:46,519
much as I did and that's that's funny

711
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:48,839
because that's a good example I have

712
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:51,119
probably consumed uh since Clint's been

713
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:53,079
here five dabs I'm going to guess F four

714
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:56,319
or five Dabs at least since Clint's been

715
00:24:53,079 --> 00:24:57,519
here four two Puffs off of that bowl and

716
00:24:56,319 --> 00:24:59,558
of course I've been smoking throughout

717
00:24:57,519 --> 00:25:02,079
the day you know it's 7:00 almost so

718
00:24:59,558 --> 00:25:04,720
I've probably had 12 dabs by now today

719
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:06,720
oh and I smoked uh nothing all day today

720
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,798
and Clint is ruined I'm not going to let

721
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:11,839
Clint drive for at least another hour oh

722
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:13,720
for sure and uh I could pass any

723
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:15,278
sobriety test that you needed me to

724
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:18,360
right now yeah yeah like I'm not even

725
00:25:15,278 --> 00:25:20,440
being a smartass I am going to burp but

726
00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:22,240
I really could pass almost any sobriety

727
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:24,440
test you offered me at this point yeah

728
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,798
yeah it's all about your body chemistry

729
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,278
uh where you're used to being where

730
00:25:25,798 --> 00:25:29,720
you're trying to be with how long your

731
00:25:27,278 --> 00:25:31,079
dreadlocks are your dreadlocks are now

732
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:32,319
it's funny dude cuz I've seen some

733
00:25:31,079 --> 00:25:33,759
people with dreads trying to be cool and

734
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:34,639
they can't keep up at all they think

735
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:36,398
that because they got the dreads they're

736
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,600
going to be able to party with me like

737
00:25:36,398 --> 00:25:40,639
take a half gr Dad let's see who you are

738
00:25:38,599 --> 00:25:42,599
you got to carry him to the couch yeah

739
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,080
all right somebody as me pull him by his

740
00:25:42,599 --> 00:25:45,480
dread drag him by the dreads right to

741
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:48,759
the couch drag them out in the front

742
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:50,679
yard the spr somebody also sent me a

743
00:25:48,759 --> 00:25:53,319
message about trim machines they said

744
00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:54,480
how do you feel about trim machines uh

745
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:56,079
honestly you're going to think I'm a

746
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,480
prick but [ __ ] a trim machine a trim

747
00:25:56,079 --> 00:26:01,879
machine ruins your trim uh it chops up

748
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:04,798
it makes a Messier buds uh high-grade

749
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:07,600
topshelf cannabis is hand trimmed uh

750
00:26:04,798 --> 00:26:10,599
trim machines don't have fingers or eyes

751
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:11,918
they don't care they don't put in love

752
00:26:10,599 --> 00:26:13,678
uh they mangle the buds I think if

753
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:15,520
you've got a nice bud and you run it

754
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:17,240
through a trim machine it's not going to

755
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:18,720
take off all the leaf in one spot and it

756
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:20,079
will take off some of the bud in some

757
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,558
spot and this is from experience I've

758
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:24,119
helped other people use trim machines we

759
00:26:21,558 --> 00:26:26,440
use the spin Pro I've seen the uh the

760
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:28,678
Grim or the trim Reaper I've seen the

761
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:31,200
tsunami thing I don't like the way any

762
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:34,679
of them work also what it does is it

763
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:36,720
turns your trim into a mulch it chops it

764
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:39,679
up into this really funky Mulch and then

765
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:42,880
it almost creates too many Cuts so that

766
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:45,440
the moisture seeps out of the leave the

767
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,960
leaves or the trim in a weird way and it

768
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,600
doesn't it'll it'll mold up there's

769
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:52,319
almost no way to prevent that [ __ ] from

770
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:54,558
turning moldy so I like to hand trim

771
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:56,558
that way you can separate the big leaves

772
00:26:54,558 --> 00:26:58,599
from the good trim and you can know what

773
00:26:56,558 --> 00:27:01,798
you're making hash with and nobody's

774
00:26:58,599 --> 00:27:03,839
gonna trim it like a person like uh at

775
00:27:01,798 --> 00:27:05,359
the dispensaries they've got a whole

776
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:07,599
crew of trimmers that hand trim

777
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:09,158
everything and they don't go as quickly

778
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:11,199
as a trimmer but I think it's well worth

779
00:27:09,159 --> 00:27:13,919
it you can see the difference uh it's a

780
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,640
whole bunch of like 22 to 28 year old

781
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:17,038
people that just want to trim all day

782
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:18,640
they're eager to get into the Cannabis

783
00:27:17,038 --> 00:27:20,240
business and they just want to trim so

784
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,799
they just kickass all day in hopes of

785
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:24,240
getting promoted to a bud tender or a

786
00:27:21,798 --> 00:27:26,038
grower and that's who does the trimming

787
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,558
uh I'd rather have those six or eight

788
00:27:26,038 --> 00:27:30,038
people sitting around trimming all day

789
00:27:27,558 --> 00:27:33,359
every day than two trim machines running

790
00:27:30,038 --> 00:27:35,798
honestly yeah so uh [ __ ] auto trimmer

791
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:38,079
[ __ ] a trim machine trim it by hand yeah

792
00:27:35,798 --> 00:27:40,599
use some scissors use your eyes I don't

793
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:42,558

probably trimmed 100 pounds of weed I

799
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,480
don't know more than 100 pounds of weed

800
00:27:54,038 --> 00:27:58,319
in my life I'm pretty sure I've trimmed

801
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:59,720
more than 100 pounds by myself um so

802
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:01,639
there was a second half to that question

803
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:03,038
that somebody emailed to me uh the

804
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:04,399
second half of that question is kind of

805
00:28:03,038 --> 00:28:05,919
lengthy and I'm going to have to do some

806
00:28:04,398 --> 00:28:08,158
research and give you a more thought out

807
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:10,159
answer for that I did not prepare enough

808
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:11,919
time for that answer it's a really good

809
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:13,600
question and I will get back to you I'm

810
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:15,159
not blowing it off that's just I want to

811
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:17,319
be accurate in a little more in depth

812
00:28:15,159 --> 00:28:19,919
for you because that is a hell of a good

813
00:28:17,319 --> 00:28:22,519

old cat he loves to tell me stories bro

827

and you know what I had him on the

828
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:54,798
podcast one time on 719 the blocks and I

829
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:56,240
remember that when we put on the

830
00:28:54,798 --> 00:28:57,720
headphones on him and put the microphone

831
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,558
in front of him something lit up inside

832
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:00,440
of him

833
00:28:58,558 --> 00:29:03,319
and his voice turned into like this and

834
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:04,240
he got all spectacular and charismatic

835
00:29:03,319 --> 00:29:05,439
and at the end of the show I was like

836
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,120

837
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:09,798

digital College radio now this is weird

842
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:19,759
and then we got our like cult little

843
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,480

to say thank you because I haven't said

870
00:30:06,599 --> 00:30:10,079
that enough lately I've been caught up

871
00:30:08,359 --> 00:30:11,519
in putting out a show and keeping the

872
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:13,678
guest entertained and keeping the flow

873
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:15,519
happening to haven't uh sincerely said

874
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:18,559
holy [ __ ] thank you guys we get so many

875
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:20,839
downloads so many listens uh the website

876
00:30:18,558 --> 00:30:22,240
traffic I had to pay for more bandwidth

877
00:30:20,839 --> 00:30:24,519
on my website because you guys are

878
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:26,038
killing it downloading episodes damn bro

879
00:30:24,519 --> 00:30:28,278
uh the traffic on the website is

880
00:30:26,038 --> 00:30:30,599
exploding uh it's going nuts we had to

881
00:30:28,278 --> 00:30:32,880
fix uh the file type that I upload so

882
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:34,439
that it's more available for Stitcher uh

883
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,080
because people were downloading it so

884
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:38,038
much that it was slowing down the

885
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:39,918
stitcher application on their phone oh

886
00:30:38,038 --> 00:30:41,200
[ __ ] so I change the file the type the

887
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:42,960
type of file that I upload it's a little

888
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,399
smaller it doesn't sound as good but

889
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,038
nobody's probably going to notice it's

890
00:30:44,398 --> 00:30:47,879
just a voice podcast it's not like we're

891
00:30:46,038 --> 00:30:50,200
putting out freaking dance music or

892
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:51,720
anything so but yeah people are

893
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:53,880
listening and I really really appreciate

894
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:56,038

912
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:33,840

919
00:31:44,038 --> 00:31:47,158

922
00:31:48,599 --> 00:31:53,480

923
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:54,638

924
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:56,759
that I want to talk about on today's

925
00:31:54,638 --> 00:31:58,319
episode I think we can almost uh if you

926
00:31:56,759 --> 00:31:59,720
want to [ __ ] ramble on about

927
00:31:58,319 --> 00:32:01,398
something for a couple of minutes man

928
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:03,639
what's your uh how long how long have we

929
00:32:01,398 --> 00:32:05,599
done now we've gone 33 minutes but I

930
00:32:03,638 --> 00:32:07,558
imagine that 1 to 3 minutes will be

931
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:09,240
taken out so we got about 30 minutes of

932
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:10,960
usable material here Jesus there was a

933
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:13,120
there was a depressing part in there too

934
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:15,000
I hope that does not make the podcast

935
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:16,398
Jesus I'll make you look dignified

936
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,798
before this comes out that'd be really

937
00:32:16,398 --> 00:32:19,759

attention to the chat in Periscope I

1078
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:58,760

1083
00:37:03,838 --> 00:37:08,199
screen I will read the question loud

1084
00:37:06,159 --> 00:37:09,799

1085

1092
00:37:19,838 --> 00:37:26,519
Troll game I am troll proof on Periscope

[ __ ] make me cry it's interet well

1096
00:37:30,838 --> 00:37:35,000

00:37:32,318 --> 00:37:36,400
original anymore that's the truth I mean

1098

about comedy too CU there's a lot of

1101
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:45,480

know we're just trying to do new stuff

1103
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:49,920
that's all it is but troll proof is

1104
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:51,598
[ __ ] awesome troll proof that should

1105
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:52,800
I should make a screen name or something

1106
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:55,480

1150
00:39:16,039 --> 00:39:19,679
a reason that's what I believe that's

1151
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,800
the damn truth you guys all right we're

1152
00:39:19,679 --> 00:39:23,039
going to wrap up this show we've been

1153

1156
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:33,358
he G you all got the warning at the same

1157
00:39:30,358 --> 00:39:35,440
time Jeff got the frontt to this one cuz

1158
00:39:33,358 --> 00:39:36,799
you guys had the opportunity to not

1159
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,280
listen to this and I'm going to edit

1160
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,720
some of this out so oh he's going to

1161
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:42,240
have to listen to this again twice twice

1162
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:43,559
because I'll listen to it as I edit it

1163
00:39:42,239 --> 00:39:45,639
and then when it's complete I'll give it

1164

1278
00:43:27,358 --> 00:43:31,519
and pick apart my brain just to see if

1279
00:43:29,559 --> 00:43:33,200
any little piece of art remains it's

1280
00:43:31,519 --> 00:43:35,119
hard to change cuz I'm getting used to

1281
00:43:33,199 --> 00:43:37,318
routine these days are all the same

1282
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:39,599
wearing like my blue jeans I got a few

1283
00:43:37,318 --> 00:43:41,440
sches but I ain't made a rich sometimes

1284
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:43,640
my mood swings sometimes I hate the

1285
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:46,720
[ __ ] too many Lost Dreams none of my

1286
00:43:43,639 --> 00:43:48,920
plans met 26 and I don't feel like a man

1287
00:43:46,719 --> 00:43:50,759
yet I can't sweat it all the time cuz it

1288
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:52,920
makes me sink sometimes I hate to think

1289
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:55,200
it's just another page of a still scared

1290
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:56,800
to fly sitting in my bird's nest never

1291
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:59,679
dead to try but the sky is where you're

1292
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:01,760
h best I deserve less I never thought

1293
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:03,440
I'd say it but too many people in my

1294
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:05,440
life have bought and paid it often

1295
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:07,400
waited for a hand out to come to me

1296
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:09,720
thought I had my plans now mapped out

1297
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:11,599
comfortably getting older now that isn't

1298
00:44:09,719 --> 00:44:13,679
who I want to be looking in the mirror

1299
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:15,318
I'm unaware of what's in front of me I

1300
00:44:13,679 --> 00:44:17,318
got a ton to see and I ain't getting

1301
00:44:15,318 --> 00:44:19,800
younger deciding not to jump was my

1302
00:44:17,318 --> 00:44:21,519
biggest blunder I sit and wonder about

1303
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:23,640
what could have been and instead of

1304
00:44:21,519 --> 00:44:25,880

1314

above the surface everything I see keeps

1315
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:52,199
changing afraid of the day life sweeps
