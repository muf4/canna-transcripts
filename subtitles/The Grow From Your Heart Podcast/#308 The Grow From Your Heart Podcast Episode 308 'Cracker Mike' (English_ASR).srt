feel like I've been yelling and

40
00:01:19,978 --> 00:01:23,489
screaming but it's just from the dads

41
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:26,219
and all the flowers that I smoke I don't

43
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:29,759
feeling a little half human half jerky

a little jerky huh

46
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,770
I've been on since the dude grows Cup

47
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:37,439
last week I've been smoking heavy I

48
00:01:34,769 --> 00:01:40,920
haven't stopped since then luckily we

49
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:42,780
have cool employment so at 4:20 on 4/20

50
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,700
we were able to take some 420 smoke egde

51
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:47,099
yeah I just rearranged our break

52
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,810
schedule that was pretty nice that was

53
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:51,658
the beginning of a smoke-filled weekend

54
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:54,600
I haven't stopped I went I went to the

55
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:56,399
dispensary on sometime last week

56
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:58,649
Wednesday I think yeah went last

57
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,689
Wednesday and I bought hash about

58
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:04,140
concentrates for the rest of the week

59
00:02:00,688 --> 00:02:07,589
plus I bought a stash for 4/20 I burned

60
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:08,819
bright of course my throat is shot on

61
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:11,250
that I burnt right through that it's

62
00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:12,659
gone I had to go shopping again today we

63
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:14,939
just got back from the dispensary just a

64
00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:16,500
little bit ago so that's a great segue I

65
00:02:14,939 --> 00:02:18,629
like to start the podcast off by letting

66
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,859
you guys know what I'm smoking today

67
00:02:18,629 --> 00:02:21,060
that's gonna be a challenge because I

68
00:02:19,859 --> 00:02:22,560
just got back from the dispensary and I

69
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:26,219
think we've taken a dab of almost

70
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:29,099
everything we bought I've got some Mendo

71
00:02:26,219 --> 00:02:32,099
breath and broza which tastes phenomenal

72
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:33,659
it is set me back in my seat we haven't

73
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:37,108
tried that one I haven't tried that one

74
00:02:33,659 --> 00:02:38,789
this is our Pez ambrosia uh super-sweet

75
00:02:37,109 --> 00:02:41,820
pezzi candy kind of a grapefruit

76
00:02:38,789 --> 00:02:44,669
with a cherry aftertaste be Clement I uh

77
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:47,389
the Clementine tastes amazing doesn't

78
00:02:44,669 --> 00:02:49,798
get me high but the Clement eye

79
00:02:47,389 --> 00:02:50,518
Clementine and Clement eye or two

80
00:02:49,799 --> 00:02:52,159
different things

81
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:54,299
the Clement eye has that Clementine

82
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:55,919
deliciousness but it's also got another

83
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:57,930
thing in there that does get me high so

84
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:59,969
that's beautiful then the one that

85
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:01,409
[ __ ] me up the one that made me want

86
00:02:59,969 --> 00:03:02,759
to just go lay down on the couch or

87
00:03:01,408 --> 00:03:04,709
maybe even on the floor might have been

88
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:08,069
okay was the

89
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:10,469
the louis xiii ah this battery will do

90
00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:11,849
the dude I took that Dad and I was

91
00:03:10,469 --> 00:03:13,069
talking and in the middle of my sense I

92
00:03:11,849 --> 00:03:17,699
was like brother lately

93
00:03:13,069 --> 00:03:19,379
whoa did I melt him I done like I felt

94
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:21,060
that like that girl in the on the couch

95
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:24,509
and the [ __ ] old commercial they just

96
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:26,449
melted that's what it did to me yes I

97
00:03:24,509 --> 00:03:29,189
finally found that weed that did that

98
00:03:26,449 --> 00:03:31,709
unless you got me to lit so uh yeah the

99
00:03:29,189 --> 00:03:34,349
King Louie the thirteen batter from

100
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:36,840
apothecary farms that stuff was awesome

101
00:03:34,349 --> 00:03:39,060
I liked the flavor of the Mendo breath

102
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:41,729
better but the high on the Louie was

103
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:42,990
pretty phenomenal then ladies and

104
00:03:41,729 --> 00:03:44,869
gentlemen if you listen to the podcast

105
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:49,520
often you've heard me talk about the

106
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:51,870
Starchild og that I got from a cut above

111
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:02,129
Mike and I have been over indulging on

112
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:07,170
this it's wonderful would you agree with

113
00:04:02,129 --> 00:04:11,699
the citrus dryer sheett sandalwood

114
00:04:07,169 --> 00:04:13,799
peppermint flavor yeah okay this hint of

115
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:16,379
peppermint no it's a lot it's got that

116
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:21,600
candle store kind of yeah that's a lot

117
00:04:16,379 --> 00:04:23,969
of sense and flavors all at once but the

118
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,520
dryer sheet in the candy were out front

119
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:27,990
yes yes and that dryer sheet thing that

120
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:30,689
it leaves on your mouth that cottonmouth

121
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:33,240
flavor I I enjoy that flavor that dryer

122
00:04:30,689 --> 00:04:34,620
sheet that's uh Turpin alene is what I

123
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,689
think that terpenoid is that gives you

124
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:38,790
that flavor I really enjoy that it comes

125
00:04:36,689 --> 00:04:41,579
in you find that in Jack Herer a lot you

126
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:43,050
find that in the trainwreck I guess cuz

127
00:04:41,579 --> 00:04:44,159
that's what this Cross has trainwreck in

128
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:47,189
it that's probably where that came from

129
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,490
I love it great flavor we haven't tried

130
00:04:47,189 --> 00:04:53,879
it yet but I've also got some of the

131
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:56,100
Green Dot labs black label white Durbin

132
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:58,560
nectar this is the white crusted urban

133
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:00,360
poison I'm excited to try this one a

134
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,920
little bigger I just know so many things

135
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,810
that I had to save one for later

136
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:06,150
that Green Dot is kind of the the fancy

137
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:07,889
one we wanted to do a slightly more

138
00:05:06,149 --> 00:05:10,979
coherent show so we slowed our roll a

139
00:05:07,889 --> 00:05:12,629
little bit I just a little the Green Dot

140
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:15,240
is a great product it's worth the money

141
00:05:12,629 --> 00:05:17,159
but I prefer a different consistency and

142
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,329
everything was on sale for 4/20 so I

143
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:21,030
grabbed some of the Green Dot

144
00:05:18,329 --> 00:05:23,639
label it's gonna be like my uh my secret

145
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:25,168
stash my spoil myself stash the after

146
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:26,340
podcast dabs when you want to get a

147
00:05:25,168 --> 00:05:28,019
little goofy and not have to pay

148
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:30,119
attention to anything right so that's

149
00:05:28,019 --> 00:05:31,889
what we're smoking on today Mike really

150
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,899
seemed to like the sour Pez when I gave

151
00:05:31,889 --> 00:05:36,180
him a dab of that I was really nice but

152
00:05:33,899 --> 00:05:37,679
then the which one was it that really

153
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:39,569
made you choke up a lot of the mindo

154
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,250
breath was definitely the other Mendo

155
00:05:39,569 --> 00:05:42,750
breath was a cougher yeah that one made

156
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:44,339
you choke up a whole bunch but I think

157
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:46,829
everybody enjoyed all the dads so great

158
00:05:44,339 --> 00:05:49,649
work to a cut above and green dot and

159

can't

209
00:07:25,769 --> 00:07:30,478
Early's way easier to fix them too late

210
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:32,128
that's the truth I can't wait they won't

211
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:33,538
let me pay for it because I'm not

212
00:07:32,129 --> 00:07:34,979
thirty days within the expiration date

213
00:07:33,538 --> 00:07:36,509
yet so I've got to wait a couple of days

214
00:07:34,978 --> 00:07:37,618
here before I could pay for it

215
00:07:36,509 --> 00:07:39,239
would you that's fine with me I'm

216
00:07:37,619 --> 00:07:42,149
getting I'm buying I'm on free time

217
00:07:39,238 --> 00:07:43,768
right now but uh so the hardest part

218
00:07:42,149 --> 00:07:45,598
about getting my weed card renewed was

219
00:07:43,769 --> 00:07:47,338
getting the [ __ ] appointment yep I

220
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:48,868
had to call several times and they kept

221
00:07:47,338 --> 00:07:50,550
saying we're booked and I was like well

222
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:51,599
what the [ __ ] like we're booked and I

223
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:53,519
was like can you just give me a date

224
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:56,218
further out and they're like no what

225
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:59,519
happened was the main weed doctor for my

226
00:07:56,218 --> 00:08:00,808
area has retired the guy that Mike and I

227
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:02,879
go to can I say his name is that fair

228
00:08:00,809 --> 00:08:04,559
yeah do you do that dr. Bruce rhymers

229
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,269
has done he's retired from the cannabis

230
00:08:04,559 --> 00:08:08,009
industry he's not writing marijuana

231
00:08:06,269 --> 00:08:10,348
cards anymore doesn't surprise me he's

232
00:08:08,009 --> 00:08:12,629
been doing it for a minute for at least

233
00:08:10,348 --> 00:08:18,300
five or six years that I've gone to him

234
00:08:12,629 --> 00:08:20,789
we we yeah so he's made plenty of money

235
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:22,348
he's retired but there was a new doctor

236
00:08:20,788 --> 00:08:24,269
there and I had to kind of reintroduce

237
00:08:22,348 --> 00:08:25,558
myself and meet the new doctor but the

238
00:08:24,269 --> 00:08:27,179
hardest part so the hardest part was

239
00:08:25,559 --> 00:08:29,879
getting the appointment then they said

240
00:08:27,178 --> 00:08:30,508
we've got this day at this time and I

241
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:32,759
was like what are my other options

242
00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:35,068

245
00:08:36,418 --> 00:08:41,788

246
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:42,990
[ __ ] okay so we go there and I didn't

247
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:44,188
get stuck in the elevator this time the

248
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:45,480
last time I went to that building the L

249
00:08:44,188 --> 00:08:46,708
I got stuck in the elevator and they

250
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,449
almost canceled my appointment because I

251
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:49,619
was 20 minutes late I called them I was

252
00:08:48,448 --> 00:08:50,338
like hey I'm stuck in your elevator and

253
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,899

254
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:53,100
appointment and I was like no I'm Steve

257
00:08:54,389 --> 00:08:57,209
what to do just don't miss your

258
00:08:55,438 --> 00:08:58,438
appointment and I kind of threw a fit

259
00:08:57,208 --> 00:09:00,599
when I got in the office I was like hey

260
00:08:58,438 --> 00:09:02,399
yeah I was stuck in the elevator like

261
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,050
you should feel bad for me like you

262
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,389
shouldn't just [ __ ] my appointment I was

263
00:09:04,049 --> 00:09:07,859
here like I was trapped like I could I

264
00:09:06,389 --> 00:09:09,509
wasn't just drinking off in the basement

265
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:11,579
I was stuck so you let me have my

266
00:09:09,509 --> 00:09:13,169
appointment but this time there they

267
00:09:11,578 --> 00:09:15,149
said it's gonna be a minute because the

268
00:09:13,169 --> 00:09:16,979
the state is updating their computer

269
00:09:15,149 --> 00:09:18,929
system we're no longer gonna have these

270
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:20,938
cards that we print it's going to be

271
00:09:18,929 --> 00:09:22,078
attached to the barcode on your ID so

272
00:09:20,938 --> 00:09:23,818
you're no longer than I have to present

273
00:09:22,078 --> 00:09:25,559
a card you'll just walk in with your

274
00:09:23,818 --> 00:09:27,120
Colorado ID they will swipe that just

275
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:28,258
like they do at the bar it'll show that

276
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,750
you're old enough that you're a patient

277
00:09:28,259 --> 00:09:32,068
and it'll let you in so the day that I

278
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:34,049
went was the first day they were

279
00:09:32,068 --> 00:09:35,519
activating this new system which meant

280
00:09:34,049 --> 00:09:38,099
the computer was all [ __ ] up and

281
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:41,339
everything was taken for you so my visit

282
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:43,500
I sat in line for at least an hour maybe

283
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:45,209
two I just playing with my phone

284
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,019
chillin they have you fill out the

285
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:48,028
little application

286
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:49,350
stuff online I just hit refresh because

287
00:09:48,028 --> 00:09:51,208
mine I'd already been all filled out

288
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:54,119
before all my information is still the

289
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:55,528
same refilled everything out then the

290
00:09:54,119 --> 00:09:56,759
doctor came and explained what happened

291
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:58,708
to Bruce he's like yeah he's been in the

292
00:09:56,759 --> 00:10:00,119
weed industry since the 70s he was like

293
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:02,159
a big part of legalization where he's

294
00:10:00,119 --> 00:10:03,629
from and he did all this and he's like

295
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:05,818
but he retired so I'm the new doctor my

296
00:10:03,629 --> 00:10:07,289
name is this how many times have you

297
00:10:05,818 --> 00:10:09,568
seen dr. rhymers and I said this is

298
00:10:07,289 --> 00:10:11,578
probably my seventh or eighth time with

299
00:10:09,568 --> 00:10:14,009
medical alternatives renewing my card

300
00:10:11,578 --> 00:10:14,338
and he goes oh okay just signed for my

301
00:10:14,009 --> 00:10:15,959
paper

302
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:17,730
she's like there you go here's your new

303
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:19,138
renewal and that was pretty much all it

304
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:20,519
took and he said this is gonna take 24

305
00:10:19,139 --> 00:10:22,409
hours to update because the website is

306
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:23,610
down but check this in 24 hours make

307
00:10:22,409 --> 00:10:26,730
sure all your information is cool and

308
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:27,839
you'll be legit and so [ __ ] went

309
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:29,278

310
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,170

316
00:10:38,249 --> 00:10:41,939
print off a new card but it won't let me

317
00:10:40,289 --> 00:10:43,860
pay for anything yet I've gotta wait I

318

325
00:10:56,610 --> 00:11:00,240
times yeah the doctor's appointment and

326
00:10:58,318 --> 00:11:02,009
then back in the day you would get your

327
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,539
card renewal and then have to mail it in

328
00:11:02,009 --> 00:11:05,459
and then they'd have to review it and

329
00:11:03,539 --> 00:11:06,990
send it back to you and that could take

330
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:08,969
six to eight weeks and if there was a

331
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:11,938
problem with it now you're looking at

332
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:14,160
another three to five more weeks and so

333
00:11:11,938 --> 00:11:15,808
it's taking you 13 weeks 14 16 weeks

334
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:17,068
just to get your card and then you

335
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:18,868
couldn't shop you wouldn't be able to go

336
00:11:17,068 --> 00:11:20,458
to the dispensary yo and I go through a

337
00:11:18,869 --> 00:11:21,660
little bit of concentrate to where if I

338
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:23,578
couldn't shop at a medical dispensary

339
00:11:21,659 --> 00:11:25,528
would probably put me in a pinch so I've

340
00:11:23,578 --> 00:11:27,388
got to stay on top of that I've got to

341
00:11:25,528 --> 00:11:29,458
stay on top of that yeah I got ahead of

342
00:11:27,389 --> 00:11:31,198
it especially being in the industry

343
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:33,149
those are something that I always stay

344
00:11:31,198 --> 00:11:34,409
on top of his my my weed car to my badge

345
00:11:33,149 --> 00:11:35,759
stuff like that

346
00:11:34,409 --> 00:11:39,808
gotta stay on top of that so I got the

347
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:42,298
weed part of a super easy um they do not

348
00:11:39,808 --> 00:11:44,789
do extended plant counts like they used

349
00:11:42,298 --> 00:11:46,438
to do back in the day you could say I

350
00:11:44,789 --> 00:11:48,118
need an extended plant count and they

351
00:11:46,438 --> 00:11:50,219
would say what hurts and you'd say I

352
00:11:48,119 --> 00:11:52,589
don't know what does 250 bucks worth of

353
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:54,928
pain look like what is [ __ ] 24 plants

354
00:11:52,589 --> 00:11:55,529
cost and they would say okay well then

355
00:11:54,928 --> 00:11:57,659
there you go

356
00:11:55,528 --> 00:11:58,918
here's [ __ ] money here's plant count

357
00:11:57,659 --> 00:11:59,579
I'm gonna write this down on your

358
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:02,850
paperwork

359
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:04,710

360
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:06,300
it used to be Mike we're not gonna play

361
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:07,530
games cuz it's not like that anymore so

362
00:12:06,299 --> 00:12:09,389
it doesn't matter there were a lot of

363
00:12:07,529 --> 00:12:10,409
doctors [ __ ] I was trying to remember a

364
00:12:09,389 --> 00:12:11,490
doctor's name the other day and I

365
00:12:10,409 --> 00:12:13,649
couldn't remember just popped in my head

366
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:15,870
I know his [ __ ] name right now anyway

367
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:19,500
there were one a daughter walking in and

368
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:21,450
they had a it was like the drink menu at

369
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:23,700
Chili's yeah they just had a little

370
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:26,850
placard at the end of the dot on the

371
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:29,730
doctors desk that was like regular six

372
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:33,750
count ninety-nine like twelve count

373
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:35,490
I remember once 150 yup 24 catch every

374
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:37,110
hundred oh yeah it went up to five

375
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:39,720
hundred count and I was just like that

376
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:42,300
is the shadiest [ __ ] you just pay more

377
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:43,649
money you can get more

378
00:12:42,299 --> 00:12:45,479
fill out the little pain graph and we'll

379
00:12:43,649 --> 00:12:45,929
give you more plants some doctors didn't

380
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,460
give a [ __ ]

381
00:12:45,929 --> 00:12:49,349
some doctors were pretty tight on it

382
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:51,389
some doctors would not give you more

383
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:53,370
some doctors would blatantly advertise

384
00:12:51,389 --> 00:12:54,929
we'd love to give extended plant counts

385
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:56,909
they would talk about it that's not a

386
00:12:54,929 --> 00:12:59,189
know has been putting the screws the

387
00:12:56,909 --> 00:13:02,009
whole system for four years now there

388
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:03,090
are lots of new paperwork's I'm not sure

389
00:13:02,009 --> 00:13:04,919
because it was the first day of a new

390
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:07,350
system so I said lots of new paper will

391
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:10,110
also they've raised the part of missed

392
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:12,600
it I figured we would have brought up by

393
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:13,919
now but haven't touched on specifically

394
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:17,250
is it's attached to your driver's

395
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:19,979
license now so when you're asked license

396
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:21,799
registration and insurance that

397
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:24,060
information is coming up on the screen

398
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:26,219
usually you're a medical patient

399
00:13:24,059 --> 00:13:28,829
possibly is that a HIPAA violation to

400
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:30,269
put that up on the screen there's got to

401
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:32,129
be I don't I'm not worried about it

402
00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:33,870
myself but that's got a concern someone

403
00:13:32,129 --> 00:13:37,110
could be considered one the thing I

404
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:40,169
don't like about it is now that just

405
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:42,389
drastically increases the the likely so

406
00:13:40,169 --> 00:13:45,299
the cop comes up doesn't suspect a thing

407
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:47,279
the the the word marijuana never leaves

408
00:13:45,299 --> 00:13:49,500
the cops mouth doesn't smell it doesn't

409
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:52,049
see it doesn't think about it goes back

410
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:54,179
to the cruiser runs your [ __ ] come back

411
00:13:52,049 --> 00:13:56,219
up and now that's all the conversations

412
00:13:54,179 --> 00:13:58,500
about because that's what came up on

413
00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:01,889
your ID right and maybe they can turn

414
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:07,580
this from didn't signal that lane change

415
00:14:01,889 --> 00:14:10,049
or you know speeding to a DWI or DUI

416
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:11,580
that's more money for their jurisdiction

417
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:13,049
change the whole story just because it

418
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:13,370
flagged that you're a weed patient you

419
00:14:13,049 --> 00:14:17,189
know

420
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:18,810
we'll stop it uh and just a brief thing

421
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:22,980
I'd like to have faith that HIPPA

422
00:14:18,809 --> 00:14:24,329
protects me from that but but like I

423
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:26,129
said all right so there's a lot of new

424
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:27,480
paperwork lots of new questions you have

425
00:14:26,129 --> 00:14:28,919
to fill out a whole bunch of stuff it's

426
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,810
like going to a real doctor for the

427
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:32,579
first time even though I've been to that

428
00:14:30,809 --> 00:14:34,289
doctor several times or that office at

429
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:36,660
least it was like going to a whole

430
00:14:34,289 --> 00:14:38,699
brand-new doctor you have to put in to

431
00:14:36,659 --> 00:14:40,500
ask about your diet I asked about my

432
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:42,300
exercise asked about a whole bunch of

433
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:44,759
stuff so it felt a little more legit

434
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:46,500
than it did in the past there was a lot

435
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:48,149
of weird questions that I was like what

436
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:50,340
like and you glad to started making

437
00:14:48,149 --> 00:14:52,860
check marks whatever ah lots of

438
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:55,649
questions I was gonna say extended plant

439
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:58,500
counts are not gonna happen anymore you

440
00:14:55,649 --> 00:15:00,809
have to bring in actual paperwork with

441
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:02,610
your qualifying condition it has to be

442
00:15:00,809 --> 00:15:04,019
current there were people in there with

443
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:05,190
stacks of paperwork and this doctor

444
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:06,629
would not give them extended plan

445
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:08,220
accounts he's like no I'm afraid of

446
00:15:06,629 --> 00:15:09,570
those this doesn't qualify I think you

447
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:12,750
should be like cover your needs with the

448
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:14,820
plants you can grow basically it doesn't

449
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:17,759
there's no point in an extended plant

450
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:21,510
count anymore like the the state of

451
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:25,500
Colorado capped a household plant count

452
00:15:21,509 --> 00:15:28,819
at 12 yeah

453
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:32,639
state water there's a couple of specific

454
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:34,800
property zone designations for like

455
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:37,110
homesteaders like dig your own well

456
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:40,109
generate your own power raise your own

457
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:42,269
chickens type properties but the days

458
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:45,269
who can have more than more than 12 but

459
00:15:42,269 --> 00:15:47,370
the days of renting a house and throwing

460
00:15:45,269 --> 00:15:49,590
two hoop houses in the backyard and if I

461
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:51,330
can go on hog wild with $4.99 or been

462
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:55,379
over for a minute alright

463
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:58,800
yep that everybody that was doing that

464
00:15:55,379 --> 00:16:03,189
and saw it coming so the last year it

465
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:04,490
was allowed they went hog wild hog wild

466
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:09,240
[Music]

467
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:12,470
lots of negative press in industry wide

468
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:16,110
black eyes were generated and they heat

469
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:19,830
to extinguish medical from Colorado just

470
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:22,800
quadrupled so doctors are under strict

471
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:24,990
supervision card holders are under

472
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:26,759
substantial more scrutiny

473
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:28,950
it's they didn't even wanna close here

474
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:30,840
in five years always shocked they did

475
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:32,280
not want to even talk about and hear

476
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,960
about extended play no once when you'd

477
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:35,370
bring it up I didn't even say I didn't

478
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:37,590
care I was like but if you're going for

479
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:41,340
an extended planet count right now show

480
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:44,490
up with terminal illness

481
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:46,860
documentation and documentation that you

482
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:48,810
live in bfv like otherwise it ain't

483
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:50,610
happenin and otherwise it's probably

484
00:16:48,809 --> 00:16:51,419
useless because yeah would your capped

485
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:55,019
anyway yep

486
00:16:51,419 --> 00:16:57,029

not a lot of [ __ ] drama or that

532
00:18:27,299 --> 00:18:30,450
challenge answer yeah well back in the

533
00:18:29,339 --> 00:18:31,859
day it used to be different because you

534
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:33,809
have to fill out everything by hand they

535
00:18:31,859 --> 00:18:36,089
would give you a blue pan and if you sit

536
00:18:33,809 --> 00:18:37,619
for hours yeah yeah everything would

537
00:18:36,089 --> 00:18:38,639
have to yeah for four hours just to see

538
00:18:37,619 --> 00:18:40,169
the doc everything would have

539
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,550
in a blue pen and if you [ __ ] up

540
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:43,110
they'd have to give you a new paper

541
00:18:41,549 --> 00:18:45,569
because you couldn't make any

542
00:18:43,109 --> 00:18:47,849
corrections on it so you just be writing

543
00:18:45,569 --> 00:18:49,500
super carefully and then all there would

544
00:18:47,849 --> 00:18:50,939
be so many ridiculous questions and

545
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,900
there's always people that [ __ ] it up so

546
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:53,490
all the people that work there we're

547
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:55,620
tied up fixing everybody's errors all

548
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:56,849
the time used to take forever now it's

549
00:18:55,619 --> 00:18:58,799
all on a computer so you just go make a

550
00:18:56,849 --> 00:19:00,480
bunch of clicks it's pretty easy it's

551
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:02,279
pretty easy all right

552
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:05,039
one thing I want to touch on it's still

553
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:06,990
happening so I'm not positive I'm not

554
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:08,970
sure of the final outcome I don't have

555
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:10,620
any awards I don't know if anything has

556
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:14,549
happened but at the time we're recording

557
00:19:10,619 --> 00:19:16,669
this the 420 High Times Cannabis Cup

558
00:19:14,549 --> 00:19:20,069
celebration in San Bernardino is

559
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:23,100
happening yeah it is going on the reason

560
00:19:20,069 --> 00:19:24,480
that's a big deal is because Thursday

561
00:19:23,099 --> 00:19:26,339
there was an announcement made an

562
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,009
announcement made that High Times was

563
00:19:26,339 --> 00:19:33,289
denied permits for their event in San

564
00:19:29,009 --> 00:19:35,759
Bernardino the event was denied permits

565
00:19:33,289 --> 00:19:37,349
for several reasons for changes in laws

566
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:38,819
then they were saying they were going to

567
00:19:37,349 --> 00:19:40,980
let them hold the event but there would

568
00:19:38,819 --> 00:19:43,950
be no consumption because of the change

569
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:47,069
in California legalization then whoever

570
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:49,140
is in charge of running the dispensaries

571
00:19:47,069 --> 00:19:51,480
and medical marijuana centers and

572
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:54,240
marijuana centers in California issued a

573
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:58,230
statement saying that anybody attending

574
00:19:54,240 --> 00:20:01,380
this event would be under scrutiny by

575
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:03,269
that division High Times went so far as

576
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:04,950
to have security guards at every

577
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:07,289
entrance checking people and only

578
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:09,059
allowing them to bring in their a legal

579
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:11,609
allowed amount of flour so people are

580
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:13,349
only bringing in an ounce of flour or

581
00:20:11,609 --> 00:20:15,329
eight grams of concentrates or something

582
00:20:13,349 --> 00:20:17,279
like that back in the day people would

583
00:20:15,329 --> 00:20:18,569
bring in a backpack of flour and start

584
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:21,389
hustle in it people would bring in

585
00:20:18,569 --> 00:20:25,649
concentrates and sell it this time high

586
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:27,509
x was only allowing tax ID businesses to

587
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:28,950
be a part of their event so you had to

588
00:20:27,509 --> 00:20:31,589
have a real business license you have to

589
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:33,660
have a marijuana business license to set

590
00:20:31,589 --> 00:20:35,399
up so you signed up with your

591
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:37,440
application you put in your your info

592
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:39,540
you turned that into high x then you set

593
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:42,180
up your booth so the people that are in

594
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:43,230
charge of the marijuana control I can't

595
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:44,370
remember the name of their division I

596
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:46,920
should have written that down sorry

597
00:20:44,369 --> 00:20:48,839
those folks are threatening to walk

598
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:50,850
through the cannabis cup at the time I'm

599
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:52,289
recording it hasn't happened so far it's

600
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:56,189
gone off without a hitch

601
00:20:52,289 --> 00:20:58,259
but this is what happens when we go from

602
00:20:56,190 --> 00:21:00,210
the wild wild west so I was good sing

603
00:20:58,259 --> 00:21:01,109
but they're letting people in through

604
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:02,519
these gates and they're checking

605
00:21:01,109 --> 00:21:04,019
everybody but the vendors that have

606
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:05,759
products that are allowed to come in are

607
00:21:04,019 --> 00:21:07,230
coming in through a back gate and able

608
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:08,759
to set up so they've got product this is

609
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:10,730
how they're making sure no illegal

610
00:21:08,759 --> 00:21:12,900
cannabis sales are happening there right

611
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:15,269
yeah kind of weird Mike's role in his

612
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:17,580
eyes it's we're stuck in this awkward

613
00:21:15,269 --> 00:21:20,970
spot where we're trying to host an event

614
00:21:17,579 --> 00:21:24,960
that's like 50% football professional

615
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:27,690
football game 50% Burning Man and we're

616
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:32,250
trying to do it a hundred percent in the

617
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:34,529
football arena venues and the only way

618
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:36,390
to at this point to get the events that

619
00:21:34,529 --> 00:21:38,670
we want to attend where there's

620
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:41,520
consumption where you can go around and

621
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:43,110
sample different people's products you

622
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:45,029
know enjoy yourself just like you would

623
00:21:43,109 --> 00:21:46,829
at the Great American Beer Fest we taste

624
00:21:45,029 --> 00:21:48,930
a Colorado or any of those other events

625
00:21:46,829 --> 00:21:51,029
to actually get that event off you

626
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:53,880
really need to go to the middle of

627
00:21:51,029 --> 00:21:56,369
nowhere and allow open consumption

628
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:58,710
events like my dream would be to bring

629
00:21:56,369 --> 00:22:00,750
one to this a 4/20 event to the State

630
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:02,100
Fair down here it's the perfect space

631
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:03,960
there's plenty indoor there's plenty

632
00:22:02,099 --> 00:22:05,849
outdoor they could do it so [ __ ] when

633
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:07,799
High Times was looking for the venue I

634
00:22:05,849 --> 00:22:09,599
recommended the State Fair and they

635
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:11,460
basically laughed in my face the State

636
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:13,589
Fair and High Times both were like yeah

637
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:15,090
right which is dumb both of them can

638
00:22:13,589 --> 00:22:16,409
make a fortune there right there's

639
00:22:15,089 --> 00:22:18,149
plenty of parking there's plenty of

640
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:20,910
indoor and or outdoor buildings because

641
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:23,670
places for concert yeah yeah there's

642
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:26,970
three different stages endless square

643
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:29,850
footage for vending young booths of all

644
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:31,680
kinds like when I could never happen I

645
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:33,899
could walk there right in this art

646
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:35,490
there's plenty of indoor outdoor sea you

647
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:38,450
can have all the consumption you want

648
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:42,569
and never have a building full of smoke

649
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:44,610
it I mean it's it would be so easy to do

650
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:47,240
it's stupid yeah but it'll never happen

651
00:22:44,609 --> 00:22:50,579
for lots of reasons like in Colorado

652
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:53,309
licensed cannabis businesses can't give

653
00:22:50,579 --> 00:22:57,659
away at anything period and so like even

654
00:22:53,309 --> 00:23:00,450
if they go to an event and only hand out

655
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:04,200
t-shirts and [ __ ] they're still kind of

656
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:05,400
pushing it they're supposed to sit there

657
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:08,610
and charge you a penny for

658
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:10,350
even for the t-shirt yeah why okay just

659
00:23:08,609 --> 00:23:12,449
so that they're not give giving anything

660
00:23:10,349 --> 00:23:14,308
away is its product and there's some

661
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:16,289
legislature at some point will like but

662
00:23:14,308 --> 00:23:18,269
drug dealers give out free samples to

663
00:23:16,289 --> 00:23:21,599
hook patient you know it's always been

664
00:23:18,269 --> 00:23:24,359
the catch yes it's like no we're just

665
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:26,909
wag just like the record people you know

666
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:30,329
buy the CD here's the t-shirt get

667
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:32,009
excited right it's so well Friday when

668
00:23:30,329 --> 00:23:33,389
the cannabis cup was setting up a lot of

669
00:23:32,009 --> 00:23:35,549
people were missing there were a lot of

670
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:38,130
empty booth space don't slam about a

671
00:23:35,549 --> 00:23:39,659
third of the booths showed up the event

672
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:41,070
went on Friday people came in the

673
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:42,570
concerts that were scheduled for Friday

674
00:23:41,069 --> 00:23:44,009
night happened to the bands performed

675
00:23:42,569 --> 00:23:46,319
people smoked out and had a good time

676
00:23:44,009 --> 00:23:47,700
and watched these bands nothing happened

677
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:49,379
Saturday things would not went off

678
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:50,940
without a hitch we were far into Sunday

679
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:52,200

681

down or walked through the cannabis cup

687
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:07,950

699
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:28,620
cannabis soldiers since when do we need

700
00:24:26,849 --> 00:24:30,329
permits to be cannabis warriors when do

701
00:24:28,619 --> 00:24:32,459

702
00:24:30,329 --> 00:24:36,210
on so ah I want to give a huge shout out

703
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:39,179
not just to swerve but to everybody who

704
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:41,519
still has that cannabis warrior [ __ ]

705
00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:42,179
spirit this isn't we're getting too

706
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:45,089
comfortable

707
00:24:42,179 --> 00:24:46,590
a lot of the suits and the bureaucrats

708
00:24:45,089 --> 00:24:48,720
and whoever you want to call them are

709
00:24:46,589 --> 00:24:49,199
taking over they've gotten involved it's

710
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,230
there

711
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,640
we're losing the passion all of those

712
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:54,839
people were the people that were scared

713
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,670
to show up those were all the people

714
00:24:54,839 --> 00:24:59,220
that didn't do it there's a lot more to

715
00:24:56,670 --> 00:25:02,340
risk now like absolutely you can't start

716
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:04,890
over by getting a job at Home Depot and

717
00:25:02,339 --> 00:25:06,720
just sucking it up for six months and

718
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:09,390
saving your money and going to get into

719
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:13,079
lights and a [ __ ] fan and getting

720
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:15,120
back to it like if you [ __ ] up now and

721
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:17,849
you crash out you're out millions

722
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:18,469
millions Esther's absolutely in half

723
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:20,240
every

724
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:22,009
paycheck you weren't from now - you die

725
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,259
is gonna go to pain those [ __ ] off

726
00:25:22,009 --> 00:25:25,759
right but I just want to give huge

727
00:25:24,259 --> 00:25:27,470
respect to all the people that didn't

728
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:29,210
push out that showed up and said hey

729
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:30,740
they're trying to shut us down watch us

730
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:32,480
watch me do it because that's what I do

731
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:33,529
because I'm a cannabis soldier because

732
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,038
that's where we are that's where our

733
00:25:33,529 --> 00:25:35,089
heart is

734
00:25:34,038 --> 00:25:36,890
I just have a lot of respect for those

735
00:25:35,089 --> 00:25:40,038
folks I respect the other folks too in

736
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:42,470
the same way but take a lot of soldiers

737
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:44,839
doing what they do to get us to where we

738
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:48,380
want to be I think everyone in the

739
00:25:44,839 --> 00:25:51,109
cannabis community wants to at least

740
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:53,600
have the option to attend a 4/20 event

741
00:25:51,109 --> 00:25:55,699
or it doesn't even have to be a 4/20

742
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:58,519
event but that we can go consume at like

743
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:59,990
if I go to a baseball game I want to be

744
00:25:58,519 --> 00:26:02,179
able to go to the smoking section

745
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:04,069
take a couple hits off my bowl put it

746
00:26:02,179 --> 00:26:06,519
away grab some nachos and go back to my

747
00:26:04,069 --> 00:26:09,200
seat and it shouldn't [ __ ] be

748
00:26:06,519 --> 00:26:12,288
earth-shattering that that's a desire

749
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,850
yeah like half the [ __ ] there in

750
00:26:12,288 --> 00:26:15,319
line getting beers one of my earliest

751
00:26:13,849 --> 00:26:17,839
memories it's part of the reason I'm not

752
00:26:15,319 --> 00:26:19,428
a big fan or organized pro sports is we

753
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:20,990
were in line to get nachos and [ __ ] and

754
00:26:19,429 --> 00:26:23,720
dude in front of my dad turned around

755
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:25,849
and just up and did four beers over me

756
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:28,548
and my brother like dude didn't mean to

757
00:26:25,849 --> 00:26:30,769
he was out 24 bucks or whatever but we

758
00:26:28,548 --> 00:26:34,460
got to enjoy the whole game soaked in so

759
00:26:30,769 --> 00:26:36,230
like six and eight in like you know six

760
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:40,090
an eight-year-old likes beer now

761
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:42,409
Terry was just miserable you're sticky

762
00:26:40,089 --> 00:26:44,959
but like that's a hundred percent cool

763
00:26:42,409 --> 00:26:46,610
and it happens at every event everywhere

764
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,788
why can't there just be a little section

765
00:26:46,609 --> 00:26:51,529
for me to go toke out like I get no one

766
00:26:49,788 --> 00:26:53,089
wanted me to smoke in the seats don't be

767
00:26:51,529 --> 00:26:56,720
a dick and light up and you don't be a

768
00:26:53,089 --> 00:26:58,279
[ __ ] Rob Corey like I won't dab right

769
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,169
by your kids if you have me a little

770
00:26:58,279 --> 00:27:02,538
section I'll go there yeah

771
00:27:00,169 --> 00:27:07,070
probably won't leave there yeah let us

772
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:08,869
go off to a side thing I mean there's

773
00:27:07,069 --> 00:27:10,490
within reason like if I can't take a

774
00:27:08,869 --> 00:27:11,689
water bottle into a venue I don't think

775
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:14,150
you're gonna get away with AD a breaking

776
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:16,460
the torch the like a vape pen for

777
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:19,070
concentrates or a [ __ ] joint or a

778
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:21,440
bowl look we've been using enjoying

779
00:27:19,069 --> 00:27:23,960
these at concerts for all of our lives

780
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,610
the idea that we just make a space for

781
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:27,500
that so we don't have to do it on the

782
00:27:25,609 --> 00:27:30,798
down-low why is it [ __ ] nuts if I had

783
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:31,878
a box seat and uh Folsom Field in

784
00:27:30,798 --> 00:27:33,769
Boulder right those

785
00:27:31,878 --> 00:27:35,628
expensive they're 120 bucks a person for

786
00:27:33,769 --> 00:27:37,308
a box or you can rip the whole box for

787
00:27:35,628 --> 00:27:38,928
like 3GS or something like that you get

788
00:27:37,308 --> 00:27:40,398
that box and they bring out a little

789
00:27:38,929 --> 00:27:42,579
fridge with [ __ ] in it and then you get

790
00:27:40,398 --> 00:27:46,518
free food and drinks and [ __ ]

791
00:27:42,578 --> 00:27:47,838
those are semi-private what if should I

792
00:27:46,519 --> 00:27:49,269
be able to bring my rig in there and

793
00:27:47,838 --> 00:27:56,868
take some dabs in there

794
00:27:49,269 --> 00:27:58,669
should you yes are you probably not I'm

795
00:27:56,868 --> 00:28:01,068
sure plenty of people have and I've had

796
00:27:58,669 --> 00:28:02,089
that idea before like I would love sorry

797
00:28:01,068 --> 00:28:03,979
this is the torch II guys here I

798
00:28:02,088 --> 00:28:05,298
apologize recent couple of events that

799
00:28:03,979 --> 00:28:07,959
I'd love to attend and I've thought

800
00:28:05,298 --> 00:28:10,338
about like you know it that events worth

801
00:28:07,959 --> 00:28:13,190
taking the time putting that money aside

802
00:28:10,338 --> 00:28:14,838
getting a box you know get 8 or 10

803
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:17,328
friends together put that planning

804
00:28:14,838 --> 00:28:19,458
together and I mean if you take it to a

805
00:28:17,328 --> 00:28:22,338
breaking a torture or something where

806
00:28:19,459 --> 00:28:25,009
you're vaping rather than burning you're

807
00:28:22,338 --> 00:28:26,658
not gonna offend or annoy or even tip

808
00:28:25,009 --> 00:28:30,649
off the people in the boxes on either

809
00:28:26,659 --> 00:28:32,719
side of you but for us to get to a point

810
00:28:30,648 --> 00:28:35,148
where this doesn't happen to have has to

811
00:28:32,719 --> 00:28:36,649
happen half on the down-low like a lot

812
00:28:35,148 --> 00:28:40,518
of people are gonna have to stand up and

813
00:28:36,648 --> 00:28:43,908
fight like no one understands how many

814
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:46,009
of us there are no one understands how

815
00:28:43,909 --> 00:28:50,089
the community operates what we like what

816
00:28:46,009 --> 00:28:53,868
we don't like I mean a third or more of

817
00:28:50,088 --> 00:28:57,348
Americans believe the propaganda we got

818
00:28:53,868 --> 00:28:58,999
in there like a third of Americans are

819
00:28:57,348 --> 00:29:00,439
us a third or in the middle and don't

820
00:28:58,999 --> 00:29:02,019
really give a [ __ ] and a third or

821
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:05,269
against this that's just how it works

822
00:29:02,019 --> 00:29:08,028
and unfortunately most of us have I mean

823
00:29:05,269 --> 00:29:09,818
we've survived by staying hidden and

824
00:29:08,028 --> 00:29:13,128
that's good advice in a lot of places

825
00:29:09,818 --> 00:29:15,019
keep it quiet or end up in jail perfect

826
00:29:13,128 --> 00:29:17,388
ramp mic I just took the biggest dab of

827
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:19,638
some men Rapha dad sit across a total my

828
00:29:17,388 --> 00:29:20,898
gosh that was so awesome here well he

829
00:29:19,638 --> 00:29:24,948
better are actually you started heating

830
00:29:20,898 --> 00:29:26,388
that up I'll get you a little dab mike

831
00:29:24,949 --> 00:29:28,369
is right you guys we do need a lot more

832
00:29:26,388 --> 00:29:30,138
a lot more fighting a lot more soldiers

833
00:29:28,368 --> 00:29:31,878
but this is what happens when you get

834
00:29:30,138 --> 00:29:34,128
legalization when you regulate something

835
00:29:31,878 --> 00:29:35,778
we are going from an unregulated market

836
00:29:34,128 --> 00:29:38,378
where people would bring their backpacks

837
00:29:35,778 --> 00:29:40,219
and just hustle it out to a taxed

838
00:29:38,378 --> 00:29:41,448
regulate it oh I'm trying to kill Mike

839
00:29:40,219 --> 00:29:44,359
I'm giving them away too big of a dab to

840
00:29:41,449 --> 00:29:45,620
a taxed regulated market we kind of

841
00:29:44,358 --> 00:29:48,349
voted for this we kind of asked

842
00:29:45,619 --> 00:29:50,979
for this we talk about it as a consumer

843
00:29:48,349 --> 00:29:55,189
I want it like I want the but I'm buying

844
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:57,950
to have a prior or part of its price be

845
00:29:55,190 --> 00:30:00,019
lab testing yes I like knowing that my

846
00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:04,190
[ __ ] doesn't have mold or yeast or heavy

847
00:30:00,019 --> 00:30:06,349
metals or pesticides so what I was

848
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:09,259
getting at is when you guys are voting

849
00:30:06,349 --> 00:30:12,048
and setting up the rules and regulations

850
00:30:09,259 --> 00:30:15,379
for the legal cannabis in your area what

851
00:30:12,048 --> 00:30:18,019
you've got to do is include somewhere to

852
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:19,580
consume put consumption in your rules

853
00:30:18,019 --> 00:30:21,829
that's what we missed here that's what

854
00:30:19,579 --> 00:30:23,629
they write in Colorado for the last year

855
00:30:21,829 --> 00:30:26,089
has been consumption and we're not gonna

856
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:28,399
win for another four or five years like

857
00:30:26,089 --> 00:30:31,009
Mike said there are so many places where

858
00:30:28,398 --> 00:30:32,359
we can gather Colorado was a beer state

859
00:30:31,009 --> 00:30:34,460
Colorado loves beer

860
00:30:32,359 --> 00:30:36,019
there's beer everywhere we can gather

861
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:38,450
everywhere you can go to the State Fair

862
00:30:36,019 --> 00:30:41,000
and buy a big-ass beer and walk around

863
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:42,830
the State Fair and drink of beer there's

864
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,048
kids there like Mike said at the [ __ ]

865
00:30:42,829 --> 00:30:48,048
baseball game he got beer spilled on him

866
00:30:45,048 --> 00:30:49,970
he was a kid it's unfair so you're gonna

867
00:30:48,048 --> 00:30:51,230
have to write back into your rules that

868
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:53,390
there is somewhere where you can suit

869
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:56,630
consumed we can buy cannabis we can grow

870
00:30:53,390 --> 00:31:00,140
we can gift we can share we can

871
00:30:56,630 --> 00:31:01,640
everything but ship and transport export

872
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:03,110
cannabis or you can do it all

873
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:06,788
Mike's gonna die I'm gonna turn down

874
00:31:03,109 --> 00:31:08,689
your mic but we can't consume it anymore

875
00:31:06,788 --> 00:31:10,879
you're not allowed to consume cannabis

876
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:12,019
anywhere you've got to go home even if

877
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,340
you were from out of state you can't

878
00:31:12,019 --> 00:31:15,079
consume in your hotel you've got to get

879
00:31:13,339 --> 00:31:17,058
an air B&amp;B is the only way you can do it

880
00:31:15,079 --> 00:31:18,619
and you've even got to ask the air B&amp;B

881
00:31:17,058 --> 00:31:20,240
people can we smoke weed in your house

882
00:31:18,619 --> 00:31:22,428
and a lot of them before you even rent

883
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:24,399
it it will say no cannabis right on the

884
00:31:22,429 --> 00:31:26,298
page when you're trying to rent so that

885
00:31:24,398 --> 00:31:27,678
makes sure that when you're writing the

886
00:31:26,298 --> 00:31:28,730
rules in your area I'm gonna get your

887
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:29,870
mic back on for you Mike

888
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:31,250
make sure that when you're writing the

889
00:31:29,869 --> 00:31:32,869
rules that when you're setting up the

890
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:34,970
legislation for cannabis in your area

891
00:31:32,869 --> 00:31:38,209
make sure that you include some sort of

892
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:40,970
way to consume maybe you allow some sort

893
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:42,200
of smoke clubs don't let don't make it

894
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:44,269
to where we're allowed to smoke weed in

895
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:46,880
the park at 4:20 don't do that be an

896
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:50,200
adult make a designated area if you want

897
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:52,580
it to actually pass it has to be smart

898
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:56,269
something like Jeff's talking about what

899
00:31:52,579 --> 00:31:58,460
have to be is this state rule it would

900
00:31:56,269 --> 00:32:01,089
have to allow local municipalities to

901
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:01,090
opt in

902
00:32:01,159 --> 00:32:07,610
or define exactly how they wanted it to

903
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:10,730
play in their area but honestly I see

904
00:32:07,609 --> 00:32:14,148
this evolving sort of like bars in Utah

905
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:16,788
you've got to be a member or I mean

906
00:32:14,148 --> 00:32:18,199
maybe following the sex club model where

907
00:32:16,788 --> 00:32:19,908
it's way the [ __ ] out in the middle of

908
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:22,850
nowhere and it's only word-of-mouth

909
00:32:19,909 --> 00:32:26,110
there's no advertising but like the

910
00:32:22,849 --> 00:32:29,298
community needs a place together yes and

911
00:32:26,109 --> 00:32:31,459
we don't have that now at all there step

912
00:32:29,298 --> 00:32:34,190
stomping down on events hardcore right

913
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:35,509
now think about man I wish and this is

914
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:37,730
the wrong audience because these people

915
00:32:35,509 --> 00:32:39,769
all agree with us but just think about

916
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:41,120
this you've got your local bar right and

917
00:32:39,769 --> 00:32:42,440
we're just gonna say it's a biker bar

918
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:44,178
because that's really good for people to

919
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:46,820
visualize you got this little janky

920
00:32:44,179 --> 00:32:48,649
shanty biker bar with some [ __ ] loud

921
00:32:46,819 --> 00:32:50,629
ass rock and roll band I was probably in

922
00:32:48,648 --> 00:32:52,969
it playing in the backyard too loud at

923
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:55,220
midnight playing [ __ ] mustang sally'

924
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:57,079
or seek-and-destroy way too loud with

925
00:32:55,220 --> 00:33:02,929
motorcycles I'll wind up around the

926
00:32:57,079 --> 00:33:04,699
building all night long right or or you

927
00:33:02,929 --> 00:33:06,649
could have a little 420 friendly Club

928
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:08,720
right a bunch of Volkswagen buses

929
00:33:06,648 --> 00:33:10,479
outside a bunch of people just chillin

930
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:15,259
listenin to the Grateful Dead inside

931
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:17,720
smells like nachos they don't get a lot

932
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:19,429
of press so if you're not me you don't

933
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:21,319
see a lot of air if you're not like me

934
00:33:19,429 --> 00:33:23,509
you don't see a lot of it but right now

935
00:33:21,319 --> 00:33:26,418
the anti pop people their message is

936
00:33:23,509 --> 00:33:29,450
that the high potency products of today

937
00:33:26,419 --> 00:33:32,059
cause mental illness and psychosis in

938
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:35,808
like all the mass shooters it's cuz they

939
00:33:32,058 --> 00:33:37,490
smoke weed yeah already this [ __ ] the

940
00:33:35,808 --> 00:33:39,829
Waffle House dude from today they're

941
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:41,329
like yeah he visited Colorado when he

942
00:33:39,829 --> 00:33:46,788
wasn't wearing pants it must have been

943
00:33:41,329 --> 00:33:48,859
the weed like and yeah I chuckle because

944
00:33:46,788 --> 00:33:51,759
anyone in the community knows it's

945
00:33:48,859 --> 00:33:54,439
insane we've been at the concert with

946
00:33:51,759 --> 00:33:56,500
1500 people smoking pot in a concert

947
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:58,788
venue that holds seven or eight thousand

948
00:33:56,500 --> 00:34:01,609
1500 2000 people have sent their puffs

949
00:33:58,788 --> 00:34:04,669
in if consuming marijuana just caused

950
00:34:01,609 --> 00:34:06,949
people to pop off wait a [ __ ] notice

951
00:34:04,669 --> 00:34:08,838
yeah yeah that's what keeps us from

952
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:12,409
popping off that's what keeps us melting

953
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:14,538
what keeps us in our place but

954
00:34:12,409 --> 00:34:17,240
people that have never been part of our

955
00:34:14,539 --> 00:34:21,049
community in I mean I lose sight of it

956
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:23,328
too because I'm such a so engrained into

957
00:34:21,048 --> 00:34:26,269
the community like it's I I get up I

958
00:34:23,329 --> 00:34:27,829
it's part of my breakfast it's what I do

959
00:34:26,269 --> 00:34:28,730
all day at work it's what I do when I

960
00:34:27,829 --> 00:34:33,740
get home

961
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:35,210
like I eat sleep and breathe it yeah but

962
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:36,348
a lot of people don't like there are

963
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:39,760
people that eat sleep and breathe

964
00:34:36,349 --> 00:34:43,879
football or advertising or newspapers

965
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:46,099
that don't know any really know anything

966
00:34:43,878 --> 00:34:51,168
about our community and when they see

967
00:34:46,099 --> 00:34:55,599
[ __ ] like high potency weed causes

968
00:34:51,168 --> 00:35:00,199
psychosis they go oh kind of makes sense

969
00:34:55,599 --> 00:35:05,298
and there's not a voice for most people

970
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:07,250
opposing that and so just I mean getting

971
00:35:05,298 --> 00:35:09,679
out and just finding those people and

972
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:11,239
being like hi I like dabs do you see

973
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:12,949
that I'm [ __ ] normal and I show up to

974
00:35:11,239 --> 00:35:15,108
my job five days a week and I do a good

975
00:35:12,949 --> 00:35:16,969
job while I'm here and it's just Ana

976
00:35:15,108 --> 00:35:19,400
toxicant that's different than alcohol

977
00:35:16,969 --> 00:35:21,980
that I enjoy it's not anything

978
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:25,369
miraculous are scary or frightening like

979
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:27,528
please don't outlaw me like that's a

980
00:35:25,369 --> 00:35:28,880
hard conversation to have in parts of

981
00:35:27,528 --> 00:35:32,719
the country where everything's illegal

982
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:34,369
but if you want [ __ ] to progress like

983
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:36,169
little by little you have to start

984
00:35:34,369 --> 00:35:39,798
breaking down assumptions and prejudices

985
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:42,349
and this starts by being like hi I like

986
00:35:39,798 --> 00:35:45,079
weed I'm completely normal we can say

987
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:46,548
that this Mendo breath is some of the

988
00:35:45,079 --> 00:35:48,410
best concentrates on the planet right

989
00:35:46,548 --> 00:35:50,420
yeah like I'm not saying that this would

990
00:35:48,409 --> 00:35:53,179
win the best concentrate but this is in

991
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:55,369
the category I mean this would be the

992
00:35:53,179 --> 00:35:57,169
fun part about being in Colorado is I

993
00:35:55,369 --> 00:35:59,298
can confidently and honestly say that

994
00:35:57,170 --> 00:36:02,210
right now at the table that I'm sitting

995
00:35:59,298 --> 00:36:04,579
at some of the finest concentrates in

996
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:07,338
the history of humankind yeah yeah and

997
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:09,500
it's I'm we're not brown this my point

998
00:36:07,338 --> 00:36:11,750
isn't bragging right now I have got I'm

999
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:13,639
bragging a little there's 12 grams of

1000
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:15,260
hash on the table different flavors

1001
00:36:13,639 --> 00:36:17,118
different vendors different brands

1002
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:18,349
different consistencies we've got oh

1003
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:20,720
there's more over there Mike brought

1004

1006
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:26,170
green dot [ __ ] white and urban this

1007
00:36:25,219 --> 00:36:28,838
could win it

1008
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:30,670
this [ __ ] star killer star child

1009
00:36:28,838 --> 00:36:32,259
could win an award mindo breath award

1010
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:35,700
winner all of these could do something

1011
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:39,670
this [ __ ] King Louie put me on my ass

1012
00:36:35,699 --> 00:36:41,889
we probably took six dabs before we

1013
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:44,139
recorded like reasonably six days each

1014
00:36:41,889 --> 00:36:45,400
because I thought there's there's seven

1015
00:36:44,139 --> 00:36:47,409
containers here we tried almost all of

1016
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:49,119
them right in front of me and then

1017
00:36:47,409 --> 00:36:51,098
there's D we tried this one for sure we

1018
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:53,588
tried we didn't try this one we tried

1019
00:36:51,099 --> 00:36:56,440
almost everything I bought today we

1020
00:36:53,588 --> 00:37:00,190
tried so we've had two four six seven

1021
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:02,200
we've had at least seven dad's ah you

1022
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:03,849
feel like going crazy yet no just

1023
00:37:02,199 --> 00:37:05,710
chilling to say that all the time I go

1024
00:37:03,849 --> 00:37:08,140
oh is that the wheat psychosis that I

1025
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:11,199
always hear about yeah I could go for

1026
00:37:08,139 --> 00:37:12,519
it's not a thing it's if you if you

1027
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:14,439
really dig into the research what

1028
00:37:12,519 --> 00:37:16,329
they're talking about is when you get to

1029
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:17,530
the hospital you've had way too much

1030
00:37:16,329 --> 00:37:18,848
weed and you're freaking out and you

1031
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:19,510
insist who your friends take you to the

1032
00:37:18,849 --> 00:37:21,039
hospital

1033
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:23,500
these you're definitely having a heart

1034
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:24,608
attack did you get to the hospital and

1035
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:26,050
they're like you know what year it is

1036
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:27,880
and you know like yeah and you tell them

1037
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:29,890
and they're like okay how long have you

1038
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:31,900
been sitting in this office and you're

1039
00:37:29,889 --> 00:37:34,029
like oh man like half an hour 45 minutes

1040
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:35,889
and it's only been like four minutes if

1041
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:38,680
that's just you being baked yeah that's

1042
00:37:35,889 --> 00:37:39,759
the effects of the intoxication but

1043
00:37:38,679 --> 00:37:42,190
that's when they say that you're crazy

1044
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:45,609
that's not being able to accurately

1045
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:48,700
gauge time as part of being psychotic

1046
00:37:45,608 --> 00:37:51,219
yeah okay and so like it could it's part

1047
00:37:48,699 --> 00:37:53,559
of a mental illness and it's it's one of

1048
00:37:51,219 --> 00:37:55,419
the reasons that doctors are able to say

1049
00:37:53,559 --> 00:37:58,299
oh we see weed psychosis all the time

1050
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:59,200
and it's like well you see being high

1051
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:00,609
yeah

1052
00:37:59,199 --> 00:38:02,618
like I can't keep track of time if I

1053
00:38:00,608 --> 00:38:06,190
take booze drinks either I said take

1054
00:38:02,619 --> 00:38:08,789
booze drinks and sometimes this [ __ ] can

1055
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:11,409
get pretty extreme because we've got

1056
00:38:08,789 --> 00:38:13,420
some amazing [ __ ] right now and every

1057
00:38:11,409 --> 00:38:15,608
now and then someone who's never smoked

1058
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:17,409
weed before it's like I want to take a

1059
00:38:15,608 --> 00:38:19,690
really big dab like I see him doing

1060
00:38:17,409 --> 00:38:22,059
YouTube and so they go to the dispensary

1061
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:23,829
they buy a torch they buy a rig they buy

1062
00:38:22,059 --> 00:38:25,630
grandma hash they go home they try to

1063
00:38:23,829 --> 00:38:27,940
take a half gram dad they cop for five

1064
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:29,858
minutes they lay down on the floor they

1065
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:31,960
sit back up and they freak the [ __ ] out

1066
00:38:29,858 --> 00:38:34,358
but it's no different than when you were

1067
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:35,769
a teenager and you drank too much and

1068
00:38:34,358 --> 00:38:37,480
then threw up all over your cousin and

1069
00:38:35,769 --> 00:38:38,710
then blacked out and now you can't drink

1070
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:42,099
sour apple pucker no more

1071
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:45,849
it snowed [ __ ] different but because

1072
00:38:42,099 --> 00:38:47,559
this community hides so well it just

1073
00:38:45,849 --> 00:38:49,750
plays out so [ __ ] terribly in the

1074
00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:51,789
press I'm just checking the labels on

1075
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:55,570
some of the concentrates do I grab today

1076
00:38:51,789 --> 00:38:57,400
that one is 92% THC mm-hmm this one

1077
00:38:55,570 --> 00:38:59,350
they're all crinkled up because the way

1078
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:01,869
they stick them on the jar but total

1079
00:38:59,349 --> 00:39:06,579

1083
00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:14,559
so sexy we took pictures it was

1084
00:39:12,579 --> 00:39:18,460
basically one giant diamond that way to

1085
00:39:14,559 --> 00:39:22,239
Graham and it's 95 this 1% total one

1086
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:26,610
giant suck in space rock so we're

1087
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:26,609
smoking the [ __ ] the concentrates the

1088

1095
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:46,269
it's the whole plant extract they just

1096

00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:40,570
and that's sort of what happened but did

1117
00:40:38,889 --> 00:40:44,309
never trust somebody who's that orange

00:41:16,739 --> 00:41:19,858
he's saying that he's gonna be on our

1129
00:41:19,409 --> 00:41:22,649
team

1130
00:41:19,858 --> 00:41:24,809
well it's there's some run-up to this

1131
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:26,789
story like when Jeff Sessions started

1132
00:41:24,809 --> 00:41:29,849
really screwing with legal marijuana

1133
00:41:26,789 --> 00:41:33,150
states and really started threatening a

1134
00:41:29,849 --> 00:41:36,030
crackdown of some sort a lot of

1135
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:38,550
politicians said [ __ ] off and and did

1136
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:41,150
some things to counter that one of those

1137
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:44,609
things was Colorado senator Cory Gardner

1138
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:47,160
um put a hold on a bunch of nominees it

1139
00:41:44,608 --> 00:41:49,889
was like it's part of my job to approve

1140
00:41:47,159 --> 00:41:52,199
these guys if you want to screw with my

1141
00:41:49,889 --> 00:41:54,779
state's voters having approved

1142
00:41:52,199 --> 00:41:58,889
recreational cannabis I'm a screw with

1143
00:41:54,780 --> 00:42:02,790
your nominations how do you like me now

1144
00:41:58,889 --> 00:42:05,279
and it's been a stalemate kind of going

1145
00:42:02,789 --> 00:42:07,108
back and forth between a couple of

1146
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:10,170
different senators doing stuff like Cory

1147
00:42:07,108 --> 00:42:12,960
Gardner was doing and the current White

1148
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:17,760
House administration over legal cannabis

1149
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:20,730
and it came to a head last week the long

1150
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:22,230
or the short version is it Trump seems

1151
00:42:20,730 --> 00:42:25,349
like he really wants to fire somebody

1152
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:28,380
but to do that he would need Gardner to

1153
00:42:25,349 --> 00:42:30,470
approve the replacement and so to get

1154
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:33,420
Gardner to start approving people

1155
00:42:30,469 --> 00:42:35,669
replacements in other appointments he

1156
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:38,730
said that our Trump said that he would

1157
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:40,950
support an amendment similar to the

1158
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:42,780
Rohrbacher fire amendment or the rubic

1159
00:42:40,949 --> 00:42:45,750
Rohrbacher blue mayer amendment that

1160
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:48,690
protects medical marijuana basically

1161
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:50,639
that amendment says the feds can't spend

1162
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:52,470
money to go after legal medical

1163
00:42:50,639 --> 00:42:55,108
marijuana as if it's following state

1164
00:42:52,469 --> 00:42:58,980
rules Trump said he would support a

1165
00:42:55,108 --> 00:43:00,569
similar amendment covering recreational

1166
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:04,559
and throw the way to the white house

1167
00:43:00,570 --> 00:43:09,450
behind an amendment like that on one

1168
00:43:04,559 --> 00:43:12,420
hand if Trump is serious and Senators

1169
00:43:09,449 --> 00:43:14,219
submit that amendment and it makes it

1170
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:16,710
through committee and it makes it to the

1171
00:43:14,219 --> 00:43:20,909
floor and it gets voted on and it gets

1172
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:23,690
approved by the house and then it lands

1173
00:43:20,909 --> 00:43:26,009
on Trump's desk is part of a larger bill

1174
00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:27,630
that would provide protections for

1175
00:43:26,010 --> 00:43:30,510
recreational marijuana there's a lot of

1176
00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:32,490
steps between seven hands yeah I mean

1177
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:36,900
late steps a lot of [ __ ] has to happen

1178
00:43:32,489 --> 00:43:42,569
before this is anything other than a fun

1179
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:45,599
idea but on the upside it was definitely

1180
00:43:42,570 --> 00:43:49,230
a yank on Jeff Sessions leash saying

1181
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:52,200
like this is wildly inappropriate a

1182
00:43:49,230 --> 00:43:53,760
terrible way to spend resources do

1183
00:43:52,199 --> 00:43:57,049
something more interesting and that

1184
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:57,050
annoys less people

1185
00:43:58,199 --> 00:44:02,338
one thing Trump can do is read a poll

1186
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:05,010
like whether you like him or whether you

1187
00:44:02,338 --> 00:44:08,608
hate him he's clearly at least employing

1188
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:11,880
people who can read public opinion very

1189
00:44:08,608 --> 00:44:14,880
very well and everybody agrees that

1190
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:16,700
legalization and liberalisation of

1191
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:20,640
marijuana laws is very popular right now

1192
00:44:16,699 --> 00:44:22,289
so to see the Trump administration have

1193
00:44:20,639 --> 00:44:25,980
a Jeff Sessions going after us was

1194
00:44:22,289 --> 00:44:28,440
surprising seeing him walk it back was

1195
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:32,219
not surprising I'm definitely keeping a

1196
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:34,019
close eye on where this goes a couple of

1197
00:44:32,219 --> 00:44:36,868
senators have said they'll go ahead and

1198
00:44:34,019 --> 00:44:39,088
submit that amendment to protect

1199
00:44:36,869 --> 00:44:42,300
recreational marijuana like we do

1200
00:44:39,088 --> 00:44:44,880
medical because they've struggled to

1201
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:46,890
pass a federal spending bill the

1202
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:48,358
opportunity to slip that [ __ ] in there

1203
00:44:46,889 --> 00:44:49,469
is probably still there I honestly

1204
00:44:48,358 --> 00:44:52,170
haven't been following this as closely

1205
00:44:49,469 --> 00:44:54,179
as they should those of you who like me

1206
00:44:52,170 --> 00:44:56,730
on the podcast know that I've got a kid

1207
00:44:54,179 --> 00:44:58,469
I'm about to have another kid and so

1208
00:44:56,730 --> 00:45:00,088
I've been kind of busy and slacking on

1209
00:44:58,469 --> 00:45:02,730
my responsibilities but I did want to

1210
00:45:00,088 --> 00:45:03,960
get on and say something about peanuts

1211
00:45:02,730 --> 00:45:05,579
like a chump

1212
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:08,130
they're called priorities and you've got

1213
00:45:05,579 --> 00:45:09,839
him in order it's okay

1214
00:45:08,130 --> 00:45:12,088
earlier in the live feed somebody was

1215
00:45:09,838 --> 00:45:14,670
like can can Mike do a state-by-state

1216
00:45:12,088 --> 00:45:17,838
breakdown and how the non legalization

1217
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:20,130
states are faring and I was like I could

1218
00:45:17,838 --> 00:45:22,039
I can't right now

1219
00:45:20,130 --> 00:45:24,630
give me like a week I'll start writing I

1220
00:45:22,039 --> 00:45:27,659
do more than a week right now honest am

1221
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:31,230
so behind on that I've been running two

1222
00:45:27,659 --> 00:45:33,899
facilities instead of researching yes we

1223
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:36,659
are running 77 and 83 is what we call

1224
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:38,880
them if anybody listening would like

1225
00:45:36,659 --> 00:45:41,159
further clarification or has specific

1226
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:43,470
questions feel free to tweet me at Nemo

1227
00:45:41,159 --> 00:45:45,509
Punk 15 or hit me up on Facebook it

1228
00:45:43,469 --> 00:45:46,858
Pablo for sensible cannabis laws I'm

1229
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:50,069
happy to interact with you on those

1230
00:45:46,858 --> 00:45:52,409
platforms and answer your political

1231
00:45:50,068 --> 00:45:54,358
questions political weed questions so

1232
00:45:52,409 --> 00:45:56,068
how long you said it's got to jump

1233
00:45:54,358 --> 00:45:57,960
through those eight hoops before it

1234
00:45:56,068 --> 00:45:59,190
actually lands on his desk how do you

1235
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:01,490
have a timeline for that and I'm gonna

1236
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:03,630
take a DAB so you can happen and

1237
00:46:01,489 --> 00:46:08,159
relatively quickly like in a matter of

1238
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:10,470
weeks or it could take a year to like it

1239
00:46:08,159 --> 00:46:12,960
just governments like that

1240
00:46:10,469 --> 00:46:14,189
um I mean this guy's got a lot of a DD

1241
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,780
and it doesn't have anything to do with

1242
00:46:14,190 --> 00:46:17,400
this bicker his ego so it could get

1243
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:21,030
pushed aside right well and that's the

1244
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:23,250
thing like if this was something that

1245
00:46:21,030 --> 00:46:25,800
President Trump decided he was gonna

1246
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:28,199
make his number one issue and he was

1247
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:30,960
gonna spend most of his time focused

1248
00:46:28,199 --> 00:46:33,569
right now on making sure that marijuana

1249
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:35,159
legalization happened or something it

1250
00:46:33,570 --> 00:46:37,890
would still take him at least the rest

1251
00:46:35,159 --> 00:46:39,598
of it this term to make it happen just

1252
00:46:37,889 --> 00:46:42,089
with the amount of steps that have to

1253
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:45,000
happen for it to go from something that

1254
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:49,349
people want to make happen to something

1255
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:51,300
that is there's a lot of steps a lot of

1256
00:46:49,349 --> 00:46:52,670
steps you guys I just took a really big

1257
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:55,830
dab of really potent marijuana

1258
00:46:52,670 --> 00:46:57,420
concentrate still don't feel like

1259
00:46:55,829 --> 00:46:59,340
[ __ ] anything up that was big

1260
00:46:57,420 --> 00:47:00,659
I might [ __ ] up some ice cream if you

1261
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:01,260
got some Ben and Jerry's that she would

1262
00:47:00,659 --> 00:47:03,539
be in trouble

1263
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:05,040
hmm but that's the only thing I feel

1264
00:47:03,539 --> 00:47:06,719
like doing any harm to I hadn't moved

1265
00:47:05,039 --> 00:47:10,469
one of my feet in like an hour

1266
00:47:06,719 --> 00:47:12,239
oh you feeling all right over there this

1267
00:47:10,469 --> 00:47:13,769
will help this is the sour Pez live

1268
00:47:12,239 --> 00:47:15,659
resin ambrosia

1269
00:47:13,769 --> 00:47:17,309
it tastes like grapefruit and cotton

1270
00:47:15,659 --> 00:47:20,639
candy at the same time kind of weird

1271
00:47:17,309 --> 00:47:22,349
it's a [ __ ] honey it is very chirpy I

1272
00:47:20,639 --> 00:47:23,519
tried to get you a nice crystal and some

1273
00:47:22,349 --> 00:47:26,338
turps but I know you choked at

1274
00:47:23,519 --> 00:47:28,440
everything so I didn't go too hard you

1275
00:47:26,338 --> 00:47:29,549
guys well I heat up this dab nail I'm

1276
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:31,650
trying to get it a little further from

1277
00:47:29,550 --> 00:47:32,789
the mic so I can talk ah I want to thank

1278
00:47:31,650 --> 00:47:34,260
Mike for keeping us up-to-date

1279
00:47:32,789 --> 00:47:35,880
politically I know some people get

1280
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:37,470
[ __ ] bored of hearing about the

1281
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:40,079
political rants and the politics but

1282
00:47:37,469 --> 00:47:42,149
that is a huge part of cannabis activism

1283
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:44,460
what's going on being informed and

1284
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:46,079
staying aware is really important some

1285
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:47,789
of you guys might not care a lot of you

1286
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:50,250
really do care so I appreciate it when

1287
00:47:47,789 --> 00:47:55,170
Mike comes on that stuff with us it's

1288
00:47:50,250 --> 00:47:57,000
super important y'all like when I hear

1289
00:47:55,170 --> 00:48:00,180
people say that like they don't vote for

1290
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:02,699
this reason or that reason like I want

1291
00:48:00,179 --> 00:48:04,469
to slap them like you would a little kid

1292
00:48:02,699 --> 00:48:06,358
who was like yanking their sister's hair

1293
00:48:04,469 --> 00:48:07,829
like there's a lot of times you asked me

1294
00:48:06,358 --> 00:48:09,719
to edit [ __ ] out of the podcast is that

1295
00:48:07,829 --> 00:48:12,210
gonna be one of the things no it's just

1296
00:48:09,719 --> 00:48:14,419
our democracy works because people

1297
00:48:12,210 --> 00:48:17,338
participate in it and the reason

1298
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:20,769
cannabis consumers get [ __ ] on by so

1299
00:48:17,338 --> 00:48:23,949
many different segments of society is

1300
00:48:20,769 --> 00:48:27,730
cuz we haven't participated in the

1301
00:48:23,949 --> 00:48:30,909
system since the 60s get out of the

1302
00:48:27,730 --> 00:48:36,210
system [ __ ] the system became one of our

1303
00:48:30,909 --> 00:48:40,179
cornerstone values and it costs us a lot

1304
00:48:36,210 --> 00:48:49,900
we never had an organized group fighting

1305
00:48:40,179 --> 00:48:51,579
for protections or rights or anything we

1306
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:54,460
had exactly the opposite we had an

1307
00:48:51,579 --> 00:48:59,039
endless number of groups who made a

1308
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:59,039
career out of demonizing our community

1309
00:49:00,869 --> 00:49:07,480
we're villains in almost every way

1310
00:49:04,469 --> 00:49:09,159
politically and that's because of our

1311
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:11,440
non participation I need to take this

1312
00:49:09,159 --> 00:49:12,789
port is any colder for far too long our

1313
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:15,550
representatives were Cheech and Chong

1314
00:49:12,789 --> 00:49:16,090
and that that didn't I love Cheech I

1315
00:49:15,550 --> 00:49:18,190
love Chong

1316
00:49:16,090 --> 00:49:20,230
much respect they did a lot if it was

1317
00:49:18,190 --> 00:49:21,610
them not their characters in the movies

1318
00:49:20,230 --> 00:49:23,320
it would be different but it was their

1319
00:49:21,610 --> 00:49:25,510
characters in the movie right and that

1320
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:27,730
they didn't there was the exact

1321
00:49:25,510 --> 00:49:29,470
stereotype that we did not need that was

1322
00:49:27,730 --> 00:49:30,909
what made people say well look at those

1323
00:49:29,469 --> 00:49:32,919
burnouts look at those stoners that's

1324
00:49:30,909 --> 00:49:36,159
why we don't want it legal so for far

1325
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:37,720
too long we had fad until the people of

1326
00:49:36,159 --> 00:49:39,219
our generation I'm gonna kill you Mike

1327
00:49:37,719 --> 00:49:40,929
just because that's obnoxious Mike you

1328
00:49:39,219 --> 00:49:42,339
okay bro I'm gonna call nine-one-one

1329
00:49:40,929 --> 00:49:44,589
already gave me two thumbs up

1330
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:46,930
and so our generation came along and I

1331
00:49:44,590 --> 00:49:49,358
think things started to change with

1332
00:49:46,929 --> 00:49:50,769
maybe the kids right before me and then

1333
00:49:49,358 --> 00:49:52,809
our generation and then the people after

1334
00:49:50,769 --> 00:49:54,280
us they feel so entitled it's like we

1335
00:49:52,809 --> 00:49:55,779
want legal marijuana so they just went

1336
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:58,450
out and [ __ ] tried to make it happen

1337
00:49:55,780 --> 00:50:01,000
and it seems to be working in a lot of

1338
00:49:58,449 --> 00:50:03,849
the places so it just took time from

1339
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:05,858
people to wake up and then social media

1340
00:50:03,849 --> 00:50:08,440
really helped with the activism and

1341
00:50:05,858 --> 00:50:12,119
waking of people because a lot of

1342
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:14,858
cannabis consumers advocates speakers

1343
00:50:12,119 --> 00:50:16,690
we're better off at home who don't do so

1344
00:50:14,858 --> 00:50:18,608
well going out so being able to speak

1345
00:50:16,690 --> 00:50:24,220
our opinions from the comfort of our own

1346
00:50:18,608 --> 00:50:25,440
recording studio really helps us out we

1347
00:50:24,219 --> 00:50:28,449
made it

1348
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:31,780
having like we had to hide for our own

1349
00:50:28,449 --> 00:50:33,009
safety and we preach dropping out and

1350
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:38,410
getting out of the system and [ __ ]

1351
00:50:33,010 --> 00:50:41,440
Babylon and that allowed groups to pass

1352
00:50:38,409 --> 00:50:44,139
all sorts of rules so that if we dared

1353
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:47,440
to stand up and identify ourselves as

1354
00:50:44,139 --> 00:50:51,250
parts of this community we'd risk school

1355
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:54,220
funding housing opportunities job

1356
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:55,900
opportunities freedom opportunities

1357
00:50:54,219 --> 00:50:57,459
freedom yeah

1358
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:59,800
the Grover's would be arrested the

1359
00:50:57,460 --> 00:51:01,690
activists remember reading about grow

1360
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:03,940
houses getting busted when I was like

1361
00:51:01,690 --> 00:51:05,260
six and eight we're people that were

1362
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:09,309
growing under [ __ ] stoned

1363
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:15,210
streetlights in their basement people

1364
00:51:09,309 --> 00:51:18,670
cropping out way back in like 92 94 and

1365
00:51:15,210 --> 00:51:23,349
if you look at the numbers and do the

1366
00:51:18,670 --> 00:51:26,260
math like people's best guess is like 35

1367
00:51:23,349 --> 00:51:30,339
to 60 billion dollars in herb gets

1368
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:32,380
purchased coast-to-coast Wow and if you

1369
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:35,500
that's about the size of the cosmetics

1370
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:36,760
industry and so if you look it I mean

1371
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:39,489
just think about that for a minute

1372
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:41,470
how many places do you see cosmetics

1373
00:51:39,489 --> 00:51:44,619
period like eyeshadow lipstick all that

1374
00:51:41,469 --> 00:51:46,089
[ __ ] Walgreens Target Walmart [ __ ]

1375
00:51:44,619 --> 00:51:47,230
everywhere this stores where I go and

1376
00:51:46,090 --> 00:51:56,230
then you've got the places where I gotta

1377
00:51:47,230 --> 00:51:58,710
take my daughter whatever it's a massive

1378
00:51:56,230 --> 00:52:02,050
industry it's everywhere it requires

1379
00:51:58,710 --> 00:52:05,679
thousands of companies tens of thousands

1380
00:52:02,050 --> 00:52:08,260
of employees a massive amounts of light

1381
00:52:05,679 --> 00:52:14,739
trucks and boxes and people and shipping

1382
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:16,300
and now do that with weed so you can

1383
00:52:14,739 --> 00:52:19,389
kind of do the math and weed in your

1384
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:21,519
area and figure out how many individual

1385
00:52:19,389 --> 00:52:24,429
hey bro oh so you'll take you out source

1386
00:52:21,519 --> 00:52:27,849
our diesel cool that'll be delivered in

1387
00:52:24,429 --> 00:52:30,639
like how many of those transactions have

1388
00:52:27,849 --> 00:52:33,130
to take place if you've got a hundred

1389
00:52:30,639 --> 00:52:35,730
and fifty plant a house grow how many of

1390
00:52:33,130 --> 00:52:38,559
those house grows are required to supply

1391
00:52:35,730 --> 00:52:40,539
80 percent of the demand Coast the code

1392
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:43,570
which is estimated what we're producing

1393
00:52:40,539 --> 00:52:45,309
coast-to-coast and 20% import now it

1394
00:52:43,570 --> 00:52:48,070
used to be the other way right and

1395
00:52:45,309 --> 00:52:52,750
slowly the demand for domestic grown is

1396
00:52:48,070 --> 00:52:55,080
pushed out the import market but when

1397
00:52:52,750 --> 00:52:57,489
you look at all of that commerce

1398
00:52:55,079 --> 00:53:01,449
shifting that into a legal market is

1399
00:52:57,489 --> 00:53:03,279
freaking out all sorts of things and one

1400
00:53:01,449 --> 00:53:06,339
of the opportunities we have right now

1401
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:09,519
is there's this little window where

1402
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:12,820
people who weren't real deep into the

1403
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:17,259
black market can stand up and fight

1404
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:18,910
right now without risking too much like

1405
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:22,840
I was one of those people in Colorado

1406
00:53:18,909 --> 00:53:26,789
was on the cusp and I remember agonizing

1407
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:30,130
over can I be the person who stands up

1408
00:53:26,789 --> 00:53:32,590
because the odds that you get hammered

1409
00:53:30,130 --> 00:53:35,619
down when you're the first one to stand

1410
00:53:32,590 --> 00:53:38,380
up are huge and in pueblo the only

1411
00:53:35,619 --> 00:53:41,019
people talking for us were really bad at

1412
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:42,490
it talking for the community and they

1413
00:53:41,019 --> 00:53:45,070
needed someone who could put a whole

1414
00:53:42,489 --> 00:53:49,419
sentence together to stand up and speak

1415
00:53:45,070 --> 00:53:51,010
for legal cannabis and I attended

1416
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:53,230
meeting after meeting where no one

1417
00:53:51,010 --> 00:53:55,270
showed up and was able to do that and

1418
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:58,449
finally I broke and was like [ __ ] it

1419
00:53:55,269 --> 00:54:01,840
like maybe I have to get really creative

1420
00:53:58,449 --> 00:54:03,399
for employment from here on out and just

1421
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:05,550
know that I'm never gonna work for

1422
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:08,769
anybody who does a Google search first

1423
00:54:05,550 --> 00:54:10,720
because just stand up and speak about

1424
00:54:08,769 --> 00:54:14,619
legal cannabis and the need to legalize

1425
00:54:10,719 --> 00:54:16,359
it in any way mark she was a target and

1426
00:54:14,619 --> 00:54:19,389
that's still true in a lot of the

1427
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:21,460
country and so to have the balls to

1428
00:54:19,389 --> 00:54:25,029
stand up in a place like Alabama Georgia

1429
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:27,460
Texas yeah and really fight right now I

1430
00:54:25,030 --> 00:54:30,040
mean it takes like soldiers a good word

1431
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:32,679
it takes a set of balls that takes the

1432
00:54:30,039 --> 00:54:34,539
skill set it takes dedication but you

1433
00:54:32,679 --> 00:54:37,000
need to be doing your research you need

1434
00:54:34,539 --> 00:54:39,009
to know how the process works you can't

1435
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:40,420
go and propose that the people you're

1436
00:54:39,010 --> 00:54:43,330
talking to do [ __ ] they don't have the

1437
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:45,260
power to do please don't take them

1438
00:54:43,329 --> 00:54:47,630
marijuana

1439
00:54:45,260 --> 00:54:52,700
it's just it's not a it doesn't go over

1440
00:54:47,630 --> 00:54:54,140
well is weird like when people come and

1441
00:54:52,699 --> 00:54:55,669
talk to him about a restaurant they say

1442
00:54:54,139 --> 00:54:58,400
come to my restaurant they don't just

1443
00:54:55,670 --> 00:55:00,050
show up with food it should be the same

1444
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:01,579
way with cannabis go tell them what

1445
00:55:00,050 --> 00:55:03,080
you're about let them know where to come

1446
00:55:01,579 --> 00:55:04,909

YouTube is going and chopping down a lot

1597
01:00:12,539 --> 01:00:16,349
of cannabis related pages fortunately

1598
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:18,000
for me my videos don't have a lot of

1599
01:00:16,349 --> 01:00:20,159
cannabis happening it's just audio it's

1600
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:21,900
a picture of my ugly mug and audio maybe

1601
01:00:20,159 --> 01:00:25,019
I'll slip through maybe they'll let me

1602
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:28,050
live maybe they'll let me keep going if

1603
01:00:25,019 --> 01:00:29,429
I were a different type of channel they

1604
01:00:28,050 --> 01:00:33,980
wouldn't take me down why do they want

1605
01:00:29,429 --> 01:00:36,989
to take down the cannabis channels the

1606
01:00:33,980 --> 01:00:42,769
the Internet is doing there's a little

1607
01:00:36,989 --> 01:00:45,539
like smut purge personal ads on

1608
01:00:42,769 --> 01:00:48,269
Craigslist disappeared oh the personal

1609
01:00:45,539 --> 01:00:51,949
sections gone when I walked in you were

1610
01:00:48,269 --> 01:00:54,780
listening to a show who mentioned that a

1611
01:00:51,949 --> 01:00:57,419
popular message board for escorts in LA

1612
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:59,130
is gone now yep shut it off on in his

1613
01:00:57,420 --> 01:01:01,170
podcast I love that [ __ ] podcast

1614
01:00:59,130 --> 01:01:04,550
there's a couple of different social

1615
01:01:01,170 --> 01:01:09,630
media platforms that are purging

1616
01:01:04,550 --> 01:01:11,160
cannabis or gun-related and I don't say

1617
01:01:09,630 --> 01:01:14,369
those two it's just both of those

1618
01:01:11,159 --> 01:01:17,119
purchases are happening and it's

1619
01:01:14,369 --> 01:01:20,539
happening for a variety of reasons it's

1620
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:21,690
unfortunate but at the same time were a

1621
01:01:20,539 --> 01:01:23,639
community

1622
01:01:21,690 --> 01:01:25,619
operates in the shadows and as such were

1623
01:01:23,639 --> 01:01:29,429
subject to getting [ __ ] on regularly

1624
01:01:25,619 --> 01:01:30,660
step out of the shadows yeah if they

1625
01:01:29,429 --> 01:01:32,308
thought they were gonna receive some

1626
01:01:30,659 --> 01:01:35,308
sort of backlash for deleting the

1627
01:01:32,309 --> 01:01:38,220
content we enjoy in produce they

1628

1688
01:03:20,940 --> 01:03:25,409
[ __ ] frustrating you guys I did use

1689
01:03:23,789 --> 01:03:27,990
some of my own personal funds but I did

1690
01:03:25,409 --> 01:03:29,969
use a large portion of patreon funding

1691
01:03:27,989 --> 01:03:31,709
to buy a new MacBook I've recorded

1692
01:03:29,969 --> 01:03:33,538
several episodes on the new MacBook Pro

1693
01:03:31,710 --> 01:03:33,869

1695
01:03:33,869 --> 01:03:37,950

1696
01:03:35,460 --> 01:03:39,480
how much faster how much more quickly it

1697
01:03:37,949 --> 01:03:41,579

effort so thank you I appreciate that

1718
01:04:19,190 --> 01:04:25,409
lots of rants keep the questions coming

1719
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:28,409
yeah keep them leave you wondered why I

1720
01:04:25,409 --> 01:04:30,389
took the rant that way 50% of the time

1721
01:04:28,409 --> 01:04:31,859
for this episode tonight it's because of

1722
01:04:30,389 --> 01:04:33,629
the Facebook live before the show

1723
01:04:31,860 --> 01:04:35,309
oh the Instagram I feed him to Graham

1724
01:04:33,630 --> 01:04:36,660
live yeah not Facebook left that's how

1725
01:04:35,309 --> 01:04:38,730
high I am that's all right

1726
01:04:36,659 --> 01:04:39,989
once those are over I forgot them people

1727
01:04:38,730 --> 01:04:41,969
were like hey remember you said this and

1728
01:04:39,989 --> 01:04:43,529
like yeah I just go so fast and those

1729
01:04:41,969 --> 01:04:45,299
I'm fielding four and five questions at

1730
01:04:43,530 --> 01:04:46,800
a time right and so my brain is firing

1731
01:04:45,300 --> 01:04:48,360
in a really weird way and once it's over

1732
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:50,490
I go into like a weird recovery mode I

1733
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:52,320
have to watching the lag in person is

1734
01:04:50,489 --> 01:04:54,739
funny cuz I've got the feet up in front

1735
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:57,150
of me and I see you in person so

1736
01:04:54,739 --> 01:04:58,829
sometimes it gets a little hinky I feel

1737
01:04:57,150 --> 01:05:01,410
like when the show when the live feeds

1738
01:04:58,829 --> 01:05:03,059
are over the little the driver inside my

1739
01:05:01,409 --> 01:05:07,049
head has to go put all the files back in

1740
01:05:03,059 --> 01:05:09,719
the folders and put them back that was

1741
01:05:07,050 --> 01:05:11,519
so many files at once like yeah I just

1742
01:05:09,719 --> 01:05:12,989
kind of decompress after those for a

1743
01:05:11,519 --> 01:05:15,449
minute take a couple more dabs and wipe

1744
