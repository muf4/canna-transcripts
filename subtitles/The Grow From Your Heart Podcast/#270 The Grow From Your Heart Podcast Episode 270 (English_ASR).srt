I appreciate that all right let's work

102
00:03:30,049 --> 00:03:35,239
our way into another topic you guys this

103
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:37,310
is a little bit not cannabis related but

104
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:40,039
it is internet related and since my

105
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:41,930
podcast is an internet-based show I feel

106
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:44,358
that this topic may or may not affect

107
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:46,819
you Endor I in the future and I kind of

108
00:03:44,359 --> 00:03:50,150
wanted to bring it up on the podcast so

109
00:03:46,819 --> 00:03:52,909
today the FCC officially they repealed

110
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:54,200
net true net neutrality rules now let me

111
00:03:52,909 --> 00:03:55,969
explain a little bit about what net

112
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:57,679
neutrality is and I'm just gonna read

113
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:59,060
basically from Wikipedia and tell you

114
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,950
what wikipedia says about net neutrality

115
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:02,870
and then we'll talk a little bit about

116
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:04,339
it it says net neutrality is the

117
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:06,049
principle that Internet service

118
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:07,759
providers must treat all data on the

119
00:04:06,049 --> 00:04:10,099
internet the same and not discriminate

120
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:12,530
or charge differently by user content

121
00:04:10,099 --> 00:04:13,789
website platform application type of

122
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:16,548
attached equipment or method of

123
00:04:13,789 --> 00:04:18,259
communication for instant instance under

124
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:20,179
these principles internet service

125
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:22,279
providers are unable to intentionally

126
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:24,889
block slowdown or charge money for

127
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:26,539
specific websites and online content

128
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:28,069
gonna skip a little bit and then here's

129
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:30,560
another part that's important for us it

130
00:04:28,069 --> 00:04:32,300
says a widely cited example of a

131
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,589
violation of net neutrality principles

132
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:36,290
was the internet service provider

133
00:04:33,589 --> 00:04:38,719
Comcast secrets slowing of uploads from

134
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:42,560
peer-to-peer file sharing applications

135
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:44,570
by using forged packets Comcast did not

136
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,949
stop blocking these protocols like

137
00:04:44,569 --> 00:04:47,389
BitTorrent until the Federal

138
00:04:45,949 --> 00:04:49,790
Communications Commission ordered them

139
00:04:47,389 --> 00:04:51,620
to stop in another minor example the

140
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:55,699
Madison River communications company was

141
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:57,379
fined $15,000 by the FCC in 2004 for

142
00:04:55,699 --> 00:04:59,000
restricting their customers access to

143
00:04:57,379 --> 00:05:01,459
Vonage which was rivaling their own

144
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,319
services so basically you guys what net

145
00:05:01,459 --> 00:05:06,948
neutrality did yeah what net neutrality

146
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:09,978
did was made it illegal for folks like

147
00:05:06,949 --> 00:05:12,408
Comcast AT&amp;T Verizon or whoever else you

148
00:05:09,978 --> 00:05:14,598
can think of to alter their internet

149
00:05:12,408 --> 00:05:17,060
service based on your usage or their

150
00:05:14,598 --> 00:05:18,918
preferences right now if you live in the

151
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:20,699
United States of America and you are not

152
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:22,799
in an institution and you have public

153
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:24,389
Internet your internet is wide open you

154
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,699
were able to look at whatever you would

155
00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:29,250
like you can look at AOL you can look at

156
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:31,500
Disney you can look at Animal Planet but

157
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:33,660
also you can go to High Times comm and

158
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,279
look at cannabis you can go to your

159
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:37,230
favorite adult website and look at

160
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:38,879
whatever you're into there you can do

161
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:41,100
whatever you want on the internet right

162
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:43,409
now when net neutrality becomes a thing

163
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:45,870
your internet service provider will get

164
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:47,760
to decide what you may or may not look

165
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:49,889
at they may decide that if you want the

166
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,750
adult package if you if your content is

167
00:05:49,889 --> 00:05:53,129
considered adult if you're looking at

168
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:54,959
cannabis if you're looking at adult

169
00:05:53,129 --> 00:05:57,509
themed things if you're looking at

170
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:58,949
anything they feel may be adult they can

171
00:05:57,509 --> 00:06:00,420
put a surcharge on that for you and

172
00:05:58,949 --> 00:06:02,909
charge you money right now it's

173
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:04,710
currently illegal but now that the

174
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:06,510
restrictions have been lifted they are

175
00:06:04,709 --> 00:06:08,339
going to be allowed to do this once all

176
00:06:06,509 --> 00:06:10,980
of these rules and laws are worked out

177
00:06:08,339 --> 00:06:13,199
now what concerns me is I like giving

178
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:16,259
you guys a free podcast I like getting

179
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:18,360
my show out is it going to cost me more

180
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:20,129
money to upload my show because they

181
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:22,110
have mentioned people that use large

182
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:23,790
uploads are going to possibly have to

183
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:25,800
pay for more more for their internet

184
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:27,420
they say that people that download large

185
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,220
files may have to pay more for their

186
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:31,439
internet as your internet service

187
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:33,390
provider going to give you podcasts for

188
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:34,889
free is my internet service provider

189
00:06:33,389 --> 00:06:37,409
going to allow me to upload these

190
00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:38,729
podcasts with no extra charge those are

191
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:40,740
all things we're going to have to face

192
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:43,950
here in the future and figure out with

193
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:45,540
the changing of net neutrality now I'm

194
00:06:43,949 --> 00:06:48,060
sure a lot of companies will rally and

195
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:49,470
try to sue and hopefully somebody has a

196
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:51,750
really good lawyer and they can cert a

197
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:53,910
lawsuit to stop net neutrality from

198
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:57,209
being lifted but in other countries like

199
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:59,640
Canada and Chile and Brazil it's a thing

200
00:06:57,209 --> 00:07:01,199
and we all know that North Korea and

201
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:02,669
China are already limiting their

202
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,949
internet you can only see a few websites

203
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:06,240
there you can't access all the popular

204
00:07:04,949 --> 00:07:07,800
stuff there and if you're caught

205
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,710
accessing it you are committing a crime

206
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,329
and you will be punished so

207
00:07:10,709 --> 00:07:13,859
learn what you can from the internet

208
00:07:12,329 --> 00:07:16,859
right now you guys get what you can

209
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:18,270
because things are changing I don't know

210
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:19,710
what's coming people can't predict

211
00:07:18,269 --> 00:07:22,819
what's coming because this is a brand

212
00:07:19,709 --> 00:07:25,019
new thing but things are going to change

213
00:07:22,819 --> 00:07:26,519
you know most of the articles I read

214
00:07:25,019 --> 00:07:28,918
said that it was going to be a couple of

215
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:31,289
weeks before the changes roll out so I

216
00:07:28,918 --> 00:07:32,909
hope we don't see too drastic of a

217
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:35,520
change I hope we don't end up paying for

218
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:36,510
simple internet paying more for basic

219
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:38,279
internet we're already paying for

220
00:07:36,509 --> 00:07:40,319
Internet service I don't want to have to

221
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:42,119
pay imagine if they made it like a cable

222
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,099
package okay you can get basic internet

223
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,629
you can check out Facebook you can check

224
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:47,490
out Animal Planet you can check out all

225
00:07:45,629 --> 00:07:49,079
that but if you want to go on the

226
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:51,660
Premium Package it's gonna be an extra

227
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:53,250
nine ninety-five a month imagine if they

228
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:55,380
start doing that [ __ ] to you and then

229
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:57,569
you're not gonna know what you're not

230
00:07:55,379 --> 00:07:58,469
getting until you're not able to get it

231
00:07:57,569 --> 00:08:00,930
and then you're gonna have to add that

232
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:02,280
to your package how weird would it beats

233
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:03,780
and not have access to the whole

234
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:05,849
internet and not even know it because

235
00:08:03,779 --> 00:08:08,099
you don't know that that's there because

236
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:10,289
you can't even go to it now imagine if

237
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:11,789
you had Comcast is it okay let's even go

238
00:08:10,288 --> 00:08:14,459
better imagine if you had AT&amp;T as a

239
00:08:11,788 --> 00:08:16,439
service provider so AT&amp;T is who you pay

240
00:08:14,459 --> 00:08:18,029
your bill to AT&amp;T is who your service is

241
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:20,399
through they are the ones that get to

242
00:08:18,029 --> 00:08:22,138
decide what you get to see now perhaps

243
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:23,728
there's something really cool going on

244
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:25,800
that is sponsored by Verizon your

245
00:08:23,728 --> 00:08:27,899
favorite band is doing a cool-ass show

246
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:30,060
they're doing it live feed but it's

247
00:08:27,899 --> 00:08:32,069
sponsored by Verizon guess what [ __ ] you

248
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:33,240
AT&amp;T listeners you don't get to watch it

249
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:35,070
because you're on a different Internet

250
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:37,589
and we're not even going to allow you to

251
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:39,240
see the Verizon [ __ ] so [ __ ] you that's

252
00:08:37,589 --> 00:08:40,409
how it's gonna be people are gonna be

253
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,360
left out of stuff you're not gonna be

254
00:08:40,408 --> 00:08:44,038
able to get to see things your friend

255
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,810
with them with an iPhone and your other

256
00:08:44,038 --> 00:08:47,549
friend with an Android you're going to

257
00:08:45,809 --> 00:08:50,219
have different Internet's so you're not

258
00:08:47,549 --> 00:08:52,740
going to be able to see the same stuff

259
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:54,600
imagine this and this is just my small

260
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:56,549
mind thinking this I'm not a capitalist

261
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,769
business person but imagine when you go

262
00:08:56,549 --> 00:09:00,870
to a concert if you go to the Verizon

263
00:08:58,769 --> 00:09:02,699
Wireless Center the only internet that's

264
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:05,490
going to work there will be Verizon

265
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:08,850
Internet all the ads anything from AT&amp;T

266
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:10,830
Comcast cricket whatever else phone

267
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:12,810
companies are I don't even know all

268
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:15,690
those other ads will be blocked

269
00:09:12,809 --> 00:09:18,629
everything will just be Verizon Wireless

270
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:21,000
approved content so even and then if you

271
00:09:18,629 --> 00:09:23,009
go to the AT&amp;T or the Qualcomm Center

272
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,600
everything's gonna be filtered by them

273
00:09:23,009 --> 00:09:26,639
the internet you're allowed to use on

274
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,620
your phone while you were in the Verizon

275
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:30,659
Wireless Sentra will be filtered even

276
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:33,480
though you are an adult I'm sure they

277
00:09:30,659 --> 00:09:35,669
will filter it that way nobody can be

278
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:38,460
looking at any adult [ __ ] or any band

279
00:09:35,669 --> 00:09:41,459
[ __ ] or something from a rivaling entity

280
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:43,440
while you're in their facility that's

281
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:45,509
what this is gonna do this is just the

282
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,890
start I've got a very narrow mind when

283
00:09:45,509 --> 00:09:48,659
it comes to capitalizing on stuff like

284
00:09:46,889 --> 00:09:51,269
this I can only imagine what some folks

285
00:09:48,659 --> 00:09:52,980
in some suits and some ivory towers with

286
00:09:51,269 --> 00:09:54,809
a bunch of money are trying to do to

287
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:57,379
[ __ ] us over a little bit more right now

288
00:09:54,809 --> 00:10:00,629
so the internet may change you guys I

289
00:09:57,379 --> 00:10:03,179
didn't grow up with the Internet so to

290
00:10:00,629 --> 00:10:04,259
see the internet happen when you first

291
00:10:03,179 --> 00:10:06,299
heard about it you're like wait you

292
00:10:04,259 --> 00:10:07,529
could put your computer you plug a phone

293
00:10:06,299 --> 00:10:09,959
line in your computer and talk to other

294
00:10:07,529 --> 00:10:11,639
people on other computers sounds kind of

295
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,870
weird but it sounds kind of fun also but

296
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:14,340
also at the same time I was like I've

297
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:15,629
got a phone why do I want to type out a

298
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:17,580
bunch of [ __ ] they're like because you

299
00:10:15,629 --> 00:10:18,779
can go in a chatroom and talk to like 15

300
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:21,450
different people at once and learn a

301
00:10:18,779 --> 00:10:23,220
bunch of cool [ __ ] whoa I was like oh no

302
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:25,310
the Internet and then the internet went

303
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:27,540
from just like simple chat rooms to like

304
00:10:25,309 --> 00:10:29,579
everybody had a website and then it got

305
00:10:27,539 --> 00:10:30,779
interactive and then social media

306
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:32,460
happened

307
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:34,110
social media wasn't a thing when I was a

308
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:35,490
kid you guys all you youngsters that

309
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:37,289
wasn't a real thing I feel like grandpa

310
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:39,240
telling stories right now but social

311
00:10:37,289 --> 00:10:40,679
media wasn't a thing when I was young if

312
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,120
he wanted to find friends you need to

313
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:43,319
[ __ ] go somewhere if you wanted to

314
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,460
know what your neighbor was doing he had

315
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,020
to go there knock on the [ __ ] door

316
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:47,129
and find out what he was doing if you

317
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:48,329
wanted to know what your best friend was

318
00:10:47,129 --> 00:10:50,250
doing you had to call him go he Chris

319
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:51,570
what are you doing bro like you didn't

320
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:53,429
just jump on Facebook and see what

321
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:55,860
everybody was [ __ ] bitching about all

322
00:10:53,429 --> 00:10:56,399
at once it was way different so I saw no

323
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:59,129
internet

324
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,509
I saw chat rooms I saw all of the

325
00:10:59,129 --> 00:11:02,189
companies get a website I saw

326
00:11:00,509 --> 00:11:03,319
everybody's website suck and then I saw

327
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:05,060
everybody not

328
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:07,910
a compatible website and then I saw

329
00:11:05,059 --> 00:11:09,739
websites get good and then I saw

330
00:11:07,909 --> 00:11:11,569
everybody start openly talking about

331
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:13,669
internet porn it just became a thing and

332
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:15,260
then internet porn lost it's funny and

333
00:11:13,669 --> 00:11:16,759
it's stigma now everybody just talked

334
00:11:15,259 --> 00:11:18,439
about internet porn like it's just

335
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:20,090
common now it went from like internet

336
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:22,610
porn to now it's just internet porn

337
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:24,379
then it went to all the social media got

338
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:26,539
crazy then everybody had a YouTube

339
00:11:24,379 --> 00:11:27,470
channel and then the internet became

340
00:11:26,539 --> 00:11:29,480
what it is today

341
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:30,860
if you want to know something if you

342
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,300
have an idea it's on the internet if you

343
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:33,680
want to watch a video about something if

344
00:11:32,299 --> 00:11:35,299
you want to see somebody do something if

345
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:37,579
you want to learn about something it's

346
00:11:35,299 --> 00:11:39,019
on the Internet all of it and one of the

347
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:41,509
best parts about it was there was no

348
00:11:39,019 --> 00:11:42,949
limit because there was no rules so you

349
00:11:41,509 --> 00:11:44,689
could learn about things that you should

350
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:46,009
probably not be learning about but

351
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:47,570
you're gonna do it anyway so it's best

352
00:11:46,009 --> 00:11:49,850
to learn it the best you can so you

353
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:51,350
don't [ __ ] up but now you won't be able

354
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:52,790
to find all those cool things you won't

355
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:54,139
be able to watch all that creepy [ __ ]

356
00:11:52,789 --> 00:11:56,929
you may have to pay for a different

357
00:11:54,139 --> 00:11:59,569
package but I saw it I saw it when it

358
00:11:56,929 --> 00:12:00,109
was some creepy dark thing that had no

359
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:02,450
rules

360
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:04,490
I remember overgrow the Gov and a whole

361
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:06,200
bunch of other cannabis related websites

362
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:07,970
where we used to all go tell secrets and

363
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,379
trade seeds and try to impress each

364
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:11,180
other with our bud shots before it was

365
00:12:09,379 --> 00:12:13,059
safe to just go post your entire grow

366
00:12:11,179 --> 00:12:14,899

370
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:23,539
best to make sure that my podcast is

371
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:25,370
available in as many ways as possible as

372
00:12:23,539 --> 00:12:27,319
many places as possible as many formats

373
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:28,789
as possible in case something does

374
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,650
happen to where people are forced to pay

375

404
00:13:26,068 --> 00:13:29,849
a little bit ladies and gentlemen we are

405
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:31,860
in the era of cannabis legalization and

406
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:35,009
medical marijuana and recreational

407
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:37,740
marijuana but just because we have rules

408
00:13:35,009 --> 00:13:40,259
that allow us to dispense consume and

409
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:42,120
medicate and recreation all of the above

410
00:13:40,259 --> 00:13:44,669
with cannabis does not mean that we can

411
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:46,799
ignore the rules the rules were made the

412
00:13:44,669 --> 00:13:48,240
rules are in place and we have to follow

413
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:49,889
the rules I want to read an article that

414
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,230
I found on the cannabis this has been

415
00:13:49,889 --> 00:13:54,629
the talk of Colorado today one of the

416
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:57,060
most popular Kent's a most popular a

417
00:13:54,629 --> 00:13:59,220
very well-known a chain of dispensaries

418
00:13:57,059 --> 00:14:03,328
was raided this morning and eight

419
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:05,310
locations were raided and eleven Denver

420
00:14:03,328 --> 00:14:07,919
area sweet leaf stores were closed and

421

26 of their licenses have been suspended

422
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:12,328
I wanted to tell you guys about it I

423
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:14,639
found the article well written on the

424
00:14:12,328 --> 00:14:16,559
cannabis it is written by AH

425
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,750
Alicia Wallace from the cannabis to

426
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:20,338
staff I'm gonna read the whole article

427
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:22,350
that goes like this police raid ate

428
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:24,870
sweet leaf marijuana center locations in

429
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:26,939
Denver and Aurora all eleven Denver area

430

sweet leaf stores are closed and it's 26

431
00:14:26,938 --> 00:14:31,980
licenses have been suspended Denver

432
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:34,138
police on Thursday rated eight sweet

433
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:35,938

434
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:37,919
Denver and Aurora and arrested twelve

435
00:14:35,938 --> 00:14:40,169
people as part of a year-long

436
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:42,919
investigation into illegal marijuana

437
00:14:40,169 --> 00:14:45,539
sales yes this dispensary was

438
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:47,188
participating in allegedly I have to say

439
00:14:45,539 --> 00:14:48,629
allegedly I'm not a lawyer I wasn't

440
00:14:47,188 --> 00:14:50,610
there I'm not part of the investigation

441
00:14:48,629 --> 00:14:52,679
I can't prove [ __ ] allegedly this

442
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:55,079
dispensary was illegally selling

443
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:56,879
cannabis which could include a lot of

444
00:14:55,078 --> 00:14:58,289
things the article doesn't tell us what

445
00:14:56,879 --> 00:14:59,639
they may have been doing I will let you

446
00:14:58,289 --> 00:15:01,620
guys know what I feel like may have been

447
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:04,259
happening it goes like this the criminal

448
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:06,179
activities alleged include sale of

449
00:15:04,259 --> 00:15:08,129
cannabis and violation of the one ounce

450
00:15:06,179 --> 00:15:10,349
per person per day limits established

451
00:15:08,129 --> 00:15:12,240
under Colorado marijuana law Denver

452
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:15,778
police officials said in a statement

453
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:17,519
all right so in Colorado a recreational

454
00:15:15,778 --> 00:15:22,019
cannabis shopper is allowed to buy one

455
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:23,490
ounce per person per day now I did not

456
00:15:22,019 --> 00:15:24,959
know that it said per day because there

457
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:26,879
are some dispensaries that will let you

458
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:29,079
come back later

459
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:30,429
obviously sweetleaf was letting too many

460
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:32,020
people do that and they've gotten

461
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:33,519
themselves in trouble so I'm gonna say

462
00:15:32,019 --> 00:15:35,860
it right here if you work for a

463
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:37,449
dispensary it says clearly right here

464
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:39,370
one ounce per person per day

465
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:40,480
I don't know that Ricardo are let's see

466
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:42,759
who wrote this article again I don't

467
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:45,250
know that Alicia Wallace knows all of

468
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:46,629
the laws and rules on cannabis but it

469
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:48,580
looks like that's what got this place in

470
00:15:46,629 --> 00:15:51,669
trouble so if your dispensary is selling

471
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:53,200
is letting a customer shop drive to

472
00:15:51,669 --> 00:15:55,149
another dispensary and then come back to

473
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,860
your store or visit within the same day

474
00:15:55,149 --> 00:15:57,789
you were breaking the rules you're going

475
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:59,289
to get in trouble

476
00:15:57,789 --> 00:16:00,579
check with your compliance officer to

477
00:15:59,289 --> 00:16:01,990
check with your management and see if

478
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:03,910
this is a practice that should not be

479
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:05,789
happening in your store and if it is you

480
00:16:03,909 --> 00:16:08,289
may want to consider cutting that off

481
00:16:05,789 --> 00:16:10,569
I've seen it done I'm not gonna call out

482
00:16:08,289 --> 00:16:11,559
any dispensaries that have done it but

483
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:13,450
there are several recreational

484
00:16:11,559 --> 00:16:15,789
dispensaries that will allow you to come

485
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:17,470
back multiple times in the day and we're

486
00:16:15,789 --> 00:16:19,599
not gonna do that anymore you guys stop

487
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:21,160
that one visit per day otherwise it

488
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,659
looks sketchy there are rules in place

489
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:23,980
these people are getting trouble for

490
00:16:22,659 --> 00:16:25,959
breaking them so you're allowed to buy

491
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:28,810
one ounce per person per day and now the

492
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:31,450
criminal activities allege that these

493
00:16:28,809 --> 00:16:32,979
folks were violating that rule the

494
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:34,930
Denver Police Department of X Ison

495
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:37,840
license in concert with the police

496
00:16:34,929 --> 00:16:39,519
action suspended 26 licenses for medical

497
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:41,620
retail cultivation and extraction

498
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:43,569
operations that conduct business as

499
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:46,600
sweetleaf said Dan Rowland's spokesman

500
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:48,850
for the X ice and license department the

501
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:50,649
suspension order stated reasonable

502
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:52,629
grounds and probable cause exists to

503
00:16:50,649 --> 00:16:54,429
believe that respondents have engaged in

504
00:16:52,629 --> 00:16:56,669
deliberate and willful violations of

505
00:16:54,429 --> 00:16:59,229
state and local laws or regulations and

506
00:16:56,669 --> 00:17:02,649
and/or that the public health safety and

507
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:04,000
welfare requires emergency action at

508
00:17:02,649 --> 00:17:05,349
this point in the articles I'm scrolling

509
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,299
through there's a picture of the door at

510
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:09,039
sweetleaf with a nice little handwritten

511
00:17:07,299 --> 00:17:11,440
note that says sorry we are closed and

512
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:12,789
then a very well printed letter from

513
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:14,799
it's hard to read because it's kind of

514
00:17:12,789 --> 00:17:17,170
small it says City and County of Denver

515
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:18,460
Department of X ice and taxes with the

516
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:21,430
big Denver official logo

517
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:23,049
notice of suspension and bright red then

518
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:25,210
the following text is in black it says

519
00:17:23,049 --> 00:17:27,159
medical and/or retail marijuana licenses

520
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:28,840
for these premises have been suspended

521
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:31,509
by order of the Denver department of

522
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:33,970

523
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:36,069
or for alleged violations of Colorado

524
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:38,170
law and that is prominently displayed on

525
00:17:36,069 --> 00:17:39,919
the front door it sweet leaf dispensary

526
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:41,840
and it is the location at 20

527
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,980
6:09 Walnut Street is where this photo

528
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:44,689

529
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:46,039

533
00:17:50,619 --> 00:17:54,769
so the article goes on to say like this

534
00:17:52,849 --> 00:17:56,480
all sweetleaf stores in Colorado ten in

535
00:17:54,769 --> 00:17:59,119
denver and one in aurora were closed

536
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,890
thursday names of the 12 people arrested

537
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:02,809

538
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:04,700
being booked into the downtown detention

539
00:18:02,809 --> 00:18:06,649
center police said the operation was

540
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:08,180
conducted after a criminal investigation

541
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:10,820
into the illegal distribution of

542
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:12,529
marijuana at eight locations the alleged

543
00:18:10,819 --> 00:18:14,659
criminal violations were related to the

544
00:18:12,529 --> 00:18:17,509
sale of marijuana in excess of allowable

545
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:19,490
amounts established by amendment 64

546
00:18:17,509 --> 00:18:20,119
which allows for the personal use of

547
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:22,759
marijuana

548
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:25,069
according to police department news

549
00:18:22,759 --> 00:18:26,390
release no other marijuana businesses

550
00:18:25,069 --> 00:18:28,429
were included in the rates the police

551
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:29,780
said sweetleaf representatives said in

552
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:32,390
an e-mailed statement that they were

553
00:18:29,779 --> 00:18:34,069
surprised by police raids it is unclear

554
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:36,590
at this point exactly what actions if

555
00:18:34,069 --> 00:18:38,179
any sweetleaf took to cause the city to

556
00:18:36,589 --> 00:18:39,709
issue this order the statement said

557
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:41,330
sweetleaf is cooperating with the

558
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:43,190
authorities to resolve this issue and

559
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:44,149
hopes to have all of their stores back

560
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:46,190
in operation

561
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:48,290
as soon as possible it was not

562
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:50,029

563
00:18:48,289 --> 00:18:51,859
leaves facilities were affected beyond

564
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:53,629

coordinated enforcement action was

602
00:20:03,809 --> 00:20:07,799
solely a Colorado agency effort headed

603
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:09,660

operation spokesman Randy Ladd said and

614
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:30,779

00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:52,500
right ela TI street and 7200 East Smith

621
00:20:48,869 --> 00:20:53,819
Road so I was right right in my

622
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,930
assumption they were selling more

623
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:57,629
cannabis than they should have been

624
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:59,130
selling to each customer so you guys

625
00:20:57,630 --> 00:21:00,480
check this out if you are not from

626
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:02,400
Colorado or even if you are from

627
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,750
Colorado and you go to a dispensary and

628
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,160
you're that guy that's like and you're

629
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:07,170
shopping recreationally or even

630
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:10,230
medically and you're asking somebody to

631
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:11,610
bend or break a rule and you are a dick

632
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:12,960
because they won't break the rules

633
00:21:11,609 --> 00:21:15,599
because they are a well-trained

634
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,970
trustworthy employee this is why they

635
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:20,369
are not breaking the rules these guys

636
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:21,480
lost eight dispensaries let's see I want

637
00:21:20,369 --> 00:21:24,689
to scroll up and read how many licenses

638
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:27,539
they lost cuz it was crazy eight places

639
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:30,740
got raided eleven stores were closed and

640
00:21:27,539 --> 00:21:32,819
26 licenses have been suspended because

641
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:35,910
somebody in this company said that it

642
00:21:32,819 --> 00:21:38,460
was okay to break rules and create major

643
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:41,640
violations now the whole company is

644
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:43,440
being shut down everybody from the

645
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:45,480
growers to the trimmers to the bud

646
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,279
tenders to the managers to the CEOs

647
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:49,140
they're all on hold right now there

648
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:50,730
might not be a business nobody knows

649
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:52,200
what's going on with these licenses

650
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:53,700
until they have their hearings usually

651
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:56,009
these hearings happen within I think

652
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:57,509
it's about 30 days they have to be heard

653
00:21:56,009 --> 00:22:00,029
and everybody goes to court and talks

654
00:21:57,509 --> 00:22:01,589
about this but until this happens the

655
00:22:00,029 --> 00:22:02,970
growers don't know where their paycheck

656
00:22:01,589 --> 00:22:04,149
comes from the trimmers don't know where

657
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:06,430
their paycheck comes from

658
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:08,170
everyone's in the in a scramble so they

659
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:09,759
got greedy they tried to make extra

660
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:11,940
money they tried to break some rules and

661
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:14,890
all they did was totally [ __ ] themselves

662
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:17,049
26 licenses you guys licenses are not

663
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:19,270
cheap if you [ __ ] up with the license

664
00:22:17,049 --> 00:22:21,159
and they find out they find that you

665
00:22:19,269 --> 00:22:22,839
were incapable of properly handling a

666
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:24,640
license and conducting business like an

667
00:22:22,839 --> 00:22:26,259
adult they will take your [ __ ]

668
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,610
license from you and I don't know what

669
00:22:26,259 --> 00:22:28,809
happens to it they sell it or you have

670
00:22:27,609 --> 00:22:30,099
to sell it to somebody else or something

671
00:22:28,809 --> 00:22:32,349
but you're not allowed to hold a

672
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:34,029
marijuana license a business license for

673
00:22:32,349 --> 00:22:37,569
any type of cannabis related business

674
00:22:34,029 --> 00:22:38,619
anymore they can do that who knows

675
00:22:37,569 --> 00:22:40,389
what's gonna happen with these

676
00:22:38,619 --> 00:22:42,189
businesses who knows there are bud

677
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:44,530
tenders that are not at work there's a

678
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:45,880
one location open tomorrow and I don't

679
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:47,349
know that those employees are gonna want

680
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:49,750
to go to work they're probably paranoid

681
00:22:47,349 --> 00:22:52,449
and worried they know there's a whole

682
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:56,109
company shutdown millions of dollars you

683
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:57,580
guys millions of dollars millions I

684
00:22:56,109 --> 00:22:59,559
don't I couldn't even fathom how many

685
00:22:57,579 --> 00:23:02,079
millions of dollars come with 26

686
00:22:59,559 --> 00:23:03,970
licenses so they say eight sweetleaf

687
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:06,279
marijuana Center locations there's 8

688
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:08,740
locations shut down but there are 26

689
00:23:06,279 --> 00:23:10,899
licenses which means there are eight

690
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:13,859
dispensaries there probably 10 grows

691
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:16,120
that puts it 18 and then like maybe 8

692
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:17,859
MIPS which would be where they make

693
00:23:16,119 --> 00:23:20,500
edibles or where they make concentrates

694
00:23:17,859 --> 00:23:22,869
mips is medically infused products is

695
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:24,940
what that license is MIP and that's

696
00:23:22,869 --> 00:23:26,529
where you can do extractions it they're

697
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:28,960
all specialized it's either a kitchen or

698
00:23:26,529 --> 00:23:31,839
a lab or whatever but so yeah they

699
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,610
probably had eight dispensaries 10 grows

700
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:36,009
it puts you at 18 and then however

701
00:23:33,609 --> 00:23:37,419
whatever else I said eight more would be

702
00:23:36,009 --> 00:23:39,129
MIPS or whatever I'm just guessing I

703
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:41,529
don't know what they really are but 26

704
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:42,880
licenses have been taken away so many

705
00:23:41,529 --> 00:23:44,139
people are gonna be [ __ ] you guys so

706
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,880
when you go to the dispensary and the

707
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:47,590
budtender won't break the rules or won't

708
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,970
bend the rules or won't sell you extra

709
00:23:47,589 --> 00:23:51,099
or won't hook you up or you don't have

710
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:52,509
the proper ID and they tell you no this

711
00:23:51,099 --> 00:23:53,829
is why you guys we would like to keep

712
00:23:52,509 --> 00:23:55,930
our businesses we would like to be

713
00:23:53,829 --> 00:23:57,460
employed it is the middle of December

714
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:58,810
and now there are a bunch of people that

715
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:00,130
we're probably counting on that next

716
00:23:58,809 --> 00:24:01,029
paycheck that they're gonna make over

717
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:02,680
the next week

718
00:24:01,029 --> 00:24:04,450
to cover some Christmas gifts to cover

719
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:05,740
something people already spent money I'm

720
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:07,059
sure because it's Christmas time and

721
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:08,710
we're [ __ ] humans we don't plan ahead

722
00:24:07,059 --> 00:24:10,419
we just spend money that we don't have

723
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:12,490
because the TV tells us that it's okay

724
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:14,019
because just spend that money and so

725
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:15,099
they did I bet you they did now these

726
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:15,759
people are gonna be [ __ ] because they

727
00:24:15,099 --> 00:24:18,759
don't have a job

728
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:20,950
so stop breaking the rules stop asking

729
00:24:18,759 --> 00:24:23,049
people to break rules and look here is

730
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:24,430
an example there are rules in Colorado

731
00:24:23,049 --> 00:24:26,440
we're not just it's not the Wild West

732
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:27,970
anymore for you people that may think

733
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,750
we're just out here slinging dope and

734
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:31,329
nobody cares

735
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:33,880
there are rules doors got kicked in

736
00:24:31,329 --> 00:24:35,949
licenses were taken away people are in

737
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:37,420
jail alright I've got one more little

738
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:39,580
piece I want to add to this before I

739
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:42,730
wrap up this segment of the show this

740
00:24:39,579 --> 00:24:44,619
was from the westward which is uh if

741
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:46,240
you're not from Colorado the westward is

742
00:24:44,619 --> 00:24:49,989
like a little local paper it's the hip

743
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:51,279
cool color paper with all the ads in it

744
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:52,690
and all the local stuff it tells you

745
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:53,649
about all the cool shows coming up it

746
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:56,230
tells you about all the art that's

747
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:58,000
happening and then the back three pages

748
00:24:56,230 --> 00:25:00,670
are all ads and coupons for dispensaries

749
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,740
in Denver but they put out a great

750
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:06,460
magazine I think monthly and they also

751
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:08,740
have a website and sweetleaf sent them a

752
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:11,799
message and it's an official assert a

753
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:13,509
ssin from corporate and westward posted

754
00:25:11,799 --> 00:25:15,279
it and it says this morning sweet leaf

755
00:25:13,509 --> 00:25:16,900
was surprised to receive notification

756
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:19,240
from the from the department of excise

757
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:21,160
and license suspending all of our city

758
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:23,079
licenses in the City and County of

759
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:25,120
Denver it is unclear at this point

760
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:27,250
exactly what actions if any sweet leaf

761
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:29,259
took to cause the city to issue this

762
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:30,940
order sweet leaf is cooperating with the

763
00:25:29,259 --> 00:25:32,559
authorities to resolve this issue and

764
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:36,460
hopes to have all of their stores back

765
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:37,809
in operation as soon as possible yeah it

766
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:39,400
said that they were cooperating of

767
00:25:37,809 --> 00:25:41,649
course they're cooperating twelve people

768
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:42,130
are in jail now I'm curious are those

769
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:44,380
people

770
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:46,540
owners are they corporate it doesn't say

771
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:48,040
I've been researching everything I can

772
00:25:46,539 --> 00:25:49,960
find so far at the time of this

773
00:25:48,039 --> 00:25:51,789
recording the people arrested have not

774
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:53,319
been processed they are still in booking

775
00:25:51,789 --> 00:25:54,759
in the Denver jail the Denver I don't

776
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:56,559
know the Denver City Denver County Jail

777
00:25:54,759 --> 00:25:58,720
they're still being processed so I can't

778
00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:00,609
find any information on who it was what

779
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,559
I'm curious about is where they bud

780
00:26:00,609 --> 00:26:04,629
tenders where they manage me where they

781
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:07,299
owners were they where were they in the

782
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:10,150
food chain of the company because

783
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:12,309
honestly I don't know I know there is a

784
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:14,320
rule in place and I have to ask we got

785
00:26:12,309 --> 00:26:16,179
to get white Mike in on this one there's

786
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:17,500
a rule that says if somebody commits a

787
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:19,390
crime in the dispensary that it's either

788
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:21,369
the management's responsibility or the

789
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:22,540
actual like if a budtender sells

790
00:26:21,369 --> 00:26:24,099
somebody illegally

791
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:26,470
I think the budtender can actually

792
00:26:24,099 --> 00:26:29,409
legally be held responsible but I'm not

793
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:31,839
certain so I think the bud tenders made

794
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:34,420
the ones detained I'm not sure when I

795
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:36,669
find out I will let you guys know on a

796
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:38,529
future episode all right so I took a

797
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:40,120
second and contacted a compliance

798
00:26:38,529 --> 00:26:41,889
officer who knows a lot about the

799
00:26:40,119 --> 00:26:43,959
marijuana Enforcement Division rules and

800
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:45,700
regulations and they told me yes if a

801
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:48,160
budtender is caught violating a rule

802
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:49,750
they will be arrested and charged but

803
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:51,580
they also stated they doubt that's what

804
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:52,960
happened in this case they said there's

805
00:26:51,579 --> 00:26:54,759
more to this case that they can't talk

806
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,079
about right now and they will talk to me

807
00:26:54,759 --> 00:26:58,720
in person because we were just texting

808
00:26:56,079 --> 00:27:00,159
so they're an insider they're in the

809
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,259
industry they know a lot of people I'll

810
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:04,570
find out some stuff and then I'll see

811
00:27:02,259 --> 00:27:06,160
what I can share with you but it is not

812
00:27:04,569 --> 00:27:07,569
what it looks like is what I can say

813
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:09,490
after reading that whole article and

814
00:27:07,569 --> 00:27:11,649
then talking with my friend it doesn't

815
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:13,690
appear to be what it looks like this is

816
00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:15,580
a different thing than what I thought

817
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:17,799
and what the reporters have all said so

818
00:27:15,579 --> 00:27:19,269
far so I'll find out if there's anything

819
00:27:17,799 --> 00:27:20,740
else I can share with you guys and then

820
00:27:19,269 --> 00:27:23,049
I will let you know as soon as I've got

821
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:24,370
some more information all right I'm

822
00:27:23,049 --> 00:27:25,839
running out of time and my throat is

823
00:27:24,369 --> 00:27:27,639
starting to get a little bit funky but I

824
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:29,619
want to read one email and then we're

825
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:30,790
going to wrap up this podcast I know

826
00:27:29,619 --> 00:27:32,859
there wasn't a whole lot of very

827
00:27:30,789 --> 00:27:34,809
specific cannabis education this time

828
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:36,849
but the theme of the show is cannabis

829
00:27:34,809 --> 00:27:38,980
news education and conversation you've

830
00:27:36,849 --> 00:27:42,059
got some news and conversation for sure

831
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:45,610

832
00:27:42,059 --> 00:27:47,379
education based so we're evening [ __ ]

864

865
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:56,289

866
00:28:53,079 --> 00:28:58,000

867
00:28:56,289 --> 00:28:59,950
goat won't be available for a long time

868
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,720
the lemon Geoffrey is not available by

869
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:04,450
itself but it is available in the form

870
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:05,950

871
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:07,750
crossed to the arrives so that's

872
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:10,150
available at the dank team and the hell

873
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:11,890
a dank seed bank the email goes on to

874
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:13,150
say I know you recently mentioned that

875
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:14,950
you don't care the massive feminized

876
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:16,540
seeds but if there are any feminized

877
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:19,019
seeds of these strains floating around I

878
00:29:16,539 --> 00:29:22,178
would like to get my hands on them ah

879
00:29:19,019 --> 00:29:23,889
there are no more golden goat or lemon

880
00:29:22,179 --> 00:29:26,440
Jeffrey feminized seeds available right

881
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:28,900
now that may change in the future but

882
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:30,910
currently that's not a thing a rise is

883
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:33,548
currently not available in a feminized

884
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:37,840
seed form so no feminized seeds right

885
00:29:33,548 --> 00:29:39,910
now from me although I will be making a

886
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:41,918
new line of feminized seeds very soon

887
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:44,380
I'm going to reverse a male a female

888
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:46,600
plant and turn it into a male I'm gonna

889
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:48,580
pollinate a few things I will test run

890
00:29:46,599 --> 00:29:50,349
those if I like what comes out of those

891
00:29:48,579 --> 00:29:51,970
I will do it again and put it into

892
00:29:50,349 --> 00:29:53,439
production I was asked to do a favor for

893
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:55,029
somebody because they really liked a

894
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,308
strain and they wanted to play with

895
00:29:55,029 --> 00:29:59,079
seeds of it so I am going to make s ones

896
00:29:57,308 --> 00:30:01,480
of a strain I'll talk about it a little

897
00:29:59,079 --> 00:30:02,829
more in the future but that's that's

898
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:04,839
what I'm doing with feminized seeds I've

899
00:30:02,829 --> 00:30:06,490
got a whole new plant that I'm going to

900
00:30:04,839 --> 00:30:08,230
be reversing I'm going to make a whole

901
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:10,450
new line of FEM stuff there will only be

902
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:12,308
about four or five crosses in the whole

903
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:13,929
line but those will be coming in a

904
00:30:12,308 --> 00:30:15,970
little bit here I'm gonna get back to

905
00:30:13,929 --> 00:30:18,940
this email and get my brain back focused

906
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:20,940
he says I hope to hear back from you and

907
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:23,200
keep up the good work on the podcast

908
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:24,789
hey thanks I'll keep up the good work I

909
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,169
apologize for taking forever

910
00:30:24,789 --> 00:30:29,230
to get back to you with the emails I've

911
00:30:26,169 --> 00:30:31,480
got a lot of emails obviously the email

912
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:33,069
goes on to say I lost my space here we

913
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:36,220
go it is by far one of my top three

914
00:30:33,069 --> 00:30:38,649
right alongside Joe Rogan experience Wow

915
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:40,058
I'm in the top three right alongside Joe

916
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:41,980
Rogan so who else is up there I wonder

917
00:30:40,058 --> 00:30:43,539
who number three is it's Joe Rogan

918
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:46,058
myself and who else do you have up there

919
00:30:43,539 --> 00:30:48,369
I'm very curious and on it honestly it's

920
00:30:46,058 --> 00:30:50,740
an honor every time somebody compares me

921
00:30:48,369 --> 00:30:52,029
to Joe Rogan in podcasting or in any way

922
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:53,829
shape or form it's a [ __ ] honor

923
00:30:52,029 --> 00:30:55,849
because Joe Rogan is an amazing

924
00:30:53,829 --> 00:30:57,740
individual that man's a sad

925
00:30:55,849 --> 00:30:59,119
there's never an insult to be compared

926
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:01,220
to Joe Rogan so thank you for that huge

927
00:30:59,119 --> 00:31:02,629
compliment I'm glad that my podcast is

928
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:05,659
one of your favorites right alongside

929
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:07,789
Joe Rogan I listen to Joe Rogan kind of

930
00:31:05,659 --> 00:31:09,860
religiously Rogan puts out three

931
00:31:07,788 --> 00:31:12,740
sometimes four or five shows every week

932
00:31:09,859 --> 00:31:15,199
and I listen to almost every second of

933
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:16,700
every show that that guy puts out that's

934
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,929
one of my favorite podcast so I'm glad

935
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:19,460
you dig it with me I'm glad we're

936
00:31:17,929 --> 00:31:21,288
probably listening to the Joe Rogan

937
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:23,419
experience together sometimes during

938
00:31:21,288 --> 00:31:24,200

939

942

943
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:36,169

944
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:38,298
