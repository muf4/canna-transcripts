intro track all right you do know i like

56
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,000
to start the podcast off by talking

57
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:56,560
about what i'm smoking

58
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,478
today i've been taking dabs of hella

59
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,399
tight live batter from green dot labs

60
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:02,478
this is a blend of sex on the beach and

61
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,000
peach wrecker the flavor is described as

62
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:05,438
sour and star fruit

63
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,080
i think we've talked about this on the

64
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:10,318
podcast before it's certainly sour

65
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,000
there's a sweet funky fruitness going on

66
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:14,318
and there's another terp that is almost

67
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,878
sour that i cannot quite describe

68
00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:17,958
i really enjoy it the package says it

69
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:21,679

breeding project update if you've been

131
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:04,719
following the show

132
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,799
you know that i've been working with a

133
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:08,080
jack the ripper male i acquired some

134
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,760
jack the ripper seeds

135
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,519
out of that package of seeds i did find

136
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:13,280
a very quality male plant

137
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,799
i was very pleased with his aroma his

138
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,120
structure his shape

139
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,959
his flowering time when he started to

140
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,560
flower he smelled a little bit like

141
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,319
lime vomit like if you had too many

142
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,280
margaritas and threw up that's almost

143
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:25,120
what he sounded like

144
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:26,399
smelled like i know that sounds like a

145
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,240
disgusting flavor

146
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:29,758
disgusting flavors are beautiful when it

147
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,280
comes to breeding and selecting male

148
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,639
plants for cannabis breeding

149
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:37,119
so i've got the margarita lime sort of a

150
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,800
key lime pie vomit flavored male plant

151
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,199
with a beautiful structure he made a lot

152
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,478
of pollen he pollinated really well he

153
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,280
had a beautiful flower shape and

154
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:45,519
structure

155
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:46,959
i used him to pollinate several other

156
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:48,719
females in that room

157
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:50,399
where a couple of other jack the ripper

158
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,840
females number two and four were my

159
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:52,799
favorites i can't decide which one was

160
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:55,359
the best so

161
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,199
numbers two and four got pollinated uh

162
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,479
something i've noticed quite randomly

163
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:02,400
two and four if i plant ten five

164
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:03,839
twenty five seeds numbers two and four

165
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:05,359
and i don't number them

166
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:07,198
and they they get numbered before

167
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,160
anything happens i put ten seeds down

168
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,319
i'll label them one

169
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,600
two three four five two and four are

170
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:12,800
always [ __ ] killers i don't know how

171
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,199
it works out that way

172
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,639
always keepers always champions uh but i

173
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,240
kept number two and four of the jack the

174
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,600
ripper what else is in there there was a

175
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,439
platinum tangy in there

176
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,520
there was a golden goat female in there

177
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:26,000
there was a blueberry cookies in there

178
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:28,159
there was a lemon skunk in there and i

179
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,199
put a morning dew plant in there but for

180
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,439
some reason

181
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,280
the morning dude did not make very many

182
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:35,038
seeds it was right in the line of pollen

183
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:36,559
it got skeet skeeted on all over it

184
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:38,959
should have made a lot of seeds

185
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,120
not very many seeds the arise also did

186
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:41,758
not make it made some but not a lot of

187
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,680
seeds

188
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,360
i got a [ __ ] ton of seeds from the jack

189
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,160
the ripper females and the blueberry

190
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,160
cookies

191
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,919
but a couple of them did not make the

192
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,280
desired amount of seeds not a big deal

193
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:52,879
these weren't meant to be a production

194
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:53,758
cross there's no profit to be made off

195
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:55,439
of these seeds

196
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,199
these will be testers these will be sent

197
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:58,959
out to friends i'll grow them

198
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,639
we'll see if they're worth a [ __ ] we'll

199
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:02,159
grow all these out find out if we made

200
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,639
gems or if we made turds

201
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,960
if it's something i feel is worth

202
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,639
contributing to the future of cannabis

203
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:10,560
then we may release those seeds

204
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,840
through the vendors through other forums

205
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,280
uh they may be available

206
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:14,239
uh however you get my seeds you know

207
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:15,679
where to get them if you're getting them

208
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,800
now uh you'll be able to find those

209
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,079
seeds there but that will be a while

210
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,199
we've gotta test them we gotta run them

211
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:20,000
and make sure they're worth the crap i

212
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,759
don't want to take your

213
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,360
money until i've tested these and make

214
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,038
sure that they're quality quality seeds

215
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,960
that's part of my job as a breeder

216
00:06:25,038 --> 00:06:28,639
to verify what i've got i don't want to

217
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:30,159
give you some some junk that you're not

218
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,759
going to be completely happy with i want

219
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,680
to set you up for success

220
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,360
as much as i set myself up for success

221
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,038
so that's kind of an update

222
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,160
um where was i with the update i didn't

223
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:38,719
even give you an update i've been

224
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,560
breeding

225
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,919
i pollinated all those plants guess what

226
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,519
they've been harvested they're chopped

227
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:45,279
down they are drying

228
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:46,879
the way i do it is i cut the plants down

229
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:47,359
i let them hang for several days until

230
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:49,680
they are

231
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,199
crispy dry then i put them in a like a

232
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,840
storage container like a rubbermaid

233
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,280
container

234
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:55,119
i put on some rubber gloves and while

235
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:56,559
they're over the container i just grind

236
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,038
them up with my hands like this just

237
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,879
mush

238
00:06:57,038 --> 00:07:00,240
mush mush and you can hear the seeds

239
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:01,918
fall out into the container

240
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,680
i pull out all the big sticks the sticks

241
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:05,198
go in the trash or the bokashi bin or

242
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,598
the compost pile depending on

243
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,639
what we got going on at the time then

244
00:07:07,598 --> 00:07:11,680
i've got a

245
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,240
easy seed seed sorting machine once all

246
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,680
that

247
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,680
seed rolls to one end and all the

248
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,120
material is super dry i'll run all of

249
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,639
that through an easy seed sorting

250
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,879
machine it will pull all the chaff

251
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:23,038
from the seed i've got one pile of seeds

252
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:24,959
one pile of wasteful material

253
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:26,399
that'll go probably in a compost bin or

254
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:27,758
in a bokashi bucket

255
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:29,918
sometimes it goes right in the trash to

256
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,439
be quite honest with you but try to be

257
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:33,359
less wasteful do what i can with that

258
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:35,360
stuff that'll get sorted out

259
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,120
that will happen here hopefully over the

260
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,479
next few days i've been tied up with a

261
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,399
couple other projects i got a lot of

262
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:41,758
good things going on i'm not complaining

263
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:43,120
been doing a couple other things once i

264
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,319
get caught up we'll get those seeds all

265
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,319
sorted

266
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,840
my my update is that they're harvested

267
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,280
there aren't as many seeds and some as i

268
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:51,119
hoped for there are way more seeds than

269
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:53,038
i anticipated and some of them

270
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,800
i will get them out to some testers and

271
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:56,478
we will get some reports back to you as

272
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,879
soon as possible i need to germinate

273
00:07:56,478 --> 00:07:58,318
some

274
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,080
i like to be ahead of the testers i

275
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,560
don't want my testers flowering before

276
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:02,240
me

277
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,839
so i want to get ahead i want to get a

278
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,000
some germ time going some

279
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:07,119
veg time going once i'm into flour then

280
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,478
i'll probably send some out to some

281
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,038
other people let them run them see what

282
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:10,639
they've got

283
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:11,918
but that is the update on the jack the

284
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,439
rippers everyone's gonna ask what

285
00:08:11,918 --> 00:08:14,079
happened to the jtr you quit talking

286
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:15,439
about it

287
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:17,598
i quit talking about it because every

288
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:19,680
time i mention it i get

289
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:21,360
a hundred emails asking if people can

290
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,360
test those jack the rippers

291
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,038
not yet coming soon you guys let me grow

292
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,000
them let me play with them first once i

293
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:27,839
get them packaged up

294
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,519
sorted cleaned up all that good stuff

295
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:31,758
then i will offer some testers

296
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:33,278
uh the best way to be a tester some

297
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,639
criteria i will look for

298
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:36,240
is i want to see your social media

299
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:37,199
photography what are you posting on

300
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,278
social media

301
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,640
what kind of grow do you have what kind

302
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:42,240
of photos do you take

303
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:44,319
a lot of times when i'm having people

304
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,000
grow testers your photos become the

305
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,600
photos that land on the website because

306
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,879
i need a good quality photo

307
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,959
sometimes you guys find a better

308
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:52,480
phenotype than i do that's not uncommon

309
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:54,159
sometimes you guys find gems sometimes

310
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,159
you get a really solid photo

311
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:57,519
i love that keep doing that [ __ ] but i

312
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:59,120
need someone that can take good photos

313
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,159
they can take reliable notes they can

314
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,320
communicate well

315
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:03,759
people don't that don't disappear a lot

316
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,200
of people say i want to be a tester and

317
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:07,200
you send them seeds and guess what

318
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,800
they were not testers they were [ __ ]

319
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,399
a charitable cause they got a set of

320
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:12,639
free seeds out of me and they never

321
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,000
talked talked to me contacted me again

322
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:15,519
they're out there growing fire

323
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,360
probably renamed it made their own

324
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,480
strain out of it made seeds out of it

325
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,200
who knows what could happen at that

326
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,720
point but

327
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,080
i need people that are cool not dicks

328
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,360
people that i can rely on people that

329
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,278
will communicate with me

330
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,399
so a good way to up your chances are to

331
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:28,799
be on cannabis

332
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,559
and or instagram cannabis is a big bonus

333
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:31,679
i'm trying to build a large community on

334
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:32,159

they'll get seeds like i said and they

356
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,799
never talk to me again that's insulting

357
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:09,200
hurts my feelings

399
00:11:14,078 --> 00:11:17,838

414
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:43,278
need to check out a social media because

415

i see so many terrible questions and

416
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:46,559
there aren't bad questions just things

417
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:48,240
you should have read like day one [ __ ]

418
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:49,518
and you're on day like 37 and you

419
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,320
already have a problem you didn't even

420
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,480
know about

421
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,320
let me get focused here are some of the

422
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,879
books that i will recommend

423
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,440
i will recommend any books by an author

424
00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:00,720
named

425
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:03,920
greg greene greg green is an amazing

426
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:06,000
cannabis author also everything by

427
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:08,000
robert connell clark robert connell

428
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,039
clark will go deep into a cannabis and

429
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,440
cultivation

430
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:12,879
education you will learn a lot you may

431
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,320
have to read these books a couple of

432
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:16,399
times don't be shy

433
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,160
read a chapter go back read that chapter

434
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,600
again read another chapter go back and

435
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:21,039
read them both again

436
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,639
you're not in a hurry to read these

437
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:24,480
books it's not a rush

438
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:25,919
get this knowledge in your brain learn

439
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,240
it have a good foundation

440
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:29,759
then move on and as you're reading some

441
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,039
stuff may not make sense but

442
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:33,278
a couple chapters later you're going to

443
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:34,480
go oh wait i just saw the magic trick

444
00:12:33,278 --> 00:12:36,559
and it all will kind of

445
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,079
unveil itself and it will make sense so

446
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:39,679
read the robert connell clark books

447
00:12:38,078 --> 00:12:41,278
they're intense they're in depth

448
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:43,039
uh it's a lot to read but you're gonna

449
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:45,519
learn so much from there then

450
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:47,838
i also recommend jorge cervantes books

451
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:50,879
people are gonna go oh he said jorge

452
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:51,600
jorge is an older grower a lot of what

453
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:54,799
he says

454
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,399
will be uh timely uh no

455
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:57,838
outdated maybe the word that i'm

456
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,839
avoiding but

457
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,279
a lot of his technology is old a lot of

458
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,440
it is from back in the day

459
00:13:01,278 --> 00:13:04,399
also that [ __ ] works it's a very good

460
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,000
foundation

461
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,679
it doesn't cost a lot of money to grow

462
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,039
with jorge cervantes methods

463
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:11,120
it doesn't take a lot of science and

464
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:12,159
technology to run his methods and this

465
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,399
[ __ ] works

466
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:16,799
so that is a good resource jorge

467
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,879
cervantes is a very good place to start

468
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:20,639
when it comes with cannabis books also

469
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:22,000
another guy that is very popular in the

470
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,159
authoring space when it comes to

471
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,360
cannabis is ed rosenthal

472
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:26,958
many people are going to turn their

473
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,759
noses up to the fact that i said ed

474
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:29,679
rosenthal

475
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:31,600
because again his stuff is a little

476
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:34,719
outdated he's from back in the day

477
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:37,200
but he's got a very solid foundation

478
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,959
for cannabis education i haven't read a

479
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,480
jorge book or an ed book in a minute

480
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:42,159
the last books were kind of old school

481
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,879
maybe they have evolved don't let me put

482
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:44,078
them down

483
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:46,240
i'm just saying those guys are a little

484
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:48,000
bit older they're not they may not be up

485
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,959
with all the modern [ __ ] but the stuff

486
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,600
they put out will never stop being

487
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:54,479
relevant

488
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,839
and useful that is good quality info i

489
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,120
will support i haven't read everything

490
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,160
they've said but i'll support most of

491
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,480
what those guys say

492
00:13:58,159 --> 00:14:02,000
and it will still be useful in 20 years

493
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,240
so those guys are great books

494
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,440
great authors to read books from we've

495
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,600
got greg greene

496
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:10,079
robert connell clark clark with an e

497
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,519
robert connell clark c-l-a-r-k-e if

498
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:13,679
you're looking for the book marijuana

499
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:15,759

00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:27,120
i enjoy it i think it is quite useful

507
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:29,679
it's a very good resource for

508
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,480
all growers on all levels another book i

509
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:33,120
would recommend

510
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,879
is uh from drew west secrets of the west

511
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,039
coast masters by drew west

512
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:38,720
uh kind of a secretive book not a lot of

513
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:39,599
people knew about that is a good book i

514
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,000
like that

515
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,879
there's a breeder by the name of soma

516
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,559
soma is from

517
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:46,000
he's from jacksonville florida if i get

518
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:48,559
my facts right but

519
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,320
eventually soma ended up in amsterdam

520
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:51,919
soma is a very well-known breeder

521
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,600
well-known grower has been part of the

522
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:55,039
cannabis industry for a long time

523
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,199
was a big part of all the high times

524
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:58,399
cannabis cups soma has written a book

525
00:14:57,198 --> 00:14:59,919
that i enjoy

526
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,600
when you start reading about soma and

527
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:03,679
you know who soma is you'll see

528
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,278
my connection to soma he's a dreadlocked

529
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:06,239
white guy he's into the same sort of

530
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:08,799
vibes as me

531
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,000
big shout out to soma i like his stuff

532
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:12,000
um

533
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,278
another book that you might want to read

534
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,078
i'm writing down another one because i

535
00:15:13,278 --> 00:15:15,919
forgot one

536
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:18,638
another author you need a book from is

537
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:20,958
dj short dj short put out a small book

538
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:22,480
uh him and soma both put out very small

539
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:24,159
very short grow books

540
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,000
uh they didn't put all the details in

541
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:27,039
there that jorge and ed put in there but

542
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,120
they put their

543
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:30,799
little tricks and these little tricks

544
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,480
that each grower develops along the way

545
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:33,120
is how a grower will develop their own

546
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,120
style

547
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,799
their own niche like if you think about

548
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,320
bands they're all playing drums bass

549
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:39,599
guitar maybe some keyboards they're all

550
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,000
doing the same [ __ ] they're all counting

551
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,920
to four

552
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,519
playing chords but just the little

553
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:44,958
things that they've picked up along the

554
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:47,120
way or what makes a band different where

555
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:49,198
they're from what they did what they saw

556
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,959
that's going to affect you as a grower

557
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:53,359
and i think that the book by soma

558
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:54,000
and dj short are very niche books by

559
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,399
growers with

560
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
very established reputations uh very

561
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,440
established spots in the community

562
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,198
you can learn a lot from them they

563
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,639
didn't need to make a big thick book

564
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:04,719
just their thick book with a couple of

565
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:07,600
very cool tricks in it will suffice

566
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,720
from them so uh soma and dj short are

567
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,879
the next two i'll recommend

568
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,560
then there's a guy known as the rev the

569
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:14,399
rev has written a lot of books

570
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:16,559
uh check out the books by the rev i

571
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,958
think the rev i should check my sources

572
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:20,078
i'm pretty sure the rev wrote uh teaming

573
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:21,838
with microbes

574
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:24,078
and true living organics we're gonna

575
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:26,880
make sure that that's correct true

576
00:16:24,078 --> 00:16:28,679
living not loving that's a different

577
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:30,879
book that's a totally different book

578
00:16:28,679 --> 00:16:32,638
organics we're gonna make sure that we

579
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:34,399
get the right author on this

580
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,480
but that's another book that you need

581
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:39,919
either way

582
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:41,120
true living organics i can buy it on

583
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:41,679
amazon but it doesn't tell me who it's

584
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,879
by yet

585
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:44,958
got to keep clicking guys we're going to

586
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:46,639
get there just bear with me truly it's

587
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:48,319
by the rev i'm [ __ ] right all right

588
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,720
so the true living organics book by the

589
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,480
rev

590
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,160
is a great book there's a teaming with

591
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,240
microbes teaming with nutrients and

592
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:55,679
teaming with another thing series

593
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,759
that i really think are great books as

594
00:16:55,679 --> 00:17:00,879
well so check this those out

595
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:02,639
uh another um author that i would be

596
00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:05,119
failing you and myself if i did not

597
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,880
mention was mel frank check out books by

598
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,838

601
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,759
somebody else i should mention

602
00:17:11,838 --> 00:17:15,198
uh there's a book called three a light

603
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:15,838
three light will teach you a lot of

604
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,439
stuff

605
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:19,519
it's controversial they do a lot of

606
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,000
crazy [ __ ] but if you grow three pounds

607
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:21,679
of light

608
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,480
i think you're winning so check out that

609
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:24,959
book and then i think let's grow a pound

610
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,120

611
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,400

613

grow a pound of weed

614
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,798
let's grow a pound so those are several

615
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,880

know that this is an option i recommend

644
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:30,879
podcasts uh you can't read a book while

645
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,960
you're driving maybe you can

646
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,640
but i've seen terrible [ __ ] happen from

647
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,279
that so don't read a book while you're

648
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,480
driving

649
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:38,399
you can't read a book while you're in

650
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,160
the cubicle at work you can't undercover

651
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,640
read a book with an earbud in your ear

652
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,279
you can listen to podcasts all the time

653
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,640

654
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:46,319

656
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:48,558
sticking

657
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,720
and you didn't have to read it so i

658
00:18:48,558 --> 00:18:51,279
recommend podcast there are a lot of

659
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,160

minor cussing i am uh i'm myself on the

812
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,919
show before i thought about making a

813
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,279
cuss jar or a swear jar i did make a

814
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:30,559
contribution to somebody

815
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:32,240
every time for a certain amount of

816
00:23:30,558 --> 00:23:33,599
episodes if every time i set a cuss word

817
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,079
i had to put a five dollar bill in the

818
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:36,079
jar

819
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:37,839
that did happen uh we gave that away and

820
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:40,000
then i went back to saying [ __ ] it being

821
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:41,278
myself because sometimes

822
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,720
uh [ __ ] is the best word for the

823
00:23:41,278 --> 00:23:44,159
situation i'm sorry that some people

824
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,600
don't like that but

825
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:47,679

maybe you could use it for the podcast

843
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,200
we got this far i better use it on the

844
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,359
show it says

845
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,400
what keeps you motivated every day in

846
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:18,319
the industry

847
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,000
how do you keep the positive vibe going

848
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:23,278
what seems like every day

849
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,798
from your friend jer bear and his wife

850
00:24:23,278 --> 00:24:27,038

851
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:28,879
jerry bear and miss jerem

852
00:24:27,038 --> 00:24:30,640
uh it's a beautiful question because i

853
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,000
do work every day in the cannabis

854
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,679
industry whether it's in a warehouse

855
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,759
which hasn't been as much lately

856
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:37,200
which is kind of nice uh the covid stuff

857
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:38,960
slowed down all of that i haven't had to

858
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,360
go out of town to go to a commercial

859
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,200
grow

860
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:42,639
and suit up in all the weird grow gear

861
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,919
and that's been kind of nice taking a

862
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,759
little break doing that

863
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:46,960
but i am in the cannabis industry every

864
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:49,679

871
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:03,200
day and you're right

872
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:04,720
any industry that you're in i was in the

873
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,679
music industry and when i quit the music

874
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,200

877
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:11,519
going to be stressful it's going to have

878
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,599
some sort of a challenge

879
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:15,200
it's all about how you see that

880
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:16,798
challenge how you accept that challenge

881
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,000
how you embrace that challenge how you

882
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:21,200
take that struggle

883
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,759
uh how do i stay motivated every day

884
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:25,759

888
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,759

working in i.t that would not work for

890

me i could be in the military that would

891

and i'm blessed and grateful and i

895
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:44,399

896
00:25:43,038 --> 00:25:45,919
those things that i'm doing what i want

897

00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:54,158
lives

903

i want to do consultations and make big

904
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:56,080
grows they were making a little bit of

905
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:57,599
profit

906
00:25:56,079 --> 00:25:59,599
make a lot of profit so they can give

907
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:00,959
everybody in the center a bonus and the

908
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:01,519
patients can get a better quality

909
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,200
product

910
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:04,960
i'm doing what i want to do every day

911
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,640
all day long so i'm spoiled

912
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:09,200
and part of that keeps me motivated

913
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,559
knowing that if i don't do this

914
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,240
i could be doing that and i don't want

915
00:26:10,558 --> 00:26:13,759
to do that no and again no offense to

916
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,960
you guys doing your thing out there i

917
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:15,679
understand some people are [ __ ]

918
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,200
struggling

919
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:19,120
like i said i am blessed and i

920
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,759
acknowledge that i know that i've got a

921
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:21,678
very

922
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:23,119
good thing going so that part keeps me

923
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:26,000
motivated

924
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:27,119
then i got this knowledge i got this

925
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,519
knowledge by studying

926
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:30,239
reading learning absorbing practicing

927
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:33,119
repeat

928
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,480
uh but uh my name is rasta jeff so you

929
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:37,038
know what i believe in i believe in

930
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,759
ja i think that if i didn't use this and

931
00:26:37,038 --> 00:26:39,839
all also

932
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:41,759
not only the gift of learning cannabis

933
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:43,439
very well i've got this gift of speaking

934
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:45,278
and providing information relaying

935
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,320
information in a really clear and

936
00:26:45,278 --> 00:26:48,558
concise way

937
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:50,480
and if i didn't utilize both of those it

938
00:26:48,558 --> 00:26:53,359
would be disrespectful to you

939
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:55,200
and to ja to not put this gift back out

940
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:57,038
i'm blessed i'm given a lot of things

941
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,400
this is my return contribution there are

942
00:26:57,038 --> 00:26:58,879
a lot of things i do but this is one of

943
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,320
my

944
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:04,400
my give backs this is like my my karma

945
00:27:02,319 --> 00:27:05,918
and without this i would blow up if i

946
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,559
didn't do this show if i didn't grow

947
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:08,320
cannabis

948
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:09,678
if i didn't play the drums once or twice

949
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:11,038
a week i would

950
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:13,120
i don't know if it's spontaneously

951
00:27:11,038 --> 00:27:15,440
combust i don't know if it'd be uh

952
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:17,519
an explosion an eruption things wouldn't

953
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:19,440
be well so this podcast is what

954
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:20,720
it's a lot of my life this industry is a

955
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:23,679
lot of my life

956
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,720
uh seeing people seeing plants that look

957
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:26,559
yellow and shitty

958
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,240
turn into a successful harvest is part

959
00:27:26,558 --> 00:27:29,359
of what keeps me motivated turning [ __ ]

960
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,120
around

961
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:33,038
i wrote notes and i haven't even needed

962
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:34,000
to use them new questions keep me

963
00:27:33,038 --> 00:27:36,000
motivated every

964
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,359
day there's a new question every day

965
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
there's a new challenge

966
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:41,599
uh also every day there's new technology

967
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,038
i was telling somebody the other day

968
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:44,480
i haven't been in a commercial grow in

969
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:45,359
so long it hasn't been that long it's

970
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,960
been basically

971
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:48,719
a little bit into quarantine but i was

972
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,319
like i haven't been in a commercial grow

973
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,319
that i feel like it's all changed

974
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:54,000
because it changes so rapidly

975
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:55,278
like every other day we're like oh have

976
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,798
you seen this we should put one of these

977
00:27:55,278 --> 00:27:57,599
in the grove put this in room b and see

978
00:27:56,798 --> 00:27:59,119
what happens or

979
00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:00,319
let's put this in the small room and see

980
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:02,079
if it makes a difference we're always

981
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:03,678
looking at new toys new gear

982
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:05,359
and then we buy it and we put it in

983
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:06,960
there and we take notes we document that

984
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:08,158
[ __ ] watch it on camera watch it on the

985
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,759
monitor units

986
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:11,600
i haven't been able to do that i feel

987
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:13,200
like all the technology has surpassed me

988
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:14,398
in the past three four months i don't

989
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,640
know what's out there anymore

990
00:28:14,398 --> 00:28:18,079
but i'm paying attention by contacting

991
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,840
and communicating with my friends i

992
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:21,199

996
00:28:24,398 --> 00:28:27,759
so there are always new questions

997
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,839
there's always new technology

998
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:31,919
and there are always new states

999
00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:33,759
legalizing so i'm getting a whole new

1000

1006
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:45,679
constant influx of new people that need

1007
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:48,240

1008
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:50,240
from new people keeps me going i get to

1009
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,200
help 30 people a day fix their garden

1010
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,359
people that we're going to have a

1011
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,319
failure get to have a harvest and i

1012
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:56,240
don't know just seeing

1013
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:58,000
that improvement seeing a rescue just

1014
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:00,319
feels good that's motivating

1015
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,839
um there are new struggles every day

1016
00:29:00,319 --> 00:29:03,519
there are always new struggles in this

1017
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:04,639
industry i don't feel like i've learned

1018
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:06,879
everything yet

1019
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:09,200
and i kind of like uh it's like when you

1020
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,720
go into i use karate as an analogy a lot

1021
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,319
if you go into an mma fight

1022
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:14,480
both of you are trained you know how to

1023
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:15,678
do this you know what to expect

1024
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,720
but there's going to be a couple of

1025
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:18,320
moments in here we don't know what the

1026
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,759
[ __ ] is going on and we get to figure it

1027
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:21,599
out on the fly

1028
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:23,200
now that i'm comfortable [ __ ]

1029
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:24,719
swinging kicking blocking

1030
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,399
taking you down putting that choke hold

1031
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:28,240
on defending another chokehold wrapping

1032
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:30,158
around getting that kimura going

1033
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,759
now when you start to throw on that rear

1034
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:32,240
naked choke i know what to do i could

1035
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:33,839
shake out

1036
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,519
shake out of that rear naked choke i

1037
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:36,558
could [ __ ] get back up on top i could

1038
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:38,158
get the [ __ ] mount

1039
00:29:36,558 --> 00:29:39,918
i could ground and pound at that point

1040
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:40,320
so if you throw some weird questions at

1041
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:41,840
me

1042
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:43,599
it's not hard anymore i know what i'm

1043
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:45,038
doing but i like the challenge of

1044
00:29:43,599 --> 00:29:46,480
answering the question kind of on the

1045
00:29:45,038 --> 00:29:47,759
fly that's why i do that monday live

1046
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,919
show that keeps me sharp

1047
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:51,359
there's no editing no censoring i try to

1048
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:52,000
answer every question that comes in it

1049
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:53,278
comes in

1050
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,119
they're like what's 9 times nine i'm

1051
00:29:53,278 --> 00:29:55,679
like 81 like what's a plus b and i'm

1052
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:57,519

plus a [ __ ] i gotta answer them as

1054
00:29:57,519 --> 00:30:00,879
quick as i can so

1055
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:02,319
those challenges keep me motivated i

1056
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,919
like it uh

1057
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:04,960
i can't remember who said it now but i

1058
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:05,919
got so many quotes in my head i'm

1059
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,919
forgetting the author

1060
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:09,120
uh was it einstein or edison that said i

1061
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:10,880
don't think i'm a genius i'm just

1062
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:12,639
passionately curious it was [ __ ]

1063
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,039
einstein bruno's einstein yes who said

1064
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,278
that

1065
00:30:13,038 --> 00:30:16,158
uh passionately curious that's me i want

1066
00:30:15,278 --> 00:30:18,079
to know

1067
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:20,159
everything about this plant inside and

1068
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:21,038
out so that i can make you guys able to

1069
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:22,960
grow this plant

1070
00:30:21,038 --> 00:30:25,519
beautifully and perfectly if i don't

1071
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:27,600
understand completely i can't teach you

1072
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:28,879
so the rewards are a lot of what keeps

1073
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:30,079
me motivated of course there's a

1074
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,840
financial reward

1075
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:33,839
i get patreon contributions for the show

1076
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:34,319
sponsors pay me i get a paycheck for

1077
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:36,158
doing

1078
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:37,678
uh consulting i get paid for selling

1079
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:40,799
seeds but

1080
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:42,559
on top of that the inbox messages that

1081
00:30:40,798 --> 00:30:43,200
say hey ross to jeff my plants were

1082
00:30:42,558 --> 00:30:45,519
failing

1083
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,038
and you spent five minutes on a podcast

1084
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:50,000
saying do this do this and do that

1085
00:30:47,038 --> 00:30:51,839
and now my plants look amazing that is

1086
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,159
equally as rewarding as a

1087
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:55,599
paypal financial contribution don't stop

1088
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:56,559
with the paypal and don't stop with the

1089
00:30:55,599 --> 00:30:59,119
compliments either

1090
00:30:56,558 --> 00:31:00,798
but they feel equally as well they're

1091
00:30:59,119 --> 00:31:01,439
both like a big high five a pat on the

1092
00:31:00,798 --> 00:31:04,398
back

1093
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:05,440
then people saying i've got cancer and i

1094
00:31:04,398 --> 00:31:07,278
felt like [ __ ]

1095
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,880
and you taught me how to grow weed and i

1096
00:31:07,278 --> 00:31:09,519
smoke weed and i forgot that i have

1097
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,039
cancer

1098
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:13,440
bro think about how that would make you

1099
00:31:11,038 --> 00:31:14,798
feel inside that is awesome so

1100
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,399
i get to get filled up with that

1101
00:31:14,798 --> 00:31:17,119
positive energy from those sort of

1102
00:31:16,398 --> 00:31:18,959
stories

1103
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:20,639
all the time and then i get to see it in

1104
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,000
real life not just through messages i

1105
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:24,000
get to see that [ __ ] so

1106
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,599
that's a lot of what keeps me motivated

1107
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,200
uh that is a big part of what keeps me

1108
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:29,119
motivated seeing the outcome

1109
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,720
tangible outcomes keep me motivated when

1110
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:32,639
you're accomplishing goals

1111
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,240
uh you want to get more goals when you

1112
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,120
when you can do two things in a day you

1113
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,240
want to do three

1114
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:37,599
and then when you get three you want to

1115
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,519
do five and there's something about

1116
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:41,199
doing five that makes you want to do 10

1117
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:42,798
and when you do 10 you don't want 11.

1118
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,558
you want 20. and when you got 20 you

1119
00:31:42,798 --> 00:31:46,960
want 25 or 30 and when you get 30 you

1120
00:31:44,558 --> 00:31:48,798
want 50 and 50 makes you 100

1121
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,079
and that's that's just not money i'm not

1122
00:31:48,798 --> 00:31:51,038
just saying financially i'm saying

1123
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:53,038
crushing goals

1124
00:31:51,038 --> 00:31:54,319
i'm saying collecting anything when you

1125
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:55,278
get that snowball going it's

1126
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:57,038
exponentially

1127
00:31:55,278 --> 00:31:58,480
and i like accomplishing goals i know

1128
00:31:57,038 --> 00:31:59,679
how much i can get done in a day and

1129
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:02,000
it's [ __ ] tremendous

1130
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:03,200
so answering those many questions seeing

1131
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,159
the tangible progress

1132
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:07,278

slash grow from your heart

1165
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:00,240
let's keep going it says so can over

1166
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:02,000
fertilization cause a plant to herm yes

1167
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,759
it can that is the quick answer

1168
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,839
and if so do you stress test your

1169
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:08,480
strains to their perming point

1170
00:33:05,839 --> 00:33:11,119
um that's another great question um can

1171
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:13,839
plants herm from over fertilization yes

1172
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:15,359
uh things like og kush and some chems

1173
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:18,158
will absolutely herm

1174
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:18,959
by looking at them wrong you can breathe

1175
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:20,880
at it wrong

1176
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,240
you can wear the wrong shirt if your

1177
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,760
shoes and your shirt don't match

1178
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,640
sometimes og kush will get mad at you

1179
00:33:23,759 --> 00:33:28,158
and her mouth

1180
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:30,240
that is a thing that cush genetics do

1181
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:32,799
over feed under feed the wrong

1182
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:35,120
temperatures major temperature swings

1183
00:33:32,798 --> 00:33:37,599
weird stresses those things can cause

1184
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:39,678
hermaphroditic traits in plants yes

1185
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:40,719
over fertilization can absolutely cause

1186
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:42,480
a plant to herm

1187
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,960
it's going i've been fed so hard that i

1188
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,079
just don't know what to do so i'm just

1189
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,000
going to kind of freak out and when a

1190
00:33:46,079 --> 00:33:49,759
plant freaks out in hermaphrodite it's

1191
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,119
trying to become asexual

1192
00:33:49,759 --> 00:33:53,119
pollinate itself so that it can

1193
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:54,959
reproduce and even if it's going to die

1194
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:56,639
a slow miserable death at least it gets

1195
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:59,600
to make babies and they get to live

1196
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:01,759
and try again so yes over fertilization

1197
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:03,839
can absolutely cause your plant to hurt

1198
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:05,038
the second part is if so do you test

1199
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:09,039
your strains to their

1200
00:34:05,038 --> 00:34:11,519
herming point i've done something better

1201
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:13,279
i know that a lot of stress tests will

1202
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:15,199
cause my plants to her my favorite

1203
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:17,119
stress test is a light stress

1204
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:18,719
i put the lights on for 12 12 we're now

1205
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:20,399
in flower for 12 12.

1206
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:22,239
eventually i'll [ __ ] that light cycle up

1207
00:34:20,398 --> 00:34:23,199
and put it on 18-6 then put it back to

1208
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:24,638
12-12

1209
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:26,398
i'll watch and see if the plants do any

1210
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:27,919
weird [ __ ] if they don't they get to

1211
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:29,279
keep living if they do weird [ __ ] guess

1212
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:30,878
what we cut them all down they go

1213
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,560
bye-bye they're not breeding plants

1214
00:34:30,878 --> 00:34:34,159
then i'll put them on 24 hours then i'll

1215
00:34:32,559 --> 00:34:35,039
put them back on 12 12 and we'll keep

1216
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:36,720
watching them

1217
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:37,838
if they don't harm out from that i don't

1218
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:39,199
think they're going to harm out from

1219
00:34:37,838 --> 00:34:41,599
over fertilization

1220
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:42,719
so that is how my plants are auditioned

1221
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:45,039
for breeding

1222
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:47,358
once those plants are pollinated i send

1223
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:49,599
my seeds to a lot of people

1224
00:34:47,358 --> 00:34:51,598
and i know that many of those people are

1225
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:52,720
over feeders i'm not calling anybody out

1226
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:55,119
i've selected people

1227
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:56,959
that are amazing growers and scary

1228
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:58,400
growers and everywhere in between

1229
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,240
i know that my plants are getting grown

1230
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,440
by [ __ ] champions and i also know

1231
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:02,479
that the seeds i made are getting

1232
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,800
[ __ ] abused

1233
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:06,719
like [ __ ] hostages in a [ __ ] cage

1234
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:09,119
somewhere but that's what i need to see

1235
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:10,799
i rely on those abusive growers to tell

1236
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:12,720
me that these plants are herms or not

1237
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,160
they're the ones gonna find the problems

1238
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:15,598
and when they don't find herms they

1239
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:17,279
don't find problems i know that the

1240
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:19,680
plants are good for people so

1241
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,560
i don't over fertilize for stress

1242
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:22,399
testing

1243
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:23,838
i do more of a light test i do more

1244
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,639
weird [ __ ] like that

1245
00:35:23,838 --> 00:35:28,078
but the growers my testers i am certain

1246
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:30,000
that they are over fertilizing i have

1247
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:32,560
seen some crazy [ __ ] and test reports

1248
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,679
so they're the ones doing that for me it

1249
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:36,480
goes on to say

1250
00:35:33,679 --> 00:35:37,118
also since i have learned a clone seeds

1251
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,079
seem

1252
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:41,920
amazingly cheap that is my favorite

1253
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:42,320
favorite statement on today's podcast

1254
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,680
yeah

1255
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,200
seeds are expensive you pay a good

1256
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:46,319
dollar amount for a package of seeds

1257
00:35:45,199 --> 00:35:47,838
some people have been paying

1258
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,359
good dollar amounts for some seeds on

1259
00:35:47,838 --> 00:35:51,519
cannabis and some auctions

1260
00:35:49,358 --> 00:35:53,679
and those are rare gems but if you think

1261
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:55,199
about having a rare gym at a high cost

1262
00:35:53,679 --> 00:35:57,039
nobody else has got that package of

1263
00:35:55,199 --> 00:36:00,480
seeds once you take clones of it

1264
00:35:57,039 --> 00:36:01,679
you've got that plan forever

1265
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,280
you don't have to lose it you keep the

1266
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:04,559
clone going you keep a clone you keep a

1267
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,920
clone you're always going to have that

1268
00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:08,239
genetic that cultivar

1269
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:09,280
you can reproduce that outcome over and

1270
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:11,039
over again

1271
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:13,200
your patients or your clientele or your

1272
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:14,960
bong will always have that supply

1273
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:16,960
of that same medicine and if it's

1274
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,639
something amazing if it came from seed

1275
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,159
and nobody else has it because it came

1276
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:20,559
from a seed and you don't give a clone

1277
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:22,078
out

1278
00:36:20,559 --> 00:36:23,599
nobody else has it now you've set

1279
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:25,359
yourself apart from the market

1280
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:26,720
if you're one of those guys that needs

1281
00:36:25,358 --> 00:36:28,719
market competition

1282
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:31,118
nobody else has it you can say i've got

1283
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:31,519
the only strawberry starburst around

1284
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:33,599
here

1285
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:34,960
it came from a seed i got the phenotype

1286
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:36,559
that turns purple and smells like

1287
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,920
watermelons nobody else has it

1288
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:39,599
you're the only one with it what they

1289
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,440
want it guess who's coming to you

1290
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:43,760
everybody that wants that one all right

1291
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:45,039
so uh yes seeds are amazingly cheap once

1292
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,160
you learn how to clone you can keep that

1293
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:48,239
see it around forever

1294
00:36:46,159 --> 00:36:49,838
a couple of runs it will pay for those

1295
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:51,039
seeds hopefully the first run pays for

1296
00:36:49,838 --> 00:36:52,639
the seeds on itself

1297
00:36:51,039 --> 00:36:54,719
covers the cost of gear and nutrients

1298
00:36:52,639 --> 00:36:56,719
that second one is all for the pocket

1299
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:58,719
all right it says thanks for all you do

1300
00:36:56,719 --> 00:37:00,000
and that's how the news goes i want to

1301
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:02,078
thank you for the great message i've

1302
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:05,199
seen you pop up in the feed a few times

1303
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:06,480
um yeah so basically food will cause it

1304
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:08,799
to uh hermaphrodite

1305
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,400
temps and stress and light problems and

1306
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,599
i think i covered all of that

1307
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,119
yep all right you didn't leave your name

1308
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:13,838
