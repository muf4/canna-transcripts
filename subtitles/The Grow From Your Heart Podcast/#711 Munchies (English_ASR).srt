last couple of episodes were quite

44
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,719
intensive episodes uh 709 was all about

45
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:50,959
the evolution of dabs and dabbing and

46
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:53,599
concentrates then of course we had pedro

47
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:55,438
and roz and ryan on for episode 710 we

48
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:56,879
learned a lot this episode we're going

49
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:58,239
to relax we're going to cool down a

50
00:01:56,879 --> 00:01:59,839
little bit we're going to have a good

51
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:02,319
time we're going to talk about something

52
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,000
we all enjoy something we all indulge in

53
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:06,078
something that may be a little bit of a

54
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,519
personal weakness maybe a point where we

55
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:09,840
spoil ourselves and treat ourselves

56
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:11,759
today we're going to talk about munchies

57
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,439
what's better than having some munchies

58
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:14,959
after you smoke honestly this may be a

59
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:16,318
weird side note and this may derail the

60
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,719
whole show here but

61
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:20,399
i like to get super baked and not eat i

62
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:22,479
like to fight those munchies sometimes i

63
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,400
feel like those munchies you get super

64
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:25,679
baked you take a few fat dabs and then

65
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,520
you start eating cookies and the next

66
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,959
thing you know not even stone anymore

67
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,319
you got to eat more cookies or you eat a

68
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,920
bunch you take a bunch of dabs and you

69
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:33,679
go to out to dinner and halfway through

70
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:35,598
dinner you're like oh i just ruined my

71
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,680
whole buzz don't get me wrong i love to

72
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:40,318
go to dinner go to thai food order two

73
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,319
entrees super blazed and eat them both i

74
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:43,919

75
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:45,919
to fight off those munchies i don't

76
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:48,318

77
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:51,039
that hunger enjoy the buzz however when

78
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:52,799
i do let those munchies take over

79
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:54,878

80
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,800
munchies kick in i will eat everything

81

104
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,560
things we put in our bodies we shouldn't

myself i'm human don't get me wrong i

109

00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,680
every week you guys don't care about my

113
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,759
diet i try to take care of myself when i

114
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,920
get blazed i will allow myself to slip

115
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:06,239
on the diet have some crap occasionally

116
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:08,798
especially in the car if i'm on a road

117
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,400
trip um and i have to say if i'm the

118
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,159
passenger on a road trip just you know

119
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,319
for legal and safety reasons and i do

120
00:04:12,158 --> 00:04:15,919
get blazed and we stop at the gas

121
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:18,560
station or somewhere small like that to

122
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:21,279
get some munchies i definitely will

123
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,879
use that as a good excuse to indulge in

124
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:24,319
some crap food we'll talk about what i

125
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:25,120
get from the gas stations in a moment

126
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:27,040
here

127
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,959
i do prefer honestly to stick with

128
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,000
healthier snack options if that's

129
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:32,478
possible

130
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,399
available affordable effective if i

131
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:35,918
prepared properly and also if that's

132
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:37,679
what my high mouth wants sometimes my

133
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:39,599
stoned mouth wants something sugary and

134
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,478
terrible for me sometimes i'll treat

135
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,560
myself also i smoke a lot and i do

136
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:46,959
podcasts i constantly [ __ ] talk i

137
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,639
never stop talking i get it i do know

138
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:50,879
that about myself i apologize if you're

139
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:53,120
sick of hearing me but that also brings

140
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:55,040
in a lot of dryness a lot of dry throat

141
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,160
a lot of dry mouth so i need snacks i

142
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:00,400
prefer snacks that are juicy and not uh

143
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,919
dehydrating and drying something

144
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:04,319
people hate the word moist but guess

145
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:05,758
what i need a nice moist snack something

146
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:07,199
with some moisture

147
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,038
not something that's going to induce

148
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,360
more cottonmouth more dryness more

149
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:13,918
phlegm i try to stay away from crackers

150
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,680
like i definitely don't want a cracker

151
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:17,198
i definitely don't need dairy products

152
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,400
it's going to make me sound all

153
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,000
in the throat i don't need sorry for

154
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:22,319
doing that that was [ __ ] rude i don't

155
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,399
eat all that kind of snack so i try to

156
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:26,159
stick with like healthy stuff what is

157
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:27,679
healthy stuff fruit a lot of people

158
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,360
think that fruit is uh it's kind of a

159
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,800
hippie snack it's great it's what i was

160
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,639
put here for it's got enough sugar to

161
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,560
keep you going it's give you some energy

162
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,720
it's got all the right components to

163
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,319
make that sugar not unhealthy it's got

164
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,320
fiber and vitamins in there depending on

165
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:42,079
the fruit or vegetables you choose but

166
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:43,839
fruits and vegetables are great for when

167
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:45,680
you're blazed uh what's better than

168
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:47,758
biting into like a juicy orange think

169
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,959
about how good that is we have forgotten

170
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,479
we go to the store and we get all that

171
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:52,239

176
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,479

177
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:02,879
tongue feel how good that [ __ ] is we

178
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:04,719

you don't prepare sometimes you're not

184
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,160
where that stuff is sometimes you hit

185
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:16,719
the gas station and you just eat crap

186
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:19,039

of my friends what they like to eat and

193

i'm leading with all this we're going to

195

200
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,360
healthy snacks once you get blazed i

201
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:46,959

snacks that you let yourself eat then

203
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:51,279
also i asked about regional snacks

204
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,199

00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,439
i'm not thinking about but chili's are

209
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:01,119
kind of our regional snack depending on

things come down to it i grew up in

233
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,879
southern california and there's nothing

234
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,959

itch if you will then he says i hate

422
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,959
spending money on drinks i drink water

423

but i do spend a lot of money on

429
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,440
delicious drinks perhaps that's why i

430
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,600
stay

431
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,440
i'm a skinny dude i'm 6'5 and

432
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,199
under 200 pounds because i don't eat a

433
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,120
lot of junk i think most of my snacks

434
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:13,599
are drinks which means i get to just pee

435
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,839
out most of it then he goes on to say

436
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,278
crunchy but not much of a cake guy

437
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:19,600
sometimes bro

438
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:21,039
birthday cake cupcakes the cupcakes with

439
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,839
[ __ ] sprinkles on them at a gas

440
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:26,399
station that is one of my weaknesses oh

441
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:28,639
yeah uh healthy snacks usually peanuts

442
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:31,198
or almonds dude i love

443
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:32,879
pistachios especially the pistachios

444
00:14:31,198 --> 00:14:34,559
that have been uh cracked already and

445
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:37,039

448
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,399
uh it says

449
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:44,319
also some kind of fruit or almonds or

450
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,919
peanuts i eat crap food when i get

451
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,519
stoned when not stoned something i'm

452
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:49,360
trying to get better at oh let's see i

453
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:51,278
eat crap stoned oh he eats crap when he

454
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,039
is stoned and not stoned i get it bro we

455
00:14:51,278 --> 00:14:55,360
live in america where they feed us and

456
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:56,958
offer us all of this [ __ ] that we should

457
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,320
not be eating and something you will

458
00:14:56,958 --> 00:15:00,719
notice this is a weird political rant

459
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:03,040
i'm not going to go too far on uh the

460
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,278
cheaper the food the worse it is for you

461
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:06,879
like the worst [ __ ] is more affordable

462
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:08,399
until you learn how to shop and eat like

463
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:09,759
vegetarian shopping is cheap once you've

464
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,078
figured out fruits and vegetables and

465
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:13,600
things to sustain rice is cheap but yeah

466
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:15,599
they make they really make it seem

467
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,759
expensive to take care of yourself

468
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,839
let's stay on track japanese and south

469
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:22,159
korean candy is the best candy in the

470
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:23,680
world yes one of my notes later is

471
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:24,879
exotic terps

472
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:27,120
cheetos used to come out with the

473
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:28,720
cinnamon sugar puffs during christmas to

474
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,720
eat a whole bag of those in one sitting

475
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,160
i haven't ever seen those bro but ah

476
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,639

477
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:36,240
me think of the taco bell uh the [ __ ]

478
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,879
cinnamon twisted taco bell probably

479
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,959
similar but better then he said subs

480

00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:17,599
passed away a couple of years ago love

561
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:20,798
you karen rest in peace karen would made

562
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:22,639
uh would make fudge and carrot cake that

563
00:18:20,798 --> 00:18:24,240
you could not get enough of they would

564
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,840
have to put electrodes around it because

565
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,599
i would constantly be reaching into the

566
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:29,519
fudge and taking little bites of it and

567
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:31,119
i would forget that it was medicated and

568
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:32,639
by halfway through the day my eyes would

569
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:34,000
be so heavy that i couldn't function i

570
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,160
would have the munchies and a lot like

571
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,079
our friend here i would keep reaching in

572
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:40,240
and going back for more of that

573
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:41,359
medicated fudge i would just be goofy by

574
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,359
the end of the day things would be hard

575
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:44,798
to handle uh but i worked at a

576
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:46,558
dispensary where the owner made

577
00:18:44,798 --> 00:18:48,639
medicated fudge and encouraged me to eat

578
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:50,639
it so it's her fault love you karen

579
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,000
sorry for uh being so high at work all

580
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,840
the time it was your fault dude all

581
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,960
right let's keep going i thought that's

582
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:56,240
funny though when you get high and keep

583
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,519
eating the edibles and you keep getting

584
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,359
higher and you keep eating the edibles

585
00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:01,679
and you're like what's going on here man

586
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:04,399
you fall into that loop i love it the

587
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:05,919

594
00:19:16,558 --> 00:19:20,639
to if you care

595
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,319
it goes on it says uh from snazzy my

596
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:25,120
wife's cookies dunked in a hot cup of

597
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:27,519
coffee is going to give me diabetes but

598
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:29,199
i will do it with a smile on my face bro

599
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:31,119
isn't that how it is sometimes snacks

600
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,038
are so good you're like yeah taking

601
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:34,639
[ __ ] six weeks off my life with every

602
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:36,160
cookie but guess what i don't want to

603
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,840
get old anyway

604
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,440
then it goes on it says uh sweet and

605
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:40,959
spicy pickles are probably the only

606
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,880
thing resembling healthy food that i

607
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,960
reach for when i'm high that's such a

608
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:47,200
good debate is a pickle a spicy snack

609
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:49,759
who cares it's so good and we're back to

610
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:52,400
the trend cold and refreshing i noticed

611
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:53,919
the potheads like a cold and refreshing

612
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,519
snack all of that cold and refreshing

613
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,759
snack talk makes me need to hit a drink

614
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:58,798
of this cold and refreshing kombucha

615
00:19:57,759 --> 00:20:00,079
here we'll talk about that in a minute

616
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:01,519
i'm gonna take a drink not edit this you

617
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:04,839
guys hang out drink something while i'm

618
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:04,839
doing it

619
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:13,759
i really love the feeling of

620
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,359
carbonation going down the throat when

621
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:16,879
i'm good and blazed

622
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:18,399
i feel like what's that soap with the

623
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,919
scrubbing bubbles i feel like it just

624
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,600
gets in there knocks out the uh what do

625
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:23,200
you call it earlier the pasties just

626
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:24,639
gets in there and scrubs out the pasties

627
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,480
the cottonmouth

628
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:29,679
nothing like some good kombucha bubbles

629
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:32,960
uh i was i used to be an avid dr pepper

630
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:35,120
addict uh i would drink a ridiculous and

631
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,679
embarrassingly gross amount of dr pepper

632
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:40,319
every day i was doing a uh

633
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:41,759
kind of a battle how high can i get now

634
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:42,879
i need to battle it out or even it out

635
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:44,879
with caffeine and now i'm too

636
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,480
caffeinated let's dab more now let's

637
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,400
drink more caffeine and by the end of

638
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,000
the day i'd be [ __ ] anxious and shaky

639
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,360
and i called it blown out my mind

640
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,279
couldn't [ __ ] focus i couldn't make

641
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:55,359
eye contact with anybody because i was

642
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:57,839
so high and so caffeinated that i wasn't

643
00:20:55,359 --> 00:21:00,959
either one and my body was just fried

644
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:04,079
i haven't had caffeine and dr pepper uh

645
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:06,400
and probably two and a half nearly three

646
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:08,000
years i think if i've got my time right

647
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,400
something i've noticed is in that time

648

people have asked me a lot about

1034
00:33:54,798 --> 00:33:59,918
kombucha and advice about kombucha

1035
00:33:57,119 --> 00:34:01,678
kombucha is a very acquired taste there

1036
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:03,679
are lots of different varieties flavors

1037
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:05,840
types of kombucha this one i'm showing

1038
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:07,679
to the camera here is kavita brand

1039
00:34:05,839 --> 00:34:11,239
nobody pays me i buy kombucha at the

1040
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:13,838
store uh just like everybody else kavita

1041
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:16,078
k-e-v-i-t-a master brew kombucha this is

1042
00:34:13,838 --> 00:34:18,000
a ginger flavored one of my favorites i

1043
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:18,960
really enjoy the tart cherry from this

1044
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,358
brand

1045
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:24,240
this is what i kind of call gas station

1046
00:34:21,358 --> 00:34:26,398
kombucha this isn't real um

1047
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:29,598
real high in probiotics real fermented

1048
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:32,799
flavored this is kind of a kombucha soda

1049
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:34,240
entry level amateur kombucha um if i'm

1050
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,599
at the gas station if options are

1051
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:37,918
limited if the stores are low on

1052
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:40,399
inventory these are refreshing they

1053
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:41,759
taste good it's not a soda it's a good

1054
00:34:40,398 --> 00:34:43,838
snack it's a good drink for the day i

1055
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,280
like the bubbles a lot when i'm blazed

1056
00:34:43,838 --> 00:34:46,719
but if you want to be healthy and if

1057
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:49,119
you're drinking kombucha for health

1058
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:51,678
reasons i definitely prefer

1059
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:53,358
gt's brand kombucha they make a lot of

1060
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:55,358
different great kombuchas

1061
00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:57,679
there's the raw and unfiltered

1062
00:34:55,358 --> 00:34:59,279
this one's organic and unpasteurized a

1063
00:34:57,679 --> 00:35:01,199
lot of them say synergy here you'll see

1064
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,599
a lot of different words this blue

1065
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:05,519
flavor is one of my favorites they said

1066
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:07,440
it was going to be seasonal

1067
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:09,599
we kind of demanded that it was not

1068
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:11,358
seasonal i think they heard us this one

1069
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:12,880
is called sacred life this one has

1070
00:35:11,358 --> 00:35:15,838
without reading i do remember i think

1071
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:17,838
it's got kiwi juice coconut water and

1072
00:35:15,838 --> 00:35:19,440
ginger and then all the probiotics from

1073
00:35:17,838 --> 00:35:21,039
a kombucha in there

1074
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:23,679
this is more of a

1075
00:35:21,039 --> 00:35:25,759
potent fermented pungent sort of a

1076
00:35:23,679 --> 00:35:27,358
kombucha this one uh it takes a little

1077
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,200
getting used to if you're not into that

1078
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:30,880
if you can drink a good beer if you're

1079
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:32,799
into fermented things you will enjoy

1080
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:35,039
this it may take some getting used to

1081
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,800
some adjustment this is more of the

1082
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:38,400
entry level brand

1083
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,400
if you try one kombucha and you don't

1084
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:42,000
like it that doesn't mean you don't like

1085
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,240
kombuchas every brand does it

1086
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,880
differently different flavors dilution

1087
00:35:44,239 --> 00:35:48,879
styles some are real bold and like dark

1088
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:50,960
beer kind of flavored some taste like

1089
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,720
[ __ ] bum wine and fruit juice there

1090
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:55,039
are a lot of options don't let it turn

1091
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:56,078
you down turn you off also don't force

1092
00:35:55,039 --> 00:35:57,599
it if you don't like it you just don't

1093
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:59,280
like it but i really enjoy a good

1094
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:00,640
kombucha after all that talk i'm going

1095
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:04,560
to take a hit of this ginger kombucha

1096
00:36:00,639 --> 00:36:04,559
just because i can't resist anymore

1097
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:11,920
oh yeah those good bubbles

1098
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:13,118
good refreshing ginger bite it's got

1099
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:15,680
like a nice bite to it and that

1100
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:16,880
fermented flavor um i got some german

1101
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:18,399
blood in me there's got to be some

1102
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,480
norwegian some dutch in me something

1103
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,680
like that maybe some scottish i got a

1104
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,960
red beard

1105
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:26,159
i don't know exactly i haven't done the

1106
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:28,159
23andme yet but those people uh from

1107
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:29,838
those regions tend to enjoy fermented

1108
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:31,838
type foods so it only makes sense that i

1109
00:36:29,838 --> 00:36:33,920
would like a kombucha also i don't drink

1110
00:36:31,838 --> 00:36:35,358
because i have a problem um regulating

1111
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,519
my alcohol content i have a drink in

1112
00:36:35,358 --> 00:36:39,598
years but i love a good dark beer so

1113
00:36:37,519 --> 00:36:40,800
it's only likely that i would enjoy a

1114
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:43,119
kombucha

1115
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:45,359
let's move on um what do i like to eat

1116
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:47,838
for snacks bro lately i've been munching

1117
00:36:45,358 --> 00:36:49,119
uh pistachios they're healthy i don't

1118
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:51,358
feel like i'm eating [ __ ] they're not

1119
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:53,680
super sugary they're not bad for my

1120
00:36:51,358 --> 00:36:55,679
teeth they satiate hunger they give me

1121
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:57,279
energy i'm sure there's like some sort

1122
00:36:55,679 --> 00:36:59,279
of nutrient some sort of cellium or

1123
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,880
selenium or some something's got to be

1124
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:03,440
good for my hair teeth nails and eyes

1125
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:06,000
and all those pistachios the thai chili

1126
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:08,079
pistachios are divine i can eat the

1127
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,159
whole damn however big the bag is i can

1128
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:12,400
eat it all on a drive on a road trip

1129
00:37:10,159 --> 00:37:14,239
during a movie let's crunch down on some

1130
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,920

sort of snacks or something i mostly go

1143
00:37:37,199 --> 00:37:41,598
for something that makes me feel i said

1144
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:43,280
a moment ago full and satiated but not

1145
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:45,440
like a piece of [ __ ] like i'm just

1146
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:47,519
eating useless calories and feeding my

1147
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:50,159
body crap

1148
00:37:47,519 --> 00:37:52,079
now with that being said um sometimes if

1149
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:53,838
i'm on the road i've talked about this i

1150
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:56,240
like to get cupcakes and [ __ ] like that

1151
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:57,920
that's my excuse uh just driving from

1152
00:37:56,239 --> 00:37:59,919
boulder to pueblo or

1153
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:01,440
denver to pueblo or where i'm wherever i

1154
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:03,200
might be going that weekend coming back

1155
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,639
from a concert or something all the

1156
00:38:03,199 --> 00:38:07,039
restaurants are closed i didn't plan

1157
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:08,400
ahead uh chiba hut was closed i love

1158
00:38:07,039 --> 00:38:09,838
some good chiba hut when i'm blaze shout

1159
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,280
out to chiba hut

1160
00:38:09,838 --> 00:38:12,799
but if i didn't get some chiba hut if we

1161
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:15,040
missed the opportunity for chiba hut or

1162
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,480
fuzzies tacos or something ah that's

1163
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:18,800
when i'm gonna go to the gas station get

1164
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:20,240
some cupcakes or i like to try like

1165
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,519
different kind of energy bars and stuff

1166
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:23,118
but those are overpriced and they're

1167
00:38:21,519 --> 00:38:25,039
still that's just a candy bar you're

1168
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:27,760
just eating [ __ ] anyway so you'll often

1169
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:29,519
see me get like some cool ranch doritos

1170
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:31,280
maybe some kind of garlicky spicy

1171
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:33,358
crunchy potato chips or something like

1172
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:35,040
that and then i'll grab like a cupcake i

1173
00:38:33,358 --> 00:38:37,279
mentioned earlier i like those birthday

1174
00:38:35,039 --> 00:38:39,199
cake cupcakes i really like the orange

1175
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:41,200
cupcakes i may sound crazy but the

1176
00:38:39,199 --> 00:38:42,879
orange flavored cupcakes are great the

1177
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:44,239
cake is good it's always nice and moist

1178
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:46,240
to get that creamy center and then the

1179
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:48,239
frosting has got like a little just a

1180
00:38:46,239 --> 00:38:50,479
texture that i enjoy that's really nice

1181
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:52,078
for me i don't do candy stuff i've said

1182
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,838
that i'm not into like the sweet tarts

1183
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:56,079
and crunchy candy

1184
00:38:53,838 --> 00:38:58,239
gummy candy suckers that's not for me no

1185
00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:00,800
nerd ropes none of that [ __ ]

1186
00:38:58,239 --> 00:39:02,879

1187
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:04,400
brownie if the brownies are right a

1188
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:06,320
brownie corner with a little bit of

1189
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:08,480
crunch in that texture i'm down with the

1190
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:10,000
brownie but i really try to stay away

1191
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:11,920
from that stuff

1192
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,440

1196
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:21,679
sonic where you live sonic is a place

1197
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:23,119
where they serve drinks and food and

1198
00:39:21,679 --> 00:39:25,440
it's fast food

1199
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:27,680
people like to get a blue coconut slush

1200
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:30,159
or they have blue coconut drinks i am

1201
00:39:27,679 --> 00:39:32,480
allergic to the blue food coloring or

1202
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:34,879
something it will make me projectile

1203
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:36,240
vomit like a [ __ ] dragon can't do

1204
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:38,079
blue drinks

1205

1206
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:43,280

it's caffeine free

1210
00:39:46,559 --> 00:39:51,039
but that is as close to drinking like a

1211
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:54,400
sugary shitty soda that i've let myself

1212
