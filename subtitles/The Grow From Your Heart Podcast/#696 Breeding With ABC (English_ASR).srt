50
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,960
little bit like this it says my question

51
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:01,360
is so far i'm very impressed with the

52
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:04,000
golden goat bx i've received everything

53
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:06,239
is working out great but i need to look

54
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,479
at expanding my selection yes that is

55
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:10,000
very uh a grower thing once you get good

56
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,760
at growing a plant you have fun with it

57
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,919
you realize i want to grow something

58
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:16,318
different grow more get more experiences

59
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:17,679
more flavors that is how it goes uh then

60
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:21,199
you end up filling a room with a bunch

61
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:23,040
of great [ __ ] i growing is so much fun i

66
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,159
track

67
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,719
it says i'm a big fan of sour diesel i

68
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:37,120
mean it's probably my favorite strain to

69
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:40,239
date and i've been stoned for over 30

70
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,080
years on all different types of weed

71
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,800
a lot of us that have been smoking for a

72
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,640
long time love the sour diesel the chem

73
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,120
the kush those are three distinct

74
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:51,039
flavors and aromas and kind of classes

75
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,878
of cannabis that we all enjoy and i

76
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:55,519
totally agree with you that sour diesel

77
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:57,759
that diesel turp uh the buzz the flavor

78
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,439
the aroma everything about it is highly

79
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:01,280
desirable when you got a bag of the good

80
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:02,479
sour diesel in your pocket you get in

81
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,158
the car with a friend and they're like

82
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:06,238
oh dude you brought the diesel they know

83
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:07,519
right away the whole neighborhood knows

84
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,000
right away when you roll a joint and

85
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:12,239
smoke that [ __ ] good sour diesel is

86
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,919
amazing so i understand why it's one of

87
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,400
your favorites it stands out like i said

88
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:18,878
it's got its own category that gas that

89
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,840
diesel flavor that's its own thing it

90
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:23,598
says uh what strain would you say would

91
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,360
be close to that i've been growing

92
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:28,079
different strains for six years looking

93
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:31,360
for something like this and since after

94
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,440
uh after 650 plus podcasts i feel that

95
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,840
you your genetics and knowledge can help

96
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:38,318
with this thanks in advance keep it up

97
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,680
and growers love of course that was from

98
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:41,919
our friend

99
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,519
maritime grower there thank you for the

100
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:45,199
great message thank you for the

101
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:48,400
nostalgia when i read the message about

102
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:50,238
the sour diesel i could smell the diesel

103
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,879
the way that it used to make my

104
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,158
it would make my my smoke room i was i

105
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:56,959
think it was my bedroom back in the day

106
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:58,798
would make that room stink so good

107
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,560
i remembered how when i would get a

108
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,080
large quantity of it maybe allegedly i

109
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,840
had a friend that was growing a lot of

110
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,400
it and i would get a large quantity and

111
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,759
it would make the whole house smell

112
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,360
funky when you would drive with it in

113
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:12,479
the car you'd be psy would be so

114
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,480
paranoid it was like a gassy skunk dirty

115
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:16,639
diesel fuel sort of a thing it kind of

116
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:18,879
burns my eyes in a delightful way the

117
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,639
buzz gives me tunnel visions where all i

118
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:22,560
can focus on is what's right in front of

119
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:25,680
me and i can't even barely pay attention

120
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:28,079
to that i love good sour diesel stuff

121
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:31,680
now the question here is ah what strain

122
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:33,198
would you say would be close to that

123
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,519
i would like to make a lot of

124
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:38,720
recommendations unfortunately there's

125
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:40,399
nothing like real true real deal sour

126
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,120
diesel there's nothing like that so i

127
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:45,359
can't make a recommendation for anything

128
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,519
from my line currently that i would say

129
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,040
would be real deal true diesel i don't

130
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:51,519
want to mislead you lie to you give you

131
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,439
the wrong information i may allegedly

132
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:54,319
have crossed something with a diesel

133
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:55,918
plant

134
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:57,680
but it needs to be tested we need to see

135
00:04:55,918 --> 00:04:59,359
what it does it's still brand new it's

136
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,240
uh just happened it hasn't had time to

137
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,160

d-a-w-g

166
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,400
they may put two w's in the top dog and

167
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:08,079
you may not even notice that or they may

168
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:10,519
throw an underscore in a weird place

169
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:13,198
ivory underscore genetics is me i

170
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:14,879
read.genetics is not me so people on

171
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,600
instagram right now are really trying to

172
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:19,759
scam people who are looking to buy seeds

173
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,840
if a breeder posts a photo and then

174
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,759
somebody says hey where can i find this

175
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:25,519
there is a scammer that follows up right

176
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,080
away and says hey i've got it message me

177
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:29,758
here and those most likely are not the

178
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:31,199
breeders we're not really

179
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,199
the breeders don't do a lot of sales

180
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,800
online i can't speak for everybody but

181
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,319
most of the breeders do their sales

182
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,639
through the vendors most of us have a

183
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,479
website you can hit the website there is

184
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,240

i'm not gonna say any names but a friend

229
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:17,360
was scammed out of a nice portion of

230
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:19,038
money uh somebody on social media was

231
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,120
claiming to be iriegenetics

232
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:22,800
unfortunately that was a fake account

233
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,399
i saw them on a live feed they said hey

234
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,960
did you send my package and i was like i

235
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:28,478
didn't send any package uh politely went

236
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:30,560
and we did some messaging and they sent

237
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:32,240
me screenshots somebody was pretending

238
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,000
to be me that wasn't me so be very

239
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,000
careful if you're purchasing seeds out

240
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,240

breeding part of this podcast

262
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:20,159
this message came from the man with no

263
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:22,399
name it says hey i love the podcast and

264

the plants you put out bro thank you

265
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:27,679
that's a great compliment it says my

266
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:30,319
question is i have an ac infinity fan a

267
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:33,120
six inch ac infinity fan i'm using a

268
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,519
three by three tent i used the ac

269
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:38,000
infiniti and my four by four currently

270
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:41,278
i'm having problems with nanners really

271
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,639
bad since i got the ac infinity okay so

272
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:44,559
you've got you're ending up with

273
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:47,199
intersex plants ever since you got that

274
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:50,079
ac infinity fan

275
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:52,959
it goes on to say if the fan outtake is

276
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:55,360
sucking in the sides of the tent can and

277
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:57,359
will that cause manners and by nanowrist

278
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,919
he means intersex plants hermaphroditic

279
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,839
plants uh it says i've stopped i've had

280
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:03,519
the speed control on the lowest setting

281
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,200
thank you and then it talks about some

282
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,440
other strains he's grown now let's talk

283
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,200
about this just briefly the sides of the

284
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,640
tent being sucked in are not a problem

285
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,040
that is negative pressure if you've got

286
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:15,600
your carbon filter inside the tent

287
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:16,799
uh then you're sucking in uh it's

288
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,560
working very that's a good thing don't

289
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:21,199
worry about that that's not a problem

290
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:23,199
and no that should will not cause

291
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,440
intersex plants if you've got quality

292
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,879
genetics that should not be the cause

293
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,959
i'm thinking since you've introduced

294
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:31,519
this new fan there is some sort of a

295
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:33,039
light leak would be my first assumption

296
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,120
i don't know what else got adjusted

297
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:37,199
during this i don't know where the ac

298
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,639
infinity controller is there are a lot

299
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,879
of things that i would investigate but

300
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:42,559
my very first assumption would be that

301
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:44,320
you have now got a light leak that you

302
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:46,319
have not yet discovered

303
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,480
so i would see where that ac infinity

304
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,560
controller is is that inside the tent if

305
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,959
it's in the tent it is coming on during

306
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:55,759
your night cycle and that is giving you

307
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:57,759
your intersex traits um you've got the

308
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:58,958
new the new blower

309
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:00,720
excuse me for the throat clearing you

310
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:03,359
guys i've been dabbing my face off this

311
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,959
weekend uh you've got that new blower uh

312
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,399
how is the ducting ran now is the

313
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:07,838
ducting going a different direction

314
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,679
where you're getting light through the

315
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:12,399
ducting or did you open a flap that

316
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:13,759
wasn't open before uh maybe i just

317
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,000
thought of this while i'm talking my way

318
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:18,000
through it the tent is sucking in on

319
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,679
itself the tents usually have flaps on

320
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,958
the bottom are they opening up so much

321
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:23,519
that you're allowing light in through

322
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:26,559
the bottom it's really unlikely probably

323
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:28,959
not the cause but uh my main if you're

324
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:31,119
getting intersex plants now that you

325
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:33,039
weren't getting before this piece of

326
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,560
equipment i'm going to assume it's a

327
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:36,240
light leak that is going to be my very

328
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:38,399
first assumption

329
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,839
i actually like to see the walls of the

330
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:41,519
tent suck in a little bit when i'm

331
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,800
growing that lets me know first of all

332
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,759
it lets me know i'm getting enough

333
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:47,838
suction power i'm pushing out more air

334
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:49,200
than i'm able to pull in right because

335
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,880
it's struggling to get air so it's just

336
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,720
caving in because so much air is going

337
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:54,240
out that means that all of the air going

338
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,480
out is getting carbon filtered and i'm

339
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,919
replacing that air just [ __ ] as

340
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,519
quickly as possible as it can be

341
00:11:57,919 --> 00:12:01,599
replaced in that tin it's coming i keep

342
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,440
making this motion uh that's air coming

343
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,800
in through the bottom going up going

344
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,720
through the carbon filter going out of

345
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:08,240
the ducting going out of that tent and

346
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,160
then wherever you've got it directed if

347
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,839
it's out of the house out of uh into the

348
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:13,439
attic out of a window or just back into

349
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:15,760
the room which could work if you do that

350
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,040
properly if you recondition that air and

351
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:18,319
then blow it back into the tent that

352
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:20,078
would work for you

353
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,120
heat rises lower errors at the bottom

354
00:12:20,078 --> 00:12:22,638
you can figure out how to make that

355
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,959
happen for you

356
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:26,879
but overall i really don't think that

357
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:28,479
that suction is ever going to cause you

358
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:30,799
intersex traits i've been doing that

359
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,320
sort of a thing in uh intense four years

360
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:34,240
i don't have any tents running right now

361
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,399
which is kind of weird uh i've usually

362
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,759
got ten a tent going somewhere and i

363
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,440
always have it kind of sucking in a

364
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:41,600
little bit it's where when you unzip it

365
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,760
you kind of hear the tank go ah i was

366
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,360
getting sucked in a lot i do like that

367
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:46,639
uh negative pressure is what that is

368
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,560
called so that's not a problem that

369
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,480
shouldn't be causing it i really really

370
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:52,078
think it is you if you've ran these

371
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,480
plants before and you haven't ran into

372
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:56,638
intersex issues i'm going to assume

373
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:59,440
there is a light leak so go in there go

374
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:01,278
in the tent uh during your night cycle

375
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,200
when the lights should be off go in the

376
00:13:01,278 --> 00:13:05,439
tent if you can if you can fit in there

377
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,399
i'm 6'5 it's hard as [ __ ] for me to go

378
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,320
in the tent

379
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:10,480
but go in the tent uh maybe you can look

380
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,720
around during the light cycle and see

381
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,240
what's in there is there an extension

382
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,759
cord that's got a light on it is there a

383
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,278
piece of equipment that lights up do you

384
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:18,639
have a do you have a hygrometer do you

385
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:20,240
have a thermostat do you have any sort

386
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,680
of equipment that is in there that's got

387
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,759
any kind of lighting on it does your

388
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:25,759
dehumidifier have a light on it do you

389
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:27,519
have anything in there that is producing

390
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:30,399
any kind of light during the dark cycle

391
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:32,159
because i really do believe it is a

392
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:33,919
light leak so if you can fit in there if

393
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:36,319
you can stand in that tent

394
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:37,919
in that space if you're i wouldn't fit

395
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,680
if you can fit in there go in there and

396
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:41,278
turn off the lights in the grow space

397
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:42,638
and leave the outside lights however

398
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:44,799
they would be in that room and see if

399
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:46,399
you're getting any light in that space

400
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:48,399
stand in there for three to five minutes

401
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,399
cover your eyes let them adjust when you

402
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,559
open them up do you see any any any

403
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:54,799
light at all if you can see your hand in

404
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:57,119
front of your face during the dark cycle

405
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:58,958
that is too much light also sometimes

406
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,959
those tents are not completely light

407
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:02,638
proof a lot of times i'll get just a

408
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:04,399
black sheet and put it over it sometimes

409
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,759
you got to run a strip of duct tape

410
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:07,360
right down the edge of the where the

411
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:09,519
zippers are just to cover up some light

412
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,039
leaks a lot of times near the corners

413
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:12,320
where the seams are kind of pulling like

414
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:13,759
where there's a lot of stress of one

415
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,120
seam going this way and one going that

416
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:17,120
way at a corner

417
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,799
you'll get some stretchiness of the uh

418
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,639
the material and you'll get like light

419
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:22,479
leaks down there that was harder to say

420
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,399
than it looked but you'll figure it out

421
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,839
so check for leaks that is my main

422
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:28,000
assumption i think i've spent enough

423
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:31,519
time saying light leaks on this one so

424
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,879
to my friend the man with no name big up

425
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:35,120
thank you for the message i hope we have

426
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:36,879
solved your problem if it is not a light

427
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,959
leak send me another message of course

428
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:40,519
the email address is grow from your

429
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:42,399
heart at

430
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:43,679
hotmail.com

431
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,278
all right now let's jump into the part

432
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:46,799
of the podcast that everybody has been

433
00:14:45,278 --> 00:14:49,600
waiting for the part that i teased at

434
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:51,599
the top of the show i do have a breeding

435
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,399
question for you we've got a friend who

436
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,560
is breeding with the australian bastard

437
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:57,919
cannabis plant before i get too far into

438
00:14:56,559 --> 00:15:00,000
this let's talk about the australian

439
00:14:57,919 --> 00:15:01,360
bastard just briefly uh you may have

440
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,958
seen pictures of it you may have heard

441
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,759
about it you may have read about it you

442
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:07,518
may have seen our friend trey kdgc uh

443
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:09,360
highly ganginous she changed her social

444
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:11,759
media name and it threw me off uh big

445
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,360
shout out to trey k dgc she grew the

446
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:15,360
australian bastard she's playing with

447
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,600
the bastard

448
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,600
it is a very interesting looking

449
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,759
cannabis plant it does not produce

450
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,600
normal-looking cannabis leaves they are

451
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:24,879
kind of kind of ferny they look like

452
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,120
something you'd find out in a rain

453
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:28,639
forest or if you're walking along out in

454
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,919
oregon or something it looks like a very

455
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:34,320
organy

456
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:35,679
mossy area kind of a plant in my opinion

457
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,120
once again excuse me for the throat

458
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:40,239
clearing i will just blame that on the

459
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,679
dabs all day it's been a good weekend um

460
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,519
anyway it looks more like a plant that

461
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:44,958
you would find in a mossy area or

462
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,720
something like that in my opinion it

463
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:48,319
looks like something uh that grandma

464
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,160
might have in the mix of houseplants or

465
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,480
something like that so it doesn't really

466
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:54,719
look like a traditional cannabis plant

467
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,879
everybody that i've seen grow it uh it

468
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,480
does produce buds it doesn't produce an

469
00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:01,039
amazing amount of trichomes or anything

470
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:03,199
like that but it does produce a very

471
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:06,159
unique looking plant so that is a

472
00:16:03,198 --> 00:16:09,120
preface if you will for this email now

473
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:10,799
let's jump into the email part of this

474
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,039
question it goes

475
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:16,879
what's up bro i hope all is well i want

476
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:18,639
to try breeding out for the first time

477
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:21,439
this is going to be a very interesting

478
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:24,560
experiment for your first time breeding

479
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:27,279
i don't know that i would recommend this

480
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:28,879
for your first time although uh i'm the

481
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:31,120
kind of person that wants you to have

482
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:32,399
fun and do your thing i would recommend

483
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,039
to uh

484
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,799
more regular cannabis plants things that

485
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:37,919
you're gonna have just we'll talk about

486
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:39,198
why in the future just because you're

487
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:40,958
gonna have to breed this multiple

488
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:42,958
generations to see the results that you

489
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:45,679
want if that's what you're looking for

490
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:47,119
that's cool um that may be frustrating

491
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:49,198
it may be discouraging if you want to

492
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,039
see some results on the first run i

493
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:53,198
would work with regular plants but i'm

494
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:55,360
kind of uh no do your thing bro have fun

495
00:16:53,198 --> 00:16:57,039
and do your thing live your dreams live

496
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,480
your best life you only live once all

497
00:16:57,039 --> 00:17:00,319
that good stuff

498
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,399
anyway don't let me discourage you uh

499
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,959
that's just my advice it says i do want

500
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,959
to use humboldt seed company's freak

501
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,558
show it's kind of looks like a fern if

502
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,480
you haven't seen it yes i know exactly

503
00:17:08,558 --> 00:17:11,678
what you're talking about a great plant

504
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,439
there are a couple of people out there

505
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,439
putting different versions of the freak

506
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:18,079
show out says i'm not really sure what

507
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:20,880
else i'm going to use anyway my question

508
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:23,119
is how do i get the offspring to look

509
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,559
like the freak show that is a really

510
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:26,879
good question

511
00:17:24,558 --> 00:17:28,558
most of the time i would draw a punnett

512
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,600
square and we'll talk about punnett

513
00:17:28,558 --> 00:17:31,440
squares in the future i'm not going to

514
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:32,719
teach a full punnett square and i would

515
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,880
be able to tell

516
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,480
i would be able to predict a lot of what

517
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,080
the plants are going to look like and a

518
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,880
lot of what the genetics are going to do

519
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:42,960
based on a punnett square also based on

520
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,559
so when i teach about breeding i say

521
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,600
learn about mendel charts and punnett

522
00:17:44,558 --> 00:17:47,119
squares

523
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:48,639
learn about the way that the plants work

524
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:50,798
together when you breed them just learn

525
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:53,038
about the scientific part of that then i

526
00:17:50,798 --> 00:17:55,359
follow that up by saying uh when you're

527
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:57,839
breeding forget all of that and use your

528
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:59,439
intuition because that's really uh i

529
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:01,519
find that to be super important as well

530
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,798
as a breeder i'd like to say that i'm a

531
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:04,480
successful breeder i've made some

532
00:18:02,798 --> 00:18:05,839
crosses that are out there that are

533
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,279
paying some bills and people are really

534
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:10,000
happy with them so we'll call that a

535
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:12,160
success right um i've got intuition i

536
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,679
can just see some plants it's like have

537
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,080
you ever known two people and you're

538
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:17,600
like hey you and hey you if you guys met

539
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:19,439
it's gonna be [ __ ] a match made in

540
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:20,719
heaven and you introduce two people like

541
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,919
five years later they're married and

542
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,600
they got a family and you're like yeah

543
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:25,120
i'm kind of happy that i did that like i

544
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:26,639
feel like i've got that ability with

545
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:29,038
plants i understand the mental charts

546
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,919
the alien charts i understand that sort

547
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:32,960
of stuff but also i can intuitively see

548
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:35,038
the things that are going to kind of

549
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,720
happen with these plants

550
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:38,960
working with the australian bastard

551
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:41,360
however brings a lot of variables i'm

552
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,960
not familiar with that plant at all i

553
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:45,038
don't know a lot about its heritage its

554
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,360
history where it came from which helps

555
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:49,279
me a lot as a breeder as a grower to

556
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:50,719
kind of uh predict a little bit it's

557
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:51,918
like a lot of information it tells you a

558
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,440
lot of things about a plant when you

559
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:55,679
know its genetics its parents where it

560
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,120
came from on the planet uh what a lot of

561
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,480
it tell it lets you know a lot about

562
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:01,599
what to expect from it but with the

563
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:04,000
bastard i didn't know so i wrote um we

564
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:06,480
would have to find out if that funky

565
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,919
leaf trait that ferny leaf uh there's a

566
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,519
technical word for it we've gotten

567
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,880
what's the word that i found i learned

568
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:12,720
this word

569
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,919
um i can't find the word in this it'll

570
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,679
pop up when i read this i don't want to

571
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,600
lose my place though there's a word for

572
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:19,440
that funky leaf we have to find out we

573
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:21,119
have to determine if that is a recessive

574
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,720
or a dominant trait the way to find that

575
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:24,399
out basically is by

576
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,519
growing out a batch of it and breeding

577
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,280
with it and playing with it you have to

578
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:28,400
have experience with it

579
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:30,240
um

580
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,960
so then we have to decide do you want to

581
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,160
use a male or a female of the australian

582
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,038
bastard

583
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,798
then

584
00:19:35,038 --> 00:19:38,400
from some i talked to a friend who is

585
00:19:36,798 --> 00:19:40,720
grown and bred with the australian

586
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,240
bastard cannabis i'm leading up to that

587
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,919
i was going to wonder if you want to use

588
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,599
the male or the female then it turns out

589
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,600
that you're going to have to do some

590
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:49,599
f2ing before you even get a good

591
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:50,798
standard plant to start with

592
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:52,240
um

593
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:54,000
something i did want to talk about

594
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,200
before we get too far and i don't want

595
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,359
to discourage you from the bad the

596
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:00,558
australian bastard cannabis but i've

597
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:02,240
never seen anybody post pictures of

598
00:20:00,558 --> 00:20:04,158
finished and i'm not talking trash this

599
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,919
is my experience on social media

600
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:07,760
nobody's ever posted a finished product

601
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:10,080
they've been like look at this amazing

602
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:12,879
australian bastard cannabis i've seen a

603
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:14,399
lot of people post like week five six

604
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,400
and seven photos and they're like look

605
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,480
at this crazy [ __ ] and then the pictures

606
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,400
kind of taper off it doesn't seem like

607
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:23,200
too many people are blown away ecstatic

608
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:25,120
super satisfied uh braggadocious about

609
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,480
the final product i'm not really trying

610
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:28,639
to talk [ __ ] i'm just saying that's what

611
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,159
i've experienced on the internet nobody

612
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,840
seems to the pictures are great but

613
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:33,360
nobody's like man when i smoke this i'm

614
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:35,199
on the moon i haven't really seen

615
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:37,359
anybody ecstatic and in love with the uh

616
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,679
bastard cannabis in that aspect it's

617
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:41,119
really cool for photos i may be cool for

618
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:43,200
breeding but i haven't seen anybody

619
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:44,479
blown away by any of the quality that's

620
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,919
just my opinion if you've got some

621
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,000
australian bastard cannabis out there

622
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:50,159
that blew your mind correct me send me a

623
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,640
photo send me an email grow from your

624
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:54,080
heart at hotmail.com i look forward to

625
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,679
friendly corrections and feedback i

626
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:57,439
invite that if you're just going to tell

627
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,120
me i'm a dick because i just said that

628
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,880
have some photos and something to back

629
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:03,119
it up i'm all about it let's be friendly

630
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,039
with each other i like that um let's

631
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:06,879
find my place in this message

632
00:21:05,038 --> 00:21:08,240
okay so um you're gonna have to get

633
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,679
yourself some australian bastard

634
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,798
cannabis seeds that's probably how

635
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:12,559
you're gonna have to do this then you're

636
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:15,119
gonna have to grow them out

637
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:17,119
find a plant with the traits you were

638
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:18,479
looking for hopefully find a male and a

639
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:20,479
female with the traits you're looking

640
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:23,519
for and then you're gonna have to breed

641
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,960
those together uh you can at the same

642
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:26,879
time while you're doing this you can

643
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:29,679
pollinate other plants

644
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:32,240
but um those aren't gonna have the

645
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:33,440
bastard trait as strongly from some of

646
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,038
the advice i was given you're going to

647
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,640
have to make f2s before you can even

648
00:21:35,038 --> 00:21:38,158
bring out that trade

649
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,280
to get it to pass

650
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:41,039
um

651
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:41,839
let me jump into this message that our

652
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:43,440
friend

653
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:45,038
i was talking with our friend locomotive

654
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,120
medical has been doing some breeding

655
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:48,558
with the freak show i just reached out

656
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:50,558
to a member of the team because i knew

657
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:51,918
somebody was working with it and i said

658
00:21:50,558 --> 00:21:53,440
what can you tell me about breeding with

659
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:55,280
the freak show because i have a question

660
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,440
and here's what my friend locomotive

661
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:59,759
medical had to say it says the freak

662
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:02,200
show or the pinion leaf trait that's the

663
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:04,960
word i was looking for pin it

664
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:07,679
p-i-n-n-a-t-e pin it leaf trait is

665
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:09,759
recessive or at best and incomplete

666
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:12,640
dominant when you cross it with

667
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:16,319
traditional palmet plants the palmett

668
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:18,799
trait dominates the f1s and the f1s

669
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:21,519
mostly look normal so if you cross it

670
00:22:18,798 --> 00:22:23,839
with anything one time that offspring is

671
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:25,679
going to look mostly like a normal

672
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:28,158
cannabis plant you may see some outliers

673
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:30,480
that do pop up with the bastard trait

674
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:33,360
but overall it sounds like most of them

675
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:36,240
are going to look mostly normal now it

676
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:38,240
says the f2s have some strange plants

677
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,079
and 25

678
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,240
freaks so this is where you're going to

679
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:44,240
start finding plants that you can narrow

680
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,079
down and isolate the uh the leaf

681
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,519
structure you're looking for

682
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:48,639
now you're also going to have to think

683
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:51,359
about

684
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:53,520
the terps the potency the structure of

685
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:56,479
the plant this leaf structure is just

686
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:58,158
one thing on a big chess board of traits

687
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:01,200
that we're looking for for a successful

688
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:02,880
plant that leaf trait is cool but what

689
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,558
else you want it to smoke good smell

690
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,840
good tastes good you got to get high as

691
00:23:04,558 --> 00:23:07,279
[ __ ] from it or it's got to have a lot

692
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:08,480
of cbd or

693
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:09,918
a specific

694
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,440
something really high in a specific

695
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:13,360
cannabinoid or a certain interpreter

696
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,960
it's got to blow your mind in some way

697
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:16,399
it's got to produce seven pounds of

698
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,519
light or something like that to make it

699
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,200
stand out

700
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:21,440
make it a good plant overall it's got to

701
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,840
be pathogen resistant it's got to handle

702
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,120
nutrients well it's got to be growable

703
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:26,879
it's got to be enjoyable it's got to be

704
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:28,959
a good plant so that's just one trait is

705
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:33,280
the leaf that we're looking for so the

706
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:35,200
f2s will have some strange plants and 25

707
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:38,000
freaks so at this point i would find

708
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,679
another uh a male and a female that both

709
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
look like that have the leaf trait

710
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:43,679
you're looking for that pin it leaf uh

711
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,319
structure and i would breed those

712
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:49,120
together and make f3 now it says

713
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:50,558
f3 you can stabilize for that trait by

714
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:52,558
f3

715
00:23:50,558 --> 00:23:54,798
similar to autoflower and photoperiod

716
00:23:52,558 --> 00:23:57,359
outcross projects work so

717
00:23:54,798 --> 00:23:58,319
by f3 you can lock it down

718
00:23:57,359 --> 00:24:00,798
but

719
00:23:58,319 --> 00:24:02,558
the first cross is going to look just

720
00:24:00,798 --> 00:24:04,240
like normal plants you may find a couple

721
00:24:02,558 --> 00:24:06,798
of weirdos in there but then you gotta

722
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,720
cross it again to start getting more of

723
00:24:06,798 --> 00:24:10,879
that freak trade you're not gonna see it

724
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,798
until the second and then the third one

725
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:15,440
you can lock it in and my friend says

726
00:24:12,798 --> 00:24:17,200
that's about all the tips i have for the

727
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,960
australian bastard cannabis that he does

728
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,640
so big shout out to my buddy locomotive

729
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,880
medical for having great info on

730
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:25,120
breeding um let's jump more back into

731
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,400
your message uh you want the traits to

732
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:28,000
come out you're trying to make it look

733
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,840
like the freak show so you're going to

734
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,119
take the freak to another plant the

735
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:33,678
first time you do that you're only going

736
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:35,119
to get about 25 percent freaks find a

737
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:36,559
freak that you like the one that works

738
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:39,278
the best for you

739
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:40,960
find a male and a female do that again

740
00:24:39,278 --> 00:24:43,038
then find another male and a female they

741
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,880
work best for you and do that again by

742
00:24:43,038 --> 00:24:46,400
the time you get to the f3 the seeds

743
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:49,120
that come out after that

744
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,960
should be quite a bit freak show

745
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:52,558
uniformity then you can find the

746
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,759
phenotype that works the best for you

747
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:55,519
out of there

748
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:57,278
then you can do a lot of things you can

749
00:24:55,519 --> 00:24:59,200
self that you can start back crossing

750
00:24:57,278 --> 00:25:00,880
things once you've got that gem that is

751
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,200
exactly what you're looking for which is

752
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,720
probably around the f3 range

753
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,240
then you can start doing a lot of fun

754
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,480
things with it

755
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,798
so i hope i did not discourage you by

756
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,798
giving you such a long path to success

757
00:25:10,798 --> 00:25:14,798
maybe you're the kind of person that

758
00:25:12,798 --> 00:25:15,918
enjoys a really long project like that a

759
00:25:14,798 --> 00:25:17,359
lot of people

760
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:19,520
want to chuck some pollen make some

761
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:20,959
seeds and see what they made that is fun

762
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:23,119
f1s are great there's a lot of fun

763
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,558
diversity in there if you trust and know

764
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:26,479
your parent plants you can make some

765
00:25:24,558 --> 00:25:27,839
great things

766
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,599
if you can predict what you're going to

767
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:32,399
make with an f1 if you can kind of write

768
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:34,000
down i think like my goal is this and if

769
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,240
it comes out like that that's fine make

770
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,159
f ones that are predictable uh that is a

771
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,240
good uh that's a that's a good product

772
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:42,799
in my opinion some people are not into

773
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:44,798
the f1s but um anyway i'm kind of

774
00:25:42,798 --> 00:25:46,879
rambling if you're if you're excited

775
00:25:44,798 --> 00:25:48,720
about having a long project i encourage

776
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:51,360
you to do this but for my first breeding

777
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:54,240
project i don't know that i would work

778
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:56,158
with this uh australian bastard cannabis

779
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,759
i may work with something different if

780
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:59,200
your goal is to fix the australian

781
00:25:57,759 --> 00:26:01,200
bastard because i did say that i've

782
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,720
never seen one that impresses me when

783
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,960
it's finished i'm really not trying to

784
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,880
be rude i'm just saying uh we see a lot

785
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,079
of people post their grows and then we

786
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,600
see it all the way up to the end and

787
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:10,960
then we get to see them like harvest it

788
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:13,278
in the pictures they post a picture of

789
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,720
them holding the buds we don't see a lot

790
00:26:13,278 --> 00:26:16,640
of that with the australian bastard they

791
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,919
all quit posting their pictures around i

792
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,278
don't know right after the buds start

793
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:21,278
forming and kind of where they should

794
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:23,278
get chunky and then they just fizzle out

795
00:26:21,278 --> 00:26:25,278
with the photos not being hateful just

796
00:26:23,278 --> 00:26:27,599
saying that's what i have seen mostly uh

797
00:26:25,278 --> 00:26:29,519
so uh maybe you can be the person that

798
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:31,038
breeds something to it to correct it

799
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:33,278
maybe you can still get that australian

800
00:26:31,038 --> 00:26:34,960
bastard cannabis leaf structure and the

801
00:26:33,278 --> 00:26:36,720
growth the vigor the potency of some of

802
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,400
the other hype strains popular strains

803
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,558
productive strains that are on the

804
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,080
market now if that is your goal i do

805
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:43,678
wish you the best of luck if i can give

806
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:45,839
you any other guidance because i do not

807
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:48,000
mean to ever discourage anybody i would

808
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:49,678
just rather set you up for success

809
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,599
in your first run than watch you stumble

810
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:53,200
and be frustrated so if i can give you

811
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:54,959
any other guidance any other advice

812
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,720
please do reach out i look forward to

813

hearing back from you you know the email
