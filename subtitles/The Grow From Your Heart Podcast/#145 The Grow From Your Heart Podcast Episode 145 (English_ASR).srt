with information I'm gonna do an episode

23
00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:00,329
about an email I got about making

24
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:01,950
feminized seeds and selecting phenotypes

25
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:04,049
for seeds and seed breeding and

26
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:05,700
feminized seed making this one was right

27
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:07,530
up my alley so I took a lot of notes

28
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,510
this would be a great episode in my

29
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:11,189
opinion I'm excited to do it but before

30
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:13,020
we get that far let's talk about the

31
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:15,239
secret sessions a secret session was

32
00:01:13,019 --> 00:01:17,009
just a few days ago and in my opinion

33
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:17,939
this was the best secret session we've

34
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:19,650
done in Colorado

35
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:22,079
you know the session the secret session

36
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:23,280
on 421 the day after 4/20 that was

37
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:25,109
pretty [ __ ] fantastic

38
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,700
but that was the day after 4/20 there

39
00:01:25,109 --> 00:01:28,379
were a lot of really cool people in town

40
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,150
that wouldn't normally be here we had a

41
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:31,649
lot of extra height because of 4/20

42
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:33,330
weekend a lot of extra momentum that

43
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,790
really helped us out it was a little

44
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:38,728
over overhyped and too big for me I like

45
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:40,440
a smaller more intimate event so without

46
00:01:38,728 --> 00:01:41,909
all the hustle and bustle this was my

47
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:43,079
favorite secret session I think there

48
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:44,609
were plenty of people there the place

49
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:46,349
was packed but it was a little more

50
00:01:44,609 --> 00:01:48,510
intimate there was more room to dab more

51
00:01:46,349 --> 00:01:50,309
room to chill out I was a little quieter

52
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:51,570
you could go get some quiet space and

53
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:54,030
talk to some people if you wanted to I

54
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:56,309
really enjoyed that so huge shot it to

00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:07,530
Bobo if people if the session people

166
00:05:06,269 --> 00:05:08,579
just walked by you and hand you edibles

167
00:05:07,529 --> 00:05:10,349
they're like yo you need some edibles

168
00:05:08,579 --> 00:05:11,759
bro and I will take but then if I'm not

169
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:13,500
an edible zone that night I just pass

170
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,899
them on to friends Bobo got all of my

171
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:18,569
excess edibles he was a lit up that's

172
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:20,219
pretty fun I'm afraid you guys I ate a

173
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:22,560
bunch of edibles at the last secret

174
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:24,419
session I I don't even know a lot of

175
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,100
edibles I had a lot of THC in my body

176
00:05:24,418 --> 00:05:28,829
I'm gonna guess somewhere between 800

177
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:30,840
and 1500 milligrams of THC in my body I

178
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:33,180
was challenged I was having a rough time

179
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:35,579
and then our friends at teensy TNT

180
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:37,168
extracts gave me a 1000 milligram edible

181
00:05:35,579 --> 00:05:39,089
and I ate it for breakfast the next day

182
00:05:37,168 --> 00:05:41,430
on my way to work and by the time I got

183
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:43,409
to work it felt like I had wrapped a

184
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:45,780
vise around my brain and I was trying to

185
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:47,400
function on half speed all day so I've

186
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:48,509
been afraid of edibles since then to

187
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:50,969
tell you the truth and I haven't eaten

188
00:05:48,509 --> 00:05:52,560
any it's been quite a while I don't know

189
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:54,690
if I'll do it for a little while

190
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,100
probably go see fish and eat a couple

191
00:05:54,689 --> 00:05:58,379
hundred milligrams at the fish that

192
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:00,120
might be what has to happen all right

193
00:05:58,379 --> 00:06:01,079
you guys let's get to the point let's

194
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,610
get to the point the point of this

195
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:03,779
podcast I received an email from a

196
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:06,270
friend let me open up this email I've

197
00:06:03,779 --> 00:06:08,279
got a save right here on the phone this

198
00:06:06,269 --> 00:06:09,449
dude signed his name as just a noob

199
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:11,969
trying to learn and then he called

200
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:13,529
himself ban so noob trying to learn this

201
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:15,450
question was great you asked a lot of

202
00:06:13,529 --> 00:06:17,579
great [ __ ] and you really sparked a

203
00:06:15,449 --> 00:06:19,379
great podcast in my opinion so let me

204
00:06:17,579 --> 00:06:21,149
read the email the email goes like this

205
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:22,918
greetings Jeff first off I want to say

206
00:06:21,149 --> 00:06:24,418
thank you for the kick-ass podcast and

207
00:06:22,918 --> 00:06:26,490
then you have taught me so much in these

208
00:06:24,418 --> 00:06:28,469
weekly sessions they make my Monday

209
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:29,850
morning commute tolerable dude that's

210
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:31,169
why I put him out Monday morning so your

211
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:32,850
weekend doesn't hire you sue your week

212
00:06:31,168 --> 00:06:34,199
doesn't have to start with a shitty

213
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:36,120
Monday you start off with some kick-ass

214
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:38,339
podcast material I'm glad you noticed

215
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:40,470
thanks for checking it out so he goes on

216
00:06:38,339 --> 00:06:42,209
to say while I have yet to grow by

217
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:43,860
because of where I live the topic none

218
00:06:42,209 --> 00:06:46,288
less consumes much of my thoughts and I

219
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:47,340
tried to learn everything I can much of

220
00:06:46,288 --> 00:06:49,589
the gained knowledge has led to

221
00:06:47,339 --> 00:06:52,049
practices that have benefited my outdoor

222
00:06:49,589 --> 00:06:55,228
vegetable garden even still I have what

223
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:57,000
may seem to be a stupid question dude

224
00:06:55,228 --> 00:06:58,348
your question is not stupid I was so

225
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,819
excited when I read this I was like oh I

226
00:06:58,348 --> 00:07:01,709
know a lot about this and I'm gonna get

227
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:03,419
to ramble on for a long time so I'm

228
00:07:01,709 --> 00:07:05,189
gonna continue with email it says it

229
00:07:03,418 --> 00:07:07,109
seems that many strains are named for a

230
00:07:05,189 --> 00:07:08,699
special phenotypically Express trait

231
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:10,740
that manifests any particular smell

232
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:12,300
flavor or color now if you're lucky

233
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:14,038
enough to find one of those desirable

234
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:16,020
phenotypes the strain is known for when

235
00:07:14,038 --> 00:07:18,060
popping seeds it seems that you can

236
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:20,909
enjoy that treat continually if you had

237
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:23,060
the foresight to take clones absolutely

238
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:26,400
correct that's why I encourage everybody

239
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:27,959
every time you grow a seed every time it

240
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:29,638
gets big enough to take a clone you take

241
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:31,079
a clone off of it before you flower it

242
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:33,810
because you don't know if that seed is

243
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:35,969
going to bear the most amazing cannabis

244
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:37,319
you have ever smoked in your life and if

245
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:38,849
you don't have a clone of it you might

246
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:40,050
try to kick yourself in the ass and

247
00:07:38,848 --> 00:07:42,269
you're gonna be kind of mad about it

248
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:45,180
it's heartbreaking when you don't get a

249
00:07:42,269 --> 00:07:48,149
cut of your of this super amazing herb I

250
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:49,348
grew some excuse me for the throat

251
00:07:48,149 --> 00:07:50,969
clearing of course that's a bunch of

252
00:07:49,348 --> 00:07:53,699
dads sorry about that

253
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:56,940
I grew some Holy Grail cush from DNA

254
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:58,889
genetics and it was honestly superb

255
00:07:56,939 --> 00:08:00,658
cannabis if you can get your hands on

256
00:07:58,889 --> 00:08:01,769
some Holy Grail cush seeds I recommend

257
00:08:00,658 --> 00:08:03,180
that from that from another breeder

258
00:08:01,769 --> 00:08:04,889
that's not even my brand get that from

259
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:07,680
DNA to genetics and maybe a reserve a

260
00:08:04,889 --> 00:08:09,180
privada project by now but a Holy Grail

261
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,668
cush get the real deal the old-school

262
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:14,400
[ __ ] from DNA genetics it's amazing

263
00:08:11,668 --> 00:08:17,069
cannabis I could not get the phenotype I

264
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:18,839
selected would not make clones they

265
00:08:17,069 --> 00:08:20,848
would not root for [ __ ] I put them in

266
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:22,679
rock wool they'd shriveled up I put them

267
00:08:20,848 --> 00:08:24,959
in a cloner they got funky and fell

268
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:26,550
apart I could not get that [ __ ] to clone

269
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:29,430
I'll never get to taste that flavor

270
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:30,840
again my friend pops is an old guy he

271
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:33,120
says that was one of the top-five best

272
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:34,769
pots he's ever smoked and Pop's isn't

273
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,450
all dude and hard to impress so the Holy

274
00:08:34,769 --> 00:08:38,668
Grail cush was some special [ __ ] I could

275
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:41,370
not get it to root I wish I had a clone

276
00:08:38,668 --> 00:08:44,069
of that it is gone one of my favorite

277
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:46,019
strains ever was the pea 91 and there

278
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:48,300
were some serious raids of large grow

279
00:08:46,019 --> 00:08:50,370
facilities in the p90 one rumor has it

280
00:08:48,299 --> 00:08:52,588
was lost in that raid somebody claims to

281
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:55,440
have it but I really don't know if that

282
00:08:52,589 --> 00:08:56,080
is what they have got anybody can claim

283
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,610
to have it

284
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,019
so let's talk about something else you

285
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:00,639
said in here it seems that the strains

286
00:08:59,019 --> 00:09:02,620
are named for a special phenotypically

287
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:04,240
expressed trade yes that's why the Sour

288
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:06,278
Diesel is called Sour Diesel because it

289
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,539
smells like diesel fuel I think they

290
00:09:06,278 --> 00:09:09,039
tried to name the Girl Scout cookies

291
00:09:07,539 --> 00:09:10,389
that because they wanted us to think

292
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:11,799
that it tastes like Girl Scout cookies

293
00:09:10,389 --> 00:09:13,600
it's a little bit they called the Thin

294
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:14,919
Mint cut if he could the Finn mint they

295
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,430
tasted the Finn mint cookies and the

296
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:20,559
Thin Mint cut it could be close so that

297
00:09:18,429 --> 00:09:22,569
part is totally accurate now here's

298
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:23,799
where what I really uh what I really

299
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:25,930
like to get into in this part of the

300
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:27,669
email it says ah

301
00:09:25,929 --> 00:09:29,229
if the traits are passed from mother to

302
00:09:27,669 --> 00:09:31,449
clone would it be likely that the same

303
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:33,339
traits would be present in nearly 100%

304
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:38,980
of the seeds if you were to make

305
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:41,079
feminized seeds from this plant you

306
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:42,789
would hope so because of logic but that

307
00:09:41,078 --> 00:09:43,838
is not accurate and I took a bunch of

308
00:09:42,789 --> 00:09:44,949
notes and I'll get into that I'm gonna

309
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,029
have to take a break here in a second

310
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:47,379
take a drink but let me keep reading the

311
00:09:46,028 --> 00:09:48,789
email and then I'll take a drink take a

312
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:49,958
quick break just cuz you guys don't

313
00:09:48,789 --> 00:09:52,719
wanna hear me clear my throat a thousand

314
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:54,939
more times the email goes on to say my

315
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:57,610
logic may be way off on this as I am NOT

316
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:59,470
a botanist or geneticist but if if it

317
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:00,970
does play out like this then why don't

318
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:02,980
the seed companies grow out several

319
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:04,899
plants to find that rare phenotype and

320
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:07,600
then make feminized seeds from that

321
00:10:04,899 --> 00:10:10,179
plant any knowledge you can drop will be

322
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,310
greatly appreciated thanks bro from just

323
00:10:10,179 --> 00:10:14,379
a noob trying to learn then he signs it

324
00:10:12,309 --> 00:10:15,759
Ben noob this is a great question I'm

325
00:10:14,379 --> 00:10:16,809
gonna press pause for just a second here

326
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:19,689
take a drink and then I'll be right back

327
00:10:16,809 --> 00:10:21,159
all right you guys I'm back took a big

328
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:22,209
fresh drink I feel like I'm better I'll

329
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:23,860
be better for a minute I'm gonna take a

330
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:25,239
DAB and [ __ ] it all up again but I'm

331
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:26,950
better for now alright let's get back to

332
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:28,629
this email the part that got my

333
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:30,040
attention here at the end said if the

334
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:31,659
traits are passed from mother to clone

335
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:33,730
would it be likely that the same traits

336
00:10:31,659 --> 00:10:37,899
would be present in nearly 100% of the

337
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:40,300
seeds no a clone you're taking a cutting

338
00:10:37,899 --> 00:10:41,528
from an existing plant and that plant is

339
00:10:40,299 --> 00:10:43,569
making a root of course right and then

340
00:10:41,528 --> 00:10:44,828
you're getting a clone so all the traits

341
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:47,379
are passed because there is no

342
00:10:44,828 --> 00:10:50,588
opportunity for any other chromosomes or

343
00:10:47,379 --> 00:10:53,470
genetics or traits to be introduced into

344
00:10:50,589 --> 00:10:55,899
that cut there's nothing you're not

345
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:57,278
gonna pull DNA out of the air to change

346
00:10:55,899 --> 00:10:59,440
the trait so yes that one will be

347
00:10:57,278 --> 00:11:01,750
exactly like the mother that it came

348
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,640
from now when we're working with seeds

349
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:06,750
we have the opportunity for variation

350
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:09,698
because we're using pollen that has

351
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:11,318
chromosomes from the grandparent

352
00:11:09,698 --> 00:11:12,758
you're not only giving parents not

353
00:11:11,318 --> 00:11:14,799
you'll not only getting chromosomes from

354
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:16,749
that selected phenotype but you're

355
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:19,178
getting chromosomes from whatever that

356
00:11:16,749 --> 00:11:20,829
plant is a cross up so let me back up a

357
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:22,600
little bit something that I want to

358
00:11:20,828 --> 00:11:24,698
mention we do search for those selected

359
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:27,790
phenotypes that you mentioned right now

360
00:11:24,698 --> 00:11:29,828
I'm making a rise f2s which means I made

361
00:11:27,789 --> 00:11:32,379
in a rise plant or rot and a rise strain

362
00:11:29,828 --> 00:11:34,599
which I took Daybreaker as the male and

363
00:11:32,379 --> 00:11:37,539
I put Daybreaker pollen on a golden goat

364
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:40,178
female and I took those seeds and what

365
00:11:37,539 --> 00:11:42,669
came out of that I named that arise so I

366
00:11:40,178 --> 00:11:44,649
found a beautiful male I've got a studly

367
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:47,349
male he produces the structure I want

368
00:11:44,649 --> 00:11:49,178
the aroma I want he makes resin this

369
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:51,999
male plant is a stud so I've got that

370
00:11:49,178 --> 00:11:54,369
and then I've got I think right now I've

371
00:11:51,999 --> 00:11:56,308
got three or four gorgeous arise females

372
00:11:54,369 --> 00:11:58,569
that I need to pull it pick one of those

373
00:11:56,308 --> 00:12:00,399
because I want to take that a rise male

374
00:11:58,568 --> 00:12:03,519
and I want to put that pollen on that

375
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:05,049
arise female and make a rise f2s and I'm

376
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:07,269
doing that by selecting the perfect

377
00:12:05,049 --> 00:12:08,769
phenotype of the perfect male and the

378
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:10,629
perfect female to bring out the traits

379
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:11,919
that I'm looking for now I could screw

380
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:13,389
that all up I could bring out a bunch of

381
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:14,678
recessive traits and it could be a total

382
00:12:13,389 --> 00:12:15,938
disaster and I'll have to go back and

383
00:12:14,678 --> 00:12:18,220
find a different male and female and do

384
00:12:15,938 --> 00:12:20,169
it all over again but that's why I grow

385
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:21,790
out a bunch of them myself before I try

386
00:12:20,169 --> 00:12:23,860
to sell them or give them away to

387
00:12:21,789 --> 00:12:25,118
anybody I make sure to dry probably a

388
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:28,178
hundred of those by myself before

389
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:29,889
anybody else will even see them so we do

390
00:12:28,178 --> 00:12:32,588
look for those phenotypes we find those

391
00:12:29,889 --> 00:12:34,448
perfect phenotypes and sometimes a cross

392
00:12:32,589 --> 00:12:35,920
will be made that wasn't intended to

393
00:12:34,448 --> 00:12:37,328
smell like something I don't think that

394
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:38,769
tangi I don't think that the guy that

395
00:12:37,328 --> 00:12:40,359
made tangi I think that was Crockett I

396
00:12:38,769 --> 00:12:42,850
don't think Crockett was like I want to

397
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:45,579
make tangi I think tangi should be Caleo

398
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:48,428
and this whatever the hell are used I

399
00:12:45,578 --> 00:12:49,778
forgot but this orange plant uh I don't

400
00:12:48,428 --> 00:12:51,068
think he was like I want to make tangi I

401
00:12:49,778 --> 00:12:52,448
think he crossed some [ __ ] and it came

402
00:12:51,068 --> 00:12:54,039
out and tastes like tangerines and he's

403
00:12:52,448 --> 00:12:55,659
like that's tangi I think that's how

404
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:56,740
that came I don't think Sour Diesel I

405
00:12:55,659 --> 00:12:58,178
don't think anybody was like I want to

406
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:59,919
make it strain that tastes like diesel

407
00:12:58,178 --> 00:13:02,078
feel I think it was actually named

408
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:03,789
because of that so they selected that

409
00:13:02,078 --> 00:13:07,208
one now let's talk about something else

410
00:13:03,789 --> 00:13:09,938
you said why don't we use those selected

411
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:11,828
phenotypes we do and then if I'm gonna

412
00:13:09,938 --> 00:13:14,588
make feminized seeds from that selected

413
00:13:11,828 --> 00:13:16,269
phenotype I'm going to treat so I'm

414
00:13:14,589 --> 00:13:17,860
gonna take two clones of the same plant

415
00:13:16,269 --> 00:13:19,389
the selected phenotype that has the

416
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:21,668
traits that we like the one that so

417
00:13:19,389 --> 00:13:23,320
we'll say grateful dog I've made

418
00:13:21,668 --> 00:13:24,789
feminized seeds of grateful dog

419
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:26,199
I've grown a bunch of my own grateful

420
00:13:24,789 --> 00:13:28,838
dog seeds I found the one that is

421
00:13:26,198 --> 00:13:30,789
stellar so I take two clones of that I

422
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:33,070
reverse one and I put that reversed

423
00:13:30,789 --> 00:13:37,088
pollen onto the female grateful dog and

424
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:39,639
now I make grateful dog seeds now

425
00:13:37,089 --> 00:13:42,190
sometimes those grateful dog seeds look

426
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:43,899
like chem dog and sometimes those

427
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:46,029
grateful dog seeds look a little bit

428
00:13:43,899 --> 00:13:49,120
more like San Fernando Valley OG Kush

429
00:13:46,028 --> 00:13:51,549
but a lot of them look very much like

430
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,019
the grateful dog clone that I reversed

431
00:13:51,549 --> 00:13:54,969
and started with and then will get a

432
00:13:53,019 --> 00:13:56,980
little a little bit of variation that's

433
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:58,690
a little closer to the chem but more og

434
00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:00,039
and then a little more og but closer to

435
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:01,810
the cam and then you'll see blends of

436
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:03,219
the traits it's kind of like making kids

437
00:14:01,809 --> 00:14:04,419
you know like your sister might look a

438
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:05,500
little different from you but you could

439
00:14:04,419 --> 00:14:07,629
definitely tell you're from the same

440
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:09,250
gene pool it's just gonna vary a little

441
00:14:07,629 --> 00:14:10,568
bit more from so you're gonna see traits

442
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:12,339
of grandmas what I'm saying you're gonna

443
00:14:10,568 --> 00:14:14,469
see traits of grandpa's what I'm saying

444
00:14:12,339 --> 00:14:16,600
and sometimes you might see great

445
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:18,129
grandparent traits so let me refer back

446
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,259
to my notes here to keep myself on topic

447
00:14:18,129 --> 00:14:22,480
because I'm getting way way off of what

448
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:23,919
I'm trying to say so we do search for

449
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,769
those phenotypes so that's how we make

450
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:30,458
our f 2s and then we do reverse those to

451
00:14:26,769 --> 00:14:34,060
make our feminized seeds I breed with my

452
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:35,439
second and third generations from those

453
00:14:34,059 --> 00:14:37,119
select I make my second and third

454
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,230
generations from those selected plants

455
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,028
and I was talking about picking one

456
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:41,589
female and one female something else or

457
00:14:40,028 --> 00:14:44,948
one male and one female something else I

458
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:47,649
also do I will take multiple females of

459
00:14:44,948 --> 00:14:49,539
the same strain and one male of that

460
00:14:47,649 --> 00:14:52,208
strain and hit three or four different

461
00:14:49,539 --> 00:14:54,519
females with that male pollen and that

462
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:56,379
way I've got I can see the variation I

463
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:58,600
can see that this girl produces more

464
00:14:56,379 --> 00:15:00,610
resinous offspring I can see that this

465
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,810
girl produces tall and lanky offspring

466
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:03,009
so I don't want to breed to that one

467
00:15:01,809 --> 00:15:04,179
again let's go ahead and get rid of that

468
00:15:03,009 --> 00:15:06,698
I could see that this one over here

469
00:15:04,179 --> 00:15:07,958
produces really lanky plants that stink

470
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:09,278
really well but don't make a lot of

471
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:11,679
resins so maybe I don't want to breed to

472
00:15:09,278 --> 00:15:13,778
that one so I'll go and hit multiple

473
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:16,539
females so that way I could find the

474
00:15:13,778 --> 00:15:19,149
best breeding plants that I can use so

475
00:15:16,539 --> 00:15:20,889
I'll also hit different females of

476
00:15:19,149 --> 00:15:23,649
different strains in that room with that

477
00:15:20,889 --> 00:15:25,000
male so I'll put four females so when I

478
00:15:23,649 --> 00:15:26,980
do this over eyes f2 it's about to

479
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,870
happen pretty soon I'll probably put two

480
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:30,639
maybe three females of a rise in there

481
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:32,620
to be honest and then I'm gonna probably

482
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,209
put seven or eight maybe nine or ten

483
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:35,409
females of other strains in there there

484
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:35,778
will be a grateful dog in there I'm

485
00:15:35,409 --> 00:15:37,100
gonna put

486
00:15:35,778 --> 00:15:39,289
Goldin go in there to take it backwards

487
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:40,459
a little bit I've got some other stuff

488
00:15:39,289 --> 00:15:42,860
that's gonna go in there I've got some

489
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:44,388
crosses I made that'll go in there then

490
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:46,639
I'm gonna hit all of those with pollen

491
00:15:44,389 --> 00:15:48,560
and then we'll see what comes of all of

492
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:50,180
that progeny there'll be a whole bunch

493
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:52,399
of great stuff in it all right let's get

494
00:15:50,179 --> 00:15:54,349
myself back on track he said my logic

495
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:56,360
may be way off on this but I am NOT a

496
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:57,649
botanist or geneticist which I like they

497
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:59,209
said but if it does play all like this

498
00:15:57,649 --> 00:16:00,708
then why don't the seed companies grow

499
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:02,208
out several plants to find the rare

500
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:04,849
phenotypes and then make feminized seeds

501
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:07,278
from that plant well that's kind of

502
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:09,139
exactly what they slash we do my friend

503
00:16:07,278 --> 00:16:10,610
I hope I explained that in a way that

504
00:16:09,139 --> 00:16:11,839
makes a lot of sense to you one thing I

505
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:13,519
want to go back over is the word

506
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:17,209
phenotype I hear a lot of people say

507
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:19,850
phenome it's a fimo Phe and fnot

508
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:22,518
phenotype a phenotypic expression

509
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:25,819
fino not phenome just just to make you

510
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:27,169
something cooler in your circle so when

511
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:28,998
you're making seeds and those seeds do

512
00:16:27,169 --> 00:16:30,799
come out of course variation is natural

513
00:16:28,999 --> 00:16:32,629
that's something that we expect we can't

514
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:34,429
control it completely if you want to

515
00:16:32,629 --> 00:16:36,139
make something that I did that I didn't

516
00:16:34,429 --> 00:16:37,099
even realize I was kind of I was doing

517
00:16:36,139 --> 00:16:38,749
something out of the norm

518
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:42,558
I made feminized seeds and then I found

519
00:16:38,749 --> 00:16:44,329
my favorite my favorite phenotype out of

520
00:16:42,558 --> 00:16:46,938
that batch of feminized seeds and then I

521
00:16:44,328 --> 00:16:48,679
hit that feminized plant with the

522
00:16:46,938 --> 00:16:50,958
original pollen that I made feminized

523
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:53,688
seeds from and the progeny from that was

524
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:55,458
super stable and I did it again and then

525
00:16:53,688 --> 00:16:57,139
I tried to reverse one of those plants

526
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:59,268
and I could not get it to reverse I

527
00:16:57,139 --> 00:17:01,188
could not make the plant herm I could

528
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:02,629
not change the sex of that plant to make

529
00:17:01,188 --> 00:17:05,240
more feminized seeds with that

530
00:17:02,629 --> 00:17:06,980
generation of that progeny and it was

531
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:09,109
super impressed with the stability of

532
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:11,899
that plan that plan is still around it's

533
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:13,729
been named GD 77 a lot of people ask me

534
00:17:11,898 --> 00:17:18,408
about my naming schemes they're very

535
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:19,880
random grateful dog was Gd 1977 is one

536
00:17:18,409 --> 00:17:23,089
of my favorite years of the Grateful

537
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:26,240
Dead so GD 77 it's the Grateful Dead 77

538
00:17:23,088 --> 00:17:27,648
female I love it it's in the mother room

539
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,808
right now that's one of my favorite

540
00:17:27,648 --> 00:17:31,428
keepers I've probably had that one for I

541
00:17:29,808 --> 00:17:32,509
don't even know how long I really can't

542
00:17:31,429 --> 00:17:35,000
remember I've had it for a super long

543
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:36,920
time long time eight years I'll say

544
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,809
eight years I've had that clone

545
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,800
let's get back on track here I like the

546
00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:41,119
variation that's what I'm saying

547
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:42,740
variation is cool when you're making

548
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:44,239
seeds I like variation I don't want

549
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:45,700
every seed to grow out just like the

550
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,839
picture in the package because

551
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:49,190
everyone's got that one I want a little

552
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:50,449
bit of variation that means that the

553
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:51,980
grower down the street that bought those

554
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:54,110
seeds doesn't have the phenotype that

555
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:55,759
I've got and that means that there might

556
00:17:54,109 --> 00:17:57,259
be something better in there that means

557
00:17:55,759 --> 00:17:58,519
you can always keep growing more seeds

558
00:17:57,259 --> 00:17:59,960
that's why always that's why I love see

559
00:17:58,519 --> 00:18:01,460
you might find something better than

560
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:03,259
what you've already got

561
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:04,460
sometimes if somebody loses a plant or

562
00:18:03,259 --> 00:18:06,019
if something doesn't root when you try

563
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:07,610
to clone it I always look at the bright

564
00:18:06,019 --> 00:18:09,920
side that means I get to grow more seeds

565
00:18:07,609 --> 00:18:11,329
because see the way to go seeds have

566
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:13,130
vigor you can find new [ __ ] in there

567
00:18:11,329 --> 00:18:15,049
every every strain that you're smoking

568
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:18,620
every clone that you've ever grown that

569
00:18:15,049 --> 00:18:20,599
came from a seed right it had to so uh

570
00:18:18,619 --> 00:18:23,089
the variation of course you could

571
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:24,889
stabilize that just by by breeding make

572
00:18:23,089 --> 00:18:26,990
f2s make f3s by the time you get to have

573
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:28,310
five those seeds will be super stable

574
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:30,799
you'll start making seeds that produce

575
00:18:28,309 --> 00:18:34,159
almost clones once you get to the f6

576
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:35,690
generation probably 90% of the seeds

577
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,220
that you plant are going to look just

578
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:39,200
like the picture on the package if the

579
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:40,250
breeder did it properly alright guys I'm

580

another email

614
00:20:10,289 --> 00:20:14,670
this one says Rasta Jay recently

615
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,740
discovered my latest batch of girls are

616
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:19,380
not as innocent as I would like yes they

617
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:21,150
are flat ass full of seeds my question

618
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:23,220
for you is if there are any dead

619
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:25,680
giveaways to determine if they were

620
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:27,750
pollinated or simply herm I did have a

621
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:30,120
sneaky male get by me until about week

622
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:31,829
three I had him labeled wrong and stuck

623
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:34,289
him in the flower room I'm hoping this

624
00:20:31,829 --> 00:20:36,359
is the case and not a her issue then he

625
00:20:34,289 --> 00:20:39,509
continues to give me reasons why his

626
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:41,099
plants may have harmed and Doody out of

627
00:20:39,509 --> 00:20:43,680
mail he [ __ ] up you got a boy in there

628
00:20:41,099 --> 00:20:45,509
that male at 3 weeks he busted or not be

629
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:47,700
pollinated your girls do you know what

630
00:20:45,509 --> 00:20:49,140
that male was that's my question now if

631
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,730
you know what that male plant was you

632
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:51,150
may have accidentally just bred some

keep those seeds the draw them out see

00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:55,559
what you got yeah I'm pretty sure that

636
00:20:54,029 --> 00:20:57,839
that maildrop pollen it only takes about

637
00:20:55,559 --> 00:20:59,399
14 days for some of those studly or

638
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:00,839
males to just start blowing pollen

639
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:03,030
everywhere so if you had them in there

640
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:04,980
until about week three I'm pretty sure

641
00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:06,990
that's who hit those girls with pollen

642
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:09,059
from the list of things you mentioned

643
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:12,240
that may be reasons why those plants

644
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:14,579
harmed it does not look like Lee to me

645
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,650
the recent switch of lighting that would

not do it the site Fox sailing emission

647
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:20,430
that's cuz they got too hot I don't

648
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:22,350
think that made them firm so you had a

649
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:25,230
dude in there you guys when you have

650
00:21:22,349 --> 00:21:26,129
male if you were growing from seed or if

651
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:28,079
you have a male plant

652
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:29,940
I have males in my stable I got a couple

653
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:31,470
big fat male arise plants in there I got

654
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:33,390
Solomon just chillin he's kicking it

655
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:34,799
it's like three feet tall but if you're

656
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:36,870
going from Seaton you got boy plants

657
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:38,849
those boy plants will drop pollen I've

658
00:21:36,869 --> 00:21:41,099
actually got a strawberry tangi banana

659
00:21:38,849 --> 00:21:42,419
male plant in a very small pot it's

660
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:45,509
getting root bound and I can see male

661
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:47,009
flower clusters forming on the top if I

662
00:21:45,509 --> 00:21:49,109
don't get that out of there in the next

663
00:21:47,009 --> 00:21:50,279
ten days he will drop all that pollen

664
00:21:49,109 --> 00:21:51,419
will come from there so if you're if

665
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:53,099
you're growing from seed keep an eye on

666
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:54,660
those pollen sacks and if you don't want

667
00:21:53,099 --> 00:21:57,209
seeded plants if you don't want pollen

668
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:58,710
don't be lazy get those males out of

669
00:21:57,210 --> 00:22:00,299
there this dude's a perfect example of

670
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:02,819
why you don't want to have males in your

671
00:22:00,299 --> 00:22:03,990
garden he's got seeds now that brings me

672
00:22:02,819 --> 00:22:04,829

if you want to go listen to 100 episodes

738
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:06,290
of the show I encourage you to go back

739
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:08,780
and listen to old episodes one of my

740
00:24:06,289 --> 00:24:12,680
favorites I think is the scheduling your

741
00:24:08,779 --> 00:24:13,789
perpetual grow episode that episode that

742
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:15,170
should have been a million dollar book

743
00:24:13,789 --> 00:24:16,759
idea so make sure you listen to that one

744
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:18,380
for me if you haven't heard that one go

745
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:20,359
listen to it that's that's a great

746
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:22,010
episode I think it's number 72 I'm gonna

747
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:23,149
be a responsible podcast host and press

748
00:24:22,009 --> 00:24:23,910
pause and go make sure what number that

749
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:25,740
is

750
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:27,029
alright I found the information I wanted

751
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:29,160
to find but I want to let you guys know

752
00:24:27,029 --> 00:24:31,950
something funny that I just did my buddy

753
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:34,200
John hunt gave me a pencil dabber it is

754
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:36,690
made out of green Stardust glass and

755
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:38,880
it's got some colored tips and a colored

756
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:40,798
eraser and or a colored tip where the

757
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,179
pencil mint would be the color tip of

758
00:24:40,798 --> 00:24:43,740
the eraser and would be it's made out of

759
00:24:42,179 --> 00:24:45,600
glass it's meant to be used as a dabber

760
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:47,038
and my high-ass just picked it up and

761
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:49,469
tried to write a [ __ ] note on my

762
00:24:47,038 --> 00:24:52,769
notepad with the dabber pencil so

763
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:54,569
