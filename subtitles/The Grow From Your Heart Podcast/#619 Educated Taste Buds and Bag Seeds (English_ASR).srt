117
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,159

118
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,560
single episode

119
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:36,239
but i hang out quite often i try to be

120
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,479
there every other episode

121
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,759
but scheduling life things are weird

122
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:41,280
sometimes they have another guest where

123
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:43,039
i feel like i could just let that guest

124
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,000
shine and i don't need to be there

125
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:46,798
what i'm getting at is on the embracing

126
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,120
organics

127
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,959
show that is coming up on thursday i am

128
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,640
recording today is the

129
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,719
uh 10th i believe the show will be on

130
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:56,158
the 11th by the time this comes out it

131
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:58,158
will already have happened

132
00:03:56,158 --> 00:04:00,479
but i encourage you to go back and watch

133
00:03:58,158 --> 00:04:02,560
it because if all things go correctly

134
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:04,479
we will be doing an edibles challenge on

135
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,039
that show and i will have eaten

136
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:08,798
a ridiculous amount of edibles and i

137
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:09,679
invite you to come hang out watch the

138
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:11,360

see what happened it hasn't happened yet

140
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,000
to be honest i'm talking to you in the

141
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,438
future

142
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,720
the show comes out in the future i'm

143
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:18,079

recorded in the future

145
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,120

146
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,560
good time so i encourage you

147

170
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:05,360

171
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,639
hello rasta man i know you're busy uh

172
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,720

00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,079
all for all you do and i know that your

174
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,080
time is valuable

175
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:13,599
so let's get right to the question thank

176
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:14,240
you man that's uh that makes it really

177
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,919
easy

178
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,840
big salute for that one it says i

179
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:18,959
believe that i missed a nanner somewhere

180
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:20,560
in my recent crop

181
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:22,719
because my wife and i have found some

182
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,560
seeds while trimming

183
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,479
first of all big shout out to your wife

184
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,839
for helping you trim trimming sucks and

185
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:28,319
if you can find someone to do it with

186
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:30,399
you

187
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:32,159
that's a good person that's a good wife

188
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:34,478
she deserves a hug and a high five buy

189
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,240
her some good food and some fancy shoes

190
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:38,319
because she's helping you trim that's an

191
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,079
awesome wife shout out to the trim crew

192
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:41,759
goes on to say i don't believe the

193
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:43,439
plants had any pollen sacks as i have

194
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,479
shown my wife what to look for in the

195
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:46,959
garden

196
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:48,079
but not nanners i'm also not ruling this

197
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:49,599
out either

198
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:52,079
so our friend thinks that they have

199
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,600
found possibly could have found uh

200
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:55,758
nanners or missed nanners in their

201
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,479
garden because they did find seeds

202
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,520
uh what do i mean by nanners nanners are

203
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:02,079
what we call

204
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:03,519
male flowers that pop up in a female

205
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:05,519
plant so the plant has got

206
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:07,359
intersex traits or herbaphroditic

207
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:08,639
tendencies it's got a it's a female

208
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,840
plant they just showed

209
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:13,360
male sex parts in flower so a nano we

210
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:14,399
call it a banana because it just looks

211
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,759
like a little banana

212
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:17,519
that pops up out of your flowers

213
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,960
oftentimes they come in clusters

214
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:20,399
and it looks like a little bunch of

215
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:21,599
hanging bananas so we call those a

216
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:24,079
banana

217
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,800
what we were talking about is a male

218
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:27,120
flower

219
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,879
or a male flower popping up on a female

220
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,759
plant that is now showing us that it is

221
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:34,000
hermaphroditic and that one manner that

222
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:36,560
one male flower can produce pollen

223
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,360
which will then produce seeds in our

224
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,680
garden

225
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,560
so our buddy tonto found a few seeds

226
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,000
while trimming

227
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,439
he doesn't believe he had any pollen

228
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,959
sacks because he's shown his wife what

229
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:46,000
to look for but she doesn't know to look

230
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:48,399
for nanners

231
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,759
so that is very possible a lot of things

232
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:50,399
could have caused this one of the plants

233
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,400
could have just

234
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:53,679
stressed out and seeded itself there

235
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:54,638
could have been pollen from another

236
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,079
plant somewhere

237
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,680
one of the plants could have hermed

238
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:58,959
there are a lot of opportunities to make

239
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,959
this happen until you

240
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:02,318
actually look really closely and realize

241
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:04,000
what happened you'll never know

242
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,080
unless you find the nanner find the

243
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,879
pollen chucker find the light leak find

244
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:08,959
the issue

245
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:10,159
it's going to be a big question mark but

246
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:12,079
here's what we can do

247
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,439
it says my question is would these seeds

248
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:15,918
be considered good

249
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:17,439
or would they be untrustworthy i did a

250
00:07:15,918 --> 00:07:19,038
quick google search but the results were

251
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:20,560
mainly forum based answers

252
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:22,639
which are always taken with the grain of

253
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,079
salt that is the way to take any forum

254
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:27,038
answers

255
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:28,240
social media answers forum answers [ __ ]

256
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:29,839
anything i say

257
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,519
should be taken with a grain of salt

258
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:32,959
always do your own research

259
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:35,198
always realize that those people are

260
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:36,638
doing things their way some people may

261
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,160
say oh you need to spray it with this

262
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,759
and do this but they have no idea what

263
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,400
you're doing and their suggestion may

264
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,038
[ __ ] you all

265
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:45,038
up so yes every piece of advice that you

266
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:47,918
read should be taken with a giant

267
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:49,439
chunk of salt it goes on to say i will

268
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:52,240
grow these out regardless

269
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:53,439
uh per out of pure curiosity and it is

270
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,960
my personal grow

271
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:56,959
i won't be giving these seeds or plant

272
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:58,560

that are available in these seeds

276
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,918

277

commercial grow and you will shine

308
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,240
now let's address the actual question

309
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:01,679
the issue at hand the reason this

310
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,519
message was sent

311
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:05,359
our buddy tanto has got some seeds that

312
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:06,399
randomly appeared in his garden

313
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,680
he doesn't know if there was a

314
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,720
hermaphrodite he doesn't know if there

315
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:10,719
was a light leak

316
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,320
we don't know what caused these seeds

317
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,560
these seeds will be known as

318
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,000
bag seed this is bag seed it's

319
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:17,679
questionable seeds we know what the

320
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,440
female plant was because we've got the

321
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:21,359
buds we can tell you that much of it

322
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,120
we do not know who the pollen donor was

323
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,759
we don't know who the baby daddy is

324
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,799
we got a mori povich situation here so

325
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:28,958
the question is

326
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:32,000
are these seeds worth the [ __ ] can i

327
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:34,879
trust them or are they problematic

328
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,360
i don't know just as much as you don't

329
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:36,720
know

330
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,399
i don't know what's in those seeds at

331
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,600
all they could be

332
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:43,600
uh feminized they could be intersex

333
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,320
they could be beautiful females they

334
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,080
could be amazing mutants they could be

335
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,399
the most amazing [ __ ] flowers you've

336
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:52,000
ever grown if you think about it

337
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,919
in my opinion to the best of my

338
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,399
knowledge all of the chem dog

339
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:58,399
lineage was a mistake those were seeds

340
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,720
that were found in buds read about chem

341
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,480
dog and the legend of the 13 seeds

342
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,079
you'll realize that a lot of the most

343
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,120
popular cannabis we were smoking

344
00:10:04,078 --> 00:10:08,958
came from what was known as bag seed

345
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,879
seeds that were accidentally made

346
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:12,799
chem dog bought a bag of weed he found

347
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:14,559
seeds in there he grew the seeds

348
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:16,958
those seeds became the popular chem

349
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:19,518
lines we work with now chem 91 kim d

350
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:21,199
kim's sister all came from a bag of weed

351
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,440
they were all bag seed

352
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,560
those are strains that set the precedent

353
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,959
and expectation

354
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:28,799
for the future of cannabis they changed

355
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:31,199
the world the landscape of growing

356
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:33,039
breeding cannabis production consumption

357
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,240
now all people want to talk about is

358
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:36,078
chem and kush

359
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,519
because chem dog found those seeds in

360
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:40,879
that bag of weed so

361
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:42,639
you could have the next chem dog golden

362
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:44,240
goat was an accident golden goat

363
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:45,519
happened in a very similar manner to

364
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,360
what your seeds did

365
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,720
we all know how popular and in demand

366
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,399
golden goat is

367
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,879
i think girl scout cookies was an

368
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,958
accident gorilla glue number four

369
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:55,919
was an accident so there are a lot of

370
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:58,319
things that were

371
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:59,039
bred created this way there were

372
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,160
accidents

373
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:03,278
and they became stellar products so you

374
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:06,078
could have some

375
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:06,559
complete [ __ ] or you could have the

376
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:08,799
next

377
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:09,919
legend in that bag of seeds that you

378
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:12,000
have got there

379
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:13,599
you're doing it the right way don't give

380
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,360
them out don't let other people have

381
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,639
them because they could be problematic

382
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,079
also don't let other people have them

383
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:19,439
because they could be the [ __ ] gems

384
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:21,599
that make you famous

385
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,480
ah but you're doing it right grow them

386
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,000
yourself

387
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,320
keep a good eye on them while you're

388
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,240
growing know that you've got big

389
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,839
question marks on those seeds they were

390
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,680
free but they could be

391
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,360
hermaphrodites they could be intersex

392
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:35,919
they could be ticking time bombs

393
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,720
or they could be ticking awards i don't

394
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:38,719
really know

395
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,959
what else to other advice to give you

396
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,800
because uh until you grow them you do

397
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:43,599
not know that is the beauty of a bag

398
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:45,759
seed

399
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,519
so just like those forum members were

400
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:49,039
saying it could be anything and take all

401
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,278
of that advice with a grain of salt and

402
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:53,199
again take mine with a grain of salt

403
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:54,320
there's no way to tell what's in there

404
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,759
they could be amazing

405
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,079
they could be females they could be

406
00:11:55,759 --> 00:12:00,000
males the way to do it is to grow it out

407
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:02,159
pay close attention to it through the

408
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,600
entire cycle now is when you really have

409
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:04,559
to start learning how to pay attention

410
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,079
to nanners

411
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:07,599
teach the wife what to look for in

412
00:12:06,078 --> 00:12:10,159
intersex plants

413
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,079
look high look low anytime you stress

414
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:13,519
that plan out do anything weird do it

415
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:15,519
watch how it responds make sure you

416
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:17,200
don't get any hermaphroditism

417
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,879
any intersex traits you don't see any

418
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,680
manners it doesn't go completely weird

419
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:22,159
on you

420
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:23,838
also take a lot of pictures of it

421
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:25,199
because you might want to document this

422
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:27,040
because you may have

423
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,040
hot fire in there you may have the next

424
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:32,078
chem dog you may have the next girl

425
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:35,199
scout cookies golden goat gorilla glue

426
00:12:32,078 --> 00:12:36,479
uh og tonto's kush going on in there and

427
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,800
we don't even know it yet

428
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,680
so grow those out and see what you've

429
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:41,359
got and

430
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:42,719
take clones when you grow them because

431
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,360
what if you're growing the most amazing

432
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,360
[ __ ] ever

433
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,120
and you don't have a clone on of it that

434
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,440
is going to be completely heartbreaking

435
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,360
so my buddy tonto my advice is grow them

436
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,440
see what you got get some clones and if

437
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,759
they're worth the [ __ ] grow them forever

438
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,360
then send me a clone if it's hot fire

439
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:57,919
all right the wraps it up with i hope

440
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,800

441
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:01,679

let's see whose name they want me to use

454
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:25,600
they didn't sign it with the name so

455
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,680
we're going to skip that part

456
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,360
it goes a lot like this it says yo rasta

457

475
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,759

476
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,399
education and kill time while you're in

477

483
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:15,679
it says

484
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:17,719
um my question can you suggest a source

485
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:19,039
for genetics that are in close

486
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:22,240
representation

487
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:24,000
to key cannabis flavors so that say i

488
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:27,360
wanted to grow a good kush

489
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,639
or other key can so uh okay

490
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,680
i kind of stumbled on part of what he's

491
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,399
saying here but you guys are getting the

492
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:32,399
point

493
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,679
i wanted to grow a good kush or other

494
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,120
key cannabis flavors

495
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:37,039
much like you've done with the golden

496
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,320
goat strain so what this person

497
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:41,198
basically wants to do it says

498
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,800
i want to where is it i want to build i

499
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:44,078

500
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:46,078

00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:47,198
studies their palette for wine did i say

502
00:14:46,078 --> 00:14:48,319
that word correctly because i just read

503
00:14:47,198 --> 00:14:50,078
it off the page and i think i got it

504
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,920
right i didn't even study that one

505
00:14:50,078 --> 00:14:53,120
until legalization you just got what the

506
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:54,719
guy had but now

507
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,560
with the passion for growing i'd like to

508
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,720
build my palette so that when the bud

509
00:14:56,559 --> 00:14:59,919
tender says this is the gaseous gas or

510
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,440
the stinkiest cush

511
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:03,360
i can know if they're telling the truth

512
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,600
or just trying to make a sale

513
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,680
your golden goat is up next in my garden

514
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,519
much love and keep it ire this is a

515
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:11,838
great interesting question

516
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:14,000
especially for me since i talk a lot

517
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:15,440
about terps and flavors and aromas

518
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,600
and people tell me that i've got a

519
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,120
magical terp nose or that i smell terps

520
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,399
and flavors differently that i taste

521
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,320
things a little bit

522
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,679
more vividly than a lot of people we

523
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,360
recently discovered that i have got

524
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:27,039
something called synesthesia where i

525
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,800
smell and taste in colors

526
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:31,278
so my palate and my tasting and

527
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:33,039
flavoring thing is vivid and quite more

528
00:15:31,278 --> 00:15:34,958
active than a lot of people

529
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:36,639
so i like this question talking about

530
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:39,758
how to develop your palate

531
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:40,000
and understand the flavors i thought

532
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,839
about

533
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,078
how to go about doing this and the only

534
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:46,240
way i can think of doing this is

535
00:15:44,078 --> 00:15:48,078
try a lot of samples this is going to be

536
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,680
the fun part the way that the sommelier

537
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:50,399
gets good with wine is he tries a lot of

538
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:52,078
samples

539
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:53,679
with the sommelier he takes a little sip

540
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:55,758
swishes it around gets a taste

541
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:57,439
spits that [ __ ] out the fun part about

542
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,639
being the weed sommanier

543
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,000
is we're going to take a dab we're going

544
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:01,680
to smoke a bowl we're going to hold that

545
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,600
[ __ ] in and get the buzz and enjoy it

546
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:06,078
we don't have to spit it out every time

547
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:08,240
so the first thing that i would say is

548
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:09,359
smoke a lot of product you're gonna have

549
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,440
to uh

550
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,560
travel around to a lot of places and buy

551
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,160
a lot of product

552
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:15,838
whenever you're you say you travel

553
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:16,879
around a lot stop at a dispensary

554
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:18,320
everywhere you go

555
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:19,278
and get something if you can afford it i

556
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,480
don't know what your budget is i don't

557
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:23,039
know what you're trying to do but

558
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:25,120
get as much product as you can get just

559
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:27,679
grab an eighth or a gram here and there

560
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,278
and make sure they're well labeled maybe

561
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:31,439
when you go to the dispensary get

562
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:32,958
two different products that are vastly

563
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,120
different get a cushy thing

564
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:37,119
and a bubble gum flavored thing or like

565
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,078
a golden goat and an og kush you got

566
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,600
that tropical

567
00:16:38,078 --> 00:16:41,359
and that funky so you can really tell

568
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,000
there's a difference this is going to

569
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,320
tell you

570
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,440
if the dispensary and that grow has a

571
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,040
difference in their product because a

572
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,440
lot of dispensaries all the product will

573
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:49,679
taste

574
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,440
very similar so now you've got a

575
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:53,198
guideline on how their product tastes if

576
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,639
it's all similar or if it's different

577
00:16:53,198 --> 00:16:56,319
then you can smoke those two different

578
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,079
products and you can see

579
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,360
how does the og kush taste you can kind

580
00:16:58,078 --> 00:17:01,919
of say i bought

581
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:04,160
jeff so g at this place it tastes gassy

582
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:06,159
cushy mothballs and swamp and then i

583
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,959
bought strawberry starburst at this

584
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,400
other place

585
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,839
and it tastes just like a strawberry

586
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,798
starburst to make notes then go to

587
00:17:09,838 --> 00:17:12,480
another place

588
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:14,400
and buy another kind of kush and another

589
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,558
fruity thing and make notes on those

590
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,000
and try to just remember when i smoked

591
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:19,519
the strawberry one it tastes like

592
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,519
strawberry bubble gum when i smoke the

593
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:23,599
og kush it tastes like mothballs

594
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:25,679
just develop that palette smoke a lot of

595
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:27,279
samples smoke a lot of strains

596
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:29,120
but what you're gonna have to do is

597
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:30,240
verify that what you're smoking is

598
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:31,599
actually what

599
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,480
you think you're smoking some

600
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:37,279
dispensaries anything with the word og

601
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:39,038
or chem will sell so if i've got

602
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:39,678
strawberry something and it's not

603
00:17:39,038 --> 00:17:41,119
selling

604
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,720
i'm gonna put the word strawberry kush

605
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:44,239
on it it will sell more quickly

606
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,000
and the dispensary will trick you and

607
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,839
now your research is kind of tainted

608
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,319
so you're gonna have to smoke a lot of

609
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:52,240
samples and develop develop that palette

610
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:53,359
just by smoking it that's the way that

611
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,480
foodies do it that's the way the

612
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:56,319
sommelier does it

613
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,319
just a lot of consumption a lot of

614
00:17:56,319 --> 00:18:00,240
memory a lot of note taking

615
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:01,359
a lot of experience experience builds a

616
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,798
lot experience is

617
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:04,079
something you can't buy it's something

618
00:18:02,798 --> 00:18:05,679
that you just have to do and that

619
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:07,119
develops a lot of uh

620
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:09,440
details a lot of knowledge the

621
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:11,599
experience will develop your knowledge

622
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,840
so try a lot of samples develop that

623
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:14,639
palette for various notes look for

624
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:17,359
things

625
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,880
uh try to be able to identify gas you

626
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:20,879
want to be able to smoke gas and fuel

627
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,919
identify that gas everybody wants gas

628
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,559
and fuel

629
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:26,000
then be able to identify earth look for

630
00:18:24,558 --> 00:18:28,079
that like earthy

631
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,919
sort of earthy dirt coffee sort of a

632
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:30,960
smell be able to identify that in your

633
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:33,759
cannabis

634
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,360
then be able to identify the fruitier

635
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:36,798
flavors that come from cannabis you're

636
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:39,038
going to get your strawberries

637
00:18:36,798 --> 00:18:40,319
your blueberries your oranges try to

638
00:18:39,038 --> 00:18:42,960
identify that

639
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:44,480
then get good at finding the floral

640
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,919
notes that come from cannabis

641
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,839
so now you're kind of breaking it into

642
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:49,759
categories we're getting that earthy

643
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:51,918
stuff we're getting the gassy stuff

644
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:54,000
once you've got categories then you can

645
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:56,400
kind of say well this og kush falls in

646
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
the earthy gassy category the strawberry

647
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,280
starburst was in the berries

648
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,519
and floral maybe a little bit of

649
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:02,480
tropical category then you can start

650
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:04,798
kind of making

651
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,599
subcategories once you get the gas you

652
00:19:04,798 --> 00:19:08,079
can go with

653
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:10,319
chemicals and diesel fuel or regular

654
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:12,000
feel or cleaners and [ __ ] like that

655
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:14,159
then once you get earth dialed in you'll

656
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,640
taste like dirt and mud

657
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,919
and swamp and mothballs and then you

658
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,799
break off into like

659
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:22,640
feet and funky [ __ ] like that then once

660
00:19:20,798 --> 00:19:23,679
you get that fruity palette developed

661
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,759
you'll be able to tell the difference

662
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:26,720
between like oranges and blueberries and

663
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:28,240
strawberries

664
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,160
that's one that'll come natural to you

665
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,839
you're already tasting those things

666
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,600
all the time in your life everything is

667
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:35,599
flavored with berries and fruits

668
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:37,759
so those flavors and aromas should be

669
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:39,678
easy to discern and separate and

670
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:41,440
identify so you got your fruity palate

671
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:44,798
then that breaks down into like

672
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:46,240
berries tropicals and citrus then

673
00:19:44,798 --> 00:19:47,359
you're also going to get that floral

674
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,919
thing where you're going to get stuff

675
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:50,159
like

676
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:52,240
lavender and lilacs and you're going to

677
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,640
get those hints of perfumey things

678
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,919
so basically start finding categories to

679
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,600
put flavors into

680
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:59,759
then find subcategories for those

681
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:02,240
flavors and smoke a lot of [ __ ]

682
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:03,440
and see which categories those fall into

683
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,960
you'll make your own

684
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,880
kind of bracketing system your own

685
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,480
judging system and you'll find out how

686
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,080
to categorize all this stuff in your

687
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,279
head how to compartmentalize all of your

688
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:13,599
notes in your head

689
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:15,440
but really just start smoking it with

690
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:17,839
purpose pay attention

691
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,279
um have a clean bowl a clean pipe or a

692
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:20,079
clean bong whichever your preferred

693
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:21,839
method is

694
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:23,678
clean your damn dab rig i see a lot of

695
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:25,918
bongs pipes and rigs that are filthy i'm

696
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,720
[ __ ] guilty my dab rig gets so dirty

697
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,400
sometimes

698
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,159
but clean that [ __ ] up and your product

699
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,519
will taste better ah you'll just get

700
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:32,240
more flavor out of it you'll get those

701
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:35,359
terps

702
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,919
so um just buy a lot of [ __ ] and smoke

703
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:37,279
it dude

704
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:39,200
i know that doesn't sound like a real

705
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:41,200
scientific approach but uh

706
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,960
experience will build your knowledge so

707
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,159
just find the things you want to smoke

708
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,798
and smoke them and then you'll start

709
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,799
seeing that

710
00:20:44,798 --> 00:20:48,000
things that say kush kind of fall into

711
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:51,359
this cushy bracket there's

712
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:54,640
like a a dirty foot swampy

713
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:55,918
mothball gassy sort of a thing that

714
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,120
happens with kush and then you'll find

715
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:59,360
out that all the diesels

716
00:20:57,119 --> 00:21:00,479
have this diesel sort of aroma you'll

717
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:03,038
find that hazes

718
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,159
have sort of a spicy sandalwood sort of

719
00:21:03,038 --> 00:21:05,839
a peppery

720
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:07,919
uh maybe you'll get a lavender smell out

721
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:08,558
of some some hazes also but you'll start

722
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,640
finding

723
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:11,918
the commonalities in all of these things

724
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,000
then you'll start being able to smoke

725
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:15,600
something you'll take here you go

726
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,200
oh man i could taste the chem dog in

727
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:17,759
that and you'll get there you'll really

728
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,200
get there

729
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:22,720
then one day maybe once you're around it

730
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,240
a lot if you're in different grows

731
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,880
exposed to different nutrients and

732
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,919
products

733
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,720
you'll take your hit off the joint

734
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:30,320
you'll go damn you guys used way too

735
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,519
many worm castings in that

736
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:32,960
that's the kind of palette that you'll

737
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:34,480
be able to develop in the future i can

738
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,558
taste certain nutrients i can taste

739
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,960
products that were used in the grow

740
00:21:36,558 --> 00:21:40,798
it's all about experience and you don't

741
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,840
know what [ __ ] smells like

742
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:43,279
excuse me you don't know what [ __ ]

743
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:44,558
smells like unless you've smelled some

744
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:45,759
[ __ ] so you got to get out in the world

745
00:21:44,558 --> 00:21:47,918
and smell things

746
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:49,759
smell products when you're at the store

747
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:52,159
take a minute just smell the oranges

748
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:53,759
smell the bananas smell the watermelons

749
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,440
i know we all think we know what they

750
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:57,119
smell like but just smell stuff

751
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,640
just take a time take a minute and then

752
00:21:57,119 --> 00:21:59,759
just enjoy things when you're walking

753
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,000
around the flowers

754
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:03,679
pick up a wildflower give it a smell

755
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,359
enjoy that simple stuff also when the

756
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:07,120
ladies see you taking a moment to just

757
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:08,639
stop and smell the flowers they see

758
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:10,399
something in you you're enjoying and

759
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,240
appreciating the world around you

760
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,159
enjoy that world appreciate it put your

761
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,720
phone away for a moment and smell some

762
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:16,880
stuff

763
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,000
add that to your your arsenal your

764
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,640
repertoire your

765
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,558
memory your uh your aromatic memory i

766
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,120
guess we're gonna call it your olfactory

767
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:25,038
memory

768
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:26,719
that way when you smell that in cannabis

769
00:22:25,038 --> 00:22:28,879
you can go oh that smells like

770
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,839
lilacs or that smells like uh

771
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,840
honeysuckles

772
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:33,279
or that smells like dog poop just go

773
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:34,639
smell some stuff and then you have other

774
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:36,079
things to compare that to

775
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,840
and sorry i sniffled into the microphone

776
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:38,319
when i tried to do that scent thing for

777
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:40,158
you

778
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:42,319
i got that deviated septum and it's

779
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:44,559
rocking today anyway

780
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:45,759
get us back on track here the one thing

781
00:22:44,558 --> 00:22:48,558
that's going to throw you off

782
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:50,000
is a mislabeled product that's one thing

783
00:22:48,558 --> 00:22:51,359
that will definitely screw you all up if

784
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,839
you're testing a product that you think

785
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:54,399
is

786
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:55,759
orange kush and it's [ __ ] orange haze

787
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,440
and you mark it down in your mental

788
00:22:55,759 --> 00:22:58,720
notes as orange cushy just [ __ ] up all

789
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,159
the results but

790
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,000
i think you're gonna be okay you're

791
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:03,760
smart enough you're human you can adjust

792
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,720
your notes and details and data entry

793
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:06,798
that way

794
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,000
uh i just wish that people wouldn't do

795
00:23:06,798 --> 00:23:10,480
things like that to mess you

796
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,119
up then there are going to be things

797
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,679
like

798
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:15,839
if i grow if i had og kush and you had

799
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,320
og kush and five of our friends had og

800
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:18,158
kush

801
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:19,359
there will be variables in that grow

802
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:20,960
it's gonna taste smell

803
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:22,879
burn and affect you a little bit

804
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:25,360
differently based on my environment

805
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,880
that's a phenotypical expression if my

806
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:28,399
room's a little bit more humid

807
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,840
maybe i'll get stickier buds if your

808
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,880
room's a little dryer maybe you'll get

809
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:32,480
fluffier buds

810
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,240
if my room's warmer maybe i'll get

811
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,679
airier buds if your room is cooler maybe

812
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,319
you'll get more dense buds

813
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,200
all of these things will have a role on

814
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:41,759
the flavor

815
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,200
and effect of that finished product also

816
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:45,440
drying and curing

817
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,519
will have a huge difference and effect

818
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,960
and roll on the outcome of that product

819
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:50,240
if it's not dried and cured and

820
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,400
processed properly

821
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,278
well the same plant you can cut buds off

822
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,038
of one plant

823
00:23:53,278 --> 00:23:56,480
and buds off the same plant dried one

824
00:23:55,038 --> 00:23:58,400
one way and one the other way they could

825
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,640
taste completely differently

826
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,400
so things like that you'll learn how to

827
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,919
taste a proper drying cure

828
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,759
while you're learning to identify

829
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:07,120
different strains so that'll be fun for

830
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:08,558
you

831
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:10,639
i'm looking at my notes to make sure

832
00:24:08,558 --> 00:24:11,200
i've covered everything the bottom line

833
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,840
