53
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:21,280
the number one response and request that

54
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:22,399
i did get from that feedback was longer

55
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,800
podcasts

56
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,560
i would love to give you longer podcasts

57
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,640
but just being me sitting here rambling

58
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,120
at a camera with a few notes in front of

59
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:33,919
me it feels really weird going for

60
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,680
longer than 25 35 minutes it's hard to

61
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:37,598
talk to yourself for that long without

62
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,280
somebody at least nodding at you and

63
00:02:37,598 --> 00:02:41,679
replying i've got this camera looking at

64
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,519
me but it gets weird after about 30

65
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,879
minutes or so i feel like i'm just

66
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,560
talking at the wall because i'm just

67
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:49,759
talking to a camera lens it doesn't give

68
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,360
me any feedback which is hard to do so

69
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:53,039
i've gotten good at it the instagram

70
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,959
lives definitely help on the instagram i

71
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:56,639
do get the comments and some feedback in

72
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,158
there but that does help me get going

73
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:00,958
here there's i'm just talking at the

74
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:03,598
wall so it's hard to uh carry on a 30

75
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,598
minute conversation by myself then also

76
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:07,679
my voice will burn up there's nobody i

77
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:10,479
don't get a time to like let my throat

78
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,840
cool down my voice uh cool my voice and

79
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:13,840
i guess are the things that it doesn't

80
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,598
get any rest while the other person

81
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,120
talks because it's just me talking so

82
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:19,839
it's hard to do more than 30 minutes or

83
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,280
so the voice burns out then also the add

84
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,959
burns out i start thinking about like

85
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,158
well now i have to edit this long ass

86
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,920
show i got to get the show up to the

87
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:27,759
internet also another thing that you

88
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:28,639
guys probably don't care about is when i

89
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:30,560
do the

90
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:33,039
multi-cam shows and they get real long

91
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,560
they take a long time to edit so that

92
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:37,039
stuff does come to mind when i'm making

93
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,039
longer shows but mainly it's because uh

94
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:41,359
i just can't talk for 30 minutes by

95
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:43,359
myself the other request was that i do

96
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,280
bring mike on more frequently people do

97
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,519
seem to enjoy having mike on the podcast

98
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,280
which does of course result in longer

99
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,680
shows because mike can talk quite a bit

100
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,840
as well so in the future you will see

101
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,400
some shows with mike the uh the general

102
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,239
uh survey says that they do want mike on

103
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,519
about a third of the shows maybe a

104
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,599
quarter maybe a fifth of the show

105
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,039
somewhere in that area but not every

106
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:05,199
show but they do want to hear from mike

107
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:07,759
so we'll get mike on uh mike this is an

108
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:09,679
official invitation get a babysitter

109
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:11,438
come be on the show let's talk about

110
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,640
some cool [ __ ] all right i feel like i'm

111
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:14,158
rambling

112
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:15,759
my main point of that start of the show

113
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:17,439
there was thank you you guys for the

114
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:19,358
great uh constructive criticism the

115
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:21,600
positive feedback steering me in the

116
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:23,839
right direction i do appreciate that uh

117
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,280
sometimes we all do need a little bit of

118
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:27,119
encouragement and if i don't ask you

119
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:29,119
what i'm doing right and wrong you might

120
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,800
not tell me so i'll never figure it out

121
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,560
all right the next order of business on

122
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,400
the list of things to cover is something

123
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,639
i'm very excited about i may have teased

124
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:40,000
or hinted about this previously

125
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:43,360
but ire direct is live that's right if

126

rasta jeff thanks for addressing my

210
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:44,799
question on the show much appreciated i

211
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,120

212
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,759
the foreseeable future but then it says

213
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,240
i appreciate you bro in a completely

214
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,919
unrelated note was it you that i heard

215
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,400
about frying a peanut butter and jelly

216
00:07:53,918 --> 00:07:58,560
sandwich like a grilled cheese i had one

217
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:00,000
last night and it was unreal i'm pretty

218
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,478
sure i heard about it from you a while

219
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,560
back but i wasn't sure if that tip was

220
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:07,918
you then big ups once again bro that

221
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:10,959

222
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:12,399
in the 7-11 episode episode number 711

223
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:13,839

7-eleven and the munchies um i did an

226
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,960
episode talking about snacks and

227
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,800
munchies and i did mention a fried or

228
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:24,079
maybe a grilled peanut butter and jelly

229
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,160
sandwich you make yourself a normal

230
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:27,758
peanut butter and jelly sandwich slap

231
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,120
butter on the outsides of both pieces of

232
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,038
the bread and throw that [ __ ] in a hot

233
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,038
pan grill it like you would a grilled

234
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:35,838
cheese sandwich and that peanut butter

235
00:08:33,038 --> 00:08:37,838

238

friends here for following the guidance

239
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,480
following the advice

240
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:49,120
experiencing life and enjoying the

241
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,800
grilled or the fried peanut butter and

242
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,879
jelly sandwich i'm glad you found out

243
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:55,838
about that thanks for reporting back

244
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:57,679
enjoy okay let's focus in a little bit i

245
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,600
did say that i had some grow questions

246
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:02,239
here i've got a grow question that came

247
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,920
from the website from the grow help tab

248
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,519
this one came from our friend oh it says

249
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:07,599
keep me and not a mouse this one came

250
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,759
from our friend anonymous and it goes a

251
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,839
lot like this it says rasta jeff when

252
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:14,240
you switch to 18 6 at the end of the

253
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:16,640
flowering cycle do you reduce the

254
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:19,519
intensity of the lights or just let them

255
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:22,000
rip i'm thinking about their dli needs

256
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,120
if you if you do reduce the power okay i

257
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,720
don't so we don't even need to talk

258
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,639
about that um

259
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,360
so let's kind of recap what our friend

260
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:32,639
is talking about i have been preaching a

261
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:35,759
method a technique of i switch my lights

262
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:38,000
back to 18 hours on and six hours off at

263
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:40,319
the end of a flowering cycle many people

264
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,399
think that that is absolutely crazy they

265
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,240
think i'm [ __ ] everything up by doing

266
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,559
this but it has proven to be very

267
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,399
successful for me i learned this by

268
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:50,719
doing it to my seated crop i learned

269
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:53,200
that my seeds become more healthy

270
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,040
they harden up faster they're bigger

271
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,640
stronger faster more vigorous i get a

272
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:58,799
better germination rate i get more

273
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:01,439
successful seeds from a crop by

274
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:03,919
switching my flowering lights to 18

275
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,680
hours on and six hours off toward the

276
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:07,919
end of flower when i'm doing this with

277
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:09,838
the flowering crop that is not seeded i

278
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:12,559
generally do this when i begin to flush

279
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,959
the final 10 to 14 days or so is when i

280
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:17,518
will do the 18 hours on and six hours

281
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:18,399
off one note that i have been stressing

282
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,720
that people

283
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,320
make sure to follow this word of advice

284
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,320
please listen to this one if you're

285
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,760
going to do the 18 6

286
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:31,278
do not do it on the first run with a

287
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:33,120
plant learn the plant see how long that

288
00:10:31,278 --> 00:10:35,600
plant takes to finish

289
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:38,560
then you know when to change the timer

290
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,720
to 18 6 next time so let the plants

291
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:43,119
finish the first run don't do this on a

292
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,959
brand new plant this is not a first date

293
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,440
trick this is a trick for a plant that

294
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:50,000
you've got some experience with

295
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:52,959
so at the end of flower during the flush

296
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,879
phase i will turn my lights back on from

297
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:59,359
12 12 to 18 hours on and six hours off

298
00:10:56,879 --> 00:11:01,278
now i'm giving them half a day more

299
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,000
worth of light worth of more more worth

300
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:08,159
of photons more energy for growth

301
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,759
more uh more robust fat dense buds is

302
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:12,480
basically what you're going to get or in

303
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:14,639
my case bigger fatter healthier seeds so

304
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:17,680
i do just straight turn the light timer

305
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:19,360
on to 18 6 and i do not change the

306
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:21,439
intensity of the lighting at all i don't

307
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,759
want to reduce the intensity i want to

308
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,519
give them more light longer days let

309
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:27,838
them grow now people are going to say

310
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:30,000
your plants are going to re-veg it takes

311
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:31,760
much longer for the plants to re-veg

312
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,559
than it does for them to beef up and

313
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:36,399
swell in time for the harvest that's why

314
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:38,319
i talk about don't do this on your first

315
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:40,240
run if you do this on the second and

316
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,480
third run we know when the harvest will

317
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,560
be you kick it right in time you cut

318
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,959
down before anybody revenges you don't

319
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:49,599
cause any problems so the short answer

320
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:52,399
is no i do not reduce the amount of

321
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,800
light when i switch to 18-6 i keep them

322
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:58,000
banging i keep them going and i do it

323
00:11:54,799 --> 00:12:00,000
business as usual until the plants are

324
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,679
done very good question thank you for

325
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,919

339
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:29,119
smart person you got some great ideas

340
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,040
but you should go outside and get away

341
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,919
from the computer for just a couple of

342
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:33,679
minutes

343
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:36,240
nothing but love bro this question goes

344
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:38,799
on it says what's up ross to jeff what

345
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:41,600
is your personal order of importance in

346
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:44,240
your grow operation would this change at

347
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,000
home versus commercially then he kind of

348
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,159
touches it up it says is there an order

349
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,039
in which you enter and exit your grow

350
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:54,240
areas to prevent bringing issues from

351
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:56,639
one area to another like in order of

352
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,799
work flow then it follows up with does

353
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:01,200
your mother room have a special entrance

354
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:03,039
or exit or plan are there any special

355
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,240
procedures then there's some more stuff

356
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:06,639
that we don't really need to cover a lot

357
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:09,039
right now we can jump right into this

358
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:11,440
this is a good question the first part

359
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:13,278
of the question um is there an order of

360
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,040
importance in your grow then it says

361
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:16,639
would it change at home versus

362
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:19,759
commercially i can answer that very

363
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:22,079
easily yes and a personal grow versus a

364
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:24,000
commercial grow the order of operations

365
00:13:22,078 --> 00:13:26,559
the importance of operations change

366
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,159
drastically in a commercial environment

367
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:29,919
uh we've got a lot of people going in

368
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:32,078
and out there's at least three to five

369
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:33,759
maybe 10 maybe 20 people going in and

370
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:34,559
out of any commercial environment at any

371
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:36,399
time

372
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:37,199
that are regular employees you've got

373
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,278
your

374
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,759
lead cultivator then you've got your

375
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:43,519
growtex and then you've got your

376
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:45,360
your helpers and then you got your trim

377
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:48,320
crew your lead trimmer your harvest

378
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,440
manager um your compliance manager

379
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,519
there's a bunch of people running

380
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,680
through there then also sometimes

381
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,198
ownership shows up like the owners

382
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:56,719
aren't employees they're not there every

383
00:13:55,198 --> 00:13:59,039
day they don't give a [ __ ] about

384
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,720
standard operating procedures sometimes

385
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:02,319
you could tell the owner we do it this

386
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,519
way and they go that's fine i'm gonna go

387
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,440
in there and you're like but we all put

388
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,198
on tyvek suits and [ __ ] tie up our

389
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,639
hair and the owner goes i'm gonna wear

390
00:14:07,198 --> 00:14:09,919
my dress and my high heels in there and

391
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,839
i don't give a [ __ ] what you think and

392
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:13,360
you go you own it you get to do what you

393
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:15,519
got to do so we get a lot of people

394
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:18,000
coming and going through the grow

395
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:20,639
sometimes you have contractors in there

396
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,078
i assume just because that's why my

397
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,079
brain works i assume that those

398
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:25,599
contractors came from another grow

399
00:14:24,078 --> 00:14:27,039
before they worked in my grow that's

400
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,720
just what my brain thinks i think

401
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:30,719
everybody that shows up in a commercial

402
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,320
facility just came from another

403
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,079
commercial facility that's all that they

404
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,440
do that's all we think about that's just

405
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:37,120
that's not real but that's what my brain

406
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,279
thinks so we got a lot of people coming

407
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,240
and going is my point here some people i

408
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:41,919
can

409
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,399
kind of and i don't want to say control

410
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:45,838
but i can control the coming and going

411
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,198
of some people i can control the

412
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:49,440
procedures of some people the

413
00:14:47,198 --> 00:14:52,159
cleanliness uh the approach to some

414
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,240
people other people i cannot ownership i

415
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:55,919
can't i am a paid consultant i can

416
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,000
recommend things to the owner but i

417
00:14:55,919 --> 00:15:00,078
cannot tell the owner what to do i can

418
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,879
fire employees i can hire employees the

419
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:04,559
owner can fire me so i can recommend

420
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:06,000
that you don't wear the high heels and

421
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:07,518
the skirt into the grow room that you

422
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,120
put on the tyvek suit like the rest of

423
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:12,000
us but if she wants to look hot that's

424
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:14,159
what she is gonna [ __ ] do today so

425
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,799
the order of importance definitely does

426
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:18,480
change in a personal grow compared to a

427
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:20,000
commercial grow environment like i said

428
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,278
we've got so many people coming in a

429
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,759
commercial grow

430
00:15:21,278 --> 00:15:25,519
also there's so much more at stake in a

431
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:26,399
commercial grow if my personal growth

432
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,399
fails

433
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,000
i will survive i won't make a crop of

434
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:31,519
seeds or i won't make a batch of flowers

435
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,958
and mike won't get to smoke and we won't

436
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,959
have as good of a time

437
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:37,278
but life will go on [ __ ] will continue

438
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:38,799
if we ruin a crop at a commercial grow

439
00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:40,480
because we let somebody bring in some

440
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:42,799
bugs or i brought in some bugs if there

441
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:46,240
was a mistake there are millions of

442
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:48,639
dollars at risk there um one crop

443
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:51,198
one major crop failure in the commercial

444
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:52,639
market right now could destroy a

445
00:15:51,198 --> 00:15:55,039
commercial grow

446
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,879
if that commercial grower to fail it

447
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:59,759
could also destroy

448
00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:01,360
their medically infused product uh

449
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,879
facility which would be

450
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,800
so the grow is where the flowers are

451
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:06,320
grown obviously right they don't the

452
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:08,319
flowers aren't sold from there they are

453
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,160
then taken either directly to the

454
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,320
dispensary for sale which is my next

455
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:14,639
avenue or they are taken to a medically

456
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,240
infused products laboratory where they

457
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,959
are turned into a concentrate turned

458
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:21,120
into edibles turned into a lotion turned

459
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:23,359
into a lube a lubricant they do all

460
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,600
kinds of [ __ ] with it but that medically

461
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:28,159
infused products facility

462
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,159
would also go under if the growth sinks

463
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:33,120
so do all of these subsequent facilities

464
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:35,039
which is the medically infused processor

465
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:38,000
and the dispensary attached to it so the

466
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:40,480
one crop could ruin three businesses

467
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,120
that all fall under one business entity

468
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,879
which would mean you got probably 15 20

469
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,278
people at the dispensary or at the grow

470
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:48,559
working uh probably maybe five or ten

471
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:50,559
people depending on your medically

472
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:52,559
infused uh whatever you got going on you

473
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:54,239
got 520 people there then at the

474
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:56,000
dispensary you got probably 20 people

475
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,560
working there there's going to be

476
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,399
somewhere between 20 and 100 people that

477
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:03,039
are fired and are out of work because of

478
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:05,199
one crop failure so things are much more

479
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:07,519
critical things are much tighter in a

480
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:09,199
commercial environment also something

481
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:10,879
that um

482
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,959
it matters it does make a difference we

483
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:15,439
cannot use the same methods of

484
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:18,880
eradication in a commercial environment

485
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:20,880
i do my best to stick to colorado

486
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,400
department of agriculture and colorado

487
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:25,520
marijuana enforcement division

488
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:27,679
regulations when it comes to pesticides

489
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:30,160
and fungicides and cleanliness and

490
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:33,600
things like that within my personal grow

491
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:35,360
but honestly when people um if i were to

492
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:36,798
get a clone from a friend i'm trying to

493
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:38,399
think i had to say that safely if i get

494
00:17:36,798 --> 00:17:40,558
a clone from somebody no matter where it

495
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,640
came from i will treat it with a

496
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:44,480
pesticide that is not allowed in a

497
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:47,038
commercial grow because

498
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,960
uh that is my my way of protecting

499
00:17:47,038 --> 00:17:50,319
myself i can treat those incoming plants

500
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,840
with a really

501
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:53,599
a strong pesticide that i wouldn't

502
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:54,959
recommend unless it's an incoming plant

503
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:56,240
that's the only reason i have this

504
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,240
pesticide is

505
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,440
people say i don't have bugs and people

506
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,120
like to say that they don't have

507
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,279
diseases but guess what not everybody

508
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:04,959
knows that they got a disease or a bug

509
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:06,879
so when i get a plant i treat it with

510
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,038
some crazy [ __ ] i've learned my lesson i

511
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,559
got spider mites from somebody uh no

512
00:18:09,038 --> 00:18:13,119
names to be said here but somebody sent

513
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:15,519
me a clone that had the most ferocious

514
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:18,399
[ __ ] spider mites i've ever seen it

515
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:19,839
slowed me down honestly for a full year

516
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,320
these spider mites

517
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:24,720
they would not go away i needed a solid

518
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:26,879
colorado winter i was sucking in cold

519
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,640
air from the negative 17 outside blowing

520
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,240
it into the veg room the plants look

521
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,320
like [ __ ] but eventually the spider

522
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,359
mites died i kept treating for them

523
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:35,038
anyway

524
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:37,599
i don't want to get that problem again

525
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:40,400
so i treat very heavily when plants come

526
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:42,159
in to prevent problems you couldn't do

527
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,919
what i do in a commercial grow because

528
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:47,038
the products that i'm applying are

529
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:48,880
actually banned i know that that's i say

530
00:18:47,038 --> 00:18:50,240
that i try to grow from my heart breed

531
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,400
with love and treat these plants with a

532
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,480
lot of love but that is my preventative

533
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,960
measure to keep my livelihood my

534
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,558
business afloat if i let spider mites

535
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,400
get in here again and ruin a bunch of

536
00:18:58,558 --> 00:19:01,918
plants then that's that's a bunch of

537
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,360
seeds you guys don't get to grow that's

538
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:05,360
a bunch of herb that mike and i don't

539
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:08,000
get to smoke so i've got to prevent that

540
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:09,599
sort of stuff now let's get back to um

541
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,440
the commercial girls can't use that

542
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:13,759
stuff i can use that stuff so that's one

543
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,440
of the main differences is the amount of

544
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:18,000
people that come and go and the products

545
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,679
which we are allowed to use also i was

546
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,160
talking about the funding in the budget

547
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:24,240
if my crop goes away that's a couple of

548
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,880
lights at six plants not a big deal bye

549
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:29,599
bye in a commercial grow we've got

550
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:32,080
hundreds maybe thousands of plants in

551
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:34,480
one area and if you get a problem over

552
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:36,639
here in this tray

553
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,319
there are fans there are people walking

554
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,480
around the [ __ ] is gonna move around

555
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:42,960
very quickly if one room gets

556
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:45,279
contaminated if one table gets an

557
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:47,120
infestation of bugs it's gonna move

558
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:48,960
around with the fans the spider mites

559
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:50,239
climb up to the tops of the plants and

560
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,840
they feel the wind and they go oh

561
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,359
there's a breeze and they put out a

562
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:55,359
little web and they jump and they have a

563
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:57,199
leap of faith and they draw that that

564
00:19:55,359 --> 00:19:58,639
web with them and wherever they land

565
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,240
that's where they build the new web too

566
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,840
and they just make that leap of faith

567
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,159
and they use the fan to blow themselves

568
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:06,079
around and travel also they use the

569
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:07,600
growtex and the growers to travel around

570
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:09,279
they're jumping on your if you're

571
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:10,639
wearing scrubs they jump on your scrubs

572
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:12,960
if you're wearing a t-shirt they jump on

573
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,799
your t-shirt they move around the grow

574
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,840
with that stuff so we're spreading them

575
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:20,558
around the grow if we get one small area

576
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:22,558
infected infested with bugs it moves

577
00:20:20,558 --> 00:20:24,240
very very quickly so my order of

578
00:20:22,558 --> 00:20:26,798
operations is

579
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:29,120
not just different but it's more very

580
00:20:26,798 --> 00:20:30,798
more strict and very more astringent in

581
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:33,519
a commercial environment one thing i

582
00:20:30,798 --> 00:20:36,079
should loop back around in my personal

583
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:38,079
grow it's personal nobody goes there

584
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:40,000
you're not invited get the [ __ ] out you

585

589
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,919

ask can i see a couple of your plants i

593
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:56,959

space is my little zen area that is my

603
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:19,280
space i don't take people in there you

of leave me alone you can't change the

608
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:30,880
music in there you can't turn down the

609
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,038
fan

610
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,480
don't touch it you're not invited i know

611
00:21:33,038 --> 00:21:35,839
it sounds rude right

612
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,759
it's cool you're allowed to do that with

613
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:39,918
your space it's mine it's yours you do

614
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:41,599
what you want i'm gonna do what i want i

615
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:43,679
love it so that is my grow space nobody

616
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:45,439
gets to go in there but me i definitely

617
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,880
don't have any pets down there no dogs

618
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,960
get to go up there

619
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:51,520
that is just my grow space so what i've

620
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:54,079
got to do for preventative is much less

621
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:56,079
when i get uh when i get home if i'm

622
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:57,678
going to the grow space i simply drop

623
00:21:56,079 --> 00:22:00,240
the clothes that i'm wearing and from

624
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:01,759
the shoes the socks the pants i leave

625
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,400
the same undies if you want to visualize

626
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:06,240
that ah the shirt's got to go the dreads

627
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,360
are usually tied up or untied somehow if

628
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,519
i'm going into the grill i've got a

629
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:12,558
specific hat tie the locks up put them

630
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:14,158
into the specific hat i wear a couple of

631
00:22:12,558 --> 00:22:15,759
outfits that i rotate into the grow i

632
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:18,080
wash them quite frequently but i've got

633
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:20,640
specific grow room clothes that i wear

634
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:22,319
in there so i come from wherever i was

635
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,799
basically strip down put on the grow

636
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:26,720
room clothes go into the grow as i come

637
00:22:24,798 --> 00:22:28,798
out before those go any of those i go

638
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,159
into any other room those grow clothes

639
00:22:28,798 --> 00:22:31,519
come off and they get stacked into a

640
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:32,960
little bit of a pile sometimes they get

641
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:34,798
thrown in the washer if i saw any

642
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,798
problems a lot of times i'll take a

643
00:22:34,798 --> 00:22:38,720
shower before i even go into that grow

644
00:22:36,798 --> 00:22:40,720
space of course i got [ __ ] six foot

645
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,640
long dreadlocks so it's kind of hard to

646
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:45,200
completely shower before i go into every

647
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,559
grow space but i do my best another

648
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:49,440
thing that helps me out is i'm allowed

649
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:51,519
to use different products so my main

650
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,519
standard operating procedures are very

651
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:55,440
different in my personal grow and in

652
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:57,359
commercial grows because the amount of

653
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,840
people that are coming and going

654
00:22:57,359 --> 00:23:01,519
the amount of risk that is involved the

655
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:03,359
options that we've got for mitigating

656
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:06,079
problems if i see a problem in migraine

657
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:08,959
i can blast it with whatever i want that

658
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:10,960
i feel ethical doing so and also keep in

659
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,480
mind people aren't going to smoke 90 of

660
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:15,038
what i grow most of what i grow is

661
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,159
seeded so technically i could i don't

662
00:23:15,038 --> 00:23:17,279
don't give you don't think i'm doing

663
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:19,280
this but i could spray it with

664
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:20,960
everything because you're not going to

665
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:22,639
smoke it that's the reason we worry

666
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,400
about spraying our plants mostly is

667
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,080
because we don't want people smoking

668
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,919
contaminated [ __ ] you're not going to

669
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:28,798
smoke it bro it's all going to be seeds

670
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:30,400
which

671
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:32,158
i'm just hypothetically saying i could

672
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,559
treat it with all kinds of [ __ ] we can't

673
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:37,039
do that in a commercial grow so order of

674
00:23:34,558 --> 00:23:39,119
importance um

675
00:23:37,038 --> 00:23:41,278
it's similar order of importance keep

676
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:43,119
the plants healthy keep them bug free

677
00:23:41,278 --> 00:23:45,519
have an integrated pest management

678
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:48,158
strategy and then grow from your heart

679
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:49,519
breed with love the order of importance

680
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:51,919
is the same

681
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:53,679
but the uh the way the operation the

682
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:55,200
procedures change a little bit because

683
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:57,120
like i said we've got so many people

684
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,480
coming and going at the commercial grows

685
00:23:57,119 --> 00:24:00,479
that we've got to do a little bit of

686
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,400
stuff differently then it says is there

687
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,798
an order in which you enter and exit

688
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,159
your grow areas that's a very good

689
00:24:04,798 --> 00:24:07,839
question

690
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:09,120
uh one thing that i do in a commercial

691
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:10,000
environment

692
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:11,759
um

693
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,440
if i am the boss which most of the time

694
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:15,919
not to sound egotistical i'm the boss

695
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:18,240
i'm the guy directing the grow team i

696
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:20,559
like to learn what each grower is good

697
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,240
at and what each grower is not good at

698
00:24:20,558 --> 00:24:25,759
let's just hypothetically talk about my

699
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:27,120
friends elijah and brian elijah is five

700
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:29,919
foot something

701
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:31,519
brian is six foot something why would i

702
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,120
have brian do the [ __ ] on the bottom and

703
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:34,960
elijah do the [ __ ] on the top i've

704
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:38,000
learned that brian can do the tall stuff

705
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:40,159
elijah can do the lower stuff so it's my

706
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,679
job as the kind of the boss the director

707
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:43,760
of cultivation the guy in charge of the

708
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:45,360
crew i find who is good at what that's

709
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:47,278
one of the things i really like to do i

710
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:48,959
know that cletus likes to be outside a

711
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:50,798
lot so if there's a job that goes

712
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,919
outside galitus gets that job

713
00:24:50,798 --> 00:24:53,839
immediately i know that some of the

714
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:55,120
growers they want to be inside all the

715
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:56,639
time so if there's a job that goes

716
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:58,639
outside don't make him do it it'll get

717
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,640
done half ass that's something that i

718
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,640
try to learn now something that i keep

719
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:05,120
in mind when i'm assigning tasks for the

720
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:07,600
start of the day is i put a person in a

721
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:09,439
room and i try to leave i we we're doing

722
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:12,240
elijah and brian and cletus if i've got

723
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:14,480
rooms a b and c i will try to put brian

724
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:16,000
in room a all day so that he doesn't

725
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,599
have to come out of room a and [ __ ] up

726
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,839
room b he doesn't bring the problems

727
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:21,839
from room a to room b that is something

728
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:23,839
that i would do elijah would get room c

729
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:25,678
cletus would get room however i did it

730
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:26,959
we'd give the guys an individual room or

731
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:28,798
the ladies too we've got plenty of

732
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,079
ladies in the grow i just say guys all

733
00:25:28,798 --> 00:25:32,639
the time because it's just what i

734
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:35,199
[ __ ] say dude um so let the guys and

735
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:37,038
gals uh have individual rooms or i'll

736
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,720
put three or four guys or gals in one

737
00:25:37,038 --> 00:25:40,240
room and just make them stick in that

738
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,519
room so they're not moving the problems

739
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,519
around that's one way that i really

740
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:47,119
focus on it then you asked about an

741
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:49,359
order of workflow in my personal grow i

742
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:51,519
tend to check on the clones

743
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:53,359
first and most often because they're

744
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:55,599
kind of they're critical they are in

745
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:57,678
triage they're in icu the clones are not

746
00:25:55,599 --> 00:25:59,199
alive they need a lot of attention if

747
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:00,960
that dome gets bumped a little bit and

748
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,880
the humidity comes out we're [ __ ] all

749
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:05,600
your clones are going to die so i check

750
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:07,440
those as often as possible kind of ocd

751
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:10,240
as frequently as i can

752
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:12,080
then the smaller plants are probably

753
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,319
going to dry up the soonest so i check

754
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:16,079
those next then

755
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:18,000
i'm in the veg areas and i will check

756
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:20,000
the bigger veg plants i'll check those

757
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,278
next then of course the mother plants

758
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
are in there i would check the mother

759
00:26:21,278 --> 00:26:26,720
plants next i got the clones the veg the

760
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,159
moms all in one area so i make sure that

761
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,839
those are cool

762
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:31,600
then we would check the flowering space

763
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:33,759
after that but i basically start from

764
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:36,158
the the starters all the way up to the

765
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:38,960
enders because my thought process is i

766
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:41,440
need healthy starts if they're already

767
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,600
uh infested infected contaminated at the

768
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,278
end they're almost done i can't save

769
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:47,599
them i just gotta get them i gotta ride

770
00:26:45,278 --> 00:26:50,079
them out but i need healthy [ __ ] for my

771
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:51,918
next run always i need healthy moms

772
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:54,399
healthy clones healthy veg or i cannot

773
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:56,799
have a strong flower so i focus mostly

774
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,798
my order of operations honestly

775
00:26:56,798 --> 00:27:00,960
in the commercial grow and the home grow

776
00:26:58,798 --> 00:27:01,918
i focus on the littles and i work my way

777
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,919
up

778
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:05,520
all the way to the end of the day is

779
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:07,600
we're checking on burping the jars and

780
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:09,759
harvesting and that's a whole other

781
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:11,359
[ __ ] conversation then it says does

782
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:13,919
your mother room have a specialty

783
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:15,759
entrance or exit plan um without

784
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:17,360
revealing too much info

785
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:19,200
the home grove is a home grow it's got a

786
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:21,199
bedroom door on it bro

787
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,519
it's got a lock and a key and a bedroom

788
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,200
[ __ ] door no special grow the windows

789
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:27,038
are covered so nothing can get in and

790
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,120
out i put uh

791
00:27:27,038 --> 00:27:31,278
the it's two great words together one of

792
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:33,439
my favorite products i use gorilla [ __ ]

793
00:27:31,278 --> 00:27:35,359
to seal all the cracks and then put tape

794
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,120
over that as well so nothing's getting

795
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:39,599
in and out of there unless it goes under

796
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:41,759
the door or through the air ducts which

797
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:44,240
i have created i use the air underneath

798
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:45,759
the door for passive air intake let me

799
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,440
read more of this question because i got

800
00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:48,720
rambling really well i'm not even sure

801
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,558
that i've answered the question but i've

802
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,798
talked a lot so you guys asked for

803
00:27:50,558 --> 00:27:54,319
longer shows you [ __ ] get it today uh

804
00:27:52,798 --> 00:27:56,960
personal order of importance in your

805
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:57,839
grow i go personal order of importance

806
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,640
um

807
00:27:57,839 --> 00:28:02,079
i don't know if i did my flow chart but

808
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,600
order of importance is like clean

809
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:05,519
healthy plants

810
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:06,719
does all the gear work one of the first

811
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:07,918
things i do when i walk into a

812
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,399
commercial growth i make sure that

813
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:12,399
everything is working um

814
00:28:10,398 --> 00:28:14,558
we haven't been there for 12 hours did

815
00:28:12,398 --> 00:28:16,000
anything break i teach the new people i

816
00:28:14,558 --> 00:28:17,678
always say all right now we got to go

817
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,960
find out what went wrong last night and

818
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:21,278
they're like what i'm like oh something

819
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:23,519
broke last night a timer died a pump

820
00:28:21,278 --> 00:28:25,359
failed something [ __ ] shorted out

821
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:27,278
something somewhere broke last night we

822
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:28,719
got to go find that so order of

823
00:28:27,278 --> 00:28:32,240
importance check the gear check the

824
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:34,399
plants uh smallest to largest then do i

825
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:36,319
scout a lot um when i come back from

826
00:28:34,398 --> 00:28:38,000
lunch probably because i'm blazed i just

827
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:40,079
[ __ ] took fat dabs at lunch i like to

828
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,398
just cruise and look for bugs just go

829
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:44,558
cruise a room send the guys in the rooms

830
00:28:42,398 --> 00:28:46,558
just go guys and girls just go scout for

831
00:28:44,558 --> 00:28:48,480
bugs right after lunch go see if you see

832
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:50,639
anything and if you do report back if

833
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,720
not get back to work business as usual

834
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,640
so order of importance i talked about

835
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:57,278
doing the small plants up to the biggest

836
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:59,919
plants doesn't really change at home in

837
00:28:57,278 --> 00:29:00,798
order which i enter or exit the groves

838
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:02,720
um

839
00:29:00,798 --> 00:29:05,359
since i my homegrow is basically two

840
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:06,880
small rooms so not there's no

841
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:09,278
if there's something in that space it

842
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:11,840
got in both spaces probably but i do the

843
00:29:09,278 --> 00:29:13,278
veg stuff then i do the flower stuff

844
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:14,959
then you ask about how i prevent from

845
00:29:13,278 --> 00:29:16,720
moving problems around basically in a

846
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:19,278
commercial grow the way that i do that

847
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:21,120
is i try to keep people in specific

848
00:29:19,278 --> 00:29:23,038
rooms when we go to lunch when we go to

849
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:25,119
break i try to remind the guys to take

850
00:29:23,038 --> 00:29:26,398
off their they're wearing a jacket or a

851
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:28,319
hoodie or something i try to have a

852
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:30,479
special shirt special shoes and stuff

853
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:32,480
for each grow sometimes it's hard to

854
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,480
implement certain sops that some grows

855
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,960
when i'm not fully

856
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:38,720
100 in charge they will take my advice

857
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:41,759
and my guidance but they won't always

858
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:43,600
take everything as instruction does my

859
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:44,558
mother room have a special entrance and

860
00:29:43,599 --> 00:29:46,558
exit

861
00:29:44,558 --> 00:29:48,240
and the commercial grows we like to get

862
00:29:46,558 --> 00:29:50,558
those things you can step on the floor

863
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:52,079
mats it's got pesticides inside of it

864
00:29:50,558 --> 00:29:54,398
you stomp around on it it will kill all

865
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:57,119
the [ __ ] on your shoes in some places we

866
00:29:54,398 --> 00:29:58,879
use booties uh just little shoe covers a

867
00:29:57,119 --> 00:30:02,000
lot of places we do use a hair net and a

868
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:03,840
beard net a lot of places we do scrubs a

869
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,359
lot of places honestly bro we walk in

870
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:06,959
and out of everything in our regular

871
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:09,278
[ __ ] clothes it just depends on which

872
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,960
facility and what the owner agrees with

873
00:30:09,278 --> 00:30:13,839
i make suggestions

874
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:15,679
the owner kind of makes the final move

875
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:17,918
it does go on it says i have a shared

876
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:20,720
mom and veg room what can i do to help

877
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:22,640
keep my mom plants safe that is very

878
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,558
good question uh we've been talking

879
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,679
about viruses lately

880
00:30:24,558 --> 00:30:27,678
between

881
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:30,080
if you go from your veg plants to your

882
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:32,159
mother plants uh consider dunking your

883
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:34,158
scissors in bleach and cleaning those

884
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:36,159
scissors before you go cutting on your

885
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:37,520
mother plants that way if you do and if

886
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:38,799
you've got the viroid it's probably in

887
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:40,639
the mother plant but if you don't want

888
00:30:38,798 --> 00:30:43,440
to move it around perhaps maybe it would

889
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:45,278
help you cleanliness is the key um

890
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:48,159
that's what i would recommend and i have

891
00:30:45,278 --> 00:30:49,599
a shared mom clone veg space as well i

892
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:51,440
think you'll be just fine with that

893
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:53,678
setup then it says i like starting in

894
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:55,519
the veg mom room closing everything up

895
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:58,960
and moving on to the flower room have

896
00:30:55,519 --> 00:31:01,200
you ever worked backwards i've done it

897
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:03,360
backwards i've done it forward as long

898
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:05,360
as you're clean and paying attention and

899
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:07,359
not moving problems around that's what

900
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:08,959
matters as long as you've got a strategy

901
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:10,639
a standard operating procedure that

902
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:12,720
works for you that's the most important

903
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:14,399
part one of my favorite things of

904
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:17,679
growing cannabis

905
00:31:14,398 --> 00:31:19,759
is that my way works and it could be

906
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:21,759
totally different than your way and your

907
00:31:19,759 --> 00:31:23,038
way is not wrong as long as at the end

908
00:31:21,759 --> 00:31:26,558
of it we're both sitting here at the

909
00:31:23,038 --> 00:31:28,398
table smoking a bowl and we go

910
00:31:26,558 --> 00:31:30,398
i'm satisfied that's what [ __ ]

911
00:31:28,398 --> 00:31:32,479
matters as long as you're satisfied with

912
00:31:30,398 --> 00:31:34,879
the weed you grew i'm satisfied with the

913
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,399
weed that i grew we didn't do it wrong

914
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,159
the only way you really do it wrong is

915
00:31:36,398 --> 00:31:40,239
if the plant died then you obviously did

916
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:42,320
it wrong if you burned some [ __ ] down

917
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:44,640
you did it wrong if you get somebody

918
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:46,720
sick by using a pesticide improperly you

919
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,080
did it wrong um

920
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,440
i'd like to say if you go to jail you

921
00:31:48,079 --> 00:31:50,798
did it wrong but that might not even

922
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:53,519
been part of the case that might have

923
00:31:50,798 --> 00:31:55,119
just been some [ __ ] there for you but

924
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:56,880
if you're smoking weed and you're happy

925
00:31:55,119 --> 00:31:58,798
with the way that it came out you're not

926
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,559
doing it wrong there may be things i do

927
00:31:58,798 --> 00:32:02,158
differently there may be things i

928
00:32:00,558 --> 00:32:04,240
wouldn't do or maybe things that i would

929
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:05,919
do in your garden but as long as you've

930
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,679
got an outcome that you're smoking

931
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:09,519
you're not doing it wrong there are a

932
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:12,559
thousand ways to skin a cat there are

933
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:13,759
probably a thousand ways to grow a plant

934
00:32:12,558 --> 00:32:15,038
that's the beauty of it that's why i

935
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:17,599
love it that's part of what i love about

936
00:32:15,038 --> 00:32:19,679
cannabis i can do it my way i've been

937
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:21,278
doing it my way i've been establishing

938
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:23,759
developing and i don't want to say

939
00:32:21,278 --> 00:32:25,839
perfecting but honing my way for several

940
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:27,119
years now to the ability to the effect

941
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:30,319
of the level where i feel like i can

942
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:32,158
teach you guys to follow my my standard

943
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:34,879
operating procedure and have great

944
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:37,360
success but i also encourage you to do

945
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:39,519
it your way your grow is not the same as

946
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:41,839
mine your lights are not the same as

947
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:43,599
mine your plants aren't the same as mine

948
00:32:41,839 --> 00:32:44,879
you may have an astronomical [ __ ]

949
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:46,398
budget you could buy all those new

950
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,679
lights that came out last week that i've

951
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:49,599
been looking at going when do they come

952
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:52,000
out with this one and you may not have

953
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:53,918
any budget at all you may be duct taping

954
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,519
[ __ ] old street lamps to the ceiling

955
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:57,200
to make that work we've all got a

956
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:59,759
different set up we've all got the same

957
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,919
goal our goal is to grow the best herb

958
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:03,599
that we can so that whenever we hang out

959
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:05,600
whenever we don't feel right whenever we

960
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:08,000
want to feel better we can smoke the

961
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:09,519
best herb that is available and we can

962
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,278
produce it ourselves and not have to

963
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:15,038
rely on anybody else all right i think i

964
00:33:13,278 --> 00:33:17,200
