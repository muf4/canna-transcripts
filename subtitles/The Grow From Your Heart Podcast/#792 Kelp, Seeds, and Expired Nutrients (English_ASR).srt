show I do have a fun opening subject to

22
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:04,680
jump into I do want to talk about

23
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:06,420
expired nutrients that's right I'm

24
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,740
working with a friend online who's been

25
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,939
asking me a bunch of questions we've

26
00:01:07,739 --> 00:01:11,399
been trying to figure out why they're

27
00:01:08,938 --> 00:01:13,199
grow just doesn't look right we've

28
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,700
checked on the water we've checked on

29
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,040
the soil we've checked on the nutrients

30
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,478
we checked on the uh the lights we

31
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,400
checked on the feeding we checked on the

32
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:22,259
scheduling we checked on the runoff we

33
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,700
checked everything we could think of and

34
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:25,618
today it was discovered that we were

35
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,299
feeding those plants expired nutrients

36
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:28,560
I'm not at that grow personally I'm

37
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:30,780
doing everything through email and

38
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,759
through FaceTime but they opened up a

39
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,618
bottle today and it smelled terrible and

40
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:36,180
they realized these nutrients are

41
00:01:34,618 --> 00:01:38,280
expired they've been in the growth for a

42
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:41,759
long time they did not realize that

43
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,560
bottle has met its time so my advice to

44
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,060
you is go in the grow and make sure that

45
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,320
none of your products are expired

46
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,519
because we've been chasing a problem

47
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:49,559
I've been trying to help a friend in

48
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:51,420
their grow for quite a while and they

49
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,340
discover that the whole problem was an

50
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,659
expired bottle of nutrients I wasn't

51
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,040
there to smell it I wasn't there to

52
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:58,200
inspect it I don't know what it looked

53
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,340
or smelled like but maybe we would have

54
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,840
caught that earlier if we would have

55
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,579
just cracked it open given it a smell

56
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,040
because today they said it smelled

57
00:02:02,578 --> 00:02:06,959
terrible and putrid we think and assume

58
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,599
that that has been the culprit of our

59
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:11,098
plant problem in that facility so once

60
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,598
again my advice to you if you've had a

61
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:13,799
big bottle sitting on the shelf if

62
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:15,060
you've got a bunch of bottles that are

63
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,280
sitting around that you don't use very

64
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,780
often maybe give them a shake see if

65
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,699
they're maybe they've gotten runnier

66
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,318
maybe they've gotten chunky see if those

67
00:02:20,699 --> 00:02:24,299
products are still good maybe they smell

68
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:25,919
real bad maybe they're supposed to smell

69
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,719
bad and now they smell good it's hard to

70
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:29,339
tell with some grow nutrients but there

71
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:31,139
should be an expiration date printed on

72
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:33,479
those bottles my advice to you is go

73
00:02:31,139 --> 00:02:35,639
check and see if your products are out

74
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:36,780
of date also check your pesticides and

75
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:38,759
while you're at it check all of your

76
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:40,680
other gear as well let's do an inventory

77
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:42,359
let's just do a regroup while we're at

78
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,560
it go check everything while you're

79
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,480
checking the pesticides and the

80
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:48,000
nutrients doing inventory let's do a

81
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:49,500
restock order off that [ __ ] add gloves

82
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
to the list while you're doing it all

83
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,620
right so the main piece of advice I want

84
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,360
you to take away from there is make sure

85
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:56,280
the nutrients aren't expired we've been

86
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,140
feeding a grow for the past few weeks

87
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,459
with an expired bottle and the plants

88
00:02:58,139 --> 00:03:00,839
look like [ __ ] they don't look like [ __ ]

89
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:03,000
they just don't look turbo they should

90
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:05,340
be turbo by now they look kind of normal

91
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,659
and we wanted turbo so it's that expired

92
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:08,640
bottle that's making them slow down and

93
00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:10,500
not perky go check on your stuff all

94
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:12,598
right I do want to segue into the email

95

151
00:05:01,978 --> 00:05:06,899
strain episodes strain videos I do I of

152
00:05:04,918 --> 00:05:09,180
course am I re genetics premium seeds I

153
00:05:06,899 --> 00:05:10,799
make seeds for high regenetics and I do

154
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:12,300
put out episodes that highlight those

155
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,639
strains will teach you how to grow them

156
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:16,560
give you advice about those strains and

157
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,960
set you up for success with the seeds

00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,180
which we do make but in those episodes I

159
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:22,680
do mention a lot of kelp products I

160
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:24,600
don't mention any specific products but

161
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,100
I do mention kelp products quite

162
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,860
frequently I say that it's a good idea

163
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:31,500
to use kelp I feel like in

164
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:34,620
um in my opinion in my experience in

165
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:38,160
strains that are skunky funky earthy

166
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:40,560
cushy uh those strains that that smell

167
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,539
that Aroma that flavor that funk can be

168
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,399
enhanced and really brought out with the

169
00:05:42,538 --> 00:05:46,918
addition of kelp products I just feel

170
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:49,500
like it makes it if it's musty and funky

171
00:05:46,918 --> 00:05:51,359
kelp will make it mustier and funkier if

172
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,819
those are even real words as musty or a

173
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,280
real word it'll be more musty in my

174
00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:58,379
experience if you use that kelp Aroma

175
00:05:56,279 --> 00:06:00,179
and flavor are not the only benefits of

176
00:05:58,379 --> 00:06:02,579
using a kelp product I also feel like

177
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:05,038
the proper use of kelp will increase in

178
00:06:02,579 --> 00:06:06,779
Bud density and it always does help with

179
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:09,599
root development that think of that

180
00:06:06,779 --> 00:06:11,519
natural sea life kelp grows kelp is one

181
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,960
of the largest growing organic bodies on

182
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:14,279
Earth if I read that correctly I didn't

183
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:16,500
recite that the way that I read it but

184
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:18,659
kelp grows large you guys and imagine

185
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,978
feeding that BioLife to your ganja

186
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:21,360
plants they're gonna grow live they're

187
00:06:19,978 --> 00:06:23,339
going to grow large they're going to

188
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,560
love it so kelp is always good at

189
00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:27,779
enhances root growth it enhances flavor

190
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:30,538
Aroma and I also think it helps with Bud

191
00:06:27,779 --> 00:06:32,339
density so that is why I talk about kelp

192
00:06:30,538 --> 00:06:35,579
in a lot of those episodes anything

193
00:06:32,339 --> 00:06:37,679
that's skunky funky gassy cushy in that

194
00:06:35,579 --> 00:06:39,659
realm give it more kelp the fruity

195
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,160
things will like the kelp as well and it

196
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:43,319
will make the flavor stronger but I

197
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:46,380
really think it enhances that funkiness

198
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:48,080
of a naturally funky smelling plant so

199
00:06:46,379 --> 00:06:51,360
let's talk a little bit about it

200
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:53,159
elaborate on how I use kelp there are

201
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,720
several ways to make kelp available to

202
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,880
your plants there are liquid kelp

203
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,919
products there are dried kelp products

204
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:00,600
there's a kelp meal product it's all

205
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:01,740
about your approach to Growing it kind

206
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,780
of depends on how you want to do it

207
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:05,460
you've got age-old kelp which is a

208
00:07:03,779 --> 00:07:06,719
beautiful product age-old is a really

209
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:08,579
it's an old brand they've been around

210
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,139
for a long time they make a quality

211
00:07:08,579 --> 00:07:11,879
product and they've got a kelp specific

212
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:14,280
product so you're right in the right

213
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:16,620
wheelhouse there that is a liquid kelp

214
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:18,059
product another liquid kelp product I

215
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:20,519
would recommend that I really enjoy is

216
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:22,918
liquid Karma however that brand was

217
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:24,478
bought by somebody the Botanicare brand

218
00:07:22,918 --> 00:07:26,879
was bought by somebody which we try not

219
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:28,379
to buy their products so no matter how

220
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:30,180
great that product is I'm still torn

221
00:07:28,379 --> 00:07:32,339
sometimes when I do choose to buy it

222
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:34,259
that's called liquid Karma there's a

223
00:07:32,339 --> 00:07:36,179
brand out there called raw that makes a

224
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:38,939
powdered kelp product raw nutrients

225
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:41,280
they're powdered it's raw is the name of

226
00:07:38,939 --> 00:07:43,560
the brand they make a great powdered

227
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:46,198
kelp product and the folks that make Fox

228
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:49,800
Farms product make a kelp product that

229
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:52,080
is called kelp me kelp you all of those

230
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,340
products will be easy to use they're all

231
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:56,098
cost effective they're all quite

232
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:58,258
affordable the liquid Karma and some of

233
00:07:56,098 --> 00:08:00,418
your liquid kelp products can actually

234
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:02,340
be used as a foliar feed I would imagine

235
00:08:00,418 --> 00:08:04,500
you could use the raw powdered kelp as a

236
00:08:02,339 --> 00:08:06,478
foliar if you shake it up and dissolve

237
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,918
it really well before you apply it don't

238
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:09,779
quote me on that because I have not used

239
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:11,098
that product but most Health Products

240
00:08:09,779 --> 00:08:12,839
you can fold your feet as long as they

241
00:08:11,098 --> 00:08:14,579
don't gum up your system as long as they

242
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:16,219
aren't too too thick when you apply it

243
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:19,800
so that it doesn't clog up your plants

244
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:21,300
so how to use it how to use the kelp it

245
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:24,180
says so far that you have used the kelp

246
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:25,620
once and veg and uh one time week two

247
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:27,418
and flower so that's a good start

248
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:29,579
depending on the products you choose to

249
00:08:27,418 --> 00:08:30,899
use and how you were growing uh that

250
00:08:29,579 --> 00:08:33,299
will kind of dictate how you use the

251
00:08:30,899 --> 00:08:34,860
kelp let's talk about a couple of ways

252
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:37,139
that I would recommend using it I like

253
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:39,418
to grow in Cocoa so in Cocoa I would

254
00:08:37,139 --> 00:08:41,639
probably add a kelp product once a week

255
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:44,158
throughout most of the entire cycle of

256
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:46,620
that plant once it goes into its big veg

257
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:49,019
pot then I'm going to start adding some

258
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:51,299
sort of a kelp product weekly all the

259
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:52,919
way up to probably about week six or

260
00:08:51,299 --> 00:08:54,838
maybe even week seven of flower

261
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:57,778
depending on how long that plant is

262
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:59,459
going to go so from week early in veg

263
00:08:57,778 --> 00:09:02,039
all the way through veg all the way

264
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:04,079
through flour up until right about

265
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:06,059
almost pre-flush time basically I am

266
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:09,240
feeding a kelp product now the trick to

267
00:09:06,059 --> 00:09:11,159
that is I slowly increase that product I

268
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,659
can't tell you how many milliliters or

269
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:13,919
how many grams or how much to use

270
00:09:12,659 --> 00:09:16,199
because I'm not sure which product

271
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:18,240
you're going to use but my advice is

272
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,800
start low and then just work your way up

273
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,480
a little bit don't go drastic don't go

274
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:24,000
crazy but do increase a little bit

275
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,920
toward by the time you get done with the

276
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,720
flowering stage that you were probably

277
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:29,639
at the full recommended dose which is

278
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,200
written on that bottle but most of the

279
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:33,539
time I'll recommend feeding 50 percent

280
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,339
of the recommended recommended dosage of

281
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:37,139
a product because the plants usually

282
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:38,640
don't need what they recommend the

283
00:09:37,139 --> 00:09:40,080
nutrient company wants you to buy more

284
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:42,539
so they tell you to feed a little bit

285
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,639
extra start off with about 50 work your

286
00:09:42,539 --> 00:09:46,379
way up by the time you're done with the

287
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:48,659
kelp product that's when I think you

288
00:09:46,379 --> 00:09:51,000
should probably be at that 100 Mark so

289
00:09:48,659 --> 00:09:52,079
about week six and just slowly work your

290
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,299
way up to there it's not going to be

291
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,519
huge huge steps just gradual increases

292
00:09:54,299 --> 00:09:59,039
over every couple of weeks so with the

293
00:09:56,519 --> 00:10:01,200
liquid product in Cocoa I would do Cocoa

294
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:03,120
uh once a week and I would slowly Step

295
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,519
Up start low and then work your way up

296
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,899
to the recommended dosage by the end

297
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,860
um then what else how else are we going

298
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:10,320
to grow we're going to grow in a

299
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:12,480
soilless mix with a soilless mix I would

300
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,339
probably do it once again once per week

301
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,019
but I may go a little bit heavier with

302
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:18,120
the dosage this time I may not go as

303
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:19,740
light as I do in Coco now what's left I

304
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:22,080
wrote down hydro hydro is our last

305
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:24,419
option to work with I would do Hydro

306
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,800
very similarly to the other two but in a

307
00:10:24,419 --> 00:10:27,659
hydro Reservoir you can only feed

308
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:28,859
basically we're feeding once a week you

309
00:10:27,659 --> 00:10:31,319
mix it up and let it run for the week

310
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:32,940
and in a hydro res so I would do it

311
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,560
basically every week from the time the

312
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:36,720
plants get big and established and get

313
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:38,338
sturdy and Healthy Start adding that

314
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,278
kelp product and just like I said before

315
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:43,080
start low and then work your way up and

316
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:45,299
those Hydro buckets and in Cocoa you're

317
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:47,160
definitely going to notice the kelp

318
00:10:45,299 --> 00:10:49,319
products more quickly than you are in

319
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:51,659
the soilless mix now if you want to add

320
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:54,120
this to some sort of a living soil or

321
00:10:51,659 --> 00:10:56,219
one of those no-till beds uh disclaimer

322
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,440
this is not my area of expertise when it

323
00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:00,240
comes to no-till Organics things like

324
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,920
that that is not my area of expertise

325
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,980
but that is when you're going to want to

326
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:06,539
stir in that kelp product early in stir

327
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:08,399
that in before you I mix it into the

328
00:11:06,539 --> 00:11:10,199
soil before you even start putting the

329
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,480
plants in then you might want to top

330
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:14,040
dress or top feed it later on with the

331
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,259
kelp product you could put the kelp in

332
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:17,939
with water feed it that way or you can

333
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:20,338
top dress it let it break down into the

334
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:22,680
soil that way once again I am not the

335
00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:25,320
Organics expert but those are two three

336
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:28,319
very viable options to get plants the

337
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:31,019
kelp product if you are using organic so

338
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:33,480
quick recap up there Hydro basically

339
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:35,459
Hydro soilless mix cocoa almost

340
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:37,259
everything I would feed it once per week

341
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:38,759
and I would start low and I would

342
00:11:37,259 --> 00:11:40,139
gradually taper up until you're going

343
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:41,939
about a hundred percent maybe a little

344
00:11:40,139 --> 00:11:45,179
bit more if you really want to push it

345
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:47,459
120 of what the recommended dosage is at

346
00:11:45,179 --> 00:11:48,778
the end start low and work your way up

347
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:50,399
you guys that's what I'm saying don't go

348
00:11:48,778 --> 00:11:51,720
burning the plants and pay attention

349
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,299
just because I'm saying that you can get

350
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:55,920
to 100 maybe 120 doesn't mean that your

351
00:11:54,299 --> 00:11:58,019
plant is going to take that all of these

352
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:59,879
plants are a little bit different so pay

353
00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:01,919
really close attention to your plant are

354
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:03,720
the leaves curling is the growth stunted

355
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:05,519
is something going weird that could be a

356
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:07,980
sign so back off if you see too much

357
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,659
reaction from that all right I think I

358
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:11,759
answered this question elaborate on how

359
00:12:09,659 --> 00:12:13,319
I use the kelp feed it just like any

360
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:15,539
other nutrient and feed it about once a

361
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:17,040
week and then start early and work your

362
00:12:15,539 --> 00:12:19,439
way on up until you're going kind of

363
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:21,599
hard with the kelp I think the gassier

364
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,760
and funkier uh

365
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,700
cushier sort of varietals the chem dogs

366
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:28,620
and things they really love this sort of

367
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:30,778
treatment they really love the can of

368
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:32,159
the kelp products also the cushes and

369
00:12:30,778 --> 00:12:34,559
chems if you're going to do some kelp

370
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:35,699
add some cow mag to that mix as well and

371
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:37,619
they will really love each other

372
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:39,000

383
00:12:56,759 --> 00:13:01,860
one more message here this one came also

384
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:03,660
from The Grow help tab from does it say

385
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:05,278
what they want their name to be does not

386
00:13:03,659 --> 00:13:07,620
have their name on it it goes like this

387
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:09,659
it says yo Rasta Jeff you inspired me to

388
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:11,820
start breeding and I'm not gonna lie to

389
00:13:09,659 --> 00:13:14,519
you I'm going to start my line with your

390
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:17,100
line and I chose Saka souffle to start

391
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:19,019
my breeding project that is a huge

392
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:20,940
compliment many breeders out there get

393
00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:22,560
pissy and get territorial when people

394
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:25,260
talk about breeding with their products

395
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:27,359
but guess what not me I agree I promote

396
00:13:25,259 --> 00:13:29,039
it I endorse it I condone it I really

397
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,079
encourage people to breed with my

398
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:33,120
products first of all if you want to

399
00:13:31,078 --> 00:13:34,739
breed with my products that that's a

400
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,659
compliment to me why would I be mad that

401
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:38,339
you want to use my Creations to start

402
00:13:36,659 --> 00:13:40,860
your new Creations that's a huge

403
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:42,480
compliment to me thank you also why

404
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:43,800
would I be mad at a person for trying to

405
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,680
breed their own cannabis and make

406
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:48,240
themselves uh self-sustainable and enjoy

407
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:50,219
cannabis a little bit more enjoy the

408
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,720
plant the craft the art develop some

409
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:54,540
skills why would I be mad at anybody

410
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:56,339
about that and then the bottom line is

411
00:13:54,539 --> 00:13:58,379
here you bought those seeds bro those

412
00:13:56,339 --> 00:13:59,760
are yours you paid money for them or you

413
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:01,620
traded for them hopefully you did it

414
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:03,659
honestly uh if you got those seeds

415
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:05,278
honestly then you can grow them breed

416
00:14:03,659 --> 00:14:06,838
them trade them sell them you could do

417
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:08,039
whatever you want with them I can't say

418
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:09,420
anything about it I've got the money

419
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:11,819
that I needed when you bought them and

420
00:14:09,419 --> 00:14:13,078
after that bro it's all yours have a

421
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:15,180
good time that's like you telling me

422
00:14:13,078 --> 00:14:17,159
that I can't skate my skateboard hard or

423
00:14:15,179 --> 00:14:19,078
drive my car fast I paid for it I'm

424
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:20,519
Gonna Do My Thing bro you do that thing

425
00:14:19,078 --> 00:14:22,500
with your seeds but I want to keep going

426
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:24,600
I I appreciate that and encourage it

427
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:27,179
breed with my stuff it goes on I chose

428
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,500
Saka souffle uh biscotti is my favorite

429
00:14:27,179 --> 00:14:30,539
strain you're gonna find a great

430
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,860
biscotti flavored meal in there it says

431
00:14:30,539 --> 00:14:34,078
I have a couple of questions for you

432
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:36,539
when you make seeds how long do you veg

433
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:38,278
your plants if you were in my position

434
00:14:36,539 --> 00:14:40,198
and chose Saka souffle to start your

435
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:41,838
breeding project how long would you veg

436
00:14:40,198 --> 00:14:44,698
it since you know that particular

437
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:46,199
cultivar very well there's a couple of

438
00:14:44,698 --> 00:14:48,599
things that get my attention in here

439
00:14:46,198 --> 00:14:51,059
first of all I would recommend if you're

440
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:53,579
going to breed with this plant that you

441
00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:55,259
grow out several phenotypes of multiple

442
00:14:53,578 --> 00:14:56,939
times and get a relationship with it

443
00:14:55,259 --> 00:14:58,259
you're going to do a Fino hunt I'm

444
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:00,480
assuming you've got a 10 which probably

445
00:14:58,259 --> 00:15:02,458
came with 12 seeds in the pack so you've

446
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,778
got 10 or 12 seeds maybe uh maybe you

447
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:05,219
share that with a friend but I'm gonna

448
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:07,379
say grow as many seeds as you can

449
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:09,000
identify the females identify the males

450
00:15:07,379 --> 00:15:11,220
separate them

451
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,019
and then flour them out and find what is

452
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,800
the best for you you're going to find a

453
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:16,019
male

454
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:17,338
that looks like he's the St the dude the

455
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:19,019
stud the guy

456
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:20,639
keep him aside now we've got to run the

457
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:22,198
females a couple of times we want to see

458
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,698
unless you want to pollinate multiple

459
00:15:22,198 --> 00:15:25,740
females if you just want to do one and

460
00:15:23,698 --> 00:15:27,299
one you really have to do some careful

461
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:29,519
selection and you can't do that on just

462
00:15:27,299 --> 00:15:31,559
one run I'd recommend running it two

463
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,899
maybe three times unless you plan on

464
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:35,939
pollinating everything so I would run it

465
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:37,679
the first time find the boys find the

466
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:38,820
girls kind of this is just an audition

467
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:40,078
run we're just kind of getting to know

468
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:42,300
them in the second run we're really

469
00:15:40,078 --> 00:15:43,620
gonna isolate two or three girls that we

470
00:15:42,299 --> 00:15:45,059
really like and see which one is the

471
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:46,919
best and then we'll breed to that let's

472
00:15:45,059 --> 00:15:48,778
grow it a little bit find out if there's

473
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:51,059
any problems with this plant I doubt

474
00:15:48,778 --> 00:15:52,919
there will be but I could have problems

475
00:15:51,059 --> 00:15:54,539
it could be I bread this plant and I'm

476
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:56,399
still gonna say it it could be intersex

477
00:15:54,539 --> 00:15:57,719
it could be a mutant it could be a

478
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,698
[ __ ] freak Show of a plant that

479
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:02,639
doesn't do what you want done so let's

480
00:15:59,698 --> 00:16:04,198
not get too uh too attached to breeding

481
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:05,940
with this plant right away because it

482
00:16:04,198 --> 00:16:07,740
may not fit the criteria which you're

483
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:09,660
hoping for just because your favorite

484
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:11,100
plant is biscotti and there's biscotti

485
00:16:09,659 --> 00:16:12,958
in here doesn't mean that this is going

486
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:14,459
to be a breeding winner and I would like

487
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:16,439
to say it is because I made it but still

488
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:18,539
it may not be that's the chances of

489
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:20,940
reality that's chances of genetics

490
00:16:18,539 --> 00:16:22,740
that's like it's like dating maybe we're

491
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:25,260
not gonna get along maybe you're the

492
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:27,120
plant and that and you aren't gonna get

493
00:16:25,259 --> 00:16:28,319
along well that's the bottom line so run

494
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,940
them a couple times let's see if it's

495
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,160
really what you want before you do the

496
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:34,139
breeding now let's talk on touch on the

497
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:36,000
actual breeding question how big would I

498
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:36,899
veg the plants this is a really good

499
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,639
question

500
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:40,740
uh maybe I shouldn't tell you all this

501
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:43,500
information but come on in it's time to

502
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:45,000
uh reveal some some breeding secrets you

503
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:47,339
don't really need a lot of space or

504
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,500
really big plants to create a lot of

505
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:51,060
seeds honestly if you're going to breed

506
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:53,578
with the biscotti and you just want to

507
00:16:51,059 --> 00:16:55,979
make seeds for yourself you can make a

508
00:16:53,578 --> 00:16:57,659
hundred seeds from a plant grown in a

509
00:16:55,980 --> 00:17:00,180
beer cup I am not joking I'm not

510
00:16:57,659 --> 00:17:02,879
exaggerating at all a beer cup is this

511
00:17:00,179 --> 00:17:04,259
tall you can veg the plant to be this

512
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:06,298
tall ish I don't know if you're watching

513
00:17:04,259 --> 00:17:07,798
on the video but that's half maybe three

514
00:17:06,298 --> 00:17:10,078
quarters the size of the beer cups This

515
00:17:07,798 --> 00:17:11,879
Tall Veg it's about half three quarters

516
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:13,980
the size of the beer cup and then flip

517
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:15,419
it and then pollinate if you pollinate

518
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:17,400
two or three of those plants that are

519
00:17:15,419 --> 00:17:19,380
the same size all of the same clone

520
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:21,660
you're going to make a couple hundred

521
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:23,880
seeds probably 100 to 200 seeds really

522
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:26,040
easily if the plant's real little you'll

523
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:28,260
still pull 30 to 50 seeds off of it you

524
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:30,359
don't need a lot of biomass to pollinate

525
00:17:28,259 --> 00:17:31,379
the plants they can be really little if

526
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:33,959
you just want to make some for yourself

527
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:35,940
my advice is to veg them in cups get

528
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:37,319
them about what is that GI Joe is three

529
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:39,900
and three quarters of an inch all

530
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:41,939
vegetable GI Joe tall and then flour

531
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:43,500
them the male and the female at the same

532
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:45,720
time put them in there let them go

533
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:47,400
that's going to be a good first practice

534
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:49,259
breeding run you'll see what the flowers

535
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,700
what the male plant does all the way

536
00:17:49,259 --> 00:17:51,900
through the flowering cycle you'll see

537
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:53,880
what the females do you'll see what

538
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:55,440
pollination looks like you'll see what

539
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:57,480
ripe and mature seeds look like you'll

540
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,580
see how long it takes and you'll have a

541
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,960
good batch of seeds to play with if you

542
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:02,579
really want to get Critical with it you

543
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,960
can time the male and female differently

544
00:18:02,579 --> 00:18:05,159
I don't know when the male is going to

545
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,380
dump pollen I don't know when the female

546
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:09,120
will be ready for pollen exactly because

547
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:11,100
I haven't ran these plants yet but the

548
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:12,899
way nature works if you put them side by

549
00:18:11,099 --> 00:18:14,699
side and put them into flour they will

550
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:16,320
the pollination will work you may make

551
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:18,360
more seeds if you do one earlier one

552
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:20,279
later but let's worry about that on your

553
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:21,959
second and third breeding runs let's

554
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:23,700
just put the appropriate boy and

555
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:25,019
appropriate girl in there and put them

556
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:27,360
in at the same time and you'll make

557
00:18:25,019 --> 00:18:28,980
plenty of seeds for yourself so if you

558
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:30,779
want to make just enough seeds for

559
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:33,480
yourself to play with beer cups one

560
00:18:30,779 --> 00:18:37,379
gallon pots small plants you just need

561
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:39,480
one top Cola the size of human and I

562
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:42,240
know I'm using [ __ ] toys from the 90s

563
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:44,759
and 80s as size reference today but uh

564
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:47,460
vegetal it's GI Joe and a he-man size

565
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:48,900
plant will give you 30 to 50 seeds if

566
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,700
you do it properly sometimes you'll get

567
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:52,140
90 to 100 seeds out of a little tiny

568
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:54,480
plant it just depends on how much

569
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:56,520
biomass is on that plant to receive how

570
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,860
many pistols are there to receive pollen

571
00:18:56,519 --> 00:19:00,359
to create seeds out of those plants if

572
00:18:58,859 --> 00:19:02,519
you want to make more seeds grow bigger

573
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:04,500
plants but honestly the beer cup method

574
00:19:02,519 --> 00:19:06,660
is really simple to do and it does not

575
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:08,220
take a lot of space just make sure that

576
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:09,600
those seeds get time to finish that's

577
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:12,480
going to be one of the most important

578
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:15,058
things select your female or females

579
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:17,099
select your mail get a clone have

580
00:19:15,058 --> 00:19:18,480
backups have backup plants of these in

581
00:19:17,099 --> 00:19:19,980
case something goes wrong and so that we

582
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,019
can replicate this procedure in the

583
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:24,779
future you got your backups get clones

584
00:19:22,019 --> 00:19:26,220
put the Clones into the beer cups get

585
00:19:24,779 --> 00:19:27,899
those beer cups growing about the size

586
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:30,120
of GI Joe three and three quarters of an

587
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:32,038
inch tall put the male and female or

588
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:33,599
females into your flowering chamber I'm

589
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:35,279
not even saying flowering room at this

590
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:36,719
time because these plants are so little

591
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:38,099
they get a chamber they don't need a

592
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,620
whole room to themselves they just need

593
00:19:38,099 --> 00:19:42,480
you can do this in a a very small a two

594
00:19:40,619 --> 00:19:44,159
by two by four foot space you could

595
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,779
definitely bang out plenty of seeds with

596
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,340
the right light with the right cooling

597
00:19:45,779 --> 00:19:49,019
with the right ventilation with paying

598
00:19:47,339 --> 00:19:51,000
the right attention and timing things so

599
00:19:49,019 --> 00:19:53,220
put them in that room let them pollinate

600
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,019
they'll get it on and then six seven

601
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:57,298
eight or nine weeks from there you will

602
00:19:55,019 --> 00:19:58,859
have a small batch of seeds then here's

603
00:19:57,298 --> 00:20:00,418
the fun part you get to grow all of

604
00:19:58,859 --> 00:20:02,279
those seeds don't share them don't give

605
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:03,900
them away until you've ran a few and

606
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:06,538
verified that they're not problematic

607
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:07,740
until you're confident in those seeds so

608
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:09,119
let me check on the message and make

609
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:11,339
sure that I actually answered some of

610
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:13,199
your question here uh when you make

611
00:20:11,339 --> 00:20:15,659
seeds how long do you let your plants

612
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,980
veg if I was in your position so yeah I

613
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:18,360
would do it in beer cups honestly you're

614
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,740
just trying to make a few seeds we don't

615
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:21,298
know if these seeds are going to be

616
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:22,620
amazing we don't know if they're going

617
00:20:21,298 --> 00:20:24,179
to be intersex we don't know if they're

618
00:20:22,619 --> 00:20:25,558
going to be Duds we don't know what

619
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:27,419
you're we're creating so let's not make

620
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:30,480
too many of them it's easy to throw away

621
00:20:27,419 --> 00:20:32,820
90 seeds it really hurts your feelings

622
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,140
to throw away 9 000 seats trust me I've

623
00:20:32,819 --> 00:20:36,178
had to do it before it's the only thing

624
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:37,919
you can do put them in the compost bin

625
00:20:36,179 --> 00:20:39,298
because if I put those seeds out to you

626
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,440
guys you're going to be angry at me

627
00:20:39,298 --> 00:20:42,538
you're not going to be happy it's going

628
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:45,360
to tarnish the reputation the level of

629
00:20:42,538 --> 00:20:48,058
quality that you expect from me so make

630
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:49,678
little plants make a few and maybe to

631
00:20:48,058 --> 00:20:52,019
you 100 is a bunch of seeds make a few

632
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:54,000
seeds to play with grow them then we can

633
00:20:52,019 --> 00:20:55,200
always go back and make more and if you

634
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,298
did it right you probably found the

635
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,640
keeper that you want and that 30 to 50

636
00:20:57,298 --> 00:21:01,259
seeds anyway there will be something hot

637
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:03,000
in there if you've done this properly

638
00:21:01,259 --> 00:21:04,798
I'm really curious if you're going to

639
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,140
use my Saka souffle as a male plant

640
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:08,879
which females are you going to pollinate

641
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:11,220
are there is there more advice on that

642
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,720
yeah you're gonna use the Saka souffle

643
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:14,160
um what are you going to pollinate what

644
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,900
uh what is the other plant in the mix

645
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:19,140
here

646
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:21,000
no no advice on that one but um I'm

647
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:22,320
excited I and once again I do encourage

648
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,819

pot you can make a lot of plants if you

658
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:42,659
let that plant veg up to 12 or 18 inches
