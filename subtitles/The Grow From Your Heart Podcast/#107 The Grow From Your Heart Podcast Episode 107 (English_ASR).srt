actually went up today Thursday the 19th

70
00:02:17,938 --> 00:02:22,169

00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:23,700
on picking it up it's only got one

72
00:02:22,169 --> 00:02:24,899
second of the show posted so I've

73
00:02:23,699 --> 00:02:27,628
emailed stitcher and let them know that

74
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:29,188
there's an issue usually stitcher just

75
00:02:27,628 --> 00:02:31,259
goes and corrects it really quickly the

76
00:02:29,188 --> 00:02:33,180
show is it's available on iTunes it's

77
00:02:31,259 --> 00:02:35,310

more thing I want to talk about before

107
00:03:29,908 --> 00:03:35,158
we start getting down to the heart of

108
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:38,068
the show guys I got a screenshot of

109
00:03:35,158 --> 00:03:40,679
something um so we put a lot of work

110
00:03:38,068 --> 00:03:41,969
into this podcast I take time out of my

111
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,349
day to take time out of my life Mike

112
00:03:41,969 --> 00:03:45,628
takes time away from his family to come

113
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:47,280
over here and record Mike works 40

114
00:03:45,628 --> 00:03:48,840
something hours a week in the spot so

115
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,908
getting him to come over for an hour is

116
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,829
actually a little effort I got an email

117
00:03:50,908 --> 00:03:54,840
that makes all of our time all of our

118
00:03:52,829 --> 00:03:56,849
effort worthwhile these are the emails

119
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,949
that really make it worth putting in the

120
00:03:56,848 --> 00:04:01,469
energy so this came from somebody will

121
00:03:58,949 --> 00:04:03,840
just call it Mike oh and he says the

122
00:04:01,469 --> 00:04:05,340
podcast is great best show I've listened

123
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,900
best show and I've listened to them all

124
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,699
hoping you will do more shows with

125
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:10,408
longer content like the earlier episodes

126
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:13,739
I would like to see a pest management

127
00:04:10,408 --> 00:04:15,598
episode and more BHO shows I'm in

00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:27,300
and then he keeps her going for a minute

135
00:04:26,459 --> 00:04:30,000

184
00:06:00,538 --> 00:06:03,538
topic we want to talk about here but I

185
00:06:02,009 --> 00:06:05,550
want to talk about one more thing since

186
00:06:03,538 --> 00:06:08,490
uh since Mike is a little familiar with

187
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:11,639
this region of life I got the privilege

188
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:16,319
on Monday morning of going to jury duty

189
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:17,550
at 8 a.m. on a cold ass Monday yep I got

190
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,129
lucky the last time I to do it was

191
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:21,870
during the summer at least I wasn't cold

192
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:23,639
right yeah you gotta be there bright and

193
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:25,288
early and it's [ __ ] cold and wet it

194
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:26,930
was so windy was one of the windiest

195
00:06:25,288 --> 00:06:30,269
days of the year that's crazy you had

196
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:32,968
jury duty I'm really nasty yeah it was

197
00:06:30,269 --> 00:06:35,098
weird because the the courtroom has

198
00:06:32,968 --> 00:06:37,468
skylight sort of windows that are kind

199
00:06:35,098 --> 00:06:40,050
of tinted behind the judge and they were

200
00:06:37,468 --> 00:06:40,430
changing from black to baby blue to

201
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:42,829
black

202
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:44,209
with the weather every like 10 minutes I

203
00:06:42,829 --> 00:06:45,560
was like holy [ __ ] what's going on

204
00:06:44,209 --> 00:06:48,289
outside that was crazy

205
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:50,269
so I had jury duty and obviously I was

206
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:52,580
not selected I have never selected to be

207
00:06:50,269 --> 00:06:53,839
a part of the jury I get down to when

208
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:57,740
they start asking questions and they're

209
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:59,269
like oh you can go home but uh I went in

210
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:00,710
there with a certain thing in mind of

211
00:06:59,269 --> 00:07:03,199
what I was going to see and experience

212
00:07:00,709 --> 00:07:05,389
and how I was gonna handle [ __ ] and it

213
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:07,370
was nothing like what I expected no it's

214
00:07:05,389 --> 00:07:10,610
it's not at all like it appears on

215
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:12,199
television exactly and the chairs are

216
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:14,360
just isn't comfortable as they appear on

217
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:15,920
television if not significantly more so

218
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,750
but other than that very few

219
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:19,730
similarities it was like they were mad

220
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:22,490
at us and made us sit in shitty church

221
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:24,470
pews it when you're in them it feels

222
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:27,319
like it was designed to punish everyone

223
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:29,390
that was selected significantly yes so

224
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:31,670
Wow the thing that stood out the most to

225
00:07:29,389 --> 00:07:34,250
me I'm afraid of judges just straight-up

226
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:36,439
a judge can say you are going to jail

227
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:38,000
and you get to do some time in jail you

228
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:39,800
get to go get but poke for a little bit

229
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,769
and there's nothing you can do about it

230
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:46,490
yeah the judge that resided over that

231
00:07:42,769 --> 00:07:48,079
courtroom was cool as [ __ ] like I don't

232
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:51,199
know the judge personally but he

233
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:52,759
presented himself fairly I didn't feel

234
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:55,250
like he was passing judgment on anybody

235
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:57,259
by the way they looked he treated the

236
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:59,629
guys in suits and the lady in her sweat

237
00:07:57,259 --> 00:08:02,389
pants exactly the same he was kind

238
00:07:59,629 --> 00:08:03,709
everybody who was respectful and he was

239
00:08:02,389 --> 00:08:05,240
a human about things I figured it was

240
00:08:03,709 --> 00:08:07,069
gonna be rigorous in like the time

241
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,780
everything would be on a certain time

242
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:09,649
schedule and stuff and he went for a

243
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:10,849
little bit of time and he goes does

244
00:08:09,649 --> 00:08:12,349
anybody need to use a restroom or

245
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:14,629
anything can we wait another 15 minutes

246
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:15,860
and everyone's like I can wait 15 he's

247
00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:16,850
like okay we'll go in 15 minutes you

248
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:18,439
guys don't worry and he looked up the

249
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:19,430
clock oh sorry it's been about 20

250
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:21,529
minutes you guys let's go use the

251
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:23,870
restroom we'll take 15 and like he was

252
00:08:21,529 --> 00:08:26,779
actually pretty cool so you know they're

253
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:29,860
at this point for the most part it runs

254
00:08:26,779 --> 00:08:33,350
like it should like it's much more

255
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:35,720
functional in I don't know human that a

256
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:37,550
lot of people assume I know judges like

257
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:39,710
I've met many of them is right there are

258
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:41,000
people too and that's what I said Mike's

259
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:43,129
a little more in that realm Mike has

260
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,590
experience in that side of life and I uh

261
00:08:43,129 --> 00:08:46,730
I'm the dreadlock I I've got dreadlocks

262
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:50,210
to my ass I got red eyes

263
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:52,789
I smell like cannabis most of the time I

264
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:53,670
try to avoid those types of folks but

265
00:08:52,789 --> 00:08:55,349
you know now things are

266
00:08:53,669 --> 00:08:56,759
engine I'm gonna have to mingle and rub

267
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:59,279
some elbows with those types of people

268
00:08:56,759 --> 00:09:01,620
but the judge was very fair I did not

269
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:04,279
feel intimidated I didn't feel afraid it

270
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:07,019
was really cool it may have given me a

271
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:09,209
touch of faith in our system maybe a

272
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:11,279
touch more it's nice to know that

273
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:13,550
there's at least humans involved like

274
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:16,049
we've seen it from just the juror

275
00:09:13,549 --> 00:09:18,449
selection part they didn't kick us out

276
00:09:16,049 --> 00:09:20,490
they didn't kick out the rejected jurors

277
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:22,290
until all of the jurors had been chosen

278
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:24,180
so that they knew that there were enough

279
00:09:22,289 --> 00:09:26,159
in the pool and I got to watch the

280
00:09:24,179 --> 00:09:28,019
selection process and I got to watch all

281
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:31,199
of the jurors to be interviewed and then

282
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:32,970
at the end of that the two lawyers the

283
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,160
prosecutor the prosecution and the

284
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:36,810
defense pass back and forth a piece of

285
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:39,059
paper and they agree on which people are

286
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:40,619
gonna be the jurors and I was laughing

287
00:09:39,059 --> 00:09:42,149
is like it's like fantasy football for

288
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:43,769
the Warriors or something yep and

289
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:45,809
they're like I'll trade you the angry

290
00:09:43,769 --> 00:09:47,370
white guy for the passive white lady and

291
00:09:45,809 --> 00:09:48,750
like I could just see him negotiating I

292
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:50,159
knew who was gonna go home I was like

293
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:52,289
they're gonna get rid of that guy like

294
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:53,490
he's too angry and he's too mad he wants

295
00:09:52,289 --> 00:09:56,189
this guy to go to jail before he's even

296
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:58,230
heard the case we the last two times I

297
00:09:56,190 --> 00:10:00,600
went the the first time I got let go

298
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:02,220
before any of that started even I never

299
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,320
even made it to the courtroom they

300
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:07,860
called it all but like 20 of us and like

301
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:09,180
the rest you know like just no ceremony

302
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:10,740
but we didn't have to sign out or

303
00:10:09,179 --> 00:10:12,209
nothing they don't care the first time I

304
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:14,310
went that's what happened there was a

305
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:16,320
case that we were gonna see that day and

306
00:10:14,309 --> 00:10:18,149
the lady that was supposed to be in that

307
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,730
case committed another crime and it been

308
00:10:18,149 --> 00:10:22,919
reading to jail and was gonna be retried

309
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:24,300
for all of her [ __ ] so yeah she got me

310
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:26,879
at a jury duty that day but she [ __ ]

311
00:10:24,299 --> 00:10:30,599
up her life and then the last time they

312
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:33,419
uh they got down to like 30 people that

313
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:36,060
they liked and they just waved that the

314
00:10:33,419 --> 00:10:37,529
rest of us when I go home and so we all

315
00:10:36,059 --> 00:10:39,419
got to go home at lunch which was nice

316

I don't have to work tomorrow ain't got

334
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:12,629
[ __ ] to do I wouldn't mind being

335
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:14,310
selected for a case it would have been

336
00:11:12,629 --> 00:11:16,860
kind of fun it would have been a very

337
00:11:14,309 --> 00:11:19,859
learning experience for myself yeah I

338
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:21,990
hate to imagine it but now if I'm ever

339
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:23,250
in court I know how it goes yep and I've

340
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:25,350
got a little experience it's I'm not

341
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:27,149
gonna [ __ ] my pants the first time um I

342
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:28,139
want to invite Mike while he's sitting

343
00:11:27,149 --> 00:11:29,789
here in friend me we'll get a commitment

344
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:31,559
out of him you guys I want you to come

345
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:33,149
to an episode with me about how to deal

346
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:35,399
with you how to conduct yourself with a

347
00:11:33,149 --> 00:11:36,809
law enforcement oh sure whether you're

348
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:38,100
being pulled over whether they come to

349
00:11:36,809 --> 00:11:40,439
your home whether you're in public

350
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:42,960
whether you're at a smoking event I'd

351
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,980
like to get you and we'll get somebody

352
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:46,350
else on the show too I have a good idea

353
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:48,029
of who we're gonna get on the show I

354
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:51,149
think we're gonna get sloppy and you on

355
00:11:48,029 --> 00:11:52,379
the show because that's that that'll

356
00:11:51,149 --> 00:11:53,730
make for a really interesting show

357
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:56,480
that's for sure yes sloppy you're

358
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:58,529
invited we have such different exactly

359
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,690
experiences with law enforcement yes

360
00:11:58,529 --> 00:12:01,799
yeah yeah and I want to get both you

361
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:03,870
guys on the show and we can talk about

362
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:04,889
how to deal we'll talk about how to deal

363
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:06,990
with the law enforcement and not get

364
00:12:04,889 --> 00:12:08,220
your ass thrown in jail all right guys

365
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:09,720
so I must have blown a couple of dabs

366
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,950
into the computer because as I was

367
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,690
saying that part about the judge it

368
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:14,430
totally just quit recording here here we

369
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:16,290
got too high the computer is too dabbed

370
00:12:14,429 --> 00:12:17,639
out something went wrong that means that

371
00:12:16,289 --> 00:12:21,329
we're gonna have to start running an

372
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:24,750
auxilary output from the the USB down

373
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:26,250
here or the mixer into the h6 and do or

374
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,600
record this [ __ ] in case that happens

375
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:30,000
again and then I can just keep recording

376
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,250
the h6 would have kept going nice yeah

377
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,259
or we'll go get a little Roland handheld

378
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:36,389
recorder and use the headphone out on

379
00:12:34,259 --> 00:12:37,860
the mixer and then just run that into

380
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:39,509
the handheld recorder and that just

381
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:41,310
records onto an SD card so there's no

382
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:42,750
failure the age six would work

383
00:12:41,309 --> 00:12:44,219
the handheld would work we'll do

384
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:47,490
something like that as a back-up plan or

385
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:48,960
we can just take a DAB when it fails and

386
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:50,220
come back a couple of minutes later and

387
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:52,320
explain that we just had a major

388
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:54,090
technical failure here yeah I like the

389
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,830
third option that seems simplest it's

390
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:57,210
the cheapest y'all were wondering like

391
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:59,190
what kind of equipment we're doing the

392
00:12:57,210 --> 00:13:02,550
show with Jeff's got a pile of equipment

393
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:04,470
that's larger than your car well this is

394
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:05,639
the home setup this is where this is so

395
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:08,190
that you can get the voice like there is

396
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:10,199
a cast that's that's what that's what is

397
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:12,240
for all this but home based versions

398
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:14,520
pretty elaborate yeah yeah yeah the to

399
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,560
go version is the size of a big cell

400
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:18,509
phone basically yeah when you hear me

401
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:20,250
recording the Morrises cell phone maybe

402
00:13:18,509 --> 00:13:21,740
yeah Zack Morris is older cell phone

403
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:24,139
that's the truth we just went [ __ ]

404
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:26,330
Saved by the Bell on this [ __ ] all right

405
00:13:24,139 --> 00:13:28,340
you guys the program crashed we had to

406
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:30,139
restart it I just give you the trash

407
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,889
didn't had to restart that's the truth

408
00:13:30,139 --> 00:13:32,330
that is the truth

409
00:13:30,889 --> 00:13:33,980
I just given a shout out to the judge

410
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:34,940
that resided over that courtroom I felt

411
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,980
that it was fair I liked the way he

412
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:38,690
treated people I don't know how much of

413
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:40,159
that got recorded but I went to jury

414
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:42,080
duty you guys it wasn't that bad that

415
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:43,639
judge was cool it was fair I wanted to

416
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:46,730
move on from that and keep going while

417
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:48,919
the computer is working that email said

418
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:51,560
that they wish I'd do more girl lessons

419
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:53,059
ah that'll come you guys I'm working on

420
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:54,259
it I don't know if that got recorded in

421
00:13:53,059 --> 00:13:56,089
the part before so we may have just

422
00:13:54,259 --> 00:13:57,500
don't talk to that part if my girl

423
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:59,210

the appropriate people I don't know if

428
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:07,220
we're double talking so I don't know how

429
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:08,600
much that made it to the recording but

430

organic pesticide management episode and

451
00:14:48,259 --> 00:14:51,799
then I need to find ourselves some hash

452
00:14:50,419 --> 00:14:53,689
experts and we will do some hash

453
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:54,500
episodes I'm not a hash expert you guys

454
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:56,270

Spence is a busy [ __ ] so getting

456
00:14:56,269 --> 00:14:59,029
him to come over here is gonna cost me

457
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:01,159
like 50 bucks an hour to get him to come

458
00:14:59,029 --> 00:15:02,389
record all the time but we'll get a hash

459
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:04,549
expert we'll get him to come on the show

460
00:15:02,389 --> 00:15:05,629
let's get down to the point of the show

461
00:15:04,549 --> 00:15:06,829
you guys we're gonna go in for 15

462
00:15:05,629 --> 00:15:09,740
minutes and all we've done is talk a

463
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:11,540
bunch of nonsense um we've been covering

464
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:12,889
this a little bit lately I've got three

465
00:15:11,539 --> 00:15:14,569
news articles I'm going to read the

466
00:15:12,889 --> 00:15:15,799
headline two and then we're gonna skip

467
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:17,360
all of that and then we're gonna go to

468
00:15:15,799 --> 00:15:19,039
the main article that I want to talk

469
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,409
about but this is kind of a little bit

470
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:22,579
of a build-up on the on the website

471
00:15:21,409 --> 00:15:24,019
called the cannabis twitch is where I

472
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:25,759
find a lot of my news big shout out to

473
00:15:24,019 --> 00:15:27,049
David McCoy and Ricardo Baca for

474
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:29,990
supplying the world with up-to-date

475
00:15:27,049 --> 00:15:31,669
cannabis news from Colorado I found an

476
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:34,430
article this one was written on November

477
00:15:31,669 --> 00:15:35,539
13th and it says pesticide edict ensures

478
00:15:34,429 --> 00:15:37,698
fate of recalled

479
00:15:35,539 --> 00:15:39,919
for pot products the byline is nearly

480
00:15:37,698 --> 00:15:41,569
30,000 marijuana infused products

481
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:43,939
recalled over pesticide concerns will

482
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:47,180
likely be destroyed after Hickenlooper

483
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:49,160
says their public safety risk here's

484
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:51,078
another article just in the headline you

485
00:15:49,159 --> 00:15:52,490
guys is all I'm gonna read this one once

486
00:15:51,078 --> 00:15:55,370
again was in the cannabis that says

487
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:58,009
denver-based lab 710 recalls pot

488
00:15:55,370 --> 00:16:00,169
products / pesticides and then the

489
00:15:58,009 --> 00:16:02,778
byline is in the state's eighth pot

490
00:16:00,169 --> 00:16:04,939
recall in 10 months lab 710 concentrates

491
00:16:02,778 --> 00:16:07,189
calls back two thousand three hundred

492
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:09,860
and sixty two packages of marijuana

493
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:11,420
concentrates and then here is the third

494
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:13,250
one that I want to read the headline -

495
00:16:11,419 --> 00:16:15,259
it says denver issues this one was

496
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:16,759
written on November 18th once again by

497
00:16:15,259 --> 00:16:19,278
Ricardo Baca and David McCoy of the

498
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:22,129
cannabis it says denver issues ninth pot

499
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:24,289
product recall in ten weeks then the

500
00:16:22,129 --> 00:16:26,929
byline is edibles company guys garden

501
00:16:24,289 --> 00:16:29,208
issues its second voluntary recall in as

502
00:16:26,929 --> 00:16:32,568
many weeks after banned pesticides are

503
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:33,888
detected in products you guys this is an

504
00:16:32,568 --> 00:16:36,469
upsetting trend we've been seeing here

505
00:16:33,889 --> 00:16:39,198
in colorado in the commercial growing

506
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:43,100
industry I do not depends on your

507
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:45,679
perspective okay is it's I'd I really

508
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:48,528
hate that we're finding pesticides and

509
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:50,659
final product but I'm so thrilled that

510
00:16:48,528 --> 00:16:53,059
we're finding pesticides and final

511
00:16:50,659 --> 00:16:56,208
product like it's this weird duality yes

512
00:16:53,059 --> 00:16:58,189
this is regulation working this is when

513
00:16:56,208 --> 00:17:00,739
you you go to the store and you buy a

514
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:03,470
product you know there's not pesticides

515
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:05,779
in it and now that cannabis is legal

516
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:07,759
we're a year or so from having all of

517
00:17:05,779 --> 00:17:10,099
that testing in place so that you know

518
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:13,039
there's no bug [ __ ] there's no pesticide

519
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:14,928
there's no mold or mildew you're just

520
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:16,459
getting delicious concentrates so it

521
00:17:14,929 --> 00:17:18,048
sucks that they're fighting it's but

522
00:17:16,459 --> 00:17:19,699
it's awesome that they're finding it

523
00:17:18,048 --> 00:17:22,220
right because now we can stop it we can

524
00:17:19,699 --> 00:17:23,870
start teaching the growers and the grow

525
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:27,828
facilities have to stop using these

526
00:17:23,869 --> 00:17:29,239
products I much in the future I predict

527
00:17:27,828 --> 00:17:31,789
that the Department of Agriculture is

528
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:33,019
going to create a pesticide class for

529
00:17:31,789 --> 00:17:34,639
the cannabis industry they're gonna have

530
00:17:33,019 --> 00:17:35,779
to do it yep it's gonna have to happen

531
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,429
they're going to have to make their own

532
00:17:35,779 --> 00:17:38,658
regulations because that's who's doing

533
00:17:37,429 --> 00:17:40,809
this they're gonna have to tell us what

534
00:17:38,659 --> 00:17:43,460
we can and can't do they kind of are now

535
00:17:40,808 --> 00:17:46,039
all that stuff from the ground up like

536
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:47,900
it exists in every other industry but

537
00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:48,869
we're not allowed to access any of the

538
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,210
components that

539
00:17:48,869 --> 00:17:53,969
do this for like cantaloupe or tobacco

540
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:55,410
or right beer because cannabis is

541
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:57,240
federally illegal so we're not allowed

542
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:59,660
to federally test so no we can't find

543
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:02,519
all over labs that are doing the testing

544
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:05,308
were created by the demand the medical

545
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:06,808
industry created here like all of the

546
00:18:05,308 --> 00:18:08,789
labs that are up and running around the

547
00:18:06,808 --> 00:18:11,039
state came from the Medical Marijuana

548
00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:13,769
days and they weren't state mandated the

549
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:16,259
industry demanded them and created them

550
00:18:13,769 --> 00:18:18,359
on their own and when they do testing

551
00:18:16,259 --> 00:18:20,849
labs want to apply for DEA licensing

552
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:22,799
like they should they all got raided so

553
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:26,009
they stopped applying for DEA licensing

554
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:27,440
and just ran a testing lab anyway with

555
00:18:26,009 --> 00:18:30,240
just without that federal certification

556
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:32,009
meaning that they can't do like organics

557
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,720
testing or certifying or anything like

558
00:18:32,009 --> 00:18:35,789
that because that's all federal right

559
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:37,200
shot at this detail halen Labs yep

560
00:18:35,789 --> 00:18:39,450
actually I don't think organic testing

561
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,730
is actually federal I've been

562
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:43,860
regulations for using that word are okay

563
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:45,569
that makes sense recently if you're a

564
00:18:43,859 --> 00:18:47,359
legal marijuana business and you had

565
00:18:45,569 --> 00:18:53,189
organics in your name you had to change

566
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:54,899
a little bit yep what you guys gonna do

567
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:57,120
alright so let's talk about this article

568
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:58,620
a little bit you guys it seems to be a

569
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:00,058
trend in Colorado that a lot of the

570
00:18:58,619 --> 00:19:03,329
commercial growers are using pesticides

571
00:19:00,058 --> 00:19:05,399
that have been banned and that sounds

572
00:19:03,329 --> 00:19:07,710
ridiculous but oftentimes these products

573
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:09,809
were sprayed on the plants 70 days ago

574
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:11,940
and these rules came into effect 20 days

575
00:19:09,808 --> 00:19:13,678
ago so you can't retroactively lis

576
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:15,509
unsprayed your plants you can't go back

577
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:17,700
and that's basically what we're seeing

578
00:19:15,509 --> 00:19:20,250
plants that were harvested six months

579
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:21,720
ago and turned into other Earth's sold

580
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:23,849
off and turned into other products like

581
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:25,289
edibles and concentrates you know I

582
00:19:23,849 --> 00:19:27,928
didn't come in two more months ago I

583
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:29,579
didn't account for the time from so

584
00:19:27,929 --> 00:19:31,320
you've got to grow these plant they got

585
00:19:29,579 --> 00:19:33,899
a veg they've got to flower you're

586
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:35,069
looking at 90 to 120 days there it's got

587
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:36,600
to be harvested they've got to be

588
00:19:35,069 --> 00:19:38,599
trimmed and dried and cured you're

589
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:41,730
looking another two weeks there is your

590
00:19:38,599 --> 00:19:43,558
140 days ish somewhere between 120 and a

591
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:46,380
hundred and fifty days by now yep right

592
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:48,869
that's engineer math right and then the

593
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:50,970
product has to be picked up by the

594
00:19:48,869 --> 00:19:52,199
infusion company the mips whoever's

595
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:54,089
gonna turn it into something the

596
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,500
processing facility like it I mean then

597
00:19:54,089 --> 00:19:57,119
you've got drying and curing too so

598
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:59,490
that's what that's what got us to about

599
00:19:57,119 --> 00:20:02,009
150 but like yeah we're still rolling on

600
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:05,309
almost 200 days for

601
00:20:02,009 --> 00:20:08,579
today's 250 - yeah before it's even

602
00:20:05,309 --> 00:20:11,009
processed okay but I mean it wasn't

603
00:20:08,579 --> 00:20:14,579
standard practice for the company buying

604
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:16,170
the product - lab test it again right

605
00:20:14,579 --> 00:20:18,269
and that's one of the things that these

606
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:20,940
recalls are starting to create is the

607
00:20:18,269 --> 00:20:22,829
first company to really fail that was

608
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:24,390
the first big policy change they

609
00:20:22,829 --> 00:20:25,559
announced was we're gonna test

610
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:27,720
everything that comes in now because

611
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:31,559
that's how this happened yeah they

612
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:35,009
process really nasty stuff and we

613
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:38,369
probably dab some of it it could happen

614
00:20:35,009 --> 00:20:40,140
and you guys a lot of people did none of

615
00:20:38,369 --> 00:20:41,459
these recalls have been issued because

616
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:43,800
people got sick or anything like that

617
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:46,079
it's right industry-wide they're all

618
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:47,519
voluntary when they're going through and

619
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:49,230
doing lab testing when one of their

620
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:51,000
products fails they just do a massive

621
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:52,440
recall on anything with that serial

622
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,759
number which is admirable because that's

623
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:56,309
a lot of money that these guys are

624
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:57,960
losing that's tons of money tons of

625
00:20:56,309 --> 00:21:00,179
money I just measured money and weight

626
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:01,890
tons of money yes dollar amounts and

627
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:05,039
weight so these plants could have been

628
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:06,930
sprayed 200 days ago and these rules

629
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:09,750
just were put into effect whenever 30

630
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:11,130
days ago 45 days ago and so it's not

631
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:12,539
like people are [ __ ] up on purpose

632
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:14,640
it's not like it's ignorance it's just

633
00:21:12,539 --> 00:21:17,129
it's just timing of laws in a lot of the

634
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:19,650
places something that I want to mention

635
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:21,960
is all that we do used to smoke back in

636
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:23,550
the day before we had dispensaries it

637
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:25,110
was being sprayed with some [ __ ] there

638
00:21:23,549 --> 00:21:26,730
was something at worse than what's

639
00:21:25,109 --> 00:21:28,409
happening in these dispensaries on your

640
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:30,390
weed you've smoked it before it's

641
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:32,880
quality control is one of the first

642
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:35,100
things legal marijuana created as a side

643
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:37,410
industry and it's been a beautiful thing

644
00:21:35,099 --> 00:21:41,219
you know I saw a quality go when medical

645
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:43,320
came real popular around 2010 quality

646
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:45,569
skyrocketed yep there was a huge

647
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:49,589
competition for quality buds and then

648
00:21:45,569 --> 00:21:51,149
around 2013 2014 the quality started

649
00:21:49,589 --> 00:21:52,829
going away and the quantity started

650
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:55,380
popping up now everything looks the same

651
00:21:52,829 --> 00:21:58,529
everything looks real similar yep I'm

652
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:59,610
gonna try to uh to make that different

653
00:21:58,529 --> 00:22:01,619
in a green and healthy wellness we've

654
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:03,299
got some fun we got we got fire genetics

655
00:22:01,619 --> 00:22:04,979
and I know how to grow so I'm gonna try

656
00:22:03,299 --> 00:22:06,599
to bring that quality back to the Shelf

657
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:08,610
cream and healthy wellness I can't wait

658
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:09,929
yeah I keep looking back at the

659
00:22:08,609 --> 00:22:11,459
recording software to make sure we're

660
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:12,750
getting what we're saying because we

661
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:14,160
can't afford to try to do this all over

662
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:15,779
again that was weird right

663
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,200
alright so we're talking a lot about

664
00:22:15,779 --> 00:22:17,759
these

665
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:20,100
tainted products this brings me to an

666
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:21,089
email or an email a news article I wish

667
00:22:20,099 --> 00:22:24,480
there was an email that would've been

668
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:26,278
great this one Mike sent this to me from

669
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,079
The Denver Post right on Mike for

670
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:30,450
finding us the good news the headline is

671
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:32,398
Hickenlooper issues executive order to

672
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:34,980
declare a tainted pot a threat to the

673
00:22:32,398 --> 00:22:36,629
public the byline is any marijuana grown

674
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:40,200
with unapproved pesticides would be

675
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:41,669
removed from commerce and destroyed once

676
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,889
again the articles from David McGowan

677
00:22:41,669 --> 00:22:45,179
and Ricardo Baca and it goes a little

678
00:22:43,888 --> 00:22:46,619
bit like this I need to take a drink

679
00:22:45,179 --> 00:22:47,700
because I am dried up then I'll read you

680
00:22:46,619 --> 00:22:51,798
the article Mike say something

681
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:54,298
impressive oh okay basically this story

682
00:22:51,798 --> 00:22:57,418
just to save Jeff the effort of reading

683
00:22:54,298 --> 00:22:59,759
a long letter from the governor any

684
00:22:57,419 --> 00:23:02,309
marijuana grown with an unapproved

685
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:06,119
pesticide is now a threat to public

686
00:23:02,308 --> 00:23:09,538
safety just sort of by default so any

687
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:11,969
but any grow that's got a not unapproved

688
00:23:09,538 --> 00:23:14,849
pesticide use going on and that grow is

689
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:18,419
currently scrambling to figure out new

690
00:23:14,849 --> 00:23:20,808
pest management protocols because the

691
00:23:18,419 --> 00:23:24,360
rule in this that's gonna really throw

692
00:23:20,808 --> 00:23:26,908
shockwaves through the industry is right

693
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:28,949
now cannabis is federally illegal and to

694
00:23:26,909 --> 00:23:31,110
sell a pesticide in the United States

695
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:33,778
you need a federal certification and

696
00:23:31,109 --> 00:23:36,990
approval I mean your product has to be

697
00:23:33,778 --> 00:23:38,819
tested for all kinds of stuff because

698
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:42,388
it's being sprayed I'm God knows what

699
00:23:38,819 --> 00:23:43,950
around God knows who so it every

700
00:23:42,388 --> 00:23:45,719
pesticide comes with a lot of really

701
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:47,190
specific rules about how they can and

702
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:50,579
can't be used and what they can and

703
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:53,759
can't be used on and cannabis right now

704
00:23:50,579 --> 00:23:56,158
isn't on any of those labels and what

705
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:58,138
the governor just said was if cannabis

706
00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:01,289
isn't on the label specifically you

707
00:23:58,138 --> 00:24:03,148
can't use it to grow marijuana legally

708
00:24:01,288 --> 00:24:05,609
in Colorado and nobody's gonna put

709
00:24:03,148 --> 00:24:08,459
marijuana on there or cannabis or they

710
00:24:05,609 --> 00:24:11,788
got just because it's illegal yeah there

711
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:15,389
is a caveat there's some some pesticides

712
00:24:11,788 --> 00:24:17,129
have they're super safe you can use them

713
00:24:15,388 --> 00:24:19,138
on anything and they have it a

714
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:21,419
standardized phrase for that that'll be

715
00:24:19,138 --> 00:24:24,928
on the label and if the pesticide

716
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:27,389
carries that specific use designation

717
00:24:24,929 --> 00:24:29,130
then it can be used on cannabis so it's

718
00:24:27,388 --> 00:24:32,009
not like we can't use anything

719
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:34,500
in this industry but I guarantee there

720
00:24:32,009 --> 00:24:37,019
are countless grows around Colorado that

721
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:39,539
have been using stuff that's perfectly

722
00:24:37,019 --> 00:24:43,769
acceptable for tobacco or flowers or

723
00:24:39,539 --> 00:24:45,690
food and has been used on cannabis for a

724
00:24:43,769 --> 00:24:47,670
decade or more around the country

725
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:49,740
everywhere just as common practice right

726
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:50,789
that are scrambling right now to figure

727
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:52,799
out what they're gonna replace that

728
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:54,569
product with it's gonna make a huge

729
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:56,460
difference for a lot of growers so

730
00:24:54,569 --> 00:24:58,169
there's a timeline here and I will read

731
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:59,190
part of the article you guys I might try

732
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:00,870
to sum it up for us but I'll read a

733
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:02,039
bunch of it there's a timeline off to

734
00:25:00,869 --> 00:25:03,329
the right of the artist a lot that's

735
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:04,649
what I was thinking about thank you

736
00:25:03,329 --> 00:25:06,750
thank you I needed a little bit of

737
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:08,460
hydration so that helped out there's a

738
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:10,670
timeline here and it says on September

739
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:14,190
7th months after marijuana holds post

740
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:16,769
post tests find pesticides in products

741
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:19,590
and that was on September 7th September

742
00:25:16,769 --> 00:25:21,269
8th Denver recalls mahatma pot extracts

743
00:25:19,589 --> 00:25:23,250
containing unapproved pesticides and

744
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:26,789
then on the 18th denver issues two more

745
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:29,190
recalls and it keeps going ah let's see

746
00:25:26,789 --> 00:25:30,420
colorado proposes stricter rules pot

747
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:34,549
products made with unapproved pesticides

748
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:36,750
recalled on October 18th Colorado puts

749
00:25:34,549 --> 00:25:39,240
what that's not a real word

750
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:40,859
it's just abbreviated stuff on industry

751
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:43,079
to use pesticides that are safe on pot

752
00:25:40,859 --> 00:25:44,669
and then on the 21st Nature's Cure of

753
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:46,079
Denver recalls pop products containing

754
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:47,730
pesticides then it just keeps going you

755
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:49,319
guys so there are a bunch of incidents

756
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:50,970
of these pesticides on cannabis we're

757
00:25:49,319 --> 00:25:52,409
gonna keep seeing it and then they think

758
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:52,890
it'll taper off in the middle of next

759
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:55,019
year

760
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:56,910
it should by summer of next year by

761
00:25:55,019 --> 00:25:58,079
spring of next year all this [ __ ] should

762
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:59,759
be settled everybody should be

763
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:01,699
well-educated on what they can and can't

764
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:04,710
use all the tainted herbs should be gone

765
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:07,230
some of the problem here is we don't

766
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:09,090
have enough testing labs so if you're

767
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:14,460
looking to invest in a fun sized but

768

00:26:26,819 --> 00:26:31,230
testing reliable potency testing yep we

776
00:26:29,549 --> 00:26:32,369
need it all alright let's read part of

777
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:34,410
the article I know Mike tried to sum it

778
00:26:32,369 --> 00:26:36,569
up but it goes like this

779
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:38,190
Governor John Hickenlooper on Thursday

780
00:26:36,569 --> 00:26:39,899
issued an executive order telling state

781
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:41,549
agencies that any marijuana grown with

782
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:42,820
unapproved pesticides is a threat to

783
00:26:41,549 --> 00:26:45,038
public safety and should be

784
00:26:42,819 --> 00:26:46,990
moved from commerce and destroyed the

785
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:49,179
order is hickenlooper x' first word on a

786
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:51,940
months old controversy over pesticide

787
00:26:49,179 --> 00:26:54,370
used to grow cannabis and a more

788
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:56,080
aggressive approach to then half a dozen

789
00:26:54,369 --> 00:26:57,849
recalls by denver health officials have

790
00:26:56,079 --> 00:27:00,879
put on thousands of contaminated

791
00:26:57,849 --> 00:27:02,349
products some of it later allowed back

792
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,580
into commerce sorry you guys that was

793
00:27:02,349 --> 00:27:05,528
hard to read there's a really long

794
00:27:03,579 --> 00:27:06,879
sentence that whole paragraph is one

795
00:27:05,528 --> 00:27:14,619
sentence and i didn't have a good rythm

796
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:16,299
sorry I made it walking for you the tech

797
00:27:14,619 --> 00:27:17,979
issues are the dad's after but it

798
00:27:16,298 --> 00:27:20,769
definitely [ __ ] with my rhythm little

799
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:22,269
from column a that's the truth the

800
00:27:20,769 --> 00:27:24,548
article goes on to say the order

801
00:27:22,269 --> 00:27:25,960
effectively immediately was the result

802
00:27:24,548 --> 00:27:28,480
of a collaboration with officials from

803
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:30,340
several state agencies the Department of

804
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,500
Agriculture Revenue and Public Health

805
00:27:30,339 --> 00:27:35,019
and Environment among them and provides

806
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:36,579
much-needed clarity on the use of pet

807
00:27:35,019 --> 00:27:38,528
use of pesticides and how agencies

808
00:27:36,579 --> 00:27:40,418
should treat them according to a joint

809
00:27:38,528 --> 00:27:43,808
announcement a joint announcement right

810
00:27:40,419 --> 00:27:45,278
haha it says when the pesticide is

811
00:27:43,808 --> 00:27:47,019
applied to a crop in a manner that is

812
00:27:45,278 --> 00:27:48,878
inconsistent with the pesticides label

813
00:27:47,019 --> 00:27:51,099
and the crop is contaminated by that

814
00:27:48,878 --> 00:27:53,619
pesticide it constitutes a threat to

815
00:27:51,099 --> 00:27:56,500
public safety the order says the order

816
00:27:53,619 --> 00:27:58,359
says agencies agencies should use all

817
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:00,190
investigative and enforcement authority

818
00:27:58,359 --> 00:28:02,019
to end the threat including but not

819
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:03,970
limited to placing contaminated

820
00:28:02,019 --> 00:28:05,829
marijuana on administrative hold and

821
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:08,379
destroying contaminated marijuana

822
00:28:05,829 --> 00:28:11,378
pursuant to existing law industry

823
00:28:08,378 --> 00:28:13,209
spokespersons spokespersons got my words

824
00:28:11,378 --> 00:28:14,678
are hard industry spokespersons could

825
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:16,360
not be immediately reached for comment

826
00:28:14,679 --> 00:28:17,919
late Thursday the order comes from

827
00:28:16,359 --> 00:28:19,658
Denver Post stories that showed how

828
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:21,250
potentially harmful pesticides barred

829
00:28:19,659 --> 00:28:22,899
for use on cannabis we're still being

830
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:25,329
applied and fought at high

831
00:28:22,898 --> 00:28:27,939
concentrations in products sold to

832
00:28:25,329 --> 00:28:30,509
customers if the Denver Post is taking

833
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:32,440
full credit for this executive order

834
00:28:30,509 --> 00:28:32,860
that's what yeah that's what that

835
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,899
sounded like

836
00:28:32,859 --> 00:28:36,729
thanks for point a pers love it when

837
00:28:34,898 --> 00:28:38,349
they can say we reported something and

838
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:40,298
then change happened at a state level

839
00:28:38,349 --> 00:28:41,408
because of it and so this is a huge

840
00:28:40,298 --> 00:28:44,319
feather in their cap

841
00:28:41,409 --> 00:28:46,059
they've just been buying up random

842
00:28:44,319 --> 00:28:47,528
product to dispensaries and taking it to

843
00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:49,418
testing labs who's gonna say that the

844
00:28:47,528 --> 00:28:51,460
westward started that part of it they

845
00:28:49,419 --> 00:28:54,009
the westward in the Denver Post both

846
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:55,309
hammered the edibles industry a couple

847
00:28:54,009 --> 00:28:58,039
of years ago

848
00:28:55,309 --> 00:28:59,839
over potency issues and then they

849
00:28:58,039 --> 00:29:01,819
started doing contaminants tests or the

850
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:04,069
poster - doing contaminants testing and

851
00:29:01,819 --> 00:29:05,450
it's definitely sent shockwaves through

852
00:29:04,069 --> 00:29:07,789
the industry it's definitely caused

853
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:09,440
change to state level so they're running

854
00:29:07,789 --> 00:29:12,500
around like they scored because they

855
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:14,390
[ __ ] scored and they kind of did um

856
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:16,099
and it's been a good smack for the legal

857
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:21,680
industry I think like there was a little

858
00:29:16,099 --> 00:29:23,719
bit of shenanigans like we brought a lot

859
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:26,720
of the black market stuff with us and

860
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:28,130
eventually we were gonna step up enough

861
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,440
to where we had to play by the same

862
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:31,910
rules everybody else did and we've

863
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:35,660
passed that point in Colorado now

864
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:37,820
significantly and so a lot of the things

865
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:39,170
that happen at every employer now could

866
00:29:37,819 --> 00:29:42,710
be happening throughout the marijuana

867
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:45,500
industry and some of that lab testing

868
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:47,930
some of that's recalls and it's about

869
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:49,190
time it happened it is it is alright

870
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:52,160
I'll keep going with the article it says

871
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:53,330
where was I I wanted to give a shout out

872
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,920
to Claude the Candyman we're talking

873
00:29:53,329 --> 00:29:56,569
about edibles shots - Claude the

874
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:58,130
Candyman dude you're on an adventure of

875
00:29:56,569 --> 00:30:00,980
a lifetime you're probably not gonna

876
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:03,770
hear this podcast but uh Claude is

877
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:05,750
taking a personal vacation and I've seen

878
00:30:03,769 --> 00:30:08,240
his facebook pictures the dude has never

879
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:09,980
had a bigger smile he's making a life

880
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,960
change and Claude a proud Ebro big shout

881
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:13,910
out support sweet stone candy that's

882
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:16,009
what made me think he needs a shout-out

883
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:17,720
on the show so it goes on to say the

884
00:30:16,009 --> 00:30:19,549
post also identified how state laws that

885
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,900
barred use of certain pesticides were

886
00:30:19,549 --> 00:30:22,700
not enforced and the testing

887
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:25,670
requirements for pesticide residues were

888
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:26,360
set aside and then it says a threat to

889
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:28,370
safety

890
00:30:26,359 --> 00:30:30,349
Thursday's bulletin specifically

891
00:30:28,369 --> 00:30:32,839
mandates state agencies to determine any

892
00:30:30,349 --> 00:30:35,149
off-label use of a pesticides a threat

893
00:30:32,839 --> 00:30:36,679
to public safety and ensure that the

894
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:39,740
contaminated products are quarantined

895
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:41,600
and destroyed oh that's a bunch of hash

896
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:43,640
and pot you're just gonna watch it just

897
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:46,879
destroyed I'm wondering how high the

898
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:48,170
animals to landfilling Amanda I think

899
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,240
you just gonna burn it like back in the

900
00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:51,590
day the fire department used to just put

901
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,569
all the bales of weed in the fire they

902
00:30:51,589 --> 00:30:54,889
still do that all over the place and

903
00:30:53,569 --> 00:30:57,409
every now and then they [ __ ] it up and

904
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:59,690
get the whole town really high yeah but

905
00:30:57,410 --> 00:31:01,610
I don't know maybe I think it's just

906
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:03,559
gonna get blended with dirt is what it's

907
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:05,689
probably gonna happens with it that's

908
00:31:03,559 --> 00:31:07,220
kind of what happens at a dispensary if

909
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:08,210
you run a soil grow and you got to throw

910
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:10,130
leaves away

911
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:12,920
you do like lasagna you do leaves dirt

912
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:13,130
leaves dirt just mash it up yep all

913
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,509
right

914
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:15,890
the article goes on to say Thursday's

915
00:31:14,509 --> 00:31:18,259
bulletin specifically meant in a way I

916
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:19,580
just read that part that is that is a

917
00:31:18,259 --> 00:31:21,230
stiffer approach in the quantity

918
00:31:19,579 --> 00:31:22,759
quarantines and recalls Denver health

919
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:24,079
officials have put on marijuana products

920
00:31:22,759 --> 00:31:26,450
contaminated with unapproved pesticides

921
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:28,189
in most cases the products were allowed

922
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:30,319
back into commerce once tests confirmed

923
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:32,450
pesticide residues were at levels lower

924
00:31:30,319 --> 00:31:35,119
than what's allowed on other consumable

925
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:36,740
crops Hickenlooper zorder appears to

926
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:38,449
leave no room for trace amounts and

927
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:40,339
recalls for the destruction of the

928
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:44,509
affected plants and any derivative

929
00:31:40,339 --> 00:31:46,579
products zero no trace elements so if

930
00:31:44,509 --> 00:31:48,349
they used any pesticide they find it on

931
00:31:46,579 --> 00:31:50,899
there pretty much bye-bye to your whole

932
00:31:48,349 --> 00:31:53,990
product line if they use some of this

933
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:57,440
stuff I mean years ago they could be

934
00:31:53,990 --> 00:32:00,109
destroying breeding stock or I mean how

935
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:03,049
many this is most of the recalls are

936
00:32:00,109 --> 00:32:06,229
stem from a couple of bigger grows that

937
00:32:03,049 --> 00:32:08,299
wholesale off dried flower to other

938
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:10,849
companies to make edibles or hash with

939
00:32:08,299 --> 00:32:12,529
and so that's it's the people that

940
00:32:10,849 --> 00:32:14,689
bought it that are now issuing recalls

941
00:32:12,529 --> 00:32:17,779
is they go through and they're like wait

942
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:19,759
[ __ ] we bought 80 pounds of that and we

943
00:32:17,779 --> 00:32:21,859
make chocolate bars so we threw that 80

944
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:23,509
pounds in with a thousand other pounds

945
00:32:21,859 --> 00:32:25,789
we bought and we made butter out of that

946
00:32:23,509 --> 00:32:27,529
and then we've made edibles and now

947
00:32:25,789 --> 00:32:29,180
we've got to recall all the edible

948
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:31,190
batches with those serial numbers on

949
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:33,259
those it's huge ripples through the

950
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:35,029
industry ouch we're gonna see lab

951
00:32:33,259 --> 00:32:37,549
testing at every level we're gonna see

952
00:32:35,029 --> 00:32:39,410
the labs triple or quadruple the number

953
00:32:37,549 --> 00:32:40,849
across the state to handle all the

954
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:44,990
testing that's gonna have to take place

955
00:32:40,849 --> 00:32:47,959
I wouldn't be surprised to see little

956
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:50,870
spike in price of a buck or two for

957
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:53,120
whatever price all this [ __ ] cost

958
00:32:50,869 --> 00:32:56,599
because yeah it's gonna play into a bit

959
00:32:53,119 --> 00:32:59,179
more crime I'm happy to buy stuff in the

960
00:32:56,599 --> 00:33:01,129
legal industry because I know that this

961
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:02,600
stuff's coming out yeah yeah I don't

962
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:04,790
have to worry about what's being sprayed

963
00:33:02,599 --> 00:33:06,230
on over what's still in it man you just

964
00:33:04,789 --> 00:33:10,009
made the greatest argument for legal

965
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:17,240
prostitution yep yep that applies yeah I

966
00:33:10,009 --> 00:33:18,369
didn't just study legalizing weed and

967
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,900
clean than it's

968
00:33:18,369 --> 00:33:21,939
better than getting some dirty hookers

969
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:24,190
all right we've gotten sidetracked I'm

970
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:25,690
gonna continue the article here it goes

971
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:27,430
on to say a company could destroy any

972
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:29,320
affected marijuana voluntarily or face

973
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:30,789
administrative actions by the state to

974
00:33:29,319 --> 00:33:32,439
force the destruction according to a

975
00:33:30,789 --> 00:33:35,500
policy statement issued by the Chiefs of

976
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:37,420
the three state agencies involved there

977
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:39,069
is no pesticide specifically approved

978
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:40,300
for use on marijuana because the

979
00:33:39,069 --> 00:33:42,129
chemicals are regulated by the US

980
00:33:40,299 --> 00:33:44,889
Environmental Protection Agency and

981
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:46,809
cannabis is illegal under federal law as

982
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:48,490
a result there have been no tests to

983
00:33:46,808 --> 00:33:50,529
show how pesticides used on marijuana

984
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:53,980
could affect consumers or whether their

985
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:55,569
use is safe but state agricultural

986
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:57,460
officials have allowed certain

987
00:33:55,569 --> 00:33:59,169
pesticides to be used on marijuana crops

988
00:33:57,460 --> 00:34:01,240
only if it would not violate the

989
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:02,380
restriction on the products label it is

990
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:04,660
a violation of federal law

991
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:06,220
to use a pesticide contrary to its label

992
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:07,570
you guys this applies to you and your

993
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:10,599
home Gro this applies to you and your

994
00:34:07,569 --> 00:34:13,090
greenhouse grow any pesticide wants to

995
00:34:10,599 --> 00:34:14,589
be a dick it can be an extra charge yep

996
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:17,530
yep all you got to do when you buy your

997
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:18,820
your spray products your pesticides peel

998
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:20,679
off that little booklet that's on the

999
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:23,230
back and read it there will be rules on

1000
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:25,480
there there will be what you should

1001
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:28,269
really pay attention to is the interval

1002
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:30,070
of reentry if it says not to go in this

1003
00:34:28,269 --> 00:34:31,418
braid area for 4 hours you should

1004
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:33,700
probably stay out of there for 4 hours

1005
00:34:31,418 --> 00:34:34,898
take that seriously you're not gonna

1006
00:34:33,699 --> 00:34:36,428
notice that you're getting sick from a

1007
00:34:34,898 --> 00:34:37,089
pesticide until you start twitching in

1008
00:34:36,429 --> 00:34:39,398
five years

1009
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:42,760
right like you really want to read those

1010
00:34:39,398 --> 00:34:44,559
labels yeah so where the heck was I

1011
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:46,030
despite the prohibitions the Post

1012
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:48,009
revealed in its own testing that a

1013
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:50,080
number of marijuana infused products

1014
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:52,659
contained high levels of pesticides not

1015
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:54,340
allowed for use on cannabis what

1016
00:34:52,659 --> 00:34:55,360
followed were a number of recalls issued

1017
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:56,710
by the Denver Department of

1018
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:58,570
Environmental Health after

1019
00:34:56,710 --> 00:35:01,210
investigations into business is

1020
00:34:58,570 --> 00:35:02,470
connected with the Post's findings we

1021
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:04,269
were at the last paragraph you guys go

1022
00:35:02,469 --> 00:35:06,219
ahead Mike it's a downplay the other

1023
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:08,170
half of their findings they found they

1024
00:35:06,219 --> 00:35:10,779
tested eight samples two of them came

1025
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:13,960
back pretty dirty but the other six came

1026
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:17,170
back cleaner than the lab testing dude

1027
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:19,929
had seen anything in a while nice so but

1028
00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:22,180
that's not news well it should be it

1029
00:35:19,929 --> 00:35:23,859
should be but there's no scare tactic

1030
00:35:22,179 --> 00:35:26,230
involved in that right like it's it's

1031
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:28,210
really unfortunate that the there's a

1032
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:30,010
dirty product out on store shelves but

1033
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:31,050
at the same time it's all being recalled

1034
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:34,320
because we've got

1035
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:36,120
labs no one else has it's kind of a

1036
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:39,390
beautiful thing I'm such a [ __ ] up way

1037
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:42,230
though all right you guys I will try I'm

1038
00:35:39,389 --> 00:35:45,269
gonna make myself a note a list of

1039
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:46,650
approved all right I want to find a list

1040
00:35:45,269 --> 00:35:47,880
of approved pesticides which I need

1041
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:49,530
anyway for the shop

1042
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:51,030
we just need we use basically one or two

1043
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:52,680
products at the shop we've got a pretty

1044
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:54,780
good pesticide regimen going on there

1045
00:35:52,679 --> 00:35:56,250
but uh I will get a list of approved

1046
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:58,610
pesticides we'll talk about that on the

1047
00:35:56,250 --> 00:36:01,949
show when we do the pest management

1048
00:35:58,610 --> 00:36:02,940
episode that I need to work on I've got

1049
00:36:01,949 --> 00:36:04,439
a lot of episodes of like halfway

1050
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:06,240
written you guys I just need to put them

1051
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:08,579
together things have been really chaotic

1052
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:10,049
in my world I've been driving the

1053
00:36:08,579 --> 00:36:11,460
springs like three times a week to talk

1054
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:13,380
about getting a job and now I've got the

1055
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:15,119
job so it's gonna be a lot of fun let's

1056
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:16,950
get on to the last paragraph of this

1057
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:18,179
news article so that we can get Mike

1058
00:36:16,949 --> 00:36:20,429
home to his little baby

1059
00:36:18,179 --> 00:36:22,199
it says although state officials have

1060
00:36:20,429 --> 00:36:23,219
been battling around pesticide rules for

1061
00:36:22,199 --> 00:36:24,419
more than a year there was no

1062
00:36:23,219 --> 00:36:26,069
enforcement until Denver health

1063
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:28,200
officials quarantined more than a

1064
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:30,360
hundred thousand plants it said were

1065
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:32,849
improperly grown with pesticides the

1066
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:34,320
state said could not be used the

1067
00:36:32,849 --> 00:36:35,759
quarantines came after Denver fire

1068
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,440
inspectors found potentially hazardous

1069
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,820
pesticides and marijuana growing

1070
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,980
facilities during routine inspections

1071
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:42,809
this year and reported it to health

1072
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:45,840
officials because I mentioned this on

1073
00:36:42,809 --> 00:36:48,090
the show they found a eagle 20 in there

1074
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:50,519
and when Eagle 20 is an eagle 20 or

1075
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:52,559
might its Eagle 20 when Eagle 20 catches

1076
00:36:50,519 --> 00:36:55,230
on fire and burns the off gas that comes

1077
00:36:52,559 --> 00:36:56,969
from Eagle 20 is cyanide so that's when

1078
00:36:55,230 --> 00:37:02,940
the firemen Fire Department doesn't want

1079
00:36:56,969 --> 00:37:04,679
that in your grow because people yeah

1080
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:06,809
like know what you've got in your grow

1081
00:37:04,679 --> 00:37:08,069
know you've got in your house this is

1082
00:37:06,809 --> 00:37:09,719
all gonna do Long's

1083
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:11,309
yeah you should read the label on any

1084
00:37:09,719 --> 00:37:12,569
product you're using any way all the

1085
00:37:11,309 --> 00:37:13,829
time you should kind of be aware of what

1086
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:15,660
you're putting into yourself and your

1087
00:37:13,829 --> 00:37:18,989
plants into your food feeding your dog

1088
00:37:15,659 --> 00:37:21,299
read the label alright last paragraph

1089
00:37:18,989 --> 00:37:23,099
you guys last small sentence in the

1090
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:24,960
paragraph the state isn't in rulemaking

1091
00:37:23,099 --> 00:37:27,089
that would strictly limit the pesticides

1092
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,920
that can be used on marijuana only to

1093
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:31,019
those whose labels allow for unspecified

1094
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:33,000
crops that can be used in greenhouses

1095
00:37:31,019 --> 00:37:35,159
and that are not prohibited from human

1096
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,530
consumption pesticides allowed in

1097
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:42,269
tobacco cultivation also would be

1098
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:44,220
approved alright so any pesticides found

1099
00:37:42,269 --> 00:37:45,000
in any test of cannabis equals your

1100
00:37:44,219 --> 00:37:48,299
cannabis is

1101
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:50,369
being destroyed yep that's a huge move

1102
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:52,349
that's Mike said it a minute ago it's

1103
00:37:50,369 --> 00:37:54,030
gonna make prices go up if the I mean

1104
00:37:52,349 --> 00:37:56,849
it's gonna send big ripples through the

1105
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:58,440
industry there's not everybody was

1106
00:37:56,849 --> 00:38:00,330
growing with the stuff that's being

1107
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:03,570
banned or was banned a couple months

1108
00:38:00,329 --> 00:38:06,598
back so it's not like everyone has to

1109
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:09,539
change up but every company that buys

1110
00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:12,180
product does like it's it's only a

1111
00:38:09,539 --> 00:38:14,909
matter of time before shops our lab

1112
00:38:12,179 --> 00:38:18,539
testing everything that comes in just as

1113
00:38:14,909 --> 00:38:20,819
a matter of policy let alone extract

1114
00:38:18,539 --> 00:38:22,108
companies edible companies just think of

1115
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:23,430
a product like chief would chew or dick

1116
00:38:22,108 --> 00:38:25,199
ceilings he came to the new Snoop Dogg

1117
00:38:23,429 --> 00:38:26,969
you know how much stuff they buy and

1118
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:28,529
process right or snoops new line or

1119
00:38:26,969 --> 00:38:30,358
Rihanna's new I know like there's

1120
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:32,040
freaking every honest new line yep

1121
00:38:30,358 --> 00:38:33,630
wooden I thought might have just been a

1122
00:38:32,039 --> 00:38:34,920
meme on Facebook I don't know I'm high

1123

wait till this process is over so I can

1176
00:40:36,039 --> 00:40:41,469
finally get some details because all

1177
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:45,700
I've seen is three jar samples flashed

1178
00:40:41,469 --> 00:40:47,319
in front of my grandpa's and some jar

1179
00:40:45,699 --> 00:40:48,969
samples is pretty much what I've what

1180
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:50,590
I've shown anybody right and I want to

1181
00:40:48,969 --> 00:40:52,299
dig through all of those jars there's a

1182
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:54,700
whole bunch of them over there there are

1183
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:56,620
ten if it made it to the final round for

1184
00:40:54,699 --> 00:40:58,000
damsel to choose from so whichever one

1185
00:40:56,619 --> 00:41:01,269
of those tins she likes the best

1186
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,889
we will work with she's human and she

1187
00:41:01,269 --> 00:41:04,630
may reject all ten of them that may not

1188
00:41:02,889 --> 00:41:06,579
be what she wants so when this might

1189
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:08,349
just be round one yeah exactly

1190

lately shit's been blowing up lately

1307
00:45:13,530 --> 00:45:18,060
because anti-pop people have taken

1308
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:19,890
notice and are starting to get really

1309
00:45:18,059 --> 00:45:22,889
pissed when I link their stuff and

1310
00:45:19,889 --> 00:45:26,159
debunk it and it's led to some really

1311
00:45:22,889 --> 00:45:29,039
hilarious little prohibitionist I don't

1312
00:45:26,159 --> 00:45:30,960
know attempted trolling I supposed a way

1313
00:45:29,039 --> 00:45:33,989
to describe it it's it's funny cuz it's

1314
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:37,199
sort of like if a small child decided to

1315
00:45:33,989 --> 00:45:38,759
lecture calculus at you like it doesn't

1316
00:45:37,199 --> 00:45:41,309
matter how passionate they are like

1317
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:44,790
they're never gonna get it right you're

1318
00:45:41,309 --> 00:45:46,860
not gonna learn anything useful it's

1319
00:45:44,789 --> 00:45:48,900
just this weird thing that I mean to be

1320
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:51,599
against pot at this point in history is

1321
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:54,329
to have failed to do your homework

1322
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:57,329

1323
00:45:54,329 --> 00:46:00,539

even look at Facebook the past week I

1354
00:47:02,059 --> 00:47:07,110
find myself shunning news and social

1355
00:47:04,889 --> 00:47:09,299
media after events like this just

1356
00:47:07,110 --> 00:47:11,640
because of all that like the event

1357
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:13,410
itself is bad enough all the hate in the

1358
00:47:11,639 --> 00:47:15,239
fear and the idiocy and the ignorance

1359
00:47:13,409 --> 00:47:16,920
that led up to it's bad enough but then

1360
00:47:15,239 --> 00:47:19,709

much worse right yeah yeah Facebook just

1362
00:47:19,710 --> 00:47:22,500
