27
00:00:52,009 --> 00:00:56,670
we do like to start the podcast off by

28
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:59,039
talking about what we are smoking Mike

29
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:01,559
and I said we took a DAB for you just in

30
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,870
case you're curious that dab was banana

31
00:01:01,558 --> 00:01:06,950
Rama ambrosia from our friends at

32
00:01:03,869 --> 00:01:10,469
apothecary farms the potency label says

33
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:12,868
70.1% THC which is not a high number but

34
00:01:10,469 --> 00:01:16,259
I got lit from smoking it was going

35
00:01:12,868 --> 00:01:17,670
total cannabinoids 81% total

36
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:20,879
cannabinoids so there's got to be some

37
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:23,099
CBD or some THC V or some something

38
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:25,649
different in there something something I

39
00:01:23,099 --> 00:01:27,719
lost the thread Mike lost his train of

40
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:30,000
thought it's working so it is that's

41
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:31,798
with the Bananarama it's got a really

42
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,349
interesting aroma it does have to be

43
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:36,600
more more you dude you were you jumping

44
00:01:34,349 --> 00:01:37,890
right on it it's got a I said it tastes

45
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:39,478
like jell-o shots and I haven't had a

46
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:42,269
jello shot in a hundred years but it's

47
00:01:39,478 --> 00:01:45,030
got that uh the green jello not the band

48
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:47,609
but the snack it's got the green jello

49
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:49,829
sort of a flavor to it aroma a little

50
00:01:47,609 --> 00:01:51,239
bit I think so that lemon lime jello is

51
00:01:49,828 --> 00:01:53,009
sort of a thing big shout out to our

52
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:55,890
friends at apothecary farms for the

53
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:57,930
Bananarama ambrosia

54
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:00,390
all right podcast world I recently

55
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:02,850
discovered a new website that provides a

56
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:03,899
lot of information for me I'm not gonna

57
00:02:02,849 --> 00:02:05,309
tell you the name of the website might

58
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:06,989
include to me is if I may do my

59
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:09,179
advertising voice we're joking about it

60
00:02:06,989 --> 00:02:11,519
earlier not gonna happen not gonna do it

61
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:13,310
I did find a website where I can find a

62
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,830
lot of podcast review

63
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:17,900
a lot of statistics they want me to give

64
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:19,430
them money for some more stuff but the

65
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,870
free stuff is very useful there are a

66
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:23,959
lot of useful stats on there I can see

67
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:25,909
my rankings on stitcher and iTunes I can

68
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:28,640
see my favorite part what I'm getting at

69
00:02:25,909 --> 00:02:30,739
is all of the iTunes customer reviews

70
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:34,339
all of the stitcher reviews they are all

71
00:02:30,739 --> 00:02:36,409
compiled into one place one I did not

72
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:38,200
realize I think I knew it but I don't

73
00:02:36,409 --> 00:02:40,818
think I ever thought about it that

74
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:42,799
iTunes is broken down by country and

75
00:02:40,818 --> 00:02:44,359
there are folks in other countries that

76
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,310
have been leaving reviews on the podcast

77
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:48,200
which we are not able to discover

78
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:50,509
through we don't see through the

79
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:52,039
platform we access exactly because

80
00:02:50,509 --> 00:02:53,268
they've got a different library and a

81
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:54,650
different matter just a different

82
00:02:53,269 --> 00:02:55,010
algorithm and they're probably different

83
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:57,530
things

84
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:58,609
yeah differents different stuff I don't

85
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:00,680
need to worry about what all the

86
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:02,450
technical stuff is but my point is there

87
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:05,390
are other reviews which we have been

88
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:08,629
missing when you do that it's really

89
00:03:05,389 --> 00:03:10,279
creepy by the way your mic is so low

90
00:03:08,629 --> 00:03:12,650
that it comes weird yeah that is creepy

91
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:15,110
that we've found so there are more

92
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:16,789
reviews and I think that we need to take

93
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:19,100
a minute and read some of the reviews

94
00:03:16,789 --> 00:03:21,078
from some of our friends from other

95
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:23,930
places we should it may be

96
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:25,670
discriminatory if we didn't do so I'm

97
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:27,079
going to leave out speaking of

98
00:03:25,669 --> 00:03:29,869
discriminatory I'm going to leave out

99
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:31,760
the u.s. iTunes customer reviews because

100
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:33,980
they're easily accessible on the iTunes

101
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:36,108
which I normally find we're going to

102
00:03:33,979 --> 00:03:38,238
focus on our foreign friends for these

103
00:03:36,109 --> 00:03:39,709
next couple of reviews internationally

104
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,799
and then after we do a couple of reviews

105
00:03:39,709 --> 00:03:43,700
we are going to jump into some listener

106
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,379
emails

107
00:03:43,699 --> 00:03:47,689
couple of them all right let's jump

108
00:03:45,379 --> 00:03:51,560
right into it alright this review was

109
00:03:47,689 --> 00:03:53,900
left on May 9th and it goes a lot like

110
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,280
this they gave us a 5-star rating it

111
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:58,000
says it is the best I should mention

112
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:02,120
that this one was left by big bass on

113
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,889
Apple podcasts from Great Britain so the

114
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:06,379
comment goes I would highly recommend

115
00:04:03,889 --> 00:04:08,329
listening to this podcast even if you

116
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:10,989
are just remotely interested about

117
00:04:08,329 --> 00:04:13,219
cannabis that is the best source of

118
00:04:10,989 --> 00:04:15,620
convocation and then he said comedy and

119
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:17,509
education this is my review I can write

120
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:19,370
like that if I want and I appreciate

121
00:04:17,509 --> 00:04:21,560
that I like your creative writing he

122
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:23,509
goes on to say for cannabis I could

123
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,759
easily sit and listen to Rasta Geoff and

124
00:04:23,509 --> 00:04:26,430
the and of course white Mike for hours

125
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,829
which

126
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:30,209
have done they should be proud of what

127
00:04:28,829 --> 00:04:31,288
they have achieved here that Mike we

128
00:04:30,209 --> 00:04:33,388
should be a proud of what we have

129
00:04:31,288 --> 00:04:35,310
achieved and if this listener could only

130
00:04:33,389 --> 00:04:38,189
help with the progression of cannabis as

131
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:39,449
much as we have he would be a happy man

132
00:04:38,189 --> 00:04:41,639
hey that's cool man thank you I

133
00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:43,530

134

146
00:05:07,168 --> 00:05:12,750
Presley Presley boo from Apple podcasts

in Canada this was left on August 6 it

148
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:19,110
says one of my favorite podcasts top

149
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:21,508
tier sound quality and information that

150
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:24,120
is a great review I can stop there they

151
00:05:21,509 --> 00:05:26,160
like the top tier sound quality and they

152
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,569
like the information they go on to say

153
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,310
they've been listening to all the grow

154
00:05:27,569 --> 00:05:31,319
lessons and they are extremely helpful

155
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:35,848
so I appreciate that they wrap it up

156
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:38,129
with Irie Gang Gang Gang Gang buzz buzz

157
00:05:35,848 --> 00:05:39,779
thanks for the great review I appreciate

158
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:41,339
it that people appreciate the top tier

159
00:05:39,779 --> 00:05:44,038
sound quality coz I put a little effort

160
00:05:41,339 --> 00:05:45,629
into that I was an audio kind of a guy

161
00:05:44,038 --> 00:05:47,579
before I really got into the podcast

162
00:05:45,629 --> 00:05:49,408
thing so I'm glad people notice I'm glad

163
00:05:47,579 --> 00:05:51,810
they like the top tier information and

164
00:05:49,408 --> 00:05:53,370
those grow lessons took a lot of work so

165
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:56,098

good to know my friends are listening to

168
00:05:57,418 --> 00:06:01,439
the same podcast that I'm listening to

169
00:05:59,129 --> 00:06:02,848
all right this next review comes from

170
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:03,839
our friends up north big shout out to

171
00:06:02,848 --> 00:06:06,629
our friends in Canada

172
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:09,000
this one says Rasta Jeff my dude they

173
00:06:06,629 --> 00:06:12,060
gave us 5 stars and it says Rasta Jeff

174
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:16,079
is the most effective cannabis

175
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:18,389
cultivation educator around these parts

176
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:20,788
that's a huge compliment dude the most

177
00:06:18,389 --> 00:06:22,288
effective that means a lot like that

178
00:06:20,788 --> 00:06:25,560
means the effort we're putting in is

179
00:06:22,288 --> 00:06:28,408
doing the most work results you or

180
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:31,860
comment on those parts around those well

181
00:06:28,408 --> 00:06:33,959
there you go maybe I'm the only well

182
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:35,699
Jesse you go to just go out of control

183
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:37,680
folks every now and then we got a little

184
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:39,229
that's the truth maybe I'm the only one

185
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,060
round those parts which still

186
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:43,280
means on the best damn it then they said

187
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:44,569
the Willie Nelson Snoop Dogg over here

188
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:45,319
so I guess that's another huge

189
00:06:44,569 --> 00:06:48,139
compliment

190
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:51,110
I started this podcast on a two to three

191
00:06:48,139 --> 00:06:53,180
hour commute to a job I hated the

192
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:54,920
podcast inspired me to become a novice

193
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:57,350
home grower so we got him growing yeah

194
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:59,780

195
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:02,300
perfected my craft I've entered the

196
00:06:59,779 --> 00:07:05,839
Canadian cannabis industry worked my way

197
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:08,300

228
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:14,180
down we've got a couple of more reviews

229
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:16,069
this website keeps refreshing itself

230
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:17,990
because there is an ad so it's hard for

231
00:08:16,069 --> 00:08:20,120
me to keep track of my place on this

232
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:23,170
page but we're gonna get through it

233
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:26,769
together technology shall not defeat me

234
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:29,840
you look like you doubt me bro no I

235
00:08:26,769 --> 00:08:31,250
don't know it might just also looks like

236
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:32,899
you're playing tic-tac-toe yourself on

237
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:34,279
your list I'm just making sure to cross

238
00:08:32,899 --> 00:08:35,598
out the ones we do so that I don't read

239
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:37,490
them all over again because nobody wants

240
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,379
to hear these twice in fact we'll get to

241
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:40,490
another review in a minute this one

242
00:08:39,379 --> 00:08:43,729
comes from our friend

243
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:46,399
he says Wales UK and they gave us five

244
00:08:43,729 --> 00:08:48,259
stars they are called Zootopia and

245
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,000
they're listening on Apple podcasts from

246
00:08:48,259 --> 00:08:53,080
Great Britain apparently they're from

247
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:58,090
Wales UK they say let's hear about out

248
00:08:53,080 --> 00:09:00,340
gorillas grow Otto flower tips um that's

249
00:08:58,090 --> 00:09:03,610
not my wheelhouse I would fail at that I

250
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:06,370
did a decent outdoor grow lesson it was

251
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:08,019
a little bit but Otto flower is not my

252
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:09,730
wheelhouse I don't know much about Otto

253
00:09:08,019 --> 00:09:11,829
flowers and anything I did I would have

254
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:14,379
to just fake it for you so that wouldn't

255
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:17,710
be a quality podcast in my opinion we

256
00:09:14,379 --> 00:09:21,970
could do a little show on like gorillas

257
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:24,540
growing general tips or house [Â __Â ] used

258
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:26,620
to be back here in the struggle but days

259
00:09:24,539 --> 00:09:28,509
struggle but I've heard that worked a

260
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:30,429
minute when I first heard of flowers

261
00:09:28,509 --> 00:09:32,289
that was the first the first place my

262
00:09:30,429 --> 00:09:35,559
brain went was like those be perfect for

263
00:09:32,289 --> 00:09:38,679
a struggle but crap yeah struggle bud

264
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:41,489
was a term for planting seeds it kind of

265
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:44,889
in the wilderness in a location that was

266
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:47,950
likely to produce some sort of growth

267
00:09:44,889 --> 00:09:51,039
without any intervention from you from

268
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:53,410
the the state like when you put the seed

269
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:54,789
in the ground until you come back six

270
00:09:53,409 --> 00:09:56,079
months later and rip it out of the

271
00:09:54,789 --> 00:09:59,740
ground and run away real quick in the

272
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:01,120
dark that was struggle blood grown [Â __Â ]

273
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:02,980
half of the people I knew with home

274
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,139
grows outside had some struggle but

275
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:07,330
going on and [Â __Â ] look like yeah

276
00:10:05,139 --> 00:10:09,580

286
00:10:26,289 --> 00:10:30,009

moving forward the review goes like this

297
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:53,409
please stop wasting episodes by reading

298
00:10:51,009 --> 00:10:55,409
iTunes reviews if I wanted to hear

299
00:10:53,409 --> 00:10:57,879
reviews I'd read them aloud to myself

300
00:10:55,409 --> 00:11:00,069
I'd do more episodes with your strain

301
00:10:57,879 --> 00:11:02,830
info answering emails grow tips and

302
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:04,900
white mic with other potential guests I

303
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:06,040
love the show I look forward to each and

304
00:11:04,899 --> 00:11:08,019
every episode

305
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:10,569
but the ones when you read reviews feel

306
00:11:08,019 --> 00:11:12,399
like a waste of my time and yours I

307
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:14,260
appreciate the fact that you read the

308
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,959
reviews and please take this as a

309
00:11:14,259 --> 00:11:20,319
constructive critique and not a dig five

310
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:23,110
out of five stars for most episodes 0

311
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,700
out of 5 for the ones when you use most

312
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:27,940
of the episode up by reading reviews

313
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:29,950
keep up the work

314
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:32,050
I appreciate the review I appreciate the

315
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:34,360
feedback

316
00:11:32,049 --> 00:11:35,979
my voice did a weird thing there I kind

317
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,980
of like to edit that gonna keep moving

318
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:42,039
um what really helps a podcast to get

319
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:44,740
exposure is when somebody leaves a

320
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:46,569
review that helps us get noticed on the

321
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:48,909
front page of iTunes that makes you more

322
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:51,430
popular in their algorithm requests

323
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:53,980
that's the truth I request reviews I'm

324
00:11:51,429 --> 00:11:55,839
asking people to do that as a favor as a

325
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:58,420
return to that favor I read their

326
00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:01,360
reviews on the podcast I know I'm not

327
00:11:58,419 --> 00:12:03,250
maybe not your favorite grow person

328
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,930
maybe I'm not any sort of important

329
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:07,779
person to you I know that every time

330
00:12:04,929 --> 00:12:09,489
Joey Diaz says my name on the podcast I

331
00:12:07,779 --> 00:12:11,980
know that every time the dude grows crew

332
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:13,990
says my name on the podcast I still feel

333
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:15,519
a little smile inside I get a little

334
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:17,019
goofy in my heart I'm like ah they're

335
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:19,389
talking about me on my favorite podcast

336
00:12:17,019 --> 00:12:21,579
right now so when I read people's

337
00:12:19,389 --> 00:12:23,439
reviews and I'm reading their [Â __Â ] they

338
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:25,000
feel like they're connected I've done

339
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,100
them a favor they've done me a favor

340
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,679
it's a communal effort so that's why I

341
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:31,570
read the reviews I say I will read your

342
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:33,099
review on a future episode and so people

343
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:35,200
leave a review they want to hear it they

344
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:36,820
want to hear me say it I think it's a

345
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,590
great thing to do it's an exchange I

346
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:40,360
thought we both get something out of it

347
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:43,210
so I appreciate that you find it to be a

348
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:45,310
waste of time there's a little skip

349
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:47,800
button on your iPad on your iPhone it's

350
00:12:45,309 --> 00:12:53,289
15 or 30 seconds for just mash on that a

351
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:55,529

355
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:05,050

356
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:06,490

357
00:13:05,049 --> 00:13:07,479

likes the girl episode so he'll be cool

369
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:28,139

00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:30,210
this and doesn't know we even read his

371

00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:39,659
through this alright I think that is a

376
00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:41,309
good spot to stop with the listener

377
00:13:39,659 --> 00:13:43,829
reviews I want to thank everybody for

378
00:13:41,309 --> 00:13:45,959
the listener reviews we really really

379
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:48,360
appreciate every single review even the

380
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:51,240
ones that are negative or focused on

381
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:53,009
something that the reviewer would like

382
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,600
us to do different every review is

383
00:13:53,009 --> 00:13:57,269
helpful and appreciate it thank you I

384
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:59,909
may take some of the constructive

385
00:13:57,269 --> 00:14:02,069
criticism and I may use it I'm pretty

386
00:13:59,909 --> 00:14:04,589
set it the way that this show goes I'm

387
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:06,780
comfortable I look how many notes we've

388
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:08,580
got okay feel like four notes here for

389
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:09,659
this whole show it's all I need we could

390
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:11,700
just turn on a mic we could start

391
00:14:09,659 --> 00:14:13,439
talking I'm not going to change a lot

392
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,820
but if something really pisses somebody

393
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,280
off or something we would consider it

394
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:18,720
and I'm I will listen to opinions but

395
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:21,149
this is the way the show is gonna go bro

396
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,310
we're good at this by now yeah we've got

397
00:14:21,149 --> 00:14:24,689
a nice little rhythm down I think we're

398
00:14:23,309 --> 00:14:26,549
both real comfortable with it and enjoy

399
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:28,680
doing it and I think we've found a fan

400
00:14:26,549 --> 00:14:32,669
base that enjoys listening to us do it

401
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:34,579
so far like and if you don't agree with

402
00:14:32,669 --> 00:14:37,860
that please hit me up on Twitter it's at

403
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:40,020
15 or public acceptable cannabis laws on

404
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:41,669
Facebook hit up Mike I was gonna say

405
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:43,169
when you're in a room and like one

406
00:14:41,669 --> 00:14:45,029
person says hey you're an [Â __Â ]

407
00:14:43,169 --> 00:14:46,709
that one person may have had a bad

408
00:14:45,029 --> 00:14:48,750
experience with you two people go you're

409
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:50,879
an [Â __Â ] that could be that other

410
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:52,110
person's friend but if three or four

411
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:54,899
people start going you're an [Â __Â ]

412
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:57,419
you're probably the [Â __Â ] so far like

413
00:14:54,899 --> 00:15:00,120
one out of every 50 reviews say we suck

414
00:14:57,419 --> 00:15:01,949
so we're doing okay in my opinion yeah

415
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,299
we're not an [Â __Â ] yet you're not

416
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:04,230
succeeding unless somebody's dating

417
00:15:03,299 --> 00:15:06,750
that's right

418
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:09,899
Michael Franti said if I don't have any

419
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:11,639

she said bro he goes on to say I came

465
00:16:39,789 --> 00:16:43,899
across your podcast about a month or so

466
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:45,759
ago by the way of episode 138 breeding

467
00:16:43,899 --> 00:16:47,769
and harvesting seeds I was hooked after

468
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:49,559
hearing how informative and in-depth you

469
00:16:47,769 --> 00:16:52,960
were in explaining genetics and

470
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:55,569
feminization Ruby's gonna motya awesome

471
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:57,700
thank you for listening yeah glad you're

472
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:59,260
listening to the breeding episodes then

473
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:01,210
he says I started listening to all of

474
00:16:59,259 --> 00:17:02,649
your grow lessons which have really

475
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:04,180
brought together everything else that I

476
00:17:02,649 --> 00:17:06,369
have read through my research about

477
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:08,709
growing and made it simple and easy to

478
00:17:06,369 --> 00:17:10,239
understand that means a lot to me

479
00:17:08,709 --> 00:17:13,259
because that is kind of my goal I want

480
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:15,549
it simple for everybody to understand

481
00:17:13,259 --> 00:17:17,470
people learn with different brain types

482
00:17:15,549 --> 00:17:19,029
people learn by looking by hearing by

483
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:20,829
doing so people are just hands-on

484
00:17:19,029 --> 00:17:22,750
learners I try to make it easy for

485
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:24,730
everybody even those hands-on people I'm

486
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,599
thinking about it like Mike sees me

487
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:27,519
right now I'm like looking

488
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:29,469
telepathically up into the sky and I'm

489
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:31,000
putting my hands in shapes so that I can

490
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:32,529
do those things while I'm thinking about

491
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,779
it so I can explain it to you as

492
00:17:32,529 --> 00:17:36,069
thoroughly as possible so I'm glad that

493
00:17:34,779 --> 00:17:38,440
somebody's learning I'm glad you're

494
00:17:36,069 --> 00:17:41,319
appreciating that this has been a great

495
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:44,470
message there is still more he goes on

496
00:17:41,319 --> 00:17:46,149
to say I have some bubblegum some ak-47

497
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:48,549
some purple haze and

498
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:51,280
Widow seeds and was wondering what your

499
00:17:48,549 --> 00:17:53,829
opinions are on these varieties and if

500
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:56,049
any of them would make good or decent

501
00:17:53,829 --> 00:17:59,409
hybrids they sign it with thanks from

502
00:17:56,049 --> 00:18:01,299
big tea then they say you and white Mike

503
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:04,200
should come to Australia as consultants

504
00:18:01,299 --> 00:18:07,240
to our government on legalization

505
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:08,529
I'd love to I'm not sure I want to go

506
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:10,960
there because everything there is trying

507
00:18:08,529 --> 00:18:12,250
to [Â __Â ] kill me not in the city not

508
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,680
in the city all right we'll be cool yeah

509
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:16,539
taken I've ascent just 90 percent of the

510
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:18,400
stuff trying 90 percent of the rest of

511
00:18:16,539 --> 00:18:20,200
the city stuff so if we go out of that

512
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,670
little wine we're gonna get murdered by

513
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,200
some crazy animal and I'm just playing

514
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:25,289
Australia's got a reputation for having

515
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:28,330
some crazy [Â __Â ] wildlife out there

516
00:18:25,289 --> 00:18:32,200
I'm interested let's go to a grow some

517
00:18:28,329 --> 00:18:35,199
Australian cannabis let's do it oh that

518
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:37,870
may be a thing so let's see where do we

519
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:41,140
start he wants to know if he's got

520
00:18:37,869 --> 00:18:43,239
bubblegum ak-47 Purple Haze and white

521
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:45,370
widow seeds and he's wondering my

522
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:47,740
opinions on these varieties and if any

523
00:18:45,369 --> 00:18:52,629
of them would make good or decent

524
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:54,940
hybrids I can't see your plants I can

525
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:57,040
see your a list of strains which you

526
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:58,930
have got and I can hope that those are

527
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:01,119
truly the genetics that that seed

528
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:02,620
package claims they are I don't know

529
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:04,629
where the Bubblegum came from I don't

530
00:19:02,619 --> 00:19:05,979
know where the ak-47 came from I don't

531
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:07,990
know where the Purple Haze or the white

532
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:10,120
widow seeds came from I knew who

533
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:12,849
originally bred those yeah what makes me

534
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:16,479
nervous about those that strain list is

535
00:19:12,849 --> 00:19:19,779
it sounds oddly familiar from our kind

536
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:22,480
of distant past you know I was I thought

537
00:19:19,779 --> 00:19:23,230
the same but also there in Australia so

538
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,120
they may

539
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:26,620
culture takes a little time to travel

540
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:28,359
maybe that's where they are maybe

541
00:19:26,619 --> 00:19:30,609
they're still in their time capsule is

542
00:19:28,359 --> 00:19:32,679
still there with those genetics so I was

543
00:19:30,609 --> 00:19:34,299
gonna let that slide and not judge too

544
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:36,279
harshly on that but yes that is like

545
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:37,809
that's like having a bunch of Mickey

546
00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:39,220
Mantle rookie cards back in the day

547
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:41,200
you've got some pretty good stuff there

548
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:43,210
if that's real you've got some great

549
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,850
[Â __Â ] I don't want to question or doubt

550
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:47,769
the legitimacy of these seeds I know who

551
00:19:45,849 --> 00:19:49,750
bred most of those things I know who I

552
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:51,039
would like to see on the packaging for

553
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:52,990
most of those but I don't know what

554
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:54,849
you've got so without seeing the

555
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:58,339
packaging without seeing the seeds I

556
00:19:54,849 --> 00:20:01,609
don't know if what those are all

557
00:19:58,339 --> 00:20:03,079
so I can't see the plants I don't see

558
00:20:01,609 --> 00:20:05,658
your phenotypes I don't know what you've

559
00:20:03,079 --> 00:20:08,599
got to work with that is kind of how on

560
00:20:05,659 --> 00:20:10,039
paper I could look at the genetics and I

561
00:20:08,599 --> 00:20:11,329
know that white widow is great to breed

562
00:20:10,038 --> 00:20:12,558
with I know that I would like to breed

563
00:20:11,329 --> 00:20:15,408
with the white widow I've grown

564
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:17,658
bubblegum and a K I could probably think

565
00:20:15,409 --> 00:20:19,340
of some creative ways to breed around

566
00:20:17,659 --> 00:20:20,840
there are some cubes some triangles some

567
00:20:19,339 --> 00:20:23,209
open pollination x' I could think of

568
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:26,538
great things to do but without seeing

569
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:29,329
the plants I don't know what would work

570
00:20:26,538 --> 00:20:31,929
best I need to see each plant that is I

571
00:20:29,329 --> 00:20:34,849
think as a breeder I'm kind of like a

572
00:20:31,929 --> 00:20:36,860
plant matchmaker I've got to find two

573
00:20:34,849 --> 00:20:38,658
plants that I'm gonna look at him and

574
00:20:36,859 --> 00:20:40,519
grow them and some and smell them and

575
00:20:38,659 --> 00:20:42,320
experience that picking from a list like

576
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:43,579
this is sort of like trying to pick two

577
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:46,099
people who are gonna hit it off from

578
00:20:43,579 --> 00:20:47,569
names in a phone book I was gonna make

579
00:20:46,099 --> 00:20:49,969
that analogy pretty soon I was gonna be

580
00:20:47,569 --> 00:20:53,000
like so do you think Bill and Karen will

581
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:55,700
get along we don't know anything about

582
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,038
film or care just two white people

583
00:20:55,700 --> 00:21:00,528
probably bill and Karen we have no input

584
00:20:58,038 --> 00:21:02,089
on them so I don't know how these are

585
00:21:00,528 --> 00:21:04,398
going to breed I wish that I had more

586
00:21:02,089 --> 00:21:06,048
input so if you do choose to breed with

587
00:21:04,398 --> 00:21:07,609
them I would pick one or two packs of

588
00:21:06,048 --> 00:21:09,528
seeds and I would get those started I

589
00:21:07,609 --> 00:21:11,178
would select a couple of males a couple

590
00:21:09,528 --> 00:21:12,829
of females that really stand out for

591
00:21:11,179 --> 00:21:14,149
whatever reasons you believe you're the

592
00:21:12,829 --> 00:21:16,730
breeder now you get to make those

593
00:21:14,148 --> 00:21:19,879
decisions and then I would work projects

594
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:21,288
as desired from there as Mike said a

595
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:23,240
second ago it sounds like you've got

596
00:21:21,288 --> 00:21:25,069
you've got four different packs of seeds

597
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:27,169
to choose from so you've definitely got

598
00:21:25,069 --> 00:21:29,778
enough stuff to start a breeding project

599
00:21:27,169 --> 00:21:31,399
the thing is that you have to do it by

600
00:21:29,778 --> 00:21:33,829
looking at the plants you can't just do

601
00:21:31,398 --> 00:21:35,898
it these all look good on paper yeah

602
00:21:33,829 --> 00:21:37,428
until you see him for any it's hard to

603
00:21:35,898 --> 00:21:39,439
tell yeah you've got they all look good

604
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:41,059
on paper but you don't know which males

605
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,130
are gonna look good which females are

606
00:21:41,058 --> 00:21:44,839
gonna look good you'll have something to

607
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:46,580
do some sort of a breeding project if

608
00:21:44,839 --> 00:21:47,959
you pop two packs of seeds if you pop

609
00:21:46,579 --> 00:21:49,639
three packs of seeds you'll find

610
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:51,649
something find a solid male out of there

611
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:54,620
that looks like it'll work perfectly for

612
00:21:51,648 --> 00:21:56,569
you and then find a girl from all three

613
00:21:54,619 --> 00:22:00,229
packs of seeds so that you've got maybe

614
00:21:56,569 --> 00:22:02,329
a bubblegum female an ak47 female and a

615
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:04,278
white widow female and then perhaps a

616
00:22:02,329 --> 00:22:05,538
white widow male and pollinate all three

617
00:22:04,278 --> 00:22:07,669
of the girls with the one male you can

618
00:22:05,538 --> 00:22:10,038
make white widow f2s and then you can

619
00:22:07,669 --> 00:22:12,910
make white bubblegum and you can make

620
00:22:10,038 --> 00:22:16,819
aka bubblegum for tea

621
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:17,900
RAK white widow 47 it's just that way

622
00:22:16,819 --> 00:22:19,099
you can do a little bit of breeding and

623
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:20,660
then you get to grow all those seeds

624
00:22:19,099 --> 00:22:22,250
you'll have a lot of seeds to play with

625
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:24,620
but that's probably the way that I would

626
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:26,089
do it I would grow them you gotta grow

627
00:22:24,619 --> 00:22:27,469
them you gotta be I can't be a

628
00:22:26,089 --> 00:22:29,599
matchmaker without knowing some

629
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:31,789
personalities it doesn't work out that

630
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:33,019
way um and if you want to make some

631
00:22:31,789 --> 00:22:35,089
feminized stuff then you just got to

632
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:37,639
find a solid female and then reverse it

633
00:22:35,089 --> 00:22:39,589
then pollinate the same cultivar a

634
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:42,830
different clone of the same cultivar and

635
00:22:39,589 --> 00:22:44,209
you can make your feminized seeds I wish

636
00:22:42,829 --> 00:22:46,369
I had better input for you my friend

637
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:48,289
without seeing the plants I really don't

638
00:22:46,369 --> 00:22:49,579
know what to tell you I on paper I know

639
00:22:48,289 --> 00:22:51,710
what would look good of course I like

640
00:22:49,579 --> 00:22:52,789
the white widow as a male just because

641
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:54,410
there are a lot of traits I would stay

642
00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:56,299
personally I wouldn't breed with the

643
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:58,790
purple haze that's going to put a lot of

644
00:22:56,299 --> 00:23:00,440
extended time flowering time into

645
00:22:58,789 --> 00:23:03,409
everything and it's just not one of my

646
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:05,420
favorites but that clue strawberries got

647
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:07,370
a long silver grouse season well this

648
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:08,930
could all the purple haze could also be

649
00:23:07,369 --> 00:23:10,789
this person's favorite [Â __Â ] strain

650
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:12,560
and it doesn't get my attention at all

651
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:15,079
kind of a lot of Hayes's and watching

652
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:17,149
them sort of slowly disappear because

653
00:23:15,079 --> 00:23:18,949
they take more than nine weeks has been

654
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:21,340
hard for me to deal with

655
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:23,539
yeah the market has definitely changed

656
00:23:21,339 --> 00:23:25,609
well this one comes from our friend Big

657
00:23:23,539 --> 00:23:29,539
T so thanks to Big T for sending us a

658
00:23:25,609 --> 00:23:31,459
great message and they also say PS white

659
00:23:29,539 --> 00:23:33,170
might come down and be consultants for

660
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:35,450
they don't want us to go consult on the

661
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:37,640
grow or anything like that want us to

662
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:39,680
fix the Gov they want us to go help them

663
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:41,390
legalize cannabis I think what we got to

664
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:43,100
go do is go down there and set up the

665
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:44,810
podcast setup just like we've got this

666
00:23:43,099 --> 00:23:46,459
we got to take a rig we got to take some

667
00:23:44,809 --> 00:23:48,109
flowers I'll be your ambassador or a

668
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:49,789
weed and then we've got to go smoke down

669
00:23:48,109 --> 00:23:51,139
and while we're smoking we need to be

670
00:23:49,789 --> 00:23:52,970
interviewed by people so that they can

671
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:55,400
see that we can medicate properly and we

672
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:56,990
could still produce and actually and act

673
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,550
like border wasn't called responsible

674
00:23:56,990 --> 00:24:01,220
productive citizens what do you want to

675
00:23:58,549 --> 00:24:03,349
call us responsible productive citizens

676
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:05,360
is pretty much exactly what I like to be

677
00:24:03,349 --> 00:24:07,129
called pretty much exactly you sound

678
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:09,500
like one of my old bosses and throwing

679
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:11,930
handsome in there and I'm right don't

680
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:13,400
make me edit this [Â __Â ] yep alright Mike

681
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:15,289
let's keep moving with this I've got

682
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:17,570
another email if you've been listening

683
00:24:15,289 --> 00:24:18,950
to this show regularly that was harder

684
00:24:17,569 --> 00:24:21,139
to say than it should have been while if

685
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:23,000
you have been listening regularly you

686
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:24,740
may remember that in a recent episode we

687
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,369
read an email from a friend of ours

688
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:27,769
who

689
00:24:25,369 --> 00:24:30,079
grew and smoked some lemon Geoffrey that

690
00:24:27,769 --> 00:24:30,710
he flowered for 11 weeks if I remember

691
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:33,289
correctly

692
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:36,079
it blew his mind I asked for more

693
00:24:33,289 --> 00:24:38,119
information he was listening we've got

694
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:41,569
more information magic at the Internet

695
00:24:38,119 --> 00:24:43,309
baby he magic it says it was a trip to

696
00:24:41,569 --> 00:24:45,980
hear you and Mike read and react to my

697
00:24:43,309 --> 00:24:48,950
email I'm glad you like that that's why

698
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:50,900
I read read your reaction our words bro

699
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:54,110
it's a trip to read your reaction to our

700
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:56,390
reaction man I goes on to say I bought

701
00:24:54,109 --> 00:24:58,819
the pack of lemon Jeffery from dank seed

702
00:24:56,390 --> 00:25:01,940
I think I only popped one seed because

703
00:24:58,819 --> 00:25:03,549
it was all I had room for at the time so

704
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:05,539
an old vendor when he don't work with

705
00:25:03,549 --> 00:25:07,549
yeah I was gonna say an old vendor that

706
00:25:05,539 --> 00:25:09,319
we're no longer working with but there

707
00:25:07,549 --> 00:25:11,690
are plenty of other good opportunities I

708
00:25:09,319 --> 00:25:14,509
check out seeds here now or the hell a

709
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:16,309
dank seed company I'm pretty sure he

710
00:25:14,509 --> 00:25:18,049
means the old dank seed so that is not

711
00:25:16,309 --> 00:25:19,849
hella dank seed company we do still do

712
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:21,289
business with them support them let's

713
00:25:19,849 --> 00:25:23,539
keep moving before it gets confusing he

714
00:25:21,289 --> 00:25:26,240
says I wanted to make sure I had room to

715
00:25:23,539 --> 00:25:28,430
trellis so he only had one one plant he

716
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:32,390
wanted room the plant filled up about a

717
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:34,910
2 by 3 foot canopy and he let a lot of

718
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:37,550
smaller nodes go full term to avoid

719
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:39,470
getting any really thick buds he said

720
00:25:37,549 --> 00:25:42,440
airflow is never good enough for a

721
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:44,720
closet tent in our state I'll leave his

722
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:47,029
state out of there we don't need to

723
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:49,100
narrow down his location so he got one

724
00:25:47,029 --> 00:25:52,819
lemon Jeffries seed he grew it in a 2 by

725
00:25:49,099 --> 00:25:54,980
3 area a lot of smaller nugs he says

726
00:25:52,819 --> 00:25:57,230
even at 11 weeks I wasn't seeing much

727
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:59,180
amber except at the very top of the

728
00:25:57,230 --> 00:26:01,460
plant I was thinking I'd probably

729
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:04,130
stalled or slowed them along the way

730
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:06,079
with a misstep I wish there were more

731
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:08,120
details on there because I would assume

732
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:09,740
that that is what messed them up a

733
00:26:08,119 --> 00:26:12,829
misstep something slowed them down I

734
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:15,049
don't see that plant taking 11 weeks so

735
00:26:12,829 --> 00:26:17,299
there yeah I wish I knew more about what

736
00:26:15,049 --> 00:26:18,769
you're suppose it our possible misstep

737
00:26:17,299 --> 00:26:20,720
was because I assume that's gonna be

738
00:26:18,769 --> 00:26:21,859
what slowed him down but man whatever

739
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,500
you did it sounds like you made some

740
00:26:21,859 --> 00:26:27,259
amazing mistakes it goes on to say I

741
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:29,329
pressed rosin pretty early after harvest

742
00:26:27,259 --> 00:26:31,220
and it had a slightly darker look

743
00:26:29,329 --> 00:26:34,399
leading me to believe that the trikes

744
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:35,990
were mature so maybe he wasn't looking

745
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,000
didn't see that they were actually amber

746
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:40,730
but the rosin did come out

747
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,500
we are can with yellow cantaloupe are

748
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:44,509
you looking with how how good your scope

749
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,950
do you need to clean your lens he keeps

750
00:26:44,509 --> 00:26:47,869
going I didn't push her much at all

751
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:49,490
meaning he didn't feed her a lot is what

752
00:26:47,869 --> 00:26:52,369
I'm gonna assume that means I had a nice

753
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:54,920
organic amended soil and I supplemented

754
00:26:52,369 --> 00:26:58,879
with 1/4 strength organic bottled newts

755
00:26:54,920 --> 00:27:00,800
and some top dressing and microbes that

756
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,750
that makes it taste really good if you

757
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:05,299
don't overfeed the lemon Jeffrey she

758
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:07,069
comes out nice and sweet that goes on to

759
00:27:05,299 --> 00:27:09,049
say I did not keep a clone of this one

760
00:27:07,069 --> 00:27:10,669
is I had to break off the Grove for a

761
00:27:09,049 --> 00:27:14,539
couple of months that's understandable

762
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:16,370
this is I'm back on it now yeah welcome

763
00:27:14,539 --> 00:27:17,779
back bro I bet it feels great to be back

764
00:27:16,369 --> 00:27:19,549
growing again it always sucks that to

765
00:27:17,779 --> 00:27:20,930
tear down the grove for a minute we

766
00:27:19,549 --> 00:27:23,029
don't know where you are I do know where

767
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:25,580
you are sometimes [Â __Â ] goes on

768
00:27:23,029 --> 00:27:27,440
especially there so be careful where are

769
00:27:25,579 --> 00:27:29,689
we it says my wife and I polished off

770
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:33,289
our last lemon Jeffrey this morning and

771
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:34,460
we will be on dispensary for a while man

772
00:27:33,289 --> 00:27:36,950
I'm sorry about that he says it's

773
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:39,019
heartbreaking and expensive if you can

774
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:41,480
find some quality dispensary buds around

775
00:27:39,019 --> 00:27:44,089
there yeah it's rough to go from your

776
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:45,650
personal back to the store shelf why'd

777
00:27:44,089 --> 00:27:48,169
you give me that look Mike it's just

778
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:50,450
that's that's just life yeah I get it

779
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:52,850
I get it there is more to this great

780
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:55,490
message it says the next run of lemon

781
00:27:52,849 --> 00:27:57,349
Jeffrey will be at least two plants so I

782
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:59,450
can harvest one a little earlier and

783
00:27:57,349 --> 00:28:02,089
taste her as intended by the breeder and

784
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:05,150
another so I can revisit this late

785
00:28:02,089 --> 00:28:07,669
harvest again and compare now I'm

786
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:10,160
curious if I that misstep will show in

787
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:12,830
this next trial runs down with the same

788
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:15,410
spot again in the same way or don't and

789
00:28:12,829 --> 00:28:17,210
see if that 11 week flower is really

790
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:18,890
what that plant needs if it works twice

791
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:20,480
then it's not an accident there's

792
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:22,430
something cool about that right but

793
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,839
maybe it might have been that misstep we

794
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:24,590
don't know unless we try again and don't

795
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:25,939
do that

796
00:28:24,589 --> 00:28:27,740
and then we have to keep trying under

797
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:31,400
different conditions I like running

798
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:34,279
experiments they can go forever there is

799
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:37,250
more it says thanks again Mike and

800

811
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:02,538
dangerous location but if you can sneak

812
00:29:01,159 --> 00:29:04,278
a few shots in you don't have to post

813
00:29:02,538 --> 00:29:06,500
them to social media I do have an email

814
00:29:04,278 --> 00:29:07,099
account you can easily shoot them to the

815
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:09,259
email

816
00:29:07,099 --> 00:29:11,808

817
00:29:09,259 --> 00:29:13,278
that mean buddy I just three bad jokes

818
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:15,259

819
00:29:13,278 --> 00:29:18,798
them I just cringe I appreciate that

820
00:29:15,259 --> 00:29:20,750
so city an email I think we want to

821
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:22,519
follow this little grill where we dig it

822
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:24,109
yeah I like the small sets they're fun

823
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:26,720
to see you don't produce that and there

824
00:29:24,109 --> 00:29:29,538
could go big to have a blast growing at

825
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:32,210
home one plant to plant pop in one seed

826
00:29:29,538 --> 00:29:33,798
at a time that's there's absolutely

827
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:35,808
nothing wrong with that grow your heart

828
00:29:33,798 --> 00:29:37,970
out one seed at a time somebody made a

829
00:29:35,808 --> 00:29:39,980
joke today in another podcast I

830
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:42,919
participate in I'm also on the embracing

831
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:46,640
organics live podcast on YouTube every

832
00:29:42,919 --> 00:29:47,809
Thursday at 7 mountain time um but I was

833
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,340
on there and somebody said something

834
00:29:47,808 --> 00:29:52,178
about I know I'm just a basement grower

835
00:29:49,339 --> 00:29:55,250
so excuse me Jeff and I was like oh bro

836
00:29:52,179 --> 00:29:57,620
not to interrupt you but I was like I I

837
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:59,509
am a basement grower yes I have a lot of

838
00:29:57,619 --> 00:30:01,819
commercial experience yes I have been a

839
00:29:59,509 --> 00:30:05,569
lot of places through and for growing

840
00:30:01,819 --> 00:30:07,700
but like almost all of us I started with

841
00:30:05,569 --> 00:30:10,038
a light in the basement and I still

842
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:12,620
remember those days I still honor those

843
00:30:10,038 --> 00:30:14,990
days I still appreciate and respect

844
00:30:12,619 --> 00:30:17,298
those days I've got as much love and

845
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:20,058
respect for a basement grower as I do

846
00:30:17,298 --> 00:30:21,648
a guy with 20 lights as I do for a guy

847
00:30:20,058 --> 00:30:22,308
with fifty to a hundred to five hundred

848
00:30:21,648 --> 00:30:23,928
lights

849
00:30:22,308 --> 00:30:26,089
we're all growers we're all doing the

850
00:30:23,929 --> 00:30:28,250
same [Â __Â ] it's all a passion we're all

851
00:30:26,089 --> 00:30:30,109
in it because we love growing we love

852
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:32,990
cannabis we love the effects of cannabis

853
00:30:30,109 --> 00:30:34,668
so don't don't think that I think I'm

854
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:37,429
hot [Â __Â ] because I'm a commercial grower

855
00:30:34,669 --> 00:30:38,870
I got nothing but love for the basement

856
00:30:37,429 --> 00:30:40,159
grower that's where I started that's

857
00:30:38,869 --> 00:30:42,469
where I came from

858
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:44,028
never forget your roots I'm a basement

859
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:46,190
grower kind of guy I know I talk about

860
00:30:44,028 --> 00:30:47,929
get out of the basement mentality in the

861
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:50,179
commercial grower mindset if that's

862
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:52,309
where you are if did I still got a drum

863
00:30:50,179 --> 00:30:54,860
set in the basement I've played huge

864
00:30:52,308 --> 00:30:56,599
[Â __Â ] places and I have just as much

865
00:30:54,859 --> 00:30:58,038
fun and just as much passion and when

866
00:30:56,599 --> 00:30:59,569
I'm playing in the basement on Thursday

867
00:30:58,038 --> 00:31:01,819
night before I have to do a podcast

868
00:30:59,569 --> 00:31:03,648
after dinner just killing an hour I have

869
00:31:01,819 --> 00:31:05,720
the greatest time so whatever you're

870
00:31:03,648 --> 00:31:07,369
doing if you do it with your heart any

871
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:09,289
I got mad respect for it so don't ever

872
00:31:07,369 --> 00:31:11,569
think that just cuz I've gotten real far

873
00:31:09,289 --> 00:31:13,250
that I got any sort of not belittling

874
00:31:11,569 --> 00:31:16,189
any basement Grover at all

875
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:17,869
you don't gotta go baby us you know they

876
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:20,870
have a more of a struggle than us

877
00:31:17,869 --> 00:31:22,579
I can call I'm not gonna say the name of

878
00:31:20,869 --> 00:31:24,829
our vendors or anybody I can call people

879
00:31:22,579 --> 00:31:26,599
in another state or in another County

880
00:31:24,829 --> 00:31:28,399
couple miles north and go hey I need a

881
00:31:26,599 --> 00:31:30,289
pallet of this two pallets of this five

882
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,730
bottles of this and this they put it on

883
00:31:30,289 --> 00:31:34,579
a company credit card they show up with

884
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:36,500
a semi we get a forklift and pull a

885
00:31:34,579 --> 00:31:38,750
[Â __Â ] pallet of stuff out into a

886
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:40,640
warehouse high-five the driver and sign

887
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:43,039
for it you can't do that at your home

888
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:44,690
grow you got to go in some places know

889
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:46,819
to do a throwback earlier when they're

890
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:48,380
asking about guerilla growing a lot of

891
00:31:46,819 --> 00:31:49,579
those tips are the same for for home

892
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:50,870
growing somewhere were you ain't

893
00:31:49,579 --> 00:31:54,619
supposed to be homegrown or where it's

894
00:31:50,869 --> 00:31:56,479
brand-new um if I was on an East Coast

895
00:31:54,619 --> 00:31:59,119
if I was in an East Coast state right as

896
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:00,799
they were going legal I'd still be just

897
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:01,579
as nervous as I was here when we were

898
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:03,769
just going legal

899
00:32:01,579 --> 00:32:05,539
with growing at home and stuff because

900
00:32:03,769 --> 00:32:07,940
it's still worth several thousand a

901
00:32:05,539 --> 00:32:09,799
pound and that's though your ass if the

902
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:11,960
wrong people hear about it yep yep see

903
00:32:09,799 --> 00:32:13,460
and you have to be careful not because

904
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:16,819
of just the thieves but because of the

905
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:19,130
law you have to use the law the hassle

906
00:32:16,819 --> 00:32:20,629
the headache you got to drive one car at

907
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:21,950
the gross store drive to your friend's

908
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:23,270
house park in the garage

909
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:25,100
get all the [Â __Â ] out of that car put it

910
00:32:23,269 --> 00:32:27,920
in your car drive your car to your house

911
00:32:25,099 --> 00:32:30,289
to the garage unload for a while my

912
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:32,750
hustle was buying supplies for growers

913
00:32:30,289 --> 00:32:36,139
like that was the thing I did for side

914
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:38,299
money was I would call up my growers I

915
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:41,360
knew gave my shopping list for the day

916
00:32:38,299 --> 00:32:43,819
go fill their shopping lists go home

917
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:45,740
repackage it and then later that and

918
00:32:43,819 --> 00:32:48,259
that that day or the next day go deliver

919
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:49,549
it all like that was a major side hustle

920
00:32:48,259 --> 00:32:52,190
for a minute when things were just

921
00:32:49,549 --> 00:32:54,740
started to turn the corner things are so

922
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:57,259
different now so yet my point is no

923
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:58,849
