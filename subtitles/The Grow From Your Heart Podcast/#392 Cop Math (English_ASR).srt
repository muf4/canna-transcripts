15
00:00:22,768 --> 00:00:26,579

rambles ya'll speaking of getting in a

19
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:32,939
good podcast mood it is kind of

20
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,460
tradition that we start the podcast off

21
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:37,379
by talking about what we are dabbing the

22
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,570
table looks like a small buffet of

23
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,760
concentrates I think we mainly focused

24
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:43,950
on the fluffernutter from contraband it

25
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:45,689
smells amazing it's got kind of a sweet

26
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:47,429
sharp sort of a smell that I really

27
00:00:45,689 --> 00:00:49,949
enjoy I knew Mike was a fan of that oh

28
00:00:47,429 --> 00:00:51,659
we took some tabs at bat we also may

29
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:54,000
have hid what did we hit before we went

30
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:55,679
outside on the Mandarin cookies and some

31
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,500
Mandarin cookies which had a really an

32
00:00:55,679 --> 00:01:01,109
amazing flavor a really pretty product

33
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:03,448
really pretty it's almost clear it's a

34
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:05,280
clear yellowish color I really like Bao

35
00:01:03,448 --> 00:01:07,560

78
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:34,560
series of grow lessons this is not going

79
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,880
to be a grow lesson you guys this is

80
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,259
going to be a fun episode we've got a

81
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:39,299
really cool topic but I want to talk

82
00:02:37,259 --> 00:02:42,120
about the grow series I think I have one

83
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:43,920
or two more podcasts to repost that are

84
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,599
part of the grow lesson series I know

85
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:48,089
I'm reposting old stuff but it falls in

86
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:51,090
line perfectly with the grow less I'm

87
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:53,250
actually glad you didn't try to redo dry

88
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:56,610
it was it was beautiful I felt I

89
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:58,019
listened I was like that episode well

90
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:59,970
thank you I appreciate that it the

91
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:02,159
original post I is one of the most

92
00:02:59,969 --> 00:03:04,830
listened to podcast episodes I have ever

93
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:06,659
made so I just reposted it and maybe

94
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:08,610
that's cheating but not honest you need

95
00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:10,949
a long series of grow lessons and it fit

96
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:12,720
that's where we were no reason to try

97
00:03:10,949 --> 00:03:14,518
again thank you thanks for the

98
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:17,069
validation so I've got two more episodes

99
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:19,860
that I think will be reposted then after

100
00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:21,539
that we will move into brand-new content

101
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:22,980
I do have a lot of content lined up and

102
00:03:21,539 --> 00:03:24,629
planned for you guys I've got stuff that

103
00:03:22,979 --> 00:03:26,578
I've been writing down been kind of pre

104
00:03:24,629 --> 00:03:28,229
loading I've got stuff pre-recorded so

105
00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:30,150
then when it comes time the grow lessons

106
00:03:28,229 --> 00:03:32,909
are done we can get into fresh content I

107
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:35,340
know you guys have sent me a mountain of

108
00:03:32,909 --> 00:03:36,539
emails I'm going to print them and I'll

109
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,310
read a few of them on the show we'll

110
00:03:36,539 --> 00:03:39,599
start digging through the pile if you

111
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:41,370
sent some emails and I haven't got to

112
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,959
just be patient and hopefully I'll get

113
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:44,340
to your email soon I've got a lot of

114
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,469
emails Mike those grow lessons really

115
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:49,349
held us back on emails it's been an

116
00:03:46,469 --> 00:03:51,389
intense series of lessons but it's such

117
00:03:49,349 --> 00:03:53,909
a good one it was a lot of fun to do I

118
00:03:51,389 --> 00:03:56,369
feel like I gave a lot of information I

119
00:03:53,909 --> 00:03:58,229
got a lot of praise and a lot of emails

120
00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:00,750
through the grow series and it was it

121
00:03:58,229 --> 00:04:03,238
was time for an update it had been 200

122
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:05,189
episodes since the last start to finish

123
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:06,629
gross and some of that stuff had even

124
00:04:05,189 --> 00:04:08,430
been said and I've changed a lot of my

125
00:04:06,629 --> 00:04:11,099
ideals and approaches and opinions on

126
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:13,319
things well the science has changed the

127
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:15,269
the equipment that's available it's

128
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:17,939
changed everything's taken ten steps

129
00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:20,489
forward absolutely I was saying how much

130
00:04:17,939 --> 00:04:22,168
I enjoy doing it at the same time I'm so

131
00:04:20,488 --> 00:04:25,560
glad it's over that was a lot of work

132
00:04:22,168 --> 00:04:27,240
for somebody with my uh sporadic ad D to

133
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,680
stick to a topic for that long

134
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,139
and yes there were interruptions I

135
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,668
didn't do solid grow lessons for 14

136
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:35,250
weeks I did some interruptions yeah well

137
00:04:32,668 --> 00:04:37,709
Mike came and there were other things to

138
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:40,319
talk about but cannon ball for my brain

139
00:04:37,709 --> 00:04:42,750
to try to focus for that long it was a

140
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:44,189
task for feet and a half you guys what

141
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,660
I'm trying to say is I appreciate you

142
00:04:44,189 --> 00:04:47,129

143

grow lessons thanks for listening to

144
00:04:47,129 --> 00:04:51,209

146
00:04:51,209 --> 00:04:55,049

thanks for all those emails you guys

151
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,168

152
00:05:01,228 --> 00:05:05,550
now once again also Mike thanks for

153
00:05:04,168 --> 00:05:08,038
coming taking time away from the kids oh

154
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:15,210
yeah I think it's time to get into the

155
00:05:08,038 --> 00:05:18,538
podcast I was really creepy even

156
00:05:15,209 --> 00:05:21,918
creepier stop doing that I'm looking

157
00:05:18,538 --> 00:05:25,139
around my own place a weird mood I come

158
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:26,698
energized well you uh I noticed that the

159
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:27,810
cigarette also does a little something

160
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:30,210
to you I don't smoke cigarette so we

161
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:31,680
went outside and it's there's a lot of

162
00:05:30,209 --> 00:05:34,109
terrible things about nicotine but

163
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,968
there's a reason people do it it made

164
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:38,129
you a little a little giddy a little

165
00:05:35,968 --> 00:05:39,629
happier after after that Dabin and the

166
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:40,918
cigarette put you on another smiley

167
00:05:39,629 --> 00:05:42,779
plane and then we have of course dabbed

168
00:05:40,918 --> 00:05:44,158
again before we recorded so you were you

169
00:05:42,779 --> 00:05:46,379
were well lit and that cigarette helped

170
00:05:44,158 --> 00:05:49,199
it does another extra thing getting out

171
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:50,430
helps too I've been confined lately well

172
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,158
thanks for coming you're always invited

173
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:56,900
bro recording or not come here it's hard

174
00:05:53,158 --> 00:06:04,079
to escape my life Escape from Alcatraz

175
00:05:56,899 --> 00:06:06,929
all right Mike turned purple and white

176
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:08,399
and purple again alright guys we do have

177
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:10,110
a kind of a topic for the for this

178
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:14,549
podcast here and the word that I wrote

179
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:16,919
down was cop math cop math it infuriates

180
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:18,840
Mike infuriates - at the appropriate

181
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:19,918
word it is Mike is changing colors over

182
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:24,060
there just thinking about it he's

183
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:29,189
squirming in his seat cop math so

184
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:33,209
anytime reporters report on marijuana

185
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:37,769
bust of any kind they give a money total

186
00:06:33,209 --> 00:06:39,269
at some point for example there there's

187
00:06:37,769 --> 00:06:40,889
a bunch of reports lately out of

188
00:06:39,269 --> 00:06:44,149
Colorado where there

189
00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:47,158
summarising like whole counties and

190
00:06:44,149 --> 00:06:49,138
there's so many busts over a year period

191
00:06:47,158 --> 00:06:51,089
of time and then they total up

192
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:54,569
everything they found we found 7,000

193
00:06:51,089 --> 00:06:57,028
plans we found we arrested 50 people

194
00:06:54,569 --> 00:06:58,770
that are not it out of that and then

195
00:06:57,028 --> 00:07:01,319
there's always a math problem at the end

196
00:06:58,769 --> 00:07:03,120
that says you know this is all worth and

197
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:05,460
then they give a really big number as

198
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,499
big as the cop can can say with a

199
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:10,799
straight face is usually the number

200
00:07:07,499 --> 00:07:14,639
given to the reporter and if you dig a

201
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:17,668
little bit or do the math yourself the

202
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:20,460
math gets insane and really funny really

203
00:07:17,668 --> 00:07:22,528
quickly and it's just sort of a running

204
00:07:20,459 --> 00:07:25,348
joke now that cop pop math that's

205
00:07:22,528 --> 00:07:26,908
terrible cop drug math it's terrible all

206
00:07:25,348 --> 00:07:29,519
the drugs math but especially with pot

207
00:07:26,908 --> 00:07:33,180
because marijuana well it's also the

208
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:35,519
most sold illegal drug it's legal lots

209
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:37,949
of places now but just in that

210
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:39,329
classification way more people are

211
00:07:37,949 --> 00:07:41,610
buying marijuana there's more of it to

212
00:07:39,329 --> 00:07:43,348
find it's easier to find so it gets

213
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:45,180
found a lot more so these reports come

214
00:07:43,348 --> 00:07:48,088
out a lot more often and there are

215
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:53,430
always [ __ ] nuts so you can pull

216
00:07:48,088 --> 00:07:55,978
interviews with Pueblo sheriff's or the

217
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:57,139
county right up north of us al Paso

218
00:07:55,978 --> 00:07:59,399
County there Sheriff

219
00:07:57,139 --> 00:08:00,870
have been given reports a lot lately

220
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:04,168
they're really easy to find if you just

221
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:07,050
google Colorado sheriff's marijuana bust

222
00:08:04,168 --> 00:08:09,438
and look at the numbers in the report

223
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:12,329
the sheriff's will go on at length about

224
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:14,218
how fast marijuana how they how fast

225
00:08:12,329 --> 00:08:17,430
they think marijuana grows how much they

226
00:08:14,218 --> 00:08:19,408
think it's worth and reporters do

227
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:20,848
absolutely no effort to check all this

228
00:08:19,408 --> 00:08:26,218
so the numbers that get reported are

229
00:08:20,848 --> 00:08:27,750
just insane but do you think the numbers

230
00:08:26,218 --> 00:08:30,598
are sort of like a game of telephone

231
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:32,219
like the guy that makes the bus says we

232
00:08:30,598 --> 00:08:34,439
found two grams of cannabis and the

233
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:35,969
sergeant says they found five grams of

234
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,649
cannabis and the whoever is ahead of

235
00:08:35,969 --> 00:08:39,149
them goes they found 12 grams of

236
00:08:37,649 --> 00:08:40,979
cannabis they report it to the police in

237
00:08:39,149 --> 00:08:43,320
the or the news and the news says they

238
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:45,930
found 24 pounds of cannabis you think it

239
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:47,879
goes like that quite often there was a

240
00:08:45,929 --> 00:08:51,599
lot more of that when we were coming out

241
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:53,820
okay um you'd get busted with a quarter

242
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:58,080
and then the report would say

243
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:59,310
fifteen and then the original charge you

244
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:03,480
face in court would be under an ounce

245
00:08:59,309 --> 00:09:08,909
and you're like hey wait a second but

246
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:10,830
now more it's the cops need a way to

247
00:09:08,909 --> 00:09:14,250
justify what they're doing and the

248
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:17,100
effort they're putting in and so they've

249
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:20,519
come up with a math problem that makes

250
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:24,149
any size marijuana bust look like darn

251
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:25,409
good police work and the math they use

252
00:09:24,149 --> 00:09:27,809
and they're happy to give this to

253
00:09:25,409 --> 00:09:30,089
reporters and reporters are universally

254
00:09:27,809 --> 00:09:32,219
too lazy to check this and it's really

255
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:33,840
easy to check now you just call a

256
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:39,029
marijuana grow and ask to speak to

257
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:41,940
someone um reporters unavailable but the

258
00:09:39,029 --> 00:09:45,409
the math the cops use is every single

259
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:48,180
marijuana plant every single one

260
00:09:45,409 --> 00:09:51,539
harvests one pound of usable product

261
00:09:48,179 --> 00:09:54,000
every 90 days every plant every plant

262
00:09:51,539 --> 00:09:55,860
every single plant these plants also use

263
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,360
every single one of them uses six

264
00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:00,750
gallons of water a day but that's a

265
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,550
whole nother one so but yeah that's

266
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:04,429
maybe worth it the cops tell the

267
00:10:02,549 --> 00:10:08,339
reporters over and over and over again

268
00:10:04,429 --> 00:10:11,579
one marijuana plant one pound of usable

269
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:16,110
product every 90 days any idiot can do

270
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:18,629
it doesn't is not that hard um every

271
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:20,190
grower I know is like yeah I'm growing

272
00:10:18,629 --> 00:10:21,899
the wrong genetics or something if that

273
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:25,860
is the case I've got all the wrong [ __ ]

274
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:27,659
in for the last several years the

275
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:31,139
sheriff's in Colorado then take it a

276
00:10:27,659 --> 00:10:32,819
step further and say and these growers

277
00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:36,210
were gonna haul it to Florida or New

278
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:39,300
York City where it was gonna sell for

279
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:41,850
three to four thousand a pound which

280
00:10:39,299 --> 00:10:43,949
that part of the math is it totally nuts

281
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:45,600
but they're leaving out a big piece of

282
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:47,220
the story which is why they have to

283
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,620
drive it so far to make that kind of

284
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:52,259
money on it because it wasn't that long

285
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:55,950
ago when a pound of marijuana cost that

286
00:10:52,259 --> 00:10:57,419
much here right it doesn't anymore and

287
00:10:55,950 --> 00:11:02,820
there's a reason for that that the cops

288
00:10:57,419 --> 00:11:05,219
do not want to talk about Wow but the

289
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,769
rate here is we got to get reporters to

290
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:09,160
check on

291
00:11:05,769 --> 00:11:12,308
and so I need a favor from the listening

292
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:15,850
community when you see marijuana news

293
00:11:12,308 --> 00:11:17,860
articles on social media please jump in

294
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:21,869
the comment section and very play at

295
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:25,209
least say hey news lady hey news guy

296
00:11:21,869 --> 00:11:26,980
anyway - check that math right and call

297
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:29,198
them out on their [ __ ] if we do this

298
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:31,389
enough reporters will start asking cops

299
00:11:29,198 --> 00:11:33,849
the question the reason they don't now

300
00:11:31,389 --> 00:11:37,568
is there's no one who gives a [ __ ] the

301
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:40,028
cops love to tell them the numbers much

302
00:11:37,568 --> 00:11:42,188
larger than it really is the reporter is

303
00:11:40,028 --> 00:11:44,318
happier to report on a million dollar

304
00:11:42,188 --> 00:11:49,238
drug bust versus a thousand dollar drug

305
00:11:44,318 --> 00:11:52,088
bust and everybody goes on pretending

306
00:11:49,239 --> 00:11:53,410
like this was some huge deal and no one

307
00:11:52,089 --> 00:11:54,579
calls him on their [ __ ] and it's

308
00:11:53,409 --> 00:11:57,278
starting to drive me nuts

309
00:11:54,578 --> 00:11:58,838
so when Jeff said we need a topic for

310
00:11:57,278 --> 00:12:02,198
the podcast what do you got I said I

311
00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:04,660
want a rat or rant about cop math and it

312
00:12:02,198 --> 00:12:06,178
was to haul these [ __ ] out so

313
00:12:04,659 --> 00:12:12,338
the first thing that I find hilarious

314
00:12:06,178 --> 00:12:14,948
one plant one pound 90 days yep man pull

315
00:12:12,339 --> 00:12:16,569
up the recent buses in Colorado they

316
00:12:14,948 --> 00:12:18,039
love laying the plants out in the

317
00:12:16,568 --> 00:12:21,878
driveway now I love those pin they're

318
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:23,139
all 18 to 24 inch tall veg plants that's

319
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:24,909
what they keep laying out in the

320
00:12:23,139 --> 00:12:28,119
driveway they're not throwing down a

321
00:12:24,909 --> 00:12:30,990
three gallon pot with a quarter pound

322
00:12:28,119 --> 00:12:34,028
you know of usable materials yes plant

323
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:36,428
their throne it's it's a four inch pot

324
00:12:34,028 --> 00:12:37,808
it's a 20 inch tall plant they're laying

325
00:12:36,428 --> 00:12:39,730
it down in the driveway and they're

326
00:12:37,808 --> 00:12:42,188
telling reporters straight-faced

327
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:42,909
that that plant drinks six gallons of

328
00:12:42,188 --> 00:12:46,748
water a day

329
00:12:42,909 --> 00:12:49,688
very not true is gonna produce a pound

330
00:12:46,749 --> 00:12:52,839
of usable Bud in 90 days very untrue and

331
00:12:49,688 --> 00:12:55,659
that that's super easy to make $3,000 a

332
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:58,269
pound on very untrue right it's three

333
00:12:55,659 --> 00:12:59,948
hardcore lies to the reporters space and

334
00:12:58,269 --> 00:13:03,339
the reporter goes thank you for lying to

335
00:12:59,948 --> 00:13:04,808
me officer and reports it is gospel and

336
00:13:03,339 --> 00:13:06,669
then the people that see it on the news

337
00:13:04,808 --> 00:13:09,308
that don't have any clue they believe it

338
00:13:06,668 --> 00:13:13,298
and then now they are on the that side

339
00:13:09,308 --> 00:13:14,230
they are on program inside and like at

340
00:13:13,298 --> 00:13:16,539
this point

341
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:16,980
cops lie everybody's used to it who

342
00:13:16,539 --> 00:13:18,838
gives

343
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:21,180
[ __ ] reporters are dumb and lazy who

344
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:23,370
gives a [ __ ] but this has real-world

345
00:13:21,179 --> 00:13:25,409
implications like in a certain point the

346
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:27,690
people who get charged with these busts

347
00:13:25,409 --> 00:13:32,219
end up in jail trying to explain to a

348
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:35,970
judge that the $1,500 the cops found was

349
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:39,180
three months profit and they're making

350
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:41,959
pennies and the cops are pretending that

351
00:13:39,179 --> 00:13:44,458
these guys are kingpins it's insane and

352
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:46,588
that's another thing that we were going

353
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:49,078
to segue into sort of is the value that

354
00:13:46,589 --> 00:13:50,790
they put on this stuff they say that

355
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:52,559
some of these busts are worth millions

356
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:54,389
of dollars they'll find a few pounds and

357
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:56,849
then try to exaggerate the the cost of

358
00:13:54,389 --> 00:13:58,320
the pounds where do they get those

359
00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:01,019
numbers did they just create it well

360
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,600
there's always a lot of information in

361
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:05,310
the reports that gives a lie or gives

362
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,709
away the lie that the reporter and the

363
00:14:05,309 --> 00:14:10,259
cop are trying to tell the reader if you

364
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:12,659
read between the lines you start asking

365
00:14:10,259 --> 00:14:15,389
yourself well the dude only has like 30

366
00:14:12,659 --> 00:14:18,120
plants in his basement he had 15 pounds

367
00:14:15,389 --> 00:14:20,568
of product stashed out that's like three

368
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:23,220
harvests worth of product he had on hand

369
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:25,919
why can't homeboy move his product any

370
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:27,990
faster than that if this is really worth

371
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:29,698
millions and millions of dollars and

372
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:31,560
it's a black market cash-only business

373
00:14:29,698 --> 00:14:34,439
why did [ __ ] nuts only have fifteen

374
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:36,088
hundred dollars in the house the cops

375
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:39,480
love to rant about all the guns they

376
00:14:36,089 --> 00:14:41,579
find but there's almost never a shot

377
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:43,139
fired during these raids because the

378
00:14:41,578 --> 00:14:46,799
cops aren't or the guns aren't for the

379
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:49,470
cops the guns are for the robbers that

380
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:51,359
the cops entice to go there by giving

381
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:53,339
these [ __ ] reports to war the guns

382
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,769
are just the guns because it's Colorado

383
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:57,149
and there are America yeah and sometimes

384
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:58,740
if you live in the right area you get a

385
00:14:57,149 --> 00:15:00,929
[ __ ] bear in your front yard you may

386
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:02,789
want a gun sometimes there's a real

387
00:15:00,929 --> 00:15:05,849
story in Colorado right now where a

388
00:15:02,789 --> 00:15:07,740
jogger was attacked by a mountain lion

389
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:09,350
and choked that [ __ ] thing to death

390
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:14,060
with his bare hands

391
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:16,920
hardcore I've seen people jogging on

392
00:15:14,059 --> 00:15:18,869
trails in Colorado with firearms because

393
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:22,610
there are wildlife that might attack

394
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:22,610
that's a real thing absolutely

395
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:28,059
but no one cares about the guns to put

396
00:15:26,019 --> 00:15:29,620
ween exilim it's just something to add

397
00:15:28,059 --> 00:15:32,049
to the report to make these people sound

398
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:34,870
dangerous sensationalism yep fear it

399
00:15:32,049 --> 00:15:36,669
sells yeah there's a lot of [ __ ] in

400
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:38,919
these reports and it just it shines

401
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:41,259
through to anyone with a slight clue and

402
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:43,689
it drives me nuts that that more people

403
00:15:41,259 --> 00:15:44,889
don't call this stuff out I think a lot

404
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:46,900
of times what they're trying to do if

405
00:15:44,889 --> 00:15:48,879
they find will say 5 pounds they try to

406
00:15:46,899 --> 00:15:51,159
break that down into grand price and

407
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:53,259
then they highly exaggerated grand price

408
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:55,089
and then they multiply however so

409
00:15:53,259 --> 00:15:57,309
however many grams times however many

410
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:58,330
pounds or however many pounds yeah they

411
00:15:57,309 --> 00:16:00,369
do the math and they said this many

412
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:02,830
dollars and they do it by grams at like

413
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:05,080
50 bucks a gram because at the very

414
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:07,300
smallest level somewhere that's

415
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:09,009
happening there's a $60 $50 gram happen

416
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:11,229
and somewhere I don't know where but

417
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:13,299
some some inner-city place I was gonna

418
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:14,680
say Baltimore I don't know but I was you

419
00:16:13,299 --> 00:16:16,269
know somewhere like that that I don't

420
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:17,500
know anybody I do I know what's up Josh

421
00:16:16,269 --> 00:16:20,889
if you're not gonna listen and sorry bro

422
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:22,509
but it's it it's maybe a huge commodity

423
00:16:20,889 --> 00:16:23,919
to get a gram all the way down to

424
00:16:22,509 --> 00:16:25,210
Baltimore or wherever you said or

425
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:26,500
Kentucky or whatever that's a little

426
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:29,740
effort you got to get it there it cost

427
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:31,690
more so 60 a gram then you multiply that

428
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:34,060
by a pound then you multiply that by

429
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:35,950
five pounds then it almost adds up to

430
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:37,359
their inflated numbers but they've got

431
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:41,200
to be gone with the most ridiculous

432
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:42,970
price it's they don't even try they they

433
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:45,640
just guess they made a wholesale number

434
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:46,899
that sounds big and scary yeah well if

435
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:48,610
they're doing it by the gram price

436
00:16:46,899 --> 00:16:50,559
nobody's making that chunk of money

437
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:52,240
there are so many hands it passes

438
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:54,579
through you got the guy that took it

439
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,980
from wherever from California reselling

440
00:16:54,580 --> 00:17:00,820
pounds by the gram is buying those

441
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:02,860
pounds wholesale a shitty price right

442
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:04,838
the guy delivering them probably made a

443
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:06,430
hundred a pound the guy that bottom

444
00:17:04,838 --> 00:17:08,049
probably the guy that sold him

445
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:09,459
originally made a hundred pound profit

446
00:17:08,049 --> 00:17:11,379
so by the time they get all the way down

447
00:17:09,459 --> 00:17:13,570
there there's one two three guys making

448
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:16,839
a hundred bucks each pound then they

449
00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:18,730
land into some guy who sells to the

450
00:17:16,838 --> 00:17:20,289
whole neighborhood he buys a pound of it

451
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:22,720
then it breaks down into probably

452
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:23,980
quarters eighths and then a couple of

453
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,289
guys buy quarters and eighths from or

454
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:28,660
ounces from him and probably sell grams

455
00:17:26,289 --> 00:17:29,950
out of bat there's not one person making

456
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:31,060
a whole [ __ ] Mountain the money off

457
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:33,130
of any of that right if you're

458
00:17:31,059 --> 00:17:34,599
unfamiliar with the process Jeff just

459
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:36,970
outlined

460
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:40,000
pull up the Union on YouTube it's a

461
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:41,980
movie called the Union it goes through

462
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,950
all of this it's that it I think it was

463
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:45,730
done in 2004 that's quite what it's it

464
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:48,910
still applies

465
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:51,250
it's literally exist it's the exact

466
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:53,500
model that's been used across the planet

467
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:54,730
for the last 20 years that's why I can

468
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,440
talk about it so easily because I

469
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:59,319
understand that economics let's figure

470
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:01,330
from here to here driving me nuts as the

471
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:03,639
reports I'm bitching about don't

472
00:18:01,329 --> 00:18:10,210
understand that process they think it's

473
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:13,120
new and there's no I I mean we've had

474
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:15,460
legal marijuana stores for five years

475
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:19,149
now in Colorado and there's still zero

476
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:21,819
effort to check on the numbers like they

477
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:23,259
don't even bother reporting the average

478
00:18:21,819 --> 00:18:25,210
market rate of wholesale pounds in

479
00:18:23,259 --> 00:18:28,779
Colorado which is a number they report

480
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:30,519
in other articles they just they

481
00:18:28,779 --> 00:18:33,730
immediately go to in all of this

482
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:36,460
marijuana we found in Albert County is

483
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:38,200
worth this much in Florida and so that's

484
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:40,419
we're calling the size of the bust and

485
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:44,259
it's like they had to drive it all the

486
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:45,730
way to Florida still yeah it's not if

487
00:18:44,259 --> 00:18:47,558
you have to take it somewhere to make it

488
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:51,579
worth something why are we pretending

489
00:18:47,558 --> 00:18:53,950
it's worth that now and [ __ ] alright

490
00:18:51,579 --> 00:18:57,879
that's my rant guys well that was Mike's

491
00:18:53,950 --> 00:19:00,069
rant about cop math I'll call these sons

492
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:01,510
of [ __ ] out Facebook Twitter wherever

493
00:19:00,069 --> 00:19:05,319
you can do it please

494
00:19:01,509 --> 00:19:09,009
or hit me up at nema 1-15 on twitter and

495
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:12,879
tell me no talk back to Mike that's all

496
00:19:09,009 --> 00:19:15,099
you want feedback at Mike um man I've

497
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,470
got two more notes left and they are on

498
00:19:15,099 --> 00:19:21,189
similar topics but the opposite Mike

499
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:22,839
saying call the cops out I learned Mike

500
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:25,538
saying to call the cops out but I wrote

501
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:26,769
down some other stuff if you're

502
00:19:25,538 --> 00:19:28,240
interacting with the cops they've only

503
00:19:26,769 --> 00:19:30,429
got about eight minutes to mess with you

504
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,150
that's it's about the average time of a

505
00:19:30,429 --> 00:19:33,240
traffic stop

506
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:35,860
eight minutes during that eight minutes

507
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:37,000
but I learned this summer I'm gonna give

508
00:19:35,859 --> 00:19:38,379
them a shot at the end of this during

509
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,119
that eight minutes their goal is to try

510
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:42,309
to get you to say something stupid so

511
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:43,928
that they can [ __ ] with you if they had

512
00:19:42,308 --> 00:19:45,039
a reason to arrest you they already

513
00:19:43,929 --> 00:19:46,990
would have gotten you out of the car

514
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:48,519
they're waiting for you to [ __ ] up or

515
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:49,749
they're just waiting for that ten

516
00:19:48,519 --> 00:19:51,338
five to come back and tell them that you

517
00:19:49,749 --> 00:19:52,479
got a warrant but if you don't have

518
00:19:51,338 --> 00:19:53,769
warrant if you don't have any problems

519
00:19:52,479 --> 00:19:55,899
they would have already gotten you out

520
00:19:53,769 --> 00:19:57,338
of the car so my best advice when you're

521
00:19:55,898 --> 00:19:59,168
dealing with law enforcement other than

522
00:19:57,338 --> 00:20:01,058
on the internet and calling them out for

523
00:19:59,169 --> 00:20:02,109
[ __ ] is to shut the [ __ ] up

524
00:20:01,058 --> 00:20:03,878
don't say anything when you're messing

525
00:20:02,108 --> 00:20:05,439
with the cops yes sir no sir and you

526
00:20:03,878 --> 00:20:07,178
don't have to answer these we're talking

527
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,759
about very different scenarios yeah I'm

528
00:20:07,179 --> 00:20:11,830
talking about asking listeners to call

529
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:14,169
[ __ ] on internet news stories see

530
00:20:11,829 --> 00:20:16,808
where cops are laughably wrong about pop

531
00:20:14,169 --> 00:20:18,879
math just talking about face-to-face

532
00:20:16,808 --> 00:20:23,378
interactions yes officers very different

533
00:20:18,878 --> 00:20:26,078
circumstances yes yes they're - help you

534
00:20:23,378 --> 00:20:27,578
they they can offer you no assistance in

535
00:20:26,078 --> 00:20:29,918
any way shape or form they're there to

536
00:20:27,578 --> 00:20:31,269
find a reason to take you to jail or to

537
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:33,820
leave you alone while they go look for

538
00:20:31,269 --> 00:20:35,858
someone else to take to jail think of it

539
00:20:33,819 --> 00:20:37,118
like a commission sales job they're

540
00:20:35,858 --> 00:20:38,949
gonna walk up to you they're gonna pitch

541
00:20:37,118 --> 00:20:40,238
you a product if you're not buying or in

542
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:41,739
eight minutes they're gonna try to find

543
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:43,328
somebody who's got a bigger wallet so

544
00:20:41,739 --> 00:20:45,098
that they can dig a little deeper and

545
00:20:43,328 --> 00:20:47,288
get something out of that wallet so

546
00:20:45,098 --> 00:20:49,298
we're with the law enforcement try to

547
00:20:47,288 --> 00:20:51,098
handle it out five seven maybe eight

548
00:20:49,298 --> 00:20:52,749
minutes most traffic stops will last you

549
00:20:51,098 --> 00:20:54,548
about five to eight minutes don't say

550
00:20:52,749 --> 00:20:56,078
anything stupid shut the [ __ ] up don't

551
00:20:54,548 --> 00:20:57,729
answer questions you don't have to talk

552
00:20:56,078 --> 00:20:59,259
about your day the best thing you can

553
00:20:57,729 --> 00:21:01,659
say is I don't really want to talk about

554
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:03,519

don't want to so don't do that

560
00:21:10,328 --> 00:21:13,178

your ground without it all being a dick

592
00:22:24,819 --> 00:22:29,500
right you are a civil person hopefully

593
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:31,330
the law enforcement in which you were

594
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:33,099
act interacting with is a civil dude

595
00:22:31,329 --> 00:22:35,109
don't go out of your way to be a dick

596
00:22:33,099 --> 00:22:38,319
then it's gonna go out of his way to be

597
00:22:35,109 --> 00:22:41,529
a dick most law enforcement are just men

598
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:43,929
with jobs trying to do right most there

599
00:22:41,529 --> 00:22:45,990
are a lot of [ __ ] [ __ ]

600
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:48,490
trust me but a lot of them are just

601
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:52,329
honorable men trying to do an honorable

602
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:55,390
job they've got rules to follow and they

603
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:57,579
want us to follow certain rules so don't

604
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:58,600
[ __ ] with them just I don't feel like

605
00:22:57,579 --> 00:23:00,399
discussing my day

606
00:22:58,599 --> 00:23:02,649
there's my paperwork do all the things

607
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:06,780
they ask for comply but don't poke the

608
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:09,640
bear there's no need to poke the bear

609
00:23:06,779 --> 00:23:12,940
exactly another thing I really think

610
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:15,280
it's time that I if the police are going

611
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:18,220
to expect me to follow all these rules

612
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:19,629
and if I do one stupid thing wrong they

613
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:21,460
can pull me over they can [ __ ] with my

614
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:22,930
whole day possibly ruin my entire life

615
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:25,210
based on a few decisions that they

616
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:28,750
decide to make that day just depends on

617
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:30,940
it's all situational who knows ah I wish

618
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:35,559
they would be held accountable and some

619
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:37,720
police oh whatever I feel the urge or

620
00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:39,309
need to like whenever it's a legitimate

621
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:41,289
thing that gets of a safety thing or

622
00:23:39,309 --> 00:23:43,299
it's a cop goes bomb and behind me to

623
00:23:41,289 --> 00:23:44,589
Hunter with no lights on I'll call State

624
00:23:43,299 --> 00:23:48,309
Patrol and be like there's a white

625
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:52,659
charger doing 110 up i-25 their license

626
00:23:48,309 --> 00:23:54,579
plate is welcome there was a dude like a

627
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:56,620
state trooper that like to park in the

628
00:23:54,579 --> 00:23:58,329
median on a highway you and I drive all

629
00:23:56,619 --> 00:23:59,769
the time dude that cop is scared the

630
00:23:58,329 --> 00:24:01,659
[ __ ] out of me a couple of times because

631
00:23:59,769 --> 00:24:03,430
that's a terrible spot okay so it's a

632
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:04,990
it's a divided highway folks

633
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:06,670
so there's lanes on the right there's

634
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:08,829
lanes on the left there's a green belt

635
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:11,019
in the middle there's an intersection

636
00:24:08,829 --> 00:24:13,210
across this so there's a stoplight

637
00:24:11,019 --> 00:24:15,519
there's like nine lanes and moving

638
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:15,788
traffic and [ __ ] would park and

639
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:19,058
kind of

640
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:21,278
hard to spots hard to see spot facing in

641
00:24:19,058 --> 00:24:24,418
a directions so that he could not

642
00:24:21,278 --> 00:24:27,729
legally drive into a lane of traffic

643
00:24:24,419 --> 00:24:30,249
without doing so in a way that was blind

644
00:24:27,729 --> 00:24:31,808
to the drivers supposed to be heading to

645
00:24:30,249 --> 00:24:34,389
where he was I'm not explaining this

646
00:24:31,808 --> 00:24:36,608
well good night um he was in a [ __ ]

647
00:24:34,388 --> 00:24:39,548
spot if this [ __ ] cop pulled out

648
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:41,678
after anybody the odds he created an

649
00:24:39,548 --> 00:24:43,599
accident were a hundred percent also

650
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:45,609
coming up when you're approaching an

651
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:47,228
intersection if you drive at all like me

652
00:24:45,608 --> 00:24:48,908
I'm scanning that intersection before I

653
00:24:47,229 --> 00:24:50,710
come up to it so I can see if anybody's

654
00:24:48,909 --> 00:24:52,119
gonna turn in front of me sure I could

655
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:53,858
see if anybody's gonna pull out from

656
00:24:52,118 --> 00:24:56,348
just run the red light and t-boned me

657
00:24:53,858 --> 00:24:58,118
I'm kind of scanning that cop would park

658
00:24:56,348 --> 00:24:59,499
in such a way that he would just disrupt

659
00:24:58,118 --> 00:25:00,668
my view of everything and I would have

660
00:24:59,499 --> 00:25:02,470
to hit the brakes be like what the [ __ ]

661
00:25:00,669 --> 00:25:03,849
is that weird car doing in the middle

662
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:05,440
because you're not gonna hit him because

663
00:25:03,848 --> 00:25:09,069
the way the lanes are aligned you'll go

664
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:10,570
right around him but he's he's a weird

665
00:25:09,069 --> 00:25:11,950
obstruction of your view you're

666
00:25:10,569 --> 00:25:13,509
wondering why there's a vehicle where

667
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:15,460
there shouldn't be a vehicle you start

668
00:25:13,509 --> 00:25:17,169
looking at that vehicle instead of where

669
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:18,340
you should be you should be looking at

670
00:25:17,169 --> 00:25:19,690
the lights you should be looking at the

671
00:25:18,339 --> 00:25:21,158
lane instead you're going what is that

672
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:29,019
is that moving is it parked am I gonna

673
00:25:21,159 --> 00:25:30,909
hit it is it coming at me right yeah so

674
00:25:29,019 --> 00:25:32,710
it's really it's more of a hazard they

675
00:25:30,909 --> 00:25:35,169
sort of help you could every time I

676
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:37,329
would see that [ __ ] and this happened

677
00:25:35,169 --> 00:25:38,830
a half dozen times over like a four

678
00:25:37,329 --> 00:25:41,558
month period before you stop parking

679
00:25:38,829 --> 00:25:44,678
there I would call the non-emergency

680
00:25:41,558 --> 00:25:47,079
number for State Patrol and say there's

681
00:25:44,679 --> 00:25:48,849
a disabled charger in the spot and after

682
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:51,220
the first couple of calls I just gave up

683
00:25:48,848 --> 00:25:53,589
the disabled car ruse and just said okay

684
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:56,200
so that I know you guys don't tell them

685
00:25:53,589 --> 00:25:57,878
where to park but if this dude pulls out

686
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:00,038
in a hurry for any reason he's gonna get

687
00:25:57,878 --> 00:26:01,658
hurt or kill someone it's a tear out

688
00:26:00,038 --> 00:26:03,009
like someone needs to talk to the city

689
00:26:01,659 --> 00:26:04,419
it and be like okay I get that you're

690
00:26:03,009 --> 00:26:07,538
trying to use sneaky to speed

691
00:26:04,419 --> 00:26:08,470
enforcement Park someone where somewhere

692
00:26:07,538 --> 00:26:12,970
where you're not gonna kill people

693
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:15,548
pulling out yeah it's just a homeboy on

694
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:17,139
Park there no more but there's there's

695
00:26:15,548 --> 00:26:19,658
absolutely no rule that says you can't

696
00:26:17,138 --> 00:26:21,758
call the cops on the cops and I think if

697
00:26:19,659 --> 00:26:24,009
more people did this more often it would

698
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:25,450
solve a couple of things hey that's how

699
00:26:24,009 --> 00:26:26,140
we got them to stop running around

700
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:28,509
everywhere

701
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:31,240
100 miles an hour look when we were kids

702
00:26:28,509 --> 00:26:34,089
that [ __ ] was common now your girls

703
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:36,130
never see I grew up just a city oh I

704
00:26:34,089 --> 00:26:37,480
grew up on Compton Boulevard literally

705
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:39,040
like the street at the end of my block

706
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:40,569
was Compton Boulevard do you want to

707
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:43,690
talk about seeing some police chases

708
00:26:40,569 --> 00:26:46,569
dude I grew up in white bread land and

709
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:49,779
suburbia in cops used to have the run of

710
00:26:46,569 --> 00:26:53,439
the place and no one ever said you know

711
00:26:49,779 --> 00:26:55,329
if we can't do 55 there you why are you

712
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,070
doing 80 with your without the lights

713
00:26:55,329 --> 00:27:00,789
and sirens yeah you're gonna if you're

714
00:26:57,069 --> 00:27:02,289
on your way to stop crime like okay but

715
00:27:00,789 --> 00:27:04,420
if you're on your way to lunch you're

716
00:27:02,289 --> 00:27:06,430
back to the office like inappropriate

717
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:08,680
and dangerous right because it is for me

718
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:10,779
I'm special my kid plays in this

719
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:12,970
neighborhood you can't hit him enough

720
00:27:10,779 --> 00:27:15,549
people took those complaints public that

721
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:17,049
a bunch of rules and laws got past and

722
00:27:15,549 --> 00:27:19,389
now cops can get in all kinds of trouble

723
00:27:17,049 --> 00:27:22,480
if they get caught flipping their lights

724
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:25,120
on to jump red lights or speeding up and

725
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:26,710
down the highway you can even pull video

726
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:28,449
on YouTube with cops pulling other cops

727
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:31,450
over for speed and that's good just

728
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:34,539
roasting them for it it's good there's a

729
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:37,509
weird duality with our our thoughts and

730
00:27:34,539 --> 00:27:41,019
actions and kind of views on the police

731
00:27:37,509 --> 00:27:43,059
on the one hand we kind of embrace a

732
00:27:41,019 --> 00:27:45,339
[ __ ] the police culture is sort of a

733
00:27:43,059 --> 00:27:48,009
community it's a general societal

734
00:27:45,339 --> 00:27:50,139
feeling and on the other hand there are

735
00:27:48,009 --> 00:27:52,450
endless cop shows and there's the real

736
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:54,340
follow the cops around while they stop

737
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:56,289
criminals type cops type shows that

738
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:59,589
you're talking about but there's also a

739
00:27:56,289 --> 00:28:01,389
thousand dramas where it's it's it's

740
00:27:59,589 --> 00:28:04,329
scripted television yeah it's not legit

741
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:06,130
at all but the lead characters are cops

742
00:28:04,329 --> 00:28:09,699
we're following cops around the whole

743
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:11,530
plot is cops get bad guy justice served

744
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:14,950
that's always been one of the best of

745
00:28:11,529 --> 00:28:17,349
genres but even millions of Americans

746
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:19,960
watch cop shows and Sharon root for the

747
00:28:17,349 --> 00:28:22,569
cops and the difference between the cops

748
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:25,630
we interact with on in the real world

749
00:28:22,569 --> 00:28:28,689
and the cops on TV is that nine times

750
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:31,000
out of ten the cops on TV when one of

751
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:34,000
the cops on TV goes imma break the law

752
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:36,039
the other cops on TV go no you're not

753
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,009
that's a crime you're getting in trouble

754
00:28:36,039 --> 00:28:39,609
to it in reality we see all the other

755
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:44,079
cops go

756
00:28:39,609 --> 00:28:45,759
then blue line and I honestly think

757
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:47,849
that's where the disconnect comes in

758
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:49,930
because we don't see enough

759
00:28:47,849 --> 00:28:55,029
accountability and amongst those

760
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:56,860
populations peer pressure I know this

761
00:28:55,029 --> 00:28:58,960
this show took a weird turn it did but I

762
00:28:56,859 --> 00:29:00,339
like those weird turns they like it when

763
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,590
we remembe oh I think the audience likes

764
00:29:00,339 --> 00:29:06,189
the the weird turns they'd like to come

765
00:29:02,589 --> 00:29:08,649
get stoned with us I think cameras have

766
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:10,890
had a lot of influence on law

767
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:13,060
enforcement interaction on both sides

768
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:14,980
sometimes I believe people are

769
00:29:13,059 --> 00:29:16,269
performing for the camera when

770
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:18,490
interacting with law enforcement a

771
00:29:16,269 --> 00:29:21,759
little too much we spoke earlier on the

772
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:23,259
first year to people the department's

773
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:24,940
putting the cameras and complaints on

774
00:29:23,259 --> 00:29:26,769
both sides fell like sixty or eighty

775
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:28,090
percent yeah yeah I'm not just saying

776
00:29:26,769 --> 00:29:29,349
the people that those guys had sitting

777
00:29:28,089 --> 00:29:30,759
there I know my rights I'm not getting

778
00:29:29,349 --> 00:29:32,019
out of the car so those are a little

779
00:29:30,759 --> 00:29:34,569
extreme I'm thinking like some of the

780
00:29:32,019 --> 00:29:36,910
people that get a little ridiculous with

781
00:29:34,569 --> 00:29:38,740
the police like physical and act like a

782
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:39,490
[ __ ] complete [ __ ] on camera I

783
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:40,779
think some of those people are just

784
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:42,579
showing off because we have too many

785
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:43,779
cameras now but also I think it does

786
00:29:42,579 --> 00:29:45,609
like you said it makes a lot of

787
00:29:43,779 --> 00:29:48,220
accountability a lot you can't go

788
00:29:45,609 --> 00:29:49,539
anywhere around here you got to go out

789
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:50,589
to the sticks or somewhere to not be on

790
00:29:49,539 --> 00:29:52,450
camera and then you're probably on a

791
00:29:50,589 --> 00:29:54,819
[ __ ] trail cam also out there right

792
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:57,160
yeah cameras everywhere the addition of

793
00:29:54,819 --> 00:29:59,500
the the body cam for a lot of police

794
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:01,720
departments is just drastically drop the

795
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:03,069
number of complaints on both sides if

796
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:04,720
you're not already on camera Tony's

797
00:30:03,069 --> 00:30:06,849
probably flying a drone around finding

798
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:09,549
you with it right it's not a security

799
00:30:06,849 --> 00:30:12,939
camera is to drone or a private camera

800
00:30:09,549 --> 00:30:15,069
doorbell camera or I'm just waiting so

801
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:16,720
we've all got one on our foreheads we

802
00:30:15,069 --> 00:30:19,539
just scan and everything all day

803
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:22,750
recording recording that's what glasses

804
00:30:19,539 --> 00:30:24,339
before a poll just barely though just

805
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:27,009
barely so we're all gonna be just human

806
00:30:24,339 --> 00:30:28,359
Tesla's basically autopilot all day we

807
00:30:27,009 --> 00:30:31,660
basically are with the phone in her hand

808
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:33,699
worst on autopilot yeah it's the phone's

809
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:35,430
not new it's just the new thing right

810
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:38,500
before it was the phone it was the paper

811
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:40,570
the newspaper yep yeah I remember that

812
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:43,029
my grandpa had the newspaper to his face

813
00:30:40,569 --> 00:30:44,019
constantly mm-hmm yep the

814
00:30:43,029 --> 00:30:45,579
just holding it there so that nobody

815
00:30:44,019 --> 00:30:47,139
would talk to him couldn't take that

816
00:30:45,579 --> 00:30:48,879
long to read the [ __ ] newspaper it

817
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:50,740
was a great way to tell everyone else in

818
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:53,680
the room to shut the [ __ ] this biggest

819
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:55,660
three foot go [ __ ] yourself in the way

820
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:57,160

821
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:59,860
told everyone around you hey shut the

822
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:01,360
[ __ ] up I'm about to read it it creates

823
00:30:59,859 --> 00:31:02,679
this like little barrier around you

824
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:04,119
there's no eye contact it looks just

825
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:07,840
like the iPad except it doesn't light up

826
00:31:04,119 --> 00:31:09,669
at you yeah awesome all right Michael

827
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:11,139
we've got plenty of material to wear

828
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:13,050
even once I edit out the weird [ __ ]

829
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:15,490
we'll still have a quality podcast here

830
00:31:13,049 --> 00:31:17,259
let's make it better and let's take some

831
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:19,690
dabs and see where the conversation goes

832
00:31:17,259 --> 00:31:23,559
well what's that random request I had

833
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:24,880
for the listeners that I said I wanted

834
00:31:23,559 --> 00:31:26,980
to ask earlier now I don't remember

835
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:28,150
I totally don't rewrite you're asking me

836
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:30,220
to remember stuff and we've been taking

837
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:35,440
dads I've had a really long between dabs

838
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:36,730
1 &amp; 2 see now you're creating more

839
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:39,549
editing but that's okay

840
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:42,610
I don't remember let's take some dabs of

841
00:31:39,549 --> 00:31:43,960
the let's hit the fluffernutter I think

842
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:45,969

843
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:48,940
do it the stuff is tasty I really like

844
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:52,420
if the container says it is 74.6 2

845
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:54,190
percent THC alright I just heated up

846
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:56,039
this nail way too hot so I'm gonna let

847
00:31:54,190 --> 00:32:01,840
it cool then I'm gonna hit this this

848
00:31:56,039 --> 00:32:02,769
fluffernutter from contraband yeah I'm

849
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:05,339
trying to think how to describe the

850
00:32:02,769 --> 00:32:07,329
flavor it's sweet it's sharp it's a

851
00:32:05,339 --> 00:32:09,639
candy dryer sheets

852
00:32:07,329 --> 00:32:11,669
I remember the question let's hear your

853
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:15,370
question Mike all right listen gonna dab

854
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:18,160
so the terminology that I've always

855
00:32:15,369 --> 00:32:20,979
heard for the leftover smoke in a bong

856
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:23,080
hit so you go to take a bong hit you

857
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:26,039
don't clay clear it that leftover smoke

858
00:32:23,079 --> 00:32:29,049
is referred to as a buffalo fart I'm

859
00:32:26,039 --> 00:32:31,269
sure this has regional variations which

860
00:32:29,049 --> 00:32:35,829
I would love to hear tweet me at nema

861
00:32:31,269 --> 00:32:37,539
1-15 the question is is a what do you

862
00:32:35,829 --> 00:32:40,689
call the leftover bomb smoke in your

863
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:44,399
area and be is there a different term

864
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:46,830
for the leftover vapor and add a brick

865
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:49,110
that is the question please tweet

866
00:32:46,829 --> 00:32:50,699
answers when we originally talked about

867
00:32:49,109 --> 00:32:52,169
this earlier I didn't remember the term

868
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:53,880
that we used it just came to me as I was

869
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:55,410
dabbing see people say that dabbing

870
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:58,559
might be bad for your memory no it

871
00:32:55,410 --> 00:33:00,269
brought [ __ ] back what was I gonna say

872
00:32:58,558 --> 00:33:02,970
nobody's getting a we used to call hat

873
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:04,500
Reba the smoker Yvonne rebonding the

874
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:06,660
smoke that's left in the bong is reborn

875
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:09,450
and then my buddy Josh would grab it and

876
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:11,160
blow into the downstem to blow air into

877
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:12,900
it to get that smoke out it's the only

878
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:14,220
way to safely clear a buffalo and then

879
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:16,309
one day I told him I said bro I think

880
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:18,420
I'd rather have Reebok than rebreathe

881
00:33:16,308 --> 00:33:19,470
and we all thought about that for a

882
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:20,730
couple of minutes and I was like I think

883
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:22,319
I'm just gonna blow it on myself every

884
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:24,329
time now and still let you blow it out

885
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:26,759
or somebody else blow out the Reebok for

886
00:33:24,329 --> 00:33:29,069
me so Reebok from when where I'm from

887
00:33:26,759 --> 00:33:30,539
buffalo fart is where mike is from what

888
00:33:29,069 --> 00:33:33,149
do you call that stale smoke left in the

889
00:33:30,539 --> 00:33:34,799
bong also how do you get that [ __ ] out

890
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:36,960
of that what is your approach you gotta

891
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:39,450
blow through the downstem otherwise you

892
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:42,090
end up with smoke and then you coughed

893
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:45,029
you died how do you been or how do you

894
00:33:42,089 --> 00:33:46,649
feel about real um well you just go

895
00:33:45,029 --> 00:33:48,240
through the downstem to clear the smoke

896
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:50,250
then you turn the bong around to hit it

897
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,079
normal and refill it with normal air

898
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:54,869
before you pass it along don't be a

899
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:58,529
[ __ ] Savage don't be a caveman about

900

call a buffalo fart or rebound where

904
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:12,269
you're from then question number two or

905
00:34:07,049 --> 00:34:13,769
Part B or addendum a will be Mike being

906

907

908

is left in the rig after you take a big

909
00:34:18,628 --> 00:34:21,539
dab and you can't clear it you just give

910
00:34:20,398 --> 00:34:22,799
up and you set it down and there's a

911
00:34:21,539 --> 00:34:23,878
little smoke sitting in there like mines

912
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,019
got going on right now because I don't

913

928
00:34:58,199 --> 00:35:02,399
just one button I used to get wild and

929
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,250
start promising ludicrous things I'm a

930
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:07,260
stick with the ludicrous or unlooted

931
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:08,670
Chris things odd so by sticking with

932
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:10,200
ludicrous things means you're gonna make

933
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:11,970
huge promises and under-deliver

934
00:35:10,199 --> 00:35:18,480
yep that seems to be a ludicrous thing

935
00:35:11,969 --> 00:35:21,149
hashtag fire fest I was looking for my

936
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:23,280
my brain sort of resin clog on like

937
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:24,119
there's underwhelmed and overwhelmed but

938
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,820
there isn't a whelmed

939
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:29,910
and I said ludicrous in my brain went

940
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:31,859
like Chris isn't a word I think it just

941
00:35:29,909 --> 00:35:34,139
kind of froze there for a second Wow

942
00:35:31,858 --> 00:35:36,210
yeah dabs don't open up pathways and

943
00:35:34,139 --> 00:35:37,769
everybody sometimes they clog them I had

944
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:39,900
something else I was gonna say oh I was

945
00:35:37,769 --> 00:35:42,449
