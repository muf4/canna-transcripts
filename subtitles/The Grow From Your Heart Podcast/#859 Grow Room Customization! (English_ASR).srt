spam folder because you've got a coupon

72

code for a free pack of seeds at idirect

73
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:59,120
tocom one more rambly piece of info

74
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:01,120
before I jump into this question if I do

75
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,480
send you a gift certificate or a coupon

76
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,480
code for free seeds at IR

77
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,319
redirect.sh that coupon code there are a

78
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:23,599
couple of reasons for that mostly

79
00:03:21,318 --> 00:03:25,199
logistic reasons um I don't like having

80
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:27,359
gift certificates just out floating in

81
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:29,079
The Ether and owing people uh money

82
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,040
essentially owing you seeds off of my

83
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,840
website it makes it challenging to keep

84
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:34,719
inventory it makes challenging it makes

85
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,759
it challenging to predict some things I

86
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:39,158
need those to expire so that means I

87
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:41,158
need you to use those gift certificates

88
00:03:39,158 --> 00:03:43,639
uh before they do expire so please when

89
00:03:41,158 --> 00:03:45,199
you see that expiration date uh please

90
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:47,000
use that promptly because I do get

91
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:49,199
emails people saying hey I didn't use my

92
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,400
gift card it expired can you replace it

93
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:53,318
unfortunately I cannot and will not do

94
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,239
that uh there are a couple of logistical

95
00:03:53,318 --> 00:03:56,598
reasons behind that first of all it

96
00:03:55,239 --> 00:03:58,280
tells me you did not listen to the

97
00:03:56,598 --> 00:04:00,679
podcast I tell you hey you got a coupon

98
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:02,239
code for seeds go use it um if you

99
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,560
listen to the show you probably heard it

100
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,920
you got excited you went and bought

101
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,959
seeds if not you simply were not excited

102
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:09,078
enough you didn't hear the show you

103
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,878
didn't go grab the beans I understand

104
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:13,079
maybe you don't need seeds right now but

105
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:14,318
go get them um so it tells me you didn't

106
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:15,959
listen to the episode and it tells me

107
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:18,159
you didn't go get your seeds but I need

108
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:20,079
those to expire like I said for logistic

109
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,280
reasons and logistic purposes so please

110
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,560
use them uh before they do expire that's

111
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:26,000
all I'm going to ramble about that that

112
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:28,319
was a side note a side quest if you will

113
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,720

130
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:07,159

131
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,240
evening as I was getting in my veg tent

132
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:12,919
and my question is what non-growing

133
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,400
related items do you use in your grow to

134
00:05:12,918 --> 00:05:16,719
help you out this is a really good

135
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:19,239
question it said I really like using zip

136
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,880
ties for all sorts of situations that

137
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:23,680
probably when I shop outside of the grow

138
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:25,879
store for Stuff zip ties are one of the

139
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,600
first things I buy I buy a lot of zip

140
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:29,079
ties I use them I got ducting hanging

141
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,439
from a ceiling I put an ey hook in the

142
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:33,680
ceiling use zip tie to keep it in place

143
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:35,600
lots of zip ties going on it goes on it

144
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,959
says I would love to hear what you use

145
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:42,840
daily or longterm bless up my friend

146
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:44,120
from dcoms or decom dcoms I'm not sure

147
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:46,519
how to say it bro but I still love and

148
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:48,519
respect you either way um so let's talk

149
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:50,639
about some of the things that I may use

150
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:53,478
for my grow that are not necessarily

151
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:56,560
designed or created or intended or sold

152
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:59,000
as grow room items everything we buy for

153
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,319
the grow is more expensive because the

154
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,399
people that made it and the people that

155
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,080
sold it to us know we're going to grow

156
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:06,478
cannabis with it so they just charge us

157
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:09,279
extra for it any cannabis growing item

158
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:10,359
cost 10 20% more than it should simply

159
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:12,399
because they know what we were going to

160
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:14,800
do with it if it wasn't for growing the

161
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:16,839
same exact freaking item would be 10 20%

162
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,000
cheaper uh you can go get it almost

163
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:20,598
every store except it's a specialized

164
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,800
item so they mark it up just because

165
00:06:20,598 --> 00:06:24,199
they know what we're going to do which

166
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:26,400
is unfair but it's America that's how

167
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:28,120
some [ __ ] works so there are many items

168
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:29,918
we can buy that don't come from the grow

169
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:32,120
store that you can get at your big Box

170
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:34,799
Store maybe a local Mom and Pop shop

171
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:36,598
that will help us in our Grow rooms um

172
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,038
I've got a short list here let's just

173
00:06:36,598 --> 00:06:40,680
talk about things that are not

174
00:06:38,038 --> 00:06:43,240
necessarily grow room specific devices

175
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:45,800
that I rely on and do use the first

176
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:47,519
thing on my list was door security um

177
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,319
I've got a little sensor thing it just

178
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:51,000
it's got one piece and another piece one

179
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:52,919
goes on the door frame one goes on the

180
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,160
door it's got a magnet on it when they

181
00:06:52,918 --> 00:06:56,878
click together this little dot turns off

182
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:59,160
when they unclick the Red Dot lights up

183
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:01,639
and I get a notification on my phone uh

184
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:03,919
door sensors door alarms I love it if my

185
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:05,560
grow room doors open I know it my phone

186
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:07,560
beeps and I go who the [ __ ] is in my

187
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:10,240
grow room the next thing that goes with

188
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,800
that wise cameras I really like cameras

189
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,519
in the grow so if that thing beeps and

190
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,759
says hey there's someone around I can

191
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:18,159
look and see who the [ __ ] is around I

192
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:20,560
keep uh so I've got a pretty decent

193
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,840
sized grow room with multiple tents in

194
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,439
that room I've got a camera in each tent

195
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:26,000
the veg and the flower and I like to

196
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:28,360
have a camera in the main part of the

197
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,680
room as well so I can see if there's uh

198
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:31,360
we'll talk about another thing here in a

199
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,519
second but I can see what's going on in

200
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,000
that room so if I do get a notification

201
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:37,120
then I can open up the cameras and I can

202
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,478
look and see what's happening um another

203
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,000
thing I'm going to talk about am I going

204
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:41,560
in order because I don't know if I am

205
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,800
I'm going to skip something one thing

206
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:45,478
that just came to my mind to tell you

207
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,680
about is water sensors and all of your

208
00:07:45,478 --> 00:07:50,279
hardware stores even on Amazon you can

209
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,280
buy water and moisture sensors so if

210
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:54,079
you're running a reservoir or if you're

211
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:55,839
running anything that automatically

212
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:57,519
fills up you've got an RO system you've

213
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:59,519
got water running to that constantly it

214
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:01,198
fills up it's filling a reservoir you

215
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:03,878
should have a float valve to make that

216
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,560
stop sometimes that will fail that float

217
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:07,080
valve is going to [ __ ] up one time

218
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,560
you're going to get water all over the

219
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:10,120
floor if you're gone you're at work

220
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,918
you're on vacation maybe you're out

221
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,199
running errands whatever you're doing uh

222
00:08:11,918 --> 00:08:14,878
maybe you went to get some tacos

223
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,560
everyone loves tacos but whatever you're

224
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,400
out doing if you've got a moisture

225
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,598
sensor on the floor where moisture

226
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:22,079
should not get to when water hits that

227
00:08:20,598 --> 00:08:23,839
guess what your phone's going to ding

228
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:25,719
you're going to get a notification pull

229
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:27,560
out your phone open your way cameras or

230
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:29,759
your wise cameras and look to see is

231
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:31,399
there water somewhere uh that water

232
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,240
sensor will ding your phone and let you

233
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:35,399
know hey there's water in places it

234
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:37,759
shouldn't be I use those in my Grove but

235
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:39,240
I also have a leaky pipe in my basement

236
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:41,838
uh there's an area that is known to kind

237
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,479
of cause a problem so anytime water

238
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,200
starts to happen there that [ __ ]

239
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:47,519
moisture sensor goes off and tells me so

240
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,360
that if I'm sleeping if I'm across town

241
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,959
if I'm at the store uh if I'm at the

242
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,600
sneaker shop I could just get right back

243
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:54,679
to where the grow is either one of the

244
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,560
grows and I can fix that water and not

245
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:59,120
cause more problems because water can

246
00:08:56,559 --> 00:09:00,838
really destroy some [ __ ] so door

247
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,240
security is one of the first things I

248
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:05,160
like uh water sensors and cameras are

249
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:07,159
things that I really like then let's

250
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:09,319
work on another really important thing

251
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:11,679
smoke detectors I really like some sort

252
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:13,320
of smoke detection we've got a lot of

253
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:15,399
electricity going on in that room even

254
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,959
if you just have one light and a fan

255
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:18,480
that's a lot of electricity running in a

256
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:20,599
growroom I don't know if it's in a

257
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,920
closet a bedroom or whatever but we

258
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:24,399
don't want to be the person that causes

259
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:26,399
a fire in the neighborhood because we

260
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,559
were cultivating cannabis that's a

261
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,039
really bad look on the entire Community

262
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:31,639
it's a bad look on the plant that's a

263
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:33,838
rough look my dude so don't be the

264
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:36,600
person uh catching a fire starting a

265
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:39,079
fire in your cultivation room um

266
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:41,399
especially in a residential area so I

267
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:43,039
recommend a smoke detector that way if

268
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:44,958
something does happen you could put that

269
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:46,639
[ __ ] out as quickly as possible how you

270
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:48,159
going to do that with the next piece of

271
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:50,720
advice I recommend the next piece of

272
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:52,319
equipment would be a fire extinguisher

273
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,600
that's right have a fire extinguisher

274
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,360
outside of the grow space uh if you walk

275
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,560
up to my main grow room right outside on

276
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,879
the floor I know it's on the floor I

277
00:09:57,559 --> 00:10:00,919
could kick it and trip it where it is I

278
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:02,240
won't but there is a fire extinguisher

279
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:03,679
right on the floor if some [ __ ] goes

280
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,680
wrong I can pick up the fire

281
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:07,599
extinguisher pull the pen kick the door

282
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:09,239
like the [ __ ] FBI and go in and just

283
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,159
start spraying and praying and handle

284
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:13,519
some [ __ ] so um where are we so far door

285
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:15,759
security you want to know if people come

286
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,799
and go um if they come and go you want a

287
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:20,319
camera so you can look at them um if

288
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:22,000
[ __ ] floods you want a water sensor also

289
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,000
when that water sensor goes off look at

290
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,399
the cameras that's pretty simple smoke

291
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,240
alarm we want to know if a fire happens

292
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,839
I don't have a smoke alarm that hooks up

293
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,200
to my phone it's simply

294
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,760
[ __ ] loud hopefully I'm here or there

295
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,360
or wherever the fire happens hopefully

296
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:37,720
there's no fire to be honest with you

297
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,480
but um do they make and sell a smoke

298
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,920
detector that hooks up to your phone yet

299
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,720
that should be something you know what's

300
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:45,039
going to happen my AC Infinity monitor

301
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,079
is going to let me know it's 170,000

302
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:49,000
degrees in there it will be B tell me so

303
00:10:47,078 --> 00:10:50,958
we do have some sort of fire warning if

304
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,440
we are away so we got a smoke detector

305
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:54,559
we got a fire extinguisher um now we're

306
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,279
just going to work our way into other

307
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:58,078
random those are big things I thought we

308
00:10:56,278 --> 00:11:00,200
should definitely cover safety safety is

309
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:02,078
important Safety and Security

310
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,399
um door locks do you have good locks on

311
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:05,439
your doors that's more [ __ ] to think

312
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:07,958
about I did not even write down locking

313
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:10,680
door knobs those are important but then

314
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:12,159
I really like the spin mop the Spin Mop

315
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:14,199
is just another random fun thing that

316
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:16,480
I've bought for my grow uh it's got the

317
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:18,200
thing that spins inside of it so you use

318
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,480
the mop you get that [ __ ] dirty and then

319
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,839
you stick it in the one part and you hit

320
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,800
the pedal and it spins the thing around

321
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:24,560
and cleans your mop for you I really

322
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:26,319
like the Spin Mop they don't I don't

323
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:28,278
work for Spin Mop I don't work I don't

324
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,399
nobody pays me to advertise except IE

325
00:11:28,278 --> 00:11:32,078
genetics cuz I own the damn company but

326
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,120
Spin Mop is a great [ __ ] product it's

327
00:11:32,078 --> 00:11:35,799
fun it's cheap and it it makes things

328

334
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,200
if you have easier gear to access and

335
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:50,120
use you're more likely to use it so the

336
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:52,920
Spin Mop that was a fun uh little

337
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:54,919
investment also something I use a whole

338
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:57,240
bunch in the grow space is a doctor

339
00:11:54,919 --> 00:11:59,439
stool if you got that little rollable uh

340
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,000
rolling adjustable doctor stool that

341
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,240
will save your back that'll save your

342
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,480
legs um sometimes I'm just scooting all

343
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,560
the way across the floor I don't want to

344
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,600
stand up and go over there to get the

345
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:09,319
scissors and come back I'll roll my high

346
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,200
ass right across the floor get them

347
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:13,560
launch myself right back but that doctor

348
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,320
stool really helps a lot I don't need to

349
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:17,638
be standing all day I don't need to be

350
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:19,760
hunched over and bent over little doctor

351
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:21,159
stool makes things a lot easier for me

352
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:23,278
there are a lot of options I like the

353
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:25,480
doctor stool uh works great for what I'm

354
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:28,120
trying to do uh the next thing that I

355
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:30,639
use a whole bunch in my grow space and

356
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:32,639
this is not grow related but how I said

357
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:33,759
if you enjoy being in there you'll be in

358
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,000
there more which some of you just need

359
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:36,919
to get the [ __ ] out of the grow and quit

360
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,720
messing with the plants but if there's

361
00:12:36,919 --> 00:12:41,319
work to do like popping twisting

362
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,800
lollipopping defoliating uh working the

363
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:45,519
plants into the trellis net which I

364
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:47,039
really enjoy doing the environment helps

365
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,159
a lot so it's really nice to be in there

366
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:51,039
something I'm going to add right now

367
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:53,439
glasses good grow room sunglasses they

368
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:54,879
make specific glasses to protect you

369
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,760
from the spectrum of light which you

370
00:12:54,879 --> 00:13:00,240
were using if you're using HPS LED

371
00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:02,039
ceramic metal hly they make a pair of

372
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,519
glasses to protect you from that

373
00:13:02,039 --> 00:13:06,519
Spectrum um our eyes are the most

374
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:08,679
sensitive organs on our body that are

375
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:11,399
exposed to the elements and also one of

376
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:13,638
the most critical uh senses we've got

377
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:15,839
for survival so protect your eyes invest

378
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:17,759
in your eyes get some good glasses to

379
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:19,600
cover your eyes but another thing I

380
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:21,639
wanted to say uh if we're going to be in

381
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,720
there a lot make it comfortable Jam some

382
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:26,000
good music get a good Bluetooth speaker

383
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:28,120
for the grow space that's not unheard of

384
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,720
at this time those Bluetooth speakers

385
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,639
are so affordable you can get a good

386
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:33,920
cheap speaker for like 20 bucks at the

387
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:35,360
gas station and it's going to bump you

388
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:38,879
could get something really nice at

389
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:40,480
Target or at Home Depot but those $20

390
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:41,720
little pieces of [ __ ] at the gas station

391
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,440
are going to bump and give you some

392
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,839
music especially if you're just

393
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,959
listening to the grow from your heart

394
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:48,279
podcast there's no super sound quality

395
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:50,198
to try to put out here other than my

396
00:13:48,278 --> 00:13:51,799
voice you don't need like cool bass

397
00:13:50,198 --> 00:13:54,240
riffs or there's no guitar chucking

398
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:56,359
through so just a decent speaker will

399
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,120
make it go a long way some gentle

400
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:00,560
entertainment in the grow space or some

401
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:02,399
airpods one of the to uh little little

402
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:04,599
Bluetooth speaker or some airpods so you

403
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,360
can get some music or a podcast going

404
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,480
that'll encourage you to go in there

405
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,720
sometimes I'm like I just want to listen

406
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,560
to this podcast I'm going to go

407
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,920
defoliate just so I have something to do

408
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:14,239
while I listen so get some music going

409
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:16,399
in there I don't care if it's Bluetooth

410
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,839
speakers or airpods get some sound

411
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,399
happening it's good for you it'll make

412
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:21,360
you feel better and you'll enjoy your

413
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:24,039
time in there then other things we're

414
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,919
going to talk about um Uline is your

415
00:14:24,039 --> 00:14:27,879
hero if you're a weed grower you

416
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:29,439
probably get a catalog from Uline in the

417
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:31,480
mail about once a month with all their

418
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,639
cool [ __ ] that they offer you they offer

419
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:35,199
some cool things they offer a push cart

420
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:37,079
that I really like you can load up all

421
00:14:35,198 --> 00:14:38,359
your nutrients on the bottom of that you

422
00:14:37,078 --> 00:14:40,159
could put a bunch of stuff on the bottom

423
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:42,120
of the cart all the heavy stuff and then

424
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:44,278
up top put like your scissors a box of

425
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:46,120
gloves your drink can go up there your

446
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:27,359
I just push it around from room to room

447
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:29,360
from grow to grow space to space um I

448
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,360
mix in another area so I can roll it

449
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,800
over the mix area and then bring it it

450
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,360
provides a lot of purpose I can set a

451
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:35,919
five gallon bucket on it I can carry

452
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:37,759
like eight five gallon buckets on there

453
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:40,439

00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:43,000
from Uline or a little basket of some

455

sort just to carry your [ __ ] around you

456
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,600
save a lot of time not going to get

457
00:15:45,198 --> 00:15:50,078
individual items all all the time like

458
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,959
in my clone area my cloning happens

459
00:15:50,078 --> 00:15:54,719
right here most of my nutrients are in

460
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:56,599
one area my mix area my cloning stuff

461
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:59,720
the uh the purple gel the Clone X and

462
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:01,519
the PH down and the pH pen are

463
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:03,319
um it's a thing I got it's came from

464
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,000
Target I'm pretty sure it's designed to

465
00:16:03,318 --> 00:16:06,278
go in the shower it looks like it could

466
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,360
hang right on the shower head and hold

467
00:16:06,278 --> 00:16:10,399
your shampoos and your loofah and

468
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:13,680
whatever but it's perfectly big enough

469
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:16,519
to hold the PH down the clonex gel the

470
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:18,519
clonex juice a Paras scissors a pH pen

471
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:20,198
and a box of gloves all fit perfectly in

472
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:22,360
this like little shower rack thing and

473
00:16:20,198 --> 00:16:24,519
that just hangs on the wall by my cloner

474
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:25,839
um it was designed to be for the shower

475
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:27,360
you know you put your shampoos and all

476
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:29,440

477
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,519
a plant in there uh I've got all my

478
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,160
cloning stuff right there so that if I

479
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:34,679
do decide to move the cloner to another

480
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:36,639
area just grab that all my cloning

481
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:39,120

00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:46,480
shower organizer is [ __ ] awesome

486
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:48,480
that's one of my favorites um where else

487
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,440
where else do we go from here oh um

488
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,000
something that I buy quite often that is

489
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:54,240
not definitely not meant to be for

490
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,000
growing and you'll see this uh in so

491
00:16:54,240 --> 00:17:00,360
many grows uh is beer cups I buy a lot

492
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,958
of beer cups the red solo party cups or

493
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:03,919
even the rainbow pack will work I don't

494
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:05,798
care what color they are but I like to

495
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:08,199
use those cups to put my little baby

496
00:17:05,798 --> 00:17:10,078
clones in uh if I cut clones right when

497
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:12,400
I put them into their first pot they go

498
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:14,000
into a beer cup a lot of the time uh one

499
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,000
thing I should stress is poke holes in

500
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,558
the bottoms of those beer cups um I

501
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,919
usually take a drill and I can stack up

502
00:17:17,558 --> 00:17:20,558
a bunch and just put one big hole

503
00:17:18,919 --> 00:17:21,880
through the bottom and then do a couple

504
00:17:20,558 --> 00:17:23,639
more just R right in the middle and then

505
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:26,000
a couple randomly through there you want

506
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:27,600
drainage I've also seen guys heat up a

507
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,519
hot poker and just push a poker through

508
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:30,839
a big stack of cups however that's going

509
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:32,960
to stink it's going to make smoke be

510
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:34,839
forewarned but put holes in those beer

511
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,120
cups and they work perfectly for little

512
00:17:34,839 --> 00:17:39,759
containers for small plants I've done

513
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:41,279
full breeding projects in beer cups so

514
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:42,798
uh that's something to think about not

515
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:45,079
going to tell you too much about that

516
00:17:42,798 --> 00:17:46,519
now but beer cups and a drill just get

517
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:48,879
some beer cups in a drill and you can

518
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:50,279
make uh like 52 pots for like eight

519
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,320
bucks you know it's not that expensive I

520
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:53,918
got a bad itch on my a ankle here I hope

521
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:55,279
this doesn't disrupt the show that

522
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:58,200
probably looked weird but it feels

523
00:17:55,279 --> 00:18:00,918
better all right where are we um duct

524
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:03,000
tape you you guys duct tape and zip ties

525
00:18:00,919 --> 00:18:05,000
are your hero um I don't know who said

526
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,640
it but someone one wise man it might

527
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,119
have been confucious confucious once

528
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,720
said if you can't duck it [ __ ] it so get

529
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:12,719
some duct tape you can fix almost

530
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,240
everything in the grow space uh get some

531
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,720
of that aluminum like the foil tape uh

532
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,480
you can cut your fingers on it real good

533
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,038
get some of that tape uh that stuff

534
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,038
sticks to everything you can fix a lot

535
00:18:20,038 --> 00:18:24,240
of [ __ ] with that that and duct tape and

536
00:18:22,038 --> 00:18:26,279
zip ties bro you cannot go wrong

537
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,599
everything is fixable with duct tape and

538
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:30,599
zip ties also something I use you're

539
00:18:28,599 --> 00:18:32,399
going to say bro you're 6'5 why do you

540
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:34,158
have one of these cuz sometimes there

541
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,840
[ __ ] I need to get to I have a step

542
00:18:34,159 --> 00:18:39,159
stool just a little it's a shitty step

543
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:41,639
stool from Home Depot and I use it way

544
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:43,200
more than you might imagine yeah I'm 65

545
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:45,038
but sometimes just getting up above the

546
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,240
light and be able being able to work on

547
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:48,119
top of the light without being on my

548
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,200
tippy toes makes it a lot freaking

549
00:18:48,119 --> 00:18:52,558
easier so maybe a little step stool uh

550
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,759
one of those folding um get the size you

551
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:55,000
need you know what I'm talking about but

552
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:58,000
if you need to get up top and get some

553
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,720
[ __ ] go get a step stool don't be shy a

554
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,919
little trash can for the grow is always

555
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:05,038
nice too I put a trash can with the

556
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:06,400
trash bag in it anytime I defoliate or

557
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:08,279
whatever if you use some of that silver

558
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,640
tape it's got a backing you need a trash

559
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:12,879
can I recommend a trash can with the lid

560
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,440
and a bag and get rid of that trash

561
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,520
every day take that trash out of your

562
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,919
grow room not just out of the grow but

563
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:21,038
if you can get it out of the house the

564
00:19:18,919 --> 00:19:23,000
facility whatever get rid of it as far

565
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:25,000
as you can from your grow uh let the

566
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,640
bugs go to those Dead Leaves outside

567
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,119
instead of in your environment you're

568
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,759
just asking for problems with Dead

569
00:19:28,119 --> 00:19:31,319
Leaves and full foliage around it's a

570
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:32,879
little trash can and some trash bags and

571
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:36,439
a duct tape or and some duct tape are

572
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:38,840
always your friend um I did not write

573
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:40,640
this on here but I just thought of this

574
00:19:38,839 --> 00:19:43,199
all of us Growers get [ __ ] sticky

575
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,759
trim time is sticky working is sticky we

576
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,600
need something to clean all that

577
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:48,640
stickiness off I like a bottle of

578
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:51,000
coconut oil uh go to your local health

579
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,880
food store or the Whole Foods or Sprouts

580
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,599
or uh natural groceries whatever you got

581
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,600
in your neighborhood go get a jar of

582
00:19:54,599 --> 00:19:58,759
coconut oil when your fingers are super

583
00:19:56,599 --> 00:20:00,279
sticky when my arm hair is sticky I'll

584
00:19:58,759 --> 00:20:01,720
just take coconut oil and just give

585
00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:03,720
myself one of these and just give it a

586
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:05,079
good rub and all that stickiness will

587
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:07,240
come right off then you got to wash with

588
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:09,918
soap and water after that but coconut

589
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:11,679
oil will get rid of all that stickiness

590
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:13,080
it helps a lot it will also help to

591
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:15,200
clean your scissors and all of your

592
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:17,319
other gear uh so if you got some sticky

593
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:20,840
[ __ ] coconut oil if you want to clean

594
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:23,200
surfaces that's when I recommend 91% ISO

595
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:24,599
uh try not to put the ISO on your skin

596
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,120
although it wouldn't be a surprise to

597
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:27,918
walk into the room and catch me washing

598
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:29,879
my hands with straight ISO cuz I'm

599
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:31,400
[ __ ] sticky don't do that you're

600
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:34,159
better than that your skin means more to

601
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:35,640
you than that do as I say not as I do

602
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:39,400
some [ __ ] like that I learned it from

603
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:41,120
you Dad um where are we a pH pen um I

604
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:44,038
recommend just getting a new pH and an

605
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:46,918
EC pin um I recently bought one that is

606
00:20:44,038 --> 00:20:48,519
a combo it is EC pH and temperature all

607
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:49,880
at the same time I drop one thing in

608
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:52,400
there and it tells me everything I need

609
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:54,559
to know that one tool makes me save a

610
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,120
couple of minutes every day which is

611
00:20:54,558 --> 00:20:57,918
encouraging it makes me want to play

612
00:20:56,119 --> 00:20:59,199
with it like I have a new toy that works

613
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:01,240
real well it stick stick it in the water

614
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,720
see what the EC pH and temperature are

615
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:05,240
all in one move instead of having to

616
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:07,759
dump multiple devices in here um get

617
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:09,798
yourself a good reliable EC and pH meter

618
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:11,400
it will make your life much better and

619
00:21:09,798 --> 00:21:13,000
it'll make the plants happier we're

620
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:17,278
banging off [ __ ] on this list here we're

621
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:19,278
going pretty quickly um dude something

622
00:21:17,278 --> 00:21:21,200
uh something I use a lot in a commercial

623
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:23,558
or in a regular uh commercial or homeg

624
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,278
grow environment is coat hangers when I

625
00:21:23,558 --> 00:21:26,678
harvest my plants I put them on coat

626
00:21:25,278 --> 00:21:28,839
hangers I just chop them and hang them

627
00:21:26,679 --> 00:21:31,720
up on coat hangers I buy a lot of coat

628
00:21:28,839 --> 00:21:33,558
hangers for grov also here's a dad hack

629
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:35,440
take a coat hanger right get the plastic

630
00:21:33,558 --> 00:21:37,119
kind uh or even the old metal ones will

631
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,320
work for this matter get the plastic

632
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:39,719
coat hanger it's got the piece that

633
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:42,000
comes down it's got the part where your

634
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:43,640
clothing would hang cut that part out

635
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,679
just get I use the Snips that I cut the

636
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:47,480
[ __ ] plants down with clip that [ __ ]

637
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,679
off there clip it off there now you got

638
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:50,558
your coat hanger that goes like this

639
00:21:48,679 --> 00:21:52,360
with a big gap put a roll of paper

640
00:21:50,558 --> 00:21:55,480
towels in that Gap and hang that [ __ ]

641
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:56,839
up what free idea there for you that's

642
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:59,120
probably the best advice I gave you in

643
00:21:56,839 --> 00:22:01,038
this whole episode take a coat hanger

644
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:02,519
cut out the middle part slap on a

645
00:22:01,038 --> 00:22:04,640
[ __ ] roll of paper towels you've got

646
00:22:02,519 --> 00:22:07,079
an awesome paper towel hanger for the

647
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:09,080
grow space right there [ __ ] genius

648
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:10,599
dude also something else I use a lot

649
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:11,879
that you can get at Walmart Target

650
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:14,240
anywhere that sells [ __ ] cheap

651
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:16,000
plastic items uh Amazon is good for this

652
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,960
the container stor has got them they are

653
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,759
under the bed bins designed to put your

654
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:21,679
clothing or whatever you want to store

655
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:23,038
under the bed but they're real shallow

656
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:25,480
they're like I don't know I want to say

657
00:22:23,038 --> 00:22:28,319
68 maybe 9 in deep I don't know about

658
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:30,360
that far um 6 or eight 9 in deep and

659
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:33,319
they're like 2 feet long and a foot wide

660
00:22:30,359 --> 00:22:35,079
maybe 18 in wide but I like those for

661
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:38,278
putting all kinds of [ __ ] in there I can

662
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:40,918
fit I think you can fit 48 uh maybe 24

663
00:22:38,278 --> 00:22:42,519
48 beer cups perfectly in the tray that

664
00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:44,120
I'm talking about so if you just want to

665
00:22:42,519 --> 00:22:45,839
fill one of those up do a little feno

666
00:22:44,119 --> 00:22:47,918
hunt maybe a quick breeding run in beer

667
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:50,240
cups that sterlite tray will hold a

668
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:52,320
bunch of Cups perfectly also when I'm

669
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,880
harvesting I'll chop down plants and put

670
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:55,839
it right into that bin and let it sit

671
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:58,159
there till it dries sometimes it will

672
00:22:55,839 --> 00:23:00,000
work in a pinch also when I'm harvesting

673
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:01,960
for seeds I hang the plant up till it's

674
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,839
dry once it's dry enough I put it in

675
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:05,200
that bin so that I do not lose my seeds

676
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:07,639
they don't fall out of anywhere except

677
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,519
into that bin then I'll take gloves and

678
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:11,799
bust all the buds off the sticks into

679
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:13,440
that bin then grind it all up real fine

680
00:23:11,798 --> 00:23:15,119
into that bin now I've got all my

681
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,200
material and my seeds in that bin that's

682
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:20,000
how I keep that bin of seeds kind of

683
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,480
isolated so I use a lot of stirl trays

684
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,960
uh they sell a bunch of different sizes

685
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:26,240
they will make your trim life and your

686
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:27,759
storage life much easier also I use a

687
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,400
lot of ball jars I thought of that cuz I

688
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:31,319
could see ball jars there's a box of

689
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:33,640
ball jars sitting over there uh my

690
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:36,399
long-term storage goes in ball jars or

691
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:37,679
turkey bags uh get you some turkey bags

692
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,400
it's going to be hard right now at this

693
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:41,159
time of year but or maybe it's easier I

694
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:44,320
don't know maybe they're available

695
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:45,960
turkey bags are great for storage um I'd

696
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:47,000
give you the paper towel hanger idea

697
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:49,079
that's probably the best one you're

698
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,720
going to get all day I told you about

699
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:53,359
sterlite bins I told you about the

700
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:56,880
hangers you guys I think we have covered

701
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:59,079
most of my ideas that I've got for items

702
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:01,000
we can use uh that are not not meant for

703
00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:03,720

704
