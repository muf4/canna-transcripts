65
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:26,159
letting you know what I'm smoking on

66
00:02:23,939 --> 00:02:28,769
today I'm taking dabs of this New York

67
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:31,379
City diesel and Broza batter from

68
00:02:28,769 --> 00:02:32,849
apothecary farms I'm giving it a nice

69
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:35,250
smell right now this stuff smells like

70
00:02:32,848 --> 00:02:37,589
like diesel fuel with a little bit of

71
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:39,000
lemons make a hit of oranges and then

72
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:40,950
there's kind of a sweet tart sort of

73
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,110
smell on top of it that I really enjoy a

74
00:02:40,949 --> 00:02:44,879
one thing about the New York City diesel

75
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:47,400
and Broza batter here that I'm smoking

76
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:49,318
on my eyes really don't get red when I

77
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,239
smoke I can smoke and I don't get red

78
00:02:49,318 --> 00:02:53,458
eyed but when I take one dab of this New

79
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:55,200
York City diesel my eyes go fully

80
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:57,479
bloodshot red I'm not sure what does it

81
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:59,280
but I get super red I get super head

82
00:02:57,479 --> 00:03:01,229
hide from it and I really enjoy it and

83
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,019
if that weren't enough I've been adding

84
00:03:01,229 --> 00:03:06,119
this sour amnesia high cannabinoid

85
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:08,189
full-spectrum extract into the mix and

86
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,200
it just adds a really a nice it's like

87
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:11,969
turbo charging my dad it is really nice

88
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:14,068
I like the lung expansion and the flavor

89
00:03:11,969 --> 00:03:16,049
from the New York City diesel then you

90
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:17,909
put the high cannabinoid full-spectrum

91
00:03:16,049 --> 00:03:20,519
extract on top and it really makes it

92
00:03:17,909 --> 00:03:22,139
like a turbocharged dad so I'm in the

93
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:23,280
mood for a podcast you guys I feel super

94
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:26,100
rambley I feel like I got a lot of

95
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,870
energy let's get into a podcast this

96
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:30,150
episode is going to be all about

97
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:31,259
trimming your cannabis plants that's

98
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,670
right we've learned how to tell when the

99
00:03:31,259 --> 00:03:34,439
plants are ripe we've learned how to cut

100
00:03:32,669 --> 00:03:35,669
them down we've learned how to harvest

101
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:37,229
them we learned how to hang them until

102
00:03:35,669 --> 00:03:39,388
they're ready to snap we know pretty

103
00:03:37,229 --> 00:03:42,539
well how to dry and cure now let's talk

104
00:03:39,389 --> 00:03:43,799
about trimming our plants now there are

105
00:03:42,539 --> 00:03:45,750
two different ways you can trim there's

106
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:48,959
wet trim and there is dry trim I

107
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:50,430
definitely prefer dry trim they're gonna

108
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,219
say why is dry trim better

109
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:55,709
I think dry trim is better because it's

110
00:03:53,219 --> 00:03:59,219
less sticky and it's much easier to work

111
00:03:55,709 --> 00:04:01,319
with it's also less work the leaves are

112
00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:02,400
dry those leaves are gonna fall off all

113
00:04:01,318 --> 00:04:03,899
you have to do is just brush them with

114
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,370
your thumb maybe touch them with the

115
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,500
scissors and those brittle leaves will

116
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:08,909
come right off of there the buds have

117
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,379
dried and tightened up and then it's a

118
00:04:08,909 --> 00:04:11,969
little more obvious for a new trimmer

119
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:14,729
what to take off you just want to take

120
00:04:11,969 --> 00:04:16,439
off that fluffy outside [ __ ] so it's a

121
00:04:14,729 --> 00:04:18,870
little less work it's less sticky and

122
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:19,790
there's also less chance to ruin your

123
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:21,620
buds

124
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:23,420
improperly storing them a lot of people

125
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:24,769
once the buds are trimmed if they wet

126
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:26,629
trim they like to just shove them into a

127
00:04:24,769 --> 00:04:28,609
container or a package and then those

128
00:04:26,629 --> 00:04:30,589
wet buds go into a container and that's

129
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:32,000
when they get ruined so we're not even

130
00:04:30,589 --> 00:04:33,949
gonna let that happen we're gonna let

131
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,019
the buds dry then we're gonna trim them

132
00:04:33,949 --> 00:04:37,579
then we'll put them in a container now a

133
00:04:36,019 --> 00:04:39,379
lot of people have listened to the dry

134
00:04:37,579 --> 00:04:41,719
and curing episode you may be trimming

135
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:43,519
these buds before they go into the jar

136
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,960
for cure you may be trimming these buds

137
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:46,459
after they've been in the cure jar for a

138
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:48,620
little while it's all the same process

139
00:04:46,459 --> 00:04:50,029
the leaves should be similar in dryness

140
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:51,590
they should just be popping right off of

141
00:04:50,029 --> 00:04:54,229
there you might not even need scissors

142
00:04:51,589 --> 00:04:56,089
for this sometimes when I'm dry trimming

143
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:57,319
the only thing I use my scissors for is

144
00:04:56,089 --> 00:04:59,119
for cutting the plant into smaller

145
00:04:57,319 --> 00:05:00,920
pieces and cutting the sticks out and

146
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,199
cutting the bigger buds down to smaller

147
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:04,910
buds now let's talk about a few

148
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,459
preparations we can make in a few items

149
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:09,080
we can have to create a comfortable and

150
00:05:07,459 --> 00:05:09,649
successful trim environment for

151
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:11,629
ourselves

152
00:05:09,649 --> 00:05:13,969
trimming sucks it's going to take a long

153
00:05:11,629 --> 00:05:16,430
time you're sitting in a chair with your

154
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:18,080
elbows up high staring straight into

155
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:20,569
something for a long time your neck your

156
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:23,389
elbows your eyes your back that stuff

157
00:05:20,569 --> 00:05:25,040
all gets sore and tired so let's try to

158
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:27,259
make it as comfortable as possible

159
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:28,640
I like to have a nice clean space I've

160
00:05:27,259 --> 00:05:30,439
got this table where I like to do my

161
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,269
work I clean the whole table off there's

162
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:34,310
nothing on the table except my dr.

163
00:05:32,269 --> 00:05:36,139
pepper and some trim supplies maybe my

164
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:37,459
phone for some entertainment but it's

165
00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:38,990
just there for music I'm not gonna be

166
00:05:37,459 --> 00:05:40,310
touching it don't have your phone out if

167
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:41,449
you're trimming you guys it's so [ __ ]

168
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:43,069
distracting and it'll slow you down

169
00:05:41,449 --> 00:05:45,170
it'll take twice as long put on a

170
00:05:43,069 --> 00:05:47,000
podcast hit play start [ __ ] trim it

171
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:48,740
anyway I like to have the table nice and

172
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,540
clean I don't need [ __ ] in my way I need

173
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:52,189
maybe my scissors for cutting my buds

174
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:53,720
into smaller pieces and then just a few

175
00:05:52,189 --> 00:05:56,269
basic essentials and we'll talk about

176
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:58,160
those a nice clean space I also like a

177
00:05:56,269 --> 00:06:00,019
nice comfortable chair you're gonna be

178
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,450
sitting there for a while get a cozy

179
00:06:00,019 --> 00:06:04,370
chair so a nice clean workspace in a

180
00:06:02,449 --> 00:06:06,199
cozy chair are super important for me

181
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:07,819
for trimming but then you need some sort

182
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,870
of entertainment hopefully you got

183
00:06:07,819 --> 00:06:10,610
somebody there to talk to

184
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:12,590
usually I got Mike or somebody around to

185
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:15,050
[ __ ] with some sort of conversation

186
00:06:12,589 --> 00:06:16,969
makes trimming go much more smoothly but

187
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:18,439
if you don't have that option put on a

188
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:20,120
podcast you guys I like to put on a

189
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:21,319
podcast of course I recommend old

190
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,899
episodes of the girl from your heart

191
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:25,159
podcast put on some Joe Rogan something

192
00:06:23,899 --> 00:06:27,049
like that maybe a YouTube video

193
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:29,480
something to entertain yourself to

194
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:30,949
listen to but nothing to look at back in

195
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,750
the day we used to trim all around the

196
00:06:30,949 --> 00:06:33,289
TV and we would watch youtube videos and

197
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,029
trim

198
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:37,370
I found that that is super distracting

199
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:38,539
don't watch videos people will put their

200
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:39,980
[ __ ] scissors down and you'll catch

201
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:41,870
them just watching TV if you're paying

202
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:44,230
people to trim don't have a TV in the

203
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:46,280
room podcasts maybe some stand-up comedy

204
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:47,660
it's hard to get everybody on the same

205
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:49,729
page when it comes to music but maybe

206
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:51,170
play some good music just some sort of

207
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:52,819
stuff to make it comfortable and help

208
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:54,710
the time pass without your brain going

209
00:06:52,819 --> 00:06:56,029
crazy is what I'm getting at you guys so

210
00:06:54,709 --> 00:06:57,620
you got a clean space you got a chair to

211
00:06:56,029 --> 00:06:59,539
sit in you got a good YouTube video on

212
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:01,220
you got a podcast going so now your cozy

213
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:03,410
your mind is entertained now you need

214
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:05,060
some gloves put some rubber gloves on

215
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:06,590
you want to wear gloves and you're

216
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:08,839
trimming you're going to get extremely

217
00:07:06,589 --> 00:07:10,489
sticky you don't want to have to itch

218
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:12,409
your face and have to go wash your hands

219
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:13,939
just to scratch your face you're gonna

220
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:16,370
be your hands are gonna be covered in

221
00:07:13,939 --> 00:07:18,680
trichomes and resin you guys wear gloves

222
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:20,360
also you need some good scissors I like

223
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:22,699
the little tiny Fiskars diamond tip

224
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,960
scissors that you get you can they're

225
00:07:22,699 --> 00:07:25,610
expensive at the gross store they're

226
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:27,169
cheaper at Hobby Lobby they saw them in

227
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:28,550
the craft section right the craft

228
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:30,080
section of Hobby Lobby that's all of

229
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:32,300
Hobby Lobby there's some in the fabric

230
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:34,009
section over there by the fabric there

231
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:36,470
are Fiskars diamond tip titanium

232
00:07:34,009 --> 00:07:37,879
scissors I really like those they work

233
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:39,290
really well for trimming they're super

234
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:40,879
light get something with the spring in

235
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:41,960
it that opens on its own because you

236
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:43,610
don't want to have to be opening and

237
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:44,839
closing scissors you don't want the kind

238
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:45,770
of scissors that have loops that go

239
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:47,329
around your fingers because you're gonna

240
00:07:45,769 --> 00:07:48,620
be cutting for so long those little

241
00:07:47,329 --> 00:07:51,349
loops around your fingers are gonna dig

242
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:53,509
into you you just want lightweight super

243
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:55,370
fast trimming shears they're easy to

244
00:07:53,509 --> 00:07:57,349
find and they're affordable maybe get

245
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:58,910
yourselves two pair so that you can set

246
00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:00,950
one in the rubbing alcohol to clean off

247
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:02,180
you can dirty up another pair swap them

248
00:08:00,949 --> 00:08:04,099
out real quick not have to spend a lot

249
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:05,689
of time cleaning your scissors so you

250
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:08,390
need some good gloves some good scissors

251
00:08:05,689 --> 00:08:10,850
then you need some containers you need a

252
00:08:08,389 --> 00:08:12,469
container for untrimmed buds I recommend

253
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:14,270
a five gallon bucket for the untrimmed

254
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:16,460
buds maybe you don't have that much herb

255
00:08:14,269 --> 00:08:18,169
maybe something smaller will work then

256
00:08:16,459 --> 00:08:20,930
you need another container for trimmed

257
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:22,970
buds then you need another container for

258
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:25,280
savable trim and then we need another

259
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:27,920
container for waste so you need trimmed

260
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:30,229
buds untrimmed buds usable trim and

261
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:31,370
waste a couple other things I'm gonna

262
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:32,810
recommend and you're gonna say why the

263
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:34,879
hell would he recommend this for a grow

264
00:08:32,809 --> 00:08:36,829
I would recommend either some coconut

265
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:38,629
oil or some baby oil for your trim

266
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:41,270
session you're gonna say why do we need

267
00:08:38,629 --> 00:08:43,580
that here is why when your fingers and

268
00:08:41,269 --> 00:08:45,529
hands and arms get all sticky you can

269
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:46,360
use the coconut oil or the baby oil to

270
00:08:45,529 --> 00:08:47,620
remove the trike

271
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,450
that's right if your hands are all

272
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:50,950
covered in resin my thing is that my

273
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:52,269
arms get covered in Resident cuz I'm the

274
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:53,140
one cutting down the plants I'm reaching

275
00:08:52,269 --> 00:08:54,940
in there and playing with them and

276
00:08:53,139 --> 00:08:56,588
carrying them around my arm hair and

277
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:59,050
[ __ ] gets all coated in trichomes and

278
00:08:56,589 --> 00:09:00,760
and plant resin so I use a coconut oil

279
00:08:59,049 --> 00:09:02,769
or baby oil to just rub up on my arms

280
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:04,028
and rub that [ __ ] right off and all the

281
00:09:02,769 --> 00:09:06,310
resin comes right off and then you're

282
00:09:04,028 --> 00:09:07,659
not all sticky all right so that's the

283
00:09:06,309 --> 00:09:10,059
basic breakdown of things that you're

284
00:09:07,659 --> 00:09:11,679
going to need for your trim session you

285
00:09:10,059 --> 00:09:13,299
need a nice clean space in which to work

286
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:15,729
you need a nice cozy chair in which to

287
00:09:13,299 --> 00:09:17,319
sit you need a good podcast to listen to

288
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:18,459
probably the girl from your our podcast

289
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,320
then you need some gloves you need

290
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:21,819
scissors then you need your containers

291
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,589
then you've got your cleanup supplies

292
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:26,140
now let's talk about doing the manual

293
00:09:23,589 --> 00:09:28,000
work hopefully a few days before harvest

294
00:09:26,139 --> 00:09:30,039
you went in and did a pre harvest

295
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,049
defoliation now what I mean by that is

296
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:34,449
while the plants are still alive while

297
00:09:32,049 --> 00:09:36,189
you're flushing anywhere between I don't

298
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:37,778
know seven days before harvest up to the

299
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:39,310
day of harvest you can go in there and

300
00:09:37,778 --> 00:09:41,470
just start pulling off all of the big

301
00:09:39,309 --> 00:09:42,699
leaves the plants are done growing

302
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:44,290
they're just flushing out they're just

303
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,850
finishing up the trichomes are ripening

304
00:09:44,289 --> 00:09:47,439
up you don't need all that excess leaf

305
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:50,409
in there so just go ahead and tear all

306
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:52,300
that leaf out of the room having a pre

307
00:09:50,409 --> 00:09:53,769
harvest defoliation session will save

308
00:09:52,299 --> 00:09:56,979
you a lot of time when it comes time to

309
00:09:53,769 --> 00:09:58,899
trim because all of that long straggly

310
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:00,370
leaf is already gone it's not even there

311
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:02,379
to deal with it's already been removed

312
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:04,659
and it will also help your drying and

313
00:10:02,379 --> 00:10:06,759
curing time so go in and pull off all

314
00:10:04,659 --> 00:10:08,439
the big leaves before you harvest then

315
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:10,208
it's harvest time I've done a highly

316
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:12,220
detailed harvest episode if you haven't

317
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:14,769
listened to that go listen to that then

318
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:16,360
come catch up at the end of the harvest

319
00:10:14,769 --> 00:10:18,100
episode we're left with our plants

320
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:20,079
hanging upside down in a controlled

321
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:22,149
environment now we want those plants to

322
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:24,399
get to where the sticks snap once the

323
00:10:22,149 --> 00:10:26,620
sticks get snappy you can start trimming

324
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,328
you can also start trimming them after

325
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:30,459
they've been in their cured containers

326
00:10:28,328 --> 00:10:32,259
for a little while I like dry trim I'm

327
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:33,639
just waiting for the buds to be dry

328
00:10:32,259 --> 00:10:35,350
enough toward the leaves kind of just

329
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:36,879
flake right off there's still gonna be

330
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:38,440
moisture inside those buds there's

331
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:39,669
moisture in the middle but the outside

332
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,470
is dry enough to where you can just kind

333
00:10:39,669 --> 00:10:43,389
of knock the the buds off the leaves off

334
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:44,860
the buds with your thumb I'm making a

335
00:10:43,389 --> 00:10:46,448
little motion with my hands that sort of

336
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:47,800
looks like I'm playing a video game like

337
00:10:46,448 --> 00:10:49,000
I've got a game controller in my hand

338
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:51,309
but my hands are really close together

339
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,470
in my mind I'm just holding that little

340
00:10:51,309 --> 00:10:56,078
bud with my four fingers or maybe with

341
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:57,940
my left hand and I'm just knocking the

342
00:10:56,078 --> 00:10:58,949
leaves off with my right hand

343
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:00,180
just like I'm

344
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:01,350
it looks like I'm playing a video game

345
00:11:00,179 --> 00:11:03,239
I'm just holding the bud and just

346
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:04,889
rubbing the leaves right off if you hold

347
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,419
it with the bud facing up if you rub

348
00:11:04,889 --> 00:11:07,919
down those leaves will just rub right

349
00:11:06,419 --> 00:11:09,269
off you'll see what I'm talking about

350
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:11,759
when you figure out the technique you go

351
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:13,649
man that is so easy so my point is that

352
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:14,759
I want it to where the buds are dry I

353
00:11:13,649 --> 00:11:16,289
want to be able to just knock those

354
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:19,259
leaves right off so here is how I

355
00:11:16,289 --> 00:11:20,549
actually do my trimming whenever I'm

356
00:11:19,259 --> 00:11:23,129
working with the plants I like to wear

357
00:11:20,549 --> 00:11:24,689
gloves so step one of trimming is put on

358
00:11:23,129 --> 00:11:26,399
some rubber gloves I like the six

359
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:27,570
millimeter nitrile gloves I don't care

360
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,730
if they're black I don't care if they're

361
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:31,709
blue I just care that they fit and that

362
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:33,300
they're comfortable so glove up I don't

363
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:35,849
want to get all sticky and also I don't

364
00:11:33,299 --> 00:11:37,859
want to get my skin all over the buds so

365
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:40,560
step one is glove up step two of

366
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:42,899
trimming is to knock all of the buds off

367
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:44,909
of the sticks into a five-gallon bucket

368
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:47,129
this makes it so much easier just go and

369
00:11:44,909 --> 00:11:49,139
get everybody off the sticks into a

370
00:11:47,129 --> 00:11:51,240
bucket and then discard all the sticks

371
00:11:49,139 --> 00:11:53,429
now you've compressed your work into a

372
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:55,259
much smaller space it looks way less

373
00:11:53,429 --> 00:11:56,849
overwhelming and you can see what you've

374
00:11:55,259 --> 00:11:58,559
got ahead of you you've got a five

375
00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:00,209
gallon bucket filled with buds that you

376
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:02,519
need to trim it doesn't look like this

377
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:04,500
big sprawl of branches and leaves and

378
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:05,939
[ __ ] everywhere just the bucket it's way

379
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,330
less intimidating and you can get

380
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:08,660
through it

381
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:11,009
so knock all the buds into a bucket

382
00:12:08,659 --> 00:12:12,569
maybe you can use just a small bowl

383
00:12:11,009 --> 00:12:14,159
maybe you can use something smaller I'm

384
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:16,050
not sure how much you grew maybe you

385
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:17,850
need five buckets I hope you need ten or

386
00:12:16,049 --> 00:12:19,169
twenty five gallon buckets but find the

387
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:21,450
container that's the right size for what

388
00:12:19,169 --> 00:12:23,370
you need a five gallon bucket from Home

389
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:25,709
Depot or Lowe's is really affordable and

390
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:28,049
they're disposable so I like to use the

391
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:30,629
buckets so I knock every bud into a

392
00:12:28,049 --> 00:12:32,759
bucket now I've got a five gallon bucket

393
00:12:30,629 --> 00:12:34,620
full of buds my next step is just to

394
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:37,259
reach in grab the bud off the top and

395
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:38,700
start trimming now I'll actually start

396
00:12:37,259 --> 00:12:40,860
talking about trimming a little bit and

397
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:43,950
the actual trimming of the bud process

398
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:45,990
the idea is to knock or cut off all of

399
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:49,560
the excessive leaves and stems and give

400
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:51,180
yourself a nice pretty presentable but

401
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:52,828
you guys know what a good trimmed bud

402
00:12:51,179 --> 00:12:55,169
looks like when they start off they're

403
00:12:52,828 --> 00:12:57,000
covered in leaves it's our job to knock

404
00:12:55,169 --> 00:12:59,278
those leaves off we don't want to smoke

405
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,208
leaves leaves contain chlorophyll leaves

406
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:02,338
don't taste good

407
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:06,629
leaves don't get you high what we want

408
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:07,890
is a nice frosty green nugget so once

409
00:13:06,629 --> 00:13:09,480
you guys get started trim and you'll see

410
00:13:07,889 --> 00:13:11,399
what's leaf material and what is a

411
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,180
usable but once you start digging in

412
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:13,289
there and just start not

413
00:13:12,179 --> 00:13:14,909
and off some of the leaf you'll find

414
00:13:13,289 --> 00:13:17,129
that but in the middle and it will start

415
00:13:14,909 --> 00:13:19,139
to become very obvious what you do and

416
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:21,419
do not trim if your buds are kind of

417
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:23,909
airy and fluffy don't trim too deeply

418
00:13:21,419 --> 00:13:25,709
just knock off the leaves I like to grab

419
00:13:23,909 --> 00:13:27,419
the bud by the base by that little stick

420
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:29,550
at the bottom of the bud and just use my

421
00:13:27,419 --> 00:13:31,740
thumb to push the leaves off I just kind

422
00:13:29,549 --> 00:13:33,359
of spin the bud in a circle with my left

423
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:35,070
hand I will turn it I'm looking that's

424
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,050
counterclockwise no that is clockwise

425
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:39,120
I'll turn the bud clockwise and as it

426
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:40,708
comes toward me I'll use my right thumb

427
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,480
I'm using my left hand to spin the bud

428
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:44,129
toward me and is that one side come

429
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,990
towards me comes toward me my thumb just

430
00:13:44,129 --> 00:13:47,850
knocks the leaves off right there I'm

431
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:49,620
just wiping them off like I'm just just

432
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:51,180
scraping the leaves off they're so dry

433
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,950
that they knock off on their own and

434
00:13:51,179 --> 00:13:54,479
don't press so hard that you're [ __ ]

435
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:56,250
up the shape of the bud and knocking off

436
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,170
trichomes you can do this really gently

437
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:59,909
you'll find the technique after you do

438
00:13:58,169 --> 00:14:01,289
it a few times it'll be really

439
00:13:59,909 --> 00:14:02,939
comfortable and you'll get really fast

440
00:14:01,289 --> 00:14:04,169
at it a lot of people like to do this

441
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:05,430
with scissors they'll hold it in the

442
00:14:04,169 --> 00:14:07,289
left hand and they'll take their

443
00:14:05,429 --> 00:14:09,000
scissors and just turn it and trim it

444
00:14:07,289 --> 00:14:11,159
the leaves are sticking off horizontally

445
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,899
just keep your scissors horizontal you

446
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:14,490
can get adjust your angle as you need

447
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:15,870
and just spin that bud and keep cutting

448
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:17,250
just like you're giving it a haircut you

449
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:19,259
just want to take off those leaves and

450
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:21,870
leave that bud there so just knock off

451
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:23,730
the leaves don't carve too deeply into

452
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:24,839
the buds and don't squish the buds while

453
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:26,490
you're trimming them don't squeeze them

454
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:28,890
super hard and try not to handle them

455
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:30,600
too much a little tiny bud doesn't need

456
00:14:28,889 --> 00:14:32,100
a lot of handling you don't want to get

457
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,470
all those trichomes on your gloves you

458
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:36,060
want to leave the trichomes on the bud

459
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:37,410
so you can use scissors if you want I

460
00:14:36,059 --> 00:14:39,299
like my thumbs for most trimming you

461
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:40,740
guys the little edge of my thumb and my

462
00:14:39,299 --> 00:14:42,599
thumbnail is a perfect little trimmer

463
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:44,850
for me I've mastered that technique I

464
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,709
knock off the little leaves and cut the

465
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:48,570
big buds into smaller sizes if you guys

466
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:49,979
can see a stick in there and it's like

467
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:51,900
one bud and then a little stick and

468
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:54,509
another bud take that [ __ ] out nobody

469
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:57,600
wants to buy a stick connoisseur quality

470
00:14:54,509 --> 00:14:59,250
bud is taken down to the small part if

471
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:02,009
you want to leave your buds in big buds

472
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:03,809
that's fine it's up to you I like them

473
00:15:02,009 --> 00:15:05,490
smaller a lot of people don't want to

474
00:15:03,809 --> 00:15:06,689
buy a big stick you'll see people I

475
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:08,159
don't know you'll have some customers

476
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:10,110
that want big buds I used to have people

477
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:11,278
that just wanted big buds and then some

478
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:13,350
people know better they're like man I

479
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:15,120
don't want to buy that quarter that one

480
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:16,589
one bud that weighs a quarter because I

481
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,940
know right up the middle of it as a gram

482
00:15:16,589 --> 00:15:19,500
of stick and I'm getting ripped off so

483
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:22,650
some people want it some people don't

484
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:24,149
that's up to you so once you've got it

485
00:15:22,649 --> 00:15:25,860
trimmed up to the size you want it and

486
00:15:24,149 --> 00:15:28,078
the

487
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:30,060
of trim you want I cut off all the

488
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:31,439
little leaves at the bottom also there's

489
00:15:30,059 --> 00:15:32,819
like a lot of people leave little

490
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,810
cabbagey looking leaves at the bottom I

491
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:35,730
cut that [ __ ] off

492
00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:37,799
I call it cabbage and I also take out

493
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:38,909
the handlebar sticks on the bottom

494
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:41,159
you're gonna have the branch that the

495
00:15:38,909 --> 00:15:42,509
bud was actually stuck to the branch to

496
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:43,769
and then there's two little sticks that

497
00:15:42,509 --> 00:15:44,909
come out that those first leaves were

498
00:15:43,769 --> 00:15:46,528
attached to and they're all dry and

499
00:15:44,909 --> 00:15:48,778
shitty look and cut those off of there

500
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:50,250
if you've got a pound of weed and you've

501
00:15:48,778 --> 00:15:52,320
got all those little tiny sticks in

502
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:53,700
there those little sticks make your

503
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,930
pound look like [ __ ] just take it out

504
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:56,070
and your pound is gonna look so much

505
00:15:54,929 --> 00:15:57,958
better it's gonna be so much more

506
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:59,820
desirable it's gonna get you more money

507
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:02,039
alright so that's the bottom line here

508
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:03,870
trim it and it's worth more money so

509
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:05,699
take off all the leaves take off that

510
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:07,110
little stick at the bottom knock off all

511
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:08,970
the crow's feet if you've got a little

512
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:10,709
tiny pointy leaf sticking out of

513
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:11,399
somewhere cut that out or knock it off

514
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:13,078
with your thumb

515
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:15,179
those little triangle leaves make you

516
00:16:13,078 --> 00:16:16,620
look lazy if you did a whole good job on

517
00:16:15,179 --> 00:16:18,509
most of the bud and you just left one or

518
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:21,240
two little triangles at the tip you look

519
00:16:18,509 --> 00:16:23,069
lazy take that stuff out of there so

520
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:25,169
while I'm doing this all the trimming

521
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:27,480
work I trim over a tray or a container

522
00:16:25,169 --> 00:16:29,519
to catch what I trim off all that little

523
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:31,620
stuff that gets clipped off is going to

524
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:33,990
be used to make concentrates or edibles

525
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:36,269
in the future so gather all that stuff

526
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:37,620
up take care of it don't just don't trim

527
00:16:36,269 --> 00:16:39,299
into the floor and then sweep it up

528
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:40,828
don't trim onto the table and then scoop

529
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:42,778
it up trim onto a tray trim into a

530
00:16:40,828 --> 00:16:44,309
container so that it is kept clean so

531
00:16:42,778 --> 00:16:46,198
it's treated with respect because it may

532
00:16:44,309 --> 00:16:48,000
go into edibles and things that you're

533
00:16:46,198 --> 00:16:50,009
gonna eat need to be treated with

534
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,600
respect things you're gonna smoke need

535
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:53,669
to be treated with respect this is our

536
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,889
medicine so gather this stuff up and

537
00:16:53,669 --> 00:16:58,319
vacuum seal it I like to keep the trim

538
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:59,970
in a vacuum sealed bag in the dark until

539
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,010
I'm able to use it get that to your

540
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:04,620
extractor as soon as you can

541
00:17:02,009 --> 00:17:06,509
now the sticks those are thrown away I

542
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:08,308
throw all the sticks away in a

543
00:17:06,509 --> 00:17:09,929
commercial grow they're thrown away in a

544
00:17:08,308 --> 00:17:11,308
home grow those should go to the compost

545
00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:14,040
pile or they could be burned or

546
00:17:11,308 --> 00:17:15,990
something but the sticks are trash don't

547
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:17,308
try to extract sticks you guys that's a

548
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:19,259
waste of time it's a waste of energy

549
00:17:17,308 --> 00:17:21,539
you're not gonna get anything out of it

550
00:17:19,259 --> 00:17:23,338
and also if you're adding the sticks to

551
00:17:21,539 --> 00:17:26,879
the trim you're just making the hash

552
00:17:23,338 --> 00:17:28,500
worse you're not making it better what

553
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,240
goes in comes out and if you just put

554
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:33,630
[ __ ] in to make more you're gonna get

555
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:36,450
more but it's gonna be [ __ ] so gather up

556
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:39,030
all your trim vacuum seal the trim keep

557
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:39,509
the trim in a dark place and get that to

558
00:17:39,029 --> 00:17:41,160
some

559
00:17:39,509 --> 00:17:44,009
they can turn that into concentrates for

560
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:46,650
you also if you've got like yellow or

561
00:17:44,009 --> 00:17:48,390
brown or funky leaves that are falling

562
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:50,370
off as you're trimming separate those

563
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:52,170
pull those out of the trim don't send

564
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:53,579
that to the extractor that's gonna make

565
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:55,140
your hash and dark that's gonna make

566
00:17:53,579 --> 00:17:56,909
your hash taste like [ __ ] it's gonna

567
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:58,920
make it less potent and it's gonna make

568
00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:00,840
it less desirable so do a little work

569
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:03,420
clean it up get it out of there and you

570
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:05,220
will have a better product so use your

571
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:06,779
thumbs or some scissors to gently remove

572
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:08,250
the excess leaves and the little stems

573
00:18:06,779 --> 00:18:09,480
from the buds get rid of the handlebars

574
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:11,250
get rid of the crow's feet

575
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:13,410
now once the buds are trimmed to your

576
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:15,809
satisfaction you can place them into a

577
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:18,029
container for finished products now when

578
00:18:15,809 --> 00:18:19,319
I say to your satisfaction how you want

579
00:18:18,029 --> 00:18:21,210
to trim your buds is up to you if you

580
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:22,470
want to leave it a little fluffy go for

581
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:25,980
it if you want to trim it nice and tight

582
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:27,870
go for it that is up to you if your

583
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:29,640
product is for you personally then you

584
00:18:27,869 --> 00:18:31,049
can leave it as leafy as you want you

585
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,490
can knock those leaves off right before

586
00:18:31,049 --> 00:18:34,259
you smoke it you can clean it up

587
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:36,120
yourself if you plan on getting top

588
00:18:34,259 --> 00:18:39,390
dollar for your product you'll need to

589
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:40,709
have a tight clean trim job one thing I

590
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:42,810
should mention that will help us speed

591
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:44,730
up the process of trimming is the rule

592
00:18:42,809 --> 00:18:46,169
of thumb if the bud you were trimming is

593
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:48,599
not bigger than the tip of your thumb

594
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:50,550
it's probably better to let that bud go

595
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:52,319
to your hash pile and trim something

596
00:18:50,549 --> 00:18:54,480
more substantial put those little

597
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:56,129
popcorn buds in the hash pile put it in

598
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,900
your trim pile and you can make better

599
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:59,670
hash that will improve the quality of

600
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:01,410
your concentrates so if it's a little

601
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:03,600
tiny bud don't waste time trimming it

602
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:04,950
just throw it in the hash pile and don't

603
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:06,509
waste your time trimming little tiny

604
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:09,420
buds if you feel like that little tiny

605
00:19:06,509 --> 00:19:11,309
bud is worth less money than the time it

606
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:13,110
is taking you to trim it set it aside

607
00:19:11,309 --> 00:19:15,899
and put it in the hash pile you don't

608
00:19:13,109 --> 00:19:19,139
have to trim that if herb costs ten

609
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:21,060
dollars a gram and it takes you like a

610
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:22,860
minute to trim that little nug it's not

611
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:24,659
cost-effective so toss that little nugge

612
00:19:22,859 --> 00:19:26,129
to the trim bin we'll add that to the

613
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:27,990
concentrates grab something that we can

614
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:31,410
trim and get on the shelf and make it

615
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:32,579
purchasable for the consumer so if it's

616
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:33,990
real tiny if it's ugly

617
00:19:32,579 --> 00:19:36,240
don't bother trimming it you can put

618
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:38,700
that in your hash pile you can add that

619
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,650
to the to be extracted pile and that

620
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:42,569
will just improve your concentrates it

621
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:45,509
will also speed you up of course if you

622
00:19:42,569 --> 00:19:47,039
need every little half gram every piece

623
00:19:45,509 --> 00:19:48,960
of gravel out of that crop to make your

624
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:50,579
goal to make your wait go ahead and trim

625
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,769
that up add that that'll be weight in

626
00:19:50,579 --> 00:19:54,689
the bottom of the bag but if

627
00:19:52,769 --> 00:19:56,190
not necessary if it's just for you put

628
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:58,890
that in the concentrate pile and speed

629
00:19:56,190 --> 00:20:01,470
yourself up in the commercial grow the

630
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:03,780
growers are expected to kick out a pound

631
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:06,000
minimum per person per shift some people

632
00:20:03,779 --> 00:20:07,500
turn in two pounds every day and if they

633
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,359
spend time trim in that little gravel

634
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:11,160
[ __ ] they would never get there we have

635
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:12,569
a way of separating all those little

636
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:14,279
tiny buds all that little stuff gets

637
00:20:12,569 --> 00:20:16,649
filtered out it gets pushed to the side

638
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:18,480
and then all of that those little buds

639
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:20,790
and the trim they're combined and it

640
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,289
gets turned in to concentrates so do a

641
00:20:20,789 --> 00:20:24,690
nice tight trim if you want to sell it

642
00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:26,519
but don't go overboard don't trim it too

643
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:27,930
tight and also don't try trimming all

644
00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:29,400
those little buds or you're gonna put

645
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:31,710
yourself in debt you've got to pay your

646
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:33,090
trimmers you're spending your time make

647
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:34,799
it cost-effective

648
00:20:33,089 --> 00:20:36,689
now something I want to mention trimming

649
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:40,559
will be very strain dependent some buds

650
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:42,269
are tight some buds are real fluffy some

651
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:43,710
buds are a little compacted little rocks

652
00:20:42,269 --> 00:20:45,809
you can just kind of rub your fingers

653
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:47,519
over those and those are gonna trim some

654
00:20:45,809 --> 00:20:49,559
buds our area and have a lot of texture

655
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:50,910
to them those are gonna be a little

656
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:52,589
harder to trim because you don't want to

657
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:54,960
knock off all those calyxes you're going

658
00:20:52,589 --> 00:20:56,819
to have to adjust also if you're working

659
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,529
for somebody else you're going to have

660
00:20:56,819 --> 00:21:00,359
to adjust to how they want it trimmed

661
00:20:58,529 --> 00:21:02,490
when you go to a grow and you're working

662
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:05,129
for someone else they get to dictate how

663
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:07,349
tight your trim is don't over trim don't

664
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:08,520
under trim you trim to their expectation

665
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:10,079
if you're not sure what they want

666
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:12,029
have them trim up a bud and show you

667
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:13,379
have them trim up two or three buds and

668
00:21:12,029 --> 00:21:15,000
set those at your workstation so you

669
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:16,860
have something to refer to as the day

670
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,420
goes on so that you don't forget and

671
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:19,799
also if they come by and say hey why you

672
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:21,150
doing it like that you got a couple

673
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:22,799
little buds to show them you could say

674
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:24,360
these are what you showed me this is

675
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:25,859
what I did show me the difference show

676
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:26,969
me where I'm going wrong then they can

677
00:21:25,859 --> 00:21:28,740
say [ __ ] you're doing it just like I

678
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:30,600
showed you I'm sorry so we got a nice

679
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:32,190
tight trim we're setting the trim in one

680
00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:33,929
pile we're setting our little tiny buds

681
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:35,400
in another pile we're mixing that up so

682
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:38,160
we can make good concentrates out of it

683
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:39,870
we're getting rid of all the sticks you

684
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:41,700
guys I think we have covered most of

685
00:21:39,869 --> 00:21:44,129
trimming one great thing about trimming

686
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:45,509
is scissor and glove hatch all that

687
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:47,760
sticky [ __ ] that builds up on your

688
00:21:45,509 --> 00:21:50,220
gloves and scissors is smokeable you can

689
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:52,500
smoke that right away Mike love scissor

690
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:53,850
hatch what I like to do if I've got if

691
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,710
I've been trimming so see even trim and

692
00:21:53,849 --> 00:21:58,139
you've got this weird layer of like

693
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:59,670
sticky gooey looking [ __ ] all over your

694
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:02,160
gloves that's resin that's trichomes

695
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:03,840
that is potency rub your hands together

696
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:05,100
and you'll start figuring out how to rub

697
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:06,109
your hands in a circle to make that

698
00:22:05,099 --> 00:22:07,789
stuff stick to

699
00:22:06,109 --> 00:22:09,589
a little bit of heat goes a long way so

700
00:22:07,789 --> 00:22:10,970
if your hands get warm it'll start

701
00:22:09,589 --> 00:22:12,799
taking that resin right off of your

702
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:15,440
hands I don't want to smoke it off your

703
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:17,899
skin back in the day we used to call it

704
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:20,059
finger hash but please wear gloves now

705
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:21,350
and we're gonna call it glove hatch you

706
00:22:20,059 --> 00:22:23,240
can scrape it off your scissors you can

707
00:22:21,349 --> 00:22:24,949
smoke it off your gloves then put it in

708
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:26,870
a bowl you can put it on top of some pot

709
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:28,880
or just put it in an empty bowl and just

710
00:22:26,869 --> 00:22:30,439
put a flame to it and melt it just

711
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,970
slowly melt that [ __ ] until it starts

712
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:34,130
smoking and you can smoke that sizzurp

713
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:36,680
hash that glove hash you can smoke it

714
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:39,020
right away but please don't pass that

715
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:40,610
[ __ ] to me if you did that off your skin

716
00:22:39,019 --> 00:22:43,639
and weren't wearing gloves I don't want

717
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:45,079
to smoke your skin so that's one good

718
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:47,600
thing about trimming is you get scissor

719
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:48,619
hash right away I think that anything

720
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:50,000
that sticks to your gloves

721
00:22:48,619 --> 00:22:51,829
that's yours you get to smoke that if

722
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,029
you come trim for me and that [ __ ] stick

723
00:22:51,829 --> 00:22:54,379
to your gloves I have no problem with

724
00:22:53,029 --> 00:22:55,910
you rolling that right off your glove

725
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:57,260
put that in a pipe and smoke it right in

726
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:58,460
front of me you earned that that is your

727
00:22:57,259 --> 00:23:00,859
scissor hash that means you're trimming

728
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:02,920
your ass off if it's on your scissors

729
00:23:00,859 --> 00:23:05,449
scrape your scissors off smoke that [ __ ]

730
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:06,529
what a lot of people will do all the

731
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:07,940
trimmers in the room will just gather

732
00:23:06,529 --> 00:23:09,379
all their scissor hash into one pile and

733
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:10,490
put it into a big ball and then at the

734
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:13,130
end of the day you guys all smoke that

735
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:15,230
together like a little celebration but

736
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:16,520
it's smokeable that's my point you can

737
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:18,829
make edibles out of it if you want to

738
00:23:16,519 --> 00:23:20,660
but I would recommend smoking it Mike

739
00:23:18,829 --> 00:23:21,919
loves smoking it's not my favorite to

740
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:23,779
smoke it's a little odd it's heavy on

741
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:26,150
the lungs and it tastes kind of wet but

742
00:23:23,779 --> 00:23:29,240
it is potent and it will give you a big

743
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:30,590
fat hit another great thing about dry

744
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:32,210
trimming that I didn't mention is that

745
00:23:30,589 --> 00:23:33,799
when you are done trimming you can now

746
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:35,210
weigh your product you've been cutting

747
00:23:33,799 --> 00:23:36,349
off the extra crap and throwing that in

748
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:38,360
one pile then you've been thrown those

749
00:23:36,349 --> 00:23:39,679
finished buds into one pile all you got

750
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:41,329
to do is set that container on the scale

751
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,980
and weigh it now one thing I would

752
00:23:41,329 --> 00:23:44,419
recommend it's a good idea whatever

753
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:45,980
container you're going to throw your

754
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:47,870
buds in to your finished buds if it's

755
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:50,180
gonna be a bucket if it's gonna be a

756
00:23:47,869 --> 00:23:52,339
Tupperware container wave that and write

757
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:54,170
the weight of that on your container so

758
00:23:52,339 --> 00:23:55,699
that when you're done trimming into that

759
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:57,590
container you know how much that weighs

760
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:59,029
so just subtract the weight of your

761
00:23:57,589 --> 00:24:00,799
container and now you know how much

762
00:23:59,029 --> 00:24:02,690
product is on the scale so it's always

763
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:04,220
rewarding knowing how much product

764
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:05,960
you've got right at the end of the trim

765
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:07,610
process when you wet trim you don't know

766
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:09,259
is you've gotta wait for it to dry still

767
00:24:07,609 --> 00:24:10,429
so when people say how much did you trim

768
00:24:09,259 --> 00:24:11,960
today and they said I trimmed a black

769
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:13,370
pound how do you know bro it was wet

770
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:15,590
it's got a dry we'll find out in a few

771
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:17,539
days so if you're paying people to trim

772
00:24:15,589 --> 00:24:19,538
by the pound dry trim is the way to go

773
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:21,220
because now you've got dry

774
00:24:19,538 --> 00:24:23,589
away you don't have a wet pound to guess

775
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:25,298
on the weight so here's one more thing I

776
00:24:23,589 --> 00:24:26,589
should definitely mention to all of my

777
00:24:25,298 --> 00:24:28,298
friends who have never trimmed before

778
00:24:26,589 --> 00:24:30,728
everybody who is new with cannabis

779
00:24:28,298 --> 00:24:33,308
here's something that I have to tell you

780
00:24:30,729 --> 00:24:35,710
when you were trimming or working with

781
00:24:33,308 --> 00:24:39,009
plants in general do not touch your eyes

782
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:41,319
with sticky trim fingers don't rub your

783
00:24:39,009 --> 00:24:43,149
eye with the back of your hand go wash

784
00:24:41,319 --> 00:24:45,729
your hands before you touch your eyes if

785
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:47,768
you rub your eyes with trichomes or

786
00:24:45,729 --> 00:24:50,229
plant resin on your finger it is going

787
00:24:47,769 --> 00:24:52,479
to burn for the next hour and it is

788
00:24:50,229 --> 00:24:53,830
sticky every time you blink most of the

789
00:24:52,479 --> 00:24:55,419
time you think you can blink and it will

790
00:24:53,829 --> 00:24:57,158
fix your sticky eye or whatever's in

791
00:24:55,419 --> 00:24:58,690
your eye not when you have resin in your

792
00:24:57,159 --> 00:25:00,249
hai every time you blink it gets [ __ ]

793
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:01,989
stickier and it feels like your eyelid

794
00:25:00,249 --> 00:25:05,108
is sticking to your eyeball and it just

795
00:25:01,989 --> 00:25:07,028
burns so wear gloves and if you need to

796
00:25:05,108 --> 00:25:07,808
itch your eye take your [ __ ] glove

797
00:25:07,028 --> 00:25:10,450
off your hand

798
00:25:07,808 --> 00:25:12,548
VIN it your eye I would almost consider

799
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:14,259
washing my hands before the itch take

800
00:25:12,548 --> 00:25:15,519
the glove off go wash the hand VIN

801
00:25:14,259 --> 00:25:16,569
scratch the eye but I understand

802
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:17,769
sometimes you just got to stick your

803
00:25:16,569 --> 00:25:19,749
finger in your eye cause shit's going

804
00:25:17,769 --> 00:25:22,690
weird take that glove off you guys don't

805
00:25:19,749 --> 00:25:25,389
put plant resin or trichomes in your eye

806
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:27,038
it will [ __ ] suck that's the

807
00:25:25,388 --> 00:25:28,658
technical term for it it [ __ ] sucks

808
00:25:27,038 --> 00:25:30,878
there's no other way to describe it it

809
00:25:28,659 --> 00:25:32,109
[ __ ] sucks you guys alright so I feel

810
00:25:30,878 --> 00:25:34,388
like I've given you a pretty good lesson

811
00:25:32,108 --> 00:25:37,089
on trimming I know I didn't teach you

812
00:25:34,388 --> 00:25:38,949
exactly how to trim the act of holding

813
00:25:37,089 --> 00:25:40,298
the bud and putting the scissors to it

814
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:41,619
is something you're going to have to

815
00:25:40,298 --> 00:25:43,628
experience you will develop your

816
00:25:41,618 --> 00:25:45,038
technique in your style I feel like I've

817
00:25:43,628 --> 00:25:46,388
given you a pretty good outline you know

818
00:25:45,038 --> 00:25:47,950
what to do with the product you know how

819
00:25:46,388 --> 00:25:50,558
to get it there you just need some

820
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:52,298
practice doing it get some buds and put

821
00:25:50,558 --> 00:25:53,470
some scissors to him that's the only way

822
00:25:52,298 --> 00:25:55,028
you're gonna get good at it it's the

823
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:57,729
only way you're gonna get faster at it

824
00:25:55,028 --> 00:25:59,769
when we hire new trimmers at the grow we

825
00:25:57,729 --> 00:26:01,389
don't always hire the people that claim

826
00:25:59,769 --> 00:26:02,919
to be the fastest trimmers we hire the

827
00:26:01,388 --> 00:26:04,358
people that interview well and seem like

828
00:26:02,919 --> 00:26:06,278
they're gonna fit in with the crew if

829
00:26:04,358 --> 00:26:08,108
they say they can only trim a half a

830
00:26:06,278 --> 00:26:09,819
pound of weed when they start that is

831
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:11,739
fine if that is real if they say they

832
00:26:09,819 --> 00:26:13,239
can trim a half a pound and they only do

833
00:26:11,739 --> 00:26:15,159
a quarter pound then I've got issues but

834
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:17,169
they say I can trim a half a pound in a

835
00:26:15,159 --> 00:26:19,119
day I'm fine with that we will train

836
00:26:17,169 --> 00:26:20,499
them we will teach them our system we'll

837
00:26:19,118 --> 00:26:21,848
teach them some tricks they'll get in

838
00:26:20,499 --> 00:26:23,710
they'll get a rhythm they'll get a

839
00:26:21,848 --> 00:26:25,658
routine and eventually they'll be

840
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:26,950
trimming a pound and a half a day so

841
00:26:25,659 --> 00:26:28,749
it's all about just finding the rhythm

842
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:29,980
it's all about finding the groove and it

843
00:26:28,749 --> 00:26:31,598
takes you a little bit of time and

844
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:32,849
experience to get in there and do it all

845
00:26:31,598 --> 00:26:34,819
so you

846
00:26:32,849 --> 00:26:37,139
our buds these are precious to people

847
00:26:34,819 --> 00:26:39,480
I've been in this industry for a long

848
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:41,040
time I can grab a flowering plant that's

849
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:42,900
a few days in and just cut that [ __ ]

850
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:44,069
down and feel no remorse or anything if

851
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:46,470
that's what needed to happen in a

852
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:48,000
commercial grow I kill the plant a lot

853
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:49,350
of people treat little buds like they're

854
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,269
the most precious thing they've ever

855
00:26:49,349 --> 00:26:52,559
seen which I respect you don't get to

856
00:26:51,269 --> 00:26:55,829
grow a bunch of plants I have produced

857
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:57,419
over a ton of cannabis in my life I am

858
00:26:55,829 --> 00:26:59,309
responsible for a ton of cannabis but

859
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:01,080
having been produced a lot of people

860
00:26:59,309 --> 00:27:03,210
don't have that under their belt so

861
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:05,429
every bud is precious to them they don't

862
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:07,140
want to [ __ ] up one single but I get

863
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:09,210
that so when they're new at it they go

864
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:11,100
really slow especially a higher trimmer

865
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:12,809
that is not their product that is your

866
00:27:11,099 --> 00:27:14,250
bud that they're playing with respect

867
00:27:12,809 --> 00:27:16,289
them for taking their time and going

868
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:18,359
slow with it but also encourage them to

869
00:27:16,289 --> 00:27:20,700
go faster you have to learn and go

870
00:27:18,359 --> 00:27:22,319
faster but people like to go slow in the

871
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:24,000
beginning because they're playing with

872
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:25,950
gold they don't they're playing with a

873
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,930
little pieces of gold they got little

874
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:29,220
babies in their hand and they're new so

875
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:31,380
they're kind of intimidated so keep that

876
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:32,460
in mind you'll get faster as time goes

877
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:33,480
on is what I'm trying to say you guys

878
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:34,950
you just need some practice you'll

879
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:36,900
become a good trimmer if you want to

880
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:38,370
become a good trimmer and if you want to

881
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:40,530
get your foot in the door in the

882
00:27:38,369 --> 00:27:42,839
commercial marijuana industry being a

883
00:27:40,529 --> 00:27:44,700
trimmer is probably the number one way

884
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:46,709
to get in the door trimmers and bud

885
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:47,670
tenders are how you get started so

886
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:50,400
trimming can be really time-consuming

887
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:52,769
and tedious but it is the last step

888
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:54,990
before you claim victory in your garden

889
00:27:52,769 --> 00:27:56,970
if your garden is for sale you're one

890
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:59,309
step away from money if your garden is

891
00:27:56,970 --> 00:28:03,029
for medicinal uses you're one step away

892
00:27:59,309 --> 00:28:05,399
from feeling better so trimming sucks

893
00:28:03,029 --> 00:28:07,410
but you're almost there it's it's the

894
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:09,180
hardest most time-consuming tedious part

895
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:11,759
in my opinion it is my least favorite

896
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:14,190
part but it is one step away from sweet

897
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:16,140
success all right podcast ruled I hope

898
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:17,730
this trimming lesson made sense again

899
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:20,040
the only way to get good at trimming is

900
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:21,390
to get sticky and get some practice get

901
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:23,069
in there get your gloves dirty get your

902
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:24,810
scissors all sticky and start trimming

903
00:28:23,069 --> 00:28:26,399
up some weed if you want to learn and

904
00:28:24,809 --> 00:28:28,679
you've got friends that are harvesting

905
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:30,269
volunteer to trim for free everybody

906
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:31,410
could use a free trimmer and we know

907
00:28:30,269 --> 00:28:33,150
we're gonna have to teach you that's

908
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:34,290
fine but we hope that in a few harvests

909
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:36,269
you're gonna show up and you're gonna

910
00:28:34,289 --> 00:28:38,009

912

913

915
00:28:44,009 --> 00:28:47,279

well I may in the future release some

00:29:56,730 --> 00:30:00,870
paid content which will be bonus content

951
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:03,539
but this version of the podcast in this

952
00:30:00,869 --> 00:30:05,549
format always will be free iTunes

953
00:30:03,539 --> 00:30:07,559
stitcher and the YouTube channel as it

954
00:30:05,549 --> 00:30:09,659
is will always be free I do this because

955
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:11,159
I love cannabis and I love you and I

956
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:14,340
want you to be able to medicate and

957
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:16,019
wreck create the best ways possible with

958
00:30:14,339 --> 00:30:17,849
the highest quality cleanest safest

959
00:30:16,019 --> 00:30:19,650
products available and I think the only

960
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:21,179
way you can do that is by growing it

961
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:22,890
yourself so I've got to teach you how to

962
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:25,650
do that so that you don't have to rely

963
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:27,509
on anybody else so my point is that the

964
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:28,950
podcast will be free but I know there

965
00:30:27,509 --> 00:30:30,480
are people out there who would like to

966
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:31,920
contribute because they emailed me and

967
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,259
they said hey Jeff how can we help you

968
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:37,110

969
00:30:34,259 --> 00:30:39,900
that patreon.com slash grow from your

970
00:30:37,109 --> 00:30:41,579
