00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,379
support group in Denver at a place

65
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:16,569
called Castleman's

66
00:02:14,379 --> 00:02:18,099
and I was granted a 10-minute interview

67
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:19,269
with the lovely Charlo Greene so I'll

68
00:02:18,099 --> 00:02:21,669
play that here in just a few minutes

69
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:24,969
before I get to that I want to read a

70
00:02:21,669 --> 00:02:28,089
news article you turn on the music this

71
00:02:24,969 --> 00:02:30,580
article actually comes from the extract

72
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:33,700
sun-times dot-com I found this on the

73
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:35,500
Internet of course lately there have

74
00:02:33,699 --> 00:02:36,819
been some revelations made in the

75
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,530
cannabis industry if you've got a

76
00:02:36,819 --> 00:02:40,209
commercial grow or a private grow you

77
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:42,340
may want to hear this if you're using a

78
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:44,140
product called Guardian you need to get

79
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:46,360
that stuff out of your garden out of

80
00:02:44,139 --> 00:02:47,979
your place just get rid of it it is not

81
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,120
something you want to be spraying so

82
00:02:47,979 --> 00:02:51,429
let's get right into the article here

83
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,909
I'm looking for an author here it says

84
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:57,040
written by Emily gray Brocius alright so

85
00:02:54,909 --> 00:02:58,359
this article was posted on January 21st

86
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:00,699
and it goes like this

87
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:02,410
a popular pesticide approved last week

88
00:03:00,699 --> 00:03:04,060
by Oregon health officials for use on

89
00:03:02,409 --> 00:03:05,829
cannabis plants has now been removed

90
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:08,110
from the list of acceptable marijuana

91
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:09,880
pesticides due to detection of a

92
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:12,400
controversial chemical ingredient as

93
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:14,199
reported by The Oregonian and guys this

94
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,760
is an article from Oregon but soon you

95
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:18,939
will see how this applies to you a

96
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:21,399
marijuana testing lab in Eugene found

97
00:03:18,939 --> 00:03:22,960
traces of the chemical abom ekdam and

98
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,730
supposedly organically grown cannabis

99
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:26,909
and discovered growers had been using a

100
00:03:24,729 --> 00:03:29,169
pesticide called Guardian might spray

101
00:03:26,909 --> 00:03:31,180
Guardian might spray includes natural

102
00:03:29,169 --> 00:03:33,729
ingredients such as lemon oil and

103
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:35,409
cinnamon among its active ingredients

104
00:03:33,729 --> 00:03:38,799
and is marketed as an all-natural

105
00:03:35,409 --> 00:03:40,270
product abom Ekman was not listed as an

106
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,520
active ingredient on the product label

107
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:44,320
the pesticide has become widely popular

108
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:46,719
because it's more effective than any

109
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:48,639
harsh chemicals Neal Bernstein owner of

110
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:50,919
roots garden supply told the orgo nyan

111
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:52,689
of course it's more effective they're

112
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:55,750
lying in their shin they didn't tell you

113
00:03:52,689 --> 00:03:57,129
about I'll continue to read Oregon's

114
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:59,229
Department of Agriculture has

115
00:03:57,129 --> 00:04:00,939
temporarily removed the product from its

116
00:03:59,229 --> 00:04:02,709
list of approved cannabis pesticides

117
00:04:00,939 --> 00:04:04,750
until further investigation can be

118
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:06,280
conducted Abba magnin is commonly used

119
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:08,169
in fruit and vegetable production but

120
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,159
those produce items are not marketed or

121
00:04:08,169 --> 00:04:11,469
sold as organic

122
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:13,539
according to Green Rush daily detection

123
00:04:11,469 --> 00:04:15,430
of this chemical an allegedly organic

124
00:04:13,539 --> 00:04:16,988
marijuana is problematic because people

125
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:19,209
often pay a higher premium for

126
00:04:16,988 --> 00:04:22,089
organically grown cannabis especially

127
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:24,189
medical marijuana patients so this

128
00:04:22,089 --> 00:04:26,769
company was putting out a pesticide and

129
00:04:24,189 --> 00:04:28,240
they were having great success with it

130
00:04:26,769 --> 00:04:30,370
it was taking down all of the problem

131
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,259
but they were not listing the album

132
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:35,350
Ekman on the label which is not an

133
00:04:32,259 --> 00:04:38,348
organic compound or chemical and it was

134
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:40,000
clearly in the product so there may be

135
00:04:38,348 --> 00:04:41,649
if this was if this was a rule in

136
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,199
Colorado if this product was banned in

137
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:46,388
Colorado and this was applied to a crop

138
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:48,310
in Colorado and a lab found this that

139
00:04:46,389 --> 00:04:50,139
crop would be recalled and none of the

140
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:51,879
products made with the trim or the buds

141
00:04:50,139 --> 00:04:53,800
of that crop would be allowed to be sold

142
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:55,719
in a dispensary the product would all

143
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:59,800
have to be destroyed people would lose a

144
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:01,300
lot of money I hope the people for

145
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:04,120
Guardian are held accountable when that

146
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:06,069
time comes it's a gray area because

147
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:08,110
cannabis is federally illegal I don't

148
00:05:06,069 --> 00:05:09,819
know if we can sue for that but if crops

149
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:11,189
have to be thrown away because Guardian

150
00:05:09,819 --> 00:05:13,389
was applied and there was a an

151
00:05:11,189 --> 00:05:15,189
ingredient not listed on the label I

152
00:05:13,389 --> 00:05:18,490
hope the folks from Guardian can be held

153
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:19,870
accountable for that um I have posted to

154
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:21,490
Facebook that I'm trying to get in touch

155
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:23,680
with the people from Guardian their

156
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:25,418
website is gone the distributors and

157
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,759
vendors that I was aware of for Guardian

158
00:05:25,418 --> 00:05:29,589

like to know why that was not listed on

179
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:07,750
the label of your product I'm sure you

180
00:06:06,579 --> 00:06:10,029
knew it was in there because you had to

181
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:12,218
pay for it to put it in the product all

182
00:06:10,029 --> 00:06:14,198
right and if anybody else has guardian

183
00:06:12,218 --> 00:06:17,348
in their garden or in your garden pantry

184
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:19,000
area properly dispose of that I honestly

185
00:06:17,348 --> 00:06:20,829
do not know the proper procedure for

186
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,750
disposing of a bottle of pesticides but

187
00:06:20,829 --> 00:06:24,098
please do some research and get rid of

188
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:26,620
that stuff if you've already applied

189
00:06:24,098 --> 00:06:29,589
guardian to your personal crop you

190
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:31,090
should be okay it's not organic anymore

191
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:32,739
you can't say it was organic it's not

192
00:06:31,089 --> 00:06:33,968
going to kill you and if you've got a

193
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:37,478
commercial crop and you've applied

194
00:06:33,968 --> 00:06:39,199
Guardian in Colorado I hope you pass all

195
00:06:37,478 --> 00:06:40,819
of the testing when it comes up

196
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,899
you guys if you're thinking about making

197
00:06:40,819 --> 00:06:44,149
a product for the cannabis community

198
00:06:41,899 --> 00:06:46,039
think long-term these guys weren't

199
00:06:44,149 --> 00:06:47,449
around very long if they would have made

200
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,680
a product that worked and put some

201
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:49,909
thought into it and put some heart into

202
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,439
it they'd still be part of the community

203
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:53,780
we'd still be giving them our money

204
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:56,719
instead they tried to pull some [ __ ] on

205
00:06:53,779 --> 00:06:58,069
us and now they have to hide that are

206
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,210
shunned from the cannabis community no

207
00:06:58,069 --> 00:07:00,409
one's ever gonna trust these people

208
00:06:59,209 --> 00:07:00,799
again whoever they are if you know who

209
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:02,000
they are

210
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,350
you're never gonna buy a product from

211
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,370
them again if you're a sales rep from

212
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:06,530
that company people are gonna have a

213
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:07,850
hard time trusting you the legal

214
00:07:06,529 --> 00:07:08,389
cannabis industry is just getting

215
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:11,000
started

216
00:07:08,389 --> 00:07:12,769
and if you're as part of this evolution

217
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,230
of the cannabis industry before it goes

218
00:07:12,769 --> 00:07:17,000
nationwide you'd have the opportunity to

219
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:18,770
be in a huge business but instead these

220
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,350
guys pretty much just got blackballed so

221
00:07:18,769 --> 00:07:23,599
don't be these guys grow from your heart

222
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:25,520
be a good person alright guys I'm going

223
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:27,470

224
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:30,349

very great interview this was the first

229
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,490
interview I've ever had where the person

230
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:42,980
I was interviewing had an assistant who

231
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:44,870
was keeping time she told me you have 10

232
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:45,860
minutes when the interview started she

233
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:47,269
put her hands up it showed me ten

234
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:49,430
minutes when nine minutes happened she

235
00:07:47,269 --> 00:07:51,049
showed me nine when five minutes came

236
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:52,939
around she showed me the five when three

237
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:54,680
minutes came up I got the three about

238
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:55,759
one minute kind of gave me the look so I

239
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,620
know it's time to wrap up the interview

240
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,930
miss Charlotte was on a tight schedule

241
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:01,730
so I do appreciate her for taking a

242
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:03,829
10-minute chunk out of her night to do

243
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:05,540

thank you for having me Jeff this is a

255
00:08:32,389 --> 00:08:34,639
great event that a lot of people here

256
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,050
already it's kind of early and we still

257
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:37,819
already getting people right we're

258
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:39,348
filling up I think this shows just how

259
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:42,379
excited people are for this opportunity

260
00:08:39,349 --> 00:08:44,600
to share their own experiences and learn

261
00:08:42,379 --> 00:08:47,360
I mean now that you guys have passed

262
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:49,310
that barrier that most of the rest of us

263
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,899
are fighting for we're all watching to

264
00:08:49,309 --> 00:08:52,459
see what you do and the fact that so

265
00:08:50,899 --> 00:08:54,709
many people are taking initiative to

266
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:56,420
educate themselves it's encouraging

267
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:58,340
education that's the key here tonight as

268
00:08:56,419 --> 00:08:59,929
Nicky I see a lot of vendors here

269
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:01,190
everybody has their educational info

270
00:08:59,929 --> 00:09:02,479
it's not like they're here doing a swap

271
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:04,220
meet trying to sell I love the vibe that

272
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,750
people have brought it's more of an

273
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:07,220
educational and not give me your money

274
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:10,340
which is what we've needed in this

275
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:12,170
industry exactly it's a service that's

276
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:13,790
what it is it's not a trade show it's

277
00:09:12,169 --> 00:09:14,929
not a fair so I appreciate it thank you

278

for doing that for us

279
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:17,000
it seems like every time we have an

280
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:22,699
event like this they're just trying to

281
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:24,230
pull money out of our pockets we

282
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:26,210

283

295
00:09:50,779 --> 00:09:54,559
well-known for your [ __ ] I quit

296
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:56,149
statement on the news yes

297
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:58,039
a lot of my listeners might not be

298
00:09:56,149 --> 00:10:00,980
familiar with who you are can you give

299
00:09:58,039 --> 00:10:02,389
us maybe a brief history lesson up to

300
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:05,090
today and then we'll talk about the

301
00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:07,850
event sure I was working as a news

302
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:09,769
anchor in Anchorage Alaska I became the

303
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:11,810
cannabis reporter and I learned about

304
00:10:09,769 --> 00:10:14,449
the true Hannah harms surrounding

305
00:10:11,809 --> 00:10:16,699
cannabis prohibition I was able to meet

306
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:19,430
the patients that were being affected by

307
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:21,110
our broken medical marijuana system and

308
00:10:19,429 --> 00:10:24,259
I knew that I was probably the only

309
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:27,080
person with the knowledge and resources

310
00:10:24,259 --> 00:10:29,059
and access in order to do something in

311
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:31,699
order to help so many people that needed

312
00:10:29,059 --> 00:10:33,409
it so I created the Alaska cannabis

313
00:10:31,698 --> 00:10:35,418
while still working as a reporter and

314
00:10:33,409 --> 00:10:38,208
decided I would build the club up and

315
00:10:35,418 --> 00:10:40,399
step away from my career as a journalist

316
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:42,828
and I decided to do so in a public

317
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:45,409
manner so I had one of the club's

318
00:10:42,828 --> 00:10:47,238
youngest patients his name Solomon and

319
00:10:45,409 --> 00:10:51,980
he was battling testicular cancer

320
00:10:47,239 --> 00:10:53,418
he decided he'll he agreed to not

321
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:56,119
disclose the fact that me his

322
00:10:53,418 --> 00:10:58,399
interviewer was also the weed Li he was

323
00:10:56,119 --> 00:11:01,278
doing the story about and so that

324
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,749
pre-taped segment aired I let the

325
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:04,668
teleprompter run with something

326
00:11:02,749 --> 00:11:06,230
completely different from what I planned

327
00:11:04,668 --> 00:11:08,448
on saying and I just spoke from my heart

328
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:10,039
and I told everyone that I owned the

329
00:11:08,448 --> 00:11:11,808
Alaska cannabis Club and that I'd be

330
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:14,748
quitting my job to fight for freedom and

331
00:11:11,808 --> 00:11:17,838
fairness and as for this job well [ __ ]

332
00:11:14,749 --> 00:11:19,790
it I quit and so that led to more than a

333
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:22,819
hundred million views countless

334
00:11:19,789 --> 00:11:24,738
headlines we rallied freedom fighters

335
00:11:22,818 --> 00:11:27,618
across the state of Alaska across the

336
00:11:24,739 --> 00:11:29,298
world really but in Alaska we got as

337
00:11:27,619 --> 00:11:31,399
many people registered to vote in that

338
00:11:29,298 --> 00:11:33,678
short span of time that we had left and

339
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:36,139
then from there was all about education

340
00:11:33,678 --> 00:11:38,178
education education so we criss crossed

341
00:11:36,139 --> 00:11:41,209
the massive state of Alaska just sharing

342
00:11:38,178 --> 00:11:44,480
our own experiences sharing where we

343
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:47,479
came from and addressing real concerns

344
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:50,119
that our neighbors had and that led to

345
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:52,879
the legalization of marijuana in Alaska

346
00:11:50,119 --> 00:11:54,499
on November 4th of 2014 well thank you

347
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:55,699
for uh putting your future and your

348
00:11:54,499 --> 00:11:57,048
career on the line

349
00:11:55,698 --> 00:11:58,188
if that didn't work the way it was

350
00:11:57,048 --> 00:12:02,499
supposed to you could have really put

351
00:11:58,188 --> 00:12:02,498
yourself in a hole it was gonna work

352
00:12:02,918 --> 00:12:06,980
that's an amazing step to make an

353
00:12:04,909 --> 00:12:08,899
amazing commitment to make thank you I

354
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:10,249
it was the right thing to do I became a

355
00:12:08,899 --> 00:12:12,259
journalist because I wanted to make a

356
00:12:10,249 --> 00:12:13,879
difference and this was an opportunity

357
00:12:12,259 --> 00:12:15,350
to make a real difference there's no

358
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:16,909
difference to be made in journalism

359
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:20,239
because the network's kind of limit you

360
00:12:16,909 --> 00:12:23,958
don't they control the truth with me

361
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:25,910
awesome so that brings us to today here

362
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:28,278
at the cannabis patients what is it the

363
00:12:25,909 --> 00:12:29,988
cannabis patient support group we kind

364
00:12:28,278 --> 00:12:31,220
of talked about it a little bit ago can

365
00:12:29,989 --> 00:12:32,449
you give us a bunch of details about

366
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:34,038
this and who's here and what we're gonna

367
00:12:32,448 --> 00:12:38,928
do today and what we're gonna hear right

368
00:12:34,038 --> 00:12:41,720
well right now cannabis patients from

369
00:12:38,928 --> 00:12:43,818
all walks of life all different ailments

370
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:45,440
are coming together and sharing their

371
00:12:43,818 --> 00:12:47,269
own experiences this is again

372
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,970
gathering that's the first of its kind

373
00:12:47,269 --> 00:12:52,909
where it isn't just Crohn's patients or

374
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:55,129
patients suffering HIV or dealing with

375
00:12:52,909 --> 00:12:57,319
cancer everyone is coming together so

376
00:12:55,129 --> 00:12:59,779
that we can share the knowledge and and

377
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:03,140
we know that we're all growing and

378
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:05,569
learning and that no one is the end-all

379
00:13:03,139 --> 00:13:07,340
expert in this it's important that we

380
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:10,129
all just continue sharing what we're

381
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:12,080
learning so we get to where we have

382
00:13:10,129 --> 00:13:13,789
those direct answers and it is and

383
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:16,070
everyone's still feeling their way

384
00:13:13,789 --> 00:13:17,179
through their treatment you know it is

385
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:19,129
still a little foggy out there the

386
00:13:17,179 --> 00:13:20,599
doctors can guide you very well you've

387
00:13:19,129 --> 00:13:21,950
got blood tenders at dispensaries that

388
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:24,590
are basically in charge of your medicine

389
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:26,240
or caregivers exactly and when we're

390
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:27,680
talking about medicine and how this

391
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,450
would be handled by someone that's gone

392
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:31,939
to school for years and years and can

393
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:33,950
tell you exactly down to a science how

394
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:36,740
it's going to be affecting you that's

395
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:39,110
what we're working toward as as an

396
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:41,210
industry as a medical marijuana

397
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:43,250
community and so this is one of those

398
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:44,269
steps in that direction I really look

399
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,440

411
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:09,740
Haines

Bobby West Ashlee Webber and a few more

413
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:13,549
that will really touch hearts and open

414
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:15,139
minds great I hope to get some of that

415
00:14:13,549 --> 00:14:17,629
onto the show everything comes out well

416
00:14:15,139 --> 00:14:18,559
so I follow you on every social media

417
00:14:17,629 --> 00:14:20,689
outlet that there is you're quite

418
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:22,879
popular on the social media a little

419
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:25,550
while back the Alaskan cannabis club was

420
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:26,929
raided it was very few minutes after

421
00:14:25,549 --> 00:14:27,469
that you went to Facebook and posted a

422
00:14:26,929 --> 00:14:30,259
video

423
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:35,000
you seemed calmer in that video than you

424
00:14:30,259 --> 00:14:37,250
do right now police were here again I

425
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,019
mean it just is what it is if that's

426
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:41,960
what's happening now then people need to

427
00:14:39,019 --> 00:14:44,870
know it if we voted to stop something

428
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:46,639
from happening and police and the

429
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:48,049
authorities are circumventing the will

430
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:50,059
of the voters then everyone needs to

431
00:14:48,049 --> 00:14:52,129
know what's happening now so that people

432
00:14:50,059 --> 00:14:53,929
can show up and they did show up because

433
00:14:52,129 --> 00:14:55,070
of that how many times has that Club

434
00:14:53,929 --> 00:14:58,639
been rated

435
00:14:55,070 --> 00:15:00,050
we've been raided twice much comfortable

436
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,699
with the routine now you know it's not

437
00:15:00,049 --> 00:15:03,769
comfortable I mean it's a horrible

438
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:06,050
experience no one should have a gun

439
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:08,179
shoved in their face because of cannabis

440
00:15:06,049 --> 00:15:10,789
cannabis I agree that's absurd we're not

441
00:15:08,179 --> 00:15:12,979
hurting anybody exactly and the fact

442
00:15:10,789 --> 00:15:14,990
that they felt the need to send more

443
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:16,909
than a dozen armed officers and SWAT

444
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:21,230
gear into my home to put guns in all of

445
00:15:16,909 --> 00:15:25,069
our faces it's it's sad you look like a

446
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:27,680
pretty badass criminal I know right so

447
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:29,629
threatening one of the violent offenders

448
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:31,250
well I was impressed with how calmly you

449
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:32,389
went on Facebook just minutes after and

450
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:34,250
you're like we just got raided I was

451
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:35,480
definitely impressed so that has to be a

452
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,980
little bit of reporter experience but

453
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,210
I'm sure that's just your character so

454
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:40,940
that was awesome thank you well thank

455
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:42,530
you that was amazing so I've done a lot

456
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:44,690
of interview questions I kind of wanted

457
00:15:42,529 --> 00:15:47,240
to have a little bit of fun how do you

458
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:48,560
prefer to consume cannabis well it

459
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:51,680
depends on what I'm going for

460
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:59,869
okay I'm going for a calming effect that

461
00:15:51,679 --> 00:16:02,629
I like a CBD spray okay when I want to

462
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:04,460
just relax and chill then of course I

463
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:06,919

you guys I recorded the whole thing

540
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,519
unfortunately the sound quality was not

541
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:57,589
super good it was not their fault it was

542
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:59,569
my fault I just used my zoom h6 a little

543
00:18:57,589 --> 00:19:00,919
XY mic I didn't pick it up real well

544
00:18:59,569 --> 00:19:02,240
there was a lot of room noise there's a

545
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:04,640
lot of conversation in the back of the

546
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,140
room so I'm not gonna torture you guys

547
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,120
by making you listen to that I do

548
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:09,590
recommend that you go to a Denver

549
00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:11,659
patient support group if you ever get

550
00:19:09,589 --> 00:19:13,639
the opportunity if there is a medical

551
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:15,529
marijuana on a support group in your

552
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:17,420
area I highly recommend that you go to

553
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:19,279
that go mingle with the patients go hear

554
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:21,710
the testimony of these people whose

555
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:24,619
lives are being dramatically improved by

556
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:27,230
using medical cannabis several patients

557
00:19:24,619 --> 00:19:28,489
took the stage to speak and one patient

558
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:31,370
that really stood out in my mind was a

559
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:33,589
young man who said that he had the

560
00:19:31,369 --> 00:19:35,569
opportunity to move to Colorado and use

561
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:37,129
medical cannabis to feel better and he

562
00:19:35,569 --> 00:19:39,079
feels much better now he's able to run

563
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:40,820
he's able to play he's able to jump he's

564
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:42,949
able to be a normal kid with energy but

565
00:19:40,819 --> 00:19:44,419
the only downfall is it now he doesn't

566
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:46,400
care to do that because all of his

567
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:49,370
friends are in his home state where they

568
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,570
do not allow medical cannabis so you can

569
00:19:49,369 --> 00:19:52,459
go to these meetings you can hear this

570
00:19:50,569 --> 00:19:54,079
testimony if you don't believe in the

571
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:55,309
power of medical cannabis go to one of

572
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:56,599

573
00:19:55,309 --> 00:19:59,779
children talk here's some of these

574
00:19:56,599 --> 00:20:02,569
adults talk some of these people develop

575
00:19:59,779 --> 00:20:03,920
these conditions at adulthood some of

576
00:20:02,569 --> 00:20:05,359
these people weren't car accidents and

577
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:07,370
developed conditions then some of these

578
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:08,839
