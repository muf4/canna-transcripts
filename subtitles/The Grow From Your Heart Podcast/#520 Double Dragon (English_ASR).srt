00:02:38,789 --> 00:02:57,120
show all you have to do is visit

74
00:02:41,389 --> 00:02:58,859
www.reimaverick.com an I did say that I

75
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,439
was going to do a strain feature on

76
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:02,040
Double Dragon so let's jump right into

77
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:04,829
it

78
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:08,310
what is double dragon double dragon is a

79
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:10,950
cross of my arise male cross to a Durban

80
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:14,280
poison female so let's talk briefly

81
00:03:10,949 --> 00:03:16,649
about my arise male arise is a golden

82
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,629
goat to Daybreaker cross golden goat has

83
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:20,969
a really sweet tropical sort of a flavor

84
00:03:18,629 --> 00:03:23,009
kind of a sativa dominant head buzz to

85
00:03:20,969 --> 00:03:25,020
that plant then on the other side we've

86
00:03:23,009 --> 00:03:27,419
got the day breaker that is CEM D to

87
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:29,880
Joseph OG so we've got CEM dog aromas

88
00:03:27,419 --> 00:03:31,769
we've got Oh G kosher Roma's it's got

89
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:34,049
funk to it it's got cush it's got gas

90
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:36,210
it's got fuel it's got some odd funky

91
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:38,340
aromas which I really enjoy it makes a

92
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:40,439
gigantic leaves and it's got that more

93
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:43,080
punch you in the face sit you down kind

94
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:44,639
of a buzz so by crossing the golden goat

95
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,440
and the Daybreaker there was a lot of

96
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:48,359
contrast in those two plants I knew I

97
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:50,520
could make a really vigorous and a

98
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:53,490
really new hybrid so I crossed those

99
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:55,710
that creation was known as a rise I've

100
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:57,270
done a full episode about arise if you

101
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:59,159
search grow from your heart or rise it

102
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:01,800
will pop up very quickly check that

103
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:04,079
episode out learn all about arise the

104
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:06,439
mail that I used in this cross for

105
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:09,570
Double Dragon was a specially selected

106
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:12,689
male arise plant who has been called

107
00:04:09,569 --> 00:04:15,509
King Solomon King Solomon has made many

108
00:04:12,689 --> 00:04:17,399
many successful crosses everything he

109
00:04:15,509 --> 00:04:19,529
touches he puts more resin on the

110
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:20,129
outcome he puts more vigor into the

111
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:22,379
outcome

112
00:04:20,129 --> 00:04:24,569
King Solomon has become known as the

113
00:04:22,379 --> 00:04:26,430
plant fixer if you've got a female plant

114
00:04:24,569 --> 00:04:27,240
that grows well but it's got a problem

115
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:29,129
you can

116
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,139
probably pollinate it with King Solomon

117
00:04:29,129 --> 00:04:33,300
and we will fix it and make that plant

118
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:34,740
the offspring will be even better than

119
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:37,770
both plants which is the goal in

120
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:41,129
breeding so King Solomon passes on high

121
00:04:37,769 --> 00:04:43,859
THC and great potency he also passes on

122
00:04:41,129 --> 00:04:46,110
hyper vigour he also passes on a very

123
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:49,050
nice structure and he also gives very

124
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:51,300
good resistance to mold and mildew so it

125
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:53,069
is a great male plant to work with now

126
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:55,228
let's talk about the other side of this

127
00:04:53,069 --> 00:04:58,259
cross the female in this cross I used

128
00:04:55,228 --> 00:05:00,209
was a Durban poison there is a Durban

129
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:02,460
poison cut that travels through the

130
00:05:00,209 --> 00:05:04,948
colorado commercial grow industry and

131
00:05:02,459 --> 00:05:07,649
that is the exact cut that i used if you

132
00:05:04,949 --> 00:05:10,139
have purchased Durban poison in Colorado

133
00:05:07,649 --> 00:05:11,848
in the past couple of years especially

134
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:14,460
in the southern Colorado area

135
00:05:11,848 --> 00:05:16,769
it was probably grown from the exact cut

136
00:05:14,459 --> 00:05:19,138
which I am using it's got that black

137
00:05:16,769 --> 00:05:21,269
licorice and it smell to it a little bit

138
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:22,530
of sweetness depending on what nutrients

139
00:05:21,269 --> 00:05:24,389
it's grown with and how it's done

140
00:05:22,529 --> 00:05:25,978
sometimes it gets a little funky or

141
00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:27,810
sometimes it gets a little sweeter if

142
00:05:25,978 --> 00:05:30,120
they do it just right that Anacin

143
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:31,889
licorice smell really really pops when

144
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,199
you smoke it it brings out maybe a hint

145
00:05:31,889 --> 00:05:36,300
of mint in the flavor but it stays real

146
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:38,370
anise and licorice E and it's got that

147
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:41,490
that mint sort of an aftertaste to it

148
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:43,560
and if you do it right it is such a head

149
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:45,810
Ripper it will rip your head off I've

150
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,848
noticed the THC a test don't come out

151
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:50,819
super high on the Durbin poison but when

152
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:52,439
I smoke it I get [ __ ] high from it I

153
00:05:50,819 --> 00:05:54,629
get hired from the Durbin poison than a

154
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:56,848
lot of other strains I've noticed when I

155
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:59,310
smoked the Durbin poison and also the

156
00:05:56,848 --> 00:06:01,259
Double Dragon that my eyes get bloody

157
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:03,449
bloody red it does something to my eyes

158
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:05,520
it's almost like a psychedelic panic

159
00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:07,288
attack sort of a high for some people

160
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:09,538
that can be overwhelming that sounds a

161
00:06:07,288 --> 00:06:11,759
little on unappealing or unappetizing

162
00:06:09,538 --> 00:06:13,468
for me that is right where I want to be

163
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,330
if you can get me right to that level

164
00:06:13,468 --> 00:06:17,579
where I'm like oh [ __ ] that's how high I

165
00:06:15,329 --> 00:06:18,718
want to be is oh [ __ ] that I like that

166
00:06:17,579 --> 00:06:21,029
when you're like what was i doing where

167
00:06:18,718 --> 00:06:23,158
am i I'm lost that's what I'm smoking

168
00:06:21,029 --> 00:06:24,929
for sometimes that's what I enjoy you

169
00:06:23,158 --> 00:06:27,060
can get that from the Durbin poison and

170
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:29,908
you can absolutely get that from the

171
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:32,819
Double Dragon so the cross is the female

172
00:06:29,908 --> 00:06:35,278
double dragon crossed to the male arise

173
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:37,650
plant which was known as King Solomon so

174
00:06:35,278 --> 00:06:40,709
those are the parents so a moment ago I

175
00:06:37,649 --> 00:06:42,269
called King Solomon the plant fixer

176
00:06:40,709 --> 00:06:43,799
if I have got a plant that doesn't grow

177
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:45,629
the way I wanted to or doesn't produce

178
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,310
the way I need it to or it's just

179
00:06:45,629 --> 00:06:49,139
lacking in something maybe it's got all

180
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:50,639
the Terps but not the potency maybe it's

181
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:53,550
got all the potency and not the Terps

182
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:56,038
maybe it grows funny I can pollinate it

183
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:59,009
with King Solomon and nine times out of

184
00:06:56,038 --> 00:07:01,439
ten the outcome will be better than both

185
00:06:59,009 --> 00:07:04,139
parent plants and I will do what I have

186
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:06,719
called fixing the original plant so in

187
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:08,699
this case I had that Durban poison cut

188
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,220
and there were a couple of things I did

189
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:13,110
not like about that cut the main thing I

190
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:15,060
didn't like is just the way that it grew

191
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:16,919
the structure the way the plant branched

192
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,329
out the way it drew kind of sideways the

193
00:07:16,918 --> 00:07:19,948
way it kind of branched out weird it

194
00:07:18,329 --> 00:07:21,719
didn't go straight up they wanted to

195
00:07:19,949 --> 00:07:23,490
make Viney branches it needed a lot of

196
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,710
work a lot of support a lot of attention

197
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:28,139
it wasn't working well in a commercial

198
00:07:25,709 --> 00:07:29,969
environment we kept growing it we worked

199
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:32,610
with it I could make it work in a grow

200
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:34,710
because people really wanted that Durban

201
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:36,330
poison it has a good reputation and it

202
00:07:34,709 --> 00:07:39,029
flies off the shelves who is worth the

203
00:07:36,329 --> 00:07:41,819
pain in the ass grow but I knew I could

204
00:07:39,029 --> 00:07:44,939
fix it by breeding it to my King Solomon

205
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:47,098
so my main goal was to improve the

206
00:07:44,939 --> 00:07:49,228
structure and shape of that plant and

207
00:07:47,098 --> 00:07:50,519
improve the way the branches grow I

208
00:07:49,228 --> 00:07:52,139
guess that is just the shape and

209
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:54,240
structure that's what I wanted to fix I

210
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:56,280
wanted to make it a more vigorous more

211
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,050
commercially viable plant is what I

212
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:59,489
think my goal was I love that Durban

213
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:01,770
poison but in a commercial environment

214
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:03,930
it slowed us down we did not reach goals

215
00:08:01,769 --> 00:08:05,788
because of it but it was so amazingly

216
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:08,728
flavorful and potent that we kept it

217
00:08:05,788 --> 00:08:11,038
around so my main goal was to fix that

218
00:08:08,728 --> 00:08:13,348
growth my second goal was to keep that

219
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:15,658
Durban poisoned flavor and aroma in the

220
00:08:13,348 --> 00:08:17,908
cross and my third hope was that we

221
00:08:15,658 --> 00:08:20,939
would get that amazing Durban poison

222
00:08:17,908 --> 00:08:23,339
head Ripper buzz that super slanty eyes

223
00:08:20,939 --> 00:08:25,620
the red eyes the amazing cottonmouth the

224
00:08:23,339 --> 00:08:28,439
time travel hi I was hoping we would get

225
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:31,110
that out of the cross and in most

226
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:33,389
phenotypes I do find that we get that

227
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:35,940
Durban poison flavor most of them have

228
00:08:33,389 --> 00:08:38,519
that rip and rip and hi and they all

229
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:40,680
grow quite a bit better than that

230
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:43,139
original Durban poison cross so I feel

231
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:45,870
like I did hit my goal however there are

232
00:08:43,139 --> 00:08:48,000
more phenotypes than I anticipated or

233
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:50,190
expected in this breeding project most

234
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,958
of the time I see two or three maybe

235
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:53,910
three or four solid phenotypes that I

236
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:54,419
can kind of categorize and identify I

237
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:56,159
can say

238
00:08:54,419 --> 00:08:57,870
oh those traits are happening because of

239
00:08:56,159 --> 00:09:00,059
this parent that's happening because of

240
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:03,028
this parent I see quite a bit of

241
00:09:00,059 --> 00:09:05,309
variation in the Double Dragon keep in

242
00:09:03,028 --> 00:09:06,720
mind that this is just the f1 version of

243
00:09:05,309 --> 00:09:09,119
the Double Dragon that I'm playing with

244
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,430
I have not made f twos yet I will be

245
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,889
able to lock in phenotypes and lock in

246
00:09:11,429 --> 00:09:16,620
traits as I so desire I just have not

247
00:09:13,889 --> 00:09:18,329
made that step into the project yet so

248
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:19,828
at this point I am seeing several

249
00:09:18,328 --> 00:09:21,599
phenotypes we will discuss the

250
00:09:19,828 --> 00:09:23,969
phenotypes in just a little bit let's

251
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,579
talk more about growing the plan Double

252
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:29,100
Dragon is a very fast and very

253
00:09:26,578 --> 00:09:31,319
vigorously growing plant I say that a

254
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:33,778
lot about most of the strains I put out

255
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:36,420
but it is an f1 hybrid so it does

256
00:09:33,778 --> 00:09:39,389
contain that hyper vigor and also King

257
00:09:36,419 --> 00:09:42,028
Solomon gives plants extra hyper vigor

258
00:09:39,389 --> 00:09:43,829
so is going to grow very quickly now

259
00:09:42,028 --> 00:09:45,659
something I find interesting about some

260
00:09:43,828 --> 00:09:47,569
of the phenotypes of this plant is that

261
00:09:45,659 --> 00:09:49,828
it wants to get stretchy and grow

262
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:52,260
horizontally instead of vertically it

263
00:09:49,828 --> 00:09:54,149
wants to go out and stretch sideways and

264
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:55,799
get wider instead of growing up and

265
00:09:54,149 --> 00:09:57,899
getting taller so some of these

266
00:09:55,799 --> 00:10:00,689
phenotypes will require some sort of

267
00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:02,759
sticks or netting or tomato cages or

268
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:05,010
something to make it grow up otherwise

269
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:07,588
you will just have a low-lying bush that

270
00:10:05,009 --> 00:10:09,360
keeps going out and sideways if that is

271
00:10:07,589 --> 00:10:11,190
what you want that will work beautifully

272
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,039
for you but that is not what most

273
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:15,390
cannabis growers are looking for

274
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:16,948
Dumbledore has a phenotype that is quite

275
00:10:15,389 --> 00:10:18,360
stretchy and it kind of moves around a

276
00:10:16,948 --> 00:10:20,819
lot and it's a little bit branchy but it

277
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:22,740
works beautifully for his vertical grow

278
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:24,300
and his trellis style system so

279
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,769
different phenotypes will work

280
00:10:24,299 --> 00:10:28,169
beautifully in different environments

281
00:10:25,769 --> 00:10:30,179
but be prepared because some of them

282
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:31,828
will get stretchy and they will get a

283
00:10:30,179 --> 00:10:34,828
little branchy and when you put them

284
00:10:31,828 --> 00:10:37,439
into flower they really will stretch the

285
00:10:34,828 --> 00:10:40,019
21-day stretch is crazy on this plant

286
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,910
but you can mitigate that by doing

287
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:43,379
popping and twisting I like to pop and

288
00:10:41,909 --> 00:10:45,088
twist the branches and crunch them up

289
00:10:43,379 --> 00:10:46,740
during the first three weeks a flower

290
00:10:45,089 --> 00:10:49,410
that really slows down that lateral

291
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:51,180
growth and it will not put any harm to

292
00:10:49,409 --> 00:10:52,919
your flowers we're not building flowers

293
00:10:51,179 --> 00:10:54,989
at this time the plant is just kicking

294
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:57,509
into flower mode go ahead crunch pop

295
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:58,769
twist bend work all those stems give it

296
00:10:57,509 --> 00:11:00,720
all those knuckles make it nice and

297
00:10:58,769 --> 00:11:02,850
tough but keep it nice and low so that

298
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,800
it doesn't grow too tall too quickly

299
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:07,139
because it does want to take off on you

300
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:08,189
now I know I say this about almost every

301
00:11:07,139 --> 00:11:10,500
strain that I put out

302
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:12,330
you're going to need some sort of

303
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:14,460
supports you're gonna need to lift the

304
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:16,500
plant up also it's going to get giant

305
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:18,810
butts everything that comes from Solomon

306
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:20,970
makes pretty large butts this Durbin

307
00:11:18,809 --> 00:11:22,769
poison plant made fairly large buds from

308
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:25,410
the beginning so you are going to see

309
00:11:22,769 --> 00:11:27,659
potentially gigantic buds be prepared

310
00:11:25,409 --> 00:11:30,089
have some sticks have an extra trellis

311
00:11:27,659 --> 00:11:31,679
net have some way to support those giant

312
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:33,120
buds you don't want to walk in there on

313
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:34,949
a week five and find out that one of

314
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:38,429
those big-ass branches snapped because

315
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:40,470
your colas we're so damn big now these

316
00:11:38,429 --> 00:11:42,689
plants are going to grow quickly in veg

317
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:45,450
they will grow very quickly in flower I

318
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:48,930
have noticed that these plants like a

319
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:50,730
little bit less water than most plants

320
00:11:48,929 --> 00:11:53,729
I've noticed that if I water one gallon

321
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:55,769
every day on all of my other plants that

322
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:58,200
the double dragon plants can probably

323
00:11:55,769 --> 00:12:00,600
take half to three-quarters of a gallon

324
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:02,520
this will be phenotype specific this

325
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:04,409
will be environment specific don't just

326
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:06,929
give your plants less water because I

327
00:12:04,409 --> 00:12:08,969
said it may work pay attention you may

328
00:12:06,929 --> 00:12:11,549
notice that some of your double dragon

329
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:14,910
plants don't drink as much and as often

330
00:12:11,549 --> 00:12:17,370
as many of your other plants also they

331
00:12:14,909 --> 00:12:20,549
tend to like a little bit of a higher

332
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:22,289
temperature and a drier environment I

333
00:12:20,549 --> 00:12:24,479
think that that is coming from the

334
00:12:22,289 --> 00:12:26,969
Durban poison it comes from an African

335
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,310
region where it is hot and dry so it

336
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:31,320
makes sense they also probably have less

337
00:12:29,309 --> 00:12:33,929
water in the region where this plant

338
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:37,140
originates so the plant wants less water

339
00:12:33,929 --> 00:12:39,719
a warmer and drier environment I have

340
00:12:37,139 --> 00:12:42,090
also noticed that some phenotypes of the

341
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:45,690
Double Dragon will tolerate and possibly

342
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:47,910
enjoy a higher pH than some of the other

343
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:49,650
plants in the garden so if you are

344
00:12:47,909 --> 00:12:50,969
noticing issues with these plants and

345
00:12:49,649 --> 00:12:53,490
you think they're not up taking their

346
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:56,190
food properly you may need to increase

347
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:58,259
the pH of your feeding solution and that

348
00:12:56,190 --> 00:13:00,630
may help with your double dragon plants

349
00:12:58,259 --> 00:13:02,730
now I should mention that double dragon

350
00:13:00,629 --> 00:13:04,500
is kind of a picky plant some of the

351
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:07,500
phenotypes can be a little bit finicky

352
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:09,570
the thinner leaved phenotypes are the

353
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:11,549
more problematic plants is what I have

354
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:13,260
noticed they are harder to diagnose when

355
00:13:11,549 --> 00:13:15,899
they do [ __ ] up and they are more prone

356
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:17,159
to having problems I don't know if that

357
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:19,620
comes from the golden goat because

358
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:21,269
golden goat is always macro deficient I

359
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:22,950
don't know if that comes from the Durban

360
00:13:21,269 --> 00:13:24,389
poison I don't know if it's just those

361
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:25,740
two genetics going hey we're from

362
00:13:24,389 --> 00:13:26,460
completely different parts of the

363
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,779
[ __ ] world

364
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:29,580
you're trying to make us happy in a

365
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:32,159
commercial cultivation environment we're

366
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:33,990
not sure what to do so it could be from

367
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:35,159
the golden goat always being macro

368
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:36,690
deficient you guys if you're growing

369
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:38,189
golden goat if you're drawing golden

370
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:40,170
goat crosses if you're drawing arise

371
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:42,360
crosses there's a good likelihood that

372
00:13:40,169 --> 00:13:44,549
you're going to find macro nutrient

373
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:46,589
deficiencies early and flower and that

374
00:13:44,549 --> 00:13:48,299
bee that is probably coming from the

375
00:13:46,589 --> 00:13:50,339
hyper vigor of these plants they're just

376
00:13:48,299 --> 00:13:52,740
using all of the nutrients so they need

377
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:54,450
a little bit more but I should mention

378
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:56,370
that some of the phenotypes that come

379
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:58,500
from double dragon can be a real pain in

380
00:13:56,370 --> 00:14:00,360
the ass this is not a plant that I would

381
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:02,100
recommend for beginning growers this is

382
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:04,110
more for an advanced grower this is a

383
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:07,440
longer flowering plant we're gonna have

384
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:09,990
nine to ten maybe even eleven week

385
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,330
finishing phenotypes most phenotypes are

386
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:14,700
gonna finish around week nine some will

387
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:15,959
finish around week ten you are going to

388
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:18,420
have longer

389
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:20,458
finishing phenotypes don't discredit

390
00:14:18,419 --> 00:14:23,279
that I mean it there will be outliers

391
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:25,349
that take 11 weeks and again those

392
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:27,240
longer flowering plants those skinnier

393
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:29,430
leaf plants those taller thinner plants

394
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:31,529
they have that crazy buzz they will get

395
00:14:29,429 --> 00:14:33,389
you psychedelic trip and high but also

396
00:14:31,529 --> 00:14:35,730
they're kind of a pain in the ass to

397
00:14:33,389 --> 00:14:37,949
grow so I recommend those phenotypes for

398
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:39,659
a more experienced grower if you get a

399
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:41,730
pack of Double Dragon and you're not a

400
00:14:39,659 --> 00:14:43,799
Gro pro and you do find a couple of

401
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:46,560
phenotypes maybe stick with the one that

402
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:48,179
grows easier for you maybe don't torture

403
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:50,069
yourself and set yourself up for a

404
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:52,139
struggle by picking that super sativa

405
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:53,790
heavy phenotype and trying to fight that

406
00:14:52,139 --> 00:14:55,649
the entire time maybe pick one that is

407
00:14:53,789 --> 00:14:57,870
easier to grow because it will still

408
00:14:55,649 --> 00:15:00,120
give you a killer killer buzz and they

409
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:01,440
will all have that amazing flavor that

410
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:04,110
feels like a good way to segue into

411
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,580
talking about the flavors of most of the

412
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:08,060
phenotypes then we'll talk about the

413
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:10,530
buzz and also more specific phenotypes

414
00:15:08,059 --> 00:15:13,199
what I have found is that most of the

415
00:15:10,529 --> 00:15:15,600
phenotypes carry that sweet anise

416
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:17,759
licorice kind of a minty sort of a

417
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,279
flavor most of the phenotypes will have

418
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:23,039
that to them many of the phenotypes will

419
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:24,838
also have a sweet tropical sort of a

420
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:26,610
thing happening that comes from the

421
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:29,370
golden goat so it's a really good blend

422
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:31,949
of the golden go flavors and also the

423
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:33,659
Durban poison flavors then also on the

424
00:15:31,948 --> 00:15:35,519
exhale there's this

425
00:15:33,659 --> 00:15:38,699
int of og cush that comes with it they

426
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:40,139
leave sort of a piney mint sweet funky

427
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:41,490
tropical flavor on your mouth that

428
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:43,199
sounds like a lot of flavors but when

429
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:45,149
you smoke it you'll go up there it is

430
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:47,220
because you get the flavor on the end

431
00:15:45,149 --> 00:15:48,629
you get the flavor as you hold it then

432
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:50,460
you get another flavor as you exhale

433
00:15:48,629 --> 00:15:51,960
then if you're patient and you let the

434
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:54,090
air move around in your mouth you get an

435
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:56,250
altogether different flavor that's how I

436
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:57,930
am able to experience and enjoy all of

437
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:59,220
these terpenes and aromas and flavors

438
00:15:57,929 --> 00:16:00,779
that come from the cannabis that's how

439
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:02,879
I'm able to give you such intense

440
00:16:00,779 --> 00:16:04,769
descriptions I sit here and I taste it

441
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:06,539
like a wine connoisseur like a beer nerd

442
00:16:04,769 --> 00:16:08,699
I'm over here making funny noises and

443
00:16:06,539 --> 00:16:10,889
smacking my lips I really do my best to

444
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:12,660
get the flavors out so I notice a lot of

445
00:16:10,889 --> 00:16:14,730
the Durbin poison flavor and many

446
00:16:12,659 --> 00:16:16,889
phenotypes some of them carry that

447
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:19,920
golden goat sweetness then some of the

448
00:16:16,889 --> 00:16:23,009
phenotypes even have that funky OG Kush

449
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:25,649
then there are outliers that are very

450
00:16:23,009 --> 00:16:27,779
edgy Kush dominant in the flavor and

451
00:16:25,649 --> 00:16:29,879
aroma and it feels like the anise and

452
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:32,159
liquorice kind of got pushed right to

453
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:34,200
the very back so you just get that Kush

454
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:35,759
and then that anise and then at the end

455
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,620
there's a hint of like a mint leaf at

456
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:39,569
the very end of it so there are a lot of

457
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:42,389
good flavors that come through it the

458
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:44,100
buzz most of these phenotypes have a

459
00:16:42,389 --> 00:16:47,429
punch you in the face

460
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:49,649
[ __ ] skyrocket [ __ ] handicap you

461
00:16:47,429 --> 00:16:51,659
for the whole day kind of a buzz I can

462
00:16:49,649 --> 00:16:53,939
lose my keys when they're in my hand I

463
00:16:51,659 --> 00:16:56,069
can lose my sunglasses while I'm wearing

464
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:56,940
them I can drive past my exit on the

465
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:59,010
highway

466
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:01,620
I can do all kinds of dumb [ __ ] when I

467
00:16:59,009 --> 00:17:03,620
smoke double dragon it is a really good

468
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:06,029
kind of a time warp

469
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:08,099
psychedelic sort of a [ __ ] oh [ __ ]

470
00:17:06,029 --> 00:17:09,869
kind of a buzz and that's I've said it

471
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:12,209
before on the show that's what I love I

472
00:17:09,869 --> 00:17:14,189
love that borderline panic attack that

473
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:16,950
almost smoke myself into an anxiety

474
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:18,390
problem I really enjoy that and I think

475
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:20,670
you can tell if you walk up to me at

476
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:22,470
comedy works and I am in the zone for a

477
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:24,450
comedy show I am right on the edge of oh

478
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:25,980
[ __ ] because that's how I like to get

479
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:27,330
right before a comedy show and when the

480
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:29,670
comedy starts you settle in you just

481
00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:32,460
laugh your ass off it is beautiful I'm

482
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:35,220
talkative I'm high as [ __ ] let's talk

483
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:37,529
more specifically about the phenotypes

484
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:39,839
that we will find in a pack of Double

485
00:17:37,529 --> 00:17:43,170
Dragon of course we are going to find

486
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:45,509
the Durban poison dominant phenotype

487
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:47,370
this one makes pine cone shaped buds

488
00:17:45,509 --> 00:17:50,129
kind of spear shaped buds

489
00:17:47,369 --> 00:17:52,500
tall real sativa dominant real classic

490
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:55,110
sativa looking plants nice leaf shapes

491
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:57,119
nice structure on the plant some of them

492
00:17:55,109 --> 00:17:59,219
however may have that weird floppy side

493
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:02,159
branches [ __ ] going on but for the most

494
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:04,920
part they're gonna be tall pointy sharp

495
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:07,769
spear pine cone looking buds and most of

496
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:10,259
them are bright green the Durbin poison

497
00:18:07,769 --> 00:18:12,900
dominant phenotypes are like bright

498
00:18:10,259 --> 00:18:14,519
almost a neon green sort of a color they

499
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:16,500
don't get that dark color that the cush

500
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:18,329
is get so that is a really nice

501
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,710
noticeable difference if you've got that

502
00:18:18,329 --> 00:18:20,819
bright bright green that could be from

503
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:22,920
your nutrients it could be from your

504
00:18:20,819 --> 00:18:25,409
lights but in comparison the bright

505
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:27,720
bright green is a little more durbin

506
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:30,509
dominant then of course there is the

507
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:33,029
arize or golden goat dominant phenotype

508
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:36,058
i see more golden goat than i do any of

509
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:37,859
the OG Kush any of the joseph OG any of

510
00:18:36,058 --> 00:18:39,750
the chem d any of the Daybreaker traits

511
00:18:37,859 --> 00:18:41,879
i find more of the golden goat you're

512
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:43,679
going to get skinnier leaves here these

513
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:45,179
leaves are skinnier and they kind of

514
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:47,190
talk over a little bit right at the base

515
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:48,870
where the PDL starts to spread off into

516
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:50,549
the fingers of the leaves they look a

517
00:18:48,869 --> 00:18:52,500
little bit crinkled a little bit taco e

518
00:18:50,549 --> 00:18:55,019
that is normal that is coming from the

519
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:56,759
golden goat and also that plant is going

520
00:18:55,019 --> 00:18:58,920
to get macro deficient that one is

521
00:18:56,759 --> 00:19:01,740
telling you I'm gonna be macro deficient

522
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:03,929
it doesn't get as light green as the

523
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:06,058
Durban phenotype but it does stay a

524
00:19:03,929 --> 00:19:08,309
little bit lighter green it takes off

525
00:19:06,058 --> 00:19:10,379
growing the golden go phenotype really

526
00:19:08,308 --> 00:19:12,660
gets going it gets kind of tall then

527
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:14,280
there is the cushy phenotype which I

528
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:16,679
talked about it doesn't carry as much of

529
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:18,569
the Durban and the golden goat aromas it

530
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:20,730
stays a little bit shorter it stays a

531
00:19:18,569 --> 00:19:22,740
little bit more squat honestly it's not

532
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:25,049
the phenotype I was hoping to breed out

533
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:27,000
of this project but it's in there and it

534
00:19:25,049 --> 00:19:28,769
happens I call it the cushy phenotype

535
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,140
it's shorter its squatty

536
00:19:28,769 --> 00:19:34,289
it also could come from some of the

537
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:36,210
romulan also from the golden go cross

538
00:19:34,289 --> 00:19:38,428
but I think it's more cushy dominant

539
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:39,569
then there is one that I call the fist

540
00:19:38,429 --> 00:19:41,970
phenotype

541
00:19:39,569 --> 00:19:44,069
it makes buds that look like little

542
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:46,440
fists or block heads I've also called it

543
00:19:44,069 --> 00:19:48,779
the blockhead phenotype for some reason

544
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:50,640
it doesn't grow pointy Spears it just

545
00:19:48,779 --> 00:19:52,170
grows chunks that look like sponges

546
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,179
hanging off of the stick or a bunch of

547
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:56,370
fists hanging off of the stick

548
00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:59,670
that is a great phenotype that one has a

549
00:19:56,369 --> 00:20:01,139
really delicious Durban poison flavor a

550
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:03,210
really nice Durban

551
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:05,610
a neuroma then it brings in some of that

552
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:07,500
golden goat sweetness but the high is a

553
00:20:05,609 --> 00:20:09,779
little bit more heavier it's got a

554
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:11,670
little bit more indica to it than all of

555
00:20:09,779 --> 00:20:14,279
the other sativa dominant phenotypes

556
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:17,070
about what I call the block head or the

557
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:18,720
fist it gets really frosty that one will

558
00:20:17,069 --> 00:20:20,609
get bigger leaves you'll notice if

559
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:23,549
you've got it then there is the one that

560
00:20:20,609 --> 00:20:26,549
I call the [ __ ] weirdo that one grows

561
00:20:23,549 --> 00:20:28,559
out weird sideways vines it grows real

562
00:20:26,549 --> 00:20:30,089
tall and spindly it almost looks like

563
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:32,250
some kind of vine you would find on the

564
00:20:30,089 --> 00:20:35,970
side of the house it's really really

565
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:37,470
unique but it is so potent

566
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:39,900
I've grown that one out a couple of

567
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:42,180
times it sucks to grow it's no fun but

568
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:45,330
if you dry it and cure it and smoke it

569
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:47,250
your eyes get my eyes I can't talk about

570
00:20:45,329 --> 00:20:50,099
yours my eyes and everybody else I

571
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:52,289
smoked it with were devil red it just

572
00:20:50,099 --> 00:20:55,319
went straight to the eyes it gave me the

573
00:20:52,289 --> 00:20:58,079
most intense cottonmouth and I was so

574
00:20:55,319 --> 00:21:00,960
high that it was weird I was just like

575
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:02,579
driving been this [ __ ] high in a long

576
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,960
time you know when you're high you have

577
00:21:02,579 --> 00:21:05,609
to just like keep looking at all your

578
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:07,920
friends go bro you [ __ ] high as me

579
00:21:05,609 --> 00:21:09,269
and I'm a serious heavy smoker and this

580
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:11,370
stuff had everybody looking around the

581
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:12,509
room gone brewery I'm [ __ ] baked bro

582
00:21:11,369 --> 00:21:14,339
and people are looking at me like would

583
00:21:12,509 --> 00:21:17,309
you put in that Weed Man like it's just

584
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:20,069
good weed dude it's one phenotype also

585
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:22,559
that phenotype doesn't put out for [ __ ]

586
00:21:20,069 --> 00:21:24,869
the harvest wait on that psychedelic

587
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:26,759
crazy branchy phenotype it makes tiny

588
00:21:24,869 --> 00:21:28,409
little wispy buds they're fluffy their

589
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:31,829
Airy they suck but they're coated in

590
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:33,690
resin and Nogami so incredibly high so

591
00:21:31,829 --> 00:21:35,789
that is the weirdo phenotype it's kind

592
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:37,740
of stretchy it grows weird floppy

593
00:21:35,789 --> 00:21:40,409
branches it wants to go sideways

594
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:42,059
also if you accidentally bump one of

595
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:43,860
those branches they break right off the

596
00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:46,289
plant I don't know what that is a trait

597
00:21:43,859 --> 00:21:48,149
from it's very uh it's not a strong

598
00:21:46,289 --> 00:21:50,250
plant but that is one phenotype it

599
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:53,160
doesn't pop up very often it is the

600
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:55,319
[ __ ] weirdo it is not in the mix very

601
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:57,450
commonly I've probably seen it two out

602
00:21:55,319 --> 00:21:59,159
of a hundred seeds so don't worry you

603
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:02,250
probably won't get that phenotype

604
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:04,769
there is the Durban Fino that one is

605
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:06,809
going to take probably 9 or 10 weeks

606
00:22:04,769 --> 00:22:08,849
you've got the golden go phyno that

607
00:22:06,809 --> 00:22:10,950
one's gonna take you about 9 weeks the

608
00:22:08,849 --> 00:22:13,829
cushy phyno and the fisty phyno are

609
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:14,759
about 9 we curse that weirdo she likes

610
00:22:13,829 --> 00:22:16,978
to go 10

611
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:18,989
maybe a little bit more weeks then

612
00:22:16,979 --> 00:22:21,149
you're going to see the perfect blend

613
00:22:18,989 --> 00:22:23,699
the goal I was going for there is the

614
00:22:21,148 --> 00:22:26,278
blend of the Durban poison that crosses

615
00:22:23,699 --> 00:22:28,679
beautifully to the arize it has got a

616
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:31,558
beautiful Christmas tree like structure

617
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:33,239
it grows one giant Cola right up the

618
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:35,489
center the whole middle of the plants

619
00:22:33,239 --> 00:22:37,528
gonna be one big giant bud then you get

620
00:22:35,489 --> 00:22:39,959
a lot a nice side branching that all

621
00:22:37,528 --> 00:22:41,909
fills in real nice the only downfall is

622
00:22:39,959 --> 00:22:42,989
there is a little bit of node spacing a

623
00:22:41,909 --> 00:22:44,278
little bit of stretchiness

624
00:22:42,989 --> 00:22:47,159
but I think that that is the

625
00:22:44,278 --> 00:22:49,858
sought-after the desired phenotype it

626
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:52,319
has got all of that Durban poison flavor

627
00:22:49,858 --> 00:22:54,418
it's got all the ANA anise the liquorice

628
00:22:52,318 --> 00:22:56,699
the mint enos then it's got some of that

629
00:22:54,419 --> 00:22:58,679
golden go to it then it's got that after

630
00:22:56,699 --> 00:23:00,359
you exhale it's like why is there a

631
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:03,538
skunk in the air you don't taste the

632
00:23:00,358 --> 00:23:05,608
skunk but it smells tropical minty anise

633
00:23:03,538 --> 00:23:06,749
licorice and then skunk in the air but

634
00:23:05,608 --> 00:23:08,698
people come into the room they're like

635
00:23:06,749 --> 00:23:10,499
are you smoking skunk but you don't

636
00:23:08,699 --> 00:23:12,389
taste it it's not in the flavour when

637
00:23:10,499 --> 00:23:15,808
you inhale or exhale it just hangs in

638
00:23:12,388 --> 00:23:18,738
the room then the buzz from the 50/50

639
00:23:15,808 --> 00:23:21,269
mix is exactly what I like it's got me

640
00:23:18,739 --> 00:23:23,879
psychedelic high it's got me real

641
00:23:21,269 --> 00:23:25,739
slant-eyed real squinty eyed it's got me

642
00:23:23,878 --> 00:23:27,358
walking kind of slow and slowing down at

643
00:23:25,739 --> 00:23:29,818
green lights and [ __ ] waiting for

644
00:23:27,358 --> 00:23:32,249
stop signs to turn green and [ __ ] but it

645
00:23:29,818 --> 00:23:33,928
keeps me nice and social and it puts a

646
00:23:32,249 --> 00:23:35,429
silly grin on my face you ever get

647
00:23:33,929 --> 00:23:37,229
stoned and you just you can't help it

648
00:23:35,429 --> 00:23:38,909
but you just make that stupid grin and

649
00:23:37,229 --> 00:23:40,588
somebody eats you for it cuz you got

650
00:23:38,909 --> 00:23:42,239
that stupid grin but who cares good as

651
00:23:40,588 --> 00:23:45,208
it just feels good it gives me that

652
00:23:42,239 --> 00:23:47,519
silly [ __ ] stupid grin and I enjoy it

653
00:23:45,209 --> 00:23:49,589
so you guys I think those are the

654
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:51,868
phenotypes that you are going to find in

655
00:23:49,588 --> 00:23:53,788
the Double Dragon I really enjoy growing

656
00:23:51,868 --> 00:23:56,638
double dragon I really love smoking

657

double dragon it makes crazy crazy good

658
00:23:56,638 --> 00:24:00,718
concentrates most of the phenotypes are

659
00:23:59,068 --> 00:24:03,269
going to finish around nine or ten weeks

660
00:24:00,719 --> 00:24:05,519
some phenotypes may go up to 11 weeks

661
00:24:03,269 --> 00:24:07,769
but they are super potent I find it to

662
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:09,598
be worth it most of the phenotypes will

663
00:24:07,769 --> 00:24:11,788
give you pretty fat yields nice heavy

664
00:24:09,598 --> 00:24:13,769
harvests most of them are super potent

665
00:24:11,788 --> 00:24:17,128
and all of them are going to taste

666
00:24:13,769 --> 00:24:19,469
