00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:15,000
irygenetics.com there's a tab on the top

28
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:16,859
right that says questions if you click

29

you growing where are you growing it is

32

it indoors Outdoors how are your temps

33
00:01:22,379 --> 00:01:25,679
and humidity would you feed the plants

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,959

38
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,159
from our friend Brad in Canada big shout

39
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:37,199

listened to every episode that's

46
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:51,478
available on Spotify and it has quickly

47
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:53,219
become my favorite growing podcast I do

48
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:55,259
appreciate that you are listening on

49
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:57,539
Spotify but I do highly recommend that

50
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:59,280
you check out the YouTube videos every

51
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:01,500
single episode is available on YouTube

52
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,879
well let me say that over because not

53
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,280
every single episode is on YouTube

54
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:07,199
YouTube has taken some down but there

55
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,179
are a lot more episodes available on

56
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,659
YouTube than there are Spotify there's

57
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:14,400
probably 785 episodes on YouTube uh

58
00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:16,799
Spotify only gives us the most 100

59
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,140
recent I believe so there's a lot more

60
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,959
content on YouTube also come check out

61

favorite growing podcast your deep Dives

68
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:36,780
and out of the box creative thinking

69
00:02:34,259 --> 00:02:38,459
such as 18 6 for the last 10 days of

70
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:40,439
flowering uh so thank you thank you for

71
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:42,900
noticing that I do appreciate that it

72
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:45,479
says or 18 6 for bigger stronger faster

73
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:47,400
finishing seeds is truly One of a Kind

74
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:49,619
information you can only learn here I

75
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,760
appreciate you dude those are great

76
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:53,219
compliments and I get a lot of

77
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:55,139
controversy a lot of uh feedback a lot

78
00:02:53,219 --> 00:02:56,639
of uh a lot of flack I guess for

79
00:02:55,139 --> 00:02:58,318
teaching people to run their plants on

80
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:59,639
18-6 at the end of flower a lot of

81
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:01,560
people say I'm crazy a lot of people

82
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:03,539
have sent negative feedback but guess

83
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,860
what the only people that tell me I'm a

84
00:03:03,539 --> 00:03:06,780
lunatic the only people that tell me

85
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:08,400
it's a bad idea are people who haven't

86
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:10,979
tried it people that try to run their

87
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,900
plants 18 6 for the last 10 to 14 days

88
00:03:10,979 --> 00:03:14,459
of the flowering phase they always come

89
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,959
back and they say dude my plants were

90
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:17,340
better they were beefier they were

91
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:18,959
chunkier there was more to it and they

92
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:21,000
finished a little bit bit sooner people

93
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,519
to make seeds under the 18-6 schedule at

94
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,259
the end they always tell me they have

95
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,420
great success with the seed so thank you

96
00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:28,979
for noticing the 18 6 idea thank you for

97
00:03:27,419 --> 00:03:31,738
trying that I'm glad that worked out for

98
00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:34,318
you it goes on it says anyhow on today's

99
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:36,658
podcast you mentioned watching out for

100
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:39,119
expired fertilizers and how they can

101
00:03:36,658 --> 00:03:40,919
negatively affect your grow I was hoping

102
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,200
you could go over how to properly

103
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:45,539
dispose of your gross waste products

104
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:48,179
such as bottles of fertilizer runoff

105
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:50,759
pesticides Etc thanks again for all you

106
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:52,799
do Brad from Canada this is a very great

107
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:54,359
question this is a very important

108
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,879
question this is something that I feel

109
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:59,099
is very overlooked in the commercial and

110
00:03:56,878 --> 00:04:00,719
private production of cannabis I am

111
00:03:59,098 --> 00:04:02,878
trained by the Colorado Department of

112
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:05,098
Agriculture to understand pesticide

113
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:06,959
handling pesticide application I

114
00:04:05,098 --> 00:04:08,579
understand mixing nutrients safely I

115
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,979
understand applying nutrients safely

116
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:12,659
however in the state of Colorado for the

117
00:04:10,979 --> 00:04:15,060
marijuana enforcement Division and the

118
00:04:12,658 --> 00:04:16,319
Colorado Department of Agriculture and

119
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,280
public health and environment which are

120
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:20,040
two different entities I kind of

121
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:23,339
combined them but there is technically

122
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:26,280
no protocol for disposing of Wastewater

123
00:04:23,339 --> 00:04:28,619
excess nutrients excess pesticides

124
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:31,439
there's no true protocol for that in a

125
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:33,959
commercial cultivation facility my main

126
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:36,000
concern is the pesticides I really

127
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:38,519
really try when we are creating a batch

128
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,379
of pesticides to apply I try not to make

129
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:42,299
too much I'd rather have almost too

130
00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:44,159
little or just barely enough to coat the

131
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,960
room to get the job done so I don't have

132
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,699
to figure out what to do with the

133
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:49,620
leftover pesticides honestly we just

134
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:51,240
spray just keep spraying until you run

135
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:52,860
out because that's that's your best

136
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,240
option apply it to the plants apply it

137
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:56,340
to the walls if you need to hit the

138
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,139
floor I try not to waste it by pouring

139
00:04:56,339 --> 00:05:01,859
it into the water supply or into the

140
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:03,660
ground so pesticides my main mission is

141
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:06,000
to just mix up just enough and coat the

142
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:07,680
rooms after several applications I've

143
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,839
been applying in several locations for

144
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,459
so long that basically we know exactly

145
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:13,019
how much to mix up per room for that

146
00:05:11,459 --> 00:05:14,579
room I need seven gallons for that room

147
00:05:13,019 --> 00:05:16,319
I'm just pointing at arbitrary rooms

148
00:05:14,579 --> 00:05:17,879
that exist in my head I know that that

149
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:19,259
one room takes about seven gallons that

150
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:21,478
other room only needs about three and a

151
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:23,220
half gallons so most of my method there

152
00:05:21,478 --> 00:05:24,959
is strategy and not mixing up too much

153
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:27,180
to where I have any waste or leftovers

154
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:28,680
which uh sometimes I nail it honestly

155
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:30,600
sometimes we don't and then we do have

156
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,220
to get creative with the disposal of

157
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,919
those nutrients the department of AG has

158
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:36,720
taught us that uh dilution is the

159
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:38,879
solution to pollution so if you've got

160
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,740
to pour it somewhere mix it heavily with

161
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:42,060
regular water and dispose of it that

162
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:44,460
does not sound like the greatest idea

163
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:46,680
but that's what I was instructed by the

164
00:05:44,459 --> 00:05:48,418
department of AG was to pour it down the

165
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,400
floor drain and dilute it with regular

166
00:05:48,418 --> 00:05:52,918
water now let's talk more about the

167
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:54,899
nutrients waste nutrients in a

168
00:05:52,918 --> 00:05:57,418
commercial grow it would not be uncommon

169
00:05:54,899 --> 00:05:59,099
for me to mix up a 500 gallon reservoir

170
00:05:57,418 --> 00:06:01,439
of nutrients and then feed most of that

171
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:03,300
to the plants then there is runoff in

172
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:05,839
most most cases you hear me preach about

173
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:08,759
watering to run off fortunately

174
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:10,439
unfortunately once again there is not a

175
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:11,759
protocol with the Colorado Department of

176
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:14,699
Agriculture the Department of Health

177
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,620
OSHA nobody's given us a true uh

178
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:18,840
standard operating procedure of how to

179
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:20,519
dispose of the leftover nutrients

180
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:22,739
luckily I was going to say say

181
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:24,538
fortunately so fortunately at one of the

182
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:26,579
facilities where I spent most of my time

183
00:06:24,538 --> 00:06:28,199
the facility was out in what would be

184
00:06:26,579 --> 00:06:30,120
considered a big field in the middle of

185
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:31,740
a desert area so there's just a bunch of

186
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,899
brush out there a bunch of Sagebrush a

187
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:35,819
bunch of cactus bunch of Yucca a bunch

188
00:06:33,899 --> 00:06:37,620
of dirt and that's what was behind our

189
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:39,360
facility so most of the time if we had

190
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:41,220
excess water we would pour that water

191
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,020
into the dirt and water those plants

192
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:45,539
which was amazing because all of the

193
00:06:43,019 --> 00:06:47,579
vegetation behind our facility was Lush

194
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:49,079
and gigantic year round everywhere else

195
00:06:47,579 --> 00:06:51,659
it would turn brown it would get Dusty

196
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:53,579
and crunchy our vegetation behind our

197
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:55,860
facility around our facility was

198
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:57,180
beautiful it was huge also we got some

199
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:59,340
giant rabbits and some giant

200
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:00,660
rattlesnakes and a bunch of giant life

201
00:06:59,339 --> 00:07:01,978
because I think we were feeding the

202
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:03,840
plants so well there was a lot of food

203
00:07:01,978 --> 00:07:05,099
food was abundant the animals were

204
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:07,258
abundant which made the rattlesnakes

205
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:08,699
abundant which made the birds abundant

206
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:10,259
there was a lot of [ __ ] happening in our

207
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:11,759
area and I think a lot of it was because

208
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:13,680
of the nutrients which we were dumping

209
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:15,120
out there in that field and feeding all

210
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,160
of those weeds all those plants we're

211
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,720
giving them high quality grow nutrients

212
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:21,000
and boosting the [ __ ] out of them so

213
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,580
that was how we were disposing of the

214
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,899
excess water the nutrients the nutrients

215
00:07:23,579 --> 00:07:26,879
unfortunately we were told that that

216
00:07:24,899 --> 00:07:28,560
should go down the floor drain I did not

217
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:30,598
agree with that but I did not know what

218
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,879
else to do so unfortunately there was

219
00:07:30,598 --> 00:07:34,800
not a strong protocol by any of the

220
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:36,538
governing bodies that kind of oversee

221
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,800
the production of cannabis so we were

222
00:07:36,538 --> 00:07:39,659
basically told that the standard

223
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,160
operating procedure and the thing to do

224
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:43,020
would be to pour it down the floor drain

225
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:45,060
or to continue putting it in the

226
00:07:43,019 --> 00:07:46,859
backyard like I was doing it never felt

227
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:48,478
good putting a pesticide in a floor

228
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:49,919
drain but that's what we were instructed

229
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:51,598
to do and sometimes I did not have any

230
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:53,159
other options so just pour it down the

231
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:54,719
floor drain and pour a bunch of gallons

232
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,520
of water on top of it that way we kind

233
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,900
of dilute that a little bit I wish there

234
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:59,339
was a better answer to this honestly

235
00:07:57,899 --> 00:08:01,500
because it doesn't feel good telling you

236
00:07:59,339 --> 00:08:03,359
that the protocol was to portion in the

237
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:05,519
backyard and pour it down a drain but in

238
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,960
Colorado there is no rule we were never

239
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:08,219
fined we were never told to do any

240
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:09,959
differently we were never given any

241
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:11,340
guidance and when I said that's what we

242
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:12,659
were doing the department of AG

243
00:08:11,339 --> 00:08:14,459
basically turned their head and said I

244
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,720
guess that's what you got to do so I

245
00:08:14,459 --> 00:08:18,180
agree with you that's not the best way

246
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:19,979
to do it but that's the option that I

247
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:22,500
was given so that's basically how we got

248
00:08:19,978 --> 00:08:24,060
rid of the runoff fertilizers and the

249
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,819
pesticides you did ask about a couple of

250
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:28,800
other products bottles of fertilizer we

251
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:30,240
would basically use the fertilizer in a

252
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,680
commercial grow we would use that to the

253
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,000
end there would never be anything left

254
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,099
nothing would expire in a commercial

255
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,200
grow that stuff comes and goes very

256
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:39,599
quickly if you're disposing of a

257
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,219
pesticide or a nutrient bottle the

258
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,899
proper protocol is to poke a bunch of

259
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:44,700
holes in that bottle near the bottom

260
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:46,799
around the sides so that nobody can

261
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:48,660
reuse that container and get themselves

262
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:50,819
sick a pesticide bottle a nutrient

263
00:08:48,659 --> 00:08:51,719
bottle it's got to be punctured several

264
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,580
times

265
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,500
and then those punctured bottles would

266
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:57,839
go into a dumpster that had to be locked

267
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,639
also into that dumpster would go all of

268
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,860
our root balls a lot of our organic

269
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:03,360
waste a lot of the sticks the stems a

270
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:05,159
lot of the trim that we didn't use to

271
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:08,159
send out to get extracted any waste

272
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:10,259
would go into a big dumpster uh old pots

273
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:11,759
old soil just about all of the waste

274
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:14,220
would get put into one dumpster that was

275
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:16,379
required to be locked and only uh the

276
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:18,120
facility manager which was myself most

277
00:09:16,379 --> 00:09:20,159
of the time and the person that picked

278
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,959
up the trash had a key to that dumpster

279
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:24,179
you would not believe how many times

280
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:25,439
people cut the lock off of our dumpster

281
00:09:24,179 --> 00:09:27,599
tried to break into our dumpster

282
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,860
destroyed our dumpster to get what they

283
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,500
thought was product but it was actually

284
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:33,480
nothing but sticks and dirt and waste

285
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:35,519
when you throw something away if there

286
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,500
is plant material in your waist and you

287
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,060
throw that away in Colorado it's got to

288
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,980
be destroyed it's either got to be mixed

289
00:09:39,059 --> 00:09:42,958
with bleach or they like it if you mix

290
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:45,000
it with kitty litter a lot of the times

291
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:46,679
what I would do is I when we harvested I

292
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,539
would save a couple of pots behind three

293
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:50,458
gallon pots filled with cocoa so that

294
00:09:48,539 --> 00:09:51,659
way when it came time to blend in the

295
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:53,759
waste from all the plants I could dump

296
00:09:51,659 --> 00:09:55,439
some of that cocoa on top of it put some

297
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:57,000
plants in there dump cocoa on top of it

298
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,100
put plants in there basically they

299
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,958
wanted you to make a lasagna of plant

300
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:02,639
waste and then something to destroy the

301
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:03,838
plant waste and then more waste so that

302
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:05,278
when the people do come in and break

303
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,600
into the trash cans if they do get

304
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:08,399
something they don't really get a

305
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:11,040
product they can make any profit or any

306
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,958
consumption off of they were trying they

307
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:14,399
were trying but some of the med rules

308
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:16,500
were completely ridiculous since I'm

309
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,700
thinking about it I've got footage I

310
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,860
probably don't have the footage on my

311
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:21,480
phone anymore I work for a facility it

312
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:22,680
was kind of tucked back off of the Main

313
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,180
Street

314
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:26,039
um any traffic that went by there was

315
00:10:24,179 --> 00:10:27,778
just weirdo traffic looking for problems

316
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:29,039
a lot of people would come by on bikes

317
00:10:27,778 --> 00:10:30,720
and shine flashlights in our grow

318
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:32,579
facility we had to build a 12-foot fence

319
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,620
around the facility and keep the trash

320
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:36,120
can inside the 12-foot fence and still

321
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:38,700
lock the trash cans because people are

322
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:40,560
crazy anyway one night a homeless person

323
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:42,120
climbed over I assumed they were

324
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:45,059
homeless I'd seen them around there I'd

325
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:46,919
never they they looked very maybe I'm

326
00:10:45,059 --> 00:10:48,299
prejudging but this person that did not

327
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:50,099
look like they'd had a shower on a while

328
00:10:48,299 --> 00:10:51,599
that part was quite obvious they climbed

329
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:53,519
our fence they tried to get into the

330
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,139
trash can they couldn't get into it so

331
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,459
they shimmied up one of the rain gutters

332
00:10:55,139 --> 00:10:59,220
and got to the roof of the building

333
00:10:56,458 --> 00:11:01,139
jumped off the roof WWF style and

334
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:02,879
shoulder bombed their way through the

335
00:11:01,139 --> 00:11:05,220
top of our dumpster the metal lid of the

336
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:06,958
dumpster caved in a bunch of dust came

337
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:08,519
flying up you saw them fall through it

338
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:09,778
they looked disheveled for a couple of

339
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:11,700
seconds they got their [ __ ] together

340
00:11:09,778 --> 00:11:13,320
they looked like they just won the

341
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,700
freaking Lottery but then when they

342
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,200
threw those bags over the fence they

343
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:18,060
left them there because they realized it

344
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,980
wasn't nothing but sticks and [ __ ]

345
00:11:18,059 --> 00:11:21,659
kitty litter so this person climbed up

346
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:25,139
our rain gutter got all the way to the

347
00:11:21,659 --> 00:11:27,240
roof of the building and WWE or WWF

348
00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:29,819
style jumped off the [ __ ] building

349
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:31,919
through our dumpster to attempt to steal

350
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:33,420
our trash that's how ridiculous it was

351
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:35,759
so everything that went into that

352
00:11:33,419 --> 00:11:37,979
dumpster had to be destroyed punctured

353
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:39,659
uh mixed with kitty litter ground to a

354
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:41,759
pulp and then the dumpster had to be

355
00:11:39,659 --> 00:11:44,219
locked it was behind two gates in some

356
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:46,078
facilities the trash was a very uh it

357
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:48,540
was a huge Target I've never had my

358
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:50,039
trash targeted like that before so let

359
00:11:48,539 --> 00:11:52,379
me recap and make sure I've answered all

360
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:54,299
of the aspects of this question dispose

361
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:55,740
of the grow waste products uh I

362
00:11:54,299 --> 00:11:58,139
considered grow waste products to be

363
00:11:55,740 --> 00:12:00,539
plants pots stuff like that that goes

364
00:11:58,139 --> 00:12:02,639
into the locked dumpster uh bottles of

365
00:12:00,539 --> 00:12:04,139
fertilizer we use all of the liquid

366
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,639
inside of those bottles

367
00:12:04,139 --> 00:12:07,740
everything gets used in a commercial

368
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:09,899
facility when you're mixing up 500

369
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:11,639
gallons of nutrients if you've just got

370
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:12,839
a little bit extra just pour it in it'll

371
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:14,159
be fine it won't make a difference for

372
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:16,200
one feeding if it's a little bit guys

373
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:18,600
don't go get crazy but so the bottles

374
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:21,060
get punctured run off again we did not

375
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,620
have any guidance or expertise on what

376
00:12:21,059 --> 00:12:24,179
to do with the runoff I was pouring it

377
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:27,000
in the field and feeding the vegetation

378
00:12:24,179 --> 00:12:29,278
the pesticides we do our best our

379
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,320
absolute best to mix up enough for this

380
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:33,120
application so that none is wasted and

381
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:34,860
then if you need to over spray go spray

382
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,778
some foliage outside something like that

383
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:38,278
if you really have to so I think that

384
00:12:36,778 --> 00:12:39,720
wraps up that question I do want to send

385
00:12:38,278 --> 00:12:41,879
another big thank you shout out to our

00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:21,179
I've said before that if I read your

406
00:13:19,078 --> 00:13:23,399
question here on the podcast you will

407
00:13:21,179 --> 00:13:24,719
win a free pack of seeds all right let's

408
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:26,759
keep moving I've got another great

409
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,500
question in front of me this one came

410
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:30,600
from our friend Daniel big shout out to

411
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:33,299
Daniel it says what kind of grow

412
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:35,759
question do you have and Daniel said how

413
00:13:33,299 --> 00:13:38,338
viable is a breeding project that is

414
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:40,439
solely based on using pollen from

415
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:42,060
reversed females that's a really good

416
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:43,980
question it says I want to get into

417
00:13:42,059 --> 00:13:46,439
breeding but my current circumstances

418
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:49,620
greatly favor growing fam autoflowers

419
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:51,480
over photos I'm assuming I'm able to

420
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:53,759
readily reverse them are there

421
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:56,120
significant downsides compared to using

422
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:58,139
males this is a really good question

423
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:00,600
some of the info that I'm going to give

424
00:13:58,139 --> 00:14:02,879
you this next piece of info comes from

425
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,740
my friend Mr Soul big shout out to Mr

426
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:07,320
Soul at Brothers Grim seed company go

427
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:10,560
support him really good dude uh very

428
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:11,940
very smart guy we I agree with 99 of

429
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:13,859
what he says when it comes to talking

430
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:16,079
about cannabis and almost anything else

431
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:18,480
which is very rare for me to agree with

432
00:14:16,078 --> 00:14:21,359
somebody that much 99 is huge agreement

433
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,399
so big fist bump to my buddy Mr Soul Mr

434
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:26,220
Soul put it this way one time

435
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:28,620
the only difference between regular and

436
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:31,139
feminized seeds the main difference the

437
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:33,899
difference is the pollen the female

438
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:36,899
pollen is what is creating female seeds

439
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:39,000
on your plant basically imagine this is

440
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:41,100
not how it works but you can imagine it

441
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,198
this way imagine if I were able to

442
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:46,139
create a filter and put a filter in the

443
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:48,240
air and that filter only removed male

444
00:14:46,139 --> 00:14:49,799
pollen from the air it knew it was like

445
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,539
female pollen you can go ahead and party

446
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:53,578
you could get through uh it's ladies

447
00:14:51,539 --> 00:14:55,679
night but male pollen no way bro you're

448
00:14:53,578 --> 00:14:57,599
staying outside so imagine I've got this

449
00:14:55,679 --> 00:15:00,059
filter and then I make my plant produce

450
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:02,699
pollen all we are doing is eliminating

451
00:15:00,059 --> 00:15:04,379
the male pollen from the equation and

452
00:15:02,698 --> 00:15:07,919
that female pollen is hitting the plants

453
00:15:04,379 --> 00:15:09,899
and making 100 female seeds my friend Mr

454
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:12,179
Soul put it that way he gave me the

455
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:13,860
analogy of using the filter that is very

456
00:15:12,179 --> 00:15:16,078
much what it's like when breeding with a

457
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:17,459
reversed female the only difference that

458
00:15:16,078 --> 00:15:18,958
you're going okay there may be another

459
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:20,159
difference I'll get into but the only

460
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:21,838
difference that you're going to notice

461
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:24,899
is that it's going to be all female

462
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:26,459
seeds because there is no male pollen in

463
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:28,440
the mix that's where we are reversing

464
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:30,719
the female plant because we're making

465
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:32,760
female pollen that's where the magic

466
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,800
happens the female pollen is the key to

467
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:36,480
all that feminization so it's all female

468
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:38,278
pollen I said there's one more thing you

469
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:42,120
may notice the thing you're going to

470
00:15:38,278 --> 00:15:45,419
notice is more uniform phenotypes and

471
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:47,399
less transgressive segregation a lot of

472
00:15:45,419 --> 00:15:49,379
times when we work with regular seeds

473
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:51,480
when we make further filial Generations

474
00:15:49,379 --> 00:15:53,578
we will see expressions of the

475
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:55,019
grandparents and the the grandma and the

476
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:57,239
grandpa and the great grandma and the

477
00:15:55,019 --> 00:15:58,860
great grandpa on both sides so you've

478
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:00,600
got the options of more things popping

479
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:02,879
up in your mix if you're using the

480
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,500
regular seeds using Femme seeds I think

481
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:06,659
we kind of cut some of that out we get

482
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:08,820
less phenotypical phenotypical

483
00:16:06,659 --> 00:16:11,219
expression less variation and more

484
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:13,199
uniformity in my experience with the

485
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,579
plants that I have selected if you

486
00:16:13,198 --> 00:16:16,679
select different plants and go a

487
00:16:14,578 --> 00:16:18,419
different route and you're breeding that

488
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:20,278
could vary just because of the plants

489
00:16:18,419 --> 00:16:22,620
that were chosen I feel like over time

490
00:16:20,278 --> 00:16:24,360
I've developed a very Discerning Eye a

491
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:26,639
very keen eye for selecting breeding

492
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:28,740
Pairs and this far in my breeding game I

493
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,180
really do see very nice phenotypes

494
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:32,220
coming from the Femmes and less

495
00:16:30,179 --> 00:16:33,958
variation than what I see coming from

496
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:36,060
the regular seeds I make plenty of both

497
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:38,399
I make a lot of feminized seeds and I

498
00:16:36,059 --> 00:16:40,258
make a lot of regular seeds I grow a lot

499
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,778
of them out my test team grows a lot of

500
00:16:40,259 --> 00:16:44,940
them out my testing is 100 transparent

501
00:16:42,778 --> 00:16:46,679
we do it on Discord everybody can see it

502
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:49,259
then a lot of people grow out the seeds

503
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:52,198
that make it to Market I'm seeing less

504
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:53,699
variation in the feminized seeds than I

505
00:16:52,198 --> 00:16:55,979
am in the regular seeds so that's

506
00:16:53,698 --> 00:16:57,240
possibly an advantage I like the

507
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:58,680
variation that is coming from the

508
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,899
regular seeds that's why I like doing

509
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:03,179
rag seeds I like seeing how the male

510
00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:04,798
expresses how the female expresses what

511
00:17:03,179 --> 00:17:06,838
the difference is if I take this male

512
00:17:04,798 --> 00:17:09,240
and pollinate four different females how

513
00:17:06,838 --> 00:17:10,678
does that Express differently it will be

514
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:12,419
clear what that reversed plant is

515
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:14,640
contributing to your breeding project if

516
00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:16,079
you pollinate multiple females with that

517
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,520
plant and see what the differences are

518
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:19,019
you'll be able to see oh when I

519
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:20,818
pollinated the strawberry plant with

520
00:17:19,019 --> 00:17:22,740
this blueberry plant we got strawberry

521
00:17:20,818 --> 00:17:24,539
blueberry but when I pollinated the

522
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:26,039
orange plant with the blueberry the

523
00:17:24,539 --> 00:17:27,418
orange really dominated but if I

524
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:28,859
pollinated Durbin poison with the

525
00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:31,020
blueberry the Durbin poison really

526
00:17:28,859 --> 00:17:32,639
dominated you'll get to see what traits

527
00:17:31,019 --> 00:17:34,679
and what dominates and what mix by

528
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:37,679
breeding to other plants but you won't

529
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:39,480
see as much variation as you would if

530
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:41,700
you were running the regular seeds in my

531
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:43,919
experience in that in that test right

532
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:46,019
there I do see more variation I see more

533
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:47,940
grandparents represented with the

534
00:17:46,019 --> 00:17:49,079
regular seeds so let me recap the

535
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,700
question make sure I'm giving you a

536
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:52,678
solid answer

537
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:54,960
um how viable is breeding that solely

538
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:57,720
uses pollen from reversed females uh

539
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:00,600
lemon Jeffrey is one of my most popular

540
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:02,819
best-selling strains orangegasm is

541
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:04,678
definitely orange Chasm is my number one

542
00:18:02,819 --> 00:18:07,439
selling sea lion that I've ever made

543
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:10,798
those two crosses are 100 percent

544
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:13,860
feminized and they are very viable very

545
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:15,779
potent very reliable seeds lemon Jeffrey

546
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:17,579
and orangegasm are probably those are my

547
00:18:15,779 --> 00:18:20,038
two most popular strains I've ever made

548
00:18:17,579 --> 00:18:22,319
and they're Femmes made from reversed

549
00:18:20,038 --> 00:18:24,058
female pollen so you can start a seed

550
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:26,579
company that will be very successful

551
00:18:24,058 --> 00:18:27,839
with Femme seeds if you do it properly

552
00:18:26,579 --> 00:18:30,178
if you take the proper time for

553
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:33,058
selection if you make sure

554
00:18:30,179 --> 00:18:35,759
test test test test I can't say that

555
00:18:33,058 --> 00:18:37,740
enough test a lot of testing test every

556
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:39,960
female that you plan on putting in your

557
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:41,519
breeding project for all of the problems

558
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:43,319
that a female plant could represent

559
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:45,179
let's find out first of all does it

560
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:46,980
handle heat stress does it handle cold

561
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:49,440
stress does it handle over feed does it

562
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:50,940
handle under feed does it handle uh too

563
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,100
much heat does it handle too much cold

564
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:55,140
does it handle high humidity low

565
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:57,119
humidity does it handle drought does it

566
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:58,200
handle over water I may have repeated a

567
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:00,719
couple of those things but does it

568
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:02,279
handle all of that [ __ ] do these plants

569
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,919
that you intend to breed with do they

570
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:06,660
show any type of intersex traits when

571
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:08,220
you beat them up can they handle light

572
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:10,019
interruptions can they handle Darkness

573
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:12,240
interruptions can they handle problems

574
00:19:10,019 --> 00:19:14,279
are they bug resistant are they pathogen

575
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,660
resistant are they friendly to the

576
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:16,798
grower that is something that I really

577
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:18,840
like to think about when I'm making

578
00:19:16,798 --> 00:19:20,279
seeds that will go to other people are

579
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:22,678
these seeds going to be a complete pain

580
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:24,240
in the ass or will everyday consumers be

581
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:26,160
able to complete the grow with this

582
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,720
product think about those traits when

583
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,759
you are making seeds

584
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:31,798
but the short answer is that your idea

585
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:34,319
for a breeding project of feminized only

586
00:19:31,798 --> 00:19:36,779
seeds could and will be very successful

587
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:37,918
if the selection is done properly if you

588
00:19:36,779 --> 00:19:40,619
don't select plants that have been

589
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:43,020
tested try it and true that's when you

590
00:19:40,619 --> 00:19:45,239
can run into problems if you put one

591
00:19:43,019 --> 00:19:47,460
plant into this breeding program that is

592
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:49,079
intersex all of The Offspring from that

593
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:51,720
plant do hold the potential to be

594
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:53,639
intersex plants so let's test the plants

595
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:55,558
let's remove any intersex plants from

596
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:57,900
the gene pool before we do any breeding

597
00:19:55,558 --> 00:19:59,639
intersex is the number one complaint

598
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:02,280
from a consumer when it comes to buying

599
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:04,080
seeds if those plants show nanners in

600
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:06,119
week three people are going to be pissed

601
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:07,859
if it shows nanners in week six there

602
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:09,839
are going to be extra pissed so let's

603
00:20:07,859 --> 00:20:12,240
not release anything or breed to

604
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:14,899
anything that has the opportunity or

605
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:17,460
shows the potential to display intersex

606
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:18,960
characteristics but overall if you do

607
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:21,058
the selection properly if you pay

608
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,759
attention if you stress test all of your

609
00:20:21,058 --> 00:20:25,619
plants before you breed pick your plants

610
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:27,419
now pick all of the plants you want to

611
00:20:25,619 --> 00:20:29,219
breed get a mother plant of all those

612
00:20:27,419 --> 00:20:30,840
plants have two or three clones of each

613
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:32,880
of those plants let's put all the

614
00:20:30,839 --> 00:20:34,859
potential breeders in a room let's put

615
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,360
the light schedule on 12 12 and leave it

616
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:37,678
like that for a few days but then in a

617
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:40,139
couple of days I'm gonna [ __ ] it all up

618
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:41,400
and put it back on 18-6 then a few days

619
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:42,960
later from that I'm going to over water

620
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,820
then a couple of days after that we'll

621
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,500
put it back on 12 12 and wait two weeks

622
00:20:44,819 --> 00:20:48,359
and see what happens if any of those

623
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:50,099
plants freak out guess what I'm not

624
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:51,659
going to breed with them the plants that

625
00:20:50,099 --> 00:20:54,058
continue through and flower and finish

626
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:56,700
properly those are my breeding

627
00:20:54,058 --> 00:20:58,259
candidates so run some testing verify

628
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59,460
that you've got good quality breeding

629
00:20:58,259 --> 00:21:01,319
candidates and then once you've verified

630
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:02,759
that that's when you do your pollen

631
00:21:01,319 --> 00:21:04,678
Chuck and now that is only the first

632
00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:06,599
step once you've done the pollen Chuck

633
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:08,340
and the next step is to grow out the

634
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:10,379
seeds that you have created grow

635
00:21:08,339 --> 00:21:12,720
populations as large of a population as

636
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:15,000
you can from each batch and take a lot

637
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:17,220
of notes be very observant take

638
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,038
ridiculous notes if your plant does

639
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:22,620
something one weird thing write it down

640
00:21:20,038 --> 00:21:23,940
if it does some very small thing write

641
00:21:22,619 --> 00:21:26,399
it down if it does something drastic

642
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:27,960
definitely write it down but grow out as

643
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,000
many of those as you can see if this the

644
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:32,100
seeds you have produced like we started

645
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,200
with are they intersex did you meet your

646
00:21:32,099 --> 00:21:35,819
goal did you have a breeding goal are

647
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,919
the plants that you have created better

648
00:21:35,819 --> 00:21:39,480
than both of the parent plants if

649
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:41,520
they're not quality seeds I don't

650
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:43,558
recommend sharing them selling them or

651
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:45,779
giving them out maybe use them for your

652
00:21:43,558 --> 00:21:48,839
own or maybe turn them into some sort of

653
00:21:45,779 --> 00:21:50,099
oil or put them into the compost bin you

654
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:51,720
know if you hit your goal or not you

655
00:21:50,099 --> 00:21:53,279
know if they're quality you know if this

656
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,600
is something that you would be proud to

657
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:56,279
share with the community or if it's

658
00:21:54,599 --> 00:21:57,839
something you'd rather flush and act

659
00:21:56,279 --> 00:21:59,579
like never happened don't be ashamed

660
00:21:57,839 --> 00:22:01,740
it's all about selection if you did not

661
00:21:59,579 --> 00:22:03,779
select the proper strains select again

662
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:06,240
get it going again now you did mention

663
00:22:03,779 --> 00:22:07,678
that you want to use Auto flowers so

664
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,538
you're going to have to do this with

665
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:11,100
autoflowers you're going to have to find

666
00:22:09,538 --> 00:22:12,179
an Autoflower plant that looks like a

667
00:22:11,099 --> 00:22:14,038
good breeding candidate you're gonna

668
00:22:12,179 --> 00:22:16,440
have to reverse that then put that on

669
00:22:14,038 --> 00:22:17,879
several more females I honestly do not

670
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,960
have experience breeding with auto

671
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:21,780
flowers

672
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:23,460
the selection process there would baffle

673
00:22:21,779 --> 00:22:25,619
me how do I know that that is a breeding

674
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:27,298
male if I haven't floured it out and

675
00:22:25,619 --> 00:22:30,058
finished it and see what it looks like

676
00:22:27,298 --> 00:22:31,440
so and you can't cut a clone and repeat

677
00:22:30,058 --> 00:22:33,119
the process you're gonna have to pick

678
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,340
one that looks real good

679
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:37,139
reverse it uh right before a flower

680
00:22:35,339 --> 00:22:39,298
right before it starts to flower once

681
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:40,860
again I don't mess with autoflowers so I

682
00:22:39,298 --> 00:22:43,740
recommend spraying the plant for the

683
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:45,658
first reversal about 10 days 7 to 10

684
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:47,339
days before you put it into flour so

685
00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:48,960
you're gonna have to time that spray it

686
00:22:47,339 --> 00:22:50,639
then once it goes into flour you gotta

687
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,220
spray it every three days for about 21

688
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,840
to 24 days you've got a Time match where

689
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:56,940
the females are ready for pollen at the

690
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:58,500
right time this could be a whole new set

691
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:00,360
of challenges that I don't even know how

692
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:02,460
to adjust for because I'm not familiar

693
00:23:00,359 --> 00:23:05,158
with autoflowers I wish you the best of

694
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:07,019
luck I do look forward to seeing your

695
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:08,700
breeding project if you do make seeds if

696
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:09,779
you do this send me an update let me

697
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:11,580
know how this goes because I would love

698
00:23:09,779 --> 00:23:13,500
to know how my guidance helped you and

699
00:23:11,579 --> 00:23:15,178
also maybe my guidance slowed you down

700
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:16,319
let me know what I did wrong for you all

701
00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:19,080
right let me make sure I answered

702
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:20,399
assuming I'm able I'm able to readily

703
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:22,859
reverse them are there significant

704
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,900
downsides no I do not find any downsides

705
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:26,759
I think this is a great project I think

706
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:28,620
you're on to the right start and I'm

707
00:23:26,759 --> 00:23:31,859
very excited for you to be making your
