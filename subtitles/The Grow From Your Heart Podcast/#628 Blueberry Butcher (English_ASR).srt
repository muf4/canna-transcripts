58
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:47,359
we are going to focus on a new strain

59
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:48,719
which i'm going to release for 420

60
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:50,239
let's talk about a couple of other

61
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:51,039
things before we get to that strain

62
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:52,959
highlight

63
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,320
in a previous episode i did talk about

64
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:57,199
finding a male

65
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:58,718
plant out of a pack of feminized seeds i

66
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,799
talked about how rare that could be i

67
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:02,640
talked about the opportunities for that

68
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,759
i was enlightened by a great friend i

69
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,959
don't know if they want a shout out i

70
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,799
don't know if they want their business

71
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:10,159
out there but i'm just going to say

72
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:12,480
that i was educated about a very

73
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:13,359
great male plant that came from

74
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:16,639
feminized

75
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,239
seed stock somebody had seeds um

76
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:19,759
they had a plant that they loved they

77
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,520
couldn't get to that plant anymore it

78
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:23,280
was taken from them they had seed stock

79
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,360
they had feminized seeds

80
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,120
within that femme stock they did find a

81
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,360
male and they use that male

82
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,400
to make more seeds it makes regular

83
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,120
seeds but

84
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,239
those regular seeds do seem to put out a

85
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,280
higher ratio

86
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:39,360
of females so there has been a discovery

87
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,159
i've been educated i've been updated

88
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,400
there is a likelihood of a male popping

89
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:46,799
up in female stock and when it does

90
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,519
sometimes it has proven itself to be a

91
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,239
very

92
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,319
useful tool for a good breeder so that

93
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:55,200
was an update i wanted to share with you

94
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:56,639
also we talked about using spent barley

95
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:58,399
in a previous episode

96
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:59,759
a listener asked about using spent

97
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,280
barley from a grow

98
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:02,399
from a brewery to use that in a

99
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,360
commercial grow they said there's a

100
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,760
bunch of stuff left

101
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,640
over i got mixed reviews and mixed

102
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:08,639
emotions

103
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:09,679
in response to using the spent barley

104
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:11,359
some people said

105
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,640
you're going to get way too many bugs

106
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,720
they said they tried it they had too

107
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:16,639
many bugs it had too many sugars

108
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:18,479
other people said they'd do it and it

109
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:19,439
works beautifully so i got both sides of

110
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:21,518
that story

111
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:22,878
i believe both of those people because

112
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,319
who knows what the uh

113
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:26,239
the other factors were that could have

114
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:27,119
contributed to that but i did hear

115
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,519
positives

116
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,560
and negatives i wanted to make sure to

117
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,920
update you guys

118
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,199
and share that with you because i like

119
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:34,399
the feedback i like the info and the

120
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:35,919
people that replied

121
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,439
are great people in the industry that i

122
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:39,679
greatly respect and trust

123
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:41,199
wanted to share that info all right

124
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,799
another thing i want to talk about is

125
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:45,039

132
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,680
to ask you guys one time

133
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,199

134

136
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,280
kind and totally cool

137
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:09,199
but as the leader of the irie army the

138
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,919
guy whose name is on that [ __ ]

139
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:12,000
discord

140
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:14,079
i just want to ask you one time just be

141
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,079
nice you guys are indirectly

142
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,079
representing me and it turns out you

143
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,879
were directly representing me in some

144
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,639
people's eyes

145
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:22,879
so just remember some of the [ __ ] you

146
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,160
say over there could be taken a skew

147
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:26,639
could be taken wrong

148
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,759
and it could accidentally represent the

149
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,120
ivory army

150
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,400
in a negative light so keep that in

151
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,959
light when you're uh keep that in mind

152
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:32,560

238
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,478
seeds that were bred by sub cool

239
00:07:06,478 --> 00:07:10,399
and i found a male out of that package

240
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:11,519
of seeds i found a jack the ripper male

241
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:13,439
that was beautiful

242
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:15,519
he had a beautiful structure he was a

243
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:17,598
stud ah he was a ripper

244
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:18,639
he had a nice aroma a nice structure he

245
00:07:17,598 --> 00:07:20,639
flowered well

246
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,160
ah he had the right shape to him it was

247
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,280
what i was looking for the male plant

248
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,199
had trichomes

249
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:26,719
i've posted so many photos of this male

250
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,879
jack the ripper plant the

251
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,880
whole project was posted on my instagram

252
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:32,959
on irie underscore genetics

253
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:34,319
anyway i found this jack the ripper mail

254
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:37,439
i crossed it to

255
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:39,759
my prized blueberry cookies female

256
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:41,839
i got that blueberry cookies female from

257
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,439
a commercial grow several years ago

258
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:45,359
and i've been crossing it to a lot of

259
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:46,879
things and it is an amazing plan it does

260
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,479
a lot of great breeding

261
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:49,759
i'm actually googling jack the ripper

262
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:50,959
right now because i didn't write down

263
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,400
the genetics

264
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:53,598
and uh it's got a lot of different

265
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:54,799
things in it when i get to that point

266
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:55,519
i'm going to want to be able to give you

267
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,680
the exact

268
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:59,279
details on that so i took the jack the

269
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,759
ripper mail this is the part where i

270
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:01,279
want to

271
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,520
read you the details of what jack the

272
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:04,159
ripper is and uh instead of finding the

273
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:06,079
mail

274
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,000
it brought up the serial killer of

275
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:08,959
course so i'm going to type in strain

276
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,639
instead of cross

277
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:11,918
because it's going to be a lot more info

278
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,800
anyway it's going to get us there it is

279
00:08:11,918 --> 00:08:16,959
a cross

280
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:18,079
of i'm trying to just go quickly on this

281
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:19,758
show here

282
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:21,598
of course i want to know if i'm 21 or

283
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,720
older i used to go to subcool's website

284
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:24,719
and that link is now

285
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,080
uh it's a dead link now he's probably

286
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,720
not paying the bill since he's passed

287
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:29,359
away

288
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,919
uh jack the ripper or jto jtr is the

289
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,839
flagship hybrid from subcool the dank

290
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:36,000
and it was created to make his famous

291
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,240
jacks cleaner in seed form

292
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,360
uh it's known as the fastest lemon haze

293
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,719
available

294
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,719
i just want to know the genetics it is

295
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,800
space dude and jack jack the

296
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,920
and jack herrer but i wanted a better

297
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:47,278
breakdown of it

298
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:49,039
now i feel very unprofessional i'm

299
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:50,720
probably not even going to edit this

300
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:52,399
uh i used to go to sub site you guys

301
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:56,320
that side is gone now

302
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:58,159
jack the ripper seeds

303
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,839
now let's do strain details that's

304
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:01,120
better

305
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:04,080
it's probably going to take me like seed

306
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,080
finder or something but

307
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:09,679
i don't want to use leafy that's whack

308
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,039
all right you may have noticed a quick

309
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:12,079
edit there you may not have noticed

310
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:13,599
anything i don't know what you're

311
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,278
talking about let's talk about jack the

312
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,200
ripper the male that i chose

313
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:20,240
jack the ripper is a cross of jack's

314
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:23,200
cleaner and space queen space queen is

315
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,959
uh sub cools prized mail space dude was

316
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,680
the prized mail sort of like my king

317
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:27,759
solomon

318
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:28,958
how that is what i cross everything to

319
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:30,720
space dude

320
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:32,399
is what sub cool crossed everything to

321
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,440
so we've got a jax cleaner

322
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:37,200
to space queen or the space dude male

323
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,200
let's talk about jack's cleaner that was

324
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,680
pluton and lamb's bread

325
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,800
and purple haze and northern lights

326
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:45,359
cross to

327
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:46,799
jack hair so we've got the pluton i'm

328
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,320
not sure what pluton is that's an

329
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:49,359
unknown strain but we've got lamb's

330
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,120
bread in there

331
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,399
definitely a classic one of my favorites

332
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,000
a jamaican favorite

333
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,519
uh we got purple haze in there it

334
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,159
doesn't get any more classic than purple

335
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,000
haze

336
00:09:56,159 --> 00:10:00,159
we got northern lights in there that is

337
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,679
an old school one then that is cross to

338
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:02,480
the jack hero we got a lot of great

339
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:04,719
lineage

340
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,159
in the jax cleaner that is crossed to

341
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,920
the space queen let's see if there's a

342
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:08,799
breakdown for the space queen that is

343
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:12,078
romulan

344
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:14,319
and cindy 99 so that is a lot of great

345
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:16,559
stuff going in there we got the romulan

346
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,360
also in the golden goat that is a short

347
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:19,518
squatty

348
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,278
uh faster flowering kind of a sativa

349
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,000
dominant plant that flowers quite

350
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:24,879
quickly

351
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,958
across to the cindy 99 uh big shout out

352
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:29,679
to our friends uh brothers grimm

353
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:30,078
big shout out to mr soul for the cindy99

354
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:33,679
ah

355
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:34,479
that's got um princess and p94 which is

356
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:36,958
jack herrer

357
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,560
to a mystery male so we've got jack hair

358
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:40,719
on two different ends of this

359
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:42,159
it was sort of subs kind of an idea to

360
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,360
make his version of

361
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:47,439
jack hair or a jack's cleaner seed

362
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,560
form so we've got jack the ripper the

363
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,399
reason i wanted to breed the

364
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:52,078
two jack the ripper is i really love

365
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,320
i've smoked a lot of jack the ripper it

366
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:57,519
represents subcool very well

367
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,800
um it's not using his space queen or his

368
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,399
space dude which

369
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:02,879
would have been too obvious to make a

370
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,320
jack a sub cool tribute cross

371
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:06,559
so i made a jack the ripper cross

372
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:09,278
because it's one of his flagship strains

373
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:11,359
i love the flavors and aromas that come

374
00:11:09,278 --> 00:11:13,439
from that strain it's got these uh

375
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,120
the phenotypes that i found i found a

376
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,120
key lime pie phenotype that was just

377
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,839
delicious lots of lemon

378
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,120
lemon cleaner like lemon pledges

379
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,360
bathroom cleaner

380
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,959
and lemons lots of just crazy lemon

381
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,480
candy and cleaner flavors

382
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:28,000
so i like the jack the ripper for the

383
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:31,278
buzz the flavor the aromas

384
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,759
and the growth it's got a really sativa

385
00:11:31,278 --> 00:11:35,439
like head ringing buzz but it doesn't

386
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:37,519
take a super long time to flower you

387
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,279
could get it done in 63 days

388
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:42,159
some strains that give you that potency

389
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:43,919
that buzz take closer to 70 72 days

390
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:45,600
so he'd come down a week early and he'd

391
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:47,679
still get wrecked from it which i really

392
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,639
like i like that panic attack

393
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:52,399
uh heart racing [ __ ] uh lose your

394
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:53,839
keys when they're in your hand

395
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:55,679
can't find your cell phone when it's

396
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,040
ringing in your pocket sort of stuff i

397
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:58,879
love that kind of herb

398
00:11:57,039 --> 00:12:00,879
ah waiting for the stop light to turn

399
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:02,399
green or the stop sign to turn green

400
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:03,759
waiting for the stop sign to turn green

401
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,879
is one of my favorite kind of herbs if

402
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:05,439
you got that kind of weed that's the

403
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:07,519
best

404
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,440
the kind of weed you gotta turn down the

405
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,399
radio so that you can see the street

406
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,480
signs better

407
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,559
that's this kind of herb so that is jack

408
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,560
the ripper uh that is the male that i

409
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:18,239
selected from the sub cool side of this

410
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:19,679
cross now let's talk about the female we

411
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,560
got to talk about the female i chose to

412
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:22,479
breed with

413
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:25,199
the female in this cross was the

414
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:28,320
blueberry cookies that is blueberry

415
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:31,839
cross to tahoe og then cross to

416
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,600
the thin mint cookies that's one of my

417
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,519
favorite crosses i've made

418
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,879
the leonardo that is leonardo that is

419
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,278
what leonardo is

420
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:41,039
then from there we've got six other

421
00:12:39,278 --> 00:12:43,278
outcrosses of leonardo

422
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:44,399
to make the tmnt line i reversed it to

423
00:12:43,278 --> 00:12:46,399
make that full

424
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,679
feminized line it is also the blue

425
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,958
raspberry truffle

426
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:53,278
uh that is a rise across to the

427
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:54,879
uh the blueberry cookie sorry my brain

428
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:56,480
went totally numb for a minute there

429
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:58,559
the arise pollinating the blueberry

430
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,639
cookies makes the blue raspberry truffle

431
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:02,078
i was also thinking about the blue pill

432
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:03,919
is the blueberry cookies

433
00:13:02,078 --> 00:13:05,199
to the reversed golden good so i've made

434
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:06,879
a lot of things

435
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,200
with this blueberry cookies it's one of

436
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:11,200
my favorites it kicks ass

437
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,959
now we've got the blueberry cookies

438
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,639
cross 2 jack the ripper

439
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:16,239
i don't think i've even said the name of

440
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,680
it yet which is i'm doing that on

441
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,639
purpose i'm trying to build a little bit

442
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:20,719
of suspense

443
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:22,320
to the best of my recom election i have

444
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,759
not said the name so we've talked about

445
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,639
the parents we've talked about the jack

446
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:26,879
the ripper

447
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,480
why i selected that jack the ripper to

448
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:30,958
first reason was to tribute

449
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:33,200
to tribute sub cool second reason was

450
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:34,399
flavor aroma structure flowering time

451
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,759
and potency

452
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,200
all of those things are amazing with

453
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:38,078
jack the ripper very good breeding

454
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,278
candidate

455
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:43,919
then i've got the blueberry cookies

456
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:44,720
why do i breed to that it is pungent it

457
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:46,958
is potent

458
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,879
it is vigorous you can beat the [ __ ] out

459
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:50,479
of that plant and it will recover you

460
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:51,519
could pee on it light it on fire and

461
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,759
kick it over

462
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,440
and leave and then tomorrow when you

463
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:56,958
come back that plant will be standing up

464
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,240
stronger than it ever was going

465
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:59,838
that was a good try i don't know what

466
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,079
you thought you were going to do to me

467
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,839
that plant is a boss it's a savage

468
00:14:02,078 --> 00:14:05,599
it grows amazingly well in all

469
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:08,320
conditions it tastes good

470
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,639
it is potent as [ __ ] it harvests very

471
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,480
well and it breeds very very well

472
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,839
it's a very good breeder it brings a lot

473
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,240
to the table in breeding

474
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:17,199
but it also allows a lot to be added to

475
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,959
it in breeding

476
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:20,879
it's a good ingredient it's not just a

477
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:23,599
dominant flavor in the breeding it

478
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:24,720
lets things open up to it so that's the

479
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,360
blueberry cookies

480
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,959
uh the blueberry to tahoe to the cookies

481
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,278
we got the jack the ripper which has got

482
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:32,879
the lamb's bread the ak-47

483
00:14:31,278 --> 00:14:34,320
the northern light sorry it makes aka

484
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:35,519
northern lights in my head all the time

485
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,360
there's a reason for that we'll talk

486
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,120
about in the future um

487
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,560
so we got a whole hodgepodge of genetics

488
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,720
going on in that one

489
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:44,159
um then do i want to tell you the name

490
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,600
of it or do i want to talk i

491
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:47,039
why i selected them that blueberry

492
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,560
cookies is a champ and i knew they would

493
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:50,399
breed well together

494
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:51,759
something about when i see two plants i

495
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:53,198
just go ooh you

496
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:55,039
it's like just hanging out with friends

497
00:14:53,198 --> 00:14:56,719
hanging out with two people you know

498
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:58,078
and now i used to say hanging out with a

499
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,759
guy and you know a girl but

500
00:14:58,078 --> 00:15:01,519
it's 20 21 you're hanging out with a

501
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:03,759
person and you go hey

502
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:05,440
you know bill you may really like steve

503
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:06,559
or you may really like emily i don't

504
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,160
know which [ __ ] one but

505
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:09,119
hypothetically you may like one of them

506
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:11,120
and you just know it

507
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,639
and you hook bill up with steve or emily

508
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,879
and they got a [ __ ] completely happy

509
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,799
future just because you could see it

510
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:17,919
in my analogy it's got to be bill and

511
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:19,278
emily because they're going to breed

512
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:21,039
sorry steve

513
00:15:19,278 --> 00:15:22,159
but bill and emily are going to breed

514
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:23,439
and they make beautiful children and

515
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:24,879
then you go haha i got to

516
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,720
i got to predict that that happened so

517
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:28,320
my plants i could just see it sometimes

518
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,199
i know that if i pollinate that girl

519
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,800
with that male

520
00:15:29,198 --> 00:15:32,879
the offspring is gonna be [ __ ]

521
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:36,000
stellar sometimes i just know that

522
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:37,679
so i took the jack the ripper male

523
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,759
i took the blueberry cookies female

524
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:40,000
don't worry i also pollinated a bunch of

525
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:42,000
other

526
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,320
females when i did this so there will be

527
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,120
other females released with other cool

528
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,800
names

529
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,440
um we'll talk about that in a future

530
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:51,120
episode i made jack the ripper f2s

531
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,800
that was a really fun project so i did

532
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,560
the pollination we made

533
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:55,919
the project i've talked about why i've

534
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:56,879
talked about the selections talked about

535
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:58,399
the parents

536
00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:00,799

538
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:08,240

539
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:10,078
crazy potent sativa dominant hybrids

540
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,680
that smell and taste are you ready for

541
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:13,359
these flavor descriptions these came

542
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:14,399
from my testers because i didn't make

543
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:17,839
these up

544
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:21,198

549
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:31,440
and somebody else told me they smelled

550
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,959
like purple flintstone

551
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,800
vitamins i think the red bull and

552
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:35,599
flintstone vitamins may be the same

553
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:37,120
aroma

554
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,720
somebody else said it was vitamins i

555
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,600
thought it was red bull we're getting

556
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,879

557
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:45,440

red bull vitamins and then a lot of

569
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:06,318
people said

570
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:06,880
lemon cleaner smells like chemicals and

571
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:08,240
cleaner

572
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,160
so there are a lot of wonderful

573
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,838
marvelous aromas coming from this

574
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,919
some of them almost kind of burn your

575
00:17:11,838 --> 00:17:15,918
eyes in a good good way

576
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:17,439
the concentrates didn't get to smoke a

577
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:20,240
lot they went really quickly

578
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:22,319
the concentrates were almost uh lemon

579
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,959
spicy it was almost so much lemons that

580
00:17:22,318 --> 00:17:25,199
it like

581
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,959
hit your nose and cleaned your sinuses

582
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:28,798
you could almost feel it

583
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,400
i heated up the dab nail i could almost

584
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:33,759
feel it and it was like a

585
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:35,840
a saucy diamond-y consistency uh

586
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:38,160
when i would put it into the banger i

587
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:40,720
could almost taste it and feel the

588
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:43,200
effervescence hitting my lungs and nose

589
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:45,200
before the dab even felt like it

590
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,038
vaporized or volatized or whatever it

591
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:50,160
did in my banger before i saw

592
00:17:47,038 --> 00:17:51,519
smoke or vapor in the the rig i could

593
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,558
feel those terps hitting me

594
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:56,480
it was like spicy lemony like ah

595
00:17:54,558 --> 00:17:58,319
if you've ever cleaned cleaned anything

596
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,880
with orange cleaner it was like using

597
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:00,960
lemon

598
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,320
cleaner it was very terpy very

599
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,840
terpadelic with a little bit of a

600
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:05,439
spiciness to it

601
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:06,959
i'm [ __ ] rambling so this could be a

602
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,160
long fun episode i'm really having a

603
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,519
good time behind the mic today i've

604
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,798
needed to get behind mike for a minute

605
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:12,960
and let loose

606
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:14,240
let's talk about the buzz a lot of

607
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,960
people said the buzz

608
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,720
was very social some people said they

609
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,240
wish they would let it go longer because

610
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,880
they cut it too early and they got a

611
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,480
really

612
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:26,799
high racy head buzz i got the word

613
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,400
talkative and chatty from a lot of

614
00:18:26,798 --> 00:18:30,079
people who tested this they were

615
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,640
so when you smoke this you turn into me

616
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:34,960
you just start [ __ ] talking just

617
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,000
talkative and chatty but sometimes you

618
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,440
know what the [ __ ] you're talking about

619
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,119
it'll just talk you into circles you'll

620
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:42,080
talk yourself into space

621
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:42,879
uh it's mind moving as something i wrote

622
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:45,119
um

623
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,880
something about those jack the ripper uh

624
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:49,038
jack harrow terps in there mixed with

625
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,039
the girl scout cookies terps in there

626
00:18:49,038 --> 00:18:53,200
if something just moves your brain

627
00:18:51,038 --> 00:18:55,119
sometimes it can give you a little bit

628
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,400
of panic some people reported it was too

629
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:57,839
much too heavy

630
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,840
they said when they cut it down too

631
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:01,199
early they were a little bit panicky a

632
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:02,639
little bit racy and a little bit

633
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,919
bug-eyed and they wish they'd let it go

634
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,840
a little bit longer

635
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:07,679
so it'll make you talkative it'll make

636
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:09,678
you social it'll make you chatty

637
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:12,400
it's mind-moving sometimes it'll give

638
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:14,640
you panic but it will give you a strong

639
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,240
moving head buzz it'll get you going

640
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,799
really good

641
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,960
so that is the consumption factors also

642
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:22,639
i noticed it make sure it makes my eyes

643
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,079
completely [ __ ] red i don't know if

644
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,600
it did that to anybody else

645
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:27,279
cannabis doesn't make my eyes red i

646
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:29,279
gotta smoke hard to get red eyes it's

647
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:30,798
got to be like the late night session

648
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:32,879
once i'm burned out and maxed out for

649
00:19:30,798 --> 00:19:34,240
the day but ah this stuff

650
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,760
smoking on this strain that i haven't

651
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,960
named yet i'm trying to dodge the name

652
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:38,319
i'm gonna give you the name just to be

653
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,400
fun here pretty soon but

654
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:42,000
this stuff did make my eyes completely

655
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,960
super red so we got flavors we got

656
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,200
aromas

657
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,880
we got the buzz now let's talk about

658
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,798
some of the most important factors to a

659
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,960
lot of you this is growing this cannabis

660
00:19:48,798 --> 00:19:52,400
how is this going to work for you

661
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,319
one thing i want to talk about is these

662
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,400
were some of the healthiest as

663
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:58,720
healthiest most healthy seeds

664
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,559
i have ever produced i've been making

665
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:03,200
seeds for a long time

666
00:20:00,558 --> 00:20:03,839
sometimes some plants just make ugly

667
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,840
seeds

668
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:08,158
sometimes some plants make beautiful

669
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:08,879
seeds almost every seed that came out of

670
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:11,200
this run

671
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,200
was beautiful what was the difference

672
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,360
the new addition the new anomaly the new

673
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,679
change up

674
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:19,279
canon leds from black sail market big

675
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:22,640
shout out to my buddy keith it

676
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:23,918
black sail market erg those canon leds

677
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,880
made my seeds

678
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:28,000
beautiful bigger fatter robust it could

679
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,559
have been that male

680
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,919
but ah man those seeds were beautiful i

681
00:20:30,558 --> 00:20:33,519
think it was the light i think it was

682
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,840
the light because every seed sometimes

683
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:37,038
you get some shitty seeds in the mix

684
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:38,399
the seeds on the bottom of the plant

685
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:40,240
don't look good you get some white dead

686
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,720
seeds but didn't get any of those

687
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,599
all of the seeds were [ __ ] awesome so

688
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,759
some of the biggest

689
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:48,558
baddest healthiest most beautiful seeds

690
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:52,000
i've ever bred they were done under leds

691
00:20:48,558 --> 00:20:54,798
i got a lot of reports of really good

692
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,640
female to male ratios a lot of these

693
00:20:54,798 --> 00:20:58,558
plants are popping up females so that is

694
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,159
really awesome for you guys out there

695
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:02,399
i can't make any guarantees but the

696
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:05,360
reports a lot of females

697
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,000
also a lot of very good germination

698
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:09,038
rates

699
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,519
90 to 100 german germination rates

700
00:21:09,038 --> 00:21:12,879
from almost everybody i sent seeds to

701
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:14,879
the people that said they didn't get

702
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:17,120
good germs they said themselves

703
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,960
i [ __ ] something up so i'm gonna say

704
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:21,359
we got more than 90

705
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,400
germination which is uh that qualifies

706
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:25,439
in my book

707
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,960
uh these plants veg very vigorously they

708
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,400
don't veg like something that would be

709
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,440
crossed with a rise they don't have that

710
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,480
hyper vigor

711
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:34,960
but they veg quickly and they veg very

712
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,880
strongly these plants are strong

713
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,319
uh where are we going i lost my place in

714
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:41,919
my notes there we go

715
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:43,918
uh they make that classic christmas tree

716
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:45,360
kind of a menorah shape they grow

717
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:47,200
branchy bottom and they grow

718
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:48,879
the top goes real tall the other

719
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,080
branches try to catch up to that

720
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:53,280
we're going to talk more about how to

721
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:55,839
deal with that in a minute here um

722
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:57,440
in veg there's nothing super indicative

723
00:21:55,839 --> 00:22:00,158
of which phenotype you've got

724
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,919
other than leaf size we'll talk more

725
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:03,360
specifically about phenotypes later in

726
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,720
the episode but

727
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:07,519
you're not going to be able to tell

728
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:10,798
which phenotype you've got early in veg

729
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:13,839
unless you've got huge maple leaf

730
00:22:10,798 --> 00:22:15,599
size leaves um those are the platinum

731
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:16,959
cookies heavy phenotypes if you get the

732
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:19,199
super thin leaf

733
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,720
that's jack anything in the middle there

734
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,120
or it could be kind of lamb's bready

735
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,279
jack

736
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:24,639
lamb's bread leaning i'm not super

737
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:25,918
experienced with the lamb spread i can't

738
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,600
tell you enough details to know if

739
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:29,759
that's what i'm seeing

740
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:31,279
but uh most of them are going to lie

741
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:33,119
anywhere in between there you're going

742
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:35,038
to get big fat leaves or real skinny

743
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:37,119
leaves or anywhere in between because

744
00:22:35,038 --> 00:22:38,879
this is a crazy hybrid with a lot of

745
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:40,399
different genetics

746
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,720
so you're going to see big mashups of

747
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:45,440
different things most of the plants

748
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:47,600
will make one big dominant top and a

749
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,440
nice bushy bottom i know bushy bottom is

750
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:51,439
going to get a lot of people's attention

751
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,120
we all like them big bottom girls it

752
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,720
does get that big fat bottom but it's

753
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:56,558
gonna grow one main top and it's gonna

754
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,759
keep growing that christmas tree menorah

755
00:22:56,558 --> 00:22:59,759
sort of shape

756
00:22:57,759 --> 00:23:00,879
i generally top it we're gonna talk more

757
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:03,359
about that

758
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,960
i call it making it makes a menorah or a

759
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:07,439
christmas tree with what i call the

760
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,960
leader one ambitious [ __ ] leader

761
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,798
you gotta knock that leader out in my

762
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:13,120
opinion most of the time

763
00:23:10,798 --> 00:23:14,720
i suggest topping these plants i keep

764
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:15,359
saying it's gonna make that one liter

765
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,360
top

766
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:19,119
you got all the bottoms coming up cut

767
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:19,759
out that main top and then it creates a

768
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:22,319
nice

769
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:24,000
like a shrub like just a nice bush if

770
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:24,798
you put it in a big pot these plants

771
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,240
will spread out

772
00:23:24,798 --> 00:23:30,480
really nicely so when you put these

773
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,759
plants into flower they will transition

774
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,519
into bloom

775
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:34,960
very quickly as something i've noticed

776
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:37,519
that could be because i'm growing under

777
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:41,120
leds and when i switch from

778
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:43,038
18 6 to 11 13 they trigger into flowers

779
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:45,439
super quickly but it is something i

780
00:23:43,038 --> 00:23:47,679
observed these plants went more quickly

781
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:49,600
than other plants in the same room

782
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:51,840
they triggered quickly into flour they

783
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:53,278
transfer transition quickly into the

784
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:56,959
bloom phase

785
00:23:53,278 --> 00:23:58,400
these plants love being tied down

786
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,319
they're weird girls they want to be

787
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,880
twisted popped and tortured and held

788
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:03,359
down

789
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,320
you can do that to these girls pop them

790
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:06,959
twist them

791
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:09,200
be careful but you can do that they like

792
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,000
to be tied down trellis down and netted

793
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,240
down

794
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,919
so you can do that uh into like week

795
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,240
three or four a flower

796
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:17,120
they get soft and vine like these plants

797
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,960
will grow

798
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:20,399
with like some plants are known to get

799
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,400
woody and hard

800
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,640
and they don't bend and pop and twist as

801
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,600
easily as these plants will these plants

802
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,640
get like

803
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:30,319
ah like a sappy wire structure like you

804
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,960
could bend them and wrap them around a

805
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:33,678
vine

806
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,159
they're very very twisty and viny they

807
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:35,919
pop

808
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:37,919
pop and twist them very carefully

809
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:39,600
because of that viney structure

810
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:40,960
sometimes you'll just blow up that whole

811
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:42,319
stem you'll go to twist it

812
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,558
it'll just rip off or you'll just

813
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:46,240
explode the whole thing but they're soft

814
00:24:44,558 --> 00:24:47,359
they're very soft if you take care of

815
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,278
them and stay

816
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:51,038
nice and healthy they'll be soft and

817
00:24:49,278 --> 00:24:52,480
supple and pliable and bright bright

818
00:24:51,038 --> 00:24:54,400
green

819
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,319
tie them down twist them they will need

820
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,679
some supports because they're so twisty

821
00:24:56,319 --> 00:24:59,439
so pliable

822
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:01,519
some of those longer branches especially

823
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:03,600
your bottom branches are gonna get

824
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:06,000
droopy and floppy give them some love

825
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:07,359
give them some support some plant viagra

826
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,960
if you will

827
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:11,519
now i keep saying that these plants will

828
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,558
stay soft and really light green and

829
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:15,440
very supple

830
00:25:12,558 --> 00:25:16,879
and very pliable that is if we properly

831
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,038
feed them these plants will get a little

832
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,559
bit picky about the nutrients you can't

833
00:25:19,038 --> 00:25:22,960
over feed them but

834
00:25:20,558 --> 00:25:24,798
they like a lot of nitrogen and veg and

835
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:27,440
you gotta drop that [ __ ] out almost

836
00:25:24,798 --> 00:25:29,038
immediately as you transition into flour

837
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,159
pay attention to these plants because

838
00:25:29,038 --> 00:25:32,720
they're picky

839
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:34,159
with nutrients if you over feed them

840
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,919
when they go into flower

841
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:37,760
they don't make big buds they just make

842
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:39,840
little sparse buds and they make a lot

843
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:42,798
of branching and a lot of leaves

844
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:44,639
if your leaves are not doing the normal

845
00:25:42,798 --> 00:25:46,558
leaf shape thing you expect if they're

846
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,880
starting to kind of mutate a little bit

847
00:25:46,558 --> 00:25:51,038
they're getting too much nitrogen in my

848
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:54,240
experience that could be one very

849
00:25:51,038 --> 00:25:56,079
quick indicator of too much nitrogen um

850
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:58,000
they'll take the feedings they'll take a

851
00:25:56,079 --> 00:25:59,759
little bit of heat they're going to get

852
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,519
super frosty and they're going to make

853
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:04,158
what i call taco leaves

854
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:05,918
or what also is known as a resin rail

855
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:08,480
the leaves that come out of the

856
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:10,799
the main buds are going to get resin on

857
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,480
them very quickly when it gets warm in

858
00:26:10,798 --> 00:26:13,278
the grow room or a little bit humid in

859
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,319
the grow room

860
00:26:13,278 --> 00:26:18,640
they will canoe or taco on you

861
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:20,798
i don't think that is from the room

862
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,360
being too hot i think that is just a

863
00:26:20,798 --> 00:26:22,798
trait

864
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:24,879
from the jack the ripper that is

865
00:26:22,798 --> 00:26:27,278
something i saw the jack the ripper do

866
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:29,120
some of the phenotypes from jtr did that

867
00:26:27,278 --> 00:26:30,880
some of the offspring are doing that

868
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:33,359
i don't think there's a problem in the

869
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:35,200
room i don't think you're [ __ ] up i

870
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:36,000
think that it just wants to taco up and

871
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,000
make room

872
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,759
for resin because the trichomes pop up

873
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,759
out of the top of that taco

874
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:43,278
i don't think it's your fault so if

875
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:45,200
you're not over feeding it

876
00:26:43,278 --> 00:26:47,278
if your ph isn't [ __ ] up and if it's

877
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,000
not too hot or too humid or too dry in

878
00:26:47,278 --> 00:26:49,679
the room

879
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,278
you're getting a little bit of like just

880
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:53,360
leaf tacoing a little bit of leaf

881
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:56,480
canoeing with trichomes on top

882
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:59,519
don't panic that is what this plant does

883
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,159
um another thing this plant does not

884
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:02,240
tolerate

885
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:04,000
cold if you get them cold they'll go

886
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:07,120
yellow they'll stop eating they'll get

887
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,558
pissed off at you another thing don't

888
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:10,399
over defoliate

889
00:27:08,558 --> 00:27:12,720
i talk about leafing the plants that i

890
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,400
breed don't do that to this plant

891
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,159
the girl scout cookies doesn't like

892
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,080
being defoliated heavily

893
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:20,080
uh the jack herrera is not a fan of

894
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:21,839
super defoliation guess what

895
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:24,000
the blueberry cookies jack the ripper

896
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:25,038
cross does not like to be defoliated

897
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,519
heavily

898
00:27:25,038 --> 00:27:28,480
moderate defoliation at best don't go

899
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:30,079
super hard

900
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,240
it likes the leaves this plant is

901
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:34,079
relying on those skinny leaves for

902
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,120
energy so don't piss it off and take too

903
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:38,158
many off

904
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:40,239
over defoliating getting it cold over

905
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:42,000
feeding it some of the things we think

906
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,079
would boost up some plants

907
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,440
ah those things are what piss off this

908
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:48,000
plant this is a little bit

909
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,840
more of a challenging plant you can't be

910
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,519
oh that new guy that tries to give it

911
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:52,959
more [ __ ] and do more to it to make it

912
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:53,839
speed up this is one of those plants

913
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,720
that less

914
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:58,480
will do better i think this plant it's

915
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,839
got a lot of hodgepodge genetics but i

916
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,399
think this would have been found more

917
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:02,000
like

918
00:28:00,398 --> 00:28:03,519
in some tropical area where people

919
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,119
couldn't have gotten to it and it would

920
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:06,398
have just been [ __ ] up and abandoned

921
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:07,439
by people and then it would just been

922
00:28:06,398 --> 00:28:08,000
out there in nature and it would have

923
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,240
gone

924
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,599
crazy tall and gotten out of control and

925
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,200
it didn't need a lot of attention it

926
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:14,798
didn't want you to defoliate it didn't

927
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,319
want you to give it too much care

928
00:28:14,798 --> 00:28:18,079
just let it grow and give it supports

929
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:21,119
and i think it'll be okay

930
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:22,639
um also i think it doesn't like wind a

931
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:23,599
lot of the phenotypes i grew and

932
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,679
experienced

933
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:27,278
everybody by the fan got pissed off the

934
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:28,720
plants back behind the fan they were all

935
00:28:27,278 --> 00:28:30,398
perfect they were cool

936
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,399
the jack the ripper crosses that were by

937
00:28:30,398 --> 00:28:33,439
the fan they do not tolerate the wind

938
00:28:32,398 --> 00:28:35,199
very well so

939
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,640
don't give them too much wind don't blow

940
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,159
too hard on them

941
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,640
and don't get them too cold the cold

942
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:42,640
pissed them off and made them slow down

943
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,759
something i can say these plants grow

944
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,600
really well

945
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:47,119
until you piss them off if you stay out

946
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:49,038
of their way keep them happy

947
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:51,439
give them a solid feed pay attention to

948
00:28:49,038 --> 00:28:52,879
the feed high nitrogen in the beginning

949
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,480
taper off that nitrogen

950
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,640
start raising up your phosphorus and

951
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,720
potassium just do it just like you

952
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,480
should a basic plant they'll work very

953
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,319
well the minute you screw something up

954
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,399
with these plants once they go yellow

955
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:06,798
once they go angry you're [ __ ]

956
00:29:04,398 --> 00:29:07,759
um they get yellow they'll start

957
00:29:06,798 --> 00:29:10,319
crisping up

958
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:10,960
cold will do it too much moisture will

959
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:13,038
do it

960
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,558
too much nutrients will do it they're

961
00:29:13,038 --> 00:29:15,919
really easy to grow once

962
00:29:14,558 --> 00:29:18,879
once you get them going but once they're

963
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:21,360
angry it is over i think the haze

964
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,720
makes it go super fast and the og makes

965
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:25,278
it super finicky

966
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,558
you cross that it's super quick to be

967
00:29:25,278 --> 00:29:28,480
super finicky

968
00:29:26,558 --> 00:29:29,918
uh as soon as something goes wrong it

969
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,440
lets you know so if you're growing in

970
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:33,600
hydro keep an eye on it

971
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,200
if you're a soil or soilless mix person

972
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:36,398
uh you may have some time to rebound or

973
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,319
recover but

974
00:29:36,398 --> 00:29:41,038
uh it's going to let you know when it's

975
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:42,798
got problems also stay on top of up

976
00:29:41,038 --> 00:29:44,319
potting and root bound nests because

977
00:29:42,798 --> 00:29:46,398
when this one gets root bound

978
00:29:44,319 --> 00:29:48,158
she'll stop growing as soon as the roots

979
00:29:46,398 --> 00:29:50,158
hit the outside of that pot it just goes

980
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:52,000
no i'm done i like to test things in

981
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:53,679
cups and get them started in cups

982
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,278
these little [ __ ] hit the edges of

983
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:55,919
the cups and just stopped they're like

984
00:29:55,278 --> 00:29:57,038
nope

985
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,559
i thought they were mad i thought they

986
00:29:57,038 --> 00:30:00,000
were [ __ ] angry they're just at the

987
00:29:58,558 --> 00:30:00,879
edge i had to uphold them as soon as i

988
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,679
outpotted them

989
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:05,520
shabang they went crazy again so uh also

990
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:06,880
a couple of them tried to flower on me

991
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:08,480
once they got to root bound that is

992
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:11,840
something to think about

993
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:13,120
it likes all of the light some plants

994
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:15,199
some of the plants had to turn down the

995
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:16,319
canon leds move them right out from

996
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,278
underneath there because they don't like

997
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:19,759
all that light

998
00:30:17,278 --> 00:30:21,359
put the jack the ripper crosses directly

999
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:22,000
under the light put the light on the

1000
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:24,558
jack the ripper

1001
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,119
crosses feed the light to these plants

1002
00:30:24,558 --> 00:30:27,440
it wants

1003
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:28,798
all of the [ __ ] light did i mention

1004
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,960
that these plants want light

1005
00:30:28,798 --> 00:30:32,720
they will take it it's got lamb's bread

1006
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,159
in there it's got jack hair in there

1007
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,000
it can take some [ __ ] light give it

1008
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:37,360
all the light it doesn't like

1009
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,759
wind i mentioned that if you put them

1010
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:41,199
too close to the fan they get pissy

1011
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:42,798
if it gets too dry in there they get

1012
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,679
pissy if it gets too wet in there guess

1013
00:30:42,798 --> 00:30:45,278
what

1014
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:47,038
they get pissy you got to keep it just

1015
00:30:45,278 --> 00:30:49,038
right in there

1016
00:30:47,038 --> 00:30:50,879
they're a little bit weird some of the

1017
00:30:49,038 --> 00:30:53,359
plants in the room i mentioned this

1018
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:55,120
got fried by leds i put some new plants

1019
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:57,119
in a room and with a new built room with

1020
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:57,759
some brand new leds the tops of some of

1021
00:30:57,119 --> 00:30:59,759
them

1022
00:30:57,759 --> 00:31:01,440
roasted guess what the jack the rippers

1023
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:03,038
didn't do they didn't roast

1024
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,640
they just took it everything crossed to

1025
00:31:03,038 --> 00:31:06,480
the jack the ripper was fine

1026
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:08,480
with being punished by too much light

1027
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,679
they were unscathed is the word i put on

1028
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:13,038
my notes

1029
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:15,679
the next part to talk about they stretch

1030
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:17,278
um these plants will stretch on you the

1031
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:18,399
first few days of flower they're going

1032
00:31:17,278 --> 00:31:21,440
to take off

1033
00:31:18,398 --> 00:31:23,678
but but but but top them not in flour

1034
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:25,038
before you flour them top them pop them

1035
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:26,320
and twist them and that will slow down

1036
00:31:25,038 --> 00:31:29,359
the stretch give them a nice

1037
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:32,158
feed give them a nice npk and they will

1038
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:34,079
not take off too fast on you but they do

1039
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:36,159
stretch they get tall on you i lost my

1040
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:39,359
place on my notes

1041
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:42,399
uh where are we oh

1042
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:44,158
um feeding feeding the skinny leaf

1043
00:31:42,398 --> 00:31:45,678
phenotype oh i missed this part

1044
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:47,840
they are super easy to clone when you

1045
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:49,919
take that top off of that plant

1046
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:51,678
clone it because they are super easy to

1047
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:53,038
clone they love to clone you can

1048
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:55,679
basically just set it down

1049
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:57,038
it will make a clone feeding the skinny

1050
00:31:55,679 --> 00:32:00,240
leaf phenotype wants

1051
00:31:57,038 --> 00:32:02,480
less food and higher ph but

1052
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:05,120
don't slow down the calcium i said less

1053
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:07,919
food don't knock out the calcium

1054
00:32:05,119 --> 00:32:09,119
so i'll repeat that the skinnier leaved

1055
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:11,360
phenotypes

1056
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:12,398
want less food so if you've got a real

1057
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:15,359
thin phenotype

1058
00:32:12,398 --> 00:32:16,479
thinly phenotype it wants less food and

1059
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:18,719
a higher ph

1060
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:20,159
but it also wants more calcium don't

1061
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,640
slow down the calmag

1062
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:24,880
on that thin leaf phenotype all of the

1063
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:26,320
phenotypes seem to love calcium later in

1064
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,039
life not when they're little they got

1065
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:28,720
pissy

1066
00:32:27,038 --> 00:32:30,720
let me give them a lot of calmag a lot

1067
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,679
of calcium later on in life they really

1068
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,679
loved it

1069
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:36,640
ah they seem to feed moderately don't

1070
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:38,399
over feed give them that calmag

1071
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,840
overfeeding nitrogen that's the note i

1072
00:32:38,398 --> 00:32:42,558
wanted to make sure to get you

1073
00:32:39,839 --> 00:32:43,199
makes them stretchy and leafy but they

1074
00:32:42,558 --> 00:32:46,319
don't make

1075
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:48,159
buds so early in flower

1076
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:49,519
taper off that nitrogen but pay

1077
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:50,799
attention to what they're doing if

1078
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:53,038
they're getting yellow keep that

1079
00:32:50,798 --> 00:32:54,960
nitrogen going but don't overdo it

1080
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:57,278
they would rather be fed so if you're a

1081
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,960
guy or a gal that feeds once every three

1082
00:32:57,278 --> 00:32:59,679
days and then gives it water and then

1083
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,919
water and then

1084
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:03,519
feed i said that kind of weird if you

1085
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:05,278
feed and then once a week and then give

1086
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:07,120
it water throughout the week maybe feed

1087
00:33:05,278 --> 00:33:07,919
twice a week maybe feed three times a

1088
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:09,839
week

1089
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:11,600
if you're growing in cocoa or hydro

1090
00:33:09,839 --> 00:33:14,240
definitely feed these [ __ ]

1091
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:16,158
every time pay attention your ppms don't

1092
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,319
go too high they would rather have

1093
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:20,880
low feeding every day than a high

1094
00:33:18,319 --> 00:33:24,079
feeding uh one at a time so

1095
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:26,960
uh feed them low and often they love

1096
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:29,599
cocoa and otter auto water systems they

1097
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,319
go crazy and aeroponics and cocoa they

1098
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:33,759
clone

1099
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:36,960
like [ __ ] crazy and aeroponics cloner

1100
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:38,398
um they explode in an easy cloner these

1101
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,519
plants i said it right here several

1102
00:33:38,398 --> 00:33:42,239
times they make

1103
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:43,278
crazy crazy roots but once those roots

1104
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:46,480
hit the walls

1105
00:33:43,278 --> 00:33:47,759
they stop growing let's talk about how i

1106
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,960
would grow these plants i feel like i've

1107
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:50,240
got a lot to say and i feel like i've

1108
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,798
been going for a long time but that's

1109
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,079
cool

1110
00:33:50,798 --> 00:33:53,918
ah let me take a drink and we'll

1111
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:57,678
continue with this i'm gonna take a sip

1112
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:57,679
this is how i would grow these plants

1113
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:05,359
i would veg them in a cup or a six inch

1114
00:34:04,398 --> 00:34:07,038
net pot

1115
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:08,398
until you see them stop growing that

1116
00:34:07,038 --> 00:34:10,480
means they're root bound

1117
00:34:08,398 --> 00:34:13,039
as soon as they're caught then put them

1118
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:14,960
in a three or a five or a seven gallon

1119
00:34:13,039 --> 00:34:15,759
pot i would only transplant them one

1120
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,918
time

1121
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:19,359
because they grow so vigorously that

1122
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:22,158
that's a waste of time

1123
00:34:19,358 --> 00:34:22,960
doing staggered or graduated pots go

1124
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:26,079
from your cup

1125
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:28,960
to your final big daddy final shoes

1126
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:29,679
uh your graduation pot so i would

1127
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,240
recommend

1128
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:33,599
either nine no let me start here on this

1129
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:36,959
note i would recommend

1130
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:37,919
either five ah no that's not what i

1131
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,559
meant to even write

1132
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:41,358
i would recommend four seven gallon pots

1133
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:44,559
or

1134
00:34:41,358 --> 00:34:45,918
six five gallon pots veg those

1135
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:48,320
so let me say that again because i did

1136
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:51,519
stumble through the start of that four

1137
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:53,359
seven gallon pots per light this is in

1138
00:34:51,519 --> 00:34:54,878
like a five by five area

1139
00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:57,199
uh we're gonna base this on a five by

1140
00:34:54,878 --> 00:35:00,480
five ten or a one thousand watt light

1141
00:34:57,199 --> 00:35:03,118
or one of keith's canon leds i would say

1142
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:05,039
four seven gallon pots so that's a

1143
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:06,400
section about this big as the pot

1144
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:08,320
you'll start spreading them out as they

1145
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:11,280
grow four or seven gallons

1146
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:12,160
or six five gallons that's just a little

1147
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,160
bit smaller

1148
00:35:12,159 --> 00:35:16,159
and a couple more plants depending on

1149
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:18,399
your plant count this could be uh

1150
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:19,679
very very influential if you got a low

1151
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,519
plant count do

1152
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:23,039
more big [ __ ] plants that's the way

1153
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:24,719
to do it if you got unlimited plants

1154
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:26,239
just do a bunch of little plants and veg

1155
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:29,039
for like a week and flip them

1156
00:35:26,239 --> 00:35:29,439
anyway i would do four seven gallon pots

1157
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:31,440
or

1158
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:33,039
six five gallon pots veg those until

1159
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:36,159
they are about knee high

1160
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:39,440
i'm a tall dude go to my knee

1161
00:35:36,159 --> 00:35:40,239
tall knee uh top those at that time then

1162
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,800
spread it out

1163
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:43,439
with either a tomato cage or a trellis

1164
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,119
net or

1165
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,800
sticks you can put sticks in there

1166
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:48,720
angling out you can put them angling

1167
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,400
in however you want to do it but spread

1168
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:51,279
those tops out so light gets to that

1169
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,880
whole plant

1170
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,560
uh leaf it a little bit so the plant

1171
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,200
penetrates so the light penetrates in

1172
00:35:54,559 --> 00:35:57,279
there

1173
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:59,358
so then you've got either four sevens or

1174
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:01,440
six fives veg to knee-high

1175
00:35:59,358 --> 00:36:02,799
top them spread them out let them

1176
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:05,920
recover then flip them

1177
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:08,160
or or here's another option i would do

1178
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:09,039
nine three gallon pots on the same

1179
00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:10,799
footprint

1180
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:13,119
just smaller plants we're gonna veg for

1181
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:15,359
less time uh we're gonna veg for like

1182
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:17,358
two three maybe four weeks at all

1183
00:36:15,358 --> 00:36:18,400
in those [ __ ] small pots then flip

1184
00:36:17,358 --> 00:36:19,838
them do not

1185
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,358
top them in those small pots because

1186
00:36:19,838 --> 00:36:23,279
they're gonna get tall you just want

1187
00:36:21,358 --> 00:36:24,639
that big one glory bud in there

1188
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:27,040
put a stick in there to hold up that

1189
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:30,400
glory cola the rest will support itself

1190
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:32,800
so either four sevens six

1191
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,480
fives or nine threes is the way i would

1192
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,800
do it if you do the threes don't top

1193
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,639
them

1194
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:40,000
the other ones definitely do top them um

1195
00:36:38,639 --> 00:36:42,000
one more thing to talk about these

1196
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,039
plants are very bug resistant from what

1197
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,760
i've noticed

1198
00:36:43,039 --> 00:36:46,559
what i've also noticed is jack herrer

1199
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,880
crosses

1200
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:51,119
and blueberry crosses are both bug

1201
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:53,760
resistant we got both of those in here

1202
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:55,440
so we're getting a lot of bug resistance

1203
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:57,599
something i should mention

1204
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,519
some of the people did report getting a

1205
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:02,160
rash from trimming

1206
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:02,960
these trees people that are allergic to

1207
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:05,759
hazes

1208
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:07,440
and blue dream are also allergic to this

1209
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:09,359
plant i've done an episode

1210
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,720
all about plant rashes and getting a

1211
00:37:09,358 --> 00:37:13,440
rash from trimming

1212
00:37:10,719 --> 00:37:14,480
guess what those same people got a rash

1213
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,079
from trimming

1214
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:18,400
this cross it's something in the

1215
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:20,240
blueberry it's something in the haze

1216
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:22,559
something in that is giving them a rash

1217
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:23,519
and a histamine reaction so people are

1218
00:37:22,559 --> 00:37:25,358
getting hives

1219
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:26,480
and an arm rash from trimming this

1220
00:37:25,358 --> 00:37:27,519
strain i just want to give you a

1221
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:30,400
disclaimer

1222
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:30,880
if the hazes or the blueberry if blue

1223
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,960

00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,960
once it's dried and cured but they

1227
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:41,838

1228

this is blueberry butcher beautiful name

1287
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:35,598
let's talk about the phenotype which i

1288
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:38,560
have named the blueberry butcher

1289
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:39,119
it is the blueberry cookies structure

1290
00:39:38,559 --> 00:39:42,239
but

1291
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:45,280
the jack the ripper rotten mango

1292
00:39:42,239 --> 00:39:46,959
lemon lime funk red bull smell

1293
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:48,800
all right that's a lot of stuff to take

1294
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:52,000
in the blueberry butcher

1295
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:55,200
it is the blueberry cookies structure

1296
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,480
it's tall it's got jagged leaves it just

1297
00:39:55,199 --> 00:39:58,319
looks like a classic

1298
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:00,079
cannabis plant if you saw the silhouette

1299
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,200
you'd go that's the weed they used to

1300
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:03,839
put in pictures

1301
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:05,919
like it is [ __ ] photogenic weed it's

1302
00:40:03,838 --> 00:40:06,880
the blueberry cookie structure very well

1303
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:08,318
supported

1304
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:10,079
very stout some of the others are a

1305
00:40:08,318 --> 00:40:12,239
little skinny a little wispy definitely

1306
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:13,599
need support the blueberry cookies

1307
00:40:12,239 --> 00:40:15,759
dominant structure

1308
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:16,800
will support itself very very sturdy

1309
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,880
very stout

1310
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,240
so it's got that stout structure which

1311
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,680
you're looking for you want plants that

1312
00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:23,118
will hold themselves up

1313
00:40:21,679 --> 00:40:24,719
they could build great big buds on

1314
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:26,800
themselves that's what we want takes

1315
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:28,959
popping and twisting very well

1316
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:31,200
then it's got that jack the ripper

1317
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,720
rotten mango flavor to it almost

1318
00:40:31,199 --> 00:40:34,399
and when i say this flavor people

1319
00:40:32,719 --> 00:40:34,959
wrinkle up their noses and they cringe

1320
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,039
but

1321
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:39,039
it smells like a bar trash can a little

1322
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:40,719
bit of fermented funk and vomit

1323
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:42,639
along with a little bit of rotten mango

1324
00:40:40,719 --> 00:40:44,318

i'm after

1339
00:41:10,159 --> 00:41:13,598
a lot of times people want to talk about

1340
00:41:11,838 --> 00:41:15,440
phenotypes and like what phenotype is

1341
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:18,318
this what is this called

1342
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:19,838

telling you which one i like but i want

1344
00:41:19,838 --> 00:41:22,799
you to grow this and find the phenotype

1345
00:41:21,358 --> 00:41:25,519
that blows your mind

1346
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:27,359
who cares if that girl makes me happy

1347

1348
00:41:27,358 --> 00:41:29,598
makes

1349
00:41:27,838 --> 00:41:31,119
find that blueberry butcher that makes

1350
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:32,640
you happy find the jack the ripper

1351
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:34,318

00:41:32,639 --> 00:41:35,838
find the one that is for you but that is

1353
00:41:34,318 --> 00:41:37,199
the phenotype i really love the

1354
00:41:35,838 --> 00:41:38,719
blueberry butcher

1355
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:40,960
it's got the structure of the blueberry

1356
00:41:38,719 --> 00:41:43,199
cookies it's got the potency

1357
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:45,119
uh the blueberry cookies is kinda it'll

1358
00:41:43,199 --> 00:41:46,639
put you down it'll make you think weird

1359
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:48,240
but then the jack the ripper comes in

1360
00:41:46,639 --> 00:41:49,759
and adds to that and it just [ __ ]

1361
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:50,879
lifts your head up it pulls the rug out

1362
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:52,240
from underneath you and you're like

1363
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:54,000
where are my keys

1364
00:41:52,239 --> 00:41:55,439
and you're like they're in your hand bro

1365
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,960
you're like oh all right where do we

1366
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:58,559
park and you're like you're parked bro

1367
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:00,639
and it's one of those kind of things

1368
00:41:58,559 --> 00:42:02,880
i really love it so there's another

1369
00:42:00,639 --> 00:42:03,838
phenotype that is not as common but does

1370
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:06,640
pop up

1371
00:42:03,838 --> 00:42:07,440
this one is purple it's the purple

1372
00:42:06,639 --> 00:42:10,799
butcher

1373
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:12,800
um it's not as potent in my opinion it

1374
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:14,400
doesn't have that psychedelia to it

1375
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,079
it's more sedative it'll lay you the

1376
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:18,559
[ __ ] down it finishes

1377
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:20,400
super early it's a shorter plant it's a

1378
00:42:18,559 --> 00:42:23,039
squattier bushier plant

1379
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:25,358
it's really easy to find early on in the

1380
00:42:23,039 --> 00:42:27,679
cycle when you see those big fat leaves

1381
00:42:25,358 --> 00:42:29,358
and the plant that doesn't grow tall the

1382
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:31,039
others will take off on you they'll get

1383
00:42:29,358 --> 00:42:32,960
almost a fishing pole thing if you don't

1384
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:35,920
have enough light they'll get tall

1385
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:36,880
if it's short squatty and makes up at

1386
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:39,440
the nodes

1387
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:41,358
where the nodes meet the branch it has

1388
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,960
like a little extra

1389
00:42:41,358 --> 00:42:45,279
i don't even know what to call it not

1390
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:46,880
webbing but a little extra callous

1391
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:48,240
looking spot somebody will tell me what

1392
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,599
that technical term is now that i've

1393
00:42:48,239 --> 00:42:50,479
mentioned that i don't know what that's

1394
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:51,838
called

1395
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,199
it looks like instead of the branches

1396
00:42:51,838 --> 00:42:55,119
just coming out they've got a little

1397
00:42:53,199 --> 00:42:56,078
extra suction making them a little more

1398
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:57,760
sturdy

1399
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:59,760
a lot of those phenotypes will end up

1400
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:01,440
being the shortier squat phenotype that

1401
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:04,800
makes purple buds

1402
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:08,079
those purple buds ah they smell like uh

1403
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:11,119
lavender and lemons and those have that

1404
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:13,760
chewable vitamin and dirty feet

1405
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:14,480
and elderberries is it elderberries that

1406
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,240
may be

1407
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:18,000
there's an aroma that i'm thinking of an

1408
00:43:16,239 --> 00:43:19,919
older vitamin from the health food store

1409
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,838
yeah dude it's elderberries

1410
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:23,440
yep it's elderberries and something else

1411
00:43:21,838 --> 00:43:25,199
purple from the health food store

1412
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,480
and those chewable [ __ ] vitamins

1413
00:43:25,199 --> 00:43:29,039
that's what it smells like i can taste

1414
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:32,559
it and smell it in my mouth right now

1415
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:35,759
ah lavender lilacs elderberries um

1416
00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:37,440
elderberry tea with honey in it yep

1417
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:39,359
and flintstones vitamins that's a purple

1418
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:40,639
phenotype so

1419
00:43:39,358 --> 00:43:42,559
those are the phenotypes there's the

1420
00:43:40,639 --> 00:43:44,159
blueberry cookies phenotype that tastes

1421
00:43:42,559 --> 00:43:44,880
like blue skittles it's got the whiter

1422
00:43:44,159 --> 00:43:47,199
leaves

1423
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:49,119
uh it's kind of got that tahoe going on

1424
00:43:47,199 --> 00:43:51,279
uh there's the jackhair phenotype it's

1425
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:53,358
hazy sandalwood skunk

1426
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:55,040
that's gonna be a long finisher the jack

1427
00:43:53,358 --> 00:43:56,318
the ripper phenotype will be kind of a

1428
00:43:55,039 --> 00:43:58,000
quick finisher

1429
00:43:56,318 --> 00:43:59,759
not as long as that jack hair finisher

1430
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,838
that's lemons and rotten fruit

1431
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:03,520
then we got the blueberry butcher that

1432
00:44:01,838 --> 00:44:04,559
is the blue cookie structure with that

1433
00:44:03,519 --> 00:44:07,759
mango

1434
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:09,279
the wango tango lemon lime red bull and

1435
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:10,079
vitamin sort of flavor then there's that

1436
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:12,160
purple one

1437
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:13,839
which in my opinion isn't the desirable

1438
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:15,199
phenotype but it will pop up

1439
00:44:13,838 --> 00:44:17,279
if you got the clientele that's into

1440
00:44:15,199 --> 00:44:18,159
purple this one will pay the bills for

1441
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:20,160
you there

1442
00:44:18,159 --> 00:44:22,078
um all of the phenotypes i recommend you

1443
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:23,598
top them you'll see where to top them

1444
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:26,000
if you're not good at topping plants

1445
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:27,760
this plant will tell you top me here

1446
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,358
it'll make a nice bottom and the one

1447
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,319
will just shoot up right out of the top

1448
00:44:29,358 --> 00:44:31,519
and you'll go that's the [ __ ] thing

1449
00:44:30,318 --> 00:44:32,960
that needs to come out

1450
00:44:31,519 --> 00:44:34,719
follow it down until it looks like you

1451
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:36,880
got a nice even canopy and take that

1452
00:44:34,719 --> 00:44:38,639
[ __ ] right out of there clone that top

1453
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:40,000
because they make beautiful clothes this

1454
00:44:38,639 --> 00:44:42,639
plant clones

1455
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:44,079
very very easily some of it uh some of

1456
00:44:42,639 --> 00:44:45,920
its assets and features

1457
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:48,240
attributes will give you a headache that

1458
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:50,720
cloning part simple as [ __ ] it'll clone

1459
00:44:48,239 --> 00:44:53,279
so easily for you um

1460
00:44:50,719 --> 00:44:55,679
expect around 70 days finishing time

1461
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:57,680
some people told me they went 82 days

1462
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:59,039
some people said they did 65 and really

1463
00:44:57,679 --> 00:45:01,919
wish they had gone longer

1464
00:44:59,039 --> 00:45:02,960
so let it go 70 72 days check those

1465
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:05,358
trichomes it is

1466
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:06,159
all about the trichomes as a breeder i'm

1467
00:45:05,358 --> 00:45:09,358
going to say

1468
00:45:06,159 --> 00:45:11,440
some people went 82 days so

1469
00:45:09,358 --> 00:45:12,799
there are 80 day phenotypes in these

1470
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,760
packs of seeds you guys i'm not going to

1471
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,920
[ __ ] you

1472
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:17,040
the blueberry butcher can go up to 82

1473
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:20,159
days but

1474
00:45:17,039 --> 00:45:20,719
it puts out giant harvest weights people

1475
00:45:20,159 --> 00:45:22,399
were

1476
00:45:20,719 --> 00:45:23,838
bragging about how much they pulled off

1477
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:26,000
their test plants

1478
00:45:23,838 --> 00:45:27,358
so the test plants were banging out

1479
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:30,159
produce production

1480
00:45:27,358 --> 00:45:30,719
usable weight profitable weight also it

1481
00:45:30,159 --> 00:45:33,279
is

1482
00:45:30,719 --> 00:45:34,639
highly potent ah i said potent my voice

1483
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:36,880
cut out there sorry let me take another

1484
00:45:34,639 --> 00:45:36,879
drink

1485
00:45:39,358 --> 00:45:42,639
