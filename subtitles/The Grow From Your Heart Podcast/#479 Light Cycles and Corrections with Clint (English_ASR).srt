19
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:08,010
clean pipe right now so everything

20
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:10,560
tastes a lot better through that I love

21
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:12,390
a nice fresh clean pipe my rig needs a

22
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,829
cleaning I might concentrate probably

23
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:16,259
would taste better how to clean that so

24
00:01:13,829 --> 00:01:20,039
a good job on the clean pipe did did you

25
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:27,569

close friend okay thank you very much

27
00:01:27,569 --> 00:01:30,868
sir for sure we like to start the

28
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:32,250
podcast off by talking about what we're

29
00:01:30,868 --> 00:01:34,469
smoking I usually talk about what I'm

30
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:36,599
smoking today I am smoking something

31
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:37,978
that I think tastes quite divine this is

32
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:39,629
the peach Recker

33
00:01:37,978 --> 00:01:41,640
I've got a combo I've got the full

34
00:01:39,629 --> 00:01:44,099
spectrum extract and I've also got the

35
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:46,170
live batter peach record full spectrum

36
00:01:44,099 --> 00:01:49,289
extract and live batter from Green Dot

37
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:52,019
labs this is a blend of de wrecker and

38
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:55,649
peach oz on the package the flavor is

39
00:01:52,019 --> 00:01:57,449
described as peach honey and gas when I

40
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:59,939
dad when I open it the first thing you

41
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:02,759
get is peach it is kind of like a fuzzy

42
00:01:59,938 --> 00:02:04,408
navel this is how the flavor then when

43
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:06,420
you hit it that peach flavor hits you

44
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:08,610
first it's more like a white grape kind

45
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:10,378
of a peach thing like a generic peach

46
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:11,640
juice a fake peach juice you get at the

47
00:02:10,378 --> 00:02:14,039
grocery store like a carton

48
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:15,268
it's got that peach juice flavor and

49
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:16,620
not dissing the flavor I'm just saying

50
00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:19,709
that's the version of peach did I get

51
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:21,299
from it ah nice then on the exhale the

52
00:02:19,709 --> 00:02:22,950
honey comes in I feel the honey on my

53
00:02:21,299 --> 00:02:24,718
tongue it gets sweet and soft on my

54
00:02:22,949 --> 00:02:26,009
tongue and that honey comes in on the

55
00:02:24,718 --> 00:02:28,318
exhale and it just chills there and I

56
00:02:26,009 --> 00:02:30,149
was really digging that the gas is there

57
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:30,589
but not as much as the peach and the

58
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,239
honey

59
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:35,700
yeah and it was definitely delicious so

60
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:37,739
I took a little glob of the the live

61
00:02:35,699 --> 00:02:39,658
batter and got enough of that on the

62
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:41,459
dabber to work as a little bit of a

63
00:02:39,658 --> 00:02:43,408
paste and then I stuck a giant full

64
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:44,670
spectrum extract diamond into that and

65
00:02:43,408 --> 00:02:47,009
then I dip that in a little bit of the

66
00:02:44,669 --> 00:02:49,009
Terp sauce in here and obviously it's

67
00:02:47,009 --> 00:02:51,358

can you describe it at all so that

94
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:59,280
smells like right when the plants get

95
00:03:55,259 --> 00:04:00,628
into flowering like right like near the

96
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,219
end right before you're gonna harvest

97
00:04:00,628 --> 00:04:04,530
like when you give them that squeeze and

98
00:04:02,219 --> 00:04:06,090
it's like real floral still okay that's

99

what I smell all right and that's

100
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:09,000

cocktail cool fruit cooked but there's

126
00:05:12,598 --> 00:05:20,120

127
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:22,408
that I enjoy yeah there's like some Brut

128

this one has a huge crystal in it so

135
00:05:40,408 --> 00:05:44,038
that's pretty tight I already know what

136
00:05:41,968 --> 00:05:46,560
that is because of the huge crystal yeah

137
00:05:44,038 --> 00:05:51,149
it says headbang or so head finger and

138

142
00:05:56,699 --> 00:06:01,580
so that's gassy you get trashcan I just

143
00:05:58,978 --> 00:06:04,769
mashed potatoes in trashcan I got the

144
00:06:01,579 --> 00:06:06,240
trashcan for sure yeah it sounds like a

145
00:06:04,769 --> 00:06:08,339
terrible description but when you smell

146
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,718
cannabis that smells and concentrates

147
00:06:08,339 --> 00:06:11,429
that smell like a trash can for some

148
00:06:09,718 --> 00:06:13,800
reason it's really desirable

149
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:16,560
it's so weird what I'm attracted to what

150
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:18,629
I was looking for weed but the nose nose

151
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,430
I'm gonna take the nose I've done a

152
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:21,959
podcast called follow your nose because

153
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:24,150
I feel like your nose knows what your

154
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:26,668
body needs does this and this is going

155
00:06:24,149 --> 00:06:30,629
to be a really random question is there

156
00:06:26,668 --> 00:06:31,829
almost a sexual aroma to this like

157
00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:34,290
something they would all

158
00:06:31,829 --> 00:06:37,399
trigger a sexual pheromone in that smell

159
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:40,950
that earthy almost kind of an armpit ii

160
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:43,219
summary and I don't mean like summer by

161
00:06:40,949 --> 00:06:47,550
that I mean like somebody in the summer

162
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:49,470
smells like sex panther well Clint is a

163
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:51,480
part-time comedian so sex panther is

164
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:53,220

246
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:10,470
fan of comedy I like to laugh I think

247
00:10:09,299 --> 00:10:12,990
laughter is medicine

248
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:15,060
mmm smoked cannabis and get told a joke

249
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:17,250
and you'll forget you even got problems

250
00:10:15,059 --> 00:10:19,138
you'll just be too busy laughing and it

251
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,980
feels good it recharges your soul of

252
00:10:19,139 --> 00:10:22,049
course you got to deal with your

253
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:24,120
problems appropriately but sometimes you

254
00:10:22,049 --> 00:10:25,198
gotta just it helps the problems in your

255
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,190
mind a little bit did you hear that

256
00:10:25,198 --> 00:10:27,649

[Laughter]

259

260
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:37,560
good for you

261
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,208

tall guy not the

271
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:06,000
like I carry they tell you a lot but it

272
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,049
was mr. Greg Proops who if you listen

273
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,839
you know that's one of my favorite

274
00:11:07,049 --> 00:11:12,120
comedians it was so funny last night -

275
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,899
he kind of works as a very gracious host

276
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:15,688
of the show

277
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:18,328
he's got good hosting skills I there's

278
00:11:15,688 --> 00:11:20,730
also a comedian known as Jeff B Davis a

279
00:11:18,328 --> 00:11:22,198
younger guy who fits in very well with

280
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:23,850
the improv group he's got a lot of

281
00:11:22,198 --> 00:11:25,500
energy he brings a lot of energy and

282
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:27,750
creativity and movement to the group

283
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:29,698
yeah I really worked hard he did really

284
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:30,929
well and he's got to bring that younger

285
00:11:29,698 --> 00:11:32,309
energy I'm not saying the other guys are

286
00:11:30,929 --> 00:11:34,620
old cats but they're not spring chickens

287
00:11:32,309 --> 00:11:36,299
they're older dudes and so to have Jeff

288
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:38,519
be Davis bring that young energy is

289
00:11:36,299 --> 00:11:41,338

dry humor yeah he kind of has a Bob

296
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:57,949
Newhart sort of a delivery to it he

297
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:57,949

298
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:03,060

299
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:04,920
almost on stage just the smartass like

300
00:12:03,059 --> 00:12:07,198
if it got too funny he'd have one

301
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:08,549
comment just to shut you down yeah and

302
00:12:07,198 --> 00:12:10,979
you didn't say a lot

303
00:12:08,549 --> 00:12:13,078
it was just what he said yes correct

304
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:14,909
it's beautiful then there's another guy

305
00:12:13,078 --> 00:12:18,028
that some people may have heard of a guy

306
00:12:14,909 --> 00:12:19,169
named uh his name is Dave Foley Foley

307
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:21,059
Dave Foley

308
00:12:19,169 --> 00:12:23,129
he's [ __ ] hilarious that guy's got a

309
00:12:21,059 --> 00:12:27,750
lot of character yeah snazzy dresser

310
00:12:23,129 --> 00:12:29,938
yeah they were always pretty swell Greg

311
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:32,009
Proops his themes is how do we dress as

312
00:12:29,938 --> 00:12:34,289
sharp as possible and that's one of his

313
00:12:32,009 --> 00:12:36,240
mottos all the time so they've of course

314
00:12:34,289 --> 00:12:38,549
looked good and it would be rude to

315
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,139
overlook a very crucial member of the

316
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:42,058
group they have a musician whose name

317
00:12:40,139 --> 00:12:44,549
who has escaped my head right now

318
00:12:42,058 --> 00:12:46,049
but he brings a grand piano and a

319
00:12:44,549 --> 00:12:48,568
keyboard and a couple of other small

320
00:12:46,049 --> 00:12:50,578
instruments and he provides the musical

321
00:12:48,568 --> 00:12:53,009
soundtrack for the evening and without

322
00:12:50,578 --> 00:12:54,929
him it wouldn't be a show that guy is

323
00:12:53,009 --> 00:12:57,509
amazing he's a great musician they do

324
00:12:54,929 --> 00:13:00,239
improv songs he provides background

325
00:12:57,509 --> 00:13:01,079
music and sound effects and he is

326
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,058

336
00:13:19,169 --> 00:13:22,649
to do improv they've got to make it

just he made the show really he's doing

346
00:13:41,309 --> 00:13:45,000
the score and the sound effects at the

347
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:46,980
same time basically I remember they said

348
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,320
he was from Edmonton he's won a bunch of

349
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:50,730
awards for something a big thing in

350
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,080
Canada and I hate to be disrespectful

351
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:52,769
like that but he's definitely well-known

352
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:55,320
in Canada

353
00:13:52,769 --> 00:13:56,909
of course I was plenty stoned because we

354
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,410
were going to a funny comedy show the

355
00:13:56,909 --> 00:13:59,939
last thing I was thinking about was

356
00:13:58,409 --> 00:14:01,110
remembering people's names but he

357
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:03,810
deserves some acknowledgement he's a

358
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:05,879

00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:28,860
that we found and man he's telling this

449
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:32,009
story and some about baseball and also

450
00:17:28,859 --> 00:17:35,769
Jeff gets hit across the chest like like

451
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:38,528
a Ric Flair choppy that I was out

452
00:17:35,769 --> 00:17:41,480
anybody's in those proofs knows he's a

453
00:17:38,528 --> 00:17:43,369
baseball stories and so he's stoned we

454
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:45,500
got him lit yeah telling a story about

455
00:17:43,369 --> 00:17:47,268
baseball and he tagged me to express

456
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:49,250
that the runner was out and I was like

457
00:17:47,269 --> 00:17:53,690
oh he did I looked at Clint like proof

458
00:17:49,250 --> 00:18:01,298
just slap this step in like security

459
00:17:53,690 --> 00:18:03,950
guard I was with him for like 45 minutes

460
00:18:01,298 --> 00:18:06,230
I mean these always been such a

461
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:08,288
gentlemen in such a great host so

462
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:13,399
there's a great thing about that

463
00:18:08,288 --> 00:18:15,710
comedian personality there's a need for

464
00:18:13,398 --> 00:18:17,750
attention yeah and the thing that once

465
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:20,028
you've got an audience you don't want to

466
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:21,648
let it go yeah and so if we find him at

467
00:18:20,028 --> 00:18:23,929
the right time and they're still in that

468
00:18:21,648 --> 00:18:27,619
pocket they just keep going for us and

469
00:18:23,929 --> 00:18:30,440
when they see us in that Club knows who

470
00:18:27,619 --> 00:18:32,449
I am and so I may be given special

471
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:33,860
treatment and get special access to

472
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:35,389
people but once they meet us and they

473
00:18:33,859 --> 00:18:37,189
calm down and they start smoke and they

474
00:18:35,388 --> 00:18:39,829
realize these guys are harmless they're

475
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:44,679
not like sketchy fans they can ask us to

476
00:18:39,829 --> 00:18:47,269
sign their ass sheets and not even over

477
00:18:44,679 --> 00:18:49,309
eight times recently there's no photos

478
00:18:47,269 --> 00:18:51,169
anywhere of it because it's no need for

479
00:18:49,308 --> 00:18:53,690
that well you get to certain like

480
00:18:51,169 --> 00:18:55,909
mentality and you just realize like dude

481
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:57,200
I'm enjoying this for this moment right

482
00:18:55,909 --> 00:19:02,240
now it's in my brain I know what

483
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:03,980
happened so I kind of got when we meet

484
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,388
these people once you get them going you

485
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:07,069
smoke a bowl with number two and then

486
00:19:05,388 --> 00:19:08,209
you don't get weird on them and they get

tell you the truth you know so when we

528

go to meet these famous people I know

529
00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:30,240
how to be comfortable and make a

530
00:20:28,169 --> 00:20:33,240
conversation happen and be casual and

531
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,890
you generally stand a little bit to the

532
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,720
back and let the conversation go and you

533
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:37,410
talk when it's necessary and let me run

534
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,779
my face

535
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:41,759
Joey decided you said I'm a stand-up

536
00:20:39,779 --> 00:20:49,740
comedian and Joey was like oh yeah [ __ ]

537
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:51,569
this guy with dreadlocks like I just

538
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:53,250
stood back and let you and I watched you

539
00:20:51,569 --> 00:20:55,589
and Joey Diaz have a conversation

540
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:57,569
there's a light right between you guys

541
00:20:55,589 --> 00:20:59,428
just shine on both of your faces and I

542
00:20:57,569 --> 00:21:01,259
just stood back I had a health stone

543
00:20:59,429 --> 00:21:03,030
pipe with hash in it and I just sat

544
00:21:01,259 --> 00:21:04,919
there and hit a ball a couple of times I

545
00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:06,839
just chill that and watch Joey tell you

546
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:09,630
he laid it down but I remember I told

547
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:12,178
you they write every day and he I don't

548
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:13,530
know what's right every day I don't care

549
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:15,210
write your name across the page a

550
00:21:13,529 --> 00:21:18,230
thousand times don't spin it I'll write

551
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:20,910
in every [ __ ] day [ __ ] yeah I

552
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:22,558
think that's part of the key but yeah

553
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:24,058
just to get those magical moments and to

554
00:21:22,558 --> 00:21:25,678
watch him tell you that and it's the sit

555
00:21:24,058 --> 00:21:28,019
back was kind of cool I wish I would

556
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:32,519
have had the balls to take out my phone

557
00:21:28,019 --> 00:21:33,359
and snap a shot for you but yes the best

558
00:21:32,519 --> 00:21:34,740
place you would have made it

559
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:36,779
uncomfortable would have broken all of

560
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:38,220
the magic I think the phone would have

561
00:21:36,779 --> 00:21:40,428
ruined all of the magic at that yeah I

562
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:42,539
felt like we kind of just had like uh I

563
00:21:40,429 --> 00:21:46,200

564
00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:48,149
like it's just like dude we're just

565
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,830

00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:50,110
the normal price for it I'm not gonna

649
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,460
say they gave me any special deal but

650
00:24:50,109 --> 00:24:53,079
they reached out and said we want the

651
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:55,779
Colorado boy are you ready to do it

652
00:24:53,079 --> 00:24:57,279
yes I am I've got a fool ten-by-ten

653
00:24:55,779 --> 00:24:59,049
booth I got the booth ready to go

654
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:00,700
there'd be a lot of great things

655
00:24:59,049 --> 00:25:02,319
available at the booth so yeah that's

656
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:03,819
that's my commercial for that come say

657
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:05,289
what's up yeah definitely come say

658
00:25:03,819 --> 00:25:07,029
what's up I'm the tall white guy with

659
00:25:05,289 --> 00:25:08,680
dreadlocks at the IRA genetics booth I'm

660
00:25:07,029 --> 00:25:10,359
trying to get white mic to be able to

661
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:11,950
attend he does have two children and a

662
00:25:10,359 --> 00:25:15,899
family and a lot of things going on that

663
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:21,130
time of year so 25th and 26th of January

664
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:23,820
Expo all right let's get a little more

665
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:26,740
serious because in a previous episode I

666
00:25:23,819 --> 00:25:29,619
may have said something that was not a

667
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:32,410
hundred percent accurate I wasn't a huge

668
00:25:29,619 --> 00:25:34,059
mistake but it's good I like I don't

669
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:36,040
like making mistakes I like learning

670
00:25:34,059 --> 00:25:38,919
from my mistakes I like it I've got a

671
00:25:36,039 --> 00:25:40,930
really good community the irie are me

672
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:42,970
the girl from your heart crew not only

673
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:45,279
did they support us well on patreon but

674
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:47,860
also they reached out and politely said

675
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:49,839
hey you gave some kind of funky

676
00:25:47,859 --> 00:25:51,459
information on one of these episodes and

677
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:54,459
it wasn't a major mistake it's not gonna

678
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:56,920
kill anybody's plants honestly I will

679
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:59,410
admit that this is the area of growing

680
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:01,509
and cannabis where I can use the most

681
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:03,759
education and I am not afraid to admit

682
00:26:01,509 --> 00:26:06,129
that I know a lot about most of this is

683
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:08,440
lighting and light spectrums which is

684
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:10,570
something that I know very minimal about

685
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:12,309
I should know more I'm not ashamed to

686
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:14,859
admit that that's awesome I know about

687
00:26:12,309 --> 00:26:16,629
plants like a [ __ ] I know about

688
00:26:14,859 --> 00:26:17,709
breeding I know about selection I can

689
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:19,720
look at your plants and tell you what's

690
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:20,860
wrong with their nutrients like I can

691
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:22,600
tell you a lot of things when it comes

692
00:26:20,859 --> 00:26:24,399
to lighting I am a little ignorant I

693
00:26:22,599 --> 00:26:27,039
need to read more books on that and I'm

694
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:29,080
not shy to admit that but luckily I

695
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:30,369
something that indicated straight up I'm

696
00:26:29,079 --> 00:26:31,720
[ __ ] full of [ __ ] when it comes to

697
00:26:30,369 --> 00:26:33,519
talking about lighting because some of

698
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:35,620
our friends stepped up and said Rasta

699
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:37,509
Jeff first off you're a little bit wrong

700
00:26:35,619 --> 00:26:39,369
but then they helped me out and they

701
00:26:37,509 --> 00:26:41,049
said here's the information that you

702
00:26:39,369 --> 00:26:42,669
need so Big Shot it to all of my friends

703
00:26:41,049 --> 00:26:44,259
who helped me out when I started reading

704
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:46,269
this one of our friends will say haha he

705
00:26:44,259 --> 00:26:48,819
took my information so in a previous

706
00:26:46,269 --> 00:26:52,210
episode I kind of said that the Sun

707
00:26:48,819 --> 00:26:55,089
changes color as it sets and that that

708
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:56,890
color from the Sun creates a different

709
00:26:55,089 --> 00:26:57,699
spectrum that helps the plants go to

710
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:59,740
sleep yep

711
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:02,769
the plant does the Sun does not change

712
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:05,109
colors that's true that is true I

713
00:27:02,769 --> 00:27:06,369
honestly hadn't done I didn't write any

714
00:27:05,109 --> 00:27:07,929
notes for that I was reading that

715
00:27:06,369 --> 00:27:09,669
question and was just answering it from

716
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:11,620
my knowledge and I said that the Sun

717
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:13,269
changes colors it may look like it

718
00:27:11,619 --> 00:27:17,019
changes colors that is not what happens

719
00:27:13,269 --> 00:27:19,779
the atmosphere filters the light based

720
00:27:17,019 --> 00:27:23,109
on the angle of the Sun in a comparison

721
00:27:19,779 --> 00:27:24,910
to where we are seeing it so it doesn't

722
00:27:23,109 --> 00:27:27,339
change colors it's basically a filter

723
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:28,269
because imagine if you held a light bulb

724
00:27:27,339 --> 00:27:30,279
right above your head

725
00:27:28,269 --> 00:27:31,690
it's gonna see bright here and you're

726
00:27:30,279 --> 00:27:32,920
gonna get that other color of light down

727
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:34,210
here and then you'll move it it's gonna

728
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:36,279
the lights gonna shine differently

729
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:38,950
it's basically an atmosphere like if you

730
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:40,059
when it's foggy the [ __ ] light shines

731
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:41,650
differently because you can see it

732
00:27:40,059 --> 00:27:43,659
that's the type of [ __ ] is it's going to

733
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:45,820
change completely obviously you can tell

734
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:46,990
I don't understand that concept fully

735
00:27:45,819 --> 00:27:50,169
you can tell by the way I'm trying to

736
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:52,089
explain it in terms of light yes but

737
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:55,000
that happens because of the angle of the

738
00:27:52,089 --> 00:27:57,309
Sun where you are and the atmosphere it

739
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,319
filters the light so I just wanted to

740
00:27:57,309 --> 00:28:01,029
say I did that wrong and I am not afraid

741
00:27:59,319 --> 00:28:03,159
to admit it and thank you to my friend

742
00:28:01,029 --> 00:28:04,480
Jesse James for stepping up and

743
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,950
correcting me that means a lot to me

744
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:09,099
that I've got a team that will politely

745
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:10,509
say hey bro you sound dumb yeah yeah no

746
00:28:09,099 --> 00:28:12,039
I mean a lot of people are listening so

747
00:28:10,509 --> 00:28:13,660
we can't give out fake information no

748
00:28:12,039 --> 00:28:15,190
and you're willing to [ __ ] make your

749
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:16,750
mistakes and learn from them you know

750
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:18,370
I've done a podcast all about making

751
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:21,009
mistakes so there's another one for you

752
00:28:18,369 --> 00:28:22,479
yeah and also you guys I'm not [ __ ]

753
00:28:21,009 --> 00:28:24,129
bulletproof I [ __ ] up I said some dumb

754
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,029
[ __ ] and Here I am Sam I said some dumb

755
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:26,710
[ __ ] sorry you guys

756
00:28:25,029 --> 00:28:29,559
a lot of people rely on me you were

757
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:31,779
close you know and I I'm it's not a

758
00:28:29,559 --> 00:28:34,119
plant thing this is more of a-- and so

759
00:28:31,779 --> 00:28:36,519
we were talking about far red spectrums

760
00:28:34,119 --> 00:28:38,859
and this is a spectrum that falls in the

761
00:28:36,519 --> 00:28:40,639
seven to eight hundred nanometer range

762
00:28:38,859 --> 00:28:44,659
and there's a little bit of a debate

763
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:48,140
on the Internet on what range is ideal

764
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:51,200
for the far-red spectrum some people say

765
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:52,880
it is seven to eight hundred I saw 7:30

766
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:55,160
to eight hundred and then more

767
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:58,309
specifically people dial it in to the

768
00:28:55,160 --> 00:29:00,710
750 to 780 range but I'm also seeing

769
00:28:58,308 --> 00:29:03,410
people go up to 8:30 so there's a little

770
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:05,329
bit of a debate where that read happens

771
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:07,670
which is most ideal for the cannabis

772
00:29:05,329 --> 00:29:10,298
plant Julia just like all lighting

773
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:13,220
pretty much it's probably possibly

774
00:29:10,298 --> 00:29:15,500
phenotype dependent plant specific I'll

775
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:17,210
bet it is yeah yeah because I mean we're

776
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:20,240
where plants are from they're gonna want

777
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:21,919
light right northern southern oh man

778
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,539
yep that's gonna be all right so that

779
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:25,580
makes a big difference as to where your

780
00:29:23,539 --> 00:29:28,700
nanometers are gonna be absolutely I

781
00:29:25,579 --> 00:29:30,769
would agree with that all right so I

782
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:32,870
think I corrected that big thanks to

783
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:35,058
Jesse James for that and I apologize for

784
00:29:32,869 --> 00:29:37,899
kind of bleeding you guys astray yeah

785
00:29:35,058 --> 00:29:41,200
but here I am addressing my mistakes

786
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:44,419
also I said that I would not recommend

787
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:45,860
cutting clones directly into cocoa

788
00:29:44,419 --> 00:29:47,960
we had a listener saying that they were

789
00:29:45,859 --> 00:29:50,089
taking their clones into cocoa and their

790
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:52,700
clones were dying I said that's not a

791
00:29:50,089 --> 00:29:54,798
good idea I got several messages saying

792
00:29:52,700 --> 00:30:01,429
basically go [ __ ] yourself because I cut

793
00:29:54,798 --> 00:30:03,168
clones into cocoa so I believe you and

794
00:30:01,429 --> 00:30:04,880
I'm sure that it does work for you but

795
00:30:03,169 --> 00:30:06,860
for the listener who they were all dying

796
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,540
on yeah it obviously wasn't working and

797
00:30:06,859 --> 00:30:10,069
I recommended they go back to basics

798
00:30:08,539 --> 00:30:12,079
those people that it's working for

799
00:30:10,069 --> 00:30:13,879
that's radit you've probably got a lot

800
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:15,079
of experience and you know really well

801
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,850
what you're doing you've dialed it in

802
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:19,099
and you're not killing clones yeah we

803
00:30:16,849 --> 00:30:20,359
had a listener killing them so something

804
00:30:19,099 --> 00:30:22,609
wasn't working and when it's not working

805
00:30:20,359 --> 00:30:24,619
that's when I start going backwards and

806
00:30:22,609 --> 00:30:25,909
saying what's going on what's wrong when

807
00:30:24,619 --> 00:30:27,349
the engine doesn't work you got to take

808
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:29,090
it apart rebuild that [ __ ] and I was

809
00:30:27,349 --> 00:30:30,529
just trying to take it apart and start

810
00:30:29,089 --> 00:30:31,879
going back to the white belt level and

811
00:30:30,529 --> 00:30:33,230
then we'll work our way back up and

812
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:34,790
maybe when they're good again they

813
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:36,650
understand the basics of cloning we'll

814
00:30:34,789 --> 00:30:38,240
get them going back into cocoa but for

815
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:40,730
that person who wasn't working but I

816
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:42,710
can't say that no you cannot clone into

817
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:44,929
cocoa that's probably not the thing to

818
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:46,490
say it's probably not recommended for

819
00:30:44,929 --> 00:30:48,500
beginners and if you're having problems

820
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:50,029
doing it abandon that because you'll

821
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:52,789
have much more success with the cloning

822
00:30:50,029 --> 00:30:54,259
machine or probably easy cloner not easy

823
00:30:52,789 --> 00:30:56,569
to honor the rapid Rooter

824
00:30:54,259 --> 00:30:59,839
little plugs so you can clone into cocoa

825
00:30:56,569 --> 00:31:01,519
I apologize if I upset you by missing

826
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:03,769
your tech it does work but not for

827
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:05,359
everybody thank God it's yeah well

828
00:31:03,769 --> 00:31:06,920
people are just coming at me and I need

829
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:08,599
to be the corrections department

830
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:11,000
all right enough catching up let's move

831
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:13,009
on to something new what do we got the

832
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,470
next part is oh I got a really good

833
00:31:13,009 --> 00:31:17,299
question on YouTube and this one was a

834
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:20,390
question about how do you feel about

835
00:31:17,299 --> 00:31:21,470
eleven thirteen light schedules and then

836
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:24,470
I thought I could talk briefly about

837
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:26,569
that I'm an eleven thirteen flowering

838
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:28,370
schedule most of us do at twelve twelve

839
00:31:26,569 --> 00:31:29,779
that seems to be the traditional on off

840
00:31:28,369 --> 00:31:31,639
schedule twelve twelve makes your plants

841
00:31:29,779 --> 00:31:33,399
flower you leave them there for nine or

842
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:36,170
ten weeks and you get good buds

843
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:37,910
djay short a while back started

844
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:39,470
preaching about doing Oh DJ shorts the

845
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:42,290
one that made it popular for most people

846
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:44,809
DJ shorts started talking about doing 11

847
00:31:42,289 --> 00:31:48,409
hours on and 13 hours off and this has

848
00:31:44,809 --> 00:31:51,259
several benefits the first benefit is it

849
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:52,670
will show more phenotypic expression if

850
00:31:51,259 --> 00:31:55,009
you're drawing from seed you'll see more

851
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:56,150
variation in your different seedlings

852
00:31:55,009 --> 00:31:58,759
you'll see different phenotypic

853
00:31:56,150 --> 00:32:00,440
expressions more uh more expression I

854
00:31:58,759 --> 00:32:01,879
guess I can say you'll see yeah they'll

855
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:04,160
show their variance is a little bit more

856
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:06,800
because it's just getting less light

857
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:08,810
less light more more time to express I

858
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:10,309
guess more time to show what they say

859
00:32:08,809 --> 00:32:12,139
that kids grow in their sleep do the

860
00:32:10,309 --> 00:32:13,669
plants do the same thing they started if

861
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:15,740
you watch a video of a plant on a

862
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:17,029
time-lapse camera they don't do a lot

863
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:18,710
during the day they get blown around

864
00:32:17,029 --> 00:32:20,059
they try to stay there yeah at night

865
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:21,620
they look like they're swimming and they

866
00:32:20,059 --> 00:32:23,990
grow the leaves go up and leaves go down

867
00:32:21,619 --> 00:32:25,159
and leaves go up they go down it looks

868
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:26,569
like a jack you know what I mean like

869
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:28,250
when you move a jack you move the handle

870
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:30,889
down and Jack goes up let's say it looks

871
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:31,700
like the leaves are kind of swimming if

872
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:34,790
you watch them overnight

873
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:36,620
oh yes really neat to see really neat to

874
00:32:34,789 --> 00:32:38,089
see so they do most of their growth most

875
00:32:36,619 --> 00:32:39,589
of their production at nighttime right

876
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:41,689
and I've learned that if you give them

877
00:32:39,589 --> 00:32:44,089
that more that longer extended night

878
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:46,220
period you do see a little bit different

879
00:32:44,089 --> 00:32:49,069
you know typical expression it will also

880
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:51,410
in my opinion speed them up in their

881
00:32:49,069 --> 00:32:53,779
flowering time you may save up to a week

882
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:55,759
maybe ten days on some phenotypes if

883
00:32:53,779 --> 00:32:57,410
you've got a seventy day and you cut it

884
00:32:55,759 --> 00:32:59,509
down to eleven thirteen you may have a

885
00:32:57,410 --> 00:33:00,920
sixty five day or at this point yeah

886
00:32:59,509 --> 00:33:03,559
don't take my word for it that's gonna

887
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:05,539
be plant and phenotype dependent hundred

888
00:33:03,559 --> 00:33:06,919
percent but get your scope out start

889
00:33:05,539 --> 00:33:07,639
paying attention you may notice

890
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:10,220
different things

891
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:12,530
Brown now this get them brown that

892
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:15,140
sounds grosser than it should this is

893
00:33:12,529 --> 00:33:18,079
going to be plant and strain and

894
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:20,570
phenotype dependent on if this is best

895
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:22,609
for your plants or not if you want if

896
00:33:20,569 --> 00:33:24,109
you're running from seed in a small tent

897
00:33:22,609 --> 00:33:27,349
and you're just doing a phyno hunt i

898
00:33:24,109 --> 00:33:30,469
would go with the 1113 hmm this also has

899
00:33:27,349 --> 00:33:32,869
advantages in a large scale environment

900
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:35,660
imagine if you've got 24 lights and I

901
00:33:32,869 --> 00:33:37,899
cut off one hour a day over a month

902
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:41,120
you've got 30 days at 24 lights that's

903
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:42,860
720 hours of lighting that you're not

904
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:44,750
paying for which is also air

905
00:33:42,859 --> 00:33:46,490
conditioning you're not paying for so

906
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:48,769
those bulbs are also gonna last you that

907
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:50,720
hour longer so that just multiplies

908
00:33:48,769 --> 00:33:52,190
you've got if you're running 24 what I

909
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:54,799
don't even know the numbers I started

910
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:57,080
with it 24 lights right so 24 lights

911
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:58,460
yeah so it just scales up if you go more

912
00:33:57,079 --> 00:34:01,220
lights you save it more money

913
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:03,680
yeah so even just one hour but is that

914
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:05,779
pushing it Jeff like it just depends on

915
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:06,920
the strain I suppose you know if if

916
00:34:05,779 --> 00:34:08,570
you're doing the pheno hunt I would

917
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:10,250
recommend it like to start off with that

918
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:12,919
just to find the one because it's gonna

919
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:15,860
show you they're able to express their

920
00:34:12,918 --> 00:34:17,809
phenotypes more more fully I don't know

921
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:19,250
how else to say those words my god it's

922
00:34:17,809 --> 00:34:20,750
like yeah the tall ones are gonna get

923
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:23,119
taller the purple ones will show more

924
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:25,630
purple the stinky one will get stinky or

925
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:29,269
in my opinion in my experience okay yeah

926
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:31,039
that may do a little bit to your yields

927
00:34:29,269 --> 00:34:33,440
because we do say that light is the

928
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:35,029
number one source of energy and food for

929
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,380
the plant and you're cutting down an

930
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:39,380
hour of that mm-hmm

931
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:44,000
so that may show a small reduction in

932
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:45,890
yield and in harvest wait have you seen

933
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,320
a big difference in that not big enough

934
00:34:45,889 --> 00:34:52,129
to make it worth it no I would rather do

935
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:54,050
the 11 13 really lot of times yes I'm

936
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:56,329
really going to throw the world off

937
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:57,769
Clint I'm going to imagine that several

938
00:34:56,329 --> 00:34:59,269
people signed out of this episode

939
00:34:57,769 --> 00:35:00,860
because we were a little bit rambling at

940
00:34:59,269 --> 00:35:02,599
the beginning yeah they didn't think

941
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:04,670
they were gonna get this magical [ __ ]

942
00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:05,929
grow tip probably add some magic here's

943
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:07,450
a tip that I don't share with a lot of

944
00:35:05,929 --> 00:35:09,859
people that I don't talk about a lot

945
00:35:07,449 --> 00:35:13,069
this is something this is an advanced

946
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:16,070
tip at the end of flowering I change my

947
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:18,170
timer I used to preach

948
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:19,610
for people to reduce time if you've got

949
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:21,500
a plant that takes way too long to

950
00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:22,640
flower here's there's one piece of

951
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:24,349
advice and I'll share what I was gonna

952
00:35:22,639 --> 00:35:25,879
say after that if you've got a plant

953
00:35:24,349 --> 00:35:28,009
that takes too long to flower I'm going

954
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:29,780
to use lemon G as my example because

955
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:31,340
this works very well with lemon G if

956
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:33,590
you're growing lemon G or a lemon G

957
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:36,950
cross take note if you've got a cultivar

958
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:38,900
that takes 11 12 13 weeks this will work

959
00:35:36,949 --> 00:35:40,639
for you this will be very helpful if

960
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:42,710
that plant takes too long you need it to

961
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:45,109
hurry up you're running 12 12 or you're

962
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:48,170
running 11 13 toward the end of flower

963
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:50,120
you can reduce the amount of light hours

964
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:51,500
and that will make that plant speed up

965
00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:53,179
it does the same thing that happens

966
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:56,840
outdoors it makes the plan go oh [ __ ]

967
00:35:53,179 --> 00:35:58,519
falls no it's here do my [ __ ] yeah it's

968
00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:00,740
finishing up it can do all that

969
00:35:58,519 --> 00:36:02,239
processing at nighttime so it starts

970
00:36:00,739 --> 00:36:04,159
finishing up it starts speeding up that

971
00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:06,079
finishing process it starts hardening up

972
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:08,509
the trichomes start ripening up so you

973
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:10,610
can slowly reduce the amount of daylight

974
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:12,680
hours you can get down to 8 hours a day

975
00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:14,930
if you want to I just have 8 hours on

976
00:36:12,679 --> 00:36:16,429
and 16 hours off and let the plant

977
00:36:14,929 --> 00:36:17,329
finish like that for the last couple of

978
00:36:16,429 --> 00:36:19,429
weeks there you go

979
00:36:17,329 --> 00:36:20,989
quite often during flush I'll reduce so

980
00:36:19,429 --> 00:36:23,480
if I've got something lemon G I'll

981
00:36:20,989 --> 00:36:24,889
reduce the lights to 10 hours on for a

982
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:26,420
week and then I'll move them to eight

983
00:36:24,889 --> 00:36:28,819
hours on for a week and for the last

984
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:30,619
week I'll put them on for 6 hours on and

985
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:32,180
that plant will really finish up and I'm

986
00:36:30,619 --> 00:36:34,730
flushing through that time period also

987
00:36:32,179 --> 00:36:36,679
yeah flushing is free I'm saving a lot

988
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:38,449
of money on less lights it's really an

989
00:36:36,679 --> 00:36:41,269
economical way to help that plant finish

990
00:36:38,449 --> 00:36:43,849
up so you can reduce the amount of

991
00:36:41,269 --> 00:36:46,610
daylight hours to finish up a slower

992
00:36:43,849 --> 00:36:49,519
finishing cultivar is uh wood

993
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:51,410
temperature in the room do anything for

994
00:36:49,519 --> 00:36:52,940
that - like wood dropping the

995
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:54,949
temperature make things speed up a

996
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:56,659
little bit a little bit colder will help

997
00:36:54,949 --> 00:36:58,099
you but you can't have too large of a

998
00:36:56,659 --> 00:37:00,049
swing because that's when you start

999
00:36:58,099 --> 00:37:02,179
promoting powdery mildew but if you

1000
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:04,160
overall lower your daytime and nighttime

1001
00:37:02,179 --> 00:37:06,440
temperature slowly and keep your vapor

1002
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:08,029
pressure deficit in line that is

1003
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:09,740
something that you can do that'll bring

1004
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:11,210
out purples that'll bring out density

1005
00:37:09,739 --> 00:37:12,769
and that'll also bring out some flavors

1006
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:14,389
and some colors yeah I'll think about

1007
00:37:12,769 --> 00:37:16,099
outside when it starts getting cold we

1008
00:37:14,389 --> 00:37:17,690
start seeing those beautiful fall colors

1009
00:37:16,099 --> 00:37:19,309
that'll happen indoors with the

1010
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:21,349
temperature and the slight adjustment as

1011
00:37:19,309 --> 00:37:22,909
well right on if you're doing the 1113

1012
00:37:21,349 --> 00:37:24,589
and then you start dropping the lights

1013
00:37:22,909 --> 00:37:26,210
down you're really gonna see that fall

1014
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:29,090
change in your plants so when you get

1015
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:29,480
some really cool photos yo the photos

1016
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:32,630
come

1017
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:35,659
excellent man you share some rad stuff

1018
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:37,190
on your Instagram you've got some good

1019
00:37:35,659 --> 00:37:38,809
friends growing some good wheat it

1020
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:41,119
sounds like I have refrained from

1021
00:37:38,809 --> 00:37:43,309
posting a lot of my own photos because

1022
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:45,769
if the breeder can breed a strain and

1023
00:37:43,309 --> 00:37:48,920
grow it to perfection good job high five

1024
00:37:45,769 --> 00:37:50,659
if I can breed seeds and get them to a

1025
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:52,490
friend who grows in a completely

1026
00:37:50,659 --> 00:37:55,069
different style than me and obey can

1027
00:37:52,489 --> 00:37:56,509
grow them to perfection and snapshots of

1028
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:58,130
it that's when you know you've got a

1029
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:59,450
winning seed and a winning plant right

1030
00:37:58,130 --> 00:38:01,608
there if the breeder can do it that's

1031
00:37:59,449 --> 00:38:03,588
expected that's [ __ ] required that's

1032
00:38:01,608 --> 00:38:05,389
like if Metallica plays inter Sandman

1033
00:38:03,588 --> 00:38:07,670
they better get it right if we went up

1034
00:38:05,389 --> 00:38:10,989
there and played under Sandman that's

1035
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:13,730
gonna [ __ ] go yeah yeah for sure yeah

1036
00:38:10,989 --> 00:38:16,429
so when it comes well it's like all

1037
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:18,409
right yeah yes here's what I want to

1038
00:38:16,429 --> 00:38:20,179
share here's what I want people to see

1039
00:38:18,409 --> 00:38:21,500
is that they can do this to you so I've

1040
00:38:20,179 --> 00:38:23,358
been sharing a lot of other people's and

1041
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:24,710
thanks for noticing that I they've been

1042
00:38:23,358 --> 00:38:26,569
doing a really good job for me lately

1043
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:27,800
dude you had some good friends yeah I've

1044
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:29,539
got some people out there running

1045
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:30,260
testers of stuff they don't even know

1046
00:38:29,539 --> 00:38:32,358
what it is

1047
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:33,980
and they are killing it yeah yeah

1048
00:38:32,358 --> 00:38:36,230
because I don't want them to treat the

1049
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:37,760
plant in any specific way because oh

1050
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:39,920
it's got this in it or it's this or I

1051
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:41,750
suspect it's this I just say this is

1052
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,800
some some seeds these are seeds they're

1053
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:44,869
feminized so you don't have to worry

1054
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,430
about boys oh these grow them let me

1055

1056
00:38:46,429 --> 00:38:48,980
good pictures document that [ __ ] and

1057
00:38:48,019 --> 00:38:51,800
they don't know what they've got and

1058
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:53,599
they send stellar photos yeah yeah good

1059
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:58,460
job my sisters thank you guys you've got

1060
00:38:53,599 --> 00:39:01,910
such amazing real grip like products

1061
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:04,039
though yeah really well I know yeah dude

1062
00:39:01,909 --> 00:39:06,618
there are I don't want to I don't even

1063
00:39:04,039 --> 00:39:08,059
want to brag because it just depends on

1064
00:39:06,619 --> 00:39:10,160
when you catch me how much packaging

1065
00:39:08,059 --> 00:39:11,809
time I've had like I've had time to sit

1066
00:39:10,159 --> 00:39:13,338
here and just stuff seeds into packages

1067
00:39:11,809 --> 00:39:14,809
and like find the right seeds for the

1068
00:39:13,338 --> 00:39:16,578
right packages and count them out get

1069
00:39:14,809 --> 00:39:20,119
them going I've got a lot of lines

1070
00:39:16,579 --> 00:39:22,700
available package them all up so I feel

1071
00:39:20,119 --> 00:39:28,369
that yeah I was looking at there's a

1072
00:39:22,699 --> 00:39:29,989
grip of lemon Geoffrey seeds there might

1073
00:39:28,369 --> 00:39:33,200
be a few packs of lemon Geoffrey those

1074
00:39:29,989 --> 00:39:35,000
may or may not be for an exponent coming

1075
00:39:33,199 --> 00:39:36,828
up in January it might be gonna start

1076
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,260
packing up early I'm trying to have you

1077
00:39:36,829 --> 00:39:41,780
know there might be a limited supply of

1078
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:42,410
those stashed for Indo Expo that's tight

1079
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:44,390
means

1080
00:39:42,409 --> 00:39:46,759
exciting let's move on to this lighting

1081
00:39:44,389 --> 00:39:48,650
thing because IT wheaties the world we

1082
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:49,910
may have cut out once already and then I

1083
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:51,530
tease that we're gonna give them a

1084
00:39:49,909 --> 00:39:53,058
secret tip that I don't share a lot and

1085
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:55,130
we talked about others should I love

1086
00:39:53,059 --> 00:39:57,048
that you keep kept that T's going for a

1087
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:58,789
while here is something I don't teach a

1088
00:39:57,048 --> 00:40:00,230
lot this is a really advanced trick this

1089
00:39:58,789 --> 00:40:02,000
is going to scare the [ __ ] out of a lot

1090
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:03,710
of people this is gonna be controversial

1091
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,849
I'm really glad that this game at the

1092
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:06,588
end of this episode this is like a

1093
00:40:04,849 --> 00:40:08,269
golden nugget this is like this is go

1094
00:40:06,588 --> 00:40:09,858
the prize at the bottom of the [ __ ]

1095
00:40:08,269 --> 00:40:11,179
cereal that you want your parents will

1096
00:40:09,858 --> 00:40:12,440
let you dig for you gotta eat the cereal

1097
00:40:11,179 --> 00:40:15,469
before you get to it here's the prize

1098
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:19,849
boys and girls um something that I find

1099
00:40:15,469 --> 00:40:22,098
very useful if I run a 12 12 or an 11 13

1100
00:40:19,849 --> 00:40:24,650
light cycle toward the end of flour

1101
00:40:22,099 --> 00:40:26,990
basically the day I begin flushing this

1102
00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:27,530
is probably ten days before I harvest

1103
00:40:26,989 --> 00:40:31,608
the plant

1104
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:34,819
I will put my timer back on an 18 6

1105
00:40:31,608 --> 00:40:37,788
light cycle yes I will repeat that at

1106
00:40:34,818 --> 00:40:41,929
the very end of my flowering phase I

1107
00:40:37,789 --> 00:40:44,480
return my timer to an 18-6 light cycle

1108
00:40:41,929 --> 00:40:48,288
to wear my flowering plants receive 18

1109
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:51,949
hours of daylight per day and 6 hours of

1110
00:40:48,289 --> 00:40:53,960
night cycle per day my flowering plants

1111
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:55,969
now people are going what the [ __ ] are

1112
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:58,608
you doing Rasta Jeff because I see Clint

1113
00:40:55,969 --> 00:40:59,689
kind of stroking his beard guys a lot of

1114
00:40:58,608 --> 00:41:02,058
splainin to do

1115
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:03,858
oh man you throw them back and get them

1116
00:41:02,059 --> 00:41:06,079
grow and again it makes them grow it

1117
00:41:03,858 --> 00:41:07,548
makes them beef up and people are gonna

1118
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:09,619
say won't that make your plants herm

1119
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:11,719
isn't that gonna cause problems we've

1120
00:41:09,619 --> 00:41:14,119
got 10 days yeah 10 days or two weeks

1121
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:16,429
and we're flushing you're flushing you

1122
00:41:14,119 --> 00:41:18,349
flip the light back on I said earlier

1123
00:41:16,429 --> 00:41:20,058
that light is the number one source of

1124
00:41:18,349 --> 00:41:22,068
food and energy for our plants

1125
00:41:20,059 --> 00:41:24,260
let's beef it up it will actually make

1126
00:41:22,068 --> 00:41:26,449
those buds swell up a lot of times a

1127
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:28,609
good cultivar will beef up on the last

1128
00:41:26,449 --> 00:41:31,009
couple of weeks of flower imagine if

1129
00:41:28,608 --> 00:41:33,440
that beefy [ __ ] gets extra energy at

1130
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:35,210
that last ten days the sons do that's

1131
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:37,309
what the son would do so they really

1132
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:38,720
swell up on you and people are gonna go

1133
00:41:37,309 --> 00:41:40,880
but they're gonna revenge or they're

1134
00:41:38,719 --> 00:41:45,019
gonna herm know you've only got 10 days

1135
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:46,608
yeah even if they do her then you might

1136
00:41:45,019 --> 00:41:48,469
get a nanner but nothing's gonna happen

1137
00:41:46,608 --> 00:41:49,909
because that nanner will be sterile and

1138
00:41:48,469 --> 00:41:51,679
there's no time for anything to

1139
00:41:49,909 --> 00:41:54,199
pollinate even if it does drop pollen

1140
00:41:51,679 --> 00:41:56,169
there are no viable parts of the plant

1141
00:41:54,199 --> 00:41:58,539
that can receive pollen we are way past

1142
00:41:56,170 --> 00:41:59,920
that this plant is basically it's one of

1143
00:41:58,539 --> 00:42:01,838
the golden girls now bro it's not gonna

1144
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:04,269
get pregnant on you it's too late for

1145
00:42:01,838 --> 00:42:06,279
that that's awesome yeah yeah

1146
00:42:04,269 --> 00:42:08,170
the plant is done at this point so it's

1147
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:09,730
working on its end phases of life it's

1148
00:42:08,170 --> 00:42:11,829
not gonna get pollinated it's not going

1149
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:14,260
to toss any pollen and it's just gonna

1150
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:15,880
beef up and it may begin to revenge if

1151
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:19,569
you let it go for too long but that's

1152
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:21,548
gonna take you 14 15 17 days before you

1153
00:42:19,568 --> 00:42:22,630
see any signs of reef edge and you'll

1154
00:42:21,548 --> 00:42:24,009
know what that looks like if you're

1155
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:25,269
familiar with your cultivar it'll look

1156
00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:27,640
like you just kind of Fox tailed a

1157
00:42:25,269 --> 00:42:29,559
little bit too much so that is something

1158
00:42:27,639 --> 00:42:31,539
you can try if you want to add a little

1159
00:42:29,559 --> 00:42:33,548
bit of beef a little bit of bulk if you

1160
00:42:31,539 --> 00:42:36,190
feel like you lost a little bit of beef

1161
00:42:33,548 --> 00:42:37,179
because you did the 11:13 at the end for

1162
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:38,950
the last seven days

1163
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:40,629
throw them [ __ ] back on eleven

1164
00:42:38,949 --> 00:42:42,608
thirteen this is something I would

1165
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:44,108
recommend experimenting with don't start

1166
00:42:42,608 --> 00:42:46,328
right away by doing it for ten days

1167
00:42:44,108 --> 00:42:49,298
maybe do it for five days and see what

1168
00:42:46,329 --> 00:42:51,519
happens yeah then the next crop do it

1169
00:42:49,298 --> 00:42:53,530
for ten days and see what happens then

1170
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:55,568
maybe extend it up to fourteen I

1171
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:57,339
wouldn't go past fourteen days

1172
00:42:55,568 --> 00:42:59,338
now I have made other recommendations

1173
00:42:57,338 --> 00:43:01,989
for other light cycles that is basically

1174
00:42:59,338 --> 00:43:03,578
around my breeding programs I dunno

1175
00:43:01,989 --> 00:43:05,858
other things and other methods and other

1176
00:43:03,579 --> 00:43:07,869
schedules that I do when breeding we may

1177
00:43:05,858 --> 00:43:10,269
talk about that in a future episode but

1178
00:43:07,869 --> 00:43:12,250
if you want to get crazy if you want to

1179
00:43:10,269 --> 00:43:12,548
try something new turn those lights back

1180
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:14,980
on

1181
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:16,989
to eighteen hours on and six hours off

1182
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:19,240
at the end of your flowering cycle as

1183
00:43:16,989 --> 00:43:21,489
you flush your plants and see if they

1184
00:43:19,239 --> 00:43:23,048
bulk up and beef up more than they have

1185
00:43:21,489 --> 00:43:25,269
in the past that is a golden nugget

1186
00:43:23,048 --> 00:43:27,608
right there yeah don't they listen to

1187
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:29,530
that long I'm sure we'll get a couple

1188
00:43:27,608 --> 00:43:31,269
we'll see what the emails say Yeah right

1189
00:43:29,530 --> 00:43:33,190
