67
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:33,598
gorilla grower a lot of tricks uh thank

68
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:35,640

69
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:37,679
watching now let's talk about this

70
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:39,719
question the question here is how can I

71
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,700
access the descriptions to your strains

72
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:43,519
which are available on iridirect that's

73
00:02:41,699 --> 00:02:45,780
a really good question if you go to

74
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,700
iridirect.com to buy seeds you'll notice

75
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:49,860
there are not a lot of photos there are

76
00:02:47,699 --> 00:02:51,959
not a lot of descriptions there I cannot

77
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:53,580
put those photos and descriptions on the

78
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:55,860
sales page that accepts a credit card

79
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:57,959
the credit card processors do not like

80
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:00,000
too many details there they just want it

81
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:02,039
to say a strain name and some seeds and

82
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,598
if it's rag or fam and a price is

83
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:06,799
basically all the info they want up

84
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:09,299
there on the page I do have another page

85
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,519
iregenetics.com is my main website where

86
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:13,500
everything is hosted the Discord is

87
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,599
there the podcast is there

88
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,878
links to all of the strain descriptions

89
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:20,759
are there on that website so you can go

90
00:03:17,878 --> 00:03:22,739
to iregenetics.com click on genetics

91
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:24,658
it'll take you to regular or feminized

92
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:26,400
and you can go and read a lot of details

93
00:03:24,658 --> 00:03:28,979
about the strains there on the website

94
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,840
that is of course a forever evolving

95
00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:32,759
work in progress some strains have not

96
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,439
been updated some have been heavily

97
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:37,259
updated there's a lot of details there

98
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:39,000
on iregenetics.com another great option

99
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:41,219
is to join the Discord and you can find

100
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,959
a Discord link on iregenetics.com

101
00:03:41,219 --> 00:03:45,658
actually hey web guy if you're listening

102
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:47,699
to this we may need to update the link

103
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:49,500
on Discord I'm not sure if that link

104
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:51,419
works it may have expired we may need to

105
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,158
fix that he watches the show this may be

106
00:03:51,419 --> 00:03:54,958
a good way to get him a message and if

107
00:03:53,158 --> 00:03:56,219
not it will remind me when I do some

108
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,500
editing I'm not even going to cut that

109
00:03:56,219 --> 00:04:00,419
out but there is a Discord if you go to

110
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,459
iregenetics.com there will be a link to

111
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:04,500
the Discord server on that Discord

112
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:06,539
server there are a lot of photos of the

113
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,580
plants being grown on the left tab if

114
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:10,139
you scroll down there will be a tab for

115
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:11,700
every strain that I have put out it'll

116
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:12,958
start with the rise and it goes all the

117
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:14,878
way down to whatever the last

118
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,798
alphabetical and what is there are a lot

119
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:19,319
of strains listed there on the Discord

120
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:21,060
server those are updated by people

121
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:23,579
growing those strains that's not just

122
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:25,500
done by mean by the web guy that is a an

123
00:04:23,579 --> 00:04:27,599
open source a community sourced platform

124
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,220
where everybody growing that strain is

125
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,320
free to go and post their reviews their

126
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:33,419
pictures their experiences they can ask

127
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:34,680
questions they can tell you details so

128
00:04:33,418 --> 00:04:36,379
if you want more info my first

129
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,939
recommendation is to check out

130
00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:40,439
iregenetics.com then after that I would

131
00:04:38,939 --> 00:04:42,360
recommend checking out the Discord

132
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:44,819
server where you can get a lot of extra

133
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:47,280
information also since we're talking

134
00:04:44,819 --> 00:04:49,319
about it if you go to iregenetics.com

135
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:51,000
and you notice that one of the strains

136
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:53,339
listed in the strain section does not

137
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,079
have a high quality photo if you happen

138
00:04:53,339 --> 00:04:57,478
to have a high quality photo of that

139
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:59,279
strain send me that picture also make

140
00:04:57,478 --> 00:05:01,680
sure to label it so I know which strain

141
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:03,179
that is send me your name also send me

142
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,978

143
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:07,079
stalk you and give you shout outs then

144
00:05:04,978 --> 00:05:08,519
most importantly send me your address so

145
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:10,680
that I can send you the gift of free

146
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:12,060
seeds for trading me that picture for my

147
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,379
website it's always great to have high

148
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:15,300
quality photos up there for advertising

149
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:17,399
advertising send me your favorite photo

150
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:19,620

00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:21,299
seeds if I use it on the website I may

152
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:23,220
just repost it to social media and give

153
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:24,720
you credit still may send you seeds but

154
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:26,520
no promise there if it goes on the

155
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,320
website you'll get a free pack of seeds

156
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:30,258
all right I've been rambling where was I

157
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:32,159
we're talking about the descriptions on

158
00:05:30,259 --> 00:05:34,020
iregenetics.com some of those

159
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,639
descriptions will be heavily detailed

160
00:05:34,019 --> 00:05:36,959
some of those will not be as super

161
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:38,759
detailed some of those are still

162
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:40,859
evolving I'm still learning about some

163
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:42,600
of these strains also some of them I

164
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:44,038
posted a long time ago and forgot to add

165
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,180
descriptions so if you need a

166
00:05:44,038 --> 00:05:47,219
description if there's something I've

167
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:49,079
forgotten also go ahead and send me a

168
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:50,880
heads up and I will do my best to update

169
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:53,459
those strain descriptions on

170
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:55,019
iregenetics.com

171
00:05:53,459 --> 00:05:56,758
all right this message came from my

172
00:05:55,019 --> 00:05:59,579
friend Richard and this did come from

173
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:01,740
the grow help tab on iregenetics.com

174
00:05:59,579 --> 00:06:03,740
which means guess what Richard you win a

175
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:06,000
free pack of seeds that's right on

176
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:07,800
iregenetics.com on the top there's a

177
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,259
bunch of tabs one of those tabs does say

178
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,819
grow help or grow questions if you click

179
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:13,560
on there and send me a grow question to

180
00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:15,839
the podcast if I read that question here

181
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,538
on the show you win free seeds and that

182
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:19,918
free seed giveaway is sponsored by

183
00:06:17,538 --> 00:06:22,019

Genetics seeds all right let's keep the

189
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:34,679
podcast moving I do have plenty of great

190
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:36,960
questions here in front of me the next

191
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:40,139
one also came from the grow help

192
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:42,180
submission tab on iregenetics.com the

193
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:43,918
name they want to be called is nostos I

194
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:46,199
think I said that properly

195
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:48,719
they have a general grow question and

196
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:51,240
the question goes a lot like this it

197
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,919
says Dear roster Jeff first and foremost

198
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,319
I'd like to take a quick second to thank

199
00:06:52,918 --> 00:06:57,359
you for you and the wonderful Ivory Army

200
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:59,340
for representing the best of what this

201
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,439
community has to offer bro thank you so

202
00:06:59,339 --> 00:07:03,659
much for noticing thank you for being a

203
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:05,038
part of the irie Army uh you're a big

204
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:07,500
part of that just sending me this letter

205
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:10,500
means you are definitely irie Army it

206
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:12,720
goes on to say in our current 2023 clown

207
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:15,180
World filled with inflated Egos and cash

208
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,680
hungry snakes it's beautiful to know it

209
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:18,840
is beautiful to know that there are

210
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,519
still folks out there who are doing the

211
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:23,279
good work and humbling themselves daily

212
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:25,079
for the benefit of others dude I try to

213
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:27,000
make the best seeds I can and keep them

214
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:28,620
affordable and grow from my heart and

215
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,079
breed with love so thank you for

216
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:32,519
noticing exactly that yes there are a

217
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:33,300
lot of snakes and a lot of clowns out

218
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:36,000
there

219
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:37,800
just do my best to avoid them I stay

220
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,418
neutral I stay peaceful and I stay out

221
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,978
of all the [ __ ] keep my head down

222
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:43,019
and keep working on my growth so thanks

223
00:07:40,978 --> 00:07:45,360
for noticing that part bro it does go on

224
00:07:43,019 --> 00:07:47,339
there is a question it says now my grow

225
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,439
question with a bit of context that

226
00:07:47,339 --> 00:07:51,659
always helps a little bit then it says

227
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:53,879
let's say hypothetically that someone

228
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:55,680
was fortunate enough fortunate enough to

229
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:57,240
snag a pack of the cream which was

230
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,038
cookies and cream to arise a great

231
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,300
strain which has been worked into Big

232
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:03,180
Mountain fudge cake and we'll continue

233
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:05,038
that uh project going on anyway it says

234
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:07,439
it says what if I were to find an

235
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:09,360
incredible phenotype from this F1 batch

236
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:11,639
yes that wasn't F1 the cream I made was

237
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,979
an F1 uh what if I find an incredible

238
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:16,740
phenotype from this F1 that has a strong

239
00:08:13,978 --> 00:08:18,839
pungent Aroma flavor of fresh ginger

240
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:21,418
with the effects that has one laying on

241
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:23,638
the floor due to intense OG like stoned

242
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:26,339
that comes on like a tidal wave bro that

243
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:28,079
uh what if hypothetically uh sign me up

244
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:30,000
bro I would hypothetically take two of

245
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:31,918
those let's turn it into dabs and see

246
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,299
how melted into the floor we can

247
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:34,978
possibly get

248
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:36,838
now the message goes on it says let's

249
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:39,360
hypothetically imagine that this Fino

250
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:41,940
produced less than a half a dozen seeds

251
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,639
which he labeled S1 with no noticeable

252
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:46,200
tissue issues of intersex or anthers

253
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:48,179
during late flower

254
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:50,040
so this person has grown the cream and

255
00:08:48,179 --> 00:08:51,838
they have produced half a dozen seeds

256
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:53,579
now when it says with no noticeable

257
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:56,160
issues of intersex or anthers during

258
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:58,320
late flower I'm assuming right now that

259
00:08:56,159 --> 00:09:00,719
those plants that the seeds came from

260
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:03,000
were not showing any noticeable issues

261
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,200
of intersex or anthers during light

262
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,059
flower I don't think we've grown the

263
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,860
seeds to find out what those do until

264
00:09:06,059 --> 00:09:10,439
the next sentence and the next sense we

265
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:12,240
do that part so we had a cream plant

266
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:15,360
that did not show any problems but it

267
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:17,278
did produce half a dozen seeds and this

268
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:21,240
person labeled those seeds S1 I'm not

269
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:23,458
sure are those S1 are they F1 are they

270
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,959
R1 or would we label those bag seeds

271
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:27,179
since I don't know the pollen donor

272
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:28,619
those seeds in my mind in my world as a

273
00:09:27,179 --> 00:09:31,199
breeder as somebody who puts seeds out

274
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:32,879
those become bag seed I only know one

275
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,860
parent I only know one part of the

276
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:37,320
equation so at this point I would not be

277
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:39,659
comfortable calling it an S1 because I

278
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:42,000
don't know what pollinated that plant if

279
00:09:39,659 --> 00:09:43,740
it was a self-pollination then possibly

280
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,659
but we don't know that we didn't reverse

281
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:47,159
anything so there's no way to confirm

282
00:09:45,659 --> 00:09:49,559
that

283
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:51,778
um it's not an F1 or it could be an F1

284
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:52,979
if something else pollinated it and we

285
00:09:51,778 --> 00:09:54,000
don't know what else is in the room we

286
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:56,220
don't know where the pollen could have

287
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,159
came from it definitely could be bag

288
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:00,778
seed as what I would label this so far I

289
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:02,278
would label it the cream bag seed is

290
00:10:00,778 --> 00:10:04,620
what it would say on my bag if I had it

291
00:10:02,278 --> 00:10:05,939
with the date on it also now let's go on

292
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:08,519
to the next sentence and said now fast

293
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:10,560
forward to the soft seeds being grown

294
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:12,778
out these s1s which I'm not sure they're

295
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:14,819
s1s honestly bro these bag seeds happen

296
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:16,919
to carry the ginger flavor of the aroma

297
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:18,240
with a nice body Stone so you got some

298
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:20,219
winners out of there that's pretty cool

299
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,659
that's why I always say grow those bag

300
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:23,339
seeds you guys you never know what

301
00:10:21,659 --> 00:10:24,838
you've got they could be amazing they

302
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:27,240
could be trash in this case it looks

303
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:29,880
like we've got winners so now we move on

304
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:31,680
to the question if these S1 seeds which

305
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:33,899
we're still kind of skeptical on that if

306
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:36,000
these S1 seeds were hypothetically produ

307
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:38,639
to produce their own set of self-seeds

308
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:42,659
would these be classified as cream S2 or

309
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:44,519
cream S1 F2 all right I understand the

310
00:10:42,659 --> 00:10:46,500
question but since we don't know what

311
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:49,440
pollinated that cream plant

312
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:51,179
it's hard to put proper labeling onto

313
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,399
these seeds

314
00:10:51,179 --> 00:10:55,319
I want to call it bag seed that's that's

315
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:57,720
what this is and then you've got like a

316
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:00,778
bag seed let me see what the did you

317
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:02,220
self it let's see growing those out uh

318
00:11:00,778 --> 00:11:04,379
if these seeds were hypothetically

319
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:07,019
produced to produce their own seeds

320
00:11:04,379 --> 00:11:08,939
um you could call those self seeds if

321
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:11,578
you want to those would be an S2 more

322
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:14,760
than an S1 F2 that would be an S2 s is

323
00:11:11,578 --> 00:11:16,319
the indication for self so I'm not sure

324
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:18,000
how I would label these because I

325
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,339
probably wouldn't continue with the bag

326
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,899
seat if if a plant is making seeds on

327
00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:23,519
its own I probably wouldn't continue

328
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:25,379
that that's not good for a breeder

329
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,519
that's not good for a production grower

330
00:11:25,379 --> 00:11:28,740
this is something I would have gotten

331
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:30,060
rid of uh probably the second time I

332
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:32,278
realized it made seeds it would

333
00:11:30,059 --> 00:11:33,838
disappear and I don't know if I would

334
00:11:32,278 --> 00:11:35,639
have gotten this far with the seeds as

335
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,860
you but now we can talk a little bit

336
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:40,019
about the labeling and how this would

337
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:42,120
have been labeled let's say

338
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:44,519
that that cookies that that cream plant

339
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:47,039
was given pollen that we know it was

340
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:49,679
given pollen if it was given pollen by a

341
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:51,539
regular plant a regular male plant that

342
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:53,338
would make it an F1 that's a new filial

343
00:11:51,539 --> 00:11:54,778
generation it's actually a poly hybrid

344
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:56,820
but that's a further podcast that I'm

345
00:11:54,778 --> 00:12:00,059
ready to have right now uh so that would

346
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:02,640
be an F1 if that plant was pollinated by

347
00:12:00,059 --> 00:12:04,199
the same plant if we cut two clones of

348
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,600
that cream plant and pollinated that

349
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:09,420
plant with the same stuff that would be

350
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:11,579
self if that plant was pollinated by

351
00:12:09,419 --> 00:12:14,338
anything else that was reversed that is

352
00:12:11,578 --> 00:12:17,278
in R1 that's a reversal so we change the

353
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:19,500
indication from S1 to R1 because self

354
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:21,539
gets the s1r gets the reversal

355
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:25,078
indication that's what I would do then

356
00:12:21,539 --> 00:12:28,199
if we take an S1 so we self-applying you

357
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:30,120
self it S1 Golden Goat S1 that exists I

358
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:32,278
took a Golden Goat female and a Golden

359
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:34,200
Goat female a reversed one made pollen

360
00:12:32,278 --> 00:12:36,899
put it on the girl now I've got Golden

361
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:38,579
Goat S1 seeds if I were to pull my

362
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:40,440
favorite Golden Goat phenotype out of

363
00:12:38,578 --> 00:12:42,479
there and repeat the process cut clones

364
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:44,639
of that one use one as a pollen donor

365
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,980
one is a pollen receiver that would be a

366
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:49,379
Golden Goat S2 the second self

367
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:51,360
degeneration so I see what you're asking

368
00:12:49,379 --> 00:12:53,939
and you were correct and you're thinking

369
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,320
that it would be an S1 or an S2 or an F1

370
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:57,720
or an F2 you're correct with that

371
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:59,940
thought process but I don't want to

372
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:01,980
label it that because the original bag

373
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:03,779
seed is where it came from I would call

374
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:05,820
it cookies and cream bag seed would be

375
00:13:03,778 --> 00:13:07,320
what it started as that would be its own

376
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:09,360
brand new thing because I'm not certain

377
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:11,100
about the pollen donor there is another

378
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,440
part to this question it says

379
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:14,759
additionally oh this is a whole other a

380
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,200
whole nother category a whole other

381
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:18,179
Branch off of this question so I think

382
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,740
I've answered the first part

383
00:13:18,179 --> 00:13:21,239
um we've talked about breeding labels

384
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:23,519
now let's talk about the second part of

385
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:26,459
this question additionally if you could

386
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:28,799
pick any land race varietal outside of

387
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:31,379
the modern OG cookies alien gene pool to

388
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:34,139
hybridize with the above project and add

389
00:13:31,379 --> 00:13:36,480
more stimulating narrow Leaf uh Buzz to

390
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:38,700
it what land race would you choose

391
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,259
that's a really good question uh but to

392
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:41,579
be to be frank honestly I wouldn't read

393
00:13:40,259 --> 00:13:43,139
with this plant because it's producing

394
00:13:41,578 --> 00:13:45,719
seeds and it's going to be problematic

395
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:47,700
in the future but if I were to breed

396
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:49,440
with the cookies and cream plant that's

397
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,940
got that lay you on the floor sort of

398
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,100
feeling that you're talking about you

399
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:55,680
want to put more headbuzz into it

400
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:57,720
I've got three options because I would

401
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:59,338
want to see the phenotype that you're

402
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,839
breeding with before I make my decisions

403
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:03,540
and then I would narrow it down but

404
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:06,540
sight unseen I would probably pollinate

405
00:14:03,539 --> 00:14:08,639
that plant with a Brazilian plant but

406
00:14:06,539 --> 00:14:10,078
the problem with Brazilian plants uh

407
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,659
they grow wild they get real tall

408
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:13,739
they're branchy they're out of control

409
00:14:11,659 --> 00:14:15,958
they're just a [ __ ] mess they go

410
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:18,539
every direction they're not really tame

411
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:20,819
the Brazilian land races go all over the

412
00:14:18,539 --> 00:14:22,679
place but the buzz that [ __ ] buzz

413
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:24,360
from a Brazilian plant it gets to your

414
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:26,458
brain it gets me all wild it gives me

415
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:28,680
that weird tunnel vision feeling that

416
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:31,259
would be awesome the next option would

417
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:33,239
probably be a tie cross it to a tie

418
00:14:31,259 --> 00:14:34,919
because again the tie is going to have a

419
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,778
real psychedelic head Buzz that real

420
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:38,458
like energetic euphoric sort of mind

421
00:14:36,778 --> 00:14:40,259
[ __ ] sort of thing which I really love

422
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:41,939
but that tie is going to be so much

423
00:14:40,259 --> 00:14:43,740
easier to grow than the Brazilian it's

424
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:45,720
going to be more uniform more classic

425
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:47,698
shaped it's not going to be all over the

426
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:50,940
place and branchy and stretchy and crazy

427
00:14:47,698 --> 00:14:54,539
uh like that Brazilian another option

428
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:57,720
um I recently was given a Nigerian Haze

429
00:14:54,539 --> 00:15:00,899
clone which I've only got in veg so far

430
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:02,519
but that thing is crazy it's vigorous uh

431
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:04,320
it's got a really nice structure to it

432
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:06,419
the leaves are beautiful the stem rub

433
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:09,060
smells good I may consider Crossing it

434
00:15:06,419 --> 00:15:10,620
to that Nigerian Haze once again those

435
00:15:09,059 --> 00:15:12,439
three the Brazilian the Thai and the

436
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:14,820
Nigerian I know that those have a crazy

437
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:16,139
psychedelic head buzz those plants have

438
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,760
that kind of buzz that when you smoke it

439
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:19,560
you get that psychedelic feeling you get

440
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:20,939
a drum circle going you get the fire

441
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:22,739
going and next thing you know it's the

442
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:23,820
next morning and everybody's like it was

443
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:25,019
a great night hanging out with you and

444
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:27,540
you're like where did time go I've been

445
00:15:25,019 --> 00:15:31,019
so high that sort of Buzz comes from

446
00:15:27,539 --> 00:15:33,179
those uh Brazilian the Thai the Congo

447
00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:35,820
the Nigerian regions like that will

448
00:15:33,179 --> 00:15:38,159
provide that crazy crazy buzz in my

449
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:39,480
experience so let's see where we are in

450
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:40,860
this question

451
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,600
um I probably wouldn't breed with this

452
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:45,300
but S2 is what I think you would call

453
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:47,278
that there I would choose Brazilian Thai

454
00:15:45,299 --> 00:15:49,379
or Nigerian to breed with this I've also

455
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:50,639
got a Congo plant to be fun to breed but

456
00:15:49,379 --> 00:15:51,899
I'm keeping that a little bit on the

457
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:53,698
down low for a while you guys haven't

458
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:55,440
seen much of my Congo work yet all right

459
00:15:53,698 --> 00:15:57,120
this message wraps up with thank you for

460
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,339
offering this spot on your website for

461
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,679
those of us who choose to avoid social

462
00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:02,820
media and chat servers I can respect

463
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:04,679
that a lot of people out there in

464
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:06,480
prohibition land don't want to be on

465
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:07,979
Instagram on Discord posted pictures of

466
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,120
their ganja plants when they shouldn't

467
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:10,740
be growing it at all and I understand

468
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,659
that the chat servers can make you a

469
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:14,039
little bit paranoid we try to be safe we

470
00:16:12,659 --> 00:16:15,899
do respect the people in prohibition

471
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:17,879
land but I'm glad you were able to reach

472
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:19,799
out and ask this great question uh they

473
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:21,600
wrap it up with love and respect from

474
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:23,399
your friend from prohibition land

475
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,199
allegedly bro I know you're in

476
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:26,879
California where it's legal you're just

477
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:29,399
trying to trick us into not knowing

478
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:31,919
where you are my buddy nosto's I think

479
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:33,720
that's how you say that I owe you a pack

480
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:35,099

481
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,720

491
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:58,679

493
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:03,838
found your show which was recommended in

494
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:05,279
the depths of a Reddit cannabis AMA that

495
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:07,620
is awesome big shout out to everybody

496
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:09,599

497
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:11,578
course supporting irie genetics and the

498
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:13,500
grow from your heart podcast on Reddit I

499
00:17:11,578 --> 00:17:15,178
did not realize that I had a following

500
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:17,519
or a ganja Community out there but I'm

501
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:20,100
glad somebody mentioned my podcast thank

502
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:21,900
you whoever that was and or is it goes

503
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:24,119
on it says I really appreciate your

504
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:26,579
podcast as you knowledgeably convey

505
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:28,558
expertise that most would take years to

506
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:30,359
realize if ever well thank you that's a

507
00:17:28,558 --> 00:17:32,160
huge compliment I feel like I've got to

508
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:34,019
give the this info out if I didn't give

509
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,298
out this if I didn't share my experience

510
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:38,160
and share this info uh it would be bad

511
00:17:36,298 --> 00:17:39,720
karma or something and it wouldn't work

512
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,298
right so I've got to keep this going for

513
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:44,038
you it says Google Scholar has a quote

514
00:17:42,298 --> 00:17:45,839
on their website that says stand on the

515
00:17:44,038 --> 00:17:47,460
shoulders of giants and advancing my

516
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:49,918
cannabis journey and improving my future

517
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:51,660
grow through your podcast feels very

518
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:53,940
much like this I appreciate that bro

519
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:55,798
thank you come along for the journey

520
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:57,419
um I just have ADD and I read a lot and

521
00:17:55,798 --> 00:17:58,918
I talk a lot so it ends up being a

522
00:17:57,419 --> 00:18:00,600
podcast is really what's happening here

523
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:02,759
I got a lot of passion for cannabis and

524
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:05,099
I want you guys to all grow and smoke

525
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:06,298
and have access to the best ganja in the

526
00:18:05,099 --> 00:18:08,219
world that way whenever I go to a

527
00:18:06,298 --> 00:18:10,139
concert and somebody lights up weed and

528
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:11,400
passes it to me I can smoke it with

529
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:13,200
confidence because we spread the good

530
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,820
word and everyone's growing good ganja

531
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,620
all right let me stay focused because

532
00:18:14,819 --> 00:18:17,460
obviously whatever I smoke just [ __ ]

533
00:18:16,619 --> 00:18:20,339
working

534
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:22,319
but says I am an American living in

535
00:18:20,339 --> 00:18:24,959
Germany oh that sounds interestingly

536
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:27,178
exciting and Germany may very likely

537
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,279
trial legal cannabis before full-on

538
00:18:27,179 --> 00:18:30,900
legalization for this reason I'm

539
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:33,660
planning a grow operation for both

540
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:36,419
medical and recreational and exclusively

541
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:38,460
on quality my goal is to bring the ethos

542
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:40,740
of the medical Growers to Europe and

543
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:43,140
demonstrate in Germany how an indoor

544
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:45,240
living soil system can shine bro this

545
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:46,799
sounds like a huge uh awesome project

546
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:49,079
I'm proud of you and I wish you the best

547
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:50,579
for this also be safe be careful and

548
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:52,139
stay legal it sounds like you're doing

549
00:18:50,579 --> 00:18:54,058
it right but well I wish you the best

550
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:55,559
for this this is hugely ambitious and

551
00:18:54,058 --> 00:18:56,579
I'm proud to be a part of this honestly

552
00:18:55,558 --> 00:18:59,399
I feel like I'm helping you out already

553
00:18:56,579 --> 00:19:01,798
it says I've already done Dr Elaine

554
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,600
Ingram Ingram's soil food web course

555
00:19:01,798 --> 00:19:05,700
which was recommended by our friend Sean

556
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:07,139
of several hundred episodes ago big

557
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:09,960
shout out to our buddy Sean and also big

558
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:11,038
shout out to Dr Elaine Ingram uh Ingham

559
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,240
there's no honor in there I've been

560
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:15,119
saying it wrong the whole time I just

561
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:17,160
read it Elaine Ingham anyway it says I'm

562
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:20,339
currently tackling soil mineral balances

563
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:22,620
and beneficial insect IPM regimens to go

564
00:19:20,339 --> 00:19:24,119
fully organic that's hugely ambitious as

565
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:26,339
well and I hope that works for you I am

566
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:27,719
not the organic grower I find there a

567
00:19:26,339 --> 00:19:29,759
whole set of different problems when it

568
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:31,380
comes to Growing organically but I'm

569
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:33,900
sure you've got a good team to help you

570
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:35,460
figure that out now it does say I'm

571
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:37,440
working backwards through your podcast

572
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:39,360
so I apologize if these topics have been

573
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,820
covered already I have about five

574
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:43,500
questions about your cultivars and

575
00:19:41,819 --> 00:19:45,298
terpenes for you this is going to get

576
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:47,038
fun you guys I love talking about the

577
00:19:45,298 --> 00:19:48,720
strains I bread Terps are one of my

578
00:19:47,038 --> 00:19:51,240
favorite subjects so this is going to be

579
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,798
good this is a great message oh and also

580
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:54,599
thank you for listening to the catalog

581
00:19:52,798 --> 00:19:56,819
of podcasts you've got a lot to catch up

582
00:19:54,599 --> 00:19:58,500
on you guys don't ever feel afraid to

583
00:19:56,819 --> 00:20:00,298
ask a question that you feel I may have

584
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:01,679
answered already because I may have

585
00:20:00,298 --> 00:20:03,779
learned something I may have changed my

586
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:05,580
opinion technology equipment something

587
00:20:03,779 --> 00:20:07,139
may have changed since the last time I

588
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:09,119
talked about that so feel free to ask

589
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:11,160
your question I may give a different

590
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:12,659
answer I may give a totally more

591
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:14,880
in-depth answer I may give a shorter

592
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:17,160
answer and also not everybody listens to

593
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,720
every episode so feel free to ask your

594
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:21,000
question that you've got don't be

595
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,558
worried about a repeat question I may

596
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,419
answer it I may filter it right on out

597
00:20:22,558 --> 00:20:26,879
let's get to this person's questions it

598
00:20:24,419 --> 00:20:29,038
does say as Germany will be a new market

599
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,200
I'm betting it will likely be initially

600
00:20:29,038 --> 00:20:33,538
flooded with flashy names like gelato

601
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,940
and blue dream or the old school names

602
00:20:33,538 --> 00:20:37,919
like white widow and Jack Herer and

603
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:39,660
medium quality at best that's probably

604
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:41,340
going to be accurate you're also going

605
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:43,919
to have a lot of older folks looking for

606
00:20:41,339 --> 00:20:45,538
uh Panama red and purple haze all the

607
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:47,640
old Stoner dudes are going to want that

608
00:20:45,538 --> 00:20:49,200
one that's what they all ask for here in

609
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:51,000
the states goes on though it does say

610
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,919
for this reason I'm seeking to stand out

611
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,200
from the crowd and focusing so heavily

612
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:56,940
on quality that's a good way to focus

613
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,980
most people are just going to produce as

614
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:01,140
much as they can and try to get it out

615
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:03,058
if you produce a top shelf product from

616
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:04,740
the beginning and maintain that you will

617
00:21:03,058 --> 00:21:07,500
stand out your dispensary your sales

618
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:09,660
will be top notch let me stay focused

619
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:11,279
now I can imagine that your cultivars

620
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:14,160
are your babies and you love them all

621
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:16,079
equally but differently so which of your

622
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:18,058
cultivars would you recommend for a

623
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:19,319
diverse for a diverse city of

624
00:21:18,058 --> 00:21:22,500
experiences

625
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:25,200
as well as medical applications in a

626
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:26,640
brand new and uninformed market and why

627
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,919
that's a really good question I like

628
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,720
this this gives me the opportunity to do

629
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:32,280
a little basic cannabis education and

630
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,319
also pitch a couple of my lines which

631
00:21:32,279 --> 00:21:36,298
will work very well so if you're opening

632
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:38,220
a dispensary if you want a good menu of

633
00:21:36,298 --> 00:21:40,259
flour uh this goes for anybody around

634
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:42,240
the world any dispensary I kind of

635
00:21:40,259 --> 00:21:44,220
believe that there are a few key flavors

636
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,079
or ranges that you should keep on the

637
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:47,759
shelf and those things I wrote them down

638
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:49,500
here I've got fruit you should always

639
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:51,359
have fruity stuff a lot of people love

640
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:53,700
fruity wheat especially the girls the

641
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:56,279
younger people really like Fruity weed

642
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:58,319
you should also have gassy weed I like

643
00:21:56,279 --> 00:22:00,658
weed that smells like gas a lot of the

644
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:02,339
older more experienced seasoned smokers

645
00:22:00,659 --> 00:22:04,620
we have learned that the gassy stuff is

646
00:22:02,339 --> 00:22:06,959
where the good Buzz is and I really like

647
00:22:04,619 --> 00:22:08,579
a good guess the aroma other things you

648
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:11,279
should have are floral something that

649
00:22:08,579 --> 00:22:14,158
smells like flowers some people really

650
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:16,558
love a floral smelling cannabis other

651
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:18,600
things I really like is a hazy cannabis

652
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:20,639
those are kind of spicier they're going

653
00:22:18,599 --> 00:22:22,319
to have your sandal wood your lavender

654
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,659
sort of smells that's going to come from

655
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:26,700
the hazes that may also play into the

656
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:27,960
floral side of things then another thing

657
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:30,720
I really think you should have is that

658
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:32,940
cushy and chem sort of Aroma that that

659
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,860
OG cush that chem dog chemical sort of

660
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:36,538
stuff that's different than the fuel so

661
00:22:34,859 --> 00:22:37,939
those are things that kind of range is

662
00:22:36,538 --> 00:22:42,058
what I think you should start with

663
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:44,038
fruity gassy floral cushy hazy Kimmy

664
00:22:42,058 --> 00:22:46,200
sort of stuff now let me tell you things

665
00:22:44,038 --> 00:22:48,359
in my lineup that I can recommend from

666
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:50,100
each of those flavor categories let's

667
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:52,319
start with the fruit category a lot of

668
00:22:50,099 --> 00:22:54,359
my stuff is really easily labeled to

669
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:55,740
identify into the fruit category one of

670
00:22:54,359 --> 00:22:57,779
the first I would recommend is

671
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:59,640
strawberry Starburst it tastes like

672
00:22:57,779 --> 00:23:02,519
strawberries it smells like strawberries

673
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:05,100
it grows gigantic Buds and it is also

674
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:06,480
very potent when grown dried and cured

675
00:23:05,099 --> 00:23:08,699
properly it also makes amazing

676
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,500
concentrates so the strawberry Starburst

677
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:12,659
is one I would recommend then of course

678
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:15,240
the sun kiss that is platinum Tangy to

679
00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:16,440
arise it tastes like sweet oranges and

680
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,419
once again you're going to get a lot of

681
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:20,580
good medical benefits from that good fat

682
00:23:18,419 --> 00:23:22,440
Harvest and that one is is super easy to

683
00:23:20,579 --> 00:23:24,298
grow another fruity one that I would

684
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,620
recommend maybe the blueberry butcher

685
00:23:24,298 --> 00:23:28,679
that one's got that blueberry candy

686
00:23:25,619 --> 00:23:29,939
turps and a really serious head Buzz the

687
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:32,759
next category we're going to work into

688
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:34,798
is the gassy stuff the gassiest one in

689
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:37,259
my lineup would be the machine the

690
00:23:34,798 --> 00:23:39,359
machine puts out super gassy Terps uh

691
00:23:37,259 --> 00:23:40,859
you can smell it for miles away and it

692
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:43,019
grows super easily another one that

693
00:23:40,859 --> 00:23:45,418
would fall into that category is fist

694
00:23:43,019 --> 00:23:47,940
bump fist bump is sour diesel to a rise

695
00:23:45,419 --> 00:23:49,559
that Sour Diesel is super fuely you're

696
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:52,980
gonna get those feel Aromas and field

697
00:23:49,558 --> 00:23:55,440
Terps out of the fist bump the next one

698
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:57,298
I wrote down is floral the character

699
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,640
Zero will have floral Terps to it

700
00:23:57,298 --> 00:24:01,379
Scarlet Begonias will have the floral

701
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:04,919
Terps to it a lot of people really seem

702
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:06,360
to enjoy that floral Rose lavender sort

703
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:08,220
of a terp that really gets a lot of

704
00:24:06,359 --> 00:24:10,500
people's attentions the next thing I

705
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:12,900
talked about was a haze it's going to be

706
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:15,179
harder to produce a quality Haze in a

707
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:17,159
commercial environment something like a

708
00:24:15,179 --> 00:24:18,659
Neville's Haze a real good Haze will

709
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:20,820
take a long time to produce something

710
00:24:18,659 --> 00:24:22,380
like a uh like a silver haze or

711
00:24:20,819 --> 00:24:24,480
something like that if you want that

712
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:26,100
real hazy flavor something like that

713
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,019
does take a little bit longer to flower

714
00:24:26,099 --> 00:24:30,418
but something like a Super Lemon Haze

715
00:24:28,019 --> 00:24:32,220
will give you that hazy Buzz without the

716
00:24:30,419 --> 00:24:34,259
length of flour those are usually 10 or

717
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:36,058
11 week flowers which is short for a

718
00:24:34,259 --> 00:24:38,819
haze you guys are saying 10 or 11 weeks

719
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:40,079
a long Haze can go 16 weeks I I've got

720
00:24:38,819 --> 00:24:41,939
one that takes quite a while I've got

721
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:43,740
two that take a long time so if I wanted

722
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:46,019
to recommend a hazy flavor something

723
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:47,940
that would have that hashy spicy flavor

724
00:24:46,019 --> 00:24:49,500
from my lineup I would say Sunday show

725
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:52,200
is probably the plant that you're

726
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:54,538
looking for for that Flavor now let's

727
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:57,419
move forward the next one is Kush and

728
00:24:54,538 --> 00:25:00,000
Cam that cushy kemi flavor I can't even

729
00:24:57,419 --> 00:25:02,940
describe Kush properly it's swampy it's

730
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,919
funky it's earthy uh it's got some moth

731
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:07,019
balls and some some funk to it some

732
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:08,700
dirty foot and then also there's the

733
00:25:07,019 --> 00:25:10,918
chem that falls into this same category

734
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:13,620
which is similar but just kind of

735
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:15,360
chemically and kind of just funkier you

736
00:25:13,619 --> 00:25:17,279
have to smell some good OG cushion some

737
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:18,899
good chem dog to actually I can't even

738
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:20,220
describe it properly it's that weed that

739
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:22,919
when when you walk through the concert

740
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:24,659
and you go that one that's probably a

741
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:26,940
cush or a Kim you need those sort of

742
00:25:24,659 --> 00:25:29,039
Aromas and flavors that earthiness that

743
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:31,500
chocolatiness those sort of fall in the

744
00:25:29,038 --> 00:25:33,119
cushy category so things for that uh

745
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:34,859
category that I would recommend from my

746
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:36,538
lineup the first one would be something

747
00:25:34,859 --> 00:25:39,058
that is very new that will come out in

748
00:25:36,538 --> 00:25:41,400
May is called Kingston Kush another one

749
00:25:39,058 --> 00:25:43,558
that falls into that category again is

750
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:45,240
the machine those will both give you a

751
00:25:43,558 --> 00:25:47,339
lot of chemi a lot of cushy sort of

752
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:49,500
Terps uh you may find some chocolate you

753
00:25:47,339 --> 00:25:51,538
may find some chemicals in there lots of

754
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:53,579
great flavors and Aromas so I would

755
00:25:51,538 --> 00:25:55,558
start with the fruit the gas the floral

756
00:25:53,579 --> 00:25:57,538
the cushion the chem and then if you can

757
00:25:55,558 --> 00:25:59,579
fit it into the grow I would work some

758
00:25:57,538 --> 00:26:01,079
Haze into their next I would definitely

759
00:25:59,579 --> 00:26:02,879
have something

760
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:04,619
um that gives people a major major head

761
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,179
bust something to get their heads spin

762
00:26:04,619 --> 00:26:08,099
in and then I would also recommend

763
00:26:06,179 --> 00:26:10,440
something more on the Indica side to get

764
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:12,599
them sort of chilled out then I may also

765
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:14,880
recommend something with some CBD in it

766
00:26:12,599 --> 00:26:17,038
I'm not sure the market for CBD in

767
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,960
Germany but here in the states a CBD

768
00:26:17,038 --> 00:26:20,158
product definitely would sell and of

769
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,960
course first the one I would recommend

770
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:23,100
for you there would be purple heart I'm

771
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:25,019
not sure how to get you Purple Heart

772
00:26:23,099 --> 00:26:27,418
seeds in Germany but we can do our best

773
00:26:25,019 --> 00:26:29,639
to allegedly make that happen there was

774
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:30,960
more to this question my friend it says

775
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,880
which of your cultivars would you

776
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,860
recommend to a new breeder to start

777
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,600
breeding unique phenotypes and then it

778
00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:38,459
says you will be credited on all of

779
00:26:36,599 --> 00:26:40,319
these phenotypes

780
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:41,640
um wow that is a really

781
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:43,678
um that's a really good question the

782
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:45,659
first thought was that I don't know that

783
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:48,120
I would breed with just my stuff because

784
00:26:45,659 --> 00:26:49,799
that kind of locks you in to a trap I've

785
00:26:48,119 --> 00:26:51,719
only made so many things and there are

786
00:26:49,798 --> 00:26:53,639
only so many plants to work with from my

787
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:55,620
lineup uh that I don't want to

788
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:57,419
accidentally steer you down the path of

789
00:26:55,619 --> 00:26:59,939
inbreeding and breeding yourself into a

790
00:26:57,419 --> 00:27:02,520
box and not having options so my first

791
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:04,080
idea would be to pick a male plant or a

792
00:27:02,519 --> 00:27:06,058
female plant I would say pick a male

793
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:07,859
from my lineup something that's got the

794
00:27:06,058 --> 00:27:09,778
traits you're looking for then I would

795
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:12,298
pick a female from other breeders

796
00:27:09,778 --> 00:27:13,980
lineups or other several females from

797
00:27:12,298 --> 00:27:15,538
several other breeders that way we can

798
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:17,819
create diversity

799
00:27:15,538 --> 00:27:20,099
I've only got so many male plants in my

800
00:27:17,819 --> 00:27:21,960
lineup so everything is going to have

801
00:27:20,099 --> 00:27:24,000
Golden Goat in it everything's going to

802
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:27,058
have a rise in it everything is going to

803
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,558
have either blueberry cookies or BC

804
00:27:27,058 --> 00:27:30,899
Lemon Skunk in it because I've only got

805
00:27:28,558 --> 00:27:32,278
so many options which is fun I could

806
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:34,320
find a couple of things that are not

807
00:27:32,278 --> 00:27:35,579
related and we could breed those but

808
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:37,139
then if you wanted to work with anything

809
00:27:35,579 --> 00:27:38,460
else in my lineup you've kind of worked

810
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:40,140
yourself into a trap because it's

811
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:41,460
already got most of that [ __ ] in it I

812
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:43,380
think you understand what I'm saying by

813
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:44,759
now I did write down some good ideas

814
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:46,980
though

815
00:27:44,759 --> 00:27:48,778
um I would take one for myself and then

816
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:51,538
I would take a mail from my stuff I'd

817
00:27:48,778 --> 00:27:53,460
probably pick like a um a Jack Tripper

818
00:27:51,538 --> 00:27:55,019
or a fist bump mail at this time I think

819
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:57,900
those would both be really fun to find a

820
00:27:55,019 --> 00:28:00,658
good male so the fist bump mail and then

821
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:02,640
like something fruity from Miss Jill and

822
00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:04,679
then something really Frosty from ethos

823
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:07,080
and then uh something really candy

824
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:08,759
flavored from seed junkie and then just

825
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:11,759
pick something from everybody else out

826
00:28:08,759 --> 00:28:13,019
there something really Frosty and terpy

827
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:14,700
from exotic

828
00:28:13,019 --> 00:28:16,139
just go find something from every

829
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:18,120
breeder out there that you enjoy I don't

830
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:21,240
know who you're into uh breed it to the

831
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:22,979
Cindy 99 from Mr soul but use my mail

832
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:25,079
and pollinate a bunch of different

833
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:26,940
females to create diversity is what I

834
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:30,119
would do but if it had to be from my

835
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:32,759
line I would breed the uh I would choose

836
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:34,859
a fist bump male and I would pollinate a

837
00:28:32,759 --> 00:28:36,179
John Lemon female is what I think I

838
00:28:34,859 --> 00:28:39,000
would do right now I think those would

839
00:28:36,179 --> 00:28:43,500
be really awesome uh you would get a

840
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:45,000
lemony Sour Diesel Kush Haze combo sort

841
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:46,919
of a thing that would be all of the

842
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,359
amazing [ __ ] that would have all of the

843
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:50,820
good stuff that you need and it would

844
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:52,619
grow vigorously I would taste super dank

845
00:28:50,819 --> 00:28:53,879
and I would have an amazing [ __ ] buzz

846
00:28:52,619 --> 00:28:55,739
and then I would do it the other way

847
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:57,360
also I do fist bump to John Lemon just

848
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:59,038
to see what the difference is all right

849
00:28:57,359 --> 00:29:00,479
then there's another question it says

850
00:28:59,038 --> 00:29:03,480
how would you recommend increasing

851
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,740
terpene content as a whole this one I'm

852
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:07,440
gonna say that I've recently done

853
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:09,659
multiple podcasts about increasing Terps

854
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:11,700
it's not just one thing that you can do

855
00:29:09,659 --> 00:29:14,100
to increase terpenes everything has to

856
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:16,440
be correct the the light has to be right

857
00:29:14,099 --> 00:29:18,599
the air the water the soil the nutrients

858
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:20,460
the dry backs the Harvest time

859
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:22,798
especially the dry and cure process

860
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:24,538
everything has to be perfect to get the

861
00:29:22,798 --> 00:29:26,579
terpenes dialed in you can't just add

862
00:29:24,538 --> 00:29:28,079
one Silver Bullet you can't just do one

863
00:29:26,579 --> 00:29:29,939
thing you've got to get the whole chess

864
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:32,038
board dialed in and Checkmate that

865
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:34,080
[ __ ] to get yourself the perfect

866
00:29:32,038 --> 00:29:37,500
terpenes then it says do you know to

867
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:40,619
increase any particular terpenes yes

868
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:42,720
um I've noticed that in lemon strains

869
00:29:40,619 --> 00:29:45,119
strains that naturally Produce High

870
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,440
limonene if I get them too close to the

871
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:49,259
white and give them a little bit of

872
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:51,480
light stress especially with an HPS that

873
00:29:49,259 --> 00:29:53,579
will heavily increase the limonene

874
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:55,740
production in plants that naturally

875
00:29:53,579 --> 00:29:57,480
produce limonene so put them a little

876
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:58,620
too close to the light watch them freak

877
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:00,179
out a little bit when you smoke them

878
00:29:58,619 --> 00:30:03,359
they're going to be [ __ ] super

879
00:30:00,179 --> 00:30:05,460
tremendously lemony also

880
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:07,500
um cold a little bit of cold at night

881
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:09,000
will bring out temperature I don't want

882
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:10,980
to tell you to go too extreme don't go

883
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,720
more than 10 degrees in your diurnal

884
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:14,759
difference your day and night swing but

885
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,319
if if you can get it kind of warm during

886
00:30:14,759 --> 00:30:18,058
the day and then a little bit colder at

887
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:19,859
night that will bring out some flavors I

888
00:30:18,058 --> 00:30:21,960
don't know the science behind that but

889
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:24,599
in my experience that has been a good

890
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:26,460
way to bring out some flavors also get

891
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:29,278
all your nutrients styled in add some

892
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:31,319
kelp add some carbs carbs and sugars are

893
00:30:29,278 --> 00:30:32,519
definitely going to help with that

894
00:30:31,319 --> 00:30:34,439
flavor so I've already done a full

895
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:36,599
podcast on getting the flavors and

896
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:39,000
Aromas but I'll get it all dialed in

897
00:30:36,599 --> 00:30:40,740
feed a lot of carbs a lot of sugars a

898
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,839
little bit of kelp in there and then dry

899
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:44,759
and cure properly and also it's proper

900
00:30:42,839 --> 00:30:46,918
uh strain selection you have to select

901
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:48,778
the proper strains for terpene

902
00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:50,880
production all right there is one more

903
00:30:48,778 --> 00:30:52,500
part to this question it says have you

904
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,179
noticed any influence from either

905
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:56,700
companion plants producing different

906
00:30:54,179 --> 00:30:58,259
soil exudates or if the terpenes and

907
00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:02,159
pheromones of other plants in the room

908
00:30:58,259 --> 00:31:05,099
influence the terpene profile honestly

909
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:07,080
um I don't grow like this I just grow in

910
00:31:05,099 --> 00:31:08,939
a very sterile grow room environment I'm

911
00:31:07,079 --> 00:31:12,000
not doing living soil I don't use

912
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:13,679
companion plants uh there are ganja

913
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:17,519
plants in my room so I don't really have

914
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:19,320
any useful information on this part here

915
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:22,019
but I honestly don't have any useful

916
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:24,778
information on uh if companion plants or

917
00:31:22,019 --> 00:31:26,220
their exudates or their terpenes will

918
00:31:24,778 --> 00:31:27,538
affect the other plants in the room I

919
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:30,000
really don't know that part I don't have

920
00:31:27,538 --> 00:31:32,158
any science behind that that is above my

921
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,839
pay grade my dude if anybody out there

922
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:35,940
does have any feedback on that send me a

923
00:31:33,839 --> 00:31:37,740
message I will read the feedback on the

924
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:40,259
show because that is one part I

925
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:42,058
definitely do not have a good answer for

926
00:31:40,259 --> 00:31:44,579
they do wrap this message up though it

927
00:31:42,058 --> 00:31:47,278
says also influenced by you I now send

928
00:31:44,579 --> 00:31:49,798
mental hugs to my mom in Texas daily

929
00:31:47,278 --> 00:31:51,659
every time I finish a podcast of yours

930
00:31:49,798 --> 00:31:52,859
I'll feed her Zane bro that is super

931
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:54,240
