00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:49,119
your breeding work thank you it says i

71
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:51,439
was also lucky enough to score some

72
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,360
lemon jeffrey a while back and they were

73
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:56,560
beautiful plants that grew the most

74
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,959
amazing daytime weed super energetic

75
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,280
social and she was a beauty that's a

76
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,319
great compliment thank you it goes on it

77
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,479
says

78
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:06,639
i now want to start making some seeds of

79
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:08,399
my own yeah that is the natural

80
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:10,559
progression a lot of people start

81
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,560
growing they get good at growing then

82
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,318
they realize i want to breed and see

83
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,400
what i can create that is a very natural

84
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:19,919
progression that's kind of how we ended

85
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,760
up where i am today it says after uh

86
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:24,079
after years of hearing you speak about

87
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:26,318
king solomon i thought your genetics

88
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:29,280
might be a good place to start i could

89
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:31,280
not get any arise seeds in my area but i

90
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,280
was able to score some dark hollow that

91
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,360
will still be great that'll be a great

92
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,039
project so many people are breeding with

93
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,799
the rise that you will set yourself

94
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:41,039
apart by breeding with the dark hollow

95
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,879
so that's a good start it says my plan

96
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:43,679
is to search this pack for a breeding

97
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:46,560
male

98
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:49,439
then hit that pollen to some proven

99
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,039
females that is a really good strategy

100
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:53,840
there are a couple of things i want to

101
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:55,679
touch on before i get too much further

102
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,080
a lot of breeders in this industry in

103
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,159
this game in this community do not like

104
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,319
it when new growers or growers or

105
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:04,798
breeders work with their stuff for

106
00:04:02,318 --> 00:04:07,039
breeding purposes they find it they're

107
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:09,360
territorial they're possessive they want

108
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:11,438
to have some control over their plants

109
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,080
i don't feel that way if you have

110
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:15,840
acquired seeds or plants of mine if you

111
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,600
paid for them if you traded for them if

112
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,478
you didn't steal them even if you did

113
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:24,000
steal them i can't stop you um you have

114
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:25,918
permission rights um my blessings to

115
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,319
breed with the seeds that i have made i

116
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:30,000
did not invent cannabis i didn't pull

117
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:32,240
seeds out of the sky i didn't fart out

118
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,160
some seeds and breed with those i used

119
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:37,360
seeds and plants that were bred by other

120
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:40,479
breeders before me so i find no problem

121
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,479
in breeding with my stock if you find a

122
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:44,319
male or a female in a pack of my seeds

123
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:46,560
that you want to work with i highly

124
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:48,879
encourage and promote you to do the

125
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,280
breeding work the only thing i can ask

126
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:53,199
for is credit if you sell those seeds if

127
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:55,359
you post them anywhere if the pictures

128
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:57,600
of those buds get any recognition when

129
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,160
you do list the cross give me some

130
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,479
credit put that that was a dark hollow

131
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,240
mail from ire genetics that was used for

132
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:06,800
the pollen donor or put that it was a

133
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,879
strawberry starburst or a orange gasm or

134
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,478
a sun-kissed female whatever you use

135
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:13,360
just give me credit that's all that i

136
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:15,199
really want also a few seeds would be

137
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,960
cool if you want to send me beans that

138
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,478
would be polite however i don't have

139
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:20,959
time or space to run them right now

140
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:22,879
anyway so that wouldn't be too much of a

141
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:24,879
setback if i didn't get that pack if you

142
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:26,719
did send them i would find time to run

143
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:28,478
them and when i do run them i would send

144
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,400
you a clone of the keeper is usually how

145
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:32,478
that works anyway

146
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:34,399
i wanted to make sure that people do i

147
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:36,478
know realize and understand you've got

148
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:38,399
full permission to breed with the seeds

149
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:40,719
you've acquired from me once you pay for

150
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:42,959
those they're yours it's like if you

151
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,160
bought a ferrari and the car dealer

152
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:46,000
tried to tell you now you can't drive

153
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,520
this car like an [ __ ] what is the

154
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,918
point you bought a ferrari you want to

155
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:52,478
drive like an [ __ ] go have fun i feel

156
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:53,758
the same about my seeds now i said there

157
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:55,758
was a couple of things i wanted to

158
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,439
unpack in that statement one more thing

159
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,600
i want to talk about you have got a pack

160
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:00,719
of dark hollow seeds and you are looking

161
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,639
for a male

162
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,080
one thing i always say is when we get

163
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,199
seeds when you get a seed pack we're

164
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:07,199
probably going to get you've probably

165
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,280
got a 10 pack you're probably going to

166
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:12,400
find approximately five males five

167
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:15,119
females something i want to mention is

168
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:18,239
when it comes to breeding i never use

169
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,319
the first male plant of the bunch that

170
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,280
shows me it's a boy for my breeding

171
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:26,879
project that first plant to display male

172
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:30,318
traits in my opinion is going to be too

173
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:31,759
much male for the mix let me try to

174
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,000
explain what i mean

175
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:37,360
that first dude to show you that he's a

176
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,199
boy is just too much testosterone

177
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,479
maybe he's he's there's nothing wrong

178
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,160
with that plant but i wouldn't use him

179
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:45,199
for breeding he's going to put too much

180
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,680
of himself into the offspring

181
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,478
a lot of times my goal when i'm breeding

182
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,199
is to

183
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:53,519
mix or blend the male and the female and

184
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,360
have traits of both parent plants show

185
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:57,439
in the offspring

186
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,038
if we use a male plant that is too

187
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:01,519
dominant we're just going to be

188
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:03,519
reproducing that male plant in all of

189
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:07,120
the progeny so if you cross

190
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:08,959
that male plant to strawberry to orange

191
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,240
to bubble gum you're going to wash out

192
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:12,159
the orange and the strawberry and the

193
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,918
bubble gum and just recreate more of

194
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,960
that male plant because he's got too

195
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:19,279
much of his genetics into the mix so a

196
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:22,159
lot of times i completely skip the first

197
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:24,559
and second male to start showing me that

198
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:27,360
they are male plants oftentimes those

199
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,800
are really tall really stretchy really

200
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,439
fibrous plants and we don't want to

201
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,439
breed tall stretchy fibrous offspring we

202
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:35,918
want to make vigorous potent offspring

203
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:37,038
so get rid of those tall stretchy dudes

204
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:38,478
that are just going to make tall

205
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:40,800
stretchy offspring we're not trying to

206
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:41,758
make hemp here we want to make cannabis

207
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,400
so

208
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,720
i would get rid of the first maybe even

209
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:49,359
the second dude to show me that it's a

210
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,440
dude i usually work with that third or

211
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,520
fourth male out of a group of five

212
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:55,839
honestly i would rather have more seeds

213
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:57,680
to choose from but if you've got quality

214
00:07:55,839 --> 00:08:00,000
seeds you will find a keeper in that 10

215
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,400
pack you will find a boy worth working

216
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,240
with now i think i've unpacked the two

217
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:06,399
things i wanted to talk about in there

218
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,598
let's move forward and read more of this

219
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:09,519
message

220
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:12,000
it does go on to say i've always been a

221
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:13,598
fan of the strain specific episodes and

222
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,240
i was wondering if you would consider

223
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:18,719
doing one on king solomon to help me

224
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,879
find a boy with similar traits to help

225
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:24,080
me understand what makes him special

226
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:26,240
compared to other male plants all right

227
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:28,318
that is a great question i love that you

228
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,079
appreciate these strain specific

229
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,800
episodes sometimes i feel like those are

230
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:34,559
uh bragging or tooting my own horn or

231
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:37,120
advertising or whatever but i love that

232
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:39,038
you guys appreciate those so thank you

233
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,278
so in this episode what i'm going to try

234
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:43,120
to do is kind of a mash-up we're going

235
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:45,039
to talk about solomon we're going to

236
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:48,240
talk about his traits what he is why i

237
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:50,240
selected him why he works so well for me

238
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,799
in that same process we're going to talk

239
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,959
about everybody else selecting a male

240
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:56,799
plant for a breeding project what we

241
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:59,278
have to keep in mind here

242
00:08:56,799 --> 00:09:01,439
is we've got different goals or possibly

243
00:08:59,278 --> 00:09:03,439
different goals i don't know your total

244
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,080
outcome goal here you said you want to

245
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,760
cross the dark hollow with a few proven

246
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,480
females and then we'll see what that

247
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:10,720
does

248
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,639
i don't know your ultimate goal my goal

249
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,360
is to make seeds for commercial

250
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:17,759
production and for retail sales there's

251
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,399
i've got a goal my seeds have to work in

252
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:22,399
a variety of grow spaces they've got to

253
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,559
germinate well they've got to give us

254
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,320
what we're expecting i don't know your

255
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:28,319
goal so we've got different goals we've

256
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,560
also got a different male plant to work

257
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,839
with here so it's all about the goal

258
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:33,439
keep that in mind that we've got

259
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,600
different goals and different starting

260
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,839
ingredients but i'm sure that you can

261
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:41,759
follow along so let's jump right into it

262
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:44,640
and talk about what is king solomon king

263
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:48,319
solomon is a specially selected male

264
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:50,559
plant from a batch of arise f1 seeds

265
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,680
what the heck does that mean i took a

266
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:56,879
golden goat female and a daybreaker male

267
00:09:53,679 --> 00:10:00,799
and i pollinated the golden goat female

268
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:04,240
that made a rise f1 from that batch of

269
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:07,519
arize f1 seeds i found a male that stood

270
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:10,240
out to me in many ways for many reasons

271
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:12,560
that male has been named king solomon

272
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,639
i've got one plant that is a dude with

273
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:17,199
his own specific name that's how much i

274
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:19,278
like him that's how much i rely on him

275
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,278
that's how successful he has been and if

276
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:23,759
you're curious about the name uh that is

277
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:26,078
some torah biblical stuff research king

278
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:27,838
solomon uh king solomon was a king he

279
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:30,799
could have had anything he wanted his

280
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:33,120
weaknesses was that he loved the ladies

281
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:35,519
so i named my male plant solomon because

282
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:38,240
he has pollinated a lot of ladies he's

283
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:41,759
doing work spreading his generations so

284
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:43,759
king solomon is in a rise f1 male just

285
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:46,240
in a rise male selected from a batch of

286
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:48,159
seeds i love the way he grew i knew he

287
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:51,278
was gonna stick around i gave him his

288
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:53,278
own name he is king solomon i call him

289
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:55,039
saul i call him sully

290
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:56,879
he gets a lot of names around here he

291
00:10:55,039 --> 00:11:00,639
gets a lot of love so that is king

292
00:10:56,879 --> 00:11:04,480
solomon an f1 arise male now let's talk

293
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:06,639
about uh why i chose that male why did i

294
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:09,120
choose him i grew out a bunch of seeds

295
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:11,679
and i ran a bunch of male plants side by

296
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,879
side and this is the one that stood out

297
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:15,199
why

298
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:18,879
i really liked the vigor this plant has

299
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:21,680
got hyper vigor he veges super quickly

300
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:23,439
he flowers super quickly a lot of people

301
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:25,838
tell me that they have to adjust their

302
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,480
scheduling differently because they are

303
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:30,880
growing a rise crosses in their grow and

304
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,519
the plants veg so quickly they can cut

305
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:36,000
off a week or two weeks of veg time so

306
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:38,240
that is how quickly a rise grows that

307
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,958
trait from that male plant that passes

308
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,560
on to most of his offspring so he's got

309
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:44,799
great vigor that is one of the main

310
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:47,599
traits that i like about him he's also

311
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:50,159
known for having good resistance many of

312
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:53,040
his progeny the offspring he makes are

313
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:55,679
resistant to pathogens powdery mildew

314
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:57,838
mold and also bugs like spider mites you

315
00:11:55,679 --> 00:12:00,239
see a lot of these plants don't get as

316
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:02,720
badly affected by bugs as many other

317
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,959
plants in the garden i also really like

318
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:07,120
the shape and the structure of king

319
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:09,278
solomon he's got a good shape and a good

320
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,679
structure and that translates into the

321
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:13,838
plants that come from him his progeny

322
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:15,919
have a good shape and a good structure

323
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:18,079
and hyper vigor so that is really

324
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:20,240
important for a male plant now let's

325
00:12:18,078 --> 00:12:21,838
talk about one of the most obvious and

326
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,000
most important traits that come from

327
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:27,519
king solomon solomon is known for

328
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:30,159
passing on extremely high potency

329
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:32,639
everything solomon touches turns to gold

330
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:34,399
in my opinion it comes out vigorous it's

331
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:37,200
got good structure it grows quite

332
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:39,600
quickly and it is super potent sometimes

333
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,440
i call king solomon the fixer or the

334
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,600
corrector plant because i'll have a

335
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,279
female plant that i really like the way

336
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,278
that it grows but it's just missing

337
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:49,039
something maybe it's not putting out

338
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:50,879
enough harvest weight maybe it's not

339
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:52,879
putting out enough potency maybe it

340
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:55,039
doesn't grow quickly enough so i will

341
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:57,838
pollinate it with king solomon and that

342
00:12:55,039 --> 00:13:00,000
seems to improve and put other plants

343
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:02,399
into turbocharged whatever i pollinate

344
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,200
it with the offspring is the female

345
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:07,679
plant plus turbo it is the female plant

346
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,519
plus more trichomes more potency and

347
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:11,838
more vigor and more harvest weight so

348
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:14,480
that's a big part of why solomon is a

349
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:16,959
great male he adds resistance he adds

350
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,879
vigor he adds potency and he doesn't

351
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:21,359
disrupt the flavor too much if i have a

352
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:23,039
female plant that's got a great flavor i

353
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,200
know that saul is going to go in there

354
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:26,799
and fix the structure the potency and

355
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,639
he's going to leave that flavor that the

356
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:31,519
females got so i can find that good

357
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:33,120
balance that's why i like to cross it to

358
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,560
you've seen it across to a strawberry

359
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,799
plant not a strawberry but a strawberry

360
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:38,399
flavored plant an orange flavored plant

361
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:40,159
a blueberry flavored plant because i

362
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:42,159
like to keep those terps and those

363
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:44,559
flavors in there but i want to add that

364
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:47,439
vigor that potency i think it's really

365
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:49,759
coming from king solomon so that potency

366
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:52,399
is a main factor that everybody relies

367
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:54,399
on we love that potency i also love that

368
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:56,000
it is a fixer like i said if there's a

369
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,078
plant that's just not performing the way

370
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,919
that i need it to pollinate it with king

371
00:13:58,078 --> 00:14:03,120
solomon the seeds that come from that

372
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:06,559
will be that original female plus turbo

373
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:08,078
plus bonus plus diesel plus super charge

374
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:09,759
because we hit it with king solomon it

375
00:14:08,078 --> 00:14:11,759
gives it that potency and then it

376
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:13,439
doesn't ruin the flavor but it gives it

377
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:15,278
it just turbocharges the flavor it kind

378
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,360
of adds a little gas to it a little funk

379
00:14:15,278 --> 00:14:19,600
to it and who doesn't love a little gas

380
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,440
a little funk added to almost any strain

381
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,040
you're smoking so that's a big part of

382
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,480
why we chose solomon let me take a look

383
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:26,639
at these notes here

384
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,120
it does not ruin the buzz and it doesn't

385
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:31,839
overpower the crosses it lets the female

386
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,360
shine that's something i find important

387
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,519
if we're trying to make a cross i like

388
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,959
to see the male traits and the female

389
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,839
traits in the cross so i want that

390
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:41,439
potency the vigor the aggression from a

391
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,040
rise but then i still want those

392
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,199
strawberry terps and that plant

393
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:48,159
structure and i want to see both of them

394
00:14:45,198 --> 00:14:50,399
in the mix and arise tends to not over

395
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:52,879
dominate in the crosses

396
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:56,078
so that is basically why i have chosen

397
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:58,720
king solomon uh he adds vigor he adds

398
00:14:56,078 --> 00:15:00,719
aroma he adds potency uh he adds

399
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:03,120
resistance he fixes things if you've got

400
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,720
a plant that is not living up to par

401
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,959
that is doing a lot of great things but

402
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:09,278
it's missing something king solomon

403
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:11,198
likely will add what it is missing

404
00:15:09,278 --> 00:15:13,360
that's why i've chosen to breed almost

405
00:15:11,198 --> 00:15:15,120
everything in my garden gets pollinated

406
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,839
by king solomon and then we see what it

407
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,600
does now let's talk about your breeding

408
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:21,600
project your project is different than

409
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,680
mine it starts off different because

410
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,199
you've got a different male we can't

411
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:27,278
make the same thing because you don't

412
00:15:25,198 --> 00:15:29,198
have the same male as me which is good

413
00:15:27,278 --> 00:15:30,720
i'm already making a rise crosses a lot

414
00:15:29,198 --> 00:15:32,639
of people are already making a rise

415
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,800
crosses you're going to make some dark

416
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,799
hollow crosses which will be great but

417
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:39,039
we've got to i want to help you select

418
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:42,639
your mail and give you some ideas of how

419
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:44,719
to select that dude um what is your goal

420
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:47,759
the most important part of any breeding

421
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,839
project is knowing a goal what do you

422
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:52,000
want to do what do you want to create

423
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:54,079
what what are you lacking what is not in

424
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,839
your garden maybe you've got a female

425
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:58,078
plant that you want to fix what is that

426
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:00,000
female plant not giving you

427
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:01,758
before you do this cross before you

428
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,198
chuck any pollen

429
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:05,120
write down the male plants you're going

430
00:16:03,198 --> 00:16:06,639
to use the male plant you are going to

431
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:10,078
use and the female plants you're going

432
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:12,959
to use list the females then make kind

433
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:14,799
of a prediction a hypothesis a theory

434
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:16,638
what are these crosses going to be like

435
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:19,278
once you make them if you cross this

436
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:21,039
dark hollow male to female number one

437
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:23,278
what is your predicted goal what will

438
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:25,679
the aromas and flavors be like how will

439
00:16:23,278 --> 00:16:27,838
it grow what phenotypes are you looking

440
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:29,838
for why did you do this list that for

441
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:32,800
every cross you're about to make

442
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:35,360
then make the cross then the funnest

443
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:37,599
part is growing out those seeds to see

444
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,680
what you did the only way to find out

445
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:42,639
what your male plant is doing

446
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:44,879
to the crosses is by pollinating several

447
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:46,639
females and then growing those out and

448
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:49,759
looking at the differences in those

449
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:52,159
crosses when you cross it to strawberry

450
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:53,839
does it still taste like strawberry or

451
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:55,759
does it taste like strawberry or did we

452
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,759
wash that out when you cross it to

453
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:59,839
blueberry does it taste like blueberry

454
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:01,919
or did we wash that out did it get the

455
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:04,480
vigor of the male plant the terps of the

456
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:06,639
female what's it doing find out what it

457
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,480
is contributing to the mix if you just

458
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,079
cross it to one plant you're only going

459
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,240
to see one set of traits it's hard to

460
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:13,838
identify what the male is doing unless

461
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,838
it's really obvious if you put it to

462
00:17:13,838 --> 00:17:17,678
several females we can really see what

463
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:20,159
the effects are on all of those

464
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:22,240
different female plants so i would start

465
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,400
off by looking for a plant with the

466
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,798
structure you are looking for how do you

467
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,400
want your future plants to be shaped i

468
00:17:26,798 --> 00:17:30,720
like kind of taller plants because i

469
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,880
like those sativa dominant plants with

470
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:35,519
big colas because i like a lot of herb

471
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,520
and i like a uh a really head ripping

472
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:39,200
head buzz and i think sativa dominant

473
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:41,359
tall skinny plants give me that head

474
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,919
buzz i'm looking for so i would look for

475
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:46,319
tall skinny plants with long skinny

476
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:48,559
leaves maybe that's not what you want

477
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:50,399
find the leaf shape and plant structure

478
00:17:48,558 --> 00:17:52,558
that you want we know that bigger whiter

479
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,840
leaves are usually more indica dominant

480
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:56,160
skinnier leaves are going to be more

481
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:58,798
sativa dominant find the leaf shape and

482
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,960
plant structure that suits your goal

483
00:17:58,798 --> 00:18:03,440
what are you looking for then one thing

484
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,600
to think about is aroma and flavor what

485
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,679
does this plant smell like give it a

486
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:09,199
stem rub smell your fingers does it

487
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,880
smell like vomit does it smell like

488
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,038
trash can does it smell like fruit does

489
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,840
it smell like berries what are you

490
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:18,319
looking for i really like a male plant

491
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:20,798
that smells like vomit if the male plant

492
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:22,798
smells acrid and gross that's probably

493
00:18:20,798 --> 00:18:25,200
going to translate into good stuff in

494
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:27,440
the offspring keep in mind this is one

495
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,759
ingredient this isn't the total equation

496
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:32,480
you're going to add that dirty stinky

497
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:34,000
socks gasoline and bar trash can to

498
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,240
other things and see how they mix

499
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,359
together so i really like a male that's

500
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:41,919
got a nasty gross acrid putrid vomit bar

501
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:43,599
trash can kind of aroma now another

502
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:46,960
really important thing to think about in

503
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:49,279
my opinion is flowering time do you want

504
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,759
plants to take a long time to flower in

505
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:53,599
my opinion longer flowering plants get

506
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:55,519
better potency i just like that longer

507
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:57,279
flowering plant i feel like it can do

508
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:59,759
something more with the potency the buzz

509
00:18:57,279 --> 00:19:01,440
is better or do you need a rush plant

510
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:03,519
that gets out of there in eight weeks

511
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:06,000
then i would find a male that finishes

512
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:07,759
the flowers in eight weeks if you need a

513
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,240
plant that finishes sooner i would find

514
00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:12,319
a faster flowering male the only way to

515
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,558
do that is to let the males flower out

516
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:16,720
in the test room so let me talk about

517
00:19:14,558 --> 00:19:18,639
that for a little bit i might not even

518
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:21,360
pollinate with the first run of growing

519
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:23,280
this male plant i might grow out five

520
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:25,199
male plants and finish them let them go

521
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:27,519
nine weeks let them go ten weeks and see

522
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:30,080
what they do at week ten you may watch

523
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:32,319
one plant bulk up it may stop making

524
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:33,918
pollen it may keep making pollen those

525
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:36,240
are things to look for how does that

526
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:38,559
plant act at a few weeks into flower

527
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,240
seven eight nine does it do weird [ __ ]

528
00:19:38,558 --> 00:19:42,639
does it give you nutrient issues does it

529
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,319
start doing does it explode with growth

530
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,240
does it stop putting out trichomes it

531
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:48,399
start putting out trichomes pay

532
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,079
attention to that grow that male plant

533
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,679
out as long as you can

534
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:53,359
then the next time you run it is when

535
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:55,280
you want to collect the pollen and do

536
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:56,879
the pollination i wouldn't collect

537
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:59,038
pollen if you've got multiple dudes

538
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,880
around because who knows uh it's going

539
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:02,960
to be a mori situation we won't know who

540
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,840
the baby daddy is if you got multiple

541
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,600
dudes around so grow those dudes out

542
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:09,199
flower them see what they do see how

543
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:11,199
they perform how do they handle

544
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,960
nutrients how do they handle light

545
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,960
what's going on laid in flower a lot of

546
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,120
people don't even know what a male plant

547
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:19,120
is going to look like at week 10.

548
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:22,239
get your boys to week nine week ten see

549
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:24,239
what they do pick one from there then do

550
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,880
the pollination in the next run that's

551
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,960
what i would do so then that is the main

552
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,840
part you get to do pollination pollinate

553
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,519
the plants then finish those seeds then

554
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:35,678
that is when we really get to do the

555
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:37,519
test germinate those seeds do they

556
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:39,120
germinate if they don't germinate i

557
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:40,960
wouldn't really continue too far making

558
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:42,719
more of those seeds then after

559
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,640
pollination is the fun part you get to

560
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,720
wait for the seeds to finish then you

561
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,480
get to harvest them pull the seeds out

562
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,000
of each plant that you pollinated keep

563
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,319
them separate make sure they're labeled

564
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
so you know what you're growing then

565
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:55,279
grow as many as you can i don't know

566
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,839
your legalities i don't know your

567
00:20:55,279 --> 00:21:00,319
limitations but i would grow at least 10

568
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:02,959
of each one and take a lot of notes see

569
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:05,359
what they do compare similarities and

570
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,600
differences between each cross then we

571
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:10,079
can see what that male plant is doing to

572
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:11,599
the mix if you don't like what he did

573
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:14,399
don't be afraid to throw those seeds

574
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:15,918
away give them away flush them whatever

575
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,080
you want to do just let people know that

576
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:19,440
that wasn't a winner don't sell them as

577
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:22,399
winter seeds that'll mess up your

578
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:24,400
reputation but try again don't be afraid

579
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,640
to try again i have thrown away a lot of

580
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,480
seeds don't be shy to throw seeds away

581
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,520
feed them to the birds use them as

582
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:33,839
compost don't put out shitty seeds to

583
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:35,519
the community please but the main way to

584
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:37,439
find out what you've done the only way

585
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:40,480
really to find out what you've done is

586
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:43,038
to grow those seeds and it's really fun

587
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:45,279
in my opinion growing a male plant

588
00:21:43,038 --> 00:21:47,119
finding a male then pollinating some

589
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:49,279
multiple female plants then growing

590
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:51,439
those and seeing the similarities and

591
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:53,038
the differences in all of those plants

592
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,480
if you've grown

593
00:21:53,038 --> 00:21:56,319
anything of mine that's been crossed to

594
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,558
a rise if you've grown more than one or

595
00:21:56,319 --> 00:22:00,319
two of those crosses you can see what

596
00:21:58,558 --> 00:22:02,000
solomon is doing and what the females

597
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:03,918
are doing to that cross

598
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,159
after a lot of growing and breeding it

599
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:07,759
will become very obvious to you what the

600
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:09,360
male plant is doing and what the female

601
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:11,440
is doing you'll start to identify that

602
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:13,199
very quickly it's like learning your

603
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,640
children you can say oh you got that

604
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,720
from your father or you got that from

605
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,559
your mother you'll start to see that and

606
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,558
it becomes very natural very obvious

607
00:22:18,558 --> 00:22:22,879
very quickly i think that is called

608
00:22:20,558 --> 00:22:24,639
developing an eye for breeding and it

609
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,559
took me a long time to do that but now i

610
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,080
can just look at plants and i go man i

611
00:22:26,558 --> 00:22:30,480
need to pollinate that girl with solomon

612
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:32,798
and it will make this and then 90 of the

613
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:35,360
time my predictions in my head come out

614
00:22:32,798 --> 00:22:37,119
exactly how i expected them all right

615
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:39,199
ladies and gentlemen boys girls pimps

616
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:41,519

618
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:45,359
darcy thank you guys for listening to

619
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,038
this episode my throat is burning out my

620
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:48,959
voice is going to be completely gone

621
00:22:47,038 --> 00:22:51,119
here pretty soon so it is time for me to

622
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,279
wrap up this episode i hope you learned

623
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:54,879
a lot i hope i answered your question um

624
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:57,839
i choose my mail

625
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:59,919
based on the goal then i check for a

626
00:22:57,839 --> 00:23:02,079
certain criteria how is it shaped how is

627
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:04,320
it smell how does it grow does it give

628
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:06,319
me enough pollen to make seeds how long

629
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:08,480
is that pollen window does it make

630
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:09,599
trichomes does it make colors how does

631
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,919
it smell

632
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:13,918
dj short smokes is male plants he dries

633
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:16,240
out the buds and smokes the flowers i

634
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,679
don't do that dj short does that maybe

635
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:20,079
that's something you will do see if that

636
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:21,440
male plant gives you a buzz then once

637
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:23,359
you have selected your male plant that

638
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,919
you find appropriate pollinate your

639
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:28,079
female plants then pollinate multiple

640
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:30,480
females is my advice then grow out as

641
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:32,960
many of those as you can compare notes

642
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,960
see what that male is delivering to the

643
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,880
cross if that male is doing what you

644
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,519
want it to do pollinate a bunch more

645
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:41,679
plants continue with filial generations

646
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:44,480
if it's not doing what you want get more

647
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:46,720
seeds find another dude start over take

648
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:49,200
a lot of notes don't ever be afraid to

649
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,880
scrap a breeding project or go backwards

650
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,880
sometimes that's how it works we don't

651
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,880
always make the right selections it is

652
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,480
always about selection all right that's

653
