25
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,640
a bunch of local flower man i've been

26
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,920
hitting different shops lately and uh

27
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,280
i think a lot of people heard me

28
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,760
bitching about people not tripping

29
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,120
because

30
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:57,039
things have been looking a lot better

31
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:58,718
than they were a few months ago i bought

32
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,800
some dispensary herb and it

33
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,640
is completely super trimmed i haven't

34
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:04,478
seen herb trim like this in a long time

35
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,760
it is very well trimmed so they may have

36
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:07,438
been listening to you

37
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,880
yeah the last couple runs i've made

38
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:11,759
everything looked a lot better

39
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:12,798
so good check out your local shops dig

40
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,640
up some flour

41
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,479
there you go uh have you noticed that

42
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,239
shops uh their menus are changing

43
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:19,359
rapidly i feel like there's a lot more

44
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:21,039
cannabis consumption

45
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:22,478
every day yeah people are buying the

46
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,080
shops out there cleaning it out really

47
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:24,798
quickly they're having to restock really

48
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:26,239
quickly

49
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,159
i haven't seen traffic at the

50
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:29,599
dispensaries like this in a long time so

51
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,680
this is pretty interesting it's like 4

52
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:33,839
20 every day at the dispensary now

53
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,520
the sales reports reflect that too that

54
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,960
did get reported in the press

55
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:38,879
yeah it's been a ridiculous year for

56
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:40,078
cannabis uh we kind of predicted that at

57
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:41,679
the start of the uh the whole

58
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:43,118
thing here i said this cannabis is going

59
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,399
to go crazy even when they were doing

60
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:46,000
curbside service they were still

61
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,719
crushing it

62
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,759
yeah i uh i went to the shop today and

63
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:51,599
drove right past

64
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:54,079
because their parking lot was absolutely

65
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:56,959
full and they had a line out the door

66
00:01:54,078 --> 00:01:58,718
15 deep out the door so i didn't feel

67
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:00,640
like waiting that i kept driving

68
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:01,759
yeah they must be having a sale or

69
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,960
something in there wow

70
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:06,640
it's just a saturday bro oh yeah

71
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:08,239
it's weird when one shop right down the

72
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,679
street has all the people and there are

73
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,680
two or three shops on the way with

74
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,878
no people you're like well that's the

75
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,280
shop that works they should probably

76
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:15,120
just

77
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,280
kind of consolidate all those other

78
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,280
shops or something

79
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,039
the market will get there eventually it

80
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,000
does that yes it does we saw we watched

81
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:24,479
that happen in denver

82
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,759
when the uh broadster dam the broadway

83
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:27,439
avenue boom happened there was a

84
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:29,840
dispensary every block it was

85
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:31,519
dispensary and a starbucks every block

86
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,200
and then all the starbucks survived but

87
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,159
half of those dispensaries disappeared

88
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:36,639
quite quickly

89
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:38,000
yep well they all became a different

90
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:40,479
chain dispensary

91
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,318
yes yes they were all eaten up all right

92
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:44,399
we're gonna get ourselves back on track

93
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:46,479
uh since you were polite enough to ask i

94
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,400
am smoking garlic banger live batter

95
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:50,000
tonight i love those garlicky terps

96
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,080
it's got a nice mellow buzz that's why

97
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,080
maybe i'm a little bit slower than usual

98
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,200
i know i'm kind of slow all the time

99
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,360
dude it is so good

100
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:58,719
it settles me down it's like nice winter

101
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,480
concentrates it's like

102
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:01,919
a savory thanksgiving meal so it's

103
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:03,439
perfect for this time of year

104
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:05,199
it's been gone for a long time i haven't

105
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:06,878
been able to find it or get it so i am

106
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:09,598

the density but it's also really dry

131

00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,199
it they didn't seem to care like just

162
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,240
young bud tender girls but they were

163
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,759
kind of confused

164
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,040
they sold me my quarter and i was happy

165
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,879
with it i've been puffing on it

166

167

168
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:47,439
snob but having these bowls around when

169
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:49,199
you're

170
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:50,719
talking when i get you going i love to

171
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,319
have something with my hands and smoke

172
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,080
in this bowl is definitely going to

173
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:56,240
help with my attention span it will give

174
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:57,680
me more time to let you talk and

175
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,319
not feel like i got to jump in there so

176
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,000
much dabs are great but they take a

177
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:04,319
minute

178
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,240
and it's a also it takes a minute to

179
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:08,000
recover so like i'm on a podcast and i

180
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,400
do a big ripper of a dab in the next two

181
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,839
minutes is just life going

182
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:13,839
in my head and you're talking and i've

183
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:15,758
got an audience and a camera and these

184
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:16,719
lights bro they make dabs four times

185
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,800
more intense

186
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,160
uh i'm i'm serious that these lights

187
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,360
just you're just like oh it's okay guys

188
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,680
i'm just really high

189
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,199
take all these lights off me once you

190
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,199
get used to it it's cool but man that's

191
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:30,080
a lot of light for a dab

192
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,520
yeah i've uh spent some time in front of

193
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:33,120
these lights trying to get used to them

194
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,839
when i first turned them on i was like i

195
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,519
bought the wrong

196
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:38,959
too powerful light rig no yeah i'm

197
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:40,719
more comfortable than i was when they

198
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:42,239
showed up a few days ago it takes a

199
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,520
minute to adjust i'm kind of comfortable

200
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,038
on these lights now i love changing the

201
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:46,000
color behind me and playing with these

202
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:47,519
lights i'm getting the temperature of

203
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,279
the light color dialed in

204
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:51,439
i'm using this easier when it was just

205
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:53,599
audio that's for sure oh wasn't it

206
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:55,038
i'm not using the 4k camera today so i'm

207
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,800
just on the macbook since we're zooming

208
00:05:55,038 --> 00:05:57,599
so i do apologize i'm not in the lovely

209
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,439
4k

210
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,680
i did notice that i recorded a really

211
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:03,279
nice 4k video i posted it up to youtube

212
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,959
and then youtube took it and squished it

213
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:06,079
down and made it a shitty compression

214
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:09,198
file

215
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:10,240
ah man that was frustrating

216
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,160
i don't know what i clicked i don't know

217
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,360
what i did wrong i loaded it up as 4k i

218
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,600
was pretty sure but

219
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,360
uh we did not get 4k out of that bad

220
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,199
[ __ ] but that's how it went oh well

221

thought it was rude so i didn't record

327
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,680
it because

328
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:21,600

00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:24,079
wife and be like hey passed down and

330

00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,360
never missed a show

542
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,720
i think it's closer to six or seven to

543
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,159
tell you the truth i could look in the

544
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,519
phone i've got the exact date in the

545
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:40,000
phone somewhere but i don't want to

546
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,360
scroll through

547
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,600
while we're on here and i've got the

548
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,680
show notes on the phone so

549
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,519
um we do have a purpose there is a

550
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:49,120
method to the madness we have gathered

551
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,799
here today for a real reason

552
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,799
uh no it's not a wedding it is not a

553
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:55,039
funeral uh there has been

554
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:56,000
some news that i don't completely

555
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:58,240
understand

556
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,679
and social media definitely doesn't

557
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,959
completely understand and i thought that

558
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:02,319
if i don't understand it and social

559
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:04,159
media doesn't understand it

560
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,680
there's a large portion of my audience

561
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:06,399
that doesn't understand it i hate to

562
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:08,958
admit

563
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:10,720
that i am uh politically ignorant i

564
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:12,000
didn't get into politics i didn't care

565
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,720
about politics

566
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,759
until [ __ ] obviously right cannabis

567
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,320
legalization

568
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,600
luckily i met mike and i got involved in

569
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,240
a dispensary

570
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,399
that had political issues the owner of

571
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,839
that dispensary had legal and political

572
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:28,799
issues

573
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:29,519
i met mike mike kind of showed me how to

574
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:31,198
handle

575
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:32,480
political issues and develop my own

576
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:33,599
opinions and thoughts around these

577
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,278
political things with the little

578
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,600
information that i've got

579
00:16:35,278 --> 00:16:39,919
um so i didn't care about politics and

580
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,278
like legalization of anything i didn't

581
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:43,198
think it mattered but now that

582
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:44,720
uh i'm involved in the cannabis industry

583
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:46,240
now that i'm a i'm kind of i've got a

584
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,278
business i've got multiple companies i'm

585
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,360
a tax payer

586
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:51,039
citizen yeah it took me now i understand

587
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,519
why people care so much the decisions

588
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:53,838
that

589
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:55,278
those people make heavily affect my

590
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,120
today my tomorrow

591
00:16:55,278 --> 00:16:59,439
and more importantly probably the

592
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,759
decisions made today by our leaders are

593
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:04,000
going to affect me mostly in 5 to 10

594
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:05,360
15 years is what i'm starting to learn

595
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,078
and that's when i'm not going to be old

596
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,838
enough to

597
00:17:06,078 --> 00:17:09,519
[ __ ] bounce back and recover and just

598
00:17:07,838 --> 00:17:10,879
say sorry i'll just work harder and make

599
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:12,318
more money next month i'll be like i'm

600
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,760
[ __ ] old i'm retired

601
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:15,119
and now i'm [ __ ] that's how it's going

602
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:17,119
to be if i don't stay on top of it so i

603
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,879
started paying more attention

604
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,798
but i don't understand completely what

605
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,319
is going on with this bill i don't

606
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:24,318
understand how it all works

607
00:17:22,318 --> 00:17:25,599
i know that mike does i know there's a

608
00:17:24,318 --> 00:17:26,558
lot of my people out there listening

609
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,838
that are already

610
00:17:26,558 --> 00:17:29,359
saying i don't even need to listen i

611
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:30,639
understand this better than mike but

612
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:32,000
still hang out with us you guys because

613
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,440
you may learn something we want your

614
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,519
feedback let me know how we did on this

615
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:38,558
but mike i'm gonna quit rambling

616
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:40,960
and let's talk about um the thing called

617
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:43,119
the more act it is a house bill it just

618
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,759
recently was voted on

619
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:47,519
um so i guess my first question is what

620
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:51,679
happened

621
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:53,279
okay so the uh house of representatives

622
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:55,038
is one half of congress there's the

623
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:57,279
house and the senate

624
00:17:55,038 --> 00:18:00,000
um the house of representatives has a

625
00:17:57,279 --> 00:18:02,639
whole truckload of people in it

626
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,720
the senate only two senators per state

627
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,080
so there's total of 100 senators there's

628
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,160
way more people in the house

629
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:09,759
representatives the house of

630
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,440
representatives just voted on what

631
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:13,599
they're calling the moore act

632
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,279
it's an acronym for the marijuana

633
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:19,119
opportunity reinvestment

634
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:24,639
and expungement act of 2019

635
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:24,639
or the short the more act of 2019

636
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:30,798
it removes or if it's passed into law

637
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:33,279
eventually it would remove

638
00:18:30,798 --> 00:18:34,720
um marijuana from the controlled

639
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:36,960
substances act

640
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,160
um completely deschedule cannabis

641
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:41,440
federally

642
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,240
leaving um what to do about cannabis

643
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,080
legality

644
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:49,919
strictly up to the states sort of how

645
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:52,639
alcohol is now where you talk and say we

646
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:55,759
want state license stores only

647
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:58,799
in three two beer and places like

648
00:18:55,759 --> 00:19:00,640
california you can get vodka at 7-eleven

649
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:02,240
like it just totally leaves it up to the

650
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,400
states

651
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,759
the more act also does a couple other

652
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:09,360
things

653
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:11,038
it would set a five percent federal tax

654
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:13,199
on cannabis

655
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:14,720
some of that money would go into a trust

656
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,640
fund for

657
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,319
various areas that were harmed by the

658
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,240
war on drugs

659
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:22,720
other portions of that money would go to

660
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,880
the small business administration

661
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,759
which would have loans and services

662
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:29,200
available

663
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:32,960
for startup cannabis businesses just

664
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:36,319
like they do for all other businesses

665
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:38,000
it would prohibit the denial of federal

666
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:40,639
public benefits to a person

667
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,640
on the basis of certain cannabis related

668
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,799
conduct or convictions

669
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,720
and prohibit the denial of benefits and

670
00:19:44,798 --> 00:19:47,839
protections under immigration laws like

671
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,279
right now

672
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:51,279
if you're canadian and you've been

673
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:52,240
arrested for having pot and gotten a

674
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:54,399
ticket for it

675
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,240
back before it was legal in canada and

676
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,120
you try to come to the u.s and they say

677
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,640
have you ever been

678
00:19:57,119 --> 00:20:02,798
charged with a cannabis crime and you

679
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:06,480
say yes you don't get to come to the u.s

680
00:20:02,798 --> 00:20:08,158
it's a super obnoxious rule if the more

681
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,558
act gets passed into law

682
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:12,159
that's history too so there's a lot of

683
00:20:10,558 --> 00:20:16,079
good stuff here there's some less

684
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:18,720
good stuff um like anything congress

685
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:20,240
does they got to [ __ ] it up a little bit

686
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,480
but for the most part this is a pretty

687
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,839
good bill um it's a huge step in the

688
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,159
right direction

689
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:28,959
um neither part of congress the house or

690
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:32,559
the senate has ever voted on something

691
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:35,759
this sweeping as far as cannabis goes

692
00:20:32,558 --> 00:20:37,038
so it is quite historic even if it

693
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:39,679
doesn't go anywhere

694
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:41,679
which is very likely all right that's

695
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:43,519
the negative side of this story

696
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:44,798
so the positive side is it's a pretty

697
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:47,119
good bill

698
00:20:44,798 --> 00:20:48,720
it's historic in what it does and how

699
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:52,239
far it goes

700
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:54,558
but government

701
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,640
um so the house of representatives has

702
00:20:54,558 --> 00:21:00,158
voted and passed it

703
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:02,000
now the senate has to the senate is

704
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:05,440
currently controlled by mitch mcconnell

705
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:08,558
[ __ ] you kentucky um

706
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:10,159
and yeah i meant that uh

707
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:11,599
i'm i'm not going to edit it out you're

708
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:14,320
going to get hate mail me

709
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:16,719
that's fine send hate mail to at nemo

710
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:19,759
punk 15.

711
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:24,000
twitter so

712
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:26,400
um here's where we stand now with the

713
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,519
more act and federal descheduling of

714
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,840
cannabis

715
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:32,960
the house has passed it right now the

716
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:34,798
senate can choose to take it up or not

717
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,558
for the bill to move forward at all the

718
00:21:34,798 --> 00:21:37,279
senate would have to choose to vote on

719
00:21:36,558 --> 00:21:40,720
it

720
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:42,720
and pass it right now like i mentioned

721
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,000
the earlier there's a hundred senators

722
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,120
total right

723
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:50,480
now they're divided along a 52 to 48

724
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:51,759
split there's 52 republicans 48

725
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:56,159
democrats

726
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:58,400
which brings us to georgia the georgia

727
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,840
senate race is currently in a runoff

728
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,440
election

729
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:05,199
it looks like it's going to be the most

730
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:06,880
expensive senate race in history

731
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,798
both sides are pouring money into

732
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:11,039
georgia right now attempting to lock

733
00:22:08,798 --> 00:22:13,519
down those two senate seats

734
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:16,240
because those senate seats will either

735
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:17,440
lead to a continuation of the 52-48

736
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,839
split

737
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,640
in favor of the republicans or lead to

738
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:24,399
an even

739
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:27,360
50-50 split republican and democrat

740
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:29,280
if both of the georgia senate seats go

741
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:32,479
to democrats

742
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:33,519
is the only way the more act goes

743
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:37,038
through the senate

744
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:39,279
is the conventional wisdom right now um

745
00:22:37,038 --> 00:22:41,119
i i'm not positive what the two

746
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:42,399
republicans running for those seats have

747
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:45,119
said about cannabis

748
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:48,559
but in general the republican party has

749
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:51,359
not at all been supportive here

750
00:22:48,558 --> 00:22:52,558
when the moore act passed in the house i

751
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:57,599
think only five or

752
00:22:52,558 --> 00:22:57,599
ten republicans voted for it um

753
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:03,120
just it's not popular among republican

754
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:05,840
elected representatives that just hap is

755
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:09,918
just how it is in the u.s right now

756
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:10,879
so uh if this goes forward we need the

757
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:12,799
senate in

758
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,400
the two georgia seats and senate to both

759
00:23:12,798 --> 00:23:18,480
go democrat

760
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:21,038
and then the senate to choose to uh

761
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:23,120
read the more act and vote on it and

762
00:23:21,038 --> 00:23:25,519
then if it passes in the senate it's

763
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:28,558
likely to be a 50 50 tie

764
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:31,679
which would mean the vice president

765
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:33,519
settles the tiebreaker and

766
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:35,280
in the way everything looks to be

767
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:37,759
playing out right now that would be

768
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:39,038
the sponsor of this act vice

769
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:42,480
president-elect harris

770
00:23:39,038 --> 00:23:45,440
so it's a really really long shot that

771
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:48,000
this bill goes anywhere

772
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,960
it's only likely path to getting signed

773
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,359
by the president

774
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,440
is if georgia goes to blue senate seats

775
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:56,879
which is super unlikely

776
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:58,880
and then we happen to get a 50-50 tie

777
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,080
and then the vice president-elect

778
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:03,200
chooses to vote

779
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:07,119
with the democrats like it's a long

780
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:08,960
long road but where we are right now

781
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:11,038
is still definitely worth celebrating

782
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,759
because it's never happened before and a

783
00:24:11,038 --> 00:24:14,158
lot of people

784
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:14,879
never thought it would happen period all

785
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:17,039
right

786
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,799
did all that make sense that all made

787
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:20,240
mostly made sense to me yeah i think

788
00:24:18,798 --> 00:24:21,839
there was a lot of information there

789
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,200
well you covered all of my i had three

790
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:24,720
questions is what the hell happened

791
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,519
what's going to happen next

792
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,798
um and then i think you worked too close

793
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:30,798
to my third question is

794
00:24:28,798 --> 00:24:32,079
what happens if this works do we want

795
00:24:30,798 --> 00:24:33,440
this i know we do want federal

796
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:35,119
legalization but

797
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,038
what if this does go through mike how

798
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:38,639
does how does how do things change

799
00:24:37,038 --> 00:24:41,278
for us how do things change for our

800
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:44,960
dispensary worker friends

801
00:24:41,278 --> 00:24:47,759
um the change will be slow um

802
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:49,519
so right now colorado already has a ton

803
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:52,480
of rules in place

804
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:53,839
for our cannabis industry and none of

805
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:58,558
them would change

806
00:24:53,839 --> 00:25:01,839
um right now i guess the anti-pops

807
00:24:58,558 --> 00:25:03,278
movement's best hope is that the federal

808
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:06,000
government will remember

809
00:25:03,278 --> 00:25:07,919
that cannabis is illegal federally and

810
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,798
technically every marijuana business in

811
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:12,320
the country

812
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:14,079
is violating federal law and at any

813
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:17,278
point the department of justice

814
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:19,038
or the dea or any of those bureaucratic

815
00:25:17,278 --> 00:25:22,159
agencies could decide to

816
00:25:19,038 --> 00:25:24,000
just decimate our industry and if the

817
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:28,080
more act passes

818
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:31,919
that threat goes away okay um

819
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:33,439
all of a sudden 280e the really horrible

820
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:36,320
tax bill

821
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:38,159
that says because cannabis is a schedule

822
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:41,519
one narcotic

823
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:44,000
we can't deduct payroll normal business

824
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:46,798
expenses from federal taxes

825
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:50,400
that goes away cannabis gets descheduled

826
00:25:46,798 --> 00:25:53,599
it's no longer a schedule one narcotic

827
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:57,600
280e doesn't apply anymore um so

828
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:59,678
this bill has the potential to have

829
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:00,719
major implications across the cannabis

830
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:03,440
industry

831
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,400
um if we can make those deductions i

832
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,679
mean that's

833
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,278
health insurance that's where the health

834
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:08,798
insurance money goes that's where the

835
00:26:07,278 --> 00:26:10,880
payroll money goes

836
00:26:08,798 --> 00:26:12,079
it's all going to federal taxes we can

837
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:15,840
use it regularly

838
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:20,158
anymore yep banking gets better yeah

839
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:22,879
business loans just like normal um

840
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:24,000
you recently ran into a thing where you

841
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,559
had trouble with banking

842
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,519
stuff yes that all those headaches go

843
00:26:26,558 --> 00:26:29,200
away for people

844
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:31,519
yeah all they have to do is type in they

845
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,440
can go to the uh colorado marijuana

846
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:34,879

848
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,360

849
00:26:36,558 --> 00:26:38,879
badge

850
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:40,479
if you're going to the bank to apply for

851
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,400
a loan or for a bank account you have to

852
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,839
give them your social security number

853
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,679
they can type that in and that will pop

854
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:47,119
up right on the med website and it tells

855
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:49,440
you right away that person is

856
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:50,879
and mine says right there was clear on

857
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,640
the screen she showed it to me that you

858
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,720
have this badge and i was like oh yeah

859
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:56,480
so that messed with my banking had to do

860
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:59,839
some hoops

861
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:03,120
yep it uh uh

862
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:07,278
our cannabis laws in this country have

863
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:11,119
sort of infected everything

864
00:27:07,278 --> 00:27:13,200
prohibition was such a bad concept and

865
00:27:11,119 --> 00:27:14,798
the people in power so desperately

866
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:18,080
wanted it to work that they kept

867
00:27:14,798 --> 00:27:20,879
trying and kept trying and kept trying

868
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:22,319
and so it's it's literally affected

869
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,559
everything it's affected public

870
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:26,639
assistance it's affected housing it's

871
00:27:24,558 --> 00:27:29,519
affected scholarships it's affected

872
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:32,880
education it's affected policing

873
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:35,918
it's affected retirement programs and

874
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:37,760
how police operate and the

875
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:39,840
public's relationship with the police

876
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:42,879
and this bill is a

877
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:47,119
major major step towards

878
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:50,080
undoing a lot of that nice and

879
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:51,119
um if this bill gets passed it's not

880
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:53,278
like all that's

881
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:54,398
over tomorrow or the day after it's

882
00:27:53,278 --> 00:27:57,519
passed

883
00:27:54,398 --> 00:27:59,278
uh it's just a good first or a good next

884
00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:00,240
step not a good first step a good next

885
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:03,679

media posts

911
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:58,559
trying to get votes on the morax stopped

912
00:28:56,558 --> 00:29:00,480
project sam the nation's big

913
00:28:58,558 --> 00:29:03,440
anti-cannabis group

914
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:05,278
uh is claiming victory for getting the

915
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:07,038
vote delayed till now

916
00:29:05,278 --> 00:29:09,038
they were gonna vote on it before the

917
00:29:07,038 --> 00:29:10,158
november elections and it got delayed

918
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:12,398
till after

919
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:13,840
purposefully that's not a victory that's

920
00:29:12,398 --> 00:29:16,079
a delay

921
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:17,359
yeah it uh it's the only that's the only

922
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:20,960
victories they get

923
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:22,798
um so uh they lost pretty big on

924
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,319
election night five more states joined

925
00:29:22,798 --> 00:29:26,319

926
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:28,000

928
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,839
prolonging your defeat give it up

929
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:33,440
generation dreadlocks has taken over

930
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:36,398
dude

931
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,840
they drive me nuts because i mean we

932
00:29:36,398 --> 00:29:40,558
really have moved past

933
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:41,599
are we gonna legalize it are we not that

934
00:29:40,558 --> 00:29:44,240
cat's out the bag

935
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:45,199
it ain't going back in i don't want a

936
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,960
lot of things

937
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,640
but if you tell me i can't have them

938
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,919
[ __ ] you no i want them that's just how

939
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,440
life works and that's i feel like that's

940
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:52,799
what prohibition does to things if you

941
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,320
put a red button right there

942
00:29:52,798 --> 00:29:56,720
i don't care about the red button if you

943
00:29:54,319 --> 00:29:57,599
put do not press this red button on the

944
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,960
button

945
00:29:57,599 --> 00:30:00,639
when you walk away i'm going to press it

946
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,558
now every day

947
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,759
yeah yeah and that's prohibition works

948
00:30:02,558 --> 00:30:05,440
the same way dude if it wasn't

949
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:06,319
prohibited and treated like something we

950
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,480
can't have

951
00:30:06,319 --> 00:30:10,398
it wouldn't be such a big deal and yeah

952
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,759
just legalize it federally everywhere

953
00:30:10,398 --> 00:30:15,439
let us do what we want

954
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:15,440
we're adults we can do our thing

955
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,278
it's time it's really really time and

956
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:20,799
there's

957
00:30:19,278 --> 00:30:23,038
i don't think there's any set of

958
00:30:20,798 --> 00:30:26,398
circumstances that lead

959
00:30:23,038 --> 00:30:28,158
to a major reversal reversal nationally

960
00:30:26,398 --> 00:30:31,359
on cannabis policy

961
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:33,520
it's it's too widespread it's too common

962
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:35,359
it's too popular it's too embraced and

963
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:38,240
it's too ingrained now

964
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:39,759
but uh the anti-group still hasn't

965
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,120
figured this out and so instead of

966
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:43,200
joining the conversation

967
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:45,119
and helping us make smart workable

968
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:48,240
regulations they're still

969
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:48,639
being obstinate in fighting tooth and

970
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,759
nail

971
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:53,360
every step of progress so it is what it

972
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:55,200
is they're definitely making those calls

973
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:56,879
they care a lot they make 15

974
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,319
20 calls a day they send out a [ __ ] ton

975
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,320
of emails

976
00:30:58,319 --> 00:31:01,599
um but i say it all the time the

977
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:04,960
cannabis community's

978
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:08,158
the largest voting block in the u.s

979
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:10,880
we would all just focus for a minute and

980
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:13,200
unify in any way we could dominate

981
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:15,120
politics for the next 30 years

982
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,960
and right now is a really easy

983
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:17,759
opportunity to shoot an email at your

984

00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,640
really good podcast we gave him a lot of

1036
00:32:55,278 --> 00:32:57,839
good rambles we gave him some good

1037
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,080
political talk

1038
00:32:57,839 --> 00:33:01,278
you only said one thing he only said one

1039
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:02,558
thing that's going to piss a few people

1040
00:33:01,278 --> 00:33:03,359
off and i think that's going to go over

1041
00:33:02,558 --> 00:33:06,798
well

1042
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:08,798
it's just how it's i would i really

1043
00:33:06,798 --> 00:33:10,720
understand when people ask to say this

1044
00:33:08,798 --> 00:33:13,599
is a cannabis show i'd like to keep the

1045
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:15,839
politics out of cannabis but

1046
00:33:13,599 --> 00:33:17,918
it's cannabis news education and

1047
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:20,240
conversation we exist in the world

1048
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:21,120
politics is part of the world that is it

1049
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,038
and if

1050
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:24,158
people are in jail for consuming

1051
00:33:23,038 --> 00:33:26,158
cannabis and we can

1052
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:27,760
help that not be a thing i don't think

1053
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:29,278
anybody should ever go to jail for

1054
00:33:27,759 --> 00:33:29,759
consuming a plant that grew out of the

1055
00:33:29,278 --> 00:33:31,119
ground

1056
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:32,398
i think you should be able i'm not going

1057
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:34,079
to go too far you should be able to do

1058
00:33:32,398 --> 00:33:35,759
what you want it's along as long as what

1059
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:37,759
you're doing doesn't hurt me or the

1060
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:39,278
earth or cause any crazy ripples

1061
00:33:37,759 --> 00:33:41,038
do your thing if you want to smoke

1062
00:33:39,278 --> 00:33:41,599
whatever if you want to smoke battery

1063
00:33:41,038 --> 00:33:43,759
acid

1064
00:33:41,599 --> 00:33:45,678
and [ __ ] bleach have a good time

1065
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:47,119
buddy i just don't do it in my backyard

1066
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:47,759
where i got to deal with you and we're

1067
00:33:47,119 --> 00:33:49,599
cool

1068
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:51,038
um so yeah i think we should all be able

1069
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:52,879
to do what we want and

1070
00:33:51,038 --> 00:33:54,480
that's part of if they make rules that

1071
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,679
let us not able to do that we've got to

1072
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,038
speak up that's part of them i've got a

1073
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:57,919
platform i got a microphone i got a

1074
00:33:57,038 --> 00:33:59,519
smart friend

1075
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:01,360
i would be doing a disservice if i

1076
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:02,960
didn't come on here and say we got a job

1077
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:04,240
to do that's part of my job not just to

1078
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,079
teach you how to grow but

1079
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,759
then more people can grow like there

1080
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:08,960
will be more cannabis around more

1081
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:10,719
illegal cannabis

1082
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,398
better cannabis that's part of my goal

1083
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,959
is to get better cannabis out there for

1084
00:34:12,398 --> 00:34:14,559
everybody

1085
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,480
yeah if it's legal you don't have to

1086
00:34:14,559 --> 00:34:18,000
[ __ ] drive from your house to your

1087
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,519
buddy's house to get in their car and

1088
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,280
then drive to the groce store in their

1089
00:34:19,519 --> 00:34:22,960
car and then go drive around the block a

1090
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,079
few times and drive the long way home so

1091
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,838
no one's following you

1092
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:27,119
drive that car into the garage unload

1093
00:34:25,838 --> 00:34:29,119
all this [ __ ] into your car in the

1094
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:30,480
garage then drive your car home

1095
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:31,760
and take the long way home so you know

1096
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,199
no one's you don't have to play all

1097
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,560
those dumb games anymore you go to the

1098
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:36,000
grocery you buy what you need

1099
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:37,838
you can go home and set up your tent you

1100
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,878
grow like a pro that's what we're trying

1101
00:34:37,838 --> 00:34:40,799
to do

1102
00:34:38,878 --> 00:34:43,039
all right it uh everything's better when

1103
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:46,639
it's legal y'all everything's better

1104
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:48,719
except the taxes is there okay the taxes

1105
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:50,320
but that's expected is there a downside

1106
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:52,000
if this does pass i've got

1107
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,440
my own suspicions and fears that i don't

1108
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,039
want to open up those cans of worms on

1109
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:57,039
this episode but is there a possible

1110
00:34:55,039 --> 00:35:00,159
downside

1111
00:34:57,039 --> 00:35:01,039
uh i need to read which amendments were

1112
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:04,000
passed

1113
00:35:01,039 --> 00:35:06,719
with it right now worrying about a

1114
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:09,920
downside is silly because

1115
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:12,559
the downside to how the law exists

1116
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,760
currently is far greater than the

1117
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:16,799
downside

1118
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:19,920
that would exist if the law changed

1119
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:21,599
um but there was an amendment offered to

1120
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,000
it i don't remember if it passed or not

1121
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:25,359
i

1122
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:28,960
think it did but not a hundred percent

1123
00:35:25,358 --> 00:35:31,519
that uh sort of like colorado's barring

1124
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:33,440
people that have been convicted of drug

1125
00:35:31,519 --> 00:35:37,679
and cannabis crimes

1126
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:40,320
um and that's really [ __ ] up

1127
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:42,719
yeah that uh that puts out some of the

1128
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,720
best talent

1129
00:35:42,838 --> 00:35:45,838
conversation

1130
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:48,800
it was part of the conversation when

1131
00:35:45,838 --> 00:35:51,519
colorado and washington first went legal

1132
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:54,320
we specifically banned any one of the

1133
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:57,199
anyone that had gotten in trouble before

1134
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:58,000
because we were selling an idea that

1135
00:35:57,199 --> 00:36:01,199
scared the [ __ ]

1136
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,559
out of white america and they're a lot

1137
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:04,399
less scared now

1138
00:36:02,559 --> 00:36:06,480
in a lot of states that have the

1139
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,838
conversations evolved drastically in the

1140
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,760
states that have legalized since

1141
00:36:07,838 --> 00:36:13,199
colorado and washington

1142
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:15,359
to where the legal industries should be

1143
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:17,358
inclusive of everybody that was

1144
00:36:15,358 --> 00:36:18,719
um involved in the industry before it

1145
00:36:17,358 --> 00:36:21,199
was legal

1146
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:24,319
but in colorado still the the five and

1147
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:26,799
ten year ban exists

1148
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:28,160
and the there was an amendment offered

1149
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,640
to the moore act that

1150
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:32,559
continued that federally um i don't

1151
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:34,319
remember what the specifics of it though

1152
00:36:32,559 --> 00:36:37,759
where i'd have to triple check

1153
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:40,160
so there's likely to be some not great

1154
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:42,160
undercurrents to this if it goes all the

1155
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:45,118
way through to passage

1156
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:47,039
but that's a really long journey and

1157
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:50,800
there's plenty of time between now

1158
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:52,639
and then for edits okay so yep

1159
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,560

1160
00:36:52,639 --> 00:36:55,920
hate or you can't live with

1161
00:36:54,559 --> 00:36:58,400

1167
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,599
of learning to do still mike i'm glad

1168
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:11,039
you're around to teach me about politics

1169
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:12,720
and the processes

1170
00:37:11,039 --> 00:37:14,480
when i was in school pros and everything

1171
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:17,679
bro do they did not teach me

1172
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,679
any of this stuff in school

1173
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:23,279
yeah some schools try some schools don't

1174
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,280
and i don't know which school you went

1175
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:27,440
to i don't want to just

1176
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:29,359
i do pueblo is too small for us to [ __ ]

1177
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:31,039
on one of those schools

1178
00:37:29,358 --> 00:37:32,319
southern california schooling is when i

1179
00:37:31,039 --> 00:37:33,920
should have learned about this like in

1180
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:35,519
school in those grades is when i should

1181
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:38,240
have learned this part and i didn't get

1182
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:38,559
yeah they were i think seventh and

1183
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:41,598
eighth

1184
00:37:38,559 --> 00:37:43,039
are usually when people win civics but

1185
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:45,200
uh

1186
00:37:43,039 --> 00:37:46,079
i mean there's a huge when you look at

1187
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:48,799
who votes

1188
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:50,000
in the vote totals even in this last

1189
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,640
election where turnout

1190
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,159
was as high as it's ever been if you add

1191
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:57,118
up

1192
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:58,319
trump's score and biden's score and all

1193
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:59,680
of the other people that ran for

1194
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,280
president's score

1195
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:02,719
and then you compare that to the total

1196
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,320
number of americans

1197
00:38:02,719 --> 00:38:05,759
the total number of voters is way

1198
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:08,480
[ __ ] smaller

1199
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:09,040
and it's it's complicated it's hard to

1200
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:12,000
follow

1201
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:13,279
it's annoying it's super frustrating the

1202
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,039
idea of compromise

1203
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:16,480
[ __ ] with a lot of people's cognitive

1204
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:19,199
dissonance and

1205
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:20,559
yeah it's it's understandable a lot of

1206
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:22,078
people don't follow this a lot of people

1207
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:24,799
don't want to follow it

1208
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:25,440
and that's what i'm here for eventually

1209
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,440
nightmare

1210
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:29,200
gives me like a it's not a headache but

1211
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:31,119
it's just like a

1212
00:38:29,199 --> 00:38:32,559
i don't i just i'm done hearing about it

1213
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:34,320
and it doesn't make sense and

1214
00:38:32,559 --> 00:38:36,159
that guy's an [ __ ] that guy's lying

1215
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:37,920
that guy's cool but nobody likes him

1216
00:38:36,159 --> 00:38:39,598
like just i don't know just it just

1217
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,639
dried it's like a [ __ ] giant soap op

1218
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:42,320
right now it used to be

1219
00:38:40,639 --> 00:38:45,118
it felt more political now it feels kind

1220
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:47,200
of soap operating it's like wwf or wwe

1221
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:49,599
or whatever they call it now

1222
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:51,439
i i wasn't joking a couple episodes ago

1223
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:52,800
when i said my superpower is

1224
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:55,358
sort of being able to sit through these

1225
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:58,800
meetings and not lose my mind

1226
00:38:55,358 --> 00:39:00,239
um i remember sitting at city council

1227
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,200
and i was looking at stuff in front of

1228
00:39:00,239 --> 00:39:03,598
me

1229
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:04,239
and it said very clearly like on line

1230
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:05,599
one

1231
00:39:04,239 --> 00:39:07,519
that we were going to have zero

1232
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:09,440
marijuana businesses

1233
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:11,440
and then down on line 20 it said we

1234
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:13,838
could expect half a million dollars from

1235
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:17,039
our marijuana businesses

1236
00:39:13,838 --> 00:39:19,519
and no one else in their hearing no one

1237
00:39:17,039 --> 00:39:21,279
else in the room there's like 50 adults

1238
00:39:19,519 --> 00:39:23,039
no one else picks up on this and then

1239
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,560
they ask for public comment and i was

1240
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:27,599
like

1241
00:39:24,559 --> 00:39:28,880
i got some comments am i the only one in

1242
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:30,720
the room that's

1243
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:32,720
high enough to do math still like what

1244
00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:35,679
the [ __ ] is happening

1245
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:36,159
and yeah the that two nights later is

1246
00:39:35,679 --> 00:39:38,078
when

1247
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:39,838
one of the city and city council people

1248
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:40,640
told me hey i'm gonna step down next

1249
00:39:39,838 --> 00:39:43,838
week

1250
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:45,279
you should try to take my seat and

1251
00:39:43,838 --> 00:39:47,679
if you're able to sit through this and

1252
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:49,519
follow the thread like

1253
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:50,960
you can conquer the world basically it's

1254
00:39:49,519 --> 00:39:52,239
creepy yeah

1255
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,760
that's not i'm glad you're there for

1256
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:55,039
that mike maya i was at a meeting a

1257
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,960
couple of days ago

1258
00:39:55,039 --> 00:39:58,480
and my brain hit that point i was like

1259
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:00,880
is this done yet because i am

1260
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:02,639
like just you know it's probably as a

1261
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:04,160
former cigarette smoker there's probably

1262
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:04,879
about that 40 minute mark i can see it

1263
00:40:04,159 --> 00:40:06,799

1264
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:08,000

1268
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:15,920
built that

1269
00:40:13,199 --> 00:40:17,039
nicotine program in my brain yeah the uh

1270
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,440
the person on the other side of the

1271
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:18,800
table

1272
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:20,400
i think they caught on because they go

1273
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,599

let's go like i'm done one of the things

1283
00:40:36,639 --> 00:40:41,118
that always made me laugh is at the

1284
00:40:38,318 --> 00:40:44,079
start of the meeting the room is packed

1285
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:45,358
standing room only there's 18 20 people

1286
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:46,960
standing up

1287
00:40:45,358 --> 00:40:48,480
sometimes there's six or ten people in

1288
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:52,159
the hallway

1289
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:54,000
and usually 20 minutes into the meeting

1290
00:40:52,159 --> 00:40:55,838
the only people left in the room are

1291
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,960
required by law to be there

1292
00:40:55,838 --> 00:41:01,599
being paid to be there or

00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:55,838
get a little more restrictive right now

1322
00:41:54,639 --> 00:41:58,639
as we go into the

1323
00:41:55,838 --> 00:42:00,239
deeper parts of winter so all of these

1324
00:41:58,639 --> 00:42:01,679
things are happening online even if

1325
00:42:00,239 --> 00:42:04,000
you're part of the world they re

1326
00:42:01,679 --> 00:42:06,000
we're resistant to that for a minute so

1327
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,280
take the time to figure out when your

1328
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,239
city your town or

1329
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:11,040
whatever meets on zoom and check those

1330
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:12,799
meetings out

1331
00:42:11,039 --> 00:42:15,679
figure out where you can add your two

1332
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,000
cents maybe it's an email maybe it's an

1333
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:17,679
issue

1334
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,440
that you care about maybe it's not even

1335
00:42:17,679 --> 00:42:21,199
cannabis related but

1336
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:22,720
if more people were involved [ __ ] would

1337
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:24,559
be better oh yeah

1338
00:42:22,719 --> 00:42:26,239
yep yeah because they don't all have the

1339
00:42:24,559 --> 00:42:27,519
same idea as us they're living a

1340
00:42:26,239 --> 00:42:29,199
different lifestyle than us

1341
00:42:27,519 --> 00:42:30,639
and yeah they don't think about us when

1342
00:42:29,199 --> 00:42:32,639
they make their decisions a lot of them

1343
00:42:30,639 --> 00:42:34,480
i can't generalize like that that's uh

1344
00:42:32,639 --> 00:42:36,639
what is that councilmanism it can't be

1345
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:40,079
canceled council personist

1346
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:42,400
it uh one of the things that i like to

1347
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:43,119
try to remind myself is everybody on the

1348
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,519
planet

1349
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:46,318
has just as rich and interesting life as

1350
00:42:45,519 --> 00:42:49,679
me

1351
00:42:46,318 --> 00:42:51,599
like i just don't know about it yet but

1352
00:42:49,679 --> 00:42:53,358
everybody's got their own [ __ ] going on

1353
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:55,440
and

1354
00:42:53,358 --> 00:42:57,199
use that to your advantage man relate to

1355
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:58,800
people they're they relate to you too

1356
00:42:57,199 --> 00:43:00,318
even if you don't think you do

1357
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,599
like when you went to city council you

1358
00:43:00,318 --> 00:43:03,519
made an impression even though you

1359
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:04,640
didn't feel like you belonged there feel

1360
00:43:03,519 --> 00:43:07,199
comfortable there

1361
00:43:04,639 --> 00:43:09,039
when i had 10 or 15 people behind me i

1362
00:43:07,199 --> 00:43:09,759
had those city council people [ __ ]

1363
00:43:09,039 --> 00:43:12,400
bricks

1364
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:15,839
yeah they do not want somebody with the

1365
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:17,760
ability to bring friends to the meeting

1366
00:43:15,838 --> 00:43:19,279
hell out of elected officials they

1367
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:20,640
definitely knew that our little cheering

1368
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,319
section there was there to support

1369
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:23,199
medical cannabis they definitely

1370
00:43:22,318 --> 00:43:25,519
understood that

1371
00:43:23,199 --> 00:43:27,039
yep and i was completely i was

1372
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:28,719
professional and respectful and all i

1373
00:43:27,039 --> 00:43:31,119
had to do was show up and smile

1374
00:43:28,719 --> 00:43:32,719
and we we did make a presence so that

1375
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:34,880
that does work

1376
00:43:32,719 --> 00:43:36,480
dude when this started i never thought

1377
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:38,880
we'd be here

1378
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:39,760
and it looks like we might seriously see

1379
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:43,200
federal

1380
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:45,359
legalization in our lifetime yep where

1381
00:43:43,199 --> 00:43:47,838
you and me can grow some herb and put it

1382
00:43:45,358 --> 00:43:49,199
in a box and legally send it to a store

1383
00:43:47,838 --> 00:43:53,279
shelf in new york

1384
00:43:49,199 --> 00:43:55,039
or california or oregon or france

1385
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,800
like we're headed there man we're really

1386
00:43:55,039 --> 00:43:59,199
really headed there that's awesome

1387
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:00,480
yeah so my friends in california that

1388
00:43:59,199 --> 00:44:02,159
grow and my friends in new york that

1389
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:04,000
grow we can all just trade products

1390
00:44:02,159 --> 00:44:05,279
just send a couple of ounces around that

1391
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,719
would be sweet

1392
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:08,240
that would be cool it'll be like

1393
00:44:06,719 --> 00:44:10,159
everything else there'll be a couple of

1394
00:44:08,239 --> 00:44:12,078
spots around the country that

1395
00:44:10,159 --> 00:44:13,920
are known for cannabis production just

1396
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:17,920
like there are for wine production

1397
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:19,358
or fashion industry or whatever else and

1398
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:21,440
we won't have people growing in their

1399
00:44:19,358 --> 00:44:24,799
basement everywhere unless they want to

1400
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:26,559
yeah no life helps so much better

1401
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:28,079
i hope some people still want to i hope

1402
00:44:26,559 --> 00:44:30,159
they still want to never stop you

1403
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:30,880

1404
00:44:30,159 --> 00:44:32,318
