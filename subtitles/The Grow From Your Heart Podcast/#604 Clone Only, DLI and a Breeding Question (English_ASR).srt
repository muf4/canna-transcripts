i said i was going to read a few patreon

96
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,480
messages let's not waste

97
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:47,919
too much time let's jump right into the

98
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:51,280
patreon messages

99
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:52,639
for this show the first one comes from

100
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,239
do they want their name said

101
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:55,759
they didn't sign it with their full name

102
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,439
so we're not going to read their name

103
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:59,199
this one goes like this it says hey

104
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:01,280
rosta jeff i hope you're doing well

105
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:03,280
brother i'm a huge fan of the podcast

106
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,120
i am great and thank you for listening

107
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,158
it goes on to say i was wondering about

108
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,640
durbin poison

109
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:09,199
seeds i was always told it was a plant

110
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:11,359
only

111
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:12,958
but i'm seeing seeds for sale online

112
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,800
could imposter seeds

113
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:18,000
be a real thing so he said plant only

114
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,920
but the actual phrase

115
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,840
that we will use in the industry or in

116
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:24,798
the cannabis scene in the community

117
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,120
would be clone only durbin poison was

118
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,480
what was known as a clone only there are

119
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,878
plenty of plants out there that are

120
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:32,399
clone only and i talk about clone only

121
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:33,840
plants all the time let me tell you what

122
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,799
clone only plant means

123
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,598
in my uh definition in our scene so

124
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,680
something

125
00:03:37,598 --> 00:03:41,199
that say i breed a plant let's just say

126
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,560
that i took i want to talk about

127
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:44,318
something i've never released and never

128
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,799
put out that way it's actually clone

129
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:47,199
only

130
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,159
let's say i took a golden goat female

131
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:50,000
and reversed it

132
00:03:48,158 --> 00:03:51,759
made a male out of the golden goat then

133
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
i pollinate the l.a kush

134
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:56,000
i've got golden gar la cushed a golden

135
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,158
goat at this point it's a femme seed

136
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,680
i find a plant that i really really love

137
00:03:58,158 --> 00:04:01,679
i keep that one plant

138
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,280
then i don't grow any more of the seeds

139
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,000
or i toss all of the other plants that i

140
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,799
grew

141
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,959
that one la cush to golden goat is now

142
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:11,280
clone only because it's the only one

143
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:13,039
if i don't release any seeds of it if i

144
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,640
don't have a male of that plant

145
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:16,560
the only way that that plant is

146
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:18,719
available is through clone

147
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,759
only so that becomes what's known as a

148
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,160
clone only

149
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,080
strains like girl scout cookies that is

150
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,600
a clone only the forum cut the thin mint

151
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:28,879
cut whatever you want to call them

152
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,600
that is a clone only gorilla glue number

153
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:31,519
four

154
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,120
is a clone only that's why it's got the

155
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:35,120
number four at the end of it

156
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,600
josie wells had a few gorilla glue

157
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,199
phenotypes he selected the number four

158
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,639
there weren't any more seeds after that

159
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,000
so there could be no more breeding to

160
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,519
make more of those plants

161
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,279
there was number four there was number

162
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:46,719
seven i believe there was another number

163
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:47,758
that was a keeper they chose to go with

164
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,600
the number four

165
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,199
so gorilla glue number four got spread

166
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,960
out that was a clone only

167
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,720
there was no male of the gorilla glue to

168
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:56,159
breed with you don't have a male how are

169
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,160
you to make seeds of that

170
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,520
that are not a gorilla glue outcrosser

171
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,639
or something other than something i'll

172
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:02,560
talk about in a moment

173
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,319
but a clone only is something that a

174
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,879
breeder made and never released

175
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:08,319
seeds of it he only released she may

176
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:10,319
have also only released

177
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:12,399
a clone of that plant so it is a clone

178
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:14,159
only there are no seeds put out there

179
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:16,239
now we're going to talk about things

180
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,840
that make it possible for you to have

181
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,960
that in a seed form

182
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:22,079
i make feminized seeds golden goat is a

183
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:24,719
clone only

184
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:26,319
until i came around and made feminized

185
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,960
seeds of the golden goat that's really

186
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:29,680
easy to make

187
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:30,560
unadulterated golden goat feminized

188
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,800
seeds that are not

189
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,038
imposter seeds what i did i took the

190
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,759
original golden goat clone only popular

191
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:37,279
clone

192
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,360
i treat it with a solution which i

193
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:41,519
talked about in a very recent episode

194
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,199
i treat it with silver thiosulfate a

195
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:45,120
number of times on a schedule and a

196
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,600
specific ratio in dilution

197
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,759
that creates feminized pollen i then put

198
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,360
that feminized pollen on another clone

199
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,120
of the golden goat and i'm not

200
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,400
adulterating the genetics it is golden

201
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,600
goat to golden go

202
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:57,439
the seeds that come out are

203
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,600
unadulterated golden goat s

204
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:02,000
wands i have self that golden goat i

205
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:05,199
have made feminized seeds

206
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,918
so it is possible to make feminized

207
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,639
seeds of a clone only strain that is

208
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:10,478
possible

209
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,478
and very likely especially with

210
00:06:10,478 --> 00:06:14,240
something like durban poison

211
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:15,918
i'm not sure how much durbin poison was

212
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,680
cloned only that's kind of a

213
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:19,599
an african land race it's got a lot of

214
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,639
rumors and myths and legends around it

215
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,000
i'm sure there are a lot of seeds of

216
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,600
that available if you're privy to where

217
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,519
to look for those sort of things if you

218
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,600
know who to ask especially if you're

219
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:29,038
from the durban area i'm sure those

220
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,680
seeds are abundant

221
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:33,519
um so they could be impostors but it is

222
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,918
impo it is possible

223
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:36,639
that they are feminized seeds and they

224
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:38,399
are true

225
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,160
durban poison also it is likely that

226
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:41,918
they are real durbin poison seeds

227
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,919
uh i think ed rosenthal was putting out

228
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:44,639
durbin poison seeds through scentsy seed

229
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:46,318
company

230
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,800
several years ago ed might not have been

231
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,240
involved in that but i do remember ed

232
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,240
and scentsy seed company or somebody

233
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,120
putting out the durbin poison seeds a

234
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,639
long time ago

235
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,800
my memory is a little foggy on some

236
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:59,598
things there's a lot going on in there

237
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,280
so it could be real durbin poison seeds

238
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:04,159
they could be feminized seeds

239
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:05,119
or another option is it could be a back

240
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,720
cross

241
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,038
let me talk about back cross for a

242
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,759
moment i made golden goat feminized

243
00:07:09,038 --> 00:07:11,839
seeds

244
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,680
many people are not fond of running

245
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:14,879
feminized seeds they think that they are

246
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,560
going to be problematic

247
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:18,240
or they are just more into the natural

248
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,240
male female seeds

249
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,598
those people also wanted golden goat

250
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,240
seeds in their garden

251
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:24,639
so the best thing for me to do to was to

252
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,360
make

253
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,400
golden goat bx a bat cross that is

254
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,800
attempting to make

255
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:32,560
a replica of the original golden goat

256
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,759
but i've got to adulterate it by

257
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,639
introducing a male

258
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,360
into the equation so i took a male plant

259
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,160
that was

260
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,439
vastly different in every way from the

261
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,240
original golden goat

262
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:46,000
and i pollinated that male plant where i

263
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,960
pollinated the golden goat with that

264
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,959
male plant

265
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:50,318
now i've got something that is basically

266
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:52,799
if you're gonna think in colors

267
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,598
one was red and one was blue so when we

268
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,360
cross them

269
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:56,878
when i'm looking for the red phenotype

270
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,000
that represents the golden goat it was

271
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,400
going to be very easy

272
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,680
for me to identify their traits were so

273
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:02,878
different they were red and blue they

274
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,400
were black and white

275
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,400
it was very easy for me to tell the

276
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:07,198
difference in the progeny when i grew

277
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:09,519
them out

278
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,800
so i grew out the plants that came from

279
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:12,959
that cross that

280
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,560
it was a daybreaker male is what i used

281
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:16,560
and it's a different day breaker

282
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,319
uh we're gonna avoid that whole rabbit

283
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,680
hole there that's a daybreaker male i

284
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,360
use the daybreaker to pollinate the

285
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,000
golden goat

286
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,280
that made the first round of seeds those

287
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,360
seeds

288
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:28,638
been made i found a male in that batch

289
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,598
of seeds i do know what i'm saying i got

290
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,918
lost for a second

291
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:34,000
i found a male in that batch of seeds

292
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:35,598
that looked identical to the female

293
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,320
golden goat i've already got

294
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:40,000
so daybreaker male pollinated the golden

295
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,719
goat female seeds came out of that

296
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,278
i used those seeds to search for a male

297
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,839
that looked

298
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:46,320
exactly like the original golden goat it

299
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,080
grew

300
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,839
the same height the same width it had

301
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,480
the same branching structure

302
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:53,279
the leaves were exactly the same size

303
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,120
and shape

304
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:57,519
the serrations on the leaves were

305
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,519
exactly the same it reacted the same way

306
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:01,679
to calmac deficiencies it reacted the

307
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,839
same way to being topped and manipulated

308
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:06,559
so this plant was basically a mirror of

309
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:08,800
the female golden goat but it was a boy

310
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:10,879
so at that point i took that boy and

311
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:13,039
pollinated the original golden go

312
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:14,879
my intention now was that these boy

313
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:16,719
genetics and these female genetics are

314
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:17,360
so strongly golden goat that what i

315
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,680
create

316
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:22,000
is going to be a large percent golden

317
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:23,838
goat very dominant very it's like a

318
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,958
replica of the original golden go and i

319
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,560
was successful

320
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:29,039
because the way that i went about that

321
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:30,239
first crossing was by making a very

322
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:31,599
obvious outcross

323
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,759
so i would know what i was looking for

324
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,639
in the males so that is a back cross you

325
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:36,958
take a male

326
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:38,799
you adulterate the original cross then

327
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:41,278
you find a male from that progeny and

328
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:43,838
pollinate the female the original female

329
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:45,039
in an attempt to recreate the original

330
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,800
cross and that's what i've done with the

331
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:49,199
golden goat back cross one

332
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:50,719
my next method would be to run those

333
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,800
seeds again and find another

334
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,480
from that bx1 run those seeds and find a

335
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:55,278
male that again represents that golden

336
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,278
goat female

337
00:09:55,278 --> 00:09:58,639
and pollinate one more time that would

338
00:09:57,278 --> 00:10:00,320
increase the likelihood

339
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:02,480
of getting that perfect golden goat

340
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,959
phenotype out of a pack of seeds

341
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,320
so it is very likely that those durbin

342
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:08,799
poison seeds are

343
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,480
real um i would check with the breeder

344
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:11,679
hopefully that's a reputable breeder

345
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,000
that you are working with but

346
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:15,519
the durban poison has been around in

347
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,039
commercial environments in the

348
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,639
underground cultivation scene in the

349
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:20,078
gray market in the free market

350
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:21,838
for quite a while so it is quite

351
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:24,000
possible that that one is

352
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,360
out there and available but if you see

353
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,958
people trying to sell you something like

354
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,800
golden goat number four

355
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:30,000
regular seeds that's when you need to

356
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:30,559
question things when you see them

357
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,799
selling

358
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:34,479
girl scout cookies regular seeds that's

359
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:36,879
when you question things those are

360
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,720
clone only plants and again a clone only

361
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:40,958
is something the breeder only put

362
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,959
that clone out of we never put out any

363
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:45,599
other seeds we never put out a male

364
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:46,559
you can't reproduce it it is clone only

365
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,959
not available

366
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:49,838
in seed form all right let me keep

367
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:51,919
myself moving

368
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,040
i feel like i've got a good flow going

369
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:55,679
this next question

370
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:57,759
comes from it says use the name baz what

371
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:59,919
up baz thank you for the great message

372
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:01,679
it says oh they've got a this one came

373
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:02,559
from the website where we've got a grow

374
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:03,919
help tab let me

375
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:06,319
tell you about the grow help tab if you

376
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:08,000
go to iriegenetics.com

377
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,760
there's a tab that says grow help click

378
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,039
on that tab fill out a few short

379
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:11,600
questions tell me what's wrong with the

380
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:13,439
plants

381
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,040
and i will do my best to help you out

382
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,920
here is one of those questions

383
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:19,679
from the grow help tab our friend baz is

384
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:21,439
growing a strain called crystal candy

385
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:23,199
they're growing it indoors under led

386
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,360
lights they're in veg

387
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,640
they're growing in soil they've got a

388
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,240
lot of details here i've read the

389
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:30,000
question those details are not going to

390
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,360
matter because i already know the answer

391
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,240
to your question

392
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,039
the problem it says the leaves are

393
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,200
drooping

394
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:38,319
the last few hours of the light cycle

395
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,920
when the lights come back

396
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:43,440
on the plants seem fine this is a thing

397
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:45,519
known as the daily

398
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,959
light integral those plants know that

399
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,399
the light is going to go off in a little

400
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:49,919
bit they're kind of programmed

401
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:51,919
they know the light comes on at this

402
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:54,000
time and the light goes off at that time

403
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:55,919
and they're starting to say hey hey bro

404
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,360
hey sis it's probably bedtime we should

405
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:57,838
start calming down we should get some

406
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,440
tea

407
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,040
start reading a book and settle down for

408
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,880
the night start finding a blanket and a

409
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:04,719
pillow and start chilling out they know

410
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:06,240
that the daily light integral they've

411
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,759
got first of all they know the light is

412
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,600
gonna go off the next thing is they've

413
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:10,958
gotten enough light they're saying hey

414
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,800
that's all the light i'm gonna take for

415
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:14,319
today i don't need more photons i can't

416
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:15,919
photosynthesize anymore

417
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,760
i've taken what i can get so your plants

418
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:19,439
are getting enough light and they also

419
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:20,480
know that sleepy time is coming up so

420
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,760
they're just chilling out

421
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,600
they're just getting lazy they're taking

422
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:24,879
a little bit of a break it is nothing to

423
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,480
be alarmed about

424
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:27,679
the reason that it looks good right when

425
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,039
they wake up is because now they're

426
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:29,759
awake they're ready to start working

427
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:32,078
again

428
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:33,600
you may be able to dial back a little

429
00:12:32,078 --> 00:12:35,519
bit of light you may be able to reduce

430
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,079
the amount of ppfd that these plants are

431
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,360
getting

432
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:38,958
if your plant if your lights are

433
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,480
dimmable you may be able to dim it just

434
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,599
a little bit maybe raise it just a

435
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,079
little bit

436
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,600
or maybe reduce the amount of light

437
00:12:44,078 --> 00:12:46,719
hours you were giving these plants i

438
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,920
know you don't want them to go into

439
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,680
flower too early

440
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:51,120
but that may help you out because they

441
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:52,159
are getting enough light you don't want

442
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,759
to waste electricity

443
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:55,439
if they're already telling you hey bro

444
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:55,919
i'm ready to go to bed if it's like a

445
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,760
solid

446
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:59,199
hour before you turn off those lights

447
00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:01,120
you may be able to adjust

448
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,240
if it's like 30 minutes then i may just

449
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,759
leave it the way it is because they're

450
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,360
saying hey i know it's night time

451
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:07,039
we're gonna go to sleepy time now

452
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,320
nothing to worry about it's uh kind of a

453
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:09,199
good sign it says you got a healthy

454
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,800
garden going on

455
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,480
and they're on a good schedule and they

456
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:14,000
know what to do for you so thank you for

457
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,000
the great question my friend baz

458
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,120
hope i helped you out don't freak out

459
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,639
don't change anything

460
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,399
maybe just adjust a little bit of

461
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:23,200
lighting so you don't waste any

462
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:25,278
electricity all right this one comes

463
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,560
from our friend alabama man and this one

464
00:13:25,278 --> 00:13:29,360
was from patreon

465
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:31,278
it is a two-part question the first one

466
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,278
says mr rasta jeff

467
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:34,639
most of your strains share the word tall

468
00:13:33,278 --> 00:13:36,320
in their description

469
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,399
starting with your shortest variety can

470
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,240
you please name the five shortest plants

471
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:44,240
in your lineup do you have a shorteth

472
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:45,919
a short-ish arthritis painkiller

473
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,919
that is a really great question and i

474
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:49,360
replied with unfortunately most of what

475
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:51,919
i breed is like a uh

476
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,639
a sativa dominant kind of a skinny leaf

477
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:55,439
a thin

478
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:56,480
leaf kind of a hybrid of mostly sativa

479
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,560
dominant genetics

480
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,399
and most of them are going to get quite

481
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:01,679
tall on you for shorter plants i would

482
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:04,879
probably recommend

483
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:06,638
prana morning dew uh and then i may say

484
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:07,838
something like um what was the other one

485
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:09,919
i recommended prana

486
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:11,760
and morning do and sometimes the orange

487
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:12,879
gasm will stay short if you don't veg

488
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:15,039
for too long

489
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:16,240
but that's oh sun kiss is the other one

490
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:17,838
i would recommend also

491
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,600
those are what i've got for shorter

492
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:21,120
although they are going to get tall

493
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,399
if you want to prevent too tall of a

494
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,679
plant that's when you got to work on

495
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,839
canopy control

496
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:28,000
you can keep anything short if you scrog

497
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:30,720
it down learn how to work a scrog canopy

498
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,240
uh maybe a two or three layer scrog the

499
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,519
first one is to spread them out instead

500
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,879
of getting them growing up tall

501
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,560
you just put that scrog down and make

502
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:37,919
them go straight out then you let them

503
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:39,599
grow up a little bit into that that

504
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:41,278
second one is to kind of support the

505
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,120
buds and the third one is to really give

506
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:45,039
you some support for tall colas

507
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,879
but you can run anything if you scrog it

508
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:47,439
down learn to work it manipulate it bend

509
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:50,720
it over

510
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:52,720
you can figure that part out arthritis

511
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,000
i think the arise is great for arthritis

512
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,480
although it's going to get kind of tall

513
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,480
on you

514
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,320
i would say maybe try morning dew that

515
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,240
is going to be a great all-around

516
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,519
indica sativa hybrid that will give you

517
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,278
some nice pain relief

518
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:05,039
shouldn't get too tall on you all right

519
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:07,679
there is a second part of

520
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:09,599
the question and it says mr jeff would

521
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:11,759
there be any benefit realized if a

522
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,159
grower saved the pollen from a male

523
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:16,159
plant of a regular pack of irish seeds

524
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:17,679
and then used that pollen on selected

525
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:20,240
buds of a female

526
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:21,519
plant i get free seeds for my trouble

527
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,480
but would those seeds

528
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:25,600
be stable mirrors of each plant this is

529
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,159
a great question

530
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,800
uh so they are asking if they took

531
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:31,120
pollen

532
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:33,120
from a male plant from a regular pack of

533
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,000
seeds so you got a regular pack of seeds

534
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,519
you find a boy

535
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,440
you collect the pollen you are on the

536
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:39,679
path to breeding already

537
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,199
later use that pollen on select buds of

538
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:42,799
a different female plant

539
00:15:41,198 --> 00:15:45,039
that is what you do that is how we start

540
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:47,278
making new crosses uh you may make

541
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:48,719
gold or you may make something that

542
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:50,320
isn't gold you may make something that

543
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,839
is mediocre and okay

544
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,680
or you may make a bunch of hemp seeds

545
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,440
that you end up wanting to throw away

546
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:57,599
uh likelihood of that happening if

547
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,040
you're using ire crosses

548
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,959
you're very likely going to have good

549
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:02,559
success because i've done good work

550
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:04,239
before you i've set you so up for

551
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:04,958
success by selecting good breeding

552
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,639
plants

553
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:08,319
i bred with them sent them along to you

554
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:11,198
they're good breeding stock

555
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,759
so yes basically you would get good free

556
00:16:11,198 --> 00:16:13,838
seeds

557
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:14,959
now the question here is would those

558
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:17,440
seeds be stable

559
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:19,359
mirrors of each parent that kind of

560
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,160
depends on the breeding stock which you

561
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,079
start with

562
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:23,278
you started with if you start with pure

563
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:25,198
irie genetics

564
00:16:23,278 --> 00:16:26,480
you may breed yourself into what we call

565
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:28,879
a bottleneck

566
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:31,120
most of what i breed has got a rise in

567
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:33,679
it it's got that king solomon in there

568
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,600
so if you breed uh if you bread the a

569
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:37,120
rise to strawberry starburst

570
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,720
you're going to get a lot of a rise

571
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,480
dominant stuff if you breed

572
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,399
strawberry starburst and blue raspberry

573
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,759
truffle there are two arise parents in

574
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:45,120
there you're going to get some arise

575
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,600
dominant traits

576
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,440
but if you take that the male and put it

577
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,519
on something that doesn't have the same

578
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,920
parent in there yes you are opening up

579
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,799
a lot of options for great breeding now

580
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:57,519
are you going to get

581
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:58,879
mirrors of the parents you will find

582
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,799
some phenotypes

583
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:02,480
that look just like the mommy plant

584
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:04,399
you'll find some phenotypes that look

585
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,838
just like the daddy plant then you will

586
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,160
find some phenotypes that are the

587
00:17:05,838 --> 00:17:08,879
perfect 50 50 mix of both of those

588
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,720
plants

589
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,240
then you're going to find everything in

590
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,160
the middle of those also

591
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,359
depending on how large of a population

592
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,720
of seeds you can run

593
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,958
that's when you're going to start seeing

594
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:21,600
the variation you can make

595
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:23,279
quite a few seeds in very small plants

596
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,719
just by pollinating one branch or

597
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:25,759
growing just little tiny plants and

598
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,120
pollinating them

599
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:28,798
you can make plenty of seeds for

600
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:31,279
yourself to experiment with

601
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:32,160
so stable mirrors of each parent you're

602
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:34,240
going to see

603
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,880
phenotypes like the mom phenotypes like

604
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,079
the dad you're going to see 50 50 mixes

605
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,520
then you're going to see everything in

606
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:41,199
between something that's a little more

607
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:42,639
mommy but looks like daddy something's a

608
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,279
little bit more daddy that looks like

609
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,799
mommy

610
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:46,319
it depends on which traits in those

611
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:46,879
plants are dominant and recessive and

612
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:48,879
which

613
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,320
pop up more often now what you're also

614
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,440
going to see

615
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:56,240
is representations of the grandparents

616
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,240
so the mom plant also has a mom and dad

617
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,440
the dad plant also has a mom and dad

618
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,440
you're going to see

619
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,880
varieties of those popping up and if you

620
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,480
know what the grandparents are it's more

621
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,000
obvious you know what to look for

622
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,000
i see those things because i've got the

623
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,359
whole family tree going i've created

624
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,200
them i've bred them i worked with them

625
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:12,959
for so long that i can identify

626
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,279
grandparents and great grandparents in

627
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,679
the progeny so you will see

628
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:19,440
uh yes stable parent stable mirrors of

629
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,759
each parent but you're gonna see

630
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,200
random representations of grandparents

631
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:25,440
and everything in between

632
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,240
it's all about which plants you select

633
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,798
some things

634
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,359
give you wild phenotype variation and

635
00:18:28,798 --> 00:18:31,839
some

636
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:33,439
are very uniform from the first cross if

637
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:34,959
you get wild variation

638
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,640
pick your favorite female and your

639
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,440
favorite male out of the population and

640
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,120
breed them

641
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,480
and then do it again and do it again and

642
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:41,599
you'll narrow down to the traits that

643
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,960
you're looking for

644
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:46,558
so um you may find stable mirrors of

645
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,200
each parent but you're also going to

646
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:49,119
find

647
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,480
uh outliers you're gonna find things

648
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:51,199
that look like mommy things that look

649
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,440
like daddy

650
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,200
like i keep saying that 50 50 and then

651
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,279
grandparents and then maybe

652
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,319
just maybe you will find some

653
00:18:57,279 --> 00:19:00,879
grandparents

654
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:02,639
there in that mix all right ladies and

655
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,600
gentlemen boys and girls pimps and hoes

656
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,600
friends and foes

657
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:07,359
smokers growers clone cutters paul and

658
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:08,719
chuckers all you beautiful people out

659
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:10,079
there in cannabis world i want to thank

660
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,279
you again for listening to another

661
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:13,678
episode of the grow from your heart

662
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:14,480
podcast i feel like this episode went by

663
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:16,320
quite quickly

664
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,519
i answered three messages maybe i should

665
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:19,038
have tried to do four

666
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:21,200
no need to ramble and make extra time

667
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:23,119
out of a podcast it's all about quality

668
