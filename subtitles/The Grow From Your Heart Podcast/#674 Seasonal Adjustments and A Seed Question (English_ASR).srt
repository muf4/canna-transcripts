00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:26,958
seasonal adjustments here i am in

61
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:29,839
southern colorado it's not quite cold

62
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,360
yet but i do know that hoodie season is

63
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,598
soon approaching that's right it's going

64
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,599
to be fall here very soon i'm surprised

65
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:37,280
i haven't busted out the hoodie yet but

66
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:39,598
i want to be prepared so we're going to

67
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,598
talk about this episode right now we

68
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:44,079
need to get ahead of the game we don't

69
00:02:41,598 --> 00:02:46,479
need to have our equipment in the garage

70
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,080
dusty dirty under a tarp maybe you need

71
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:50,318
to order it from amazon maybe need to

72
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,080
figure that [ __ ] out we don't need to be

73
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:54,159
delayed on having equipment we need to

74
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,599
be ahead of the game for seasonal

75
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:56,560
changes that is something that is very

76
00:02:55,598 --> 00:02:58,318
important

77
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,318
the bigger the grow gets the more

78
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:02,639
important that is it's very easy to

79
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:04,878
change the environment adjust the

80
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:09,839
conditions in a smaller room once you

81
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:12,158
start going 4 6 15 20 50 100 lights it

82
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,479
gets increasingly more challenging to

83
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:16,878
control the room control the space

84
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:19,679
adjust to the outside environment last

85
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:20,479
year in colorado we had a day where it

86
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,719
was

87
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:24,399
negative 17 degrees it's one of the

88
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:26,560
coldest weekends i've ever experienced

89
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,920
that i can remember in my adult life

90
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,840
absolutely one of the coldest

91
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:32,719
experiences i can remember in my growing

92
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:35,439
career i do think i saw a negative 24 at

93
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:38,080
one point in my life that negative 17

94
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:39,680
really put some stress on my grow space

95
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,400
so we need to be prepared for things

96
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,319
like negative 17 coming up pretty soon

97
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,200
here the conditions the environment the

98
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:49,518
temperature changes rapidly so i in

99
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:51,518
colorado need to get my [ __ ] together

100
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,519
and need to get my gear prepared get a

101
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,519
strategy in place start thinking about

102
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,519
what i'm going to do what type of

103
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,920
seasonal changes are coming in your

104
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,920
location you may be listening anywhere

105
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:04,158
on the planet big shout out wherever you

106
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:05,679
are but think about the changes that are

107
00:04:04,158 --> 00:04:07,438
coming is it going to get colder is it

108
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,599
going to get hotter will it be more

109
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:12,400
humid will it get drier what do you need

110
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:15,199
to do to adjust your growth to set

111
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,918
yourself up for success that's one of my

112
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:20,719
main goals of this podcast my goal is to

113
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:22,478
help you set yourself up for success

114
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,479
i've had a lot of trial and error i've

115
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:26,319
had a lot of experience i want to take a

116
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:27,680
lot of that experience and cut out a lot

117
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:29,680
of [ __ ]

118
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,600

will fail try to show you the best way

121
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:37,439
to do it that is my main goal here so

122
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:39,680
let's focus in on a few of the

123
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:42,240
adjustments that i feel like i need to

124
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:45,040
make for my grow environment i am

125
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,439
currently going from a warm summer

126
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,360
environment here in colorado we had 104

127
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:52,560
degree days we had 108s there might have

128
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:55,040
been 112 in there we had some super hot

129
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,519
days here over the summer so i have got

130
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,120
led lighting in my main flowering space

131
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:01,359
right now that's right i've been using

132
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,199
uh canon lighting from black sail market

133
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,960
big shout out to black cell market so

134
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,759
over the summer time and over the spring

135
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:09,599
time i had great success with the canon

136
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,759
lighting from black sail market however

137
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,080
i know that in the winter time those

138
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:16,400
lights will not keep my grow space warm

139
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:18,319
enough those lights are great for when

140
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:20,638
it is hot outside and i don't need

141
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:23,199
warmth in my grow but it is about to get

142
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:25,759
really cold and i'm going to use my grow

143
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,600
lights to heat my grow environment also

144
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:30,160
i'll use my grow lights to sort of heat

145
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,400
part of my living space as well the heat

146
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,240
will get ducted into my living area i

147
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:36,319
will be heating up the grow space with

148
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,160
the lights exhausting that extra heat

149
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:39,839
into my living room and that way i don't

150
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,360
have to turn on the heater as much i'll

151
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:43,279
try to use that electricity that i'm

152
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,120
already running for the grow lights to

153
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:47,038
efficiently heat my house so that's one

154
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,199
adjustment i will make

155
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:51,038
when it gets just a touch cooler when i

156
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,600
have a weekend available i am going to

157
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:56,079
take down all of my led lighting and

158
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,759
re-hang my hps lighting that's right it

159
00:05:56,079 --> 00:06:00,000
will have high pressure sodium lights

160
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:02,639
for flower over the winter time that's

161
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,399
one thing that i definitely will change

162
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,720
uh there's nothing wrong with the canon

163
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:08,719
lights those canon leds are amazing

164
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,800
lights they make beautiful plants the

165
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,520
plants grow with great vigor in fact i

166
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,439
will leave the cannons in one area in a

167
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:17,279
veg space because that area stays warmer

168
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:19,439
just naturally and where the grow space

169
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:21,359
is but the flowering room does need to

170
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:23,600
get changed it's up against the exterior

171
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,879
wall of the house i will get much colder

172
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,120
there we're going to swap that out for

173
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:28,639
hbss nothing wrong with the cannons

174
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,240
other than they don't make enough heat

175
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,160
for the winter so i'm going to hang a

176
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,519
light that will make enough heat for the

177
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:37,520
winter and use that gear to my advantage

178
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:39,120
why would i put up a heater when i've

179
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:40,959
got hps lights i can just throw those

180
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,879
right up that is my theory if you have a

181
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:44,478
heater if you want to do it do that but

182
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:46,079
i'm going to use the hps lights because

183
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:47,918
i've got them and then i conduct that

184
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:49,758
heat that comes from those to another

185
00:06:47,918 --> 00:06:52,478
room as well heat up part of the living

186
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:54,720
space that's the first major adjustment

187
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:56,478
i will make because i will use the hps

188
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,800
lights to heat up part of the house and

189
00:06:56,478 --> 00:07:00,560
the grow space so the way my grow is set

190
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,560
up once i change those lights i will

191
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,800
need to change my ducting that will also

192
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,519
change the way i set up my carbon filter

193
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,280
so we have caused a chain reaction of

194
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:11,198
things to set up and change in the grow

195
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:12,799
that's a beautiful process i think that

196
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,879
resetting things up and rebuilding

197
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,720
things gives me a good opportunity to

198
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:18,000
clean things that i may not have cleaned

199
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,520
maintenance things that may not have

200
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,959
gotten the maintenance they needed

201
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:22,639
things are coming off of the ceiling

202
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:24,799
they'll be down on the floor i can clean

203
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,560
every inch of it before it goes back up

204
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,639
it'll go into summer storage i'll wrap

205
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,399
it up in plastic i will clean it then

206
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,960
wrap it up into plastic put it in summer

207
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:34,799
storage that way next summer when i need

208
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:36,399
it or when the winter went whichever

209
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,919
when i need that gear again it's clean

210
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:39,679
it's ready to rock it's been cleaned up

211
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:41,120
i don't have to go polishing it but now

212
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,199
is a good time to clean everything up

213
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,959
give everything a good once over i will

214
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,280
probably repaint the walls while i'm in

215
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:49,198
the process of rebuilding everything but

216
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:51,359
i will definitely do the different

217
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:54,240
lighting and redo the ducting which is

218
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:56,560
going to lead me to redoing the exiting

219
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,720
of the room where the air the ducting

220
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,959
goes out which is going to lead to me

221
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,680
repainting the entire room which will

222
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:05,598
probably lead to me redoing the flooring

223
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,759
in the entire room that sounds like a

224
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:09,598
task but i love it and it's like it's

225
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,038
like a trigger for good work to happen a

226
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:13,199
lot of these things probably needed to

227
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:14,800
be done anyway so this is a good time to

228
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,919
do it the seasonal change will trigger

229
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,000
this

230
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:20,000
now things to think about i said i'm

231
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,839
going to change my ducting something to

232
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,199
think about is the air that you were

233
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:24,719
bringing into your grow i don't know

234
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,000
where the air is coming in from i don't

235
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,360
know if you've got an air conditioner i

236
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,279
don't know if you have a passive intake

237
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,598
and active intake if we are bringing

238
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:33,199
frosty cold air into our warm grow

239
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:35,120
environment where we've got grow lights

240
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,959
going and it's nice and warm in there

241
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,038
we're bringing basically icicles into

242
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:41,119
the room that creates condensation

243
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:43,439
moisture what that really creates is

244
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,959
opportunities for powdery mildew we've

245
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,040
already had enough powdery mildew and

246
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:48,719
the warm season in the spring and summer

247
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:51,360
season let's get away from that for the

248
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,278
winter we've got such dry conditions

249
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,519
let's avoid powdery mildew and use those

250
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:57,519
dry conditions to our advantage you can

251
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:59,360
bring that outside air into your grow

252
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:01,039
but let's warm it up before it hits the

253
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,278
grow environment maybe bring it into

254
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:05,278
another room warm it up then shoot it

255
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:07,600
into your grow space something like that

256
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:09,838
but let's not shoot that frosty cold air

257
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,159
directly into the grow directly over the

258
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:14,000
plants if it's got to go directly into

259
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:16,000
the room if you don't have any other way

260
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,440
to do it run some ducting to where it

261
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,360
goes somewhere else further from the

262
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,360
plants then it warms up a little bit

263
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,720
before it actually makes it to the

264
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,080
plants that's a good thing to think

265
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,920
about

266
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,600
is the water which you are feeding these

267
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:30,240
plants where does the water come from is

268
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,080
it super cold if i turn on the water

269
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,839
outside in the middle of winter that

270
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,080
water is super cold i wouldn't want to

271
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:38,320
put that water on my plants if i get

272
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,920
water from one spot in my house it is

273
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,240
super cold if i get water from the

274
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:44,240
kitchen it's nice and room temperature

275
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,519
don't feed your plants really cold water

276
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,680
think of it like this if you wouldn't

277
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,278
put your feet in there don't feed it to

278
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:50,958
your plants your plants can't walk away

279
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:52,720
your plants can't pull their feet out

280
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:54,319
the plants can't say ah [ __ ] that's cold

281
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,920
i need to get out of the water they're

282
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,480
stuck there you're torturing them don't

283
00:09:55,919 --> 00:10:00,958
do that don't feed them super cold water

284
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:04,000
get that water warmed up at least 69 70

285
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:05,919
degrees should be ideal for a soilless

286
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,078
soil coco sort of a grow if you're

287
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:09,360
growing hydro whole another ball game do

288
00:10:08,078 --> 00:10:10,958
your thing you guys like to adjust your

289
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,278
temperatures accordingly to avoid the

290
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:15,679
mildew i'm not an expert in that area

291
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:18,078
i'm talking about something with soil

292
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:18,799
soilless mix cocoa something like that

293
00:10:18,078 --> 00:10:20,559
so

294
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:22,078
don't feed too cold of water it will

295
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:24,000
shock your roots be cool with that

296
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:25,359
especially if it gets real cold outside

297
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,839
all right another thing that people

298
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:30,959
often overlook when it gets cold how

299
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,480
cold is the floor in your grow space i

300
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:34,559
talked a minute ago about putting cold

301
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,320
water on your feet can you walk around

302
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:38,799
in the grow space barefoot and your feet

303
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:41,040
not be too cold it's not a good idea to

304
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:43,599
walk around the grow space barefoot

305
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:45,120
let's talk about why i've got one solid

306
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,278
reason why i think it's not a good idea

307
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,679
to walk around the grow space barefoot

308
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:51,600
if and when we apply pesticides i apply

309
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:52,479
pesticides on a routine basis in my

310
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,440
garden

311
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:57,120
i apply spray pesticides i also spray

312
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,120
foliar feeds which we may talk about

313
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,919
more on this episode i apply a lot of

314
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,440
things to that grow i feed the plants a

315
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:05,759
lot of [ __ ] ends up on that floor

316
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:08,000
pesticides grow nutrients a lot of stuff

317
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:10,399
is on that floor i do my best to keep it

318
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,480
clean i mop it i clean it i sweep it but

319
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:13,759
there is stuff on that floor you

320
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,879
shouldn't be in there barefoot because

321
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:18,879
the bottoms of your feet are part of the

322
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:21,278
one of the most absorbent parts of your

323
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:22,958
body for chemicals toxins contaminants

324
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:25,039
you can suck up pesticides through the

325
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:26,799
bottoms of your feet quite quickly so

326
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:29,360
technically maybe you shouldn't be in

327
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:31,120
there barefoot also protect your toes uh

328
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,200
what kind of hippie are you in there

329
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,600
barefoot anyway if that's your style

330
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,839
be that way bro but uh it's risky it's

331
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,200
dangerous so um

332
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,880
walk around see if the floor is cold

333
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,120
that's the main point is it cold on your

334
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:45,278
feet if it's cold on your feet get the

335
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,959
plants up off of the floor it's okay to

336
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:48,639
have a cold grow room floor but raise

337
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:50,879
the plants up off of it maybe just put

338
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:52,559
them on a cinder block maybe a very

339
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:54,559
affordable way to get the plants up off

340
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:58,239
the floor is to flip another pot upside

341
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:59,919
down and set the pot right on that pot

342
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,519
just you got one upside down another pot

343
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:03,838
on another pot now you're that pot

344
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:05,200
height taller and off the ground

345
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,399
sometimes that's not the best because it

346
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,240
gets you too close to the light

347
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,519
sometimes if i got a plant that's not

348
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,039
growing tall enough that's how i get the

349
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:12,240
[ __ ] closer to the light and adjust

350
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:13,599
that plant to match the rest of the

351
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,200
canopy but

352
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,560
get them up off the floor flip a pot

353
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,959
upside down

354
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:20,719
use some cinder blocks build a table get

355
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:23,278
those plants off the floor because it is

356
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,440
probably quite cold so think about the

357
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:28,480
air coming in think about the cold water

358
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,959
and think about that cold intake cold

359
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:33,360
floor cold water cold intake it is all

360
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:35,278
going to happen very soon um we don't

361
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,600
want to freeze out these plants try to

362
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:39,838
use that cold air to your advantage

363
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,320
but not don't blast the plants don't

364
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,839
cause any frostbite set yourself up for

365
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,040
success you guys this time of the year

366
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:46,880
is coming

367
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:48,958
maybe time to turn off some things turn

368
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:50,639
on some other things i don't know your

369
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:52,799
full grow environment i don't have your

370
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:54,959
pulse monitor i don't know what your uh

371
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:56,559
minder unit is telling you pay attention

372
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:59,278
to that and make the adjustments but i'm

373
00:12:56,559 --> 00:13:00,719
giving you a heads up the best i can now

374
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:03,679
is the time to start thinking about the

375
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,680
equipment for the seasonal changes set

376
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:07,919
yourself up for success don't say i can

377
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:09,599
go buy that in two weeks because

378
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:10,879
everybody's gonna go to the groce store

379
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,200
and buy that in two weeks and it's gonna

380
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:14,958
be gone sold out especially during these

381
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,639
weird times it takes a really long time

382
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:18,958
for [ __ ] to get replenished reshipped

383
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,799
and restocked get ahead of the game go

384
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:23,039
get that [ __ ] now especially if it's in

385
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:25,519
the budget if it's in the budget why are

386
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:27,120
you [ __ ] around go get it uh go get

387
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,120
it before it goes in demand because once

388
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,399
it goes in high demand they'll raise the

389
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,560
price on you it's not going to go on

390
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:34,399
sale when people need more of it that is

391
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:36,879

[ __ ] to do that you didn't know there's

408
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:13,198
especially in a commercial environment

409
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:15,120
you guys i am very experienced in

410

how to operate in a new grow i say the

413
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,320

414
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,639
find out what went wrong last night

415
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,920

416
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,159
light environment you've got 100

417
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:30,159
flowering lights somewhere between 30

418
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:32,879
and 60 vegetative lights you've got

419
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:36,719
clones clone trays hydro pumps fans air

420
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:38,480
conditioners uh co2 machines computers

421
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,079
all kinds of [ __ ] in a big facility the

422
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:43,120
first thing we need to do when we walk

423
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:44,559
in is find out what went wrong last

424
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,560

can get done today go ahead and do that

426
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:50,638

427
00:14:48,078 --> 00:14:52,879
surprises are going to be tomorrow you

428
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,320
could have a five-minute surprise you

429
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:56,639
could and i hope this doesn't happen you

430
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,240
could kick over a bucket take you 15 20

431
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,680
minutes to mop that bucket up you got to

432
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,759
go smoke a dab get your [ __ ] back

433
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:03,599
together and regroup uh maybe that's a

434
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:05,679
30 minute [ __ ] waste of your day that

435

you didn't see coming or maybe just

436
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:09,359
maybe i don't even want to jinx you

437
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,879
maybe something catastrophic goes wrong

438
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,560
in the grove and you don't get any of

439
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:15,278
your side work done you don't get any of

00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,360
it was so good it was tonight it's kind

450
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,519
of late now that i'm recording but the

451
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,199
vibes were high i had to do something uh

452
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:41,759
we got stuff we want to do in our lives

453
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:43,359
but try to knock out those garden chores

454
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,199
if you've got a small grow it really

455
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,159
can't take that long if you've got a big

456
00:15:45,198 --> 00:15:48,078
grow

457
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:50,000
then you ask for it get in there and do

458
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:51,919
the work i know what my job is i know

459
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,320
how long it should take i know how much

460
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:56,958
to allow myself and i also know that

461
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:59,839
[ __ ] happens surprises come up things go

462
00:15:56,958 --> 00:16:02,000
wrong uh it's murphy's law what can go

463
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:04,880
wrong [ __ ] will and be prepared for

464
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,879
that it's how you react respond and

465
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:08,399
adjust to those things that make you a

466
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:10,799
good grower but if you're

467
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,320
prepared those things are much easier to

468
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:14,319
deal with alright i'm [ __ ] rambling

469
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,079
set yourself up for success you guys

470
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,920
that's the bottom line here i want you

471
00:16:16,078 --> 00:16:20,319
to succeed as much as you want to be

472
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:21,759

seeds and then not have a fruitful

477
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,560
harvest that's going to make me feel bad

478
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:34,000
especially if you bought my seeds and

479
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:36,319

480

00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,360

from my buddy scentsy goes a lot like

496
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:11,759
blend is working bland i said bland it

497
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:13,119
doesn't say bland here it says let me

498
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:14,879
try on this camera maybe this camera

499
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:17,519
will get it right your silver

500
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:20,319
thiosulfate blend is working amazingly

501
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:22,798
on my autoflower project so a few

502
00:17:20,318 --> 00:17:24,879
episodes back quite a few episodes back

503
00:17:22,798 --> 00:17:27,599
i gave an explanation on how to make

504
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:30,240
silver thiosulfate to use for reversing

505
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:31,918
plants to make feminized seeds our

506
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:35,759
friend cynthia nasty here has used my

507
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:37,280
recipe to make some autoflower feminized

508
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:39,119
seeds which is a great thing i don't

509
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:41,038
make autoflowers so i'm glad somebody

510
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:43,279
else is out there doing it it said i

511
00:17:41,038 --> 00:17:45,519
have followed your instructions to a tea

512
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:47,918
and i'm getting a pretty decent amount

513
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:49,839
of pollen that is great to hear because

514
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,440
sometimes the recipe will take some

515
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:53,678
adjustment the first time you make that

516
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,519
mix it might not be strong enough to

517
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:58,400
reverse the plant it might be so strong

518
00:17:55,519 --> 00:18:00,160
it burns the plant uh the spray schedule

519
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,160
may need to be more frequently less

520
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,360
frequently it might burn it might not do

521
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:06,080
anything to the plant there are

522
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:07,678
adjustments to be made per plant here so

523
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:08,960
i'm glad that it worked for you on the

524
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,200
first try

525
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:13,519
that gives me confidence that my mixture

526
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,120
is working it's very universal versatile

527
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:17,599
and it worked on your stuff that feels

528
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:20,159
good so it says big up for sharing that

529
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:22,639
it saved us a ton of money and i'm not

530
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,798
even close to using up the first batch

531
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:27,120
yes silver thiosulfate or at least the

532
00:18:24,798 --> 00:18:29,679
components to make such are very

533
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:31,279
affordable when i see people selling

534
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:33,679
products to reverse plants and i see

535
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:35,279
companies selling silver thiosulfate for

536
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:38,080
exorbitant amounts it drives me a little

537
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:41,038
bit crazy because you can make hundreds

538
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:43,038
of gallons for like 30 bucks hundreds of

539
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:45,519
gallons for maybe 30 bucks and most of

540
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:47,200
that 30 is probably going to be shipping

541
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:49,679
uh the two products you need are very

542
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,360
affordable uh 10 bucks per bottle 10

543
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,919
bucks for shipping and then you need a

544
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:55,839
gallon of distilled water every time you

545
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,600
do it and that'll make enough to reverse

546
00:18:55,839 --> 00:18:59,759
a plan and you got it covered that's

547
00:18:57,599 --> 00:19:01,839
really affordable in my opinion uh so

548
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:03,359
when i see the people charging too much

549
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:05,839
it drives me crazy that's just price

550
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:07,038
gouging that's stabbing at the community

551
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:08,639
that that shouldn't be a thing we should

552
00:19:07,038 --> 00:19:10,079
be able to have access to the products

553
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,919
which we need so there you go make your

554
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:13,038
own silver sulfate much more cost

555
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,600
effective

556
00:19:13,038 --> 00:19:18,319
there is more it says ah this is kind of

557
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:20,240
a breeding and market question this is

558
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:22,079
sort of a sales question a business

559
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,240
question i really do like this as i'm a

560
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:27,279
great person to ask this i would say it

561
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:30,720
says knowing that the market is driving

562
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:33,279
fem and autoflower seeds as a breeder

563
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:36,079
trying to serve the market does it make

564
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:38,399
sense to search for elite females more

565
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:39,839
than trying out different males

566
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,360
so there's a couple things to talk about

567
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:42,319
in that one sentence there in that one

568
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:44,319
statement

569
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:46,399
knowing that the market is driving on

570
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:49,439
fems and autos yes

571
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:51,280
the market loves feminized seeds more

572
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,120
than half of what i sell would be femme

573
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:55,200
seeds if i could make more fems i can't

574
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:57,279
keep up i don't make enough fems i make

575
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,480
a lot of regular seeds uh we're going to

576
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:00,240
talk about that in a minute they're

577
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,360
honestly easier you get more pollen from

578
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,440
a regular plant you don't have to

579
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:04,959
reverse it reversing is science you have

580
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,720
to learn each plant

581
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,000
takes a little more effort time energy

582
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,558
space work

583
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,400
um so the market is after femmes and

584
00:20:10,558 --> 00:20:13,918
autos that is very true but there are a

585
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,400
lot of people

586
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:18,240
who will not grow feminized seeds there

587
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,400
are a lot of people who will not grow

588
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,079
autoflower seeds there are large

589
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,240
portions of the cannabis community who

590
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:27,119
are opposed to both of those i'm not

591
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:29,120
bashing those products i have no nothing

592
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:31,359
against autoflowers

593
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:34,719
especially against feminized seeds but a

594
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:36,879
lot of people will not grow them a lot

595
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:39,200
of people feel that feminized seeds are

596
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:42,080
doing something wrong to the gene pool

597
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,600
uh a lot of people um just simply won't

598
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:44,798
grow those seeds i was gonna talk about

599
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:46,319
a certain group and why but we don't

600
00:20:44,798 --> 00:20:48,319
need to go down that path today let's

601
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:49,839
keep me a little bit focused a lot of

602
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:51,119
people do want the reg seeds a lot of

603
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:52,639
people want the fems a lot of people

604
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:55,439
want the autoflowers i see that there's

605
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:57,120
a market for all of that let me follow

606
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,558
up it says as a breeder trying to serve

607
00:20:57,119 --> 00:21:00,158
the market does it make more sense to

608
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:02,639
search for elite females more than

609
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:05,520
trying out different males um you have

610
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:07,919
to do both as a breeder who wants to be

611
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:10,240
uh what's the word um

612
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:11,759
relevant in the market that wants to be

613
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,839
on top of the market that wants

614
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:16,000
customers you have to do both you have

615
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:18,079
to have solid a solid male plant at

616
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,079
least the male plant is kind of what

617
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:22,480
sets you apart everybody's got the

618
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:24,798
females everybody's growing the females

619
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:27,599
the entire community is growing the

620
00:21:24,798 --> 00:21:30,240
females we see those in large numbers

621
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:33,199
it's the breeders who are seeking out

622
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:35,440
the elite males that do the work to make

623
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,519
new things so we've got to find both

624
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,519
we've got to find the males that will

625
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:42,079
contribute to the gene pool and move the

626
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:44,240
cannabis plants forward for our purpose

627
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:46,240
whether my purpose is usually uh

628
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,960
producing high yielding plants with a

629
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:50,720
lot of terps and very high thc potency

630
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,960
that is my thing that's because that's

631
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:55,120
what i enjoy and i feel like since i

632
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,279
make a product that i enjoy i am

633
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:59,678
successful because i'm doing it with my

634
00:21:57,279 --> 00:22:01,519
heart for myself and other people like

635
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:04,080
it it's like a good musician

636
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:06,319
if your favorite musician wrote songs

637
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:07,839
for some girl those songs are gonna suck

638
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:09,839
but if your favorite musician writes

639
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:11,519
songs for themselves they're gonna be

640
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:13,759
great songs and that girl will love it

641
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:16,319
and so will you i think that's why my

642
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:18,798
brand works i make a product that i feel

643
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:20,319
is up to my standards up to what i like

644
00:22:18,798 --> 00:22:21,918
and you guys happen to like it also

645
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:24,240
because i've got high standards and i

646
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:26,240
know what to uh what people want what to

647
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,440
expect and what to look for in quality

648
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,558
cannabis

649
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:32,400
so um a lot of it is finding that mail a

650
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:34,158
lot of it is finding the boy a lot of my

651
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,159
company is based on king solomon you

652
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:38,559
mentioned solomon later in this message

653
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:40,080
solomon is the stud it took me a lot of

654
00:22:38,558 --> 00:22:41,839
searching a lot of hunting to find

655
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:44,000
solomon first i had the plant i had to

656
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:46,399
find the plant that fit the criteria

657
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,640
which i was looking for i had a list i'm

658
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,720
kind of an ocd guy i write lists on

659
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,320
paper it had to have all of these traits

660
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,480
and once i found to plant a few plants

661
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:56,399
with all of those traits we bred with

662
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,000
them then we grew out those seeds and we

663
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,480
had to see what that male plant was

664
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,558
doing to the seeds so that's how i found

665
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,480
solomon that's why solomon stands out

666
00:23:02,558 --> 00:23:06,879
that's why my company stands out because

667
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:09,279
of that elite male now the other half

668
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:11,600
the equation you do have to have those

669
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:13,279
elite females having a stud and a bunch

670
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:15,519
of half-assed females to breed with

671
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:17,678
won't do it you have to make solid

672
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:20,319
female selections now i said before the

673
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:22,798
entire community has got females they're

674
00:23:20,319 --> 00:23:24,558
all pheno hunting female plants so we've

675
00:23:22,798 --> 00:23:26,400
got the beautiful advantage of i can

676
00:23:24,558 --> 00:23:28,879
grow the plants and i can find my own

677
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,559
females or we've got a squad of people

678
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,880
out there buying seeds getting free

679
00:23:30,558 --> 00:23:35,359
seeds growing seeds trading seeds and

680
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:37,520
they find good keepers and somehow they

681
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:40,959
end up back in my garden and i can breed

682
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:43,519
with those elite females as well so the

683
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:45,278
question is uh does it make sense to

684
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:47,599
search for elite females more than

685
00:23:45,278 --> 00:23:49,759
trying out different males as a breeder

686
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:52,480
who makes a lot of regular seeds i need

687
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:55,038
to have solid males in my garden and i

688
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:57,679
have to have a revolving stable of

689
00:23:55,038 --> 00:23:59,839
quality females i try to keep a couple

690
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:01,519
i'm limited on numbers so i keep a

691
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:04,079
percentage of my numbers for a male

692
00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:05,599
plant a percentage for solid keeper

693
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:07,759
females and then a percentage of my

694
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:09,439
numbers go for rotating plants something

695
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:11,359
that's going to come and go like i

696
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,880
usually have a list of this many and

697
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:14,399
when i get a new plant i go where does

698
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,080
it fit in the list who's got to go and

699
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,600
the one on the bottom of the list that

700
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:18,720
plant gets kicked out and the new ones

701
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:22,399
come in

702
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:23,440
so uh if i were to only make feminized

703
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,278
seeds

704
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,679
then i wouldn't even worry about boys

705
00:24:25,278 --> 00:24:29,278
and we would be searching for the best

706
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:31,440
females all the time and i would just

707
00:24:29,278 --> 00:24:33,359
breed stuff and find i would grow it

708
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,798
first which i normally do and i would

709
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:36,319
find the winners out of there and then i

710
00:24:34,798 --> 00:24:38,240
would send out the seeds and let you

711
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:40,000
guys grow it next but i would be one or

712
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,079
two steps ahead of you breeding with the

713
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,679
new [ __ ] that you don't have yet so that

714
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:45,119
i'm ahead of everybody just a couple of

715
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:46,880
steps which is honestly kind of what i

716
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:48,639
do with my own line anyway

717
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,320
uh but if i were only to make femmes

718
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,640
yeah we would be searching out a bunch

719
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:54,558
of badass females and then just breed

720
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:57,200
each female to every female if i had a

721
00:24:54,558 --> 00:24:58,960
list of six girls i take number one and

722
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,558
pollinate everybody else with it and

723
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,400
then we take number two and pollinate

724
00:25:00,558 --> 00:25:04,000
everybody else and take number three

725
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,000
pollinate everybody else just reverse

726
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,839
that plant pollinate everybody with it

727
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,400
is what we would have to do

728
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:11,359
but i like making red seeds i really

729
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,120
like

730
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:15,439
i like breeding i like watching what the

731
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:17,839
boy does to the plants to the mix to the

732
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,440
recipe i kind of like that part so i

733
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:21,599
like the boys and the mix i love

734
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,919
feminized seeds also but there's just

735
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:26,158
something about a male female cross

736
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:27,840
being a breeder being somebody who's

737
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:29,760
deeply curious and passionate about

738
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:31,678
genetics and breeding that boy plant

739
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:32,558
means a lot to me so you have to have

740
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:35,278
both

741
00:25:32,558 --> 00:25:37,038
uh the males are what separate us from

742
00:25:35,278 --> 00:25:38,720
each other we are male as kind of like

743
00:25:37,038 --> 00:25:41,440
our style it's like our calling card

744
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:43,600
it's our flavor uh it's our catchphrase

745
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:46,159
or whatever you want to say uh it's what

746
00:25:43,599 --> 00:25:48,558
yeah that's the male is what does it uh

747
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:50,400
and one male can do a lot of work just

748
00:25:48,558 --> 00:25:52,720
like a reversed female can do a lot of

749
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,320
work but if you've got nine females in

750
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,720
the room pollinate all nine of those

751
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:59,038
females from that one male and make nine

752
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,480
crosses from one dude uh sometimes

753
00:25:59,038 --> 00:26:02,000
that's how i do it with king solomon

754
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,000
i'll put him in the room

755
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,679
with just the whole stable of ladies and

756
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
let him go buck wild he may be in a

757
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:10,159
greenhouse right now getting frisky with

758
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,400
like 12 beautiful ladies so he's got a

759
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:13,520
hot hot [ __ ] weekend all right let me

760
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,960
keep moving because i am kind of

761
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:16,400
rambling

762
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,759
where are we

763
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,360
um

764
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:21,519
it goes on i have to find my place

765
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:23,439
furthermore it says furthermore knowing

766
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:25,359
that the market doesn't want male plants

767
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:27,200
or most of the market would it make

768
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:30,558
sense for breeders to start charging

769
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:33,440
more not less for regular seed

770
00:26:30,558 --> 00:26:34,558
production um it is common i said

771
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,440
comment i'm going to put the bunch of

772
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:38,399
c's across the screen again it is common

773
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,880
that

774
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:43,120
feminized seeds are usually double the

775
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,799
price of regular seeds if you look at my

776
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:48,000
website if you look at most of my seed

777
00:26:44,798 --> 00:26:51,119
vendors a regular pack of seeds is 80

778
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,599
bucks a feminized pack of seeds is 80

779
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:56,239
bucks in the regular seeds it's a 10

780
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:59,839
pack and the femme seeds it's a six pack

781
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:02,400
they're almost double the price so

782
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:04,480
um that is because i said earlier it

783
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,480
takes more work much more work in my

784
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:09,759
opinion and in my experience to make a

785
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:11,839
feminized seed you've got to treat that

786
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:13,919
donor the pollen donor plant you've got

787
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:16,079
to treat it it's got to be treated with

788
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:18,000
a specific way for about three or four

789
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:19,918
weeks before you're going to make it a

790
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,319
plant that will give you pollen then

791
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:24,320
once it does reverse sometimes they

792
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:26,240
don't make very much pollen depending on

793
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:28,720
how your recipe was you've got to adjust

794
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:30,240
the recipe perfect that dial that in if

795
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,839
you didn't get it right you may have

796
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,278
just done a full run and not produced

797
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:35,359
enough pollen you got a bunch of buds

798
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:36,880
with very minimal seeds kind of wasted a

799
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:38,479
whole run there so

800
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,480
you got to dial it in you got to get it

801
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:42,319
right that's why femme seeds are more

802
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:45,519
expensive and regular seeds are

803
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:46,558
generally half the price and then on top

804
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:48,398
of that

805
00:27:46,558 --> 00:27:51,278
regular seeds are one price

806
00:27:48,398 --> 00:27:53,519
fem seeds are double and then autoflower

807
00:27:51,278 --> 00:27:55,519
fem seeds are double that price so

808
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:57,759
you're paying a lot more for your

809
00:27:55,519 --> 00:27:59,918
autoflowers let me keep reading because

810
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:01,919
there is more to this it says it is an

811
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:03,840
interesting thing to think about that i

812
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:06,960

821

823
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:31,759

825
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:36,640

827
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:41,360
true stud he's a winner um i put a lot

828
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:43,119
of work dedication time energy and

829
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:44,398
effort into finding that dude so i'm

830
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:46,000
glad it paid off

831
00:28:44,398 --> 00:28:47,599
i had to name him solomon if you

832
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,440
understand anything about solomon and

833
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:51,278
why he's named solomon big up maybe

834
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,120
he'll do some research now there's a

835
00:28:51,278 --> 00:28:55,119
reason for that name then it says what

836
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:56,398
do you think uh man i gave a lot of

837
00:28:55,119 --> 00:28:58,479
insight i hope you know what i think by

838
00:28:56,398 --> 00:29:01,199
now then it says lastly i think you

839
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:02,798
should redo and re-release a lot of your

840
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:05,679
early grow instructions there are a

841
00:29:02,798 --> 00:29:07,278
bunch of new people and way more podcast

842
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:09,759
competition than he mentions his

843
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:11,599
mentions i said mentions is he mentions

844
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:12,398
some of my podcast competition let me

845
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:13,759
say this

846
00:29:12,398 --> 00:29:15,439
i don't feel that anybody out there

847
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:16,798
podcasting is competition we're all

848
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,038
friends we're all bros we're all doing

849
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:20,879
the same thing we've got the same exact

850
00:29:19,038 --> 00:29:22,640
goal our goal is to make you a better

851
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,080
grower to give you better knowledge to

852
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,000
make you more comfortable in the grow

853
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:27,599
room more comfortable with your plants i

854
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,159
don't feel it uh competitive any

855
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:31,678
competition i see that word um twice in

856
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:33,840
this sentence here so

857
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:35,759
no competition dude it's all love it's

858
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:38,639
all respect but yes there are so many

859
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:40,000
more podcasts out there um

860
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,640
now let's revisit the point of that

861
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:45,200
sentence redoing and re-releasing a lot

862
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:47,278
of the old episodes i would love to do

863
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,679
that i will work on doing that but i get

864
00:29:47,278 --> 00:29:53,119
so many messages and questions that

865
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:54,720
redoing stuff uh sometimes is uh it's on

866
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:56,239
the back burner keeping up with the

867
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,159
current content the current questions

868
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:00,240
that is important staying on top of the

869
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:02,000
patreon questions those people do pay me

870
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,440
to answer their questions i feel like

871
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,919
that is priority i always print out the

872
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:08,080
patreon questions bang those out first

873
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:09,600
then i work my way to older questions

874
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:13,119
stuff that's just on my mind that i want

875
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:15,678
to ramble about stuff like that so um i

876
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:17,439
will redo those episodes over time i did

877
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:19,038
the cloning episode

878
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,720
i did the bottom and lollipopping

879
00:30:19,038 --> 00:30:22,558
episode those were just kind of redos of

880
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,679
episodes as well another thing you can

881
00:30:22,558 --> 00:30:25,599
do if you don't want to wait for the

882
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:27,038
redos you can always go back and listen

883
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:28,558
to the old episodes if you're an old

884
00:30:27,038 --> 00:30:31,038
listener a new listener if you've just

885
00:30:28,558 --> 00:30:33,278
discovered the podcast please do feel

886
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:34,558
free to dive into the old catalog of

887
00:30:33,278 --> 00:30:36,720
episodes there's a lot of great

888
00:30:34,558 --> 00:30:39,759
knowledge uh go check out the way that

889
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:41,919
the podcast has changed uh just grown

890
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:42,879
over time first it was really scripted i

891
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:44,399
wrote down

892
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,000
most of what i was gonna say was on

893
00:30:44,398 --> 00:30:47,359
paper and i would just read it and just

894
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,038
[ __ ] do the show like that and then

895
00:30:47,359 --> 00:30:50,639
it got more comfortable and then i hit

896
00:30:49,038 --> 00:30:52,240
my head there's a chunk of episodes

897
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,759
where i've got i'm recovering and

898
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,839
dealing with a traumatic brain injury

899
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:57,839
and a lot of weirdness those episodes

900
00:30:55,839 --> 00:30:59,519
are really interesting to listen to uh

901
00:30:57,839 --> 00:31:01,759
and then just over time things change

902
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:03,839
and then we had a pandemic which taught

903
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:05,839
me a lot about podcasting and that's

904
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:07,038
when i went to video so go listen to the

905
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:08,480
old stuff that's what i'm saying a lot

906
00:31:07,038 --> 00:31:10,640
of the lessons you're looking for a lot

907
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:13,360
of questions you guys might have may be

908
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:15,919
hidden in those old episodes and i will

909
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:18,158
over time redo them i'm slowly they're

910
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:20,320
slowly organically re-happening the

911
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:22,559
winter stuff i just talked about i'm

912
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:24,720
sure i've said a lot of that in an old

913
00:31:22,558 --> 00:31:27,038
episode before so a lot of it will get

914
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,720
repeated recycled i felt kind of weird

915
00:31:27,038 --> 00:31:30,240
about doing repeats and recycled

916
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,319
episodes but a lot of people have asked

917
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,319
the same questions and i'm realizing

918
00:31:32,319 --> 00:31:36,720
that a lot of podcast listeners you

919
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:38,240
either do or you do not go listen to old

920
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,319
episodes if you listen to old episodes

921
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:42,159
you start at number one and you listen

922
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:43,759
all the way up to the current or you

923
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:45,840
just start where you are that's kind of

924
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:47,839
how podcast viewers and listeners are

925
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:49,918
two types of podcast viewers i love you

926
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:51,599
both i got no judgment but uh they

927
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:53,679
either go all the way back or they don't

928
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:55,038
so we got to redo a lot of stuff again i

929
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:56,159
do invite you to go to listen to that

930
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:58,960
