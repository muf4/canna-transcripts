greats

137
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:02,089
mr. Ralphie may one of the best

138
00:05:00,389 --> 00:05:04,560
comedians on the planet in my opinion

139
00:05:02,089 --> 00:05:06,659
Ralphie May passed of cardiac arrest

140
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,970
Ralphie may have been struggling with

141
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:12,000
pneumonia if you know Ralphie May he was

142
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:13,470
also quite large he had been cleaning up

143
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,569
his act he was eating better he was off

144
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:16,969

145
00:05:15,569 --> 00:05:18,649
out with Joey Diaz and did

146
00:05:16,968 --> 00:05:20,298
he shows in Las Vegas he was a resident

147
00:05:18,649 --> 00:05:20,798
comedian in Vegas and they found him

148
00:05:20,298 --> 00:05:23,538
dead

149
00:05:20,798 --> 00:05:25,848
shallots Ralphie May I did get to see

150
00:05:23,538 --> 00:05:28,519
Ralphie at comedy work South not the

151
00:05:25,848 --> 00:05:30,978
small downtown club I think my first

152
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:33,168
Comedy Works experience but was either

153
00:05:30,978 --> 00:05:34,519
Doug Benson or Ralphie may I not sure

154
00:05:33,168 --> 00:05:36,948
which one happened first

155
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:38,959
but Ralphie mate was a great show there

156
00:05:36,949 --> 00:05:42,439
was a heckler in that show and I've

157
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:45,348
never seen a comedian [ __ ] destroy a

158
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:47,749
heckler like that Ralphie may must have

159
00:05:45,348 --> 00:05:49,338
planned he it was like he know that like

160
00:05:47,749 --> 00:05:50,929

00:05:58,158 --> 00:06:01,998
the bowling lane got a [ __ ] strike

166
00:05:59,869 --> 00:06:03,949
and then took a breath and back to my

167
00:06:01,999 --> 00:06:05,629
bit now and just [ __ ] crushed his act

168
00:06:03,949 --> 00:06:07,848
just like he was like he didn't yeah he

169
00:06:05,629 --> 00:06:09,319
didn't miss a [ __ ] beat Ralphie mate

170
00:06:07,848 --> 00:06:10,968
was known as a partier Ralphie may like

171
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:13,519
to eat some mushrooms and smoke a little

172
00:06:10,968 --> 00:06:16,819
weed one of my favorite Joey cocoa Diez

173
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:17,838
stories involves Ralphie baby I'm just

174
00:06:16,819 --> 00:06:18,499
gonna summarize here because it's a

175
00:06:17,838 --> 00:06:20,329
great story

176
00:06:18,499 --> 00:06:22,610
hi and if you don't listen to anything

177
00:06:20,329 --> 00:06:24,348
with Joey Diaz you should he's offensive

178
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:25,218
so be forewarned I hope you like it as

179
00:06:24,348 --> 00:06:27,438
much as I do

180
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:30,769
Joey Diaz tells a story about performing

181
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:31,999
in a comedy club and a girl had cocaine

182
00:06:30,769 --> 00:06:33,918
and if you know anything about Joey Diaz

183
00:06:31,999 --> 00:06:35,419
and cocaine I think he was more into the

184
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:37,639
cocaine than the girl but this girl had

185
00:06:35,418 --> 00:06:39,558
some cocaine and he took her into a

186
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:42,379
walk-in freezer in this restaurant and

187
00:06:39,559 --> 00:06:43,969
he says I was eating a monkey he was

188
00:06:42,379 --> 00:06:46,069
putting coke rocks in her vagina and

189
00:06:43,968 --> 00:06:48,408
snorting them out and they got caught by

190
00:06:46,069 --> 00:06:49,519
the manager he was smooth enough to

191
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:51,678
stick the bag of coke

192
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:53,059
I don't promote drug use but this is

193
00:06:51,678 --> 00:06:54,438
what Joey does and he's a [ __ ] adult

194
00:06:53,059 --> 00:06:56,269
so Joey

195
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:59,119
steals the cocaine and sticks it in a

196
00:06:56,269 --> 00:07:00,829
sock and dips and he runs upstairs and

197
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:02,539
he tells Joe Rogan a rogue and I just

198
00:07:00,829 --> 00:07:04,158
got myself in trouble I need to get the

199
00:07:02,538 --> 00:07:05,389
[ __ ] out of here Joe Rogan hands him a

200
00:07:04,158 --> 00:07:08,329
hundred dollar bill and tells him good

201
00:07:05,389 --> 00:07:09,079
luck bro so Joey Di starts walking on

202
00:07:08,329 --> 00:07:10,158
the street like you're gonna get the

203
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:11,959
[ __ ] out of here I'm not sure what I'm

204
00:07:10,158 --> 00:07:13,759
gonna do and Ralphie May drives by or

205
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:15,559
walks by and he tells him Ralphie get

206
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,209
the car jack get the car and he's like

207
00:07:15,559 --> 00:07:19,039
Coco I got [ __ ] to do and he's like get

208
00:07:17,209 --> 00:07:20,899
the [ __ ] car jack and so finally

209
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:22,399
[ __ ] Ralphie gets the car and picks up

210
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:25,538
uncle Joey and they drive off and

211
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:27,769
[ __ ] Ralphie May rescued uncle Joey

212
00:07:25,538 --> 00:07:29,300
that's one of their many stories they've

213
00:07:27,769 --> 00:07:30,240
told together on the podcast but that's

214
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:34,410
a crazy

215
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:36,750
glad my life paths never took me into

216
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:38,789
their life paths because honestly like I

217
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:41,339
think I would throw myself down that

218
00:07:38,788 --> 00:07:43,889
path a lot harder than is survivable I

219
00:07:41,339 --> 00:07:46,348
got lucky I purposefully ducked pretty

220
00:07:43,889 --> 00:07:50,069
much everything but weed in psychedelics

221
00:07:46,348 --> 00:07:52,709
until I knew myself well enough to know

222
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:54,210
that anything that picked me up and gave

223
00:07:52,709 --> 00:07:55,799
me a bunch more energy was something I

224
00:07:54,209 --> 00:07:58,318
needed a [ __ ] away from yeah I don't

225
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,910
like those kind of feelings psychedelics

226
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,199
were my friend for quite a while of

227
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:02,789
course I went to a bunch of fish shows

228
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,919
and I'm a Deadhead and I'm into that

229
00:08:02,788 --> 00:08:07,168
side of life so I've I've done my fair

230
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:11,668
share of DMT and more than my I've done

231
00:08:07,168 --> 00:08:13,709
your share of LSD along with mine I've

232
00:08:11,668 --> 00:08:15,568
done a lot of people if you never done

233
00:08:13,709 --> 00:08:16,829
acid and you're not into it I did yours

234
00:08:15,569 --> 00:08:18,389
for you you'll be just fine

235
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:20,490
don't worry somebody had that handle

236
00:08:18,389 --> 00:08:22,710
yeah but that was like the 90s and early

237
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:24,538
2000s and [ __ ] so that's way in the past

238
00:08:22,709 --> 00:08:26,339
but I never got into like the cocaine

239
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:28,019
and the other weird drugs like the

240
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:30,060
psychedelics I like to be [ __ ] whoo

241
00:08:28,019 --> 00:08:32,458
and I don't feel like that I never

242
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:33,658
thought those were is uh I don't know I

243
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:35,848
never saw people digging through

244
00:08:33,658 --> 00:08:39,179
dumpsters to get a hit acid you know

245
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:40,110
right that's not you don't get it what

246
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:41,429
are you gonna do Friday I'm gonna need

247
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:42,690
some acid we can do Monday I'm gonna be

248
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:45,899
back to a normal person and go to work

249
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:48,270
right I have to keep my job up so that

250
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:49,620
my apartment can still be mine yeah yeah

251
00:08:48,269 --> 00:08:51,208
but when you're playing in the band and

252
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:54,000
they're paying you an acid then it gets

253
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:55,649
a little those lines blur I that's one

254
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,230
of the things that like non-drug

255
00:08:55,649 --> 00:09:00,870
consuming people often don't realize is

256
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:03,028
that like 98 percent of drug consumers

257
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:05,879
you would have no idea consume drugs

258
00:09:03,028 --> 00:09:07,980
right like beet because they just do it

259
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:11,100
occasionally recreationally it's not

260
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:14,310
something that drives their existence or

261
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:15,389
that they promote regularly everybody's

262
00:09:14,309 --> 00:09:17,399
got a job everybody's got

263
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:20,159
responsibilities we've got a friend who

264
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:21,809
has a name that is a name of an

265
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:23,399
inanimate object and his name got

266
00:09:21,809 --> 00:09:24,689
brought up today and somebody was

267
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:26,070
actually talking about the inanimate

268
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:28,980
object and somebody's like do you mean

269
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:30,629
this guy and I'm not no I'm an object

270
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:32,519
not person but it's funny that you say

271
00:09:30,629 --> 00:09:34,559
that that guy's [ __ ] cool oh you know

272
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:36,449
him and they started talking about his

273
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:38,099
rampant drug use and I was like yeah

274
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:39,900
dude does a bunch of [ __ ] drugs but

275
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,909
you'd never know he goes to work he's

276
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:43,350
not a piece-of-shit drug user but and

277
00:09:41,909 --> 00:09:43,909
that person had to think about their

278
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:46,220
what their

279
00:09:43,909 --> 00:09:47,719
yeah you know what he does do every drug

280
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:49,129
on the [ __ ] planet but he doesn't lie

281
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,750
cheat or steal and he's not like

282
00:09:49,129 --> 00:09:52,939
addicted anything he just does drugs on

283
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:55,340
Friday he gets really [ __ ] up every

284
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:57,050
Friday on throughout the week he

285
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:58,879
maintains a [ __ ] life but the only

286
00:09:57,049 --> 00:10:01,789
one anybody ever discusses or that

287
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:05,360
anybody really sees out in public is

288
00:10:01,789 --> 00:10:08,719
booze like everyone knows 50 people that

289
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:10,850
drink regularly fairly heavily but it

290
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,790
doesn't influence or [ __ ] up their life

291
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:15,139
in any dramatic ways like sure [ __ ]

292
00:10:13,789 --> 00:10:16,969
might be a little better if they didn't

293
00:10:15,139 --> 00:10:18,980
do that but they get up every morning

294
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:20,629
they go to work they come home they have

295
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:22,250
dinner on the table for the family they

296
00:10:20,629 --> 00:10:24,379
go to bed they get up and do it all

297
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:25,940
again the next day they go fishing on

298
00:10:24,379 --> 00:10:28,549
the weekends or to Little League or

299
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:30,050
whatever the [ __ ] and no one no one has

300
00:10:28,549 --> 00:10:32,359
any issue with it because it's not

301
00:10:30,049 --> 00:10:35,179
impacting anyone else yep just in a

302
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:36,590
negative way they're maintaining and you

303
00:10:35,179 --> 00:10:40,039
see it all the time with regular like

304
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:41,840
that's why hey I was watching a bunch of

305
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:43,669
anti-pot videos yesterday so it's kind

306
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:47,690
of on my mind but why are you watching

307
00:10:43,669 --> 00:10:48,829
anti-pot videos know your enemy okay you

308
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:50,240
have to know what they're talking about

309
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:52,610
so you know it's gonna pop up on our

310
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,500
radar is the shitty anti pop people are

311
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:56,389
railing about today is the stuff we're

312
00:10:54,500 --> 00:11:00,860
dealing with in regulation 18 months

313
00:10:56,389 --> 00:11:03,980
from now okay but they don't understand

314
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:05,690
it all the history here or the the

315
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:08,300
numbers involved in the number of people

316
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:10,970
involved um when you listen to him rant

317
00:11:08,299 --> 00:11:13,490
as far as you can tell marijuana is

318
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:16,340
something we invented around 2000 like

319
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:19,789
99 2000 it just appeared we manufactured

320
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:22,250
this high THC cush yeah a bunch of

321
00:11:19,789 --> 00:11:24,559
people who wanted to get rich off an

322
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:26,960
addiction for-profit industry just and

323
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:28,459
showed up with it and started marketing

324
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:30,590

390
00:13:56,568 --> 00:14:00,948
past 250 episodes bro remember when we

391
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:03,379
started this and it sounded like it

392
00:14:00,948 --> 00:14:05,419
sound like this in the background won't

393
00:14:03,379 --> 00:14:06,769
sound like that yeah yeah we didn't have

394
00:14:05,419 --> 00:14:08,419
any compression everything sounded like

395
00:14:06,769 --> 00:14:10,278
[ __ ] and now we got there was none of

396
00:14:08,419 --> 00:14:11,990
these blinking lights to look at I

397
00:14:10,278 --> 00:14:14,059
couldn't watch the green bubbles go up

398
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:16,430
and down with the level of my voice and

399
00:14:14,059 --> 00:14:18,878
now we sound all smooth like we are NPR

400
00:14:16,429 --> 00:14:21,828
and it sounds nice and crisp

401
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:23,509
even like big-name people that do

402
00:14:21,828 --> 00:14:26,899
podcasting now when I listen to most

403

652
00:22:44,369 --> 00:22:48,178
were using to make their yeah a lot of

653
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:49,740
the things I would see online I would I

654
00:22:48,179 --> 00:22:51,090

695
00:23:53,759 --> 00:24:00,058
but I am not paid by any nutrient

696
00:23:57,929 --> 00:24:01,919

00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,940
from anybody right now honestly for this

699
00:24:04,288 --> 00:24:07,979
mod you guys can hear it in the show

700
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:10,379
like if you listened to other shows you

701
00:24:07,979 --> 00:24:12,028
can tell when someone's a brought to you

702
00:24:10,378 --> 00:24:13,949
by cheeseburgers that's part of what

703
00:24:12,028 --> 00:24:17,098
inspired this podcast also there was

704
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:19,019
another weed podcast bit in the first

705
00:24:17,098 --> 00:24:20,878
half of the episode he would read emails

706
00:24:19,019 --> 00:24:22,618
well I've got spider mites what do I do

707
00:24:20,878 --> 00:24:24,329
and he'd he'd say well I would go to the

708
00:24:22,618 --> 00:24:25,678
store and buy product a and then turn

709
00:24:24,329 --> 00:24:27,509
off the lights and spray the [ __ ] out of

710
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:29,369
product and your problem will be gone

711
00:24:27,509 --> 00:24:30,960
and then he would go on and act like the

712
00:24:29,368 --> 00:24:32,519
show is natural and then 30 minutes

713
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,838
minutes into the show they'd go well now

714
00:24:32,519 --> 00:24:35,519
we're gonna take a break and then the ad

715
00:24:33,838 --> 00:24:37,798
would come up this podcast brought to

716
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:39,179
you by product a like oh is that why you

717
00:24:37,798 --> 00:24:40,618
recommended product at the start of the

718
00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:42,778
[ __ ] show because they paid you money

719
00:24:40,618 --> 00:24:44,218
it was a fake email nobody had that

720
00:24:42,778 --> 00:24:45,269
problem you made that [ __ ] up so that

721
00:24:44,219 --> 00:24:46,440
you could pitch that product to make

722
00:24:45,269 --> 00:24:47,819
somebody I don't do that you guys I

723
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:49,649
don't yeah I'm not trying to make some

724
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:50,668
money off of products oh I want you to

725
00:24:49,648 --> 00:24:52,678
be able to do it for free if it's

726
00:24:50,669 --> 00:24:55,259
possible I'll tell you what I use and

727
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:57,269
you didn't use that and it's not know

728
00:24:55,259 --> 00:24:59,579
here's the tips and tricks that he's

729
00:24:57,269 --> 00:25:02,038
using personally and it's in since

730
00:24:59,579 --> 00:25:04,199
success with it's not getting

731
00:25:02,038 --> 00:25:06,118
recommended because there's a percentage

732
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,889
on it yeah it's totally what I would use

733
00:25:06,118 --> 00:25:10,009
like I mentioned like products like

734
00:25:07,888 --> 00:25:11,998
grande Evo and evergreen and cease

735
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:13,950
things like that we actually use in

736
00:25:11,999 --> 00:25:15,659
commercial cultivation facilities that's

737
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:17,340
what I would recommend all of the time

738
00:25:15,659 --> 00:25:19,560
well it's today

739
00:25:17,339 --> 00:25:21,109
we had a guy ask you what what do you

740
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:25,919
think about ladybugs

741
00:25:21,109 --> 00:25:27,719
you gave verbatim the same answer I mean

742
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:30,150
not work forward but incredibly close

743
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:32,519
that you gave on the podcast three four

744
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:34,530
months ago yeah here's what we use

745
00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:36,569
here's where you can get them here's why

746
00:25:34,529 --> 00:25:39,180
this superior to ladybugs yeah because

747
00:25:36,569 --> 00:25:41,039
in the Doozers blown away his eyes got

748
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:42,539
really big and I could see them like it

749
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:45,480
seemed to take his phone out and start

750
00:25:42,539 --> 00:25:47,039
writing [ __ ] down yeah ladybugs are cute

751
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:49,410
you guys but most of them end up in your

752
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:51,720
ducting and in your shop vac ladybugs

753
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:53,220
are they're great for photography but I

754
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,930
don't think they're gonna do it get some

755
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:56,730
sworsky mites those are gonna do you

756
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:58,320

767
00:26:13,859 --> 00:26:17,849
into this podcast it sounds like you

768
00:26:15,299 --> 00:26:19,319
just hit record and you talk but I've

769
00:26:17,849 --> 00:26:20,549
got pages and pages of notes and

770
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:21,990
thousands of dollars in gear so there's

771
00:26:20,549 --> 00:26:24,299
a lot going into it so it's good to know

772
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:26,490
that it's worth all the effort to you

773
00:26:24,299 --> 00:26:28,470
guys sometimes we do just get really

774
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:30,480
high in hit record but the only reason

775
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:31,950
we're able to do that is cuz two years

776
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,839
of homework went into being able to do

777
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:35,190
that yeah this isn't gonna be one of

778
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:37,349
those shows where you need to get out

779
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:39,090
your notebook this is not gonna be one

780
00:26:37,349 --> 00:26:42,509
we could turn it into one but it'd be a

781
00:26:39,089 --> 00:26:47,099
real dick move it doesn't just hide it

782
00:26:42,509 --> 00:26:48,809
at the end make it like any super tricks

783
00:26:47,099 --> 00:26:50,429
no no we're not gonna do that to you

784
00:26:48,809 --> 00:26:52,529

786
00:26:52,529 --> 00:26:55,379

second one has a packet of emergency in

792
00:27:04,259 --> 00:27:08,490
it vitamin C in electrolytes and then I

793
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:11,069
ate a bowl of noodles and a handful of

794
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:12,089
snacks and that really put me back on my

795
00:27:11,069 --> 00:27:13,559
game and then just getting talking

796
00:27:12,089 --> 00:27:15,179

804

00:27:32,878 --> 00:27:36,089
years and all the people who were

809
00:27:34,618 --> 00:27:40,228
thinking about emailing the show in the

810
00:27:36,089 --> 00:27:41,878
future the last couple episodes like I

811
00:27:40,229 --> 00:27:43,979

818
00:27:58,229 --> 00:28:02,190
we're heavy email-based

819
00:27:59,489 --> 00:28:04,200
were really really good I loved the

820
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:07,019
parenting show and I know that's not a

821
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:08,788
show that dawns on you without that

822
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:10,169
prompt from the the listener and it's

823
00:28:08,788 --> 00:28:11,548
not exactly I wouldn't have called you

824
00:28:10,169 --> 00:28:13,409
and been like dude let's do a parenting

825
00:28:11,548 --> 00:28:14,819
show right even though I'm a new parent

826
00:28:13,409 --> 00:28:16,320
yeah I'm thinking about that [ __ ] all

827
00:28:14,819 --> 00:28:17,608
the time I had a couple of friends who

828
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:19,288
are parents they're like what the [ __ ]

829
00:28:17,608 --> 00:28:21,538
dude I should have been on that show yep

830
00:28:19,288 --> 00:28:23,158
like and I know I know but I I know

831
00:28:21,538 --> 00:28:24,658
sometimes I can't I can't get everybody

832
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:27,059
on the podcast all the time sometimes

833
00:28:24,659 --> 00:28:28,528
honestly I want sure I know what day I

834
00:28:27,058 --> 00:28:30,148
wanna record my goal is to record on

835
00:28:28,528 --> 00:28:31,710
Thursday I liked it but sometimes it'll

836
00:28:30,148 --> 00:28:32,998
be Tuesday night and I can't sleep and

837
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:34,649
I'll be [ __ ] it here we go and I'll just

838
00:28:32,999 --> 00:28:36,239
get a record a show at midnight and I'll

839
00:28:34,648 --> 00:28:38,819
just record it just because I'm in the

840
00:28:36,239 --> 00:28:40,169
mood and I feel like podcasting is get

841
00:28:38,819 --> 00:28:41,548
maybe maybe not everybody would feel

842
00:28:40,169 --> 00:28:42,929
this way I feel like it's kind of like

843
00:28:41,548 --> 00:28:44,128
music it's kind of like an art and if

844
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:45,509
I'm in the mood to do it I should do it

845
00:28:44,128 --> 00:28:47,339
cuz it's gonna come out way better than

846
00:28:45,509 --> 00:28:48,659
when I'm not in the mood I'm sure you

847
00:28:47,339 --> 00:28:50,339

848
00:28:48,659 --> 00:28:53,129

hey it's working because like I'm gonna

905
00:30:45,779 --> 00:30:50,369
segue into my next bullet point nice and

906
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:54,538
smoothly here this week on stitcher we

907
00:30:50,369 --> 00:30:56,279
are ranked 595 fresh overall yeah there

908
00:30:54,538 --> 00:30:58,319
are a lot of shows on stitcher I was

909
00:30:56,279 --> 00:31:00,750
trying to research how many I in one

910
00:30:58,319 --> 00:31:03,869
section I saw 25,000 in another section

911
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:05,669
they boast 40,000 shows like 40,000

912
00:31:03,869 --> 00:31:07,139
titles of different shows are available

913
00:31:05,669 --> 00:31:08,520
on stitcher I don't know which is true

914
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:10,620
if somebody wants to do the real

915
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:12,418
research and find out and tweet me send

916
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:13,469
me a tweet it's @gf wih podcast let me

917
00:31:12,419 --> 00:31:15,210
know cuz that way I don't have to search

918
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:16,860
for it and I can put that energy into a

919
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:18,929
good show the part of that question I

920
00:31:16,859 --> 00:31:20,849
like is that for your show it doesn't

921
00:31:18,929 --> 00:31:22,798
matter so much if there are 20,000 or

922
00:31:20,849 --> 00:31:25,619
40,000 because you're better than all

923
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:29,079
about 540 M

924
00:31:25,619 --> 00:31:30,729
and also I was hyping myself up I was

925
00:31:29,079 --> 00:31:31,599
like I want to be on that top 100 but

926
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:34,059
then I thought about like we're a

927
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:37,779
cannabis show like we're a very niche

928
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:39,549
I've got a very niche show here it

929
00:31:37,779 --> 00:31:41,589
depends where you look at it the

930
00:31:39,549 --> 00:31:45,579
cannabis consuming population is

931
00:31:41,589 --> 00:31:47,740
somewhere between like 10 and 25% of the

932
00:31:45,579 --> 00:31:50,019
population is like everybody's good yes

933
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:52,210
my real guess is that you'll take a

934
00:31:50,019 --> 00:31:56,049
couple hits at a concert or yeah a few

935
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:57,460
times a year is closer to 40% but I mean

936
00:31:56,049 --> 00:31:59,079
even then that's why I kept pushing it

937
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:00,250
it's not like other [ __ ] that where

938
00:31:59,079 --> 00:32:02,679
they're pulling twenty million views a

939
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:05,109
week right the amount of people that

940
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:06,670
listen to podcasts and the amount of

941
00:32:05,109 --> 00:32:08,079
people that smoke cannabis and the

942
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:09,759
amount of people that actually give a

943
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:11,740
[ __ ] enough about cannabis to listen to

944
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:13,299
a podcast that's kind of a small pocket

945
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:16,150
right well there but one thing I've

946
00:32:13,299 --> 00:32:18,069
noticed my demographic is the exact same

947
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:18,970
on my Instagram feed as it is on my

948
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:21,279
podcast

949
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:23,980
most of the people are from Denver to

950
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:26,529
Los Angeles report hland and 80 percent

951
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:28,720
of them are men and most of them are men

952
00:32:26,529 --> 00:32:30,339
between length 21 and 35 it's mostly

953
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,440
who's listening to my podcast so what's

954
00:32:30,339 --> 00:32:33,939
up guys

955
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:36,250
hi ladies I don't have to leave you out

956
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:36,730
I got your female friends to listen to

957
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:38,319
the show

958
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:40,720
I get it I don't draw the ladies I'm not

959
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:42,429
a lady magnet that's alright with me if

960
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,130
they could see the Chewbacca costume I

961
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:47,019
think things would be different

962
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:48,760
anyway I was ranked we were ranked the

963
00:32:47,019 --> 00:32:51,129
show was ranked not me as my podcast

964
00:32:48,759 --> 00:32:53,769
who's number 39 and lifestyle and health

965
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:55,150
on stitcher radio yeah and number 39 and

966
00:32:53,769 --> 00:32:56,619

00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:13,299
about that they don't list you in a lot

975
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:16,089
of [ __ ] until you get a negative review

976
00:33:13,299 --> 00:33:17,319
because like who cares about all these

977
00:33:16,089 --> 00:33:18,490
positive reviews you have to get a

978
00:33:17,319 --> 00:33:21,309
negative one to fall under their

979
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:22,690
algorithm nobody knows yeah yeah because

980
00:33:21,309 --> 00:33:24,490

993
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:53,250
I've been putting out what I call the

994
00:33:51,509 --> 00:33:54,930
throwback Thursday episodes let me

995
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:57,029
explain how who what when where why and

996
00:33:54,930 --> 00:33:59,970
how I'm doing all that what happens is

997
00:33:57,029 --> 00:34:01,440
iTunes and stitcher hold 100 episodes in

998
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:03,240
the feed being that this is episode

999
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,830
number 250 that means there's a hundred

1000
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:06,359
and fifty episodes that you don't get to

1001
00:34:04,829 --> 00:34:08,009
listen to because they're not in the

1002
00:34:06,359 --> 00:34:08,519
feed what I'm doing for you because I

1003
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:11,220
love you guys

1004
00:34:08,519 --> 00:34:13,530
I'm making old episodes in two large

1005
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:16,859

1006
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:19,919

1007
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:21,750
love you anyhow I'm taking old episode

1008
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:24,929
really does give up his computer for

1009
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:27,659
like six hours per Thursday show so we

1010
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:29,579
can post that [ __ ] to all this all the

1011
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:31,110
streams cuz it's three three hours and

1012
00:34:29,579 --> 00:34:33,299
change usually like it's yeah the long

1013
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:36,300
show yeah it's usually like three maybe

1014
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:38,519
four sometimes five episodes ever back

1015
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:39,960
it's perfect yeah yeah and people that

1016
00:34:38,519 --> 00:34:42,239
have long jobs that are at work all day

1017
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:44,610
they love it but I take old episodes and

1018
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:46,739
I put them in chunks ah that way instead

1019
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:49,140
of putting one episode in the feed I can

1020
00:34:46,739 --> 00:34:50,459
give you like four episodes put them

1021
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:52,469
back into the feet and you can listen to

1022
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:54,148
that old [ __ ] without knocking out a

1023
00:34:52,469 --> 00:34:56,699
bunch of new content you get to go back

1024
00:34:54,148 --> 00:34:58,769
and listen so that's what's happening on

1025
00:34:56,699 --> 00:35:00,899
the Thursday shows so all the Thursday

1026
00:34:58,769 --> 00:35:03,059
episodes are old ah there's something

1027
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:04,860
else I want to mention and that but I

1028
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:07,019
don't know which order to do this also

1029
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:09,180
on YouTube I'm putting up old episodes

1030
00:35:07,019 --> 00:35:11,429
on YouTube because YouTube doesn't limit

1031
00:35:09,179 --> 00:35:12,839
how much content I put up by the time

1032
00:35:11,429 --> 00:35:14,179
this comes out there will be close to a

1033
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:16,650
hundred I kept saying a hundred episodes

1034
00:35:14,179 --> 00:35:18,419
episode 100 is scheduled to release

1035
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:20,010
within the next couple of days it's up

1036
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:21,990
there it's in my YouTube feed but it has

1037
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:23,850
not released it like 99 and 100 need to

1038
00:35:21,989 --> 00:35:25,169
come out but they're there so all I have

1039
00:35:23,849 --> 00:35:26,699
to do is wait for that scheduled time to

1040
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:29,400
come out I've got them set up on YouTube

1041
00:35:26,699 --> 00:35:32,159
to do that so check out the girl from a

1042
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:34,860
horror podcast YouTube channel the first

1043
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:36,449
20 shows are on the iGrow culture

1044
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:38,640
podcast channel remember when the show

1045
00:35:36,449 --> 00:35:40,679
is called I grow culture so when I first

1046
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:42,500
started you guys the first at first 50

1047
00:35:40,679 --> 00:35:46,619
episodes we were called I grow culture

1048
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:48,719
but there's apparently a

1049
00:35:46,619 --> 00:35:50,909
an educational program called

1050
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:53,309
agriculture that teaches college-level

1051
00:35:50,909 --> 00:35:55,230
agriculture courses and they didn't like

1052
00:35:53,309 --> 00:35:57,360
my little weed podcast ripping off their

1053
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:59,039
name though so we quickly changed that

1054
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:00,450
to the girl from your heart podcast once

1055
00:35:59,039 --> 00:36:01,650
we add resistant once they said hey

1056
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:03,359
we've already got that I was like a [ __ ]

1057
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:05,309
I don't want your name I want my own

1058
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,820
name I just didn't I googled it nothing

1059
00:36:05,309 --> 00:36:07,739
came up

1060
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:09,539
yeah there was there's no no harshness

1061
00:36:07,739 --> 00:36:11,729
they just send a little things saying

1062
00:36:09,539 --> 00:36:13,409
hey by the way that's already taken and

1063
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:15,210
we immediately started working on a new

1064
00:36:13,409 --> 00:36:16,889
name yeah and the next I was like on

1065
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:19,079
episode 50 we'll drop the new name and

1066
00:36:16,889 --> 00:36:21,900
we did that so the first 20 episodes are

1067
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:24,779
on the old agriculture feed 21 through

1068

been better than 44 if you know why he's

1122

called 44 anywho but there's a prize and

sub cool and team green Avengers and

1285

00:44:22,389 --> 00:44:26,319
am today without that inspiration and a

1288
00:44:24,519 --> 00:44:28,809
little bit of guidance we spent a lot of

1289
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:31,570
time watching so cool shows and just

1290
00:44:28,809 --> 00:44:33,369
learning absorbing learning to think of

1291
00:44:31,570 --> 00:44:35,170
things at different ways the first few

1292
00:44:33,369 --> 00:44:36,429
times he interacted with me on social

1293
00:44:35,170 --> 00:44:38,680
media I didn't know what to do with

1294
00:44:36,429 --> 00:44:40,659
myself I was like how do I reply to this

1295
00:44:38,679 --> 00:44:42,819
and alike take a moment as I I don't

1296
00:44:40,659 --> 00:44:44,769
think he even realizes how much he

1297
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:46,210
inspired me and how much he taught me

1298
00:44:44,769 --> 00:44:47,679
and how much I paid attention people

1299
00:44:46,210 --> 00:44:50,019
have called me mini-sub cool online

1300
00:44:47,679 --> 00:44:52,029

1301
00:44:50,019 --> 00:44:53,860
little while but we're similar uh and

1302
00:44:52,030 --> 00:44:55,870

1304
00:44:55,869 --> 00:45:01,719
getting to you guys is sub cool and miss

1305
00:44:58,599 --> 00:45:04,960
Jill had a very nice home in California

1306
00:45:01,719 --> 00:45:07,089
and the fires destroyed [ __ ]

1307
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:10,599
everything the wild fire in California

1308
00:45:07,090 --> 00:45:13,090
has burned down their entire house um so

1309
00:45:10,599 --> 00:45:15,940
far at this point in time sub does not

1310
00:45:13,090 --> 00:45:17,500
know if the safe that they closed just

1311
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:20,380
before they left they contained all of

1312
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:22,869
the TGA seeds that that safe could be

1313
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:24,039
destroyed they don't know if that exists

1314
00:45:22,869 --> 00:45:28,029
or not they can't get back to their

1315
00:45:24,039 --> 00:45:29,380
house so this is ongoing as it's not

1316
00:45:28,030 --> 00:45:30,940
something that happened already it's

1317
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:32,500
something that's happening yeah the

1318
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:34,000
house burned down a couple of nights ago

1319
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:36,699
they're staying in a hotel I don't know

1320
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,590
how much is putting it all on Instagram

1321
00:45:36,699 --> 00:45:40,359
live so this is all basically public

1322
00:45:38,590 --> 00:45:41,289
info and I want to send some love out to

1323
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:42,579
them it's basically what I'm trying to

1324
00:45:41,289 --> 00:45:45,579
gentleman you guys know what's going on

1325
00:45:42,579 --> 00:45:46,900
if you've ever so the sub can't get to

1326
00:45:45,579 --> 00:45:48,909
the house to find out if those seeds are

1327
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:52,329
even alive you guys the mother plants

1328
00:45:48,909 --> 00:45:54,609
that TGA breeds with burned in the fire

1329
00:45:52,329 --> 00:45:56,739
all of their plants them their plants

1330
00:45:54,610 --> 00:45:59,260
are gone they cannot make strains like

1331
00:45:56,739 --> 00:46:01,000
the void vortex it's all gone it's gone

1332
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:02,290
the mother plants that did that the male

1333
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,670
plant that did that that [ __ ] doesn't

1334
00:46:02,289 --> 00:46:06,309
exist anymore so they're gonna have to

1335
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:08,019
start from scratch unless one of their

1336
00:46:06,309 --> 00:46:11,349
friends has a clone of the space dude

1337
00:46:08,019 --> 00:46:13,269
because that was what did it all sub and

1338
00:46:11,349 --> 00:46:15,190
I were in talks of him sending me a

1339
00:46:13,269 --> 00:46:16,840
space dude that was just in that but

1340
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:18,099
that was kinda just that hasn't all

1341
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:19,840
evolved yet and we were gonna do a

1342
00:46:18,099 --> 00:46:21,400
collaboration together there's gonna be

1343
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:22,780
a space dude clone here I would have it

1344
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,619
I would have it to send back to him when

1345
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:25,780
he gets on his feet

1346
00:46:23,619 --> 00:46:27,460
it didn't happen yet [ __ ] sometimes

1347
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:29,230
timing is a [ __ ] sometimes nature is a

1348
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:32,019
[ __ ] because if you've ever grown

1349

00:47:01,829 --> 00:47:07,619
little nod toward TJ at least if you can

1364
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:09,838

1369
00:47:17,579 --> 00:47:19,530

1370
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:21,540
with this

1371
00:47:19,530 --> 00:47:23,760
Jill's taking it worse than sub cool

1372
00:47:21,539 --> 00:47:25,469
subs of [ __ ] soldier sub will not

1373
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:27,599
acknowledge that he's got feelings

1374
00:47:25,469 --> 00:47:28,858
because he's a big manly man honestly I

1375
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:30,869
would probably be playing the same

1376
00:47:28,858 --> 00:47:32,789
[ __ ] role a sub cool he's powering

1377
00:47:30,869 --> 00:47:34,858
forward and trying to work through it

1378
00:47:32,789 --> 00:47:36,420
and not deal with it and it's working

1379
00:47:34,858 --> 00:47:38,940
for him that's the way men deal with

1380
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:40,798
[ __ ] I get that Jill is not doing well

1381
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:42,990
she's gotta feel the way through it yeah

1382
00:47:40,798 --> 00:47:45,119
and she's been in a hotel room for

1383
00:47:42,989 --> 00:47:46,919
several days like guys like I'm a guy

1384

1387
00:47:49,829 --> 00:47:52,260
[ __ ] giant knot and we can go do

1389
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:56,099
Jill's a woman she needs her woman think

1390
00:47:54,358 --> 00:47:57,598
she clean clothes she needs makeup and

1391
00:47:56,099 --> 00:47:58,920
[ __ ] she doesn't have any of that it's

1392
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:00,298

00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:41,250
mean it's gonna be a really really

1441
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:42,960
really awkward October November December

1442
00:49:41,250 --> 00:49:44,699
this year they've been saying there's

1443
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:46,260
too much cannabis in California do you

1444
00:49:44,699 --> 00:49:50,219
think this will even it out wasn't

1445
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:52,890
between the mother nature all over the

1446
00:49:50,219 --> 00:49:55,519
place the fires in Cali the the humidity

1447
00:49:52,889 --> 00:49:57,719
and the moisture and the cold snap here

1448
00:49:55,519 --> 00:50:00,179
pretty much anywhere you grow cannabis

1449
00:49:57,719 --> 00:50:02,750
this year weather [ __ ] with you harder

1450
00:50:00,179 --> 00:50:04,799
in your last couple weeks of bloom

1451
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:08,659
that's gonna [ __ ] with the overall

1452
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:12,480
outdoor harvest this year coast to coast

1453
00:50:08,659 --> 00:50:16,069
Dave also in the last like two weeks

1454
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:18,360
they've busted three pretty large

1455
00:50:16,070 --> 00:50:19,860
illegal crows down here in southern

1456
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:22,410
Colorado they were doing the same thing

1457
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:24,059
in California I saw somewhere in Oregon

1458
00:50:22,409 --> 00:50:28,159
they busted like the biggest one they've

1459
00:50:24,059 --> 00:50:30,480
ever busted it was thousands of plants I

1460
00:50:28,159 --> 00:50:32,460
mean there's been a lot going after the

1461
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:34,139
crop at the end of this year who knows

1462
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:35,909
what we're looking at it's been a rough

1463
00:50:34,139 --> 00:50:37,889
year for cannabis growers too much there

1464
00:50:35,909 --> 00:50:40,769

outdoor grows they got busted here we're

1467
00:50:43,019 --> 00:50:47,579
all ran by cartels is what they're

1468
00:50:45,570 --> 00:50:51,510
claiming that's the headline but they

1469
00:50:47,579 --> 00:50:53,789
just say that okay um if anybody that

1470
00:50:51,510 --> 00:50:55,530
the gross speaks Spanish it's a cartel

1471
00:50:53,789 --> 00:50:58,259

Colorado and Washington and Oregon and

1502
00:52:07,099 --> 00:52:10,730
[ __ ] that you have to follow with

1503
00:52:08,269 --> 00:52:13,489
legalization but the one I don't mind so

1504
00:52:10,730 --> 00:52:15,710
much is keep it the [ __ ] locked up um

or three people that got ripped and are

1507
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:20,900

1508
00:52:18,889 --> 00:52:22,819
ripped and they're mad and they're

1509
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:24,650
hunting down people and they're on the

1510
00:52:22,820 --> 00:52:26,930
lookout for a [ __ ] vehicle and it's

1511
00:52:24,650 --> 00:52:29,539
like dude I [ __ ] told you to put it

1512
00:52:26,929 --> 00:52:31,099
inside and that I'm a cannabis grower I

1513
00:52:29,539 --> 00:52:32,449
was a cannabis grower before I should

1514
00:52:31,099 --> 00:52:34,579
admit being a cannabis girl I love

1515
00:52:32,449 --> 00:52:37,250
cannabis but that's the [ __ ] that is

1516
00:52:34,579 --> 00:52:39,650
keeping it illegal in places they're the

1517
00:52:37,250 --> 00:52:41,659
fear of that yeah yeah you know it's

1518
00:52:39,650 --> 00:52:44,780
these they're valuable plants you're

1519
00:52:41,659 --> 00:52:46,429
putting and you're just setting TVs out

1520
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:48,860
in the backyard basically you know what

1521
00:52:46,429 --> 00:52:51,109
I mean like motorcycles a little heavier

1522
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:52,789
you wouldn't create a can of spray paint

1523
00:52:51,110 --> 00:52:55,820
and spray paint on the front of your

1524
00:52:52,789 --> 00:52:58,279
house I've got ten grand and in cash in

1525
00:52:55,820 --> 00:52:59,330
the back poorly defended yeah you're

1526
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:02,690
setting bags of money out there

1527
00:52:59,329 --> 00:53:06,469
essential yeah I've got gold bars on my

1528
00:53:02,690 --> 00:53:08,119
back patio just so everyone knows like

1529
00:53:06,469 --> 00:53:10,579
you're putting a cannabis plant in your

1530
00:53:08,119 --> 00:53:12,549
backyard that creates a smell every

1531
00:53:10,579 --> 00:53:16,819
single teenager that walks by your house

1532
00:53:12,550 --> 00:53:19,250
from early August to late October knows

1533
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:21,019
you're growing every Ripper that's

1534
00:53:19,250 --> 00:53:23,269
driving up and down alleyways in

1535
00:53:21,019 --> 00:53:24,710
neighborhoods with one dude sitting in

1536
00:53:23,269 --> 00:53:26,239
the back of the pickup and one dude

1537
00:53:24,710 --> 00:53:28,250
going up to the doors offering lawn

1538
00:53:26,239 --> 00:53:30,849
service every now every couple houses so

1539
00:53:28,250 --> 00:53:32,260
they don't do shady all summer long

1540
00:53:30,849 --> 00:53:33,579
they've got a clipboard in the cab where

1541
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:35,650
they're marking down two dresses with

1542
00:53:33,579 --> 00:53:37,329
outdoor grills they can smell then they

1543
00:53:35,650 --> 00:53:39,760
come around in October and they clean

1544
00:53:37,329 --> 00:53:41,529
your [ __ ] out and it's the most

1545
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:43,900
predictable thing in the world it's one

1546
00:53:41,530 --> 00:53:45,930
of the main concerns everybody had under

1547
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:50,619
prohibition you were worried about

1548
00:53:45,929 --> 00:53:53,529
rippers and cops in that order

1549
00:53:50,619 --> 00:53:54,909
yep and now it's legal and everybody's

1550
00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:57,190
like I don't have to worry about the

1551
00:53:54,909 --> 00:53:59,199
cops and they completely forgot that

1552
00:53:57,190 --> 00:54:02,530
they were a secondary [ __ ] concern

1553
00:53:59,199 --> 00:54:04,389
ten years ago and the rippers are your

1554
00:54:02,530 --> 00:54:06,370
real problem you don't want to bring

1555
00:54:04,389 --> 00:54:09,879
that criminal element to your world

1556
00:54:06,369 --> 00:54:12,539
one dude penned over by where I used to

1557
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:15,070
live got shot to death in his front yard

1558
00:54:12,539 --> 00:54:17,139
because the three guys he brought in

1559
00:54:15,070 --> 00:54:19,390
from Oklahoma to buy his crop that he

1560
00:54:17,139 --> 00:54:22,210
couldn't move here decided they'd rather

1561
00:54:19,389 --> 00:54:23,829
shoot him and then pay for it like

1562
00:54:22,210 --> 00:54:25,300
that's part of the beauty of

1563
00:54:23,829 --> 00:54:26,500
legalization is we don't have to mess

1564
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:29,950
with anything that [ __ ] anymore people

1565
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:31,809
you want to narrate my dab it's a

1566
00:54:29,949 --> 00:54:35,319
quarter gram or so going into the

1567
00:54:31,809 --> 00:54:37,539
thermal banger with the Hitman sidecar

1568
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:39,720
right beneath it it's a little too hot

1569
00:54:37,539 --> 00:54:41,650
because Jeff doesn't like pool dabs

1570
00:54:39,719 --> 00:54:45,369

my patreon campaign patreon if you feel

1651
00:57:38,869 --> 00:57:42,529
like the podcast was worth a few bucks

00:57:40,489 --> 00:57:43,699
and you would like to contribute all you

1653
00:57:42,530 --> 00:57:47,090
have to do is go to a website called

to the podcast

1658
00:57:51,829 --> 00:57:55,130
no I'm not trying to get rich off my

1659
00:57:53,389 --> 00:57:58,449
podcast however I do have a proposition

1660
00:57:55,130 --> 00:57:58,450
coming up for you in a future episode

1661
00:57:59,110 --> 00:58:03,019
what patreon will allow you to do is

1662
00:58:01,159 --> 00:58:05,239
throw down a few dollars it does cost me

1663
00:58:03,019 --> 00:58:06,530
a few bucks to post to have a website I

1664
00:58:05,239 --> 00:58:08,269
host my podcast

1665
00:58:06,530 --> 00:58:09,680
on a website on the I read genetics

1666
00:58:08,269 --> 00:58:11,269
Colorado website don't go there it looks

1667
00:58:09,679 --> 00:58:12,889
like [ __ ] and it's embarrassing but it

1668
00:58:11,269 --> 00:58:14,539
does exist it's there it needs a lot of

1669
00:58:12,889 --> 00:58:17,000
love it hasn't been touched up in quite

1670
00:58:14,539 --> 00:58:18,529
a while I'm not a web guy somebody

1671
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:20,000
reached out to me and we may do some

1672
00:58:18,530 --> 00:58:22,910
work in the future but that's not what

1673
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:24,110
the topic is right now um anyway I have

1674
00:58:22,909 --> 00:58:25,579
to pay for that website to be there

1675
00:58:24,110 --> 00:58:27,380
that's how I host the show that's how I

1676
00:58:25,579 --> 00:58:29,000
give you the podcast for free I will

1677
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:30,559
happily pay for it out of my pocket if

1678
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:32,510
you think that you'd like to help out

1679
00:58:30,559 --> 00:58:34,400
send me a couple of bucks on the patreon

1680
00:58:32,510 --> 00:58:36,170

1681
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:37,220
also these little microphone covers that

1682
00:58:36,170 --> 00:58:39,650

1683
00:58:37,219 --> 00:58:41,509
[ __ ] in your headphones smells like

1684
00:58:39,650 --> 00:58:43,910
nothing which is a real pleasant change

1685
00:58:41,510 --> 00:58:45,710

1758
01:01:17,039 --> 01:01:21,389
platform I'm not good with it someone

1759
01:01:19,679 --> 01:01:22,710
one of the listeners I actually I've

1760
01:01:21,389 --> 01:01:25,009
been feeling a little guilty about this

1761
01:01:22,710 --> 01:01:27,269
so if you're listening now know that

1762
01:01:25,010 --> 01:01:30,450

1763
01:01:27,269 --> 01:01:32,429
Instagram asking about California law I

1764
01:01:30,449 --> 01:01:35,029
saw it while I was on break at work and

1765
01:01:32,429 --> 01:01:37,409
glanced at it was like oh I need to

1766
01:01:35,030 --> 01:01:39,840
check that out research for a few

1767
01:01:37,409 --> 01:01:41,129
minutes and get back to them I can't

1768
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:44,369
figure out how to bring that [ __ ] back

1769
01:01:41,130 --> 01:01:45,690
up on Instagram so please don't send me

1770
01:01:44,369 --> 01:01:47,309
stuff through there cuz I will lose it

1771
01:01:45,690 --> 01:01:49,380
and then feel guilty for months on end

1772
01:01:47,309 --> 01:01:50,759
but if that person is listening tonight

1773
01:01:49,380 --> 01:01:53,010

1774
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:54,510
slightly for months and send that

1775
01:01:53,010 --> 01:01:57,119

1837
01:04:11,619 --> 01:04:14,650
person who sent me a message on

1838
01:04:12,909 --> 01:04:16,059
Instagram like it seemed like a good

1839
01:04:14,650 --> 01:04:19,180
question it seemed like you cared a lot

1840
01:04:16,059 --> 01:04:20,829
about getting the answer I just only got

1841
01:04:19,179 --> 01:04:22,719
a chance to glance at it I only vaguely

1842
01:04:20,829 --> 01:04:24,009
know what it was about and then it

1843
01:04:22,719 --> 01:04:24,609
disappeared into an app I don't

1844
01:04:24,010 --> 01:04:26,170
understand

1845
01:04:24,610 --> 01:04:28,660
I got a similar message from somebody

1846
01:04:26,170 --> 01:04:30,460
asking me about Texas laws and I I don't

1847
01:04:28,659 --> 01:04:31,839
know anything about Texas law and I

1848
01:04:30,460 --> 01:04:33,099
thought I should research that but I

1849
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:36,760
didn't do it and now it's lost in my

1850
01:04:33,099 --> 01:04:39,730
Instagram messages access law sucks and

1851
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:41,170
then it just sucks kinda there you go

1852
01:04:39,730 --> 01:04:42,969
there you go listener who asked about

1853
01:04:41,170 --> 01:04:45,880
Texas that's what you get I guess no

1854
01:04:42,969 --> 01:04:47,589
Texas is one of the places that cops

1855
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:49,869
have been busted doing body cavity

1856
01:04:47,590 --> 01:04:52,059
searches on the side of the [ __ ] road

1857
01:04:49,869 --> 01:04:57,009
because the cop is pretty sure he smells

1858
01:04:52,059 --> 01:05:00,969
weed there also the place where if you

1859
01:04:57,010 --> 01:05:02,890
make edibles with a concentrate say like

1860
01:05:00,969 --> 01:05:05,079
you put a gram shatter into a tray of

1861
01:05:02,889 --> 01:05:07,150
brownies they put that whole tray of

1862
01:05:05,079 --> 01:05:09,940
brownies on the scale [ __ ] pyrex dish

1863
01:05:07,150 --> 01:05:11,800
included and say you've got 30 pounds of

1864
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:14,289
concentrate which they classify along

1865
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:16,140
the same lines as heroin and so because

1866
01:05:14,289 --> 01:05:19,119
you made hash brownies with actual hash

1867
01:05:16,139 --> 01:05:21,369
you get rung up like you had six kilos

1868
01:05:19,119 --> 01:05:22,329
of heroin come on over the border don't

1869
01:05:21,369 --> 01:05:24,400
mess with Texas

1870
01:05:22,329 --> 01:05:28,989
no seriously Texas is not the place to

1871
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:32,050
cannabis right now yeah their laws are

1872
01:05:28,989 --> 01:05:34,299
pretty brutal ah there are a lot of

1873
01:05:32,050 --> 01:05:36,900
cannabis refugees from Texas and

1874
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:39,730
Colorado yes there sure are yep

1875
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:41,230
alright Mike coughing from a dad but I

1876
01:05:39,730 --> 01:05:43,360
think it's time to wrap up this podcast

1877
01:05:41,230 --> 01:05:44,920
ladies and gentlemen see we didn't mean

1878
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:53,820
to do it but we say we throw a little

1879
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:56,590
informative nugget 250 episodes you guys

1880
01:05:53,820 --> 01:05:57,760
podcast thank you bro thank you when I

1881
01:05:56,590 --> 01:06:01,090
started I was like maybe I can do a

1882
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:03,010
hundred shows I'd done nearly in a

1883
01:06:01,090 --> 01:06:04,539
hundred episodes of another podcast with

1884
01:06:03,010 --> 01:06:06,130
a friend and I was like well that wasn't

1885
01:06:04,539 --> 01:06:07,420
that hard but he did all the talking I

1886
01:06:06,130 --> 01:06:09,579
was the producer and coast

1887
01:06:07,420 --> 01:06:11,889
I had to chime in and honestly I would

1888
01:06:09,579 --> 01:06:13,480
sit here and wait for him to say some

1889
01:06:11,889 --> 01:06:15,129
dumb [ __ ] so that I could just zing him

1890
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:18,250
the best I could was what I did on that

1891
01:06:15,130 --> 01:06:19,539
podcast but I had a lot of practice just

1892
01:06:18,250 --> 01:06:20,800
like I can do 100 episodes and I got to

1893
01:06:19,539 --> 01:06:21,829
100 I was like that doesn't even feel

1894
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:25,190
like I'm started it feels

1895
01:06:21,829 --> 01:06:27,019
I have a rhythm now on a set on episode

1896
01:06:25,190 --> 01:06:29,200
100 I don't remember if it was while we

1897
01:06:27,018 --> 01:06:31,639
were recording her right before or after

1898
01:06:29,199 --> 01:06:33,199
someone was like I can't believe you did

1899
01:06:31,639 --> 01:06:35,629
a hundred and you were like yeah we will

1900
01:06:33,199 --> 01:06:36,858
do this again for 200 and we all kind of

1901
01:06:35,630 --> 01:06:37,969
looked around the road looks like do you

1902
01:06:36,858 --> 01:06:40,909
really think I'm gonna do this in I

1903
01:06:37,969 --> 01:06:42,170
understand yeah yeah but there's that

1904
01:06:40,909 --> 01:06:43,518
kind of look and I was like man he's

1905
01:06:42,170 --> 01:06:47,150
really on a roll though some of these

1906
01:06:43,518 --> 01:06:48,949
shows are really good some of them I get

1907
01:06:47,150 --> 01:06:50,749
it somewhat were rambling and talking

1908
01:06:48,949 --> 01:06:52,129
but meant it's a lot of work to put out

1909
01:06:50,748 --> 01:06:53,598
this podcast sometimes we just got a

1910
