00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,280
some details there

169
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,800
so they are very successful they're a

170
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:10,159
cannabis consumer they've been smoking

171
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,400
since the 90s they're probably

172
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,199
close to my age and they are successful

173
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:15,599
so this

174
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,800
uh states first of all that people can

175
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,080
smoke cannabis and they can

176
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,639
self-medicate with it

177
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:21,918
and they can become very very successful

178
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,280
people and we shouldn't judge anybody

179
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:24,319
for the way they choose to medicate

180
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:27,758
themselves

181
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:29,918
i am rambling it says now um

182
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,840
chem dog was not only the guy to find

183
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:34,799
the seeds at that time

184
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:36,399
okay kemdog was not the only guy to find

185
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,720
seeds at that time with the grateful

186
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:39,519
dead and fish tours so it sounds like my

187
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,199
friend here

188
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:44,079
may have stumbled across some of those

189
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:46,800
chem dog seeds or those dog bud seeds

190
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:49,038
we found plenty and many northern

191
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,478
vermont and northern new york people

192
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:52,319
grew it too

193
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:54,800
yeah it's not unlikely if somebody found

194
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:56,560
if one person found 13 seeds in an ounce

195
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,160
um the weed was going around grateful

196
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,160
dead shows and fish shows there was more

197
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,400
of that herb going around

198
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,759
not just that one ounce had seeds in it

199
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:05,120
which is funny because the guys that

200
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,000
were selling it were hoping to find

201
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,918
seeds and they never

202
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,600
did to the best of my knowledge but it

203
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:11,279
sounds like they were in a couple of

204
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,800
eighths some of the custies got some of

205
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:15,038
those seeds

206
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,478
so people in vermont and new york were

207
00:06:15,038 --> 00:06:18,879
growing it too

208
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:21,439
big up to the new york and vermont fish

209
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:23,439
family i cannot wait to boogie down

210
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:25,918
in a couple of weeks if all things go

211
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:28,719
well uh now that i try different chem

212
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:31,439
dogs or chem 91 crosses i realize

213
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,680
how much a grower's style personality

214
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:35,439
and talent play a part yes that's

215
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,079
absolutely accurate

216
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:40,000
i always say that if i give 10 people a

217
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:41,199
clone of the same exact plant we're

218
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,560
going to get 10

219
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,079
different finished products they're

220
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,439
going to grow it differently their room

221
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:46,159
is differently the environment is

222
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:48,399
different

223
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,000
their nutrients are different ah they're

224
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:50,799
pruning their technique will be a little

225
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,800
bit different

226
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,478
then of course the dry and cure process

227
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,680
is going to be drastically different so

228
00:06:54,478 --> 00:06:58,478
we're going to get

229
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,160
some similar familiar aromas flavors the

230
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:01,598
buzz will be similar but there will be

231
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,840
subtle differences amongst

232
00:07:01,598 --> 00:07:05,360
every grow maybe some of the buds will

233
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:06,560
be more dense maybe some of the buds

234
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,199
will be fluffier

235
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,280
ah maybe some if the aromas lean certain

236
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,319
ways like with the chem 91 we get some

237
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:14,638
sweetness and some

238
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,000
foot and then some just weird funk maybe

239
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,199
some guys are going to bring out more

240
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,478
foot some guys are going to bring out

241
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,598
more funks some guys are going to bring

242
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:21,680
out the sweetness

243
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:23,279
that has a lot to do with the nutrients

244
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,120
the environment and then of course the

245
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:25,679
drying and curing process are going to

246
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,639
play

247
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,240
a huge role in the finished product so

248
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:33,120
it's a lot like a song

249
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,120
if uh if you get 10 bands that are all

250
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,439
professional bands and they play

251
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,720
the same song it's gonna sound a little

252
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:39,279
bit different they'll play the same

253
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,560
notes

254
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:42,478
but it's gonna have a little bit

255
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,079
different flavor to it i'm trying to

256
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:45,839
think of two bands we could compare that

257
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:46,959
are going to be anywhere near fair that

258
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:49,679
people may

259
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:50,478
i'm all right let's just say if we took

260
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,560
metallica

261
00:07:50,478 --> 00:07:54,639
and then we took a reggae band and we

262
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,280
did the wait you know take a load off

263
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,280
annie

264
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:58,799
right you're going to hear take a load

265
00:07:57,279 --> 00:07:59,758
off and it's going to be screaming with

266
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,598
metallica he's going to do

267
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,879
yeah and then in the reggae it's going

268
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:04,959
to be boom

269
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,240
take a load it's going to be real slow

270
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:08,000
it's the same song it's going to be the

271
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,519
same song played correctly

272
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,279
but done with different flavors and

273
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:11,839
different styles because it is very

274
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:13,439
artist

275
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:15,119
dependent i hope you followed along with

276
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:18,240
that we just compared

277
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,680
metallica and reggae to cannabis growing

278
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,879
on this podcast you never know what

279
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,959
we're going to do next

280
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,160
um so yes it does play a big part then

281
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:26,719
it goes on there is more

282
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,560
to this wonderful message it says since

283
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,240
what i'm looking for is not realistic i

284
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,240
was hoping you would have a strain in

285
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,278
your repertoire that might be inspired

286
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,320
by the mid

287
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:39,439
90s fish scene but with a rasta

288
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,959
jeff twist um

289
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,800
man you could probably find some of that

290
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,518
if you are from the vermont new york

291
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,879
area

292
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,560
somebody's probably got some of those

293
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:48,399
dog bud seeds that you were looking for

294
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:50,719
but you're looking for something

295
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,240
from the rasta jeff repertoire the irie

296
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,440
genetics catalog

297
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,639
that is chem 91 with a rosted jeff twist

298
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,160
you are in luck

299
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:59,439
my friend i have a couple of things i

300
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:01,439
would recommend for you the first one

301
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,320
i'm going to suggest will be the morning

302
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,000
do

303
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,080
morning dew is a cross of the grateful

304
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,159
dog to my arise

305
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,920
there's going to be a lot of chem in

306
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:12,958
there the grateful dog

307
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:14,000
is kim d2 or it's chem 91 i apologize

308
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:17,359
chem 91

309
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:20,639
to sfvog it is a deadhead

310
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:22,879
og uh kind of a feminized back crossed

311
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:24,559
inbreeding project i wasn't sure

312
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:26,240
what i was doing at the time when i made

313
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:27,199
that i didn't know i was doing something

314
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,039
strange

315
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,600
but i did get some grateful dead some

316
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:34,240
deadhead og seeds which is chem 91

317
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,040
and sf the san fernando valley og kush

318
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,480
f4

319
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:38,879
they were crossed to make the deadhead

320
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,159
og i did some feminizing and reversing

321
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:42,399
of that i crossed

322
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:44,159
uh phenotype the same phenotype i selfed

323
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,440
it then i took the

324
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:47,759
seed that came out of that and

325
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,600
pollinated that with the original

326
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:51,360
mom that i used so i kind of did some

327
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,959
inbreeding i pollinated one of the

328
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,399
offspring with the original mom to make

329
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:56,639
a super femme plant

330
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,440
um that is the grateful dog that has

331
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:01,039
been crossed

332
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:03,120
to the uh the arise which has

333
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:04,719
the chem d and the grandparents you're

334
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,039
going to see the chem d pop up a little

335
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,560
bit

336
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:09,039
you're going to see the chem 91 that

337
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:12,559
morning dew is very it's got the

338
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:13,039
that sour sweetness that chem 91 had i

339
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:14,639
know that

340
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:16,480
if you smoked it there's a sour

341
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:17,360
sweetness it's not the dominant flavor

342
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,879
but that's what

343
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,800
kind of gives it a little bit of a funk

344
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:21,838
to it that sour sweetness but it's also

345
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:23,759
got the fuel

346
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,880
and the cushy aromas that you expect

347
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:27,200
from a good chem

348
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:28,720
so i think the morning dew is probably

349
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:32,320
the closest you're gonna get

350
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,600
for a chem 91 with my sort of a twist on

351
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,640
it the next thing that i think you would

352
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,120
really enjoy

353
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:39,278
is a new cross that does not have a name

354
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,078
um it is in the works it will need a

355
00:10:39,278 --> 00:10:42,240
great name

356
00:10:40,078 --> 00:10:44,078
i'm not even sure that i want to reveal

357
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,480
the cross yet do we do it here on the

358
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:46,479
show

359
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,639
yeah we do it why not i am in the works

360
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,680
of crossing the p91

361
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:53,679
to the arise that will have some amazing

362
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:55,120
uh gassy funky smells it will smell a

363
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:56,719
lot like that old school stuff and it

364
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,360
should have a lot of that good buzz to

365
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,639
it

366
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,480
i haven't done it yet it's in the

367
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:03,039
process they're in the room together

368
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,120
it's almost time for the magic to happen

369
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:07,199
but the p91 to arise will be

370
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,720
something that will make you very happy

371
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,399
all right i think i answered that

372
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,480
question it was good uh

373
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:15,360
connecting with somebody who was very

374
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:17,839
has a very similar story to myself

375
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,399
uh very passionately curious i love

376
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,000
learning

377
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,480
i just wasn't interested in school

378
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,799
because they taught me all that i feel

379
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,399
like

380
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:26,240
everything i learned in school i learned

381
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,759
probably in like third or fourth grade

382
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,519
and then fifth and sixth grade was just

383
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:31,200
a repeat of that [ __ ] and then ninth and

384
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,879
tenth grades were repeats of all this

385
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,040
[ __ ] all over again and they just

386
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:36,000
repeated it and i didn't write what they

387
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:37,360
just kept teaching

388
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,360
the same dumb [ __ ] they didn't go much

389
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,159
further i felt like i learned much more

390
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,800
in life

391
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:44,639
uh and became successful as a cannabis

392
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:46,479
consumer after school yeah so

393
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:48,480
uh we have a lot in common we both love

394
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,278
that fish tour grateful dead stuff and

395
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,720
the chem

396
00:11:49,278 --> 00:11:53,200
i hope answered your question bro and i

397
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,839
do hope to see you uh at a fish show or

398
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,079
a

399
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:59,680
uh wherever we end up a dead and company

00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:16,480
of me another one that does reference

410
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:18,159
the chem dog and it says

411
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,360
rasta jeff i love it when they start

412
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:20,159
like that i was just listening to your

413
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,000
podcast

414
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:24,078
and you referenced the kim dog and the

415
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,919
13 beans yes i'm getting a lot of

416
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:26,479
responses because of that episode and i

417
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:28,719
love it

418
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,240
says man talk about some lineage that

419
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,120
shaped the east coast

420
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,079
cannabis scene yeah some of my favorite

421
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,000
strains come

422
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:37,759
from the chem 91 some of my favorite

423
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,078
stuff has chem 91 in it some of my

424
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:40,559
favorite

425
00:12:38,078 --> 00:12:41,359
crosses that i've made have chem and

426
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:43,278
other chem

427
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,200
lines in there so yeah it really shaped

428
00:12:43,278 --> 00:12:46,320
the east coast and i think it shaped all

429
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,000
of the cannabis scene to tell you the

430
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,278
truth bro not just on the east but yeah

431
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
it started there and

432
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:53,360
trickled out this way it says anyway i

433
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,039
went camping this year

434
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,959
i'm not sure if i should say exactly

435
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:58,958
yeah i went camping this year in bethel

436
00:12:56,958 --> 00:13:01,278
for a spartan race and took a trip over

437
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:03,359
to the woodstock museum i got lucky

438
00:13:01,278 --> 00:13:06,159
chatting with an old head who offered me

439
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,600
a quarter of his slightly stupid or

440
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:11,199
slightly seated

441
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:13,200
but stupid stony cookies and kim so this

442
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:16,639
herb was slightly seeded

443
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:18,079
and stupid stony cookies and kim so you

444
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:19,600
got some girl scout cookies

445
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:21,359
and then you got some chem in there it

446
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,800
could be kmd it could be chem dog it

447
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,600
could be a lot of things but cookies and

448
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:27,039
cam

449
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:29,600
um that's also known as the gmo

450
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:30,879
uh gmo is also known as chem cookies or

451
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,480
garlic cookies so you could have

452
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:35,278
something like that in there

453
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,720
that's a great cross but uh he says

454
00:13:35,278 --> 00:13:38,240
maybe it was just the scenery and the

455
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,079
atmosphere or whatever but i'm telling

456
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:43,198
you it was some of the best herb

457
00:13:40,078 --> 00:13:45,838
herb i have ever touched in my life

458
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:47,198
um it was the atmosphere the environment

459
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,959
the surprise of finding

460
00:13:47,198 --> 00:13:50,240
some new head at a really cool place

461
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:53,919
smoking you out

462
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:55,680
um and also it was like a change if you

463
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:57,360
i feel like if i smoke the same herb all

464
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:59,198
the time herb that i grew

465
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,639
uh herb from the same grovers around

466
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:02,078
here if i smoke the same concentrates

467
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,839
all the time the same jar

468
00:14:02,078 --> 00:14:05,120
i feel like the buzz gets boring i don't

469
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,040
get as

470
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,198
buzzed medicated i don't feel the effect

471
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:11,679
as much if i smoke uh

472
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:13,039
one gram of the same concentrate all day

473
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:14,559
by the end of the day i gotta switch

474
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:16,240
jars and smoke something different and

475
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:17,599
then i'll get a better buzz so part of

476
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,360
it was you switching up

477
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,879
uh your intake your medicine you ate at

478
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,360
a different restaurant so it just tasted

479
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:22,720
better

480
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,079
uh it's gonna be like that all the time

481
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,320
but i think that contributed it

482
00:14:24,078 --> 00:14:27,759
contributed

483
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:29,440
contributed did to it that's what i

484
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:31,360
meant to say i promise you

485
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,959
uh that really contributed to the the

486
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,360
experiences where you were

487
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:36,879
the new uh person but then of course

488
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,000
that new product was totally different

489
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:38,879
your body was like well these are

490
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,559
different terps and different

491
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:42,078
cannabinoids that i'm not familiar with

492
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:42,719
and different ratios this is kind of

493
00:14:42,078 --> 00:14:44,239
nice

494
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,920
and you were just out there loving life

495
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,120
feeling irie so it was a definitely a

496
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:50,159
good different buzz

497
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,759
now let's get to the fun part i found

498
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:53,679
eight seeds one of which

499
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:56,319
doesn't look viable but i kept it just

500
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:57,439
in case i got them stashed away for safe

501
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,320
keeping but man

502
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:02,320
i can't wait for the day i get that itch

503
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,000
to pop these seeds

504
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,839
so if you found eight of them and one

505
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,159
looks unviable you've got

506
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,279
seven seeds and i think they say seven

507
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:11,519
is a lucky number

508
00:15:09,278 --> 00:15:12,399
so you've got seven lucky seeds from

509
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:15,600
your friend

510
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:16,480
uh from the woodstock museum i cannot

511
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,959
believe

512
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,480
those seeds are not already germinated

513
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:22,239
if i had gotten those seeds from that

514
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,240
head in that situation i would

515
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,919
be they would be in dirt you'd already

516
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,560
be getting tests of what they grew like

517
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:29,360
from me

518
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:30,159
that's just how that would go um what a

519
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,399
great story

520
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:34,000
and i'm glad that the chem dog reference

521
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,440
and the kim dog story brought

522
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,679
that up and then i'm glad that that just

523
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:40,480
happened that uh some old head at the

524
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:43,838
woodstock museum of all places

525
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:45,920
had some slightly seeded but uh what did

526
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:48,480
the what's the word here stupid stoney

527
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:49,838
cookies and chem whatever you paid for

528
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,920
that bag of weed

529
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:53,920
unless what'd you get you got a quarter

530
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:56,000
uh you got eight seeds in there if you

531
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:57,519
paid around like 70 80 bucks

532
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,440
you definitely got a [ __ ] good deal

533
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,959
if you paid 50 bucks you got a magical

534
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,920
deal because those eight seeds in my

535
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:03,919
opinion

536
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:05,439
are worth probably 50 bucks i that that

537
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:06,639
would have been worth 50 bucks or so to

538
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,560
me anyway so

539
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:10,639
um yeah the weed was free the seeds are

540
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:11,518
what you definitely paid for so big come

541
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,839
up on that

542
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,360
uh this came from our friend poop grows

543
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:18,959
on patreon

544
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,278
um excellent name poop does grow no [ __ ]

545
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:22,000

546
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:22,879
uh bro grow those beans and send me

547

or or even better send me some beans bro

549
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:29,278

550
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,519
i'm excited to see what you've got

551
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:32,958
you've got some chem and cookies uh

552
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:35,120
who knows what pollinated that that

553
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:36,479
could be an s1 that could be

554
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,039
that could be anything it could be

555
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:41,759
magical you may have the next chem dog

556
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:42,399
in your jar that may be the next magical

557
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,680
strain

558
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:45,278
we've talked about where these strains

559
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:47,120
come from and then we discovered on a

560
00:16:45,278 --> 00:16:48,000
previous episode that even the sour d

561
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,679
allegedly

562
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,159
possibly was a mistake a bag seat if you

563
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:54,638
will

564
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:55,198
all right that is enough about the chem

565
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,959
stuff

566
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:59,120

607
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:08,079
an excellent model for us to base

608
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:11,359

619
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,519
from me which it makes me expect a lot

620
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,359
from me which makes you expect

621
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:35,519
it's just inspiring me every day so

622
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:36,558
thank you guys for the encouragement the

00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:38,720
motivation

624
00:18:36,558 --> 00:18:39,599
uh because without you guys on the other

625
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,038
end of this it would

626
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:42,558
i would just be a complete psychopath

627
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:43,599
i'd be a guy with too many cameras too

628
00:18:42,558 --> 00:18:45,038
many toys

629
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:46,959
and this would look [ __ ] weird so

630
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:49,200
thank you for all the support

631
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,880
it does go on it says i think that's a

632
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:54,240
huge compliment also thank you

633
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:56,160
um it says my question is when you breed

634
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,359
a male and female together you get

635
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,759
certain results

636
00:18:57,359 --> 00:19:01,678
uh yes then it says would the results be

637
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:02,240
completely different if you switched the

638
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,960
male

639
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:07,279
female order and bred those plants would

640
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:09,200
there be similarities also what if

641
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:10,399
we were using two females rather than a

642
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,480
male female

643
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,080
would there be different results and

644
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,000
then they break down some examples

645
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:18,319
i absolutely understand the question

646
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,679
here let's jump into answering this

647
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:21,759
all right just to make this question

648
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,559
nice and clear what this person is

649
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:24,480
asking

650
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:26,639
we want to do some breeding and we've

651
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,120
got plant a and plant b

652
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,679
to start the scenario plant a is the

653
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:31,678
male

654
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,798
and plant b is the female they want to

655
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,120
breed it that way

656
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:37,038
then they want to flip the male female

657
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:38,079
around to where the opposite plant is

658
00:19:37,038 --> 00:19:40,400
the male and the opposite

659
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:41,678
plant is the female i honestly don't

660
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,200
remember how i started

661
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:45,360
but the second round is the opposite of

662
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,880
whatever i said the first time

663
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:49,119
will there be a difference in the

664
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,679
outcome in the progeny of that breeding

665
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:52,319
project

666
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,919
if we flip them will we see differences

667
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:56,798
if we were to hypothetically

668
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:58,640
get i'm going to say uh og kush and

669
00:19:56,798 --> 00:20:00,720
golden goat if we used an og kush male

670
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,799
and a golden goat female and bred them

671
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,480
and then did an og kush female and a

672
00:20:02,798 --> 00:20:08,319
golden goat male and bred them

673
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:10,720
would we see differences depending on

674
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:11,918
your phenotypical selection for your

675
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:15,360
starting plants

676
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:18,880
most likely yes you will see differences

677
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:21,038
um the male in my opinion adds a lot to

678
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,559
the structure the shape of the plant the

679
00:20:21,038 --> 00:20:25,200
potency of the plant

680
00:20:22,558 --> 00:20:27,038
the mildew resistance the pathogen

681
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,519
resistance those sort of things i feel

682
00:20:27,038 --> 00:20:30,558
like come from the pollen donor side of

683
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:33,679
the plant

684
00:20:30,558 --> 00:20:34,079
so you may see and also it depends on

685
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:37,440
how

686
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:40,480
dominant each plant is in the mix

687
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,919
um so

688
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,919
let's just say they're even let's just

689
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:45,200
say we've got even dominance on

690
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:47,600
everything we've selected that they're

691
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:50,080
going to breed evenly that's really just

692
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:52,719
not common with anything in life but

693
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:55,439
um if we breed them so you're gonna see

694
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:58,480
uh you may see more of

695
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,038
the dad's tallness in each side you may

696
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,798
get the

697
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:02,720
the height of the dad in each of them

698
00:21:00,798 --> 00:21:04,558
you may get the pest resistance from the

699
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:07,360
dad in each of them so if you're

700
00:21:04,558 --> 00:21:09,599
oh gee so og kush og kush likes to get a

701
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:10,399
little bit drier golden goat gets really

702
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:13,359
thirsty

703
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:16,080
whichever dad you used i think you're

704
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:17,759
going to see that trait more dominant in

705
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:20,319
that cross if you use the golden goat

706
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:22,720
dad your offspring are going to be more

707
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:26,158
thirsty if you use the og kush dad

708
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,919
your offspring will be less thirsty

709
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:29,919
uh either way you do that cross so if

710
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,360
you if you use these two same plants

711
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:33,520
just flipping the dad

712
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:34,639
i think will have an effect on the

713
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:36,480
amount of thirst

714
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,640
in those plants and this is hypothetical

715
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,240
because i know that golden goat drinks

716
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,600
and eats like crazy and i know that the

717
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,279
og kush plants

718
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:45,678
uh they don't drink very much you can

719
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:47,359
almost starve them and not give them

720
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,480
water for a really long time they'll do

721
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:50,079
better you can't

722
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,839
you're more likely to kill an og kush

723
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:52,879
plant by over watering than under

724
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:53,839
watering so that's what i'm trying to

725
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,120
get with there

726
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:57,359
i hope that makes sense i'm going to

727
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:59,759
give another example

728
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:01,038
another good example is if we crossed

729
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:04,240
the grateful dog

730
00:22:01,038 --> 00:22:07,119
to the golden goat this has been done uh

731
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,319
one way it is called the golden road the

732
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:10,158
other way it is called

733
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:11,918
the heart of gold right now my brain's

734
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:13,120
playing tricks on me because i'm talking

735
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:14,480
and trying to talk about these two

736
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:15,359
strains and don't have notes on it in

737
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,000
front of me

738
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:19,199
but grateful dog and golden goat have

739
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,880
been crossed

740
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,640
each way to where the grateful dog has

741
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,720
been the pollen donor and the grateful

742
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:28,080
dog has been the pollen receiver

743
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:31,679
when the golden goat is the pollen donor

744
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:33,839
the progeny makes sweeter um

745
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:35,919
pointier buds they're sweeter in flavor

746
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:38,399
they've got more of that tropical flavor

747
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:40,320
and they're pointier that's uh they're

748
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,280
jagged the leaves are more serrated the

749
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:43,359
buds are

750
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:45,359
uh maybe a little bit fox taily but they

751
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:47,359
just look meaner the silhouette is just

752
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:48,319
more sharp and jagged that's why a lot

753
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:50,240
of phenotypes

754
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:52,000
i call it the mean girl phenotype of

755
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,839
stuff that i cross with golden goat

756
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,440
you can just see it in there now the

757
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:58,000
cross that the

758
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:00,558
grateful dog is the pollen donor those

759
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,279
come out with more of a rounded pinecone

760
00:23:00,558 --> 00:23:02,798
shaped bud

761
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:05,038
they aren't as jaggedy they don't have

762
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:06,240
as many uh maybe it's almost fox tailing

763
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:08,480
maybe it's fingery

764
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,079
but when i use the grateful dog as the

765
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,159
pollen donor it's tighter

766
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:14,240
it looks more like a tight silver pine

767
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:16,400
cone it gets this silver hue to it

768
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,558
a silver tent maybe a velvety sort of a

769
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,159
texture a little bit of purple to it

770
00:23:18,558 --> 00:23:22,480
so that's what happens when the grateful

771
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:23,760
dog is the pollen donor so yes you will

772
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,000
see differences

773
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:27,919
uh based on flipping the male and the

774
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,880
female you'll see differences

775
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:32,159
and it just depends on which male and

776
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,679
you're going to find some males that

777
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:35,360
when you breed with them they're really

778
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:36,000
dominant in the mix and you'll find some

779
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:37,519
males that just

780
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,880
mix really well with the female and

781
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:40,879
you'll find some that you're just making

782
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,480
reproductions of the females

783
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,240
so it's kind of about the dominance of

784
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,480
the male in your mix and that's really

785
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:49,599
going to have a huge effect on it but

786
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,000
you will see a difference in which way

787
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:51,439
you do

788
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,278
the cross so like i was saying with the

789
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,840
grateful dog to golden goat

790
00:23:53,278 --> 00:23:57,679
when the golden goat is the reversal

791
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:58,959
that flavor of the golden goat comes

792
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:00,880
through a little bit better

793
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,000
the flowering time of the golden goat

794
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,679
comes through but when i use the

795
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,440
grateful dog as the pollen donor the

796
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:07,200
flowering time of the grateful dog

797
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,720
the leaf shape and size of the grateful

798
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,880
dog seem to dominate

799
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,319
that mix so yes there absolutely is a

800
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,200
difference it does make a huge

801
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:15,519
difference

802
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,519
now the last part also what if you were

803
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:19,359
using two females rather than a male

804
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:20,798
female would there be different results

805
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:22,319
that's kind of what i was going with

806
00:24:20,798 --> 00:24:24,558
just now because i didn't even realize i

807
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:26,399
was talking about two feminized crosses

808
00:24:24,558 --> 00:24:27,839
but yes you will see the differences

809
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,278
there absolutely it's going to work just

810
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:32,079
like the boy girl

811
00:24:29,278 --> 00:24:32,558
maybe easier to see because you have

812
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:34,720
seen

813
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:36,319
the females in full flower as their

814
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,400
female butt expression so you can

815
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:40,798
identify the traits which are coming

816
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,240
from each side very accurately because

817
00:24:40,798 --> 00:24:43,599
you know what the females look like when

818
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,960
you're using the boy

819
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:46,158
you just know what the female looks like

820
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,600
and you're guessing the other traits

821
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:50,240
came from the boy's side

822
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:51,599
not uh traits from the history on the

823
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,960
mom's side

824
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:55,119
so i think i answer that i think it

825
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,880
makes sense they wrap it up with i hope

826
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:57,678
you understand the questions i totally

827
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,720
understand

828
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:02,960
i hope you understood my long and rambly

829
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,640
answer thank you for the great question

830
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,480
uh that came from my friend you can call

831
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,120
me brian big up to my friend you call me

832
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,400
brian

833
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:09,759
