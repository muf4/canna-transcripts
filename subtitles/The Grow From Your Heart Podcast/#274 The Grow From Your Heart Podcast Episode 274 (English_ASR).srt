30
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:20,368
talking about what I've been smoking on

31
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,660
and today I've got some [ __ ] worth

32
00:01:20,368 --> 00:01:23,909
talking about I have been dabbing on

33
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:25,379
some lemon Jeffrey's sauce and it is

34
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:26,670
tremendous let's talk a little bit about

35
00:01:25,379 --> 00:01:28,649
this I'm grabbing the package to tell

36
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:30,810
you about it I have got some lemon

37
00:01:28,649 --> 00:01:33,420
Jeffrey's sauce grown by our friends at

38
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:35,490
elevations in Colorado Springs extracted

39
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:37,409
by her friends at manna extracts a

40
00:01:35,489 --> 00:01:38,879
friend of mine on Instagram actually

41
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:40,469
contacted me and said hey dude you need

42
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:42,269
to have some of this so he made sure

43
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:43,560
that he got a few grams in my hands I

44
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:45,060
don't know if he wants to be mentioned

45
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,519
on the show or not he knows who he is

46
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:49,859
super huge shout out bro I appreciate it

47
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:51,750
also huge shout out to elevations and

48
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:54,118
manna extracts they did a hell of a good

49
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:56,099
job with this lemon Jeffrey sauce let's

50
00:01:54,118 --> 00:01:58,769
open up the jar and look at it for a

51
00:01:56,099 --> 00:02:00,390
second here the only problem is these

52
00:01:58,769 --> 00:02:02,219
jars kind of suck these charters get

53
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:03,329
stuck these childproof lids these suck

54
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:05,280
it's the only thing I would complain

55
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:07,289
about upgrade these [ __ ] jar lids but

56
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,689
I've got it open let's look at it the

57
00:02:07,289 --> 00:02:11,580
consistency is kind of like a moist cake

58
00:02:09,689 --> 00:02:13,848
batter or maybe a moist cheesecake

59
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:16,530
batter the color is beautiful it is

60
00:02:13,848 --> 00:02:18,359
beautifully golden yellow it is perfect

61
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:21,709
it's what you would think lemon candy

62
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:24,000
would be the color of and this jar is

63
00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:25,500
eight to ten inches away from my face

64
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,590
you guys and all I can smell is lemon

65
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:30,539
candy it just smells like lemon heads or

66
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:33,239
lemon meringue or some sort of really

67
00:02:30,539 --> 00:02:34,799
soft lemon scented candy and I really

68
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:36,480
enjoy it and I said softy I know that's

69
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,670
weird I think some things have like

70
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:40,649
lemon pledge has a hard lemon smell a

71
00:02:38,669 --> 00:02:41,939
lemon pledge that smell punches you in

72
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:44,370
the face and is pungent

73
00:02:41,939 --> 00:02:46,500
I think lemon Geoffrey has a soft lemon

74
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:47,819
smell it's got like a uh I don't know

75
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,199
it's not real abrasive it coats your

76
00:02:47,818 --> 00:02:51,598
tongue and it's pleasing it makes you go

77
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:52,019
ooh that's soft and yummy maybe I'm

78
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:54,269
crazy

79
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:55,590
but I think it's a soft lemon scent and

80
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:57,689
I really enjoy it so shows everybody

81
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:59,189
involved in there this hash is amazing

82
00:02:57,689 --> 00:03:00,270
I've talked about the consistency I

83
00:02:59,189 --> 00:03:00,989
talked about the color I talked about

84
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:03,540
the smell

85
00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:06,390
the taste is amazing I taste like you

86
00:03:03,539 --> 00:03:07,799
just put ah not the not the lemon head

87
00:03:06,389 --> 00:03:08,219
candy itself because those are a little

88
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,750
strong

89
00:03:08,219 --> 00:03:11,039
what this tastes like but the smell of

90
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,960
the lemon candy it's like you took a

91
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:15,090
bite out of that like how the lemon head

92
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,890
box smells when you smell it it smells

93
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:20,550
like you dabbed that flavor and it is

94
00:03:16,889 --> 00:03:22,859
delicious the hi obviously is tremendous

95
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:24,240
it's very sativa dominant and I think

96
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:26,190
it's got me rambling a little bit so

97
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,540
this should be a fun podcast once again

98
00:03:26,189 --> 00:03:29,609
shout out to everybody involved in this

99
00:03:27,539 --> 00:03:32,609
delicious lemon Jeffrey sauce of course

100
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:34,440
the lemon Jeffrey is the lemon skunk

101
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:35,970
pollinated by a reversed golden go of

102
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:38,129
course I made that strain several years

103
00:03:35,969 --> 00:03:41,340
ago it's making its way through Colorado

104
00:03:38,129 --> 00:03:42,810
again and getting very popular a lot of

105
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:46,080
people have been asking for more seeds

106
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:48,360
of the lemon Jeffrey and I think that in

107
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,310
2018 that will be one of my goals I

108
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:52,800
think I'm going to make no not I think I

109
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:55,080
am I am going to make more lemon Jeffery

110
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,610
seeds in 2018 so everybody that's been

111
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,350
asking there's the official announcement

112
00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:00,000
I talked about it on an Instagram live

113
00:03:58,349 --> 00:04:01,379
video the other day but this is the

114
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,020
official announcement I will be making

115
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:06,060
more lemon Jeffrey feminized seeds in

116
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:07,590
2018 it may not be till the summer

117
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:09,390
because I've got other things lined up

118
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:11,759
and I've got schedules and [ __ ] like

119
00:04:09,389 --> 00:04:13,679
that to go with but there will be more

120
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:15,780
lemon Jeffery seeds in the future

121
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,879
and speaking of seeds in the future

122
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:19,108
let's talk about my breeding project I

123
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:21,509
like to keep you guys updated on a

124
00:04:19,108 --> 00:04:23,069
breeding project I'm working on I keep

125
00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:25,500
telling you guys that I've got a star

126
00:04:23,069 --> 00:04:27,449
dog and a Durbin poison in the breeding

127
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,728
room that will get pollinated by a rise

128
00:04:27,449 --> 00:04:31,649
there's also a platinum tangi in there

129
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:33,180
there's ecto cooler in there there are

130
00:04:31,649 --> 00:04:35,310
several great females in there that are

131
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:37,110
gonna get pollinated or actually at this

132
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:39,600
point in time have been pollinated by

133
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:41,069
King Solomon they look great the pistols

134
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,200
have curled up I can see the seeds

135
00:04:41,069 --> 00:04:45,779
developing they're starting to get thick

136
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:47,189
already there's about 30 days to go in

137
00:04:45,779 --> 00:04:49,079
that grow before those seeds will be

138
00:04:47,189 --> 00:04:51,180
ready but I can see that the pollination

139
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:52,649
went well I can see that the seeds are

140
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:54,569
developing I can see that the plants are

141
00:04:52,649 --> 00:04:57,120
healthy and I can see that this is going

142
00:04:54,569 --> 00:05:00,360
to be a successful pollen chucking run

143
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:02,668
so here in about 30 days from now I will

144
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,770
have new stuff that needs to be tested I

145
00:05:02,668 --> 00:05:06,750
will have replenishing --zz of old stuff

146
00:05:04,769 --> 00:05:08,609
so that the hella dank seed bank can get

147
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:11,009
some restocks they'll also get some of

148
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:12,330
the new stuff so stay tuned new stuff is

149
00:05:11,009 --> 00:05:14,909
coming you guys I am really excited

150
00:05:12,329 --> 00:05:17,609
about this star dog cross to arise and

151
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:18,840
I'm really excited about Durbin poison

152
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:20,280
cross to arise I think that those are

153
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:21,959
gonna have great potential those are two

154
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:23,489
of my favorite strains so

155
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:25,469
them to the arize has me really excited

156
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:26,970
and I kind of can't wait so I'll keep

157

00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:30,720
about it on every episode from now until

159
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:32,069
the time they come down and then I'll

160
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,199
start talking about them again when I

161
00:05:32,069 --> 00:05:35,550
grow them cuz I really can't wait so get

162
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:38,400

cuz I'll talk about them a lot I'm also

164

165
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:44,669
cross to arise just something about that

166
00:05:42,629 --> 00:05:46,439
that orange smell when I walk in the

167
00:05:44,668 --> 00:05:48,418
garden I can smell that platinum tangi

168
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:50,219
uh over everything else it's the

169
00:05:48,418 --> 00:05:51,899
platinum tangi and the cactus cooler the

170
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:53,009
aromas of those things just overpower

171
00:05:51,899 --> 00:05:55,709
everything

172
00:05:53,009 --> 00:05:57,990
also there's a leroy in there that's

173
00:05:55,709 --> 00:06:00,149
gonna get pollinated and I'm making a

174
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:02,728
strain for a friend and the leroy to

175
00:06:00,149 --> 00:06:04,168
arise will be called the Cletus and

176
00:06:02,728 --> 00:06:06,359
that's being made for a friend so I

177
00:06:04,168 --> 00:06:08,370
don't have any plans to release the

178
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,020
seeds of the Cletus it's not gonna go

179
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:11,728
anywhere it'll be in my garden it'll be

180
00:06:10,019 --> 00:06:13,560
in my friend cletus's garden it may be

181
00:06:11,728 --> 00:06:15,418
in a couple other small gardens but I'm

182
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,639
really I'm not gonna make a lot of seeds

183
00:06:15,418 --> 00:06:19,829
I expect maybe 20 to 50 seeds out of the

184
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:20,910
small plant that I made but the Cletus

185
00:06:19,829 --> 00:06:22,500
will be coming and it's something I'm

186
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:25,349
excited about because it's a breeding

187
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:26,639
project for a friend who moved away he's

188
00:06:25,348 --> 00:06:28,680
not around here anymore we don't get to

189
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,900
hang out but we still talk I think it'll

190
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:33,000
be fun to grow the Cletus for my friend

191
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:34,769
Cletus shoutout Cletus I hope you hear

192
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,629
this brother oh and since we're talking

193
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:39,000
about naming strains and new cannabis

194
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:41,189
strains the Zack Hayes cross to arise

195
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,918
has an official name it is now

196
00:06:41,189 --> 00:06:45,209
officially called pure love the reason

197
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:46,379
it's called pure love is because I was

198
00:06:45,209 --> 00:06:47,339
trying to come up with the name of it I

199
00:06:46,379 --> 00:06:49,800
was sitting there thinking about my

200
00:06:47,339 --> 00:06:51,359
buddy Zach but if you don't know Zack

201
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,038
Hayes is a cross that was made for my

202
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,740
friend Zach from New Mexico who passed

203
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:58,680
away from cystic fibrosis his real name

204
00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:00,930
was Zack Hayes some friends of ours made

205
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:03,120
a strain for him called Zack Hayes I was

206
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:04,918
gifted a Zack Hayes clone I did what I'm

207
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:08,098
supposed to do and I pollinated that

208
00:07:04,918 --> 00:07:10,288
Zack Hayes clone with the arise and then

209
00:07:08,098 --> 00:07:11,550
took those seeds and I gave them back to

210
00:07:10,288 --> 00:07:13,889
our friends of our cantika

211
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:16,288
they got almost half of all the seeds of

212
00:07:13,889 --> 00:07:17,699
his a Ches to arise I produced I was

213
00:07:16,288 --> 00:07:19,469
sitting there thinking of a name for it

214
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:20,819
I was looking at Zacks Facebook page

215
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:22,710
because it's still up I was looking at

216
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:24,598
Zacks Instagram I was trying to find a

217
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:27,239
way to name this strain and honor Zack

218
00:07:24,598 --> 00:07:28,949
and I was like when I'm trying to name a

219
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:31,139
strain I think why did you do this and

220
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:32,968
in my head I said I did it out of pure

221
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:35,158
love and I said well [ __ ] that's the

222
00:07:32,968 --> 00:07:35,728
name of the strain pure love Zack Hayes

223
00:07:35,158 --> 00:07:38,459
2a

224
00:07:35,728 --> 00:07:40,288
is called pure love I do not know if I

225
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:42,269
will release the pure love strain in

226
00:07:40,288 --> 00:07:44,218
seed form to the public because it has

227
00:07:42,269 --> 00:07:46,049
not been tested yet org antica has got

228
00:07:44,218 --> 00:07:47,879
the first batch of seeds they get to

229
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:50,579
grow it first they're gonna test it for

230
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:51,689
me if they like it if it shows that

231
00:07:50,579 --> 00:07:53,338
there are no herbes that there are no

232
00:07:51,689 --> 00:07:54,930
problems that it's a quality strain that

233
00:07:53,338 --> 00:07:56,009
it puts out good THC that it's worth

234
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:58,139
growing and it's worth sharing with

235
00:07:56,009 --> 00:08:00,180
people I will consider putting it out as

236
00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:02,249
a public release for other people to

237
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:04,110
grow but until org antica finds their

238
00:08:02,249 --> 00:08:05,338
clone until organic against done with it

239
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:07,110
it's not going anywhere

240
00:08:05,338 --> 00:08:08,309
myself and organic are you gonna keep it

241
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:10,588
private because that was something made

242
00:08:08,309 --> 00:08:11,879
for a friend and then it was made even

243
00:08:10,588 --> 00:08:13,079
further for a friend it's kind of a

244
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:15,210
personal project we're gonna keep it

245
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:18,180
closed until it's until we've had our

246
00:08:15,209 --> 00:08:19,709
run with it but pure love Zack Hayes to

267
00:08:51,299 --> 00:08:54,929
alright let's move forward with the

268
00:08:52,769 --> 00:08:56,850
podcast a little bit it is the first of

269
00:08:54,929 --> 00:08:59,458
the year so I thought it would be a good

270
00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:01,199
idea to talk about some attainable

271
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:03,899
garden goals and ways that you can

272
00:09:01,198 --> 00:09:05,370
improve your garden in 2018 if you're

273
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:07,440
not thinking of ways to improve your

274
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:08,789
standing still and moving backwards so

275
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,029
let's talk about ways that we can

276
00:09:08,789 --> 00:09:13,919
improve our garden in 2018 and realistic

277
00:09:12,028 --> 00:09:15,568
goals that you can set for yourself that

278
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:18,269
you would actually be able to reach for

279
00:09:15,568 --> 00:09:20,309
your garden in 2018 a lot of people may

280
00:09:18,269 --> 00:09:22,169
say hey I want to grow better I want to

281
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:23,909
do something better next year with my

282
00:09:22,169 --> 00:09:26,429
garden with my life with myself but they

283
00:09:23,909 --> 00:09:27,448
don't know what they want to do so I've

284
00:09:26,429 --> 00:09:29,519
thought of some goals that you can

285
00:09:27,448 --> 00:09:31,740
actually reach some goals that are

286
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,929
attainable these are goals that any

287
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:35,579
grower can reach for because if you're

288
00:09:33,929 --> 00:09:37,439
an excellent grower if you're a mediocre

289
00:09:35,578 --> 00:09:38,849
grower if you're a shitty grower if

290
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,440
you're an old-school grower if you're a

291
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:41,790
pro grower there's always room for

292
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:44,130
improvement and the things I'm gonna

293
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:47,610
mention everybody can improve on a

294
00:09:44,129 --> 00:09:48,720
little bit so let's talk about goals you

295
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:51,778
can reach to

296
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,519
prove your garden in 2018 the first

297
00:09:51,778 --> 00:09:55,049
thing you can do and it kind of sounds

298
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,028
redundant cuz I've already said this the

299
00:09:55,049 --> 00:09:59,729
first thing you can do is set some goals

300
00:09:57,028 --> 00:10:01,828
get out some paper get out of dry erase

301
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:03,870
board get out your phone open up a

302
00:10:01,828 --> 00:10:06,989
notepad and actually write something

303
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:08,730
down it will actually be a goal for 2018

304
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:12,839
if you don't write it down if you just

305
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:14,909
say in 2018 I want to do this sure you

306
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:16,529
said it it's out there there were no

307
00:10:14,909 --> 00:10:17,669
witnesses there's nothing holding you to

308
00:10:16,528 --> 00:10:19,559
it there's nothing to remind you that

309
00:10:17,669 --> 00:10:21,028
every day if you've got a piece of paper

310
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:22,979
sitting on your desk if you've got a

311
00:10:21,028 --> 00:10:24,179
note on the refrigerator if you've got a

312
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:26,459
note in your phone and you see it

313
00:10:24,179 --> 00:10:28,289
occasionally and it says in 2018 I'm

314
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:30,208
going to improve this it's a reminder

315
00:10:28,289 --> 00:10:33,028
there's some accountability there you

316
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:34,588
see it and if you stop doing it you kind

317
00:10:33,028 --> 00:10:35,759
of feel shitty for yourself and bad

318
00:10:34,589 --> 00:10:36,509
about yourself because you have failed

319
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:38,818
yourself

320
00:10:36,509 --> 00:10:41,068
so write it down put it on paper just

321
00:10:38,818 --> 00:10:42,958
say hey I'm going to do this even if

322
00:10:41,068 --> 00:10:45,328
it's just a little thing and a small

323
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:47,068
improvement a small goal write it down

324
00:10:45,328 --> 00:10:48,688
and accomplish it we talked I think I

325
00:10:47,068 --> 00:10:50,698
talked about this on the last episode if

326
00:10:48,688 --> 00:10:52,078
you write down a goal you'll accomplish

327
00:10:50,698 --> 00:10:53,490
it and then when you accomplish that

328
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:55,109
goal you'll say oh [ __ ] I got to write

329
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:56,610
down another goal and then you'll write

330
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:57,870
down two goals and then you'll

331
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:59,699
accomplish both of those and you'll go

332
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:01,259
should I can do a lot of things and your

333
00:10:59,698 --> 00:11:03,299
goals will get bigger your life will get

334
00:11:01,259 --> 00:11:04,680
better and you'll start improving in so

335
00:11:03,299 --> 00:11:06,120
many different ways you'll gain more

336
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:07,708
confidence you'll get a better

337
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,970
personality you'll get a better life

338
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:10,679
things will just start coming together

339
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:12,600
so write down a goal that's all you have

340
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:14,969
to do one goal accomplished that one

341
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,290
goal that'll turn into two goals that'll

342
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:19,620
turn into you just crush and [ __ ]

343
00:11:16,289 --> 00:11:21,208
life so write down a goal this podcast

344
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:24,000
is about cannabis so we're gonna write

345
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:25,469
down a cannabis related goal here's

346
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,778
something I think we should all be

347
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:30,028
striving for we all want better yield

348
00:11:27,778 --> 00:11:32,730
right you want to pull more weight you

349
00:11:30,028 --> 00:11:35,759
want more grams per watt whatever grow

350
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:37,740
room you've been growing in however much

351
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:39,750
you've been pulling consistently let's

352
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:42,659
strive for a little bit more let's

353
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:45,299
strive for a better yield in 2018 that's

354
00:11:42,659 --> 00:11:47,250
an attainable goal the only way to reach

355
00:11:45,299 --> 00:11:49,258
that goal is to find ways to improve

356
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:51,089
your garden now what are a few ways that

357
00:11:49,259 --> 00:11:54,360
you can improve your garden to reach

358
00:11:51,089 --> 00:11:57,329
your better yield goal things like scrog

359
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:58,829
doing any scrog Anor any canopy control

360
00:11:57,328 --> 00:12:00,448
you need to get some canopy control

361
00:11:58,828 --> 00:12:02,338
going on in the garden a scrog is real

362
00:12:00,448 --> 00:12:04,620
easy I've done a full Episode on

363
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:06,540
Draghi Scroggins when he put a net up

364
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:08,188
above the canopy and you bend all the

365
00:12:06,539 --> 00:12:09,838
plants down into that net so they can't

366
00:12:08,188 --> 00:12:11,698
grow too high but they're growing out

367
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:13,230
now now you were filling your horizontal

368
00:12:11,698 --> 00:12:14,549
space instead of the vertical space

369
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:16,259
you're not growing up into the lights

370
00:12:14,549 --> 00:12:18,058
but you're spreading the plant and

371
00:12:16,259 --> 00:12:20,159
you're using up all the space so scrog

372
00:12:18,058 --> 00:12:22,708
will be a great way to increase your

373
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:24,719
yield popping and twisting and super

374
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:26,628
cropping the plants would be a wonderful

375
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,829
way to help you increase your yields

376
00:12:26,629 --> 00:12:31,550
when the plants are in veg and they're

377
00:12:28,828 --> 00:12:33,719
getting big walk over and pop the stems

378
00:12:31,549 --> 00:12:37,169
let me kind of explain this a little bit

379
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:39,089
different I start about two inches above

380
00:12:37,169 --> 00:12:40,378
where the pot cut or the stem comes out

381
00:12:39,089 --> 00:12:42,029
of the dirt so you got some dirt with a

382
00:12:40,379 --> 00:12:43,829
little stick sticking out I just put my

383
00:12:42,028 --> 00:12:45,539
finger there and grab the base of that

384
00:12:43,828 --> 00:12:47,729
stock then I reach up about an inch

385
00:12:45,539 --> 00:12:49,139
above that and I just twist my fingers

386
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:51,720
opposite directions and it sounds like

387
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:53,249
this it sounds just like you popped your

388
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,660
knuckle that's what I just did and the

389
00:12:53,249 --> 00:12:56,129
plant goes pop and you're just breaking

390
00:12:54,659 --> 00:12:58,588
the cellulose right there on the plant

391
00:12:56,129 --> 00:13:00,420
can I move up about four inches and do

392
00:12:58,589 --> 00:13:02,189
it again and move up four inches and do

393
00:13:00,419 --> 00:13:03,719
it again and then I repeat this on all

394
00:13:02,188 --> 00:13:05,969
of the larger branches of the plant

395
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:07,649
you'll start to see knuckles form on all

396
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:09,839
the spots where you've done this you are

397
00:13:07,649 --> 00:13:11,068
now allowing more nutrient to pass

398
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,679
through the plant you are now making

399
00:13:11,068 --> 00:13:16,259
that stalk thicker and stronger you're

400
00:13:13,678 --> 00:13:18,240
making bigger more robust more active

401
00:13:16,259 --> 00:13:19,860
more productive plants so get in there

402
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,688
and pop them just pop them just give

403
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:23,839
them up a little just a little pop just

404
00:13:21,688 --> 00:13:26,490
twist it try it on a couple branches

405
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:28,050
maybe if it's your first try don't do it

406
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:29,249
at the base maybe you go to the top of

407
00:13:28,049 --> 00:13:30,208
the plant and give it a twist and see

408
00:13:29,249 --> 00:13:31,800
what happens when you give it just a

409
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:34,438
little turn it'll go pop you're gonna

410
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:36,419
hear a crunch perfect don't bend it over

411
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:37,980
don't break it just a little popping a

412
00:13:36,419 --> 00:13:39,659
little bit of a twist right there that's

413
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:42,269
gonna help that plant become stronger

414
00:13:39,659 --> 00:13:44,129
healthier it's gonna be more active it's

415
00:13:42,269 --> 00:13:47,519
gonna work out a little stronger so that

416
00:13:44,129 --> 00:13:49,259
will help you also defoliation oh and

417
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:51,209
also the popping and twisting I do that

418
00:13:49,259 --> 00:13:52,678
I start when the plants get kind of big

419
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:54,599
and veg and I will do that all the way

420
00:13:52,678 --> 00:13:56,909
up to like week three for maybe week

421
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,319
five of some plants it depends on the

422
00:13:56,909 --> 00:14:01,110
strain and depends on how robust they

423
00:13:58,318 --> 00:14:02,818
aren't how they're growing but week four

424
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:04,829
into flower is not odd to see me walk up

425
00:14:02,818 --> 00:14:06,628
and just pop a branch pop and you'll

426
00:14:04,828 --> 00:14:09,479
watch it recover within a day and start

427
00:14:06,629 --> 00:14:11,579
growing even faster so you can scrub you

428
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:14,610
can pop and twist and then you can de

429
00:14:11,578 --> 00:14:15,879
foliate get in there and remove leaves

430
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:17,169
that are not necessary

431
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:19,149
that are in the way of light getting

432
00:14:17,169 --> 00:14:20,169
into your canopy take those leaves out

433
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:22,000
of there you're not trying to grow

434
00:14:20,169 --> 00:14:23,110
leaves you're trying to grow buds so

435
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,210
leaves that are too big

436
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:27,009
go ahead and take them off if you're not

437
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:28,180
sure how much defoliating you want to do

438
00:14:27,009 --> 00:14:30,279
and you're kind of new at it and you're

439
00:14:28,179 --> 00:14:31,959
a little bit afraid that first day of

440
00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:34,089
flowering go in there and take off any

441
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:35,650
leaf that's got a purple stem if you got

442
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:37,660
a big leaf with the purple stem just

443
00:14:35,649 --> 00:14:39,279
take it off if the plants are healthy

444
00:14:37,659 --> 00:14:40,600
that purple stem will probably just snap

445
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,949
right off you don't need scissors or

446
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:44,170
anything just grab it and pop it right

447
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:45,940
off in there if you feel like you're

448
00:14:44,169 --> 00:14:48,099
afraid to take too much off just go

449
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:50,110
lightly you can always go harder so on

450
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:52,210
week one I like to strip the plants on

451
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:53,680
week two I like to go in and kind of

452
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:55,240
bottom them take out that [ __ ] on the

453
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:57,519
bottom lollipop a little bit that's

454
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:59,440
another way to improve your yield

455
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:01,299
lollipop take off all the [ __ ] on the

456
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,530
bottom so you'll have big branches that

457
00:15:01,299 --> 00:15:03,639
come up if they don't come up high

458
00:15:02,529 --> 00:15:05,799
enough to where you think they're gonna

459
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:07,480
make bud and reach the light get rid of

460
00:15:05,799 --> 00:15:09,490
up rid of them if you've got branches

461
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:11,289
that do come up to the light but there's

462
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:12,909
a bunch of [ __ ] on the bottom like

463
00:15:11,289 --> 00:15:15,039
little tiny sucker branches coming off

464
00:15:12,909 --> 00:15:17,319
you can clean those all the way off it's

465
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:19,329
not rare for me to have if I've got a

466
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:21,580
four foot tall plant I'll clean up the

467
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:23,830
whole foot off the bottom there will be

468
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:25,570
just a stalk for the whole 12 inches at

469
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:27,160
the bottom no branches coming off then

470
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:29,020
those first branches that come off it

471
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:32,019
would not be rare for them to have two

472
00:15:29,019 --> 00:15:34,210
feet of nothing and nothing a nobody for

473
00:15:32,019 --> 00:15:36,220
the last lake foot to ten inches maybe

474
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:37,480
eight inches there's no bud there I just

475
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:38,980
cleaned it all off because all that

476
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,600
bottom shit's not gonna grow it's not

477
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:42,340
getting light it's not getting any

478
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,870
energy it's just gonna be crappy stuff

479
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:45,129
that you don't want to trim and if you

480
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:46,870
clean it off the bottom you can move

481
00:15:45,129 --> 00:15:48,580
that energy up to the top buds and get

482
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:50,019
the energy up to the top or the shits

483
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:53,050
easier to trim and you get more

484
00:15:50,019 --> 00:15:54,850
production so week one do some stripping

485
00:15:53,049 --> 00:15:56,889
week to get in there in lollipop week

486
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:58,990
three do more stripping take more leaves

487
00:15:56,889 --> 00:16:00,159
out clean it up make more space spread

488
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:02,200
them out a little bit so the light can

489
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:03,579
get in there and then on week four do

490
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,900
your final bottoming get in there and

491
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:06,670
clean out the bottoms take off all those

492
00:16:04,899 --> 00:16:08,829
little sucker branches all those little

493
00:16:06,669 --> 00:16:11,829
shitty popcorn buds get those out of

494
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:13,360
there so it's leaf bottom leaf final

495
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:15,850
bottom and then you can keep me foliated

496
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:17,740
the flower cycle if you wish to that's

497
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:19,600
up to you if you go too hard on

498
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:20,950
defoliation you can kind of slow down

499
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,990
the growth you'll slow down bud

500
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:24,700
production if you go too hard so you'll

501
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:27,549
have to find a happy medium it's very

502
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:29,740
strange specific but if you week one

503
00:16:27,549 --> 00:16:31,419
strip week two lollipop

504
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:32,799
week three strip a little bit more than

505
00:16:31,419 --> 00:16:34,719
week four ago cleanup the final at the

506
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:38,439
bottoms for the final part that will

507
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:40,000
really help you increase your yields all

508
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,680
right so everybody wants bigger yields

509
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,269
the next thing everybody wants to do and

510
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:44,469
a goal that you can set you for yourself

511
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:46,029
and a goal that would definitely be

512
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:49,720
attainable if you work at it is

513
00:16:46,029 --> 00:16:52,360
increasing the potency of your finished

514
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:54,910
product now how can we do that

515
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:56,529
potency is kind of limited by genetics

516
00:16:54,909 --> 00:16:59,139
if you've got genetics that do not put

517
00:16:56,529 --> 00:17:01,480
out high THC then you may not be able to

518
00:16:59,139 --> 00:17:02,710
increase that THC much more than what it

519
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,720
already is you may be reaching its

520
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:06,759
potential but if you've got some plants

521
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,289
that you know can get better if one of

522
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:10,000
your friends has the same clone or if

523
00:17:08,289 --> 00:17:11,349
you've grown it better before there are

524
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,319
a few things that you can do to dial

525
00:17:11,349 --> 00:17:16,449
that in consistency is the key if that

526
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:18,789
plant has the potential of getting 32

527
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:22,120
percent THC and you're only getting 28 a

528
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:24,549
few things you can do are dial in the

529
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:26,309
temperature and humidity plants like

530
00:17:24,549 --> 00:17:28,419
consistency plants like reliability

531
00:17:26,309 --> 00:17:29,950
maybe your plant likes it a little

532
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:31,660
hotter maybe your plant likes it a

533
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:34,029
little cooler you're gonna have to dial

534
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:36,580
in the temps and the humidity and it's

535
00:17:34,029 --> 00:17:38,649
going to be plant specific growing

536
00:17:36,579 --> 00:17:41,289
cannabis is like having a girlfriend you

537
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:44,170
need to figure out how to cater to that

538
00:17:41,289 --> 00:17:46,539
plant to keep it happy you can't have

539
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:48,340
three girlfriends because you can't keep

540
00:17:46,539 --> 00:17:50,230
all three of them happy one's gonna want

541
00:17:48,339 --> 00:17:51,429
to eat at the Spaghetti Factory one's

542
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:53,349
gonna want to eat at the Cheesecake

543
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:54,850
Factory and one's not gonna [ __ ] have

544
00:17:53,349 --> 00:17:55,779
any idea what she wants and she's gonna

545
00:17:54,849 --> 00:17:57,609
leave it up to you

546
00:17:55,779 --> 00:17:59,589
cannabis plants are the same [ __ ] way

547
00:17:57,609 --> 00:18:01,449
it's hard to have multiple cannabis

548
00:17:59,589 --> 00:18:03,789
plants in the same room and dial them

549
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:06,279
all in perfectly so if you want to

550
00:18:03,789 --> 00:18:08,379
improve your potency select a strain and

551
00:18:06,279 --> 00:18:10,329
work with it and figure out what

552
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:11,950
temperature it likes figure out what

553
00:18:10,329 --> 00:18:14,470
humidity it likes you'll be able to tell

554
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:16,779
by looking most of the time you're gonna

555
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:18,160
have to run a strain several times to

556
00:18:16,779 --> 00:18:20,379
dial it in perfectly

557
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:22,900
so get your temps dialed in get your

558
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:25,030
humidity dial then get your feed dialed

559
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:27,190
in for that specific plant as that plant

560
00:18:25,029 --> 00:18:28,990
want more nutrients does that plant want

561
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:31,390
less nutrients a lot of people forget

562
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:33,250
that some of the cushions and og plants

563
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:35,050
they want a little more cal-mag people

564
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:36,819
forget that some of the plants may want

565
00:18:35,049 --> 00:18:38,769
a little more amino acids they don't pay

566
00:18:36,819 --> 00:18:41,980
attention to stuff like that so for

567
00:18:38,769 --> 00:18:43,519
better potency dial in your crop start

568
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:46,610
paying attention to timpz and

569
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:49,099
be more consistent get your ph on point

570
00:18:46,609 --> 00:18:50,629
it's your feeds on point I wish I could

571
00:18:49,099 --> 00:18:52,279
tell you that the planet wants this

572
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:54,230
temperature and this humidity and this

573
00:18:52,279 --> 00:18:57,259
much feed but when you're trying to

574
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:59,450
improve that this level it's going to be

575
00:18:57,259 --> 00:19:02,629
plant specific yes ideally somewhere

576
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:04,640
between like 75 and 78 degrees would be

577
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:06,920
really nice but maybe your plant is from

578
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,900
another region maybe your plant is a

579
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:10,519
specific phenotype that wants it really

580
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:12,620
hot and likes it or maybe it likes it

581
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:14,599
really cold you're gonna have to dial in

582
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:16,759
your plant which is going to take

583
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:18,439
attention and a relationship you're

584
00:19:16,759 --> 00:19:20,329
gonna have to build a relationship with

585
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:21,740
this plant so that you know what it

586
00:19:20,329 --> 00:19:24,349
likes you have to be in there every day

587
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:27,650
looking at it take notes write [ __ ] down

588
00:19:24,349 --> 00:19:30,678
you're trying to get this plant perfect

589
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:32,809
I run a very large commercial grow we

590
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:34,910
have got approximately 40 different

591
00:19:32,808 --> 00:19:36,889
strains in there I have got notes on a

592
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:39,320
board for all the growth staff just to

593
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:41,780
remind them hey the blueberry cookies

594
00:19:39,319 --> 00:19:43,879
does not like being over watered do not

595
00:19:41,779 --> 00:19:45,710
over water blueberry cookies there's

596
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:47,720
another one that gets really pissed off

597
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:49,460
if you do foliate it too hard there's

598
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,720
another one that we have to not pack

599
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:52,429
them too close together because they

600
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,019
don't do [ __ ] together when you press

601
00:19:52,429 --> 00:19:55,640
them too close together it's learning

602
00:19:54,019 --> 00:19:57,259
each plant it's learning your plant and

603
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:59,210
dialing it in so if you want to increase

604
00:19:57,259 --> 00:20:01,039
your potency you're gonna have to learn

605
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:02,960
that plant you're gonna have to get your

606
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:04,759
room perfect you're gonna have to get

607
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,470
everything dialed in you're gonna have

608
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:08,179
to grow that plant a couple of cycles

609
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:10,910
and figure out what it doesn't does not

610
00:20:08,179 --> 00:20:13,970
like so that's a reachable goal better

611
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:16,279
potency is an attainable goal for 2018

612
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:17,690
now a lot of you don't live in legal

613
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:19,160
states a lot of you that are growing may

614
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:21,259
live somewhere you don't have access to

615
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:23,330
testing so this may not be a goal that

616
00:20:21,259 --> 00:20:25,279
you can verify but you'll be able to

617
00:20:23,329 --> 00:20:27,139
tell you will be able to see the extra

618
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:29,359
work you put in you'll be able to tell

619
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:30,950
the extra details that you worked on

620
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:32,959
you'll be able to see it in the finished

621
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:35,120
product and I bet you won't even need a

622
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,740
lab to show that you are getting better

623
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:38,509
potency

624
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:40,400
all right we covered the two obvious

625
00:20:38,509 --> 00:20:41,960
things that people want to improve and

626
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,790
goals that people can set which are

627
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:45,319
better yields and better potency now

628
00:20:43,789 --> 00:20:47,779
something people don't think about is

629
00:20:45,319 --> 00:20:49,609
better scheduling and planning let's

630
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:51,379
work on scheduling our gardens and

631
00:20:49,609 --> 00:20:54,428
harvests a little bit better

632
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:55,640
how many harvests do you want to pool in

633
00:20:54,429 --> 00:20:58,519
2018

634
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:59,179
can you pull six harvests in 2018 out of

635
00:20:58,519 --> 00:21:00,980
your grow room

636
00:20:59,179 --> 00:21:03,350
can you pull five harvests out of your

637
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:04,880
grow room in 2018 maybe you've got

638
00:21:03,349 --> 00:21:06,589
multiple lights and you're running a

639
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,840
perpetual grow in there are you gonna

640
00:21:06,589 --> 00:21:11,149
try and pull 52 harvests out of a grow

641
00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:13,759
room this year have a goal have some

642
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:16,160
schedules going you should know how long

643
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:17,929
it takes for your plants to flower most

644
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:20,300
of us are running nine week plants if

645
00:21:17,929 --> 00:21:22,550
you've got nine week plants you need to

646
00:21:20,299 --> 00:21:24,019
have veg plants ready to replace them

647
00:21:22,549 --> 00:21:25,849
when they harvest at the end of week

648
00:21:24,019 --> 00:21:27,980
nine so you need to decide how long

649
00:21:25,849 --> 00:21:30,619
you're going to veg you need to decide

650
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:32,329
how long it takes you to clone most of

651
00:21:30,619 --> 00:21:34,339
us can get clones rooted in about two

652
00:21:32,329 --> 00:21:36,199
weeks so if you've got a nine week cycle

653
00:21:34,339 --> 00:21:38,539
you need to allow yourself two weeks to

654
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:40,610
cut clones then however many weeks of

655
00:21:38,539 --> 00:21:42,889
veg you want probably about four weeks

656
00:21:40,609 --> 00:21:44,479
of veg for most of us so that's six

657
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:47,030
weeks that means if you're running a

658
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:50,029
nine week flower cycle at week three of

659
00:21:47,029 --> 00:21:52,549
flower you need to cut new clones so

660
00:21:50,029 --> 00:21:54,799
that they can ruin 14 days and they can

661
00:21:52,549 --> 00:21:56,869
veg for four weeks and then as soon as

662
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:58,849
you cut down that flower room you can

663
00:21:56,869 --> 00:22:01,549
move those veg plants in there and not

664
00:21:58,849 --> 00:22:03,349
have any downtime I'm not sure of your

665
00:22:01,549 --> 00:22:05,750
schedule but that's a good example of

666
00:22:03,349 --> 00:22:07,699
what you need to start doing if you want

667
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:11,058
to make the best of your grow room a

668
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:13,549
very easy and attainable goal is to set

669
00:22:11,058 --> 00:22:15,349
more scheduling for your grow the

670
00:22:13,549 --> 00:22:17,629
hardest part about that is staying on

671
00:22:15,349 --> 00:22:18,919
top of the schedule once you set it like

672
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:21,170
I talked about at the start of the show

673
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:23,269
I want to make more lemon Jeffery seeds

674
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:25,519
I can't do it until the summer because I

675
00:22:23,269 --> 00:22:28,190
have scheduled my rooms out for at least

676
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:29,539
the next six months and I know that

677
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:30,920
sounds like a long time but if you think

678
00:22:29,539 --> 00:22:32,509
about it that's only three crops in a

679
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:34,429
certain in one room if you're flowering

680
00:22:32,509 --> 00:22:37,879
in one room six months three crops

681
00:22:34,429 --> 00:22:39,440
that's actually 2.75 crops because

682
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:41,540
there's a few extra days there at the

683
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,490
end because we do the nine week cycles

684
00:22:41,539 --> 00:22:46,970
and not four so that's gonna be like

685
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:49,039
2.75 crops but my point is that I've got

686
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:50,118
it scheduled I've got a plan I know what

687
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:52,249
I'm gonna do and I'm

688
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:54,499
going to do my best to stay on that

689
00:22:52,249 --> 00:22:57,199
schedule and not mess myself up if I do

690
00:22:54,499 --> 00:22:59,239
it right I know how many cycles I'll be

691
00:22:57,199 --> 00:23:01,129
able to get this year out of that room I

692
00:22:59,239 --> 00:23:02,689
have a good estimation of how many seeds

693
00:23:01,128 --> 00:23:05,208
I'll be able to produce out of that room

694
00:23:02,689 --> 00:23:07,129
this year it just helps you plan it

695
00:23:05,209 --> 00:23:09,318
helps you stay on top of things and it

696
00:23:07,128 --> 00:23:11,148
helps you set goals so set some goals

697
00:23:09,318 --> 00:23:13,398
you guys so far we've set goals to get

698
00:23:11,148 --> 00:23:15,228
better yields better potency and better

699
00:23:13,398 --> 00:23:17,478
scheduling now let's talk about random

700
00:23:15,229 --> 00:23:19,869
things that you guys may be able to set

701
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:21,889
a goal to get better at and your grow

702
00:23:19,868 --> 00:23:24,378
something a lot of us could get better

703
00:23:21,888 --> 00:23:27,378
at in our grow is cloning how is your

704
00:23:24,378 --> 00:23:30,738
clone tech are 70% of your clones living

705
00:23:27,378 --> 00:23:32,418
are 80% of your clones living how many

706
00:23:30,739 --> 00:23:34,009
of your clones live now if you were to

707
00:23:32,419 --> 00:23:37,369
cut a hundred clones how many do you

708
00:23:34,009 --> 00:23:40,278
think would be surviving and usable in

709
00:23:37,368 --> 00:23:41,749
about 15 days if I said hey dude let's

710
00:23:40,278 --> 00:23:44,118
cut a hundred clones together right now

711
00:23:41,749 --> 00:23:46,129
you and me and I'll be back in 14 days

712
00:23:44,118 --> 00:23:47,328
how many of them would you be proud to

713
00:23:46,128 --> 00:23:49,759
show me and how many of them would you

714
00:23:47,328 --> 00:23:51,918
be embarrassed to show me so if you said

715
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:54,288
50 of them would have died let's

716
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:55,189
increase your clone success rate to 70

717
00:23:54,288 --> 00:23:57,138
percent this year

718
00:23:55,189 --> 00:23:59,509
if you said 70 percent let's get you up

719
00:23:57,138 --> 00:24:01,278
to 90 if you're in the 80 or 90 percent

720
00:23:59,509 --> 00:24:02,568
let's get you a hundred percent success

721
00:24:01,278 --> 00:24:04,429
in your clones I'd like to see everybody

722
00:24:02,568 --> 00:24:06,798
have a hundred percent success with

723
00:24:04,429 --> 00:24:08,298
their clones but I understand there's

724
00:24:06,798 --> 00:24:09,888
some learning to be done we're not all

725
00:24:08,298 --> 00:24:11,358
spending all day in a garden we're not

726
00:24:09,888 --> 00:24:14,418
all spending all of our time learning

727
00:24:11,358 --> 00:24:16,638
about cannabis but a goal that is

728
00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:18,259
attainable is improvement so if you're

729
00:24:16,638 --> 00:24:20,028
at fifty percent let's get you to 70 if

730
00:24:18,259 --> 00:24:21,909
you're at 70 let's get you to 85 or 90

731
00:24:20,028 --> 00:24:24,169
let's just improve your clone technique

732
00:24:21,909 --> 00:24:25,009
everybody can get better at cloning all

733
00:24:24,169 --> 00:24:27,679
you have to do is pay more attention

734
00:24:25,009 --> 00:24:29,358
maybe leave the clones alone I see a lot

735
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:31,009
of people [ __ ] with clones too much and

736
00:24:29,358 --> 00:24:32,928
that's where they ruin them so let's get

737
00:24:31,009 --> 00:24:34,969
you better at your clone technique and

738
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:36,469
then another thing that people can

739
00:24:34,969 --> 00:24:38,328
definitely improve on at the totally

740
00:24:36,469 --> 00:24:41,328
opposite end of the girl from cloning is

741
00:24:38,328 --> 00:24:43,759
the drying and curing process I see a

742
00:24:41,328 --> 00:24:45,678
lot of people grow amazing cannabis they

743
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:47,509
grow it they take great pictures they

744
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:49,369
cut it down they trim it like a [ __ ]

745
00:24:47,509 --> 00:24:51,348
champ they take more pictures and then

746
00:24:49,368 --> 00:24:53,118
they ruin it by not drying and curing it

747
00:24:51,348 --> 00:24:54,769
properly I have put out a couple of

748
00:24:53,118 --> 00:24:56,208
episodes about drying and curing I will

749
00:24:54,769 --> 00:24:57,858
answer your questions about drying and

750
00:24:56,209 --> 00:25:00,318
curing if you email me I will help you

751
00:24:57,858 --> 00:25:02,598
out so all of the crops that you're

752
00:25:00,318 --> 00:25:03,240
going to produce this year in 2018 that

753
00:25:02,598 --> 00:25:05,428
you have got

754
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:07,049
and planned for your goals you're going

755
00:25:05,429 --> 00:25:08,790
to have to learn to dry and cure them

756
00:25:07,049 --> 00:25:11,308
better let's make that one of your goals

757
00:25:08,789 --> 00:25:13,619
for 2018 even if you're already an

758
00:25:11,308 --> 00:25:15,359
amazing grower if you're a pro grower if

759
00:25:13,619 --> 00:25:17,308
you know how to cure weed you can do it

760
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:19,919
better especially if you're in Colorado

761
00:25:17,308 --> 00:25:22,079
so let's work on learning to dry and

762
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:24,269
cure a little better that is a goal that

763
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:26,308
you can achieve and if we say just a

764
00:25:24,269 --> 00:25:28,379
little better you just have to do better

765
00:25:26,308 --> 00:25:29,789
than last year and if you grow five or

766
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:32,150
six crops you're gonna get five or six

767
00:25:29,789 --> 00:25:35,129
good chances at getting better this year

768
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:36,480
so drying and curing is something we can

769
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:38,520
all work on and if you need more

770
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,589
guidance on that email me to grow from

771
00:25:38,519 --> 00:25:42,389
your heart at hotmail.com I will talk

772
00:25:40,589 --> 00:25:44,189
you through drying and curing I will

773
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:47,160
write out an SOP and we will get your

774
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:49,220
cannabis dried properly all right and

775
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:52,080
one more thing that you can work on in

776
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:54,808
2018 that you can improve on a goal that

777
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:57,659
you can set would be to become more cost

778
00:25:54,808 --> 00:25:59,609
efficient if you are a new grower if

779
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:01,259
you're a pro grower if you're an expert

780
00:25:59,609 --> 00:26:02,789
if you're growing in a closet if you're

781
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:04,920
running a large commercial facility

782
00:26:02,789 --> 00:26:07,500
there are ways that you can become more

783
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:09,210
cost effective are you wasting

784
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:10,679
electricity somewhere are you wasting

785
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:12,179
nutrients somewhere are you wasting

786
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:15,780
product somewhere are you wasting time

787
00:26:12,179 --> 00:26:18,390
somewhere let's look at our process in

788
00:26:15,779 --> 00:26:20,220
the garden and streamline the time that

789
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:22,620
we spend in there and streamline the

790
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:24,210
money that we spend in there maybe we're

791
00:26:22,619 --> 00:26:25,649
wasting water somewhere let's figure

792
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:28,049
that out maybe we're wasting electricity

793
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:30,269
somewhere let's figure that out do you

794
00:26:28,049 --> 00:26:31,769
have a fan and air conditioner and a

795
00:26:30,269 --> 00:26:33,900
blower on at the same time that maybe

796
00:26:31,769 --> 00:26:35,460
you only need two of those if you're

797
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:37,410
growing for profit if you're drawing for

798
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:39,299
medicine every penny counts either way

799
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:40,830
because somebody's got to pay for it and

800
00:26:39,299 --> 00:26:42,690
if you're drawing electricity if you're

801
00:26:40,829 --> 00:26:44,519
wasting water it's just going down the

802
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:46,170
drain basically and who can afford to

803
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:48,029
put anything down the drain these days

804
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:49,740
and also think about the environmental

805
00:26:48,029 --> 00:26:52,799
factors if you're wasting electricity

806
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:54,390
and wasting water you were destroying

807
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:55,919
the environment for no reason we're

808
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:57,360
running out of resources and wasting

809
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:59,460
money so try to become more cost

810

become more environmentally conscious

812
00:27:01,529 --> 00:27:05,220
that's something that all of us can do

813
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:07,019
we're all buying bottled nutrients that

814
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:08,549
have to be shipped across the country we

815
00:27:07,019 --> 00:27:11,179
use the nutrients we throw the plastic

816
00:27:08,549 --> 00:27:13,619
bottles away let's try to be more

818
00:27:13,619 --> 00:27:16,829

819
00:27:15,419 --> 00:27:20,240

820
00:27:16,829 --> 00:27:22,439
we can all set and try to reach in 2018
