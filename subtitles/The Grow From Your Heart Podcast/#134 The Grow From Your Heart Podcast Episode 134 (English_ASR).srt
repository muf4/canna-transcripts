is what this is on episode number 126

57
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:03,109
we're talking about the organization

58
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:04,879
that was passing out joints to people

59
00:02:03,109 --> 00:02:06,799
who collected trash in the park and we

60
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:08,090
made a comment about how it was not cool

61
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,340
that they were giving out joints in the

62
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:12,110
park I've been corrected you guys big

63
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:13,789
shout out to Lindsey and Chris for

64
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:14,780
correcting me they were listening to the

65
00:02:13,789 --> 00:02:16,189
podcast and they were

66
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:19,159
Hey Dude they did not give the joints

67
00:02:16,189 --> 00:02:20,750
out in the park what happened so we did

68
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:22,699
an article where people collect the

69
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:23,930
trash in the park and they clean up the

70
00:02:22,699 --> 00:02:25,669
park and after they picked up the trash

71
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:26,810
they got a free joint it was under my

72
00:02:25,669 --> 00:02:28,369
assumption they got the joint at the

73
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:30,259
park because of the news kind of made it

74
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:32,030
look that way I was told that they got a

75
00:02:30,259 --> 00:02:34,099
coupon and they had to take the coupon

76
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:36,379
to the smoke Club and the smoke Club

77
00:02:34,099 --> 00:02:38,568
then gave them a joint when they

78
00:02:36,379 --> 00:02:40,310
presented proper ID and that coupon so a

79
00:02:38,568 --> 00:02:42,379
correction had to be made they did not

80
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:44,150
give the joints out at the park they did

81
00:02:42,379 --> 00:02:45,439
it correctly so shout out and also shout

82
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:46,810
out to my friends for correcting me I do

83
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:48,590
appreciate that

84
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:50,030
alright I hope everybody had a great

85
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:51,890
week because I am recording on a

86
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:54,349
Saturday usually I record on a Thursday

87
00:02:51,889 --> 00:02:55,729
but this week was chaotic this week on

88
00:02:54,349 --> 00:02:57,500
Thursday I had a medical marijuana

89
00:02:55,729 --> 00:02:59,030
doctor at 9:30 in the morning in

90
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:01,699
Colorado Springs then I worked all day

91
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:03,890
and then I went to the secret stash the

92
00:03:01,699 --> 00:03:06,199
secret session was amazing oh I almost

93
00:03:03,889 --> 00:03:08,029
forgot part of my day I got up I drove

94
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:09,799
to Colorado Springs and then I got stuck

95
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:11,479
in a [ __ ] elevator yes I've never

96
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,610
been stuck in an elevator before but

97
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:15,250
Thursday morning it happened I was stuck

98
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:17,840
in an elevator with two strangers I

99
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:19,280
wasn't in there for very long it was a

100
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,930
little bit freaky but I didn't panic or

101
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,949
anything says like whatever I'm just in

102
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:23,180
an elevator people know I'm here

103
00:03:21,949 --> 00:03:25,699
someone's gonna get me out it wasn't

104
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:27,409
that big of a deal one of the people in

105
00:03:25,699 --> 00:03:28,909
the elevator was a couple and the older

106
00:03:27,409 --> 00:03:30,469
dude was getting a little bit pissed off

107
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:32,030
if he was stuck in an elevator there's

108
00:03:30,469 --> 00:03:33,799
no reason for him to be mad but I think

109
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:36,409
just the simple idea that he was stuck

110
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:37,849
pissed him off um I was going to the

111
00:03:36,409 --> 00:03:39,769
medical marijuana doctor I walked in

112
00:03:37,849 --> 00:03:41,750
there's no stairs at this building

113
00:03:39,769 --> 00:03:43,849
oddly uh there's an elevator got in the

114
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:46,129
elevator more people walked in I held

115
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:48,379
the door for them I hit floor three it

116
00:03:46,129 --> 00:03:49,669
started to go it went and then it

117
00:03:48,379 --> 00:03:50,629
stopped and I looked at the dude and I

118
00:03:49,669 --> 00:03:52,429
was like I don't know that I want to be

119
00:03:50,629 --> 00:03:53,930
in here he said I think we're stuck in

120
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:56,599
here and I said if it stops and then it

121
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:58,700
stopped I was like well [ __ ] and so I

122
00:03:56,599 --> 00:04:00,199
first my first instinct was trying to

123
00:03:58,699 --> 00:04:01,639
pull the door open just to see where we

124
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:03,289
are you know how far up did we go how

125
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:05,149
far down did we go nor the [ __ ] we went

126
00:04:03,289 --> 00:04:06,858
ah tried to pull the door open

127
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:07,849
it was stuck it was good and stuck so

128
00:04:06,859 --> 00:04:10,040
nothing was gonna happen there's a

129
00:04:07,849 --> 00:04:11,239
little uh an alarm button on the

130
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:12,379
elevator I hit that then there's a

131
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:15,049
button that says call for help I hit

132
00:04:12,379 --> 00:04:16,850
that a couple seconds later a young lady

133
00:04:15,049 --> 00:04:18,228
answered she's like hello and I was like

134
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:19,489
that I just called the front desk or

135
00:04:18,228 --> 00:04:21,199
what the [ __ ] just happened I was like

136
00:04:19,488 --> 00:04:22,639
hey I'm stuck in the elevator and she

137
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,589
asked if I was at the address where I

138
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,149
was and I confirmed that she said okay

139
00:04:24,589 --> 00:04:27,209
hang tight we'll send someone to get you

140
00:04:26,149 --> 00:04:29,310
out

141
00:04:27,209 --> 00:04:31,168
I was like well that's like and I just

142
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:33,089
basic you know what I mean like ask if

143
00:04:31,168 --> 00:04:34,379
we're okay or some [ __ ] geez so we sat

144
00:04:33,089 --> 00:04:37,168
in the elevator for a few minutes and

145
00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:38,459
then another person I kept hitting the

146
00:04:37,168 --> 00:04:39,659
little alarm button they would just go

147
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:41,068
jingle jingle jingle so that somebody

148
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:42,270
would know I was in there and then

149
00:04:41,069 --> 00:04:43,620
another person came and they're like hey

150
00:04:42,269 --> 00:04:45,089
are you stuck and I was Ike yes we're

151
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:46,978
stuck and she just started pushing

152
00:04:45,089 --> 00:04:48,060
buttons and when she pushed up I don't

153
00:04:46,978 --> 00:04:49,620
know which button cuz I wasn't there

154
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:51,360
when she pushed the button I could feel

155
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:53,610
the elevator shift a little bit and I

156
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,169
said hey keep doing that and then I saw

157
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:57,150
through the crack in the door I could

158
00:04:55,168 --> 00:04:58,709
see that we were only six or eight

159
00:04:57,149 --> 00:05:00,569
inches up off the ground we'd only moved

160
00:04:58,709 --> 00:05:02,129
1/2 a foot so I was like keep doing that

161
00:05:00,569 --> 00:05:04,620
cuz we're going down every time she did

162
00:05:02,129 --> 00:05:06,449
it and then I saw I saw the little

163
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:07,709
threshold piece like where the elevator

164
00:05:06,449 --> 00:05:08,759
would fit into the floor and as I hold

165
00:05:07,709 --> 00:05:10,079
on hold on I wanna see something quit

166
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:11,430
pushing it I didn't want her to squish

167
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:12,659
my fingers and I stuck my fingers in

168
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:13,829
there and I totally just pulled the door

169
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:15,229
open so I was able to slide the door

170
00:05:13,829 --> 00:05:17,339
open once she got it a little bit lower

171

if you were at secret session we took a

206
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:23,038
dab much love I was at the secret stash

207
00:06:20,668 --> 00:06:25,109
I was dabbing and Hannah mill said I'm

208
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:26,430
higher than everybody here and I was

209
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:27,840
kind of pretty sure that I was higher

210
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:29,490
than him so I was like no you're not and

211
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:30,869
he saw me he goes Ross and Jeff I see

212
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:32,610
you shaking her head come here bro and

213
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:35,610
he called me up to the stage I went to

214
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:37,050
the stage he his buddy Tim gave me and

215
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:39,000
it was at least a gram I think I took a

216
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:40,060
gram and a half dab on the stage at the

217
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,709
secret session forever

218
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:43,030
and did not choke and then we brought up

219
00:06:41,709 --> 00:06:45,519
a couple of people on the stage and dab

220
00:06:43,029 --> 00:06:47,529
them out that was a pretty good time but

221
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:48,939
honestly I was lit up because I would

222
00:06:47,529 --> 00:06:49,929
give people like a two gram dab and

223
00:06:48,939 --> 00:06:51,579
whatever they couldn't take I would

224
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:53,439
finish it for him and oftentimes it was

225
00:06:51,579 --> 00:06:54,849
most of a gram you trying to dab

226
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:56,050
somebody a two gram dab and they start

227
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:57,700
choking and they look at you like I'm

228
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:59,139
done so I would just grab and finish it

229
00:06:57,699 --> 00:07:00,639
so it's pretty late we took a little

230
00:06:59,139 --> 00:07:02,949
break and went sat in the greenroom and

231
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,180
I ate a bunch of Cheetos uh drinks with

232
00:07:02,949 --> 00:07:05,620
Dr Pepper I usually don't need a bunch

233
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:07,000
of crap but I needed some crap in my

234
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:09,040
body so I had a bunch of junk and drop

235
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,329
my [ __ ] back together while I was

236
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:12,069
sitting in the greenroom chilling out

237
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:13,329
our good friend Lindsay the travelling

238
00:07:12,069 --> 00:07:14,949
stoner showed up and she had her

239
00:07:13,329 --> 00:07:17,168
beautiful friend Molly with her shoutout

240
00:07:14,949 --> 00:07:18,969
to Lindsey and Molly they encouraged me

241
00:07:17,168 --> 00:07:20,439
to have another bag of chips and get my

242
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:23,110
[ __ ] together and then get back to the

243
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:24,639
party so Lindsey and our new friend

244
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:27,879
Molly and I went cruised around the

245
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:30,370
secret sesh and shout out to our friend

246
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:33,519

00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:38,168

250
00:07:38,168 --> 00:07:41,949

251
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:43,720
of them sorry I'm my brain still maybe

252
00:07:41,949 --> 00:07:45,728
fuzzy from the secret session I think

253
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:49,479
there were 250 or 300 milligrams each

254
00:07:45,728 --> 00:07:51,038
and I ate two of those I had some fruit

255
00:07:49,478 --> 00:07:52,930
there was pineapple and strawberries and

256
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:55,300
some other random fruit that was chopped

257
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:57,610
up that had medicated chocolate ganache

258
00:07:55,300 --> 00:08:00,009
that was hot on top of it that's enough

259
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:01,449
it was so tasty so the secret session I

260
00:08:00,009 --> 00:08:02,620
got stupidly if you walked up and tried

261
00:08:01,449 --> 00:08:04,599
to talk to me and I was kind of

262
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:06,639
non-responsive I do apologize I had

263
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:08,560
eaten about 850 to a thousand milligrams

264
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,509
of edibles and I had smoked about four

265
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,769
or five grams of hash so I was in no

266
00:08:10,509 --> 00:08:12,939
condition to be conversational I

267
00:08:11,769 --> 00:08:14,038
apologize but shout out to everyone at

268
00:08:12,939 --> 00:08:17,490

269
00:08:14,038 --> 00:08:21,009
huge shout out to our friends at TNT

270
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:23,918

271
00:08:21,009 --> 00:08:26,649
edibles those dudes gave me a 1000

272
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:29,409
milligram edible and I ate that 1000

273
00:08:26,649 --> 00:08:32,168
milligram edible yesterday on my way to

274
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:34,269
work and by the time I got to work it

275
00:08:32,168 --> 00:08:38,110
felt like somebody had replaced my blood

276
00:08:34,269 --> 00:08:39,399
with sand my body was so dry and heavy

277
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:40,990
that I just wanted to curl up in a

278
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:43,958
corner and take a nap I have not been

279
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:45,549
that ridiculously high in a long time a

280
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:47,679
thousand milligrams is no joke you guys

281
00:08:45,549 --> 00:08:49,449
I do not recommend it I don't know that

282
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:51,759
I want to do it again I feel like I

283
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:53,980
wasted probably a day and a half because

284
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:55,689
the entire day I was useless and then

285
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:57,730
half of today it took me half of today

286
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:59,019
to get my [ __ ] together so a thousand

287
00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:00,550
milligrams will [ __ ] you up if that's

288
00:08:59,019 --> 00:09:02,019
what you're looking for but oh my god I

289
00:09:00,549 --> 00:09:04,359
don't recommend it it was an adventure

290
00:09:02,019 --> 00:09:06,909
it was it was like a shamanic journey

291
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:08,139
but I had to go and live my day doing it

292
00:09:06,909 --> 00:09:10,059
I had to go to work and I had to

293
00:09:08,139 --> 00:09:11,528
function so that's kind of hard don't do

294
00:09:10,059 --> 00:09:12,219
that unless you can lay around and just

295
00:09:11,528 --> 00:09:14,259
be lazy

296
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:15,459
so shout it to those folks shout it to

297
00:09:14,259 --> 00:09:17,019

a hell of a good comment thank you I

331
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:23,230
appreciate that that's something I

332
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:26,409
noticed when I used to listen to another

333
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:28,509
cannabis podcast people would ask aggro

334
00:10:26,409 --> 00:10:30,399
question and instead of giving solid Gro

335
00:10:28,509 --> 00:10:32,889
advice the host of that show would sell

336
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:34,629
you a product and it wouldn't solve your

337
00:10:32,889 --> 00:10:36,129
problem it would temporarily solve your

338
00:10:34,629 --> 00:10:37,509
problem it would mask your problem is

339
00:10:36,129 --> 00:10:39,189
what it would do and then you'd have to

340
00:10:37,509 --> 00:10:40,720
keep buying that product what I like to

341
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:42,790
do is if you have a problem in your grow

342
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,899
if you say hey I have spider mites I

343
00:10:42,789 --> 00:10:45,519
like to help you figure out how you're

344
00:10:43,899 --> 00:10:47,110
getting spider mites teach you how to

345
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,639
correct that so that you don't ever get

346
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:50,800
mites again instead of having to buy

347
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:52,120
some product that is sponsoring me over

348
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:54,809
and over again I don't think that's cool

349
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:57,490
so I do appreciate that you notice that

350
00:10:54,809 --> 00:10:59,138
free and entertaining and informative

351
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:01,000

352

422

a copy of your badge and probably a copy

425
00:13:12,769 --> 00:13:16,879
of your ID and there will probably be

426
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:18,559
more documents attached that [ __ ] don't

427

about this a friend of mine got an email

431
00:13:24,389 --> 00:13:29,698

432
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:32,399
my friend's name is Lee the email said

433
00:13:29,698 --> 00:13:34,769
hey Bryan this indicates to me and Lee

434
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,239
that this email was a mass email sent to

435
00:13:34,769 --> 00:13:37,889
multiple people and all the person was

436
00:13:36,239 --> 00:13:40,230
doing was going and changing the name is

437
00:13:37,889 --> 00:13:41,850
who the letter was addressed to you guys

438

439
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:45,928
sending an application or a resume

badge in your intro email that's the

445
00:13:53,938 --> 00:13:57,088
truth if you're applying for a job do

446
00:13:55,499 --> 00:13:59,159
not ask the person giving you the job

447
00:13:57,089 --> 00:14:01,019
how to get your badge that's on you

448

450
00:14:02,818 --> 00:14:07,198

00:14:15,298 --> 00:14:18,419
about the problems at the old place that

458
00:14:17,188 --> 00:14:19,738
means that you're dramatic that means

459
00:14:18,419 --> 00:14:22,528

471
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:46,948

presentable you will be around products

488
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:20,579
that people are going to buy and consume

489
00:15:18,379 --> 00:15:22,350
people don't want scuzzy people hovering

490
00:15:20,578 --> 00:15:23,578
over their cake or their baked goods

491
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:25,110
you don't want scuzzy people hovering

492
00:15:23,578 --> 00:15:27,359
over the medicine that you're going to

493
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:29,129
smoke especially in a medical dispensary

494
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,438
we need clean people we need a clean

495
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:32,999
environment so guys those were a few

496
00:15:31,438 --> 00:15:33,360
tips that my friend Nicole posted to

497
00:15:32,999 --> 00:15:34,649
face

498
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,289
I thought it would be really helpful to

499
00:15:34,649 --> 00:15:38,999
share this it's kind of a smartass stab

500
00:15:37,289 --> 00:15:41,219
at the people trying to get a job but

501
00:15:38,999 --> 00:15:42,989
it's so real that it was worth sharing

502
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:45,209
so she meant to post something smartass

503
00:15:42,989 --> 00:15:46,290
I took it seriously because some people

504
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:47,548
need some help with this I thought it

505
00:15:46,289 --> 00:15:49,198

he's a cool ass dude it makes him really

548
00:17:06,088 --> 00:17:09,928
funny memes ah sometimes I act like I

549
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:11,519
don't see them because I don't even know

550
00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:13,199
what the [ __ ] to say so he sent me a

551
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:15,058
long Facebook message with several

552
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:18,389
questions I'm gonna go through a couple

553
00:17:15,058 --> 00:17:20,730
of them here the first one he says how

554
00:17:18,388 --> 00:17:23,578
can a humble simple ganja farmer folk

555
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:26,250
avoid buying an RO and get rid of clora

556
00:17:23,578 --> 00:17:29,759
mines is asking how he can get rid of

557
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:32,220
the chlorine and whatever else the water

558
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:34,200
company is putting in your water without

559
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:35,639
buying a reverse osmosis machine because

560
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,200
those are quite expensive and sometimes

561
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:38,788
people can't afford that sometimes you

562
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:42,000
don't have word of anywhere to put it

563
00:17:38,788 --> 00:17:43,769
so how can a simple ganja farmer get rid

564
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,690
of the chlorine and the stuff that the

565
00:17:43,769 --> 00:17:48,819
city is putting in our municipal water

566
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:50,649
quite simply you can put it in a giant

567
00:17:48,819 --> 00:17:52,598
jug and set it in the Sun and the Sun

568
00:17:50,648 --> 00:17:55,329
will help evaporate off any of those

569
00:17:52,598 --> 00:17:56,798
contaminants also I recommend pudding if

570
00:17:55,329 --> 00:17:58,989
you need to do it indoors if you have to

571
00:17:56,798 --> 00:18:00,759
do it indoors most of us have to put the

572
00:17:58,989 --> 00:18:02,950
water put the tap water in a reservoir

573
00:18:00,759 --> 00:18:04,960
whatever size you're using and put a lot

574
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:06,489
of air stones in there put air stones in

575
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,139
there and make it bubble real heavily

576
00:18:06,489 --> 00:18:10,659
because then you'll move all that water

577
00:18:08,138 --> 00:18:11,738
around in surface area excuse me for

578
00:18:10,659 --> 00:18:13,479
clearing my throat over and over again

579
00:18:11,739 --> 00:18:14,798
but surface area is what you're trying

580
00:18:13,479 --> 00:18:16,028
to create so you want to bring some of

581
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:17,378
that water from the bottom up to the top

582
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:18,729
and help move some of that chlorine

583
00:18:17,378 --> 00:18:21,398
that's trapped in there up to the top

584
00:18:18,729 --> 00:18:23,798
and then it can evaporate so the easiest

585
00:18:21,398 --> 00:18:25,478
way is just to put your water in a big

586
00:18:23,798 --> 00:18:26,679
container and put air stones in it and

587
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:29,048
bubble the [ __ ] out of it get your night

588
00:18:26,679 --> 00:18:30,729
self a nice air and air bubble or what

589
00:18:29,048 --> 00:18:32,229
do they call an air pump I just get

590
00:18:30,729 --> 00:18:34,058
yourself a nice powerful one they make

591
00:18:32,229 --> 00:18:34,659
one that's got like 8 air things coming

592
00:18:34,058 --> 00:18:37,210
off of it

593
00:18:34,659 --> 00:18:38,619
put all 8 of them in like a 30 gallon

594
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:40,419
trash can and fill that sucker with

595
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:41,978
water and just pump the [ __ ] out of the

596
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:43,149
air into there and that'll get rid of

597
00:18:41,979 --> 00:18:44,499
the chlorine of the core amide or

598
00:18:43,148 --> 00:18:46,628
whatever you're worried about in there

599
00:18:44,499 --> 00:18:47,919
we'll get rid of most of it and then of

600
00:18:46,628 --> 00:18:49,569
course before you give that to your

601
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:51,669
plants make sure you adjust the pH check

602
00:18:49,569 --> 00:18:52,778
the pH of that adjust it before you feed

603
00:18:51,669 --> 00:18:54,759
it to your plants depending on the

604
00:18:52,778 --> 00:18:55,960
plants age their pH they will want

605
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:57,548
different stuff so that's how you get

606
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:59,019
rid of that stuff and it's free and it

607
00:18:57,548 --> 00:19:00,759
doesn't take much but time and a little

608
00:18:59,019 --> 00:19:03,669
bit of energy you may have to go buy

609
00:19:00,759 --> 00:19:05,378
yourself an air pump the second question

610
00:19:03,669 --> 00:19:09,038
said asked is thoughts on Michael Raisa

611
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:12,579
and trichoderma bacteria beneficials do

612
00:19:09,038 --> 00:19:15,069
you use and how much so he wants to know

613
00:19:12,579 --> 00:19:16,449
which of these beneficials i use and how

614
00:19:15,069 --> 00:19:19,269
much there are several brands out there

615
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:20,710
they're mostly the same you guys I like

616
00:19:19,269 --> 00:19:23,288
there are several brands that I like I

617
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:25,509
really like great white shark sometimes

618
00:19:23,288 --> 00:19:27,190
I like oh jee bio war I like a lot of

619
00:19:25,509 --> 00:19:30,128
different things the chunkier white ones

620
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:33,429
seem to work the best for me umm how

621
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:35,079
much a whole bunch when I put my when my

622
00:19:33,429 --> 00:19:36,309
seedlings come or when my clones come

623
00:19:35,079 --> 00:19:38,589
out of the cloner they're going into a

624
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:39,908
cup of soil or a small pot of soil I

625
00:19:38,589 --> 00:19:41,558
like to sprinkle a little bit of the

626
00:19:39,909 --> 00:19:43,720
great white shark around the base area

627
00:19:41,558 --> 00:19:46,089
where the roots are gonna hit and then

628
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:48,069
put or also I can't forget this one

629
00:19:46,089 --> 00:19:50,019
dragonfly earth medicine they make a

630
00:19:48,069 --> 00:19:52,089
lush roots is also a great product for

631
00:19:50,019 --> 00:19:53,829
this dust the roots in there or put a

632
00:19:52,089 --> 00:19:55,478
little right where the roots are gonna

633
00:19:53,829 --> 00:19:57,728
go and then bury the plant into that and

634
00:19:55,479 --> 00:19:59,548
then when I let the roots grow in that

635
00:19:57,729 --> 00:20:01,230
cup or a small container for a long

636
00:19:59,548 --> 00:20:02,519
until it's almost too much and then I

637
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:05,009
transplant it into the next container

638
00:20:02,519 --> 00:20:05,940
and as I do I'll cope right where I'm

639
00:20:05,009 --> 00:20:07,499
gonna put the plant

640
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:10,739
I'll coat that area with just a sprinkle

641
00:20:07,499 --> 00:20:12,329
of whatever powdered root inoculants

642
00:20:10,739 --> 00:20:14,989
sort of thing that I'm gonna use if it's

643
00:20:12,329 --> 00:20:16,980
great white shark if it's OG bio war

644
00:20:14,989 --> 00:20:18,899
whichever brand you're using you can use

645
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:20,308
ogt there are a whole bunch of different

646
00:20:18,898 --> 00:20:22,319
products they're mostly the same I

647
00:20:20,308 --> 00:20:24,388
really like the great white shark it's

648
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:26,128
affordable its cost effective OG bio war

649
00:20:24,388 --> 00:20:27,658
is affordable its cost effective it's

650
00:20:26,128 --> 00:20:29,908
worth its weight in gold in my opinion

651
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:31,619
so those would be the two I'd recommend

652
00:20:29,909 --> 00:20:33,809
the great white shark or the og bio war

653
00:20:31,618 --> 00:20:36,209
and you can't use too much use it when

654
00:20:33,808 --> 00:20:37,319
you go from the cloner into the cup and

655
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:38,819
then when you go from the cup into the

656
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:41,849
pot and then if you go into another pot

657
00:20:38,819 --> 00:20:43,079
do it again every time right where

658
00:20:41,849 --> 00:20:44,579
you're putting those roots the fresh

659
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:45,569
roots just put some of that into the

660
00:20:44,579 --> 00:20:48,329
dirt right where those roots are gonna

661
00:20:45,569 --> 00:20:50,220
touch and then I like to fill a

662
00:20:48,329 --> 00:20:51,928
container with clean water and then I

663
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:53,759
just mix the powdered solution into the

664
00:20:51,929 --> 00:20:56,548
water with my nutrients and feed it to

665
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:57,960
the plants just like a water feed just

666
00:20:56,548 --> 00:20:59,308
like I feed all my other nutrients and I

667
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:01,379
feel that that helps soak it in there

668
00:20:59,308 --> 00:21:02,970
real good so now I've got something that

669
00:21:01,378 --> 00:21:04,048
was in there with the roots when I put

670
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:05,460
it in there in the dirt it's already

671
00:21:04,048 --> 00:21:07,288
touching it the roots are eating it and

672
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:09,509
then I feed some in kind of like a tea

673
00:21:07,288 --> 00:21:11,460
so that it can get more I really like to

674
00:21:09,509 --> 00:21:13,700
give it that sort of stuff give it all

675
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:15,929
and give it excuse me once again give it

676
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:18,480
give it these things all through the veg

677
00:21:15,929 --> 00:21:21,869
phase like maybe once every other week

678
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:24,659
through the veg phase and then do it the

679
00:21:21,868 --> 00:21:26,128
first three weeks and flour would not be

680
00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:27,450
a bad idea at all because you want to

681
00:21:26,128 --> 00:21:30,209
build those roots and keep those roots

682
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:33,179
moving so I hope that answered your

683
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:36,600
question dude which uh which beneficials

684
00:21:33,179 --> 00:21:38,669
do I recommend so the next question you

685
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:40,498
said my thoughts on LED lights the

686
00:21:38,669 --> 00:21:42,239
benefits you're thinking better tricone

687
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:44,579
production maybe if used in conjunction

688
00:21:42,239 --> 00:21:47,690
with HBS not to mention energy savings

689
00:21:44,579 --> 00:21:50,099
ten to one for similar lumens output

690
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:52,019
I've seen a lot of great [ __ ] come from

691
00:21:50,099 --> 00:21:54,480
LED lights I don't have any experience

692
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:56,759
with them honestly they're expensive and

693
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,710
I'm afraid to invest in a white that's

694
00:21:56,759 --> 00:22:01,259
not going to make my plants perform the

695
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:03,389
way that they need um in the right

696
00:22:01,259 --> 00:22:06,659
situation if you're in a small area and

697
00:22:03,388 --> 00:22:08,368
you can't run a big light do it if what

698
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:10,440
you're able to do is run an LED run an

699
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:12,178
LED my friend Amanda has an LED and I've

700
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,640
seen pictures of her cannabis plants and

701
00:22:12,179 --> 00:22:16,059
they

702
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:17,440
good uh I can't argue with the led my

703
00:22:16,058 --> 00:22:19,298
friend Nancy Budd well I don't know if

704
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,400
she listens to this podcast but shout

705
00:22:19,298 --> 00:22:23,740
out to Nancy she grows with the lush led

706
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:25,509
and her plants look [ __ ] stellar her

707
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:27,190
plants look really really good she does

708
00:22:25,509 --> 00:22:28,900
a great job I've seen a lot of great

709
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:32,710
stuff from LEDs I just don't have any

710
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:34,840
experience you are totally accurate with

711
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:36,548
the cost-effectiveness of LEDs they

712
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:38,859
really do keep electricity costs down

713
00:22:36,548 --> 00:22:40,298
the lights themselves don't pull as much

714
00:22:38,859 --> 00:22:41,859
power which means they don't make as

715
00:22:40,298 --> 00:22:44,259
much heat which means you don't need as

716
00:22:41,859 --> 00:22:46,599
much air-conditioning so it's really

717
00:22:44,259 --> 00:22:49,179
beneficial it is a good thing if you get

718
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:50,918
the right LEDs I'm sure that there are

719
00:22:49,179 --> 00:22:52,210
some cheap china-made ones out there

720
00:22:50,919 --> 00:22:53,740
that you wouldn't want to purchase I'm

721
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:56,640
sure there are some great american-made

722
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:58,690
LEDs that would work very well so just

723
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,980
do your research if you're gonna buy an

724
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:01,630
LED I guess that's the best I could say

725
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:02,679
on there tricone production yeah it's

726
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:04,059
gonna help you out with tricone

727
00:23:02,679 --> 00:23:05,950
production because you're getting more

728
00:23:04,058 --> 00:23:07,599
types of light it's gonna make the

729
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:10,210
plants grow a little bit differently

730
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:11,889
also it's gonna change then gosh I'm

731
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:14,829
sorry you guys I'm just choking up over

732
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:16,150
here it's gonna change the nutritive

733
00:23:14,829 --> 00:23:17,409
cycle of that plant a little bit it's

734
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:18,790
gonna speed it up a little bit I feel

735
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:20,650
like cuz it's getting more different

736
00:23:18,789 --> 00:23:21,849
light so you're gonna probably need to

737
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:23,320
feed a little bit differently there will

738
00:23:21,849 --> 00:23:26,379
be adjustments to be made if you shift

739
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:28,990
shift from an HP S to an LED or if you

740
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:30,370
add an LED to your HP s room you're

741
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:31,690
gonna see different [ __ ] happening that

742
00:23:30,369 --> 00:23:34,750
you're gonna have to adjust to

743
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:37,330
I saw sub cool hanging a lush LED in his

744
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:40,150
HBS room and the plant underneath it

745
00:23:37,329 --> 00:23:41,619
hated it but that's just because it

746
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:43,720
wasn't sub cools Gro style so you're

747
00:23:41,619 --> 00:23:45,159
gonna have to adjust some [ __ ] I hope

748
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:48,190
that answered your question about LEDs

749
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:50,350
in my opinion so the next one is why I

750
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:53,410
want to ask why more commercial grows

751
00:23:50,349 --> 00:23:56,079
don't get solar to offset massive power

752
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:58,029
costs honestly at the amount of

753
00:23:56,079 --> 00:24:00,939
electricity we're using I don't know

754
00:23:58,029 --> 00:24:03,129
that solar would even be a viable source

755
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:04,179
I honestly don't know enough about solar

756
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:07,660
that's something I would have to

757
00:24:04,179 --> 00:24:10,900
research but honestly I we pull we've

758
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:14,769
got a t5 1000 watt lights in one room

759
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:16,870
and 25 1000 watt lights in another room

760
00:24:14,769 --> 00:24:19,490
the electricity bill is high dude and

761
00:24:16,869 --> 00:24:21,918
we've also got

762
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:23,509
[ __ ] tons tons and tons of

763
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:26,450
airconditioning on top of that building

764
00:24:23,509 --> 00:24:27,829
that just keep us cool all day it was

765
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:29,840
really warm today well not really warm

766
00:24:27,829 --> 00:24:31,339
it was fairly warm to the outside it's

767
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:33,589
gonna get way hotter but it was fairly

768
00:24:31,339 --> 00:24:35,209
warm and the building was nice and cool

769
00:24:33,589 --> 00:24:36,379
was probably 74 degrees in the whole

770
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:38,179
building and we've got a nice office

771
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:41,270
space we've got a trim area so there's a

772
00:24:38,179 --> 00:24:42,798
[ __ ] ton of lights I don't think that

773
00:24:41,269 --> 00:24:44,000
motorcycle was so loud I hope you guys

774
00:24:42,798 --> 00:24:45,798
heard that cuz it kind of scared the

775
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,369
[ __ ] at me I don't think that we could

776
00:24:45,798 --> 00:24:51,079
get enough electricity through solar to

777
00:24:49,369 --> 00:24:53,329
run all of the stuff that we have of

778
00:24:51,079 --> 00:24:56,000
course I am NOT an electrical engineer

779
00:24:53,329 --> 00:24:57,798
or anywhere educated in any means of

780
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,909
solar power but that's my opinion that's

781
00:24:57,798 --> 00:25:01,099
what I would assume that's what I would

782
00:24:58,909 --> 00:25:03,230
guess dude so then he asked me question

783
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:04,908
number five said said how do you keep so

784
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:07,278
cool under pressure when the cop pulled

785
00:25:04,909 --> 00:25:08,929
you over and then he also said being

786
00:25:07,278 --> 00:25:10,700
responsible for so much medicine and

787
00:25:08,929 --> 00:25:12,559
patients as it does it keep you awake at

788
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:14,659
night worrying about timers and stuff

789
00:25:12,558 --> 00:25:18,349
any tips on how to relax and not freak

790
00:25:14,659 --> 00:25:20,539
out like I tend to well [ __ ] bro I I

791
00:25:18,349 --> 00:25:22,339
didn't worry about timers and stuff

792
00:25:20,538 --> 00:25:23,898
until you just pointed it out now I'm

793
00:25:22,339 --> 00:25:26,000
having a damn panic attack and I want to

794
00:25:23,898 --> 00:25:27,408
check the cameras on my phone and see if

795
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,519
everything if the Gros is cool and I'm

796
00:25:27,409 --> 00:25:30,620
just kidding I'm just totally joking

797
00:25:28,519 --> 00:25:31,940
with you um how do I keep my cool under

798
00:25:30,619 --> 00:25:35,028
pressure like when that cop pulled me

799
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:36,769
over well I'm a grown-ass adult and that

800
00:25:35,028 --> 00:25:38,929
cops just a grown-ass man with the job

801
00:25:36,769 --> 00:25:43,490
to do and I didn't have anything to hide

802
00:25:38,929 --> 00:25:45,500
and I guess being a white dude with a

803
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:46,788
nice car probably helped me out so I

804
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:49,190
didn't feel like it was worried about

805
00:25:46,788 --> 00:25:51,140
too much and because I mean we know I'm

806
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:52,308
not even kidding if I was a different

807
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:53,990
race it could have been a totally

808
00:25:52,308 --> 00:25:55,190
different outcome I'm not accusing this

809
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:57,200
cop of anything but we know how things

810
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:58,820
go so being a spoiled white dude helps

811
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:01,909
me out for sure in that case keeping my

812
00:25:58,819 --> 00:26:04,158
cool with the cops and I'm just well

813
00:26:01,909 --> 00:26:06,080
educated and I speak well and I'm very

814
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:07,700
sociable so I don't worry about cops

815
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:09,408
they're just people with a job to do and

816
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:11,870
if you're not doing anything stupid and

817
00:26:09,409 --> 00:26:14,120
hiding anything most of the time you

818
00:26:11,869 --> 00:26:17,000
should be cool I feel like and so I just

819
00:26:14,119 --> 00:26:18,079
I hoped for that I guess that's how I

820
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,880
stayed cool the cops

821
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:22,730
honestly I'm not intimidated by people

822
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:25,549
people are people if the person next to

823
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:27,259
me is Rasta Seb if the person next to me

824
00:26:25,548 --> 00:26:29,179
is white Mike if the person sitting next

825
00:26:27,259 --> 00:26:31,009
to me is Lindsay or if the person

826
00:26:29,179 --> 00:26:33,370
sitting next to me is the President or

827
00:26:31,009 --> 00:26:36,369
if the person sitting next to me is

828
00:26:33,369 --> 00:26:38,229
whoever I am feel the same there people

829
00:26:36,369 --> 00:26:40,329
we're all humans we all fart we all poop

830
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:41,799
we all have to go pee we all need to eat

831
00:26:40,329 --> 00:26:43,149
food to live life we all have feelings

832
00:26:41,799 --> 00:26:44,500
we're all those people so I don't people

833
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:46,630
might make me nervous they were all just

834
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:48,369
people like rock stars are just people

835
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:49,540
that play guitars real well I don't get

836
00:26:48,369 --> 00:26:52,000
nervous around people so that's how I

837
00:26:49,539 --> 00:26:54,609
keep cool in that situation the part

838
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,289
about being responsible for so much

839
00:26:54,609 --> 00:26:59,349
medicine and patience and does it keep

840
00:26:56,289 --> 00:27:02,109
me awake at night no because I wouldn't

841
00:26:59,349 --> 00:27:03,639
be in the position if the people that

842
00:27:02,109 --> 00:27:06,219
put me that let me have this position

843
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:08,740
didn't have full trust of me and I would

844
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:09,970
not I wouldn't even do it if I didn't

845
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:11,529
have faith in myself that I could do

846
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:13,390
this I would say straight up like hey

847
00:27:11,529 --> 00:27:16,869
this is not my thing I can't handle this

848
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:18,940
and also I've got good backup it is my I

849
00:27:16,869 --> 00:27:21,669
do run that grill by myself for the most

850
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:23,529
part but if I need help I can call hunt

851
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:24,910
hunt will come help I can call Zach Zach

852
00:27:23,529 --> 00:27:28,058
will come help I have a tremor that's

853
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:29,920
their trimmin eight days a week now so I

854
00:27:28,058 --> 00:27:31,480
can have him help me if there is trouble

855
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:33,190
in the grow that I need help with so

856
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:34,509
yeah I am responsible for it but it

857
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:36,370
doesn't keep me awake at night

858
00:27:34,509 --> 00:27:38,230
I've got it figured out I know the

859
00:27:36,369 --> 00:27:39,459
building really well I know every timer

860
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:41,410
in the building I know what time

861
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:43,269
everything clicks on what time

862
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:45,160
everything clicks off I know what the

863
00:27:43,269 --> 00:27:48,609
temperature is in each room right now so

864
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:50,170
I don't worry too much about that and

865
00:27:48,609 --> 00:27:53,829
then you said does it keep you awake at

866
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:56,740
night worrying about timers and stuff so

867
00:27:53,829 --> 00:27:58,419
one time dude uh it was late it was

868
00:27:56,740 --> 00:28:00,039
midnight and I was laying down to go to

869
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:01,690
sleep and I thought I should check the

870
00:28:00,039 --> 00:28:03,460
cameras at the Gros just to see what's

871
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:06,250
going on and it's an hour away from my

872
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:08,860
house in good weather so I look at the

873
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:10,539
camera and I can see that this one pump

874
00:28:08,859 --> 00:28:13,449
is broken I can see it on the camera

875
00:28:10,539 --> 00:28:15,460
that a tank that should have been fed to

876
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:17,920
these plants was totally full and the

877
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:20,679
pump had not pumped in several hours

878
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:22,080
probably six good hours and if these

879
00:28:20,679 --> 00:28:25,000
plants didn't get a drink of water

880
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:27,579
within the next three or four hours it

881
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,960
probably were gonna die and it was

882
00:28:27,579 --> 00:28:31,449
midnight and I was getting ready to go

883
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,829
to bed and I saw this and so I did the

884
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:34,420
only thing I could do I put on my shoes

885
00:28:32,829 --> 00:28:37,029
and I got in my car and I drove the hour

886
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:38,890
there and I fixed the pump honestly it

887
00:28:37,029 --> 00:28:41,470
took me maybe five minutes to fix that

888
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:43,540
pump ah then I got back in the car and

889
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:45,039
my car broken down it wouldn't start add

890
00:28:43,539 --> 00:28:46,240
up I had to get my car [ __ ] towed

891
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:47,048
home that night that was really funny

892
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,009
cuz

893
00:28:47,048 --> 00:28:51,339
five in the morning by the time I got

894
00:28:48,009 --> 00:28:52,659
home but uh I have cameras I can check

895
00:28:51,339 --> 00:28:54,609
and see if anything goes really wrong

896
00:28:52,659 --> 00:28:57,489
and at this point I've been there long

897
00:28:54,609 --> 00:28:59,048
enough to where I know like I said

898
00:28:57,489 --> 00:29:01,450
earlier I know every timer in that

899
00:28:59,048 --> 00:29:03,819
building I know every breaker in the

900
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:06,278
breaker box I know where I know every if

901
00:29:03,819 --> 00:29:08,168
I'm if a leaf moves in that room I know

902
00:29:06,278 --> 00:29:10,269
which plant it was on that's how well I

903
00:29:08,169 --> 00:29:12,129
know that grow so it doesn't stress me

904
00:29:10,269 --> 00:29:12,819
out too much it doesn't keep me up at

905
00:29:12,128 --> 00:29:14,980
night

906
00:29:12,819 --> 00:29:16,868
ah man if you smoke as much hash as I

907
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:18,970
did and smoked as many edibles as I did

908
00:29:16,868 --> 00:29:22,418
you'd have no problem sleeping at night

909
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:24,190
but I just have faith in myself honestly

910
00:29:22,419 --> 00:29:26,350
I've been doing this for a long time I'm

911
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:28,090
a confident dude I take a lot of notes

912
00:29:26,349 --> 00:29:29,858
honestly I write notes on everything

913
00:29:28,089 --> 00:29:31,839
I've got billions a little post-it notes

914
00:29:29,858 --> 00:29:33,898
all over the grow that helps me out that

915
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:35,829
honestly helps me keep my cool because

916
00:29:33,898 --> 00:29:37,148
they're just all the [ __ ] that I need to

917
00:29:35,829 --> 00:29:38,858
do is right there and once I figure

918
00:29:37,148 --> 00:29:40,329
finish a couple of tasks I cross them

919
00:29:38,858 --> 00:29:42,009
off the list and throw the post-it note

920
00:29:40,329 --> 00:29:43,118
away if you give me something that I

921
00:29:42,009 --> 00:29:44,739
need to remember I just write it down

922
00:29:43,118 --> 00:29:46,599
and I just keep post-it notes that

923
00:29:44,739 --> 00:29:47,829
really helps me that's something that

924
00:29:46,599 --> 00:29:49,388
really helps me keep my [ __ ] together

925
00:29:47,829 --> 00:29:51,249
his notes and then I talk notes into my

00:29:49,388 --> 00:29:52,778
phone also I felt Siri hey Siri make a

927

some mistakes

970
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:18,500
no one's gonna laugh at you maybe we are

971
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:21,830
but laugh at yourself too and if you

972
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:23,390
overflow reservoir get the squeegee and

973
00:31:21,829 --> 00:31:25,639
push that water down to the drain and

974
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:27,830
then mop up the floor and then next time

975
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:29,269
don't overflow that reservoir if you

976
00:31:27,829 --> 00:31:30,889
kill a plant remember what you did don't

977
00:31:29,269 --> 00:31:32,480
kill a plant again I don't know that's

978
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:34,490
how I see it's only don't freak out

979
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,808
about stuff I've been at this a long

980
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:37,159
time and I've dealt with a lot of

981
00:31:35,808 --> 00:31:38,298
mistakes and a lot of problems and I

982
00:31:37,159 --> 00:31:40,309
know that I'm prepared to deal with

983
00:31:38,298 --> 00:31:42,259
almost anything you can throw at me in a

984
00:31:40,308 --> 00:31:45,500
grow room and if I haven't dealt with it

985
00:31:42,259 --> 00:31:46,940
yet I'm ready to learn so that's how I

986
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:48,740
don't freak out but I just stay

987
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:51,169
confident and know that I got this [ __ ]

988
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:52,788
that's life just how it goes

989
00:31:51,169 --> 00:31:55,399
plants are gonna die reservoirs are

990
00:31:52,788 --> 00:31:57,200
gonna overflow things are gonna happen

991

992
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:01,069
just completely fall I've seen tables

993

994
00:32:01,069 --> 00:32:03,349
confident that I can deal with it when

995
00:32:02,839 --> 00:32:05,658
it does

996
00:32:03,349 --> 00:32:07,189
part of that is cuz I have I got a

997
00:32:05,659 --> 00:32:08,570
little bit a little bit of faith in me

998
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:10,220

999
00:32:08,569 --> 00:32:11,450

questions in that message but I've been

1004
00:32:18,109 --> 00:32:22,428
going for 33 minutes now and I feel like

1005
00:32:20,388 --> 00:32:24,138
most people only stick around for 36

1006
00:32:22,429 --> 00:32:26,690
minutes is what the statistics show when

1007
00:32:24,138 --> 00:32:28,519
I look at my uh my stats for my podcast

1008
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:30,169
looks like you guys like a 36 minute

1009
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:31,849
episode so we're getting close to that

1010
00:32:30,169 --> 00:32:34,370
which means I should start wrapping this

1011
00:32:31,849 --> 00:32:36,888
[ __ ] up so thanks everybody who listened

1012
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:38,808

1017
00:32:44,898 --> 00:32:48,319

1018
00:32:46,429 --> 00:32:49,490
find all of them it would be really cool

1019
