68
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,200
in the last episode i did mention that i

69
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,719
was experiencing a power outage the day

70
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:40,719
before and i thought it was kind of

71
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:42,878
silly that i did not talk at all about

72
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:45,439
precautions and measurements taken

73
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:46,799
during a power outage in my grow space

74
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:48,639
so that's something i want to ramble

75
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,760
about here for just a little bit

76
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:51,679
one of the first things i want to

77
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:52,959
recommend is if you think you may even

78
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,879
if you don't think you're going to

79
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,878
experience a power outage you probably

80
00:02:54,878 --> 00:02:58,639
will at some point so to prevent

81
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:00,399
problems when those power outages do

82
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:02,000
come one thing that i would highly

83
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,158
recommend for your grow and i do a lot

84
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,318
of things quite highly speaking of being

85
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:08,158
quite highly today i did take some dabs

86
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:10,000
of some lemon jeffrey concentrates made

87
00:03:08,158 --> 00:03:12,079
by a friend we can't talk too much about

88
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,919
who made it or how it got here but we

89
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,239
can talk about how much it erect me i

90
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:18,000
feel a little bit goofy a little bit off

91
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,439
in a very good way i'm not complaining

92
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,039
about it uh it feels like i got

93
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:22,800
pleasantly punched right in the face i

94
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:24,079
feel like i got a pie shoved right in my

95
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,080
face and i'm just over here dazed and

96
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,360
confused by it these lights are super

97
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,959
bright but it doesn't matter because i

98
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,799
can't pay attention to anything except

99
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,400
what's directly in front of me so the

100
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,159
camera and the screen here that's

101
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,480
basically all i can focus on thought i

102
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:38,399
should mention that anyway back to my

103
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:40,798
recommendations here i highly recommend

104
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,799
that in your grow in any grow space if

105
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,200
you anticipate or do not anticipate the

106
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:47,920
power going out i highly recommend a

107
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:49,679
timer that has a backup battery in it

108
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:51,119
that way a lot of you have that timer

109
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,799
that plugs directly into the wall then

110
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,319
you plug your light into that

111
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,159
you spin the dial and set the time

112
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:58,000
correctly and you push the up and down

113
00:03:56,158 --> 00:03:59,438
knobs to show you when you want it off

114
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,598
and on and then it just turns and the

115
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:03,680
things click accordingly goes off and on

116
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:06,318
as you set it what happens when the

117
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:09,040
power goes out if you have a timer with

118
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:10,719
a battery backup in that timer the time

119
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:13,199
keeps spinning so when the power does

120
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:15,359
come back on in your building facility

121
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:17,519
home office wherever the grow may be

122
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,280
then it gets right back on its regularly

123
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,040
scheduled program it doesn't miss any

124
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:23,198
time other than what it was out

125
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,879
naturally that you couldn't prevent

126
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,600
if you don't have that battery back up

127
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:29,839
on your timer the power in your facility

128
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,840
goes off the power to the timer goes off

129
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:34,159
and it quits turning so when it comes

130
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:35,918
back on now it is whatever time it when

131
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,560
the power went out let's just say it was

132
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:41,279
right now it's 556. it was 556 when the

133
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,439
power went off it'll be 556 for the

134
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:46,239
entire duration of your power outage

135
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:48,160
when it comes back on it's 556 again my

136
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,478
lights come on at nine and go off at

137
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,000
nine it's not going to be proper anymore

138
00:04:50,478 --> 00:04:53,758
it's gonna if my lights are off for one

139
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,839
after the power is out for an hour i'm

140
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,520
an hour off if i'm out for two hours i'm

141
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:59,198
two hours off it's not gonna be a

142
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:00,799
perfect hour duration i promise you

143
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,560
nothing in life works that way it's

144
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,759
gonna be like an hour and 47 minutes and

145
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,560
then your timers are going to be all

146
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,080
[ __ ] up some things will come back on

147
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,478
and they'll reset themselves some things

148
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:12,478
won't even come back on so to make sure

149
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:14,639
that timer comes on and stays on the

150
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:16,319
regular schedule which you had it i

151
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,879
would recommend a timer with the backup

152
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:20,879
battery especially for your lights we

153
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:22,478
need the lights to stay on a very

154
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:25,360
critical schedule let's talk a little

155
00:05:22,478 --> 00:05:27,839
bit about the lights it is okay to

156
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,600
interrupt the day cycle if your lights

157
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:31,918
are on and you need to turn them off for

158
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,680
an hour to spray maybe an hour and a

159
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:36,159
half to apply a spray application then

160
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,680
turn them back on that is okay or if the

161
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,600
power goes out for an hour and a half

162
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,600
while the lights are on that is okay

163
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,400
there won't be a problem if there are

164
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,400
interruptions in the day cycle what will

165
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:48,879
freak your plants out is if there are

166
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:51,038
interruptions within the night cycle

167
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:52,959
think about it this way you are down to

168
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:54,079
take a nap during the day most of us go

169
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:55,198
i'll take a nap during the day that's

170
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:56,959
not gonna piss me off you tell me you

171
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,478
gotta go lay down for an hour i'll take

172
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:59,758
a dab grab my phone we'll go to lay down

173
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:01,279
for an hour i don't really want to but i

174
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,520
mean we'll do it that's a good excuse

175
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:05,119
get some [ __ ] rest however if you

176
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:06,719
wake me up in the middle of the night by

177
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,038
turning some lights on and [ __ ] up my

178
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,880
sleep cycle i'm gonna be kind of annoyed

179
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:12,079
the plants have the same idea with life

180
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:14,240
you don't want to interrupt the dark

181
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:16,000
cycle but it's okay to interrupt the day

182
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,918
cycle with darkness when you interrupt

183
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,079
that nighttime cycle that's when you

184
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:22,079
really do increase the opportunity to

185
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:24,399
encourage the intersex trait that could

186
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:25,839
be in that plant so one thing i

187
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:27,758
recommend if you don't have the backup

188
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:29,758
battery timer as soon as your power does

189
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:32,479
come back on get everything back on that

190
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:34,560
regularly scheduled program as soon as

191
00:06:32,478 --> 00:06:35,839
possible sometimes the power goes out

192
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,000
when you're not home maybe you're at

193
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:39,679
work maybe you're away maybe it went off

194
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,360
and came back on and you don't even know

195
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,720
it go check all of your timers

196
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,160
occasionally just to make sure that

197
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,840
things are in sync the way that you

198
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,600
think they are this could prevent a lot

199
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:49,119
of problems when you're walking around

200
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,879
the grove looking for pests to see if

201
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,478
there's any bugs present in the room

202
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:54,319
when you're looking for other problems

203
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:56,159
just look and see are all of the timers

204
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,840
on the time which i think they are set

205
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,520
for another thing i should mention if

206
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:01,439
the power is going to be if they're

207
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:03,038
going to be working on the power let's

208
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:05,120
just say that hypothetically that the

209
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:06,560
transformer behind your house blew up

210
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,240
and it went out and then they came and

211
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,280
they got the new transformer up but

212
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,879
every couple of minutes it's like

213
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:12,799
they're plugging it in and unplugging it

214
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:14,478
and plugging it in and unplugging it

215
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,240
just [ __ ] with it to see if it works

216
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:18,079
as they hook it up there touch the wire

217
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,918
don't touch the wire the power in the

218
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:22,000
house allegedly may have been going off

219
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:25,279
and on randomly while that was happening

220
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,279
and you could hear the fans go

221
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:28,639
they would just start up and they would

222
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,840
die and you could see the light flicker

223
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,280
it would come on and as soon as it would

224
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:32,879
get to full power the lights would die

225
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:34,399
again it was happening throughout the

226
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:36,319
whole house but the main concerning part

227
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:37,839
was the grow space if you're gonna have

228
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,759
things like that happening just go

229
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:40,959
unplug all of the grow stuff just go and

230
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,800
do the lights go and do the air

231
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:44,799
conditioner it's not good for your

232
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,918
equipment or your plants to get that

233
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,439
sort of weird random schedule abuse sort

234
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:51,758
of [ __ ] just leave it dark for a little

235
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:53,519
while it's basically free it's not gonna

236
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,759
cause you any problems unless you get

237
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:56,799
big humidity spikes or something but

238
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,960
you're just gonna have to deal with that

239
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,478
when the power comes back on so if it's

240
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:02,638
going crazy randomly and you're getting

241
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:04,478
power off and on a lot just go unplug it

242
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,079
so that you don't blow up any bulbs blow

243
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:08,079
up any ballasts cause any problems with

244
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:09,680
your equipment it's easier on the gear

245
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:12,240
it's easier on your plants just to go

246
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,319
unplug all your [ __ ] then put it back on

247
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,840
when everything is fixed don't undo the

248
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,960
timers leave the timers plugged in right

249
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:18,399
where they are especially if you got

250
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:20,878
timers with the backup battery they'll

251
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:22,959
be fine unplug from the from the timers

252
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,160
pull the cords out i got a big power box

253
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:26,560
i just unplugged the power box

254
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,560
everything is all undone at that point

255
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,079
um don't overload your breakers here's a

256
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,759
very important thing this is not related

257
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:33,679
to just a random power outage this is

258
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,599
related to everything uh when you're

259
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:37,359
growing don't overload the breakers

260
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,440
don't put too many amps in one breaker

261
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,599
don't do silly [ __ ] if the breaker is

262
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,760
flipping too often that's a warning if

263
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,600
you keep fixing that breaker the breaker

264
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:47,679
hopefully the breaker will burn out if

265
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,278
not the other option is that either the

266
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:52,159
outlet the plug-in which you're plugging

267
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:54,080
your overloaded device into probably a

268
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:55,679
thousand watt hps light in a bedroom or

269
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,278
two lights in a bedroom is probably what

270
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:58,639
you're trying to do you're gonna keep

271
00:08:57,278 --> 00:09:00,399
flipping that breaker hopefully the

272
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:02,399
breaker flips and burns out inside the

273
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,159
breaker box that's gonna be a big sign

274
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,080
says hey quit [ __ ] doing this your

275
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:07,439
other option is that the inlet three

276
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,440
outlet the plug-in where you plug in the

277
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,880
light that could catch on fire the other

278
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,240
options are that the wires mill and

279
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:13,838
catch on fire and cause a short

280
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,480
somewhere else in the house which could

281
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:18,320
cause another fire so don't overload

282
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,320
[ __ ] overloading things electrically

283
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,080
will definitely cause the risk of fire

284
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,399
the more electricity the more potential

285
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,560
the fire the older the house the more

286
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,240
potential for older bad wiring the more

287
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:30,559
potential for shitty breakers shitty

288
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:33,200
sockets more potential for disaster so

289
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:34,559
pay attention don't be that guy or girl

290
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,440
that burns down the house growing

291
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:39,199
cannabis please let's not be that person

292
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,560
there's already enough bad publicity

293
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,800
enough bad [ __ ] on the news about

294
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:44,958
cannabis growers let's not be those

295
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:46,799
people speaking of being those people if

296
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:48,719
you're gonna grow have a smoke alarm

297
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:50,159
have a fire extinguisher ready and

298
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,759
understand how to use them and the

299
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:53,439
battery goes out in that smoke alarm

300
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:54,799
don't just take it down it's going to

301
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,760
beep at you it's going to be so annoying

302
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:57,519
it's going to beep right in the middle

303
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:59,679
of a podcast and piss you off don't go

304
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,759
tear it off the ceiling and smash it put

305
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:04,159
a battery in it make sure it works save

306
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:06,240
your life save your family save the home

307
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:08,399
also save the neighbors save your image

308
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,399
save our reputation all right so i think

309
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,000
that's enough on catching up talking

310
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,000
about power outages i thought it was a

311
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,600
very good opportunity to talk about that

312
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,759
since the power was going out here was

313
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,278
out here for uh several hours it kind of

314
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:21,519
was kind of frustrating imagine being at

315
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:23,439
home with just no electricity felt like

316
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,039
a caveman with no power here had to grab

317
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,560
the phone plug the phone in in the car

318
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:28,480
to charge it up and just go drive around

319
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:29,759
and listen to music luckily it was a

320
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,360
beautiful night a little bit of rain

321
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:33,519
nice and cool now i'm just [ __ ]

322
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,240
rambling shout out to my friend who sent

323
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,839
me

324
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,000
the lemon jeffrey another thing i want

325
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,680
to talk about this is uh just a random

326
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,679
thing that i have observed over the past

327
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:43,199
few days i've been driving a lot uh if

328
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:44,639
you pay attention to my social media my

329
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,399
life at all if you're included you know

330
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:48,078
that i have been driving a lot

331
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,159
i've i went through an oil change in

332
00:10:48,078 --> 00:10:51,759
like four weeks so i need an oil change

333
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:53,039
already it's only been four weeks i just

334
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:54,958
remembered i needed an oil change of

335
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:56,719
blood we said that out loud something

336
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:58,559
i've noticed i've got some shoulder pain

337
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,320
i think it might be from driving because

338
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:02,159
when i go like this i can feel right

339
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,079
about here it doesn't feel so good not a

340
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:06,078
big deal it's not killing me but

341
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:08,159
um you ever notice that sometimes when

342
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:09,679
you smoke if you've got pain that

343
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:10,879
sometimes it makes the pain go away it

344
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:12,958
feels really good but have you ever

345
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:15,278
smoked and felt the pain just completely

346
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:16,958
throb or get worse uh that that's

347
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:19,519
something that i've experienced lately

348
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:20,799
uh one night i smoked a whole bunch i

349
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,639
ate a bunch of edibles and smoked the

350
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:24,159
shoulder felt great the next night took

351
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:25,360
a couple of dabs and i was like here's

352
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:27,199
where it hurts and it just started

353
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,360
throbbing right there really weird

354
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,360
experience wondered if you guys have

355
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,639
that thought i'd ramble and share also

356
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,440
another question do you guys go through

357
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:36,319
that phase where uh i do this where i

358
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,240
can

359
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,839
smoke all of the dabs on the planet and

360
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,440
eat all the edibles on the planet and

361
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,959
not get lit and then also i have some

362
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,480
days where i could take like two dabs

363
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:47,039
and i'm like i'm so ready i need to take

364
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,560
a nap just curious send me a message

365
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:51,039

368
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:57,120
can smoke all the buds all the herbs all

369
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:58,719
the flowers eat all the edibles smoke

370
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,078
all the concentrates and not get super

371
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,240
lit and then do you have other times

372
00:12:00,078 --> 00:12:03,919
where it flips we're just looking at the

373
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,839
jar will get you too high to manage your

374
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:07,039
own business let me know what you think

375
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:09,200
all right i did say i was going to

376
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:10,480
answer some emails in here i got super

377
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,320
rambly here at the start of the show

378
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,839
once again shout out to lemon jeffrey

379
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,040
all right the first email on today's

380
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,600
show comes from a friend who would

381
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:19,679
rather remain anonymous and the question

382
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,839
goes a little bit like this it says yo

383
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:23,039
ross to jeff thanks for all you do bro

384
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,880
thank you for listening and thank you

385
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:27,599
for the great question it says my

386
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:29,838
question is this why do we dry our

387
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,079
plants upside down is this just for

388
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,839
convenience or is there another purpose

389
00:12:32,078 --> 00:12:36,159
it seems to me it would be easier to

390
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:38,560
trim them if they were dried upright i'd

391
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:40,719
like to remain anonymous please thanks

392
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:42,399
again thank you for the great question i

393
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,240
do feel like i've got a really good

394
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,919
solid answer for this

395
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,360
we do cut down the plants we hang them

396
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:48,879
upside down we let them hang until

397
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,959
they're dry enough to start chopping up

398
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:52,320
at that point we trim them up uh then we

399
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:55,278
get them into jars and actually start

400
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:57,519
the curing process why do we hang them

401
00:12:55,278 --> 00:13:00,399
in my opinion and my experience hanging

402
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:02,078
them first of all is the most convenient

403
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:04,078
it is really easy and it takes the least

404
00:13:02,078 --> 00:13:06,479
amount of space but also

405
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:08,879
if we were to put our buds on a shelf or

406
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,480
a rack or a table there's going to be a

407
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:13,039
bottom there's going to be a flat spot

408
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,879
on whatever we set that bud down on

409
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:16,480
a lot of people will use like a uh it's

410
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:18,399
a little drying rack it's a hanging

411
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,120
drying rod basically a weed hammock a

412
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:23,360
weed hotel if you will to dry the buds

413
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,278
in it's a mesh hanger that the plant

414
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,360
sits in those are cool because they're

415
00:13:25,278 --> 00:13:29,439
kind of bouncy but they also create a

416
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:32,079
drop flat spot on the bottom of the bud

417
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,920
that doesn't dry properly i like to hang

418
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:36,239
it because then the entire plant is

419
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:37,759
exposed to the airflow the air all

420
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,198
evenly then we're going to even dry

421
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:41,439
throughout the whole plant we don't get

422
00:13:39,198 --> 00:13:43,359
a flat spot that looks ugly we don't get

423
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,800
a bottom that's not getting dry and it

424
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,120
doesn't change the shape and appearance

425
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:49,120
of our bud so i think it is

426
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,639
not only is it really convenient it

427
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,919
makes it super easy they're just hanging

428
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,360
all up you don't need a bunch of shelf

429
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:55,278
space you can run a bunch of lines and

430
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,919
just hang them that's super convenient

431
00:13:55,278 --> 00:14:00,078
but also uh then they dry more evenly

432
00:13:57,919 --> 00:14:02,159
there's no flat spot nothing's touching

433
00:14:00,078 --> 00:14:04,799
they're suspended prevents uh the

434
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:06,719
opportunity for mold and other issues

435
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:08,879
now you did say that you would prefer to

436
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,320
dry them standing up the problem is

437
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:12,159
unless you're hanging them from the tip

438
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,199
which is a bud which is a part you don't

439
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:14,639
really want you could hang it from the

440
00:14:13,198 --> 00:14:16,240
top you could figure out how to do it

441
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,278
but if you they're going to fall over

442
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,120
they're just going to tip over unless

443
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:20,559
you hang it from the top so flip it

444
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,639
upside down it'll hang that way the

445
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:24,078
leaves will go this way um you said it

446
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,919
would probably be easier to trim i cut

447
00:14:24,078 --> 00:14:27,919
off a lot of the leaf before we even get

448
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:29,679
to that point while the plant is still

449
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:32,559
growing the day before harvest i go in

450
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:34,479
and pull off a good portion of any big

451
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:36,239
leaf any leaf with a pedial it comes off

452
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,680
at this point so those leaves aren't

453
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,000
even in the room for the dry and cure

454
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:41,838
process those are already gone so i take

455
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,799
those all off chop it upside chop it

456
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:46,399
hang it upside down a few days later

457
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:47,919
bust all the buds off of the sticks then

458
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:49,919
go cut off all the leaves then give it a

459
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:51,039
final trim then finish the final drying

460
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:52,639
cure so

461
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:55,360
we hang it upside down

462
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:57,120
because it makes it more evenly dry

463
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,278
there will be some weird

464
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,039
wives tales some hippie stories about

465
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:02,879
draining the resin from the top of the

466
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:04,240
from the bottom of the plant to the top

467
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:06,639
that doesn't have anything to do with it

468
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,799
that's all a myth that's all bro science

469
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:11,120
that is fake because if that were true

470
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:13,599
then wouldn't just all the thc come to

471
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,039
just the main the main top bud which is

472
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,480
now at the very bottom so that's not

473
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:20,000
real it is because it dries more evenly

474
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,159
that is why all right great question

475
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,839
thank you for that i do look forward to

476
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:25,360
follow-up questions there is another

477
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,440
question right here in the stack of

478
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,519
emails all right this question comes

479
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,199
from our friend frosty the plant man big

perlite but either way we're gonna

488
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,600
figure this out because it'll be similar

489
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,680
answers so they're using a 70 30 mix

490
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,159
which is great it says i see loads of

491
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:58,399
different approaches with a once a day

492
00:15:56,159 --> 00:16:00,000
once every other day or multiple times a

493
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:02,320
day is there a correct method to

494
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
watering cocoa also on the multiple

495
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,839
feeds would you look at getting runoff

496
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,320
every feeding the quick answer that is

497
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:10,079
yes i want runoff on every single

498
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,879
feeding when it comes to cocoa i want 10

499
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:15,198
to 20 runoff if not maybe even a little

500
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:16,879
bit more depending on how often and the

501
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:18,958
size of the pots and more things but yes

502
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:21,679
i do want runoff every time so let's

503
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:23,838
talk a little bit about feeding in cocoa

504
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:25,838
you're using cocoa you got a 70 30 base

505
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:27,600
which is great that's what i recommend i

506
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:29,040
don't know what size pots you're using i

507
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,879
don't know if you're auto watering i'm

508
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:32,480
not sure about a couple of things here

509
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:34,000
but we can dial this in and figure this

510
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,759
out you're asking about

511
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,078
how many times how often you should be

512
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:42,240
watering that really depends on the dry

513
00:16:38,078 --> 00:16:43,758
down time i would water to uh 20 runoff

514
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,120
and then if you're able to do this i

515
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:46,480
don't know how often you're there i

516
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,639
don't know your availability maybe

517
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,159
you've got a camera but this is what i

518
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,240
would do personally i would go to the

519
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:55,600
grow first thing in the morning i would

520
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:57,278
water to 20 runoff every single plant

521
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,680
then i would set a timer and then i

522
00:16:57,278 --> 00:17:01,278
would watch the plants and as soon as

523
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:03,198
one or two of the plants start showing

524
00:17:01,278 --> 00:17:05,359
me hey i'm kind of pissed off i would

525
00:17:03,198 --> 00:17:06,639
hit my timer button or make a note and i

526
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:08,399
would say the first couple of plants

527
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,079
start looking pissed off at this many

528
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,400
hours then i would start paying

529
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:14,240
attention to where the average of the

530
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,079
room looks pissed off at a certain

531
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,078
amount of hours then if you really want

532
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:19,519
to get crazy wait another hour or two

533
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:22,078
and see how long it takes for plants to

534
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:23,599
get really pissed off we're doing this

535
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:24,879
[ __ ] for science right make a note of

536
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:26,240
that so you got to know it and

537
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,919
hypothetically i'm going to make up some

538
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,798
numbers because again i'm not in your

539
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:33,120
grow

540
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:34,400
your pot size your vpd your lighting

541
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:36,000
everything in this room is going to make

542
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,440
a difference on how often you need to

543
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,558
water because it will make a difference

544
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:42,798
on how quickly or slowly your pots your

545
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:44,240
medium your containers do dry up so i'm

546
00:17:42,798 --> 00:17:46,319
going to go with six hours let's just

547
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,759
say let's just say that right at the six

548
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:49,038
hour mark it looked like the plants

549
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:51,200
would have been really happy to get

550
00:17:49,038 --> 00:17:52,960
water again the entire room so if you're

551
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,279
running multiple strains if you can dial

552
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,960
in multiple tables do that but let's

553
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:59,519
just talk about the average of the room

554
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,960
let's just say that right at six hours

555
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:03,279
all of the tables looked like it'd be

556
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,120
perfect if we water them so let's set

557
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:07,200
that timer for six hours then let's

558
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:09,279
watch again well let's time let's water

559
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,679
them then set a timer for six more hours

560
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:13,279
and watch again do they go six hours

561
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:15,038
again and need water guess what we just

562
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:17,359
learned we need to water them four times

563
00:18:15,038 --> 00:18:19,519
a day six hours apart water them to

564
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:20,879
twenty percent runoff wait six hours

565
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:23,359
water them again to twenty percent

566
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,600
runoff and continue this as the plants

567
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:27,839
grow they may need more frequent

568
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:29,918
watering or they simply may need more

569
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:31,519
water per watering that's going to be

570
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:34,160
things that you as the farmer need to

571
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:36,480
dial in i'm going to assume that when

572
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:39,279
they get larger if you're watering four

573
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,640
times a day late in veg all the way

574
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:42,480
through the end of flower you may be

575
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,880
hitting them six or eight times it just

576
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,960
depends on like i said the vpd of the

577
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,120
room the size of the container if you're

578
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,679
using four by four you're using cocoa so

579
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:53,119
if you're using a six by six pot um

580
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,480
you've got the opportunity to water

581
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:56,239
[ __ ] 20 times a day because that's

582
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,079
not going to hold much water if you're

583
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,440
using a seven gallon pot

584
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:01,279
you're only going to water two times

585
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,320
because or maybe one time

586
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:04,240
because there's gonna be a lot of

587
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:07,200
[ __ ] water in there in a commercial

588
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:09,038
grow i typically use three gallon pots

589
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,038
some people want a five gallon pot just

590
00:19:09,038 --> 00:19:13,519
because owners are owners i am a

591
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:16,079
consultant i am uh the cultivation

592
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:18,240
director uh but that doesn't mean that

593
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:20,399
the whole team follows what i say every

594
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,880
time that's i wish but humans are humans

595
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,880
and owners are owners so

596
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,559
most of the time i'm using three gallon

597
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,400
containers i prefer either a three

598
00:19:26,558 --> 00:19:30,000
gallon fabric pot if they don't want to

599
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,080
pay for the three gallon fabric pot we

600
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,240
use a three gallon grow bag that's my

601
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:37,839
favorite way to go in a commercial grow

602
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:40,640
uh with drip irrigation with one or two

603
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:43,519
water emitters per plant so i've got my

604
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:47,200
three gallons of uh amended cocoa i've

605
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:49,440
got probably 70 to 75 percent cocoa with

606
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:52,000
25 to 30 percent perlite i just like

607
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,679
that airy fluffy mix it lets me uh lets

608
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,679
me not over water is something that it

609
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:57,200
helps me do if there's too much water in

610
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:58,400
there and not enough room for air the

611
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,160
roots can't get crushed when they're

612
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,840
little as they get bigger it's not as

613
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,919
big of a deal but i like it it just does

614
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:06,000
help me out for commercial growing so i

615
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:09,679
got my three gallon container i got my

616
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:12,798
70 30 mix my 75 25-ish mix i got my two

617
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:14,720
emitters we water or i or they or it

618
00:20:12,798 --> 00:20:16,319
will get watered uh first thing in the

619
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,519
morning like i said as soon as we start

620
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:19,599
up the grow one of the first things we

621
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:20,960
do is mix up the water and hit the big

622
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:23,439
flower room so that room will get

623
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:25,600
watered first thing in the day

624
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,360
then we got there at eight sometimes it

625
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:29,678
depends on what facility

626
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:31,918
uh usually go in at eight usually leave

627
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:33,519
at six i will check the plants around

628
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:36,000
five o'clock and decide do they need

629
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:38,000
their second watering these plants get

630
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,519
big i am not exaggerating when i say

631
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,558
that in a commercial grill you guys are

632
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:42,240
going to think i'm crazy i've got

633
00:20:40,558 --> 00:20:43,839
pictures i can show you this and there

634
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,000
are people that will testify mike was

635
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:47,839
the metric guy the guy in charge of all

636
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,079
the numbers when these plants are

637
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:52,158
harvested they are wet this is their wet

638
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:54,720
weight let me say that very clearly this

639
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:57,039
is the weight of the wet plant at

640
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,519
harvest coming from a three gallon pot

641
00:20:57,038 --> 00:21:01,759
with most of the leaves defoliated the

642
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:04,720
plants would weigh somewhere between two

643
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:06,640
thousand and three thousand grams those

644
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,480
are big [ __ ] plants

645
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,200
we were growing those in three gallon

646
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:14,000
pots those would get watered at eight in

647
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,759
the morning and six pm so that's about

648
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,519
12 hours apart but we were leaving we

649
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:19,519
weren't going to be there in at 8 00 p.m

650
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:21,279
so we're going to water them at 6 00 p.m

651
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:23,679
the lights are going to go out that dark

652
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:25,119
period would buy us a couple of hours of

653
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:26,798
not watering since they aren't as

654
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:28,879
functional the heat's not as high in the

655
00:21:26,798 --> 00:21:30,639
room so we could water them at eight

656
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,480
they'd be ready for water again by about

657
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,919
six or seven we'd hit them at 5 30 or

658
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,360
six so we could clean up and go home we

659
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:37,200
want to people got to go home he can't

660
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:38,558
be there all day and it's a commercial

661
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,080
grow we got to send people home i got to

662
00:21:38,558 --> 00:21:42,240
get out there [ __ ] to do i got to go to

663
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:44,000
another girl probably so we'd water them

664
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,759
again at 6 and then we come back at

665
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,919
eight they're ready for water again so

666
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:49,440
that's a three gallon pot in most of

667
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,600
those facilities we are running

668
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,840
double-ended gavita lighting those are

669
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:56,240
they say they're 1100 watts they're 1000

670
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:58,158
watt lights but they do put out a lot of

671
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,400
heat a lot of electricity a lot of

672
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:01,760
lumens a lot of par watts whatever you

673
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,200
want to measure

674
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:05,359
those plants are really growing and

675
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,759
really cooking under those so i'm

676
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:09,279
watering twice in those if your pots are

677
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:10,558
smaller than three gallons if you've got

678
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:12,798
a one gallon pot you're looking at

679
00:22:10,558 --> 00:22:14,639
watering four to six times a day you're

680
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:16,480
not gonna have big three thousand gram

681
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,720
plants come out of that but you're still

682
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,480
gonna have to keep that medium wet so

683
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,480
um the way that i would do it i've said

684
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,480
i'm gonna recap a little bit uh the best

685
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,159
way to do this is to

686
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:29,440
turn on the water water till you get

687
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:32,080
runoff uh 20 runoff then stop watering

688
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,919
then set a timer see how long you need

689
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:35,839
to go between waterings when the plants

690
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:37,520
look like they need water again make a

691
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:40,480
note look at your timer it's been six

692
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:42,158
hours eight hours repeat that process

693
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,919
keep in mind that during the dark cycle

694
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:45,919
they may not drink as much water as they

695
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:47,280
do during the day uh you don't have as

696
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:49,360
much heat to deal with there's not as

697
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:50,639
high of a vpd they're putting out a

698
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:52,639
little bit more water they're not

699
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,400
sucking up as much water so you may not

700
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:57,120
have to water as often during the night

701
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,960
cycle it may be wise to stick around one

702
00:22:57,119 --> 00:23:02,079
night and just stick your finger in some

703
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:04,240
pots and pick up some pots check out uh

704
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:05,599
water tech one through five also that's

705
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:08,079
a really good episode if you're growing

706
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:09,599
in cocoa water tech one through five is

707
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:10,960
a really good episode i can't think of

708
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:13,519
the episode number off the top of my

709
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:15,759
head if you watch the video the episode

710
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:17,279
number will pop up right here also

711
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:19,279
somebody will leave it in the comments

712
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:21,759
for you water tech one through five

713
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:23,119
really good episode will help you out um

714
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:25,119
i'll do it quickly because i'm not going

715
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:27,519
to recap the entire episode let's let's

716
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:30,879
just say that when you put your you're

717
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:33,200
using cocoa this method works for cocoa

718
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,520
for soil for soilless mix this is how i

719
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,038
teach people how to water the plants

720
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:38,319
let's just say that you fill the pot

721
00:23:37,038 --> 00:23:40,240
with cocoa

722
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:41,359
or with your mix whatever gallon let's

723
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,519
see you got a three gallon i'm gonna use

724
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:45,119
a three gallon pot for this example we

725
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:47,119
fill it with our mix and there's no

726
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:48,959
water in it and you pick it up that's a

727
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:51,119
zero you're fired if the plant ever gets

728
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,200
that dry you're fired you're going home

729
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:54,959
then let's all the way water it all the

730
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:57,440
way until there's water [ __ ] pouring

731
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,880
out of that plant that's a five as heavy

732
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,440
as it gets pick it up that's what i'm

733
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:03,200
saying pick up this pot if it is [ __ ]

734
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:06,159
sopping wet with water and it's super

735
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,840
heavy remember that weight that's a five

736
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:10,559
now when it dries up a little bit and

737
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:13,038
it's more uh not soggy but just wet at

738
00:24:10,558 --> 00:24:14,960
the like ideal condition for a plant

739
00:24:13,038 --> 00:24:16,400
that's a four then it's going to dry up

740
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,480
a little bit where you're going oh we

741
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,080
might need to water this soon that's a

742
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,360
three then when you get to the two where

743
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:23,839
it's like hey bro are you gonna water

744
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:25,599
that [ __ ] plant that's a two number

745
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:26,798
one is where it's bone dry and you're

746
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:28,399
fired i'm not gonna ask you any

747
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:29,759
questions what happened to that plant go

748
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,440
home that's how it's gonna be i guess i

749
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:32,798
did ask a question ask what the [ __ ]

750
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,519
happened but i already know it got too

751
00:24:32,798 --> 00:24:37,839
dry so guess what clock out go home

752
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:39,759
update your resume so water tech one

753
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:41,678
through five number one it's bone dry

754
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:43,440
it's super light when you pick it up

755
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:44,798
number two it's got a little bit of

756
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,120
weight to it when you pick it up but the

757
00:24:44,798 --> 00:24:48,798
plant looks like it needs water number

758
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:50,079
three that's kind of the sweet spot

759
00:24:48,798 --> 00:24:51,759
that's where you're like oh we should

760
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:54,000
water it soon but if we water it now

761
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:55,919
it's too early it can wait that's number

762
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,839
three number four is like number four is

763
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:59,520
like oh it's almost over watered but

764
00:24:57,839 --> 00:25:00,879
it's just right because we just watered

765
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:03,038
it give it one hour it's gonna be

766
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,480
perfect number five it's like how much

767
00:25:03,038 --> 00:25:06,960
[ __ ] water are you gonna give that

768
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,720
plant so that's basically water tech one

769
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,759
through five you wanna hover right

770
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:14,000
around number three like a 2.5 to a 3.5

771
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:15,519
is right in the sweet spot there number

772
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,599
five the plants are struggling to get

773
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:19,759
oxygen number one the plants are

774
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:20,959
struggling to get water so stay right in

775
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:22,720
the middle there get that beautiful

776
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,798
balance that is water tech one through

777
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,640
five recapped let me get back on my

778
00:25:24,798 --> 00:25:28,558
notes here let me get myself back on

779
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,240
track i know i did get quite rambly once

780
00:25:28,558 --> 00:25:32,158
again shout out to my friend with the

781
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:35,278
lemon jeffrey concentrate that [ __ ] got

782
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:37,200
me all weird today uh help me feeding

783
00:25:35,278 --> 00:25:39,200
and coco i think i covered that people

784
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,558
different approaches once every other

785
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,720
day definitely not every other day

786
00:25:40,558 --> 00:25:45,038
unless you got big pots i think i gave

787
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:48,240
you advice on how to figure that out you

788
00:25:45,038 --> 00:25:50,558
do want runoff with every single

789
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,319
watering even if you are watering

790
00:25:50,558 --> 00:25:54,319
multiple times a day i would recommend

791
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:56,879
you do get watering or run off every

792
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:58,639
time if not the salts will build up in

793
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,960
that cocoa some things will stick in the

794
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,559
cocoa other things will not and then

795
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,000
when you go to water you think you're

796
00:26:02,558 --> 00:26:05,519
feeding one thing but you're actually

797
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,440
not because there's other [ __ ] just

798
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:09,759
sitting in the soil or in the cocoa or

799
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,200
whatever and then it will get absorbed

800
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:13,119
the next time you water you'll be

801
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,519
doubling up your ppms of something and

802
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:17,599
not even realize it there's more it does

803
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:19,519
say another question i don't mind

804
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:21,359
answering another question the first one

805
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:24,000
was free i will bill you for this one

806
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:26,079
check for an invoice it says is there a

807
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,119
reason why i can feed my cocoa with a

808
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:31,678
5.8 ph feeding to check runoff and

809
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:33,918
sometimes it'll be as low as 5.0 would

810
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:35,679
there be a reason or is something not to

811
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:37,759
worry about

812
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:39,038
this is a really good question and i

813
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:40,240
don't know if you're gonna like my

814
00:26:39,038 --> 00:26:41,759
answer

815
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,278
my answer

816
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:45,558
is if you ask me this in person if

817
00:26:43,278 --> 00:26:48,159
you're like bro why is my runoff

818
00:26:45,558 --> 00:26:50,240
5.0 and i'd say well what did you feed

819
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:52,240
it he'd say five eight and then my next

820
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:55,440
question is going to be are you growing

821
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:57,120
runoff or are you growing ganja plants

822
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,600
my next question would be how do the

823
00:26:57,119 --> 00:27:01,678
plants look like are the plants happy if

824
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:03,839
the plants look good i don't worry about

825
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:06,000
the runoff i do document the runoff but

826
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:09,038
i don't it doesn't concern me until i

827
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:12,079
see a problem with the plants

828
00:27:09,038 --> 00:27:14,240
i only use the runoff as a clue like i

829
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:16,240
said if there's a problem i don't change

830
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,159
anything based on the runoff i look at

831
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,359
the plants first here's a rant that i

832
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:21,120
don't know if i've done this on a

833
00:27:19,359 --> 00:27:23,359
podcast i don't know i know i've said

834
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:24,479
this like on uh instagram live and other

835
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:26,558
shows i don't know if i've done this

836
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,000
here maybe it's time to just do it again

837
00:27:26,558 --> 00:27:30,480
because maybe you don't listen to every

838
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,599
episode like i think people may but i

839
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,480
feel like

840
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:36,959
the the younger generation of growers we

841
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:39,200
have a lot of great toys we've got uh

842
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,200
they have we have a lot of great

843
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,360
technology at our fingertips and it's

844
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:47,278
very affordable now so we can buy

845
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:49,439
monitors meters gauges buzzers devices

846
00:27:47,278 --> 00:27:51,599
basically we can almost make the plants

847
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:54,080
talk to us except we can't get that far

848
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:56,319
we can almost do it we can get all the

849
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:57,839
data that we need on a computer screen

850
00:27:56,319 --> 00:28:00,798
so one thing that

851
00:27:57,839 --> 00:28:01,759
uh i think we're losing track of is

852
00:28:00,798 --> 00:28:03,200
when

853
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:04,879
somebody says there's an issue with the

854
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,240
plants we go look at the computer screen

855
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:09,039
and look at the meters look at the

856
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:11,519
monitors which is cool but what about

857
00:28:09,038 --> 00:28:13,679
looking at the plants like the plants

858
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:16,000
are over there telling you

859
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:17,360
almost everything you need to know if

860
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,640
the leaves are doing this it means one

861
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:19,918
thing if the leaves are doing this it

862
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,440
means another thing if the leaves are

863
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:23,520
going like this it definitely means

864
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,120
another [ __ ] thing if they're this

865
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:27,599
color it means one thing if they're this

866
00:28:25,119 --> 00:28:30,079
color it means the other thing

867
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:32,719
we're forgetting that as humans we've

868
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:34,960
got a lot of powerful senses and we

869
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:37,600
should use those senses first to

870
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:39,440
identify what's going on with our plants

871
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:40,639
some of the best cannabis i ever smoked

872
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,600
was grown

873
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:45,200
by people that did not have fancy meters

874
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:47,359
the the most high-tech piece of [ __ ]

875
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:49,519
that those people had was probably maybe

876
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:51,199
a ph meter i don't even think they had a

877
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:52,558
timer i think there's unplugging [ __ ]

878
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,640
and plugging it back in at the right

879
00:28:52,558 --> 00:28:58,240
time every day some of the best turbine

880
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:59,600
smoke came from a very low-tech room

881
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,359
i have nothing against you guys that

882
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:03,038
have all the great gear i love all the

883
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:04,798
great gear i love it when i'm in a

884
00:29:03,038 --> 00:29:06,240
commercial grow and i'm in a meeting

885
00:29:04,798 --> 00:29:08,158
talking to management and something

886
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:10,159
dings and i look at my phone and it says

887
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:12,080
oh the co2 ran out in room b we got to

888
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:14,000
go replace the co2 and like how do you

889
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:15,519
know that i'm like well there's a sensor

890
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,519
hanging in the middle of the room it's

891
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:19,519
not detecting any co2 it's in an alert

892
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:21,119
to my phone and now i know to go

893
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:22,480
replenish the co2 in that room the

894
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:24,158
meters are great

895
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:27,038
like our friend is worried about the

896
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:28,640
runoff he knows the ph and the ec of the

897
00:29:27,038 --> 00:29:29,919
runoff of what he's feeding that's

898
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,799
[ __ ] cool

899
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:32,480
but

900
00:29:30,798 --> 00:29:34,000
did the plants tell you there's anything

901
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,159
wrong with them that's the main point of

902
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,079
my ramble here let's look back at the

903
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:39,919
plants let's go let's get away from the

904
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:41,599
computers the monitors the buzzers the

905
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:44,240
devices and the gadgets and let's get

906
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:45,918
familiar with identifying problems and

907
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:48,880
correcting things by looking at the

908
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:51,120
plants i guess what i'm trying to say is

909
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:53,039
grow from your heart a little bit let's

910
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:54,959
look at the plants first and see if we

911
00:29:53,038 --> 00:29:56,798
can figure it out then let's use the

912
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:59,600
computers the books the devices the

913
00:29:56,798 --> 00:30:01,440
internet the web pages to help us out as

914
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:03,678
a hint as a confirmation but let's go to

915
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:06,080
the plant first maybe pull out a grow

916
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:07,600
book then go to the internet then let's

917
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:09,199
start looking at all the devices and

918
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:11,119
seeing what we can do let's kind of

919
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:13,200
build a story not just ignoring the

920
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:14,879
plants and looking at all the screens i

921
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,880
love screens the more screens the

922
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:19,200
merrier my office is filled with screens

923
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:21,520
i can't get enough of them but sometimes

924
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,840
the plants are telling you everything

925
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:25,278
that they need so my main answer to this

926
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:27,278
question is

927
00:30:25,278 --> 00:30:29,679
uh if the plants don't look like they

928
00:30:27,278 --> 00:30:32,319
have a problem why are you worried about

929
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:34,880
the runoff if there is a problem message

930
00:30:32,319 --> 00:30:37,759
me back send me pictures of the plants

931
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:39,440
also send me uh details about the ph

932
00:30:37,759 --> 00:30:41,839
that went in and the ph that came out

933
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:44,320
for the last two weeks and if you can

934
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:46,720
send me details about the ec and what

935
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:48,798
went into those plants not just the ph

936
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:51,278
for the past two weeks then i will

937
00:30:48,798 --> 00:30:52,639
review that then we will do more review

938
00:30:51,278 --> 00:30:54,159
and see if we could help you out but if

939
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,759
they look good if it ain't broke don't

940
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:57,679
fix it that's what i think the bottom

941
00:30:55,759 --> 00:30:59,038
line is here dude thank you for the

942
