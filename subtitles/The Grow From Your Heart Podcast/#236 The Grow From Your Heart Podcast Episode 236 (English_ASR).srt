thanks for coming I know you've been a

90
00:03:05,438 --> 00:03:11,019
busy man so it's always good having you

91
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:12,250
it's a grower season season so you guys

92
00:03:11,019 --> 00:03:13,539
I just thrown the microphones real quick

93
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,829
we were gonna do a podcast and then

94
00:03:13,539 --> 00:03:17,408
Jesse mentioned something and I was like

95
00:03:14,829 --> 00:03:19,900
I'm gonna hit record Jesse just said if

96
00:03:17,408 --> 00:03:22,500
you were using general organics to not

97
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:25,000
adjust the pH when you're done I

98
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,829
completely agree with that then what did

99
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,030
you say to use to adjust the pH if you

100
00:03:26,829 --> 00:03:34,000
had to oh nothing I was saying that it's

101
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:36,568
built into the formula the the CA mag

102
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,688
plus or calculus that it is they have

103
00:03:36,568 --> 00:03:42,938
it's a pH buffer I'm not exactly sure on

104
00:03:40,688 --> 00:03:45,638
the entire science of it but I do know

105
00:03:42,938 --> 00:03:47,979
for a fact that uh if you try to pH it

106
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:49,689
it will mess your [ __ ] up you have some

107
00:03:47,979 --> 00:03:51,488
funky looking plants right well because

108
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:53,078
if you're using organics it's already

109
00:03:51,489 --> 00:03:54,609
it's organic and if you go and pour

110
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:56,439
acids in there that we're using I think

111
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:59,939
it's a phosphoric acid which is the pH

112
00:03:56,438 --> 00:03:59,938
down I don't remember exactly what it is

113
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:04,810
yeah it's gonna go there and spirit

114
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:06,668
destroying all of your organics and your

115
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:07,870
micro life all right well I just wanted

116
00:04:06,669 --> 00:04:09,280
to get that on recording guys since we

117
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:10,509
were talking about it sometimes the best

118
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,430
[ __ ] comes out before I turn on the

119
00:04:10,509 --> 00:04:14,048
microphone so he's filling damn I wasted

120
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:15,459
some time there so I just want to put on

121
00:04:14,049 --> 00:04:16,629
the mics and get that on there Jesse

122
00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:18,009

123
00:04:16,629 --> 00:04:20,858
coming I really appreciate having you

124
00:04:18,009 --> 00:04:22,180
bro thanks for having me all right I'm

125
00:04:20,858 --> 00:04:24,310
all choked up from some dads let's get

126
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:28,090
official I invited Jesse over to do a

127
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:30,879
podcast and my topic was our friend John

128
00:04:28,089 --> 00:04:34,658
Rossum on periscope asked if he can grow

129
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:36,939
his bag seeds the short answer is hell

130
00:04:34,658 --> 00:04:39,728
yes you can grow your bag seeds we've

131
00:04:36,939 --> 00:04:41,680
got a really long answer also one thing

132
00:04:39,728 --> 00:04:43,478
I want to mention though a lot of the

133
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,478
older cats that I try to pitch my seeds

134
00:04:43,478 --> 00:04:49,089
to are flabbergasted and blown away by

135
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:50,949
the price of a 10 pack of seeds lately a

136
00:04:49,089 --> 00:04:52,448
10 pack of seeds will go anyway depends

137
00:04:50,949 --> 00:04:53,949
on the breeder anywhere from fifty to a

138
00:04:52,449 --> 00:04:59,319
hundred bucks for a ten pack of good

139
00:04:53,949 --> 00:05:02,288
regular or feminized 180 now for a 10

140
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:03,459
pack of seeds yes okay yeah some of

141
00:05:02,288 --> 00:05:05,439
these higher known companies are

142
00:05:03,459 --> 00:05:07,598
definitely able to get more money 150 to

143
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:09,009
200 bucks for a pack of seeds a lot of

144
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:11,199
people are gonna say what the hell and

145
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:13,120
then some of these old guys they say but

146
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:15,430
dude I've got a big baggy of seeds in my

147
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,600
closet from when I used to smoke pot and

148
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:20,139
sift it out on a record

149
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:22,240
ever on an album cover those seeds are

150
00:05:20,139 --> 00:05:24,009
great I recommend you grow those but do

151
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,019
not try to sell those the reason they

152
00:05:24,009 --> 00:05:27,849
aren't sellable the reason that the

153
00:05:26,019 --> 00:05:29,919
seeds us breeders are selling and

154
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:31,900
pushing and promoting the reason they

155
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:33,310
cost more money is because we know what

156
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:34,929
the parents are we know what's gonna

157
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:37,030
come from those seeds we've done time

158
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:39,879
selecting the male and female to produce

159
00:05:37,029 --> 00:05:41,919
a seed line that has probably gone

160
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:44,230
several years in testing and development

161
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:46,930
to figure out what we want know Herms

162
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:48,640
high-quality yeah consistency is

163
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:50,800
something I really know her a lot of

164
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,360
quality good resin production good

165
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,280
flowering time there are some plants

166
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:56,350
when you get them I've worked strains

167
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:57,969
down from 90-day flowering times by

168
00:05:56,350 --> 00:06:00,910
breeding it into other things we've cut

169
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:02,800
it down by breeding several times we've

170
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:04,390
brought it to sixty days and it's still

171
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,980
pretty much the same plant all we've

172
00:06:04,389 --> 00:06:09,610
done is breed it to shorter flowering

173
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:11,379
plants to put it to the flow grow the

174
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:13,300
seeds that come from that out find the

175
00:06:11,379 --> 00:06:15,339
one that's a lot like the original male

176
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:17,680
or female whichever we were trying to do

177
00:06:15,339 --> 00:06:20,019
and then put that back to flow his flow

178
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,790
is a quick plant so we just print seems

179
00:06:20,019 --> 00:06:24,250
to flow and sped it up a little bit it

180
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:24,730
passes on traits really well - yes she

181
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,199
does

182
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:28,030
so if you guys were looking to start a

183
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:29,560
breeding project get a Colorado flow and

184
00:06:28,029 --> 00:06:31,000
play with her because that's a fun one

185
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,860
to breed with but what I'm getting at is

186
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,660
those bagged seeds that these older cats

187
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:36,490
or maybe you younger cats have the

188
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:39,070
reason those aren't marketable and

189
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:40,449
sellable is because you don't know the

190
00:06:39,069 --> 00:06:42,459
parents you don't know the genetic

191
00:06:40,449 --> 00:06:44,289
heritage of them so they are not a

192
00:06:42,459 --> 00:06:44,949
marketable seed but you can definitely

193
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:46,960
give them away

194
00:06:44,949 --> 00:06:50,050
you can definitely grow the [ __ ] out of

195
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:52,269
them grow your bag seed you can have

196
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:54,780
hermaphrodites you guys you could have a

197
00:06:52,269 --> 00:06:58,089
bunch of males you can have shitty-ass

198
00:06:54,779 --> 00:07:01,929
ragweed but you could you very well

199
00:06:58,089 --> 00:07:04,089
could have yeah I see looking good

200
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:07,230
Jesse's getting excited over here dog

201
00:07:04,089 --> 00:07:10,209
I'm stoned I can barely [ __ ] yeah

202
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:12,490
exactly the stray dog came from Cham dog

203
00:07:10,209 --> 00:07:14,259
was [ __ ] bag seed chem dog is known

204
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:15,490
as one of the strongest strains on earth

205
00:07:14,259 --> 00:07:17,289
it's been on the cover of High Times

206
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:19,600
Magazine three or four times is the

207
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:21,730
single strongest strain on earth but

208
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:24,070
also that was old back seed when stain

209
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:25,780
strains weren't you know that's a really

210
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:27,310
deep discussion yes

211
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:28,989
you know yeah we could get way into the

212
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:30,759
chemical resin just a bunch of junk

213
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:33,220
strains back then you know I mean I'm

214
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:35,199
sure there was but you know it's with

215
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:37,120
chances are if somebody grew if you

216
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,740
bought that bag of weed and it had a

217
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,319
seed and their chances are it was decent

218
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:43,269
we yeah the only thing is we don't know

219
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:44,439
what it was it was a lot of people back

220
00:07:43,269 --> 00:07:46,060
in the day don't even know what the girl

221
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:47,410
plant they got or what the buds they got

222
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:49,300
were they want to say this is like

223
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:50,980
Acapulco gold or something but it was

224
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:52,389
just whatever that dude said it was it

225
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:55,330
was before we really knew and cared a

226
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:58,300
lot about genetics yeah yeah and then

227
00:07:55,329 --> 00:08:00,699
also on things you could get you could

228
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:04,240
even get Mexican autoflowering you never

229
00:08:00,699 --> 00:08:05,860
know and some people want those Mexican

230
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,569
autoflowering plans some people would

231
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:09,040
love to have that some people people

232
00:08:07,569 --> 00:08:10,689
message me all the time asking when I'm

233
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:13,120
gonna make OTO flowers

234
00:08:10,689 --> 00:08:14,469
this wasn't that's that's my answer this

235
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,939
was never supposed to be about my brand

236
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:17,890
or my company but I read genetics will

237
00:08:15,939 --> 00:08:20,110
never make auto flowering plants I don't

238
00:08:17,889 --> 00:08:21,909
believe in the use of auto flowering I'm

239
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:25,000
actually straying far away from

240
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:27,250
feminized seeds because I like the males

241
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,490
in the population I think that we need

242
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:31,899
male plants and feminized seeds they

243
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:34,599
don't provide can't make it enough

244
00:08:31,899 --> 00:08:36,610
feminized seeds to gallery' do yeah they

245
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:38,620
want so many of them damn things so

246
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:39,908
Jesse hit the head hit that nail right

247
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:41,799
on the head when he said you could have

248
00:08:39,908 --> 00:08:45,189
the next chem dog chem dog came from

249
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:47,769
bagsied two dudes sold the guy a bag of

250
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:51,190
weed on a Grateful Dead parking lot in

251
00:08:47,769 --> 00:08:53,620
95 I think it was chem dog found seeds

252
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:55,089
in that weed and he grew that [ __ ] and

253
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:57,759
out of one of those seeds and you guys

254
00:08:55,089 --> 00:09:00,010
go google the legend of chem dog in the

255
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:01,600
13 beans if you listen to this podcast

256
00:09:00,009 --> 00:09:02,919
and you want to be deep into the

257
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,379
cannabis culture and you want to know

258
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:08,079
some heritage google chem dog in the

259
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:09,519
legend of the 13 beans and also I got to

260
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,120
give a big shout out to the Adam Dunn

261
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:15,579
show a podcast they do an entire episode

262
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:18,370
where Kim dog actually calls in and they

263
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:19,780
discuss where this dream came from a lot

264
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:22,120
of the people that were in the chain of

265
00:09:19,779 --> 00:09:23,649
that and everything and they all call

266
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:26,049
these people are on the old school

267
00:09:23,649 --> 00:09:27,519
forums if any of the listeners are forum

268
00:09:26,049 --> 00:09:28,859
junkies you know if they already know

269
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:30,210
the story

270
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:32,220
well I'm gonna write this down one day

271
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:35,250
we're gonna have to talk about og

272
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:36,810
and if OD means overgrow or not I want

273
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:40,710
to get a few older drillers on here and

274
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:42,959
see what I just said oh gee you meant

275
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:44,310
overgrowth the website overgrown calm it

276
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:46,259
was a website that we used to frequent

277
00:09:44,309 --> 00:09:47,759
and talk about drunk cannabis some cool

278
00:09:46,259 --> 00:09:50,490
was on there all the cool breeders were

279
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:52,879
on there everyone and there's uh there's

280
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:55,289
a theory that the OG Kush came from

281
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:56,909
overgrow but also people think it's the

282
00:09:55,289 --> 00:09:59,159
Original Gangster I've also heard it

283
00:09:56,909 --> 00:10:00,449
ocean grown we'll talk about that on

284
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:00,659
this show in the future we need a few

285
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:02,700
more

286
00:10:00,659 --> 00:10:04,919
oh geez on the show to come talk with us

287
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:06,180
on that alright so grow out those bags

288
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:09,209
seeds because you can have chem dog you

289
00:10:06,179 --> 00:10:11,759
guys you could also have junk you could

290
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:16,740
totally have junk there's a little pet

291
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:18,000
peeve don't sell clothes a junk yeah in

292
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:19,830
Colorado don't do that

293
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,519
yeah grow it out if you don't sell your

294
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:25,710
junky seeds from your junkie clones it's

295
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,299
really rude it is rude it's

296
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:28,800
disrespectful to your customers it's

297
00:10:27,299 --> 00:10:31,649
disrespectful to your patients it's

298
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:33,779
disrespectful to the plant itself it's

299
00:10:31,649 --> 00:10:36,269
disrespectful to the future of cannabis

300
00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:38,339
yeah if you grow a plant and you take

301
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:40,079
clones of it don't give those clones out

302
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:41,700
until you have flowered the damn plant

303
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:44,580
and you verified that it's something

304
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:46,410
worthwhile there are so many strains

305
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:49,129
available grow something worthwhile if

306
00:10:46,409 --> 00:10:51,689
it's not as a breeder it is so hard to

307
00:10:49,129 --> 00:10:53,519
breathe something and then grow 100

308
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:56,130
seeds and realize that you have just

309
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:58,409
created [ __ ] hemp I think this train

310
00:10:56,129 --> 00:11:00,330
doesn't do us any good I've got six

311
00:10:58,409 --> 00:11:02,339
thousand seeds of it and all I'm going

312
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:03,810
to do is feed them to some birds because

313
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:05,910
I don't want anybody growing this I've

314
00:11:03,809 --> 00:11:09,239
got one CrossFit there's a lemon cush

315
00:11:05,909 --> 00:11:11,100
idea and dude it grew the fattest chunky

316
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,860
ax stall estates they were bigger than

317
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:16,740
my arms they didn't have any flavor or

318
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:19,590
any resin just grew the biggest hemp

319
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:21,570
ever is terrible so if you know I have

320
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:22,500
horrible Herman problems than all my own

321
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:24,570
drives me nuts

322
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:26,429
and your breeding projects yeah oh yeah

323
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:28,710
because that's so much of its involved

324
00:11:26,429 --> 00:11:31,079
with Kim dog so yeah Kim does have a

325
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:32,100
tendency to Herman there see so you guys

326
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:34,590
got to find if you're gonna breed with

327
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:37,110
Kim dog make sure you uh bat cross or

328
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:39,120
out cross that hermie trait go find a

329
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:40,440
solid progeny to sell a progeny from

330
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,789
your F wands and/or

331
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,620
does yeah I'm just going ahead of myself

332
00:11:41,789 --> 00:11:45,569
here all right so sometimes it's hard to

333
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:48,450
guess what pollinated the seeded buds

334
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:51,330
that you've got but you know that that

335
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:53,310
female makes quality medicine so maybe

336
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:55,350
the donor was a male in the room maybe

337
00:11:53,309 --> 00:11:57,179
something harmed but it's probably just

338
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:58,529
a stress seed it's usually a light leak

339
00:11:57,179 --> 00:12:01,109
or something like that is what's causing

340
00:11:58,529 --> 00:12:02,459
these bags seeing a lot of overdue

341
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:04,980
regular watering

342
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:06,480
yes surprises surprises on the plants

343
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:07,740
definitely if you get them too hot and

344
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,889
let them get too dry they'll start

345
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:12,720
throwing out seeds a seed is the plant's

346
00:12:10,889 --> 00:12:15,269
response of oh [ __ ]

347
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,670
the plant goes you know what I think I'm

348
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:20,129
gonna die here soon and it's only only

349
00:12:17,669 --> 00:12:23,309
it's like a horny person it just wants

350
00:12:20,129 --> 00:12:25,350
to reproduce that's the plan yeah just

351
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:26,579
to reproduce the resin is there to

352
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:28,230
protect the plant so that it can

353
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:30,600
reproduce the pistils which everybody

354
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:32,009
calls hairs those are there to collect

355
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,990
pollen so that it can reproduce

356
00:12:32,009 --> 00:12:36,360
everything is all about these plants

357
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:39,740
reproducing so if you piss off a plant

358
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:41,700
it will try to make a seed as a reaction

359
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:42,899
it just wants to make sure that it

360
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:45,240
continues it doesn't want to be wiped

361
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:47,340
out the main job in life yeah that is

362
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:49,470
its job that's its purpose is to

363
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:51,990
reproduce and continue tricking it in

364
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:55,290
many ways so be respectful

365
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:58,049
yeah I think I had a list of which

366
00:12:55,289 --> 00:13:00,419
strains were they are Gorilla Glue

367
00:12:58,049 --> 00:13:03,240
number four and seven all the Gorilla

368
00:13:00,419 --> 00:13:05,219
Glue strains were actually bagsied

369
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:07,019
accidental paulo nations that created

370
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:09,870
seeds that Josey Wales shout-out to

371
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:12,449
Josey Wales a grower slash breeder or

372
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:14,039
good accident

373
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:17,490
we're glad that happened thanks for

374
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:20,099
popping those beans golden goat one of

375
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:22,200
Colorado's most popular strains ever one

376
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:24,120
of my most popular strains for my

377
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,259
growing my photography you guys a lot of

378
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:27,330
people give me credit for breeding

379
00:13:25,259 --> 00:13:29,549
golden goat I'm gonna say right now I

380
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:31,680
did not breed the golden go golden goat

381
00:13:29,549 --> 00:13:34,319
was bred by a guy known as mr. dank in

382
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:37,919
Topeka Kansas yep and it was an accident

383
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:39,830
that was not meant to happen Jesse's

384
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:43,860
headphones are cutting out here I do my

385
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:45,300
cool I got you all right guys I think

386
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:46,649
we're back I think we recorded all the

387
00:13:45,299 --> 00:13:49,829
first part - I'm pretty sure we're using

388
00:13:46,649 --> 00:13:51,269
the zoom h6 handy recorder today and I'm

389
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:54,330
pretty sure I recorded that first part

390
00:13:51,269 --> 00:13:57,509
so better take a quick break

391
00:13:54,330 --> 00:14:00,360
livewire solutions a chayo for 4-channel

392
00:13:57,509 --> 00:14:01,919
stereo headphone amplifier it's gonna

393
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:04,590
get a hammer put to it pretty soon here

394
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:06,149
because it just pisses me off though I

395
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:08,519
think we're on golden goat

396
00:14:06,149 --> 00:14:10,889
I was saying that I did not breed the

397
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:13,350
golden go right that was mr. ding mr.

398
00:14:10,889 --> 00:14:15,720
dink Redman Kansas of all places I did

399
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:17,340
however get a clone of it and I thought

400
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:19,259
when I first started breeding I thought

401
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:20,639
it Topeka Kansas of all damn places I

402
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:23,009
almost skipped right over that is the

403
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:25,759
that's probably the coolest town in

404
00:14:23,009 --> 00:14:27,080
Kansas I'm gonna vote for Lawrence

405
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:29,460
[Music]

406
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:31,889
things in Lawrence Kansas that I can't

407
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:34,440
even talk about my disgust he boned uh

408
00:14:31,889 --> 00:14:37,559
and that there's an army based outside

409
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:39,270
of there yeah he got t-bone there so we

410
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:42,899
ended up spending like a day and a half

411
00:14:39,269 --> 00:14:44,639
in Lawrence Kansas and it's not the

412
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:47,669
Kansas I'm used to that's the treasure

413
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:49,949
there's a club every 30 seconds yes look

414
00:14:47,669 --> 00:14:51,959
at the bar you know it's the liberal

415
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:54,450
stronghold it definitely is

416
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:56,310
kayuu Topeka is pretty close to all

417
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:58,170
right yeah whoo Topeka we went to

418
00:14:56,309 --> 00:14:59,579
Wichita we went all over the place I

419
00:14:58,169 --> 00:15:01,409
lived in Lawrence for a little while so

420
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:03,960
I had a good time there but the golden

421
00:15:01,409 --> 00:15:06,990
goat I got a hold of a clone of it um my

422
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:08,670
good friend Josh a long time ago gave me

423
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:10,889
a clone of that the Hawaiian guy I

424
00:15:08,669 --> 00:15:12,269
called the Hawaiian guy I call them

425
00:15:10,889 --> 00:15:14,939
pineapple Express is what I used to call

426
00:15:12,269 --> 00:15:16,500
him that dude in the long-ass time so

427
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:18,180
pineapple express brought me a clone of

428
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:21,659
the golden goat and when I first started

429
00:15:18,179 --> 00:15:23,339
breeding one of my ideas was I felt bad

430
00:15:21,659 --> 00:15:28,980
that in Colorado we had all of the elite

431
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:30,780
genetics and everybody and like I'm a

432
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:32,310
compassionate guy they were like how do

433
00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:33,689
I get these clones I want clones I was

434
00:15:32,309 --> 00:15:35,579
like I can't get you clones of these

435
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:37,890
elite cuts but I will make seeds of them

436
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:39,870
so my idea was to make seeds of the

437
00:15:37,889 --> 00:15:41,759
golden goat just by reversing it so I

438
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:43,980
did put seeds of the golden goat out I'm

439
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:46,259
the one that made the s-1 feminized

440
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:48,029
golden goat seeds as far as I know I'm

441
00:15:46,259 --> 00:15:50,250
the only one that has done that I put

442
00:15:48,029 --> 00:15:52,818
about 5,000 of those seeds there are the

443
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:55,369
only people that are bred with it

444
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:57,798
you and I think Scott's done something

445
00:15:55,369 --> 00:16:02,829
with it I've seen gage make one strain

446
00:15:57,798 --> 00:16:06,100
what's golden yeah and then uh Holly

447
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:11,238
[ __ ] what's this seed company named Ali

448
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:14,178
Chi no [ __ ] there's a dude out of San

449
00:16:11,239 --> 00:16:15,109
Francisco yeah Ali G her algae that's

450
00:16:14,178 --> 00:16:17,568
what it is okay

451
00:16:15,109 --> 00:16:20,989
I'm gonna have to kind of phonetically

452
00:16:17,568 --> 00:16:22,878
but he's uh he's bred a couple strains

453
00:16:20,989 --> 00:16:25,220
was going go cool it's a great it's a

454
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:27,288
great plan but it was like we're talking

455
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:27,949
about it was from a bag seed it was an

456
00:16:27,288 --> 00:16:32,208
accident

457
00:16:27,948 --> 00:16:34,818
that's a Colorado takes pretty much all

458
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:36,528
the credit for that but yeah an exam is

459
00:16:34,818 --> 00:16:39,078
definitely a local string that's partly

460
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:41,899
my fault and it's a pain in the ass to

461
00:16:39,078 --> 00:16:43,458
keep it yeah that's it's a pain in the

462
00:16:41,899 --> 00:16:45,350
ass to keep a mother you have to take

463
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:47,508
clones from that golden goat often got

464
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:50,778
one hold on to it I guarantee in a few

465
00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:52,459
more years that'll be it's a lot of

466
00:16:50,778 --> 00:16:54,649
strains are getting harder to find it's

467
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:57,108
a truly good original you know the

468
00:16:54,649 --> 00:16:59,418
old-school blueberry show yeah show me a

469
00:16:57,109 --> 00:17:06,620
good Kim for give me a p90 one clone

470
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:08,808

sharing them it's another avenue to do

490
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:49,548
that and its really if you're a total

491
00:17:45,769 --> 00:17:52,909
noob you know not to be a dick but

492
00:17:49,548 --> 00:17:56,058
that's it there are better groups to

493
00:17:52,909 --> 00:17:58,669
find this you know this group is

494
00:17:56,058 --> 00:18:01,819
comprised of growers only so you know

495
00:17:58,669 --> 00:18:04,278
that's don't be shy you guys if you yeah

496
00:18:01,819 --> 00:18:05,569

may take a little bit longer he doesn't

500
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:10,870
carry the iPhone like I do he's not

501
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:12,250
attached to it like I am but I've

502
00:18:10,869 --> 00:18:13,839
usually got the phone in my pocket when

503
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:16,630
I'm working at the spot I've got the

504
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:18,159
phone turned off because there's no

505
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:21,250
service back there anyway yeah yeah

506
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:23,320
services honey and girl rooms yeah dude

507
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:25,029
our facility is like a [ __ ] bomb

508
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:26,710
shelter I can look back there for six

509
00:18:25,029 --> 00:18:28,180
months try to turn a radio on in the

510
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:30,039
middle of it when all the lights are on

511
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:31,660
although you get kavita's I don't know

512
00:18:30,039 --> 00:18:33,670
if they still do you know we're way off

513
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:35,350
topic here but in Denver you guys this

514
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:36,640
is something that I recently heard and

515
00:18:35,349 --> 00:18:38,949
or read about and had a conversation

516
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:41,440
with multiple people about in Denver

517
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:43,269
they're driving around ok if you're

518
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,950
running old school magnetic ballasts I'm

519
00:18:43,269 --> 00:18:47,410
not sure if the new digital's will do it

520
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:49,240
but the old school magnetics if you're

521
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:52,150
running enough of those they put off an

522
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:54,130
AM frequency and if you take an AM radio

523
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:55,660
in that room you have it tuned into the

524
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:57,340
station it's working you can hear it if

525
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:59,410
you walk near those ballasts it will cut

526
00:18:57,339 --> 00:19:02,679
out and make a weird humming noise it's

527
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:05,920
at a specific frequent frequency - yeah

528
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:10,240
and it's uh I've tried it on a couple of

529
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:14,050
places I know of it makes a hum and some

530
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:16,930
some like dashes and beeps it definitely

531
00:19:14,049 --> 00:19:19,419
puts off a unique signal ok yeah the

532
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:21,850
Denver Police are using an ultra

533
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:23,560
sensitive radio pickup I'm not probably

534
00:19:21,849 --> 00:19:25,659
a strong antenna is what I guess they're

535
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:27,609
using driving around through

536
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:29,860
neighborhoods and when they get that

537
00:19:27,609 --> 00:19:32,079
they're driving back bio with infrared

538
00:19:29,859 --> 00:19:36,369
cameras and now they're checking your

539
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:37,689
lights yeah and so I'm all over well

540
00:19:36,369 --> 00:19:39,459
once they've done that they're going

541
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:40,840
back home or back to the station and

542
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:42,519
checking to see if you're a medical

543
00:19:40,839 --> 00:19:44,439
marijuana caregiver so that you've got

544
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:46,240
permission to have all these lights or

545
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,769
since in the state of Colorado we're

546
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,359
only supposed to have six plants if

547
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:51,250
you've got all that light you're

548
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:52,389
supposed to be registered as a grower if

549
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:55,690
you're not they go and knock on your

550
00:19:52,390 --> 00:20:00,550
door and ask what's going on yeah so in

551
00:19:55,690 --> 00:20:03,160
Denver be careful for the cops or for

552
00:20:00,549 --> 00:20:05,139
the guys using magnetic ballasts well

553
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:07,720
yeah come by some nanos from me or

554
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:11,190
Denver store there you go on Beech

555
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:13,950
Street yes ask for

556
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:16,440
Brandon or Cassandra Cassandra that's

557
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:18,210
the chick you'll see she's cool [ __ ] is

558
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,740
that the Denver store yeah tarah store

559
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:21,029
I've never been to the Denver store so I

560
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:22,410
may have to drop in there just go wander

561
00:20:21,029 --> 00:20:23,579
around and not even tell them who I am

562
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:25,140
and just walk around and look at the

563
00:20:23,579 --> 00:20:26,849
store I like to do that when they don't

564
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:28,259
know who I am all right so we're getting

565
00:20:26,849 --> 00:20:29,759
we're getting high and getting off-topic

566
00:20:28,259 --> 00:20:32,400
here but we've had a few dabs so that's

567
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:34,500
okay what else was I gonna say I'm gonna

568
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:37,170
be controversial here I cannot prove

569
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:40,049
this but it is my theory that the Girl

570
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:41,730
Scout cookies is probably a [ __ ] and

571
00:20:40,049 --> 00:20:42,839
it was an accident and it's bagsied I

572
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:44,849
don't think they bred that on purpose

573
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:47,129
it's bred with it

574
00:20:44,849 --> 00:20:49,109
yeah there's a reason I haven't released

575
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:51,450
any of my stuff yet unless I have very

576
00:20:49,109 --> 00:20:55,409
high standards and I haven't been able

577
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:58,200
to achieve them yet but uh Girl Scout

578
00:20:55,410 --> 00:21:00,750
cookies in my opinion as a term it does

579
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:03,480
not breach table I've crossed it too it

580
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:05,490
is really neat breeder it is a really

581
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:10,259
neat plant to breed with [ __ ] yeah but

582
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:12,029
it produces hermaphrodites I put it to

583
00:21:10,259 --> 00:21:13,230
the Grateful dog and you would not

584
00:21:12,029 --> 00:21:14,369
believe what it put out I'll show you a

585
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:16,860
little bit after we record here I've

586
00:21:14,369 --> 00:21:19,019
seen some pictures I know a couple other

587
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:22,139
people that have grown that yeah yeah no

588
00:21:19,019 --> 00:21:30,589
one's it's that's maybe not grateful dog

589
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:33,690
I'm thinking of the other one you know

590
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:35,220
after breeding with it and growing and

591
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:37,259
seeing a couple different hybrids of it

592
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:40,380
you know you can recognize it real quick

593
00:21:37,259 --> 00:21:42,779
for sure um but yeah all right so while

594
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:44,520
we're talking about herm seeds seeds

595
00:21:42,779 --> 00:21:45,690
about bagged seeds if you're gonna go

596
00:21:44,519 --> 00:21:48,029
bag seeds already said that right you

597
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:50,519
gotta be careful for hermaphrodites when

598
00:21:48,029 --> 00:21:52,220
you're drawing these bag seeds treat it

599
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:54,240
just like a normal seed during veg

600
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:55,259
you're not gonna know what the parents

601
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,880
are so you're gonna have to pay a lot of

602
00:21:55,259 --> 00:21:59,339
attention to it during flower when you

603
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:02,490
start flowering you have to look every

604
00:21:59,339 --> 00:22:04,980
single day for hermaphrodite flowers on

605
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:08,579
these plants oh yeah every day sometimes

606
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:10,289
twice a day look out for males too for

607
00:22:08,579 --> 00:22:11,849
the first three weeks look out for males

608
00:22:10,289 --> 00:22:13,500
I've had plants surprise me I thought

609
00:22:11,849 --> 00:22:14,009
they were full-on female until about day

610
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,140
20

611
00:22:14,009 --> 00:22:19,289
I mean popped open to nut sack somewhere

612
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:21,810
and I'm like oh that's got to go so look

613
00:22:19,289 --> 00:22:24,460
for male flowers hurm flowers all over

614
00:22:21,809 --> 00:22:26,168
the entire plant once or twice a day

615
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:28,720
through the entire bloom cycle you guys

616
00:22:26,169 --> 00:22:31,600
of a bag seed because it could her mouth

617
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:33,399
there it had a seed for a reason and it

618
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:35,859
could her him out in the end of week

619
00:22:33,398 --> 00:22:37,658
eight so if it does you neither need to

620
00:22:35,859 --> 00:22:39,490
be able to harvest it before it produces

621
00:22:37,659 --> 00:22:41,379
the seed or you need to get in there and

622
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:43,599
be able to tweeze out if it makes one or

623
00:22:41,378 --> 00:22:45,189
two male flowers sometimes you can pull

624
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:46,898
them out with tweezers hit the plant

625
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:48,909
sprayed the plant with a water bottle

626
00:22:46,898 --> 00:22:51,219
just missed it a little bit because this

627
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:52,929
deactivates pollen Moisture will ruin

628
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:54,038
pollen so give it a nice mist get in

629
00:22:52,929 --> 00:22:55,480
there with some tweezers and pull out

630
00:22:54,038 --> 00:22:57,638
those male flowers put them in a trash

631
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:59,649
bag throw them away I got in an argument

632
00:22:57,638 --> 00:23:03,609
with someone in facebook clan the other

633
00:22:59,648 --> 00:23:07,628
day I posted a picture of a French hemp

634
00:23:03,609 --> 00:23:09,908
plant male and he told me that that

635
00:23:07,628 --> 00:23:12,278
gross spot was ruined for life and that

636
00:23:09,909 --> 00:23:17,259
pollen doesn't die and it travels for

637
00:23:12,278 --> 00:23:19,769
hundreds of miles and and all that yeah

638
00:23:17,259 --> 00:23:22,480
yeah I think to say about that Jeff I

639
00:23:19,769 --> 00:23:23,798
just want to go to that forum or that

640
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,929
post and just troll that guy's what I

641
00:23:23,798 --> 00:23:27,460
want to do no actually pollen you can

642
00:23:25,929 --> 00:23:29,980
get rid of pollen quite easily sweep the

643
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:31,690
floor get in there with some water water

644
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:33,909
deactivates pollen egos it's all you

645
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:36,070
gotta do very fragile yes it's hard to

646
00:23:33,909 --> 00:23:38,320
store in fact it's so hard to store you

647
00:23:36,069 --> 00:23:40,990
have to keep it I keep my pollen I have

648
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:43,178
little vials of pollen that are sealed

649
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:45,159

up

689
00:25:01,788 --> 00:25:06,048
it's a high region etics at hotmail.com

690
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:06,919
I'd love to have you on the show all

691
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:07,999
right so we're talking about bagged

692
00:25:06,919 --> 00:25:09,889
seeds what else do you have to add about

693
00:25:07,999 --> 00:25:12,919
bag seed bro or were we we're a Girl

694
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:15,228
Scout cookies I was assuming alleging

695
00:25:12,919 --> 00:25:17,299
that Girl Scout cookies was probably an

696
00:25:15,229 --> 00:25:19,249
accident and came from bagsied a part of

697
00:25:17,298 --> 00:25:22,038
my theory on that is because I've heard

698
00:25:19,249 --> 00:25:23,690
so many different rumors and legends of

699
00:25:22,038 --> 00:25:26,298
how it was made and who made it

700
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:27,979
and I've never the people that are

701
00:25:26,298 --> 00:25:29,418
alleged to have made it and I've never

702
00:25:27,979 --> 00:25:32,028
said what it is and they won't

703
00:25:29,419 --> 00:25:33,829
I hear it's an F what I hear a lot I'll

704
00:25:32,028 --> 00:25:35,179
call him out they've said straight-up

705
00:25:33,828 --> 00:25:37,548
they've said two or three different

706
00:25:35,179 --> 00:25:39,169
stories so I wouldn't even believe

707
00:25:37,548 --> 00:25:40,940
anything they said at this point I've

708
00:25:39,169 --> 00:25:42,499
read at least three different stories

709
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:44,479
and high times and they all say they

710
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:46,069
came from the same people like and they

711
00:25:44,479 --> 00:25:47,450
all say no one has it and that's a bunch

712
00:25:46,069 --> 00:25:48,888
of [ __ ] it's everywhere if you don't

713

00:26:13,219 --> 00:26:17,538
if you really want something go to the

727
00:26:14,989 --> 00:26:19,429
forums that's the truth I've got two

728
00:26:17,538 --> 00:26:20,989
sources for claw two or three good

729
00:26:19,429 --> 00:26:22,548
sources for clones around here and one

730
00:26:20,989 --> 00:26:24,108
of them he gets everything from the

731
00:26:22,548 --> 00:26:25,578
forum's he's kind of a quiet guy he does

732
00:26:24,108 --> 00:26:27,558
not look like a pot grower he looks like

733
00:26:25,578 --> 00:26:29,959
he probably would work on computers or

734
00:26:27,558 --> 00:26:31,219
study law somewhere and so he shows up

735
00:26:29,959 --> 00:26:32,839
with a briefcase and opens it up and

736
00:26:31,219 --> 00:26:35,179
drops me off a few cuttings this Emmylou

737
00:26:32,838 --> 00:26:37,278
[ __ ] that he got online I love when

738
00:26:35,179 --> 00:26:38,778
clones come from him and also it seems

739
00:26:37,278 --> 00:26:40,519
like right around the same time he gets

740
00:26:38,778 --> 00:26:42,378
them either you or Spence will end up

741
00:26:40,519 --> 00:26:43,848
with the same guy and you guys will

742
00:26:42,378 --> 00:26:45,319
throw me a cut or I'll trade you a cut

743
00:26:43,848 --> 00:26:47,598
just cuz that's how our group works and

744
00:26:45,319 --> 00:26:49,878
I'll run them side-by-side and I'm

745
00:26:47,598 --> 00:26:50,909
always so amazed that everybody got the

746
00:26:49,878 --> 00:26:52,589
same cut

747
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:54,240
like how did Spence end up with this

748
00:26:52,589 --> 00:26:55,740
Girl Scout cookies and my other friend

749
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,839
ended up with the Girl Scout cookies and

750
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:59,579
I ran him and there's the same [ __ ]

751
00:26:57,839 --> 00:27:02,189
thing and they started from the same

752
00:26:59,579 --> 00:27:04,859
seed somewhere it's so amazing to me and

753
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:06,150
then I mean just seeing I mean we've all

754
00:27:04,859 --> 00:27:09,240
grown enough of it you can tell

755
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:11,040
instantly if it's it how do all these

756
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:14,789
people on the Internet have the same

757
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:17,460
freaking thing yeah it's crazy yeah

758
00:27:14,789 --> 00:27:19,710
they're getting around people are flying

759
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:20,819
they're driving they're taking a horse I

760
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:22,200
don't know what they're doing so you

761
00:27:20,819 --> 00:27:24,210
guys if you get some weed if you get

762
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:25,590
some good quality cannabis and it's got

763
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:27,059
a couple of healthy good-looking seeds

764
00:27:25,589 --> 00:27:30,209
in there and you don't have money to

765
00:27:27,059 --> 00:27:32,519
spend on some high quality seeds that we

766
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:34,710
know all the history behind them and

767
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:39,389
they were bred by magic elves in a

768
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:40,650
dungeon in Quebec but if you if you

769
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:42,030
don't want to pay good money for seeds

770
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:43,890
if you don't have access to good clones

771
00:27:42,029 --> 00:27:45,599
just throw some of those bags seeds in a

772
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:46,500
paper towel germinate them just start

773
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:48,329
them out just like you would any other

774
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:50,220
seeds and pay a lot of attention and

775
00:27:48,329 --> 00:27:52,079
then grow them out smoke it with your

776
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:55,319
friends here's something I really have

777
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:56,279
to say take a [ __ ] clone oh my god

778
00:27:55,319 --> 00:27:58,169
you guys you wouldn't believe how many

779
00:27:56,279 --> 00:27:59,399
people say look what I grew from seed no

780
00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:00,810
Mike can I get a clone of that and like

781
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,880
I didn't take any clones yeah

782
00:28:00,809 --> 00:28:04,169
dude take a clone it's not that hard you

783
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,520
take a little clone you dip it some [ __ ]

784
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:07,800
and you put in a ruder get some clones

785
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:11,609
if it hurts really bad don't take a

786
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:14,909
clone that's true it grows balls through

787
00:28:11,609 --> 00:28:16,409
months grow more seeds these bag seeds

788
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:17,910
are free he already paid 50 bucks for

789
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:19,860
that eighth or whatever you paid for it

790
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:21,779
make sure you grow the seeds that are in

791
00:28:19,859 --> 00:28:23,459
there and then you could have the next

792
00:28:21,779 --> 00:28:25,349
chem dog you could grow the next Girl

793
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:27,120
Scout cookies you could grow the next

794
00:28:25,349 --> 00:28:28,199
gorilla glue you could grow the next

795
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:37,679
golden goat

796
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:38,130
oh gee oh gee cush Tahoe what's another

797
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:41,210
one

798
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:44,460
creepy creepy he's ghost Sour Diesel

799
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:46,890
yeah yeah every single strain we were

800
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:48,779
smoking came from seed every one of them

801
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:50,460
yeah I can't think of one strain that

802
00:28:48,779 --> 00:28:53,539
didn't come from seed and if you can

803
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:53,539
I'll give you $100

804
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:57,740
because every [ __ ] cannabis plant we

805
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:00,299
were smoking came from a seed somewhere

806
00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:02,339
if you grow out that bag seed you could

807
00:29:00,298 --> 00:29:05,400
have a cup winner right there because a

808
00:29:02,339 --> 00:29:07,168
lot of times you don't even know what it

809
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,788
was bred with that's yours you don't

810
00:29:07,169 --> 00:29:10,770
have to give anybody credit that's your

811
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:13,079
seed you found that so you've got the

812
00:29:10,769 --> 00:29:14,879
that Jesse's pride and joy now and so

813
00:29:13,079 --> 00:29:17,519
when the cannabis cup winnings come up

814
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:19,169
and the winner for the most heady indica

815
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:21,750
here in Denver Colorado at the cannabis

816
00:29:19,169 --> 00:29:23,909
cup goes to Jesse for Jesse's mystery

817
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:25,769
funk and there you go man you just won

818
00:29:23,909 --> 00:29:28,320
that cannabis cup what's up AG seed that

819
00:29:25,769 --> 00:29:31,158
she found chem dog did it why couldn't

820
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:33,178
you yeah true story

821
00:29:31,159 --> 00:29:34,740
all right I've been rambling a lot I

822
00:29:33,179 --> 00:29:36,840
needed AB and then I think we're

823
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:37,890
thinking might be we would go for close

824
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:40,558
to 30 minutes here we could probably

825
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:41,880
start wrapping up this part dude all

826
00:29:40,558 --> 00:29:43,829
right guys we tried to wrap up this

827
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:45,809
episode but the conversation kept going

828
00:29:43,829 --> 00:29:48,298
so what I decided to do was to make this

829
00:29:45,808 --> 00:29:51,329
a two-part episode so I will drop

830

have any commercials for this week I

899
00:32:30,378 --> 00:32:33,228
want to get right into the episode

900
00:32:31,429 --> 00:32:35,090
before we get started I want to let you

901
00:32:33,229 --> 00:32:36,409
know that this is a part two episode a

902
00:32:35,089 --> 00:32:37,759
few days ago Jesse was here and we

903
00:32:36,409 --> 00:32:39,080
recorded for quite a while

904
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:41,929
I put up the first half of the

905
00:32:39,079 --> 00:32:44,928
conversation on Monday this is part two

906
00:32:41,929 --> 00:32:46,909
it starts off with me I asked Jesse if

907
00:32:44,929 --> 00:32:49,070
he had any guidance or advice to give

908
00:32:46,909 --> 00:32:50,989
growers and then we'll just jump into

909
00:32:49,069 --> 00:32:52,700
right where he started before we get

910
00:32:50,989 --> 00:32:56,090
there I do want to make an apology I

911
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:57,710
posted episode 92 iTunes and my website

912
00:32:56,089 --> 00:33:01,189
and stitcher and for some reason episode

913
00:32:57,710 --> 00:33:02,598
90 did not make it to stitcher I like it

914
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:04,609
normally would have that was not my

915
00:33:02,598 --> 00:33:06,858
issue it was stitchers issue they have

916
00:33:04,608 --> 00:33:09,138
since been emailed as soon as stitcher

917
00:33:06,858 --> 00:33:11,598
gets episode 90 up I will post episode

918
00:33:09,138 --> 00:33:13,459
91 I don't want to cause any confusion

919
00:33:11,598 --> 00:33:15,319
with stitcher I've emailed them and let

920
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:16,909
them know that my latest episode did not

921
00:33:15,319 --> 00:33:18,858
post I don't want to have another

922
00:33:16,909 --> 00:33:20,509
episode on to that and confuse them as

923
00:33:18,858 --> 00:33:22,908
soon as the tree gets episode 90 out

924
00:33:20,509 --> 00:33:24,288
episode 91 will be posted right after

925
00:33:22,909 --> 00:33:25,609
that I appreciate you guys for being

926
00:33:24,288 --> 00:33:27,308
patient I do apologise for any

927
00:33:25,608 --> 00:33:29,239
inconvenience that may have caused I

928
00:33:27,308 --> 00:33:30,678
feel like I've been rambling enough it's

929
00:33:29,239 --> 00:33:32,389
almost two-minute intro let's get right

930
00:33:30,679 --> 00:33:34,609
down to the part where Jesse and I are

931
00:33:32,388 --> 00:33:36,108
talking so here we go I asked Jesse I

932
00:33:34,608 --> 00:33:38,210
basically said do you have any guidance

933
00:33:36,108 --> 00:33:40,728
that you would like to share with our

934
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:43,608
listeners and then here is what Jesse

935
00:33:40,729 --> 00:33:45,619
had to say don't sell junk clones

936
00:33:43,608 --> 00:33:49,579
don't sell junk clones don't sell

937
00:33:45,618 --> 00:33:52,638
untested seeds oh my god I don't sell

938
00:33:49,579 --> 00:33:54,138
clones of plants from seed that you

939
00:33:52,638 --> 00:33:56,058
haven't even flowered yet yeah

940
00:33:54,138 --> 00:33:58,368
definitely I've heard so many horror

941
00:33:56,058 --> 00:34:01,730
stories at the gross store like I feel

942
00:33:58,368 --> 00:34:04,369
so bad for people like I can't help them

943
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:06,920
it just it really sucks if you do that

944
00:34:04,369 --> 00:34:09,259
stuff do it right if you get a bag seed

945
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:10,789
how does what's this hash this is

946
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:14,840
Startalk I'm taking the data start out

947
00:34:10,789 --> 00:34:17,029
front just give it to max if you I

948
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:21,230
wasn't even gonna say now if you get a

949
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:22,880
backseat of it okay and then oh oh if

950
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:25,280
you did if you grow some weed and it's

951
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:27,200
got a bunch of seeds in it that star dog

952
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:29,000
plant just cuz it's wholly seeded to

953
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:31,309
[ __ ] doesn't mean you can call those

954
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:34,699
seed star dog those are not star dog

955
00:34:31,309 --> 00:34:38,000
seeds those are unknown seeds unless you

956
00:34:34,699 --> 00:34:41,269
hit that star dog girl with male star

957
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,820
dog pollen or manipulated the plant in

958
00:34:41,269 --> 00:34:48,170
some other fashion to create Lou's s1

959
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:50,390
seeds it does happen you know if you

960
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:52,130
don't still not exactly it right but if

961
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:54,259
you might thing is if you don't know

962
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:56,450
what did it yeah don't call it start

963
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:57,650
yeah yeah because it could be there

964
00:34:56,449 --> 00:34:58,460
could have been some pollen in there it

965
00:34:57,650 --> 00:35:00,110
could have been another one of the

966
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:01,220
plants that firmed on it it could have

967
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:03,800
been a male in there

968
00:35:01,219 --> 00:35:05,509
if if all you had was seven star dog

969
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:07,250
plants in there I guess you do have star

970
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:08,990
dog seeds if you light stressed it and

971
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:11,260
it produced a bunch of seeds you do now

972
00:35:08,989 --> 00:35:16,089
have star dog seat it could have been a

973
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:19,430

what I mean Jessie's dad actually did

984
00:35:45,559 --> 00:35:54,860
some breeding back then so they couldn't

985
00:35:53,179 --> 00:35:56,210
run too much electricity they didn't

986
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:58,250
know what the hell they were looking for

987
00:35:56,210 --> 00:35:59,809
they had the shittiest books everything

988
00:35:58,250 --> 00:36:03,679
in the books back then was handed drawn

989
00:35:59,809 --> 00:36:05,480
people were still they were still in

990
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:08,059
electricity back then yeah and

991
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:10,349
hand-drawn books that you had to go to

992
00:36:08,059 --> 00:36:14,039
shady ass head shops to buy

993
00:36:10,349 --> 00:36:15,599

997

brought back seeds from those regions

999
00:36:23,099 --> 00:36:26,460
they grew those seeds they found that

1000
00:36:24,869 --> 00:36:28,889
somewhere too damn tall they found that

1001
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:31,260
some took way too long and they got rid

1002
00:36:28,889 --> 00:36:33,179
of them and I bet you bro I bet they're

1003

00:39:44,429 --> 00:39:48,750
represent and the dispensary that she

1087
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:50,730
represents and so I took a picture of

1088

the seedling and sent it to her and I

1089

1101
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:24,869
the near future the spot will have the

1102
00:40:23,159 --> 00:40:26,519
flowers but you guys this is a year-long

1103
00:40:24,869 --> 00:40:27,779
project don't think this something this

1104
00:40:26,519 --> 00:40:30,570
is something that's gonna hit a few

1105
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:33,480
weeks we bred a strength we bred a seed

1106
00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:35,309
line we bred three seed lines we took

1107
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:36,570
those seed lines they germinated they

1108
00:40:35,309 --> 00:40:39,000
are now in veg

1109
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:41,880
just got put into three gallon pots I've

1110
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:44,309
got a run I think twenty two of them out

1111
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:46,079
of the original I think thirty started

1112
00:40:44,309 --> 00:40:47,159
twenty two of them have made it to where

1113
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:49,889
I think they'll make it to the flour

1114
00:40:47,159 --> 00:40:52,199
room I may take water two out one's too

1115

tall and lanky it's a boy I can tell

1116
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:56,009
just by looking so I kind of want to

1117
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:57,900
just pull that one but then they'll

1118

quite seriously and this just a fee no

1126
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:17,550

the seeds to market right so two year

1128
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:21,030
project yeah exactly because I would

1129
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:23,730
want to run at least a hundred of those

1130
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:25,230
seeds myself after I ran 20 or 50 of

1131
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:26,849
them myself I would start sending 10

1132
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:32,309
packs out to friends I'd give you ten of

1133
00:41:26,849 --> 00:41:33,929
them friends that are eager to grow they

1134
00:41:32,309 --> 00:41:35,070
would grow them right away they would

1135
00:41:33,929 --> 00:41:37,259
send me pictures they would send me

1136
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:38,940
feedback if they're local I get to go I

1137
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:40,770
get to go to roster Ralph's garden and

1138
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:42,659
look at my blue heeler growing I get to

1139
00:41:40,769 --> 00:41:43,889
go to people's places and see my plants

1140
00:41:42,659 --> 00:41:47,099
growing in their garden to get feedback

1141
00:41:43,889 --> 00:41:48,449
which improves my breeding because then

1142
00:41:47,099 --> 00:41:50,279
I could say oh god I never want to breed

1143
00:41:48,449 --> 00:41:53,069
with that [ __ ] plant ever again what

1144
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:56,370
is the Blue Heeler Blue Heelers is the

1145
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:57,690
blue The Grateful dog okay shoutout to

1146

1148
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:08,100
the Grateful dog because that's a blue

1149
00:42:00,570 --> 00:42:10,050
heeler seeds for that I I don't think

1150
00:42:08,099 --> 00:42:11,759
I've ever grown a blue dream cross it's

1151
00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:15,570
about my favorite strain in the world to

1152
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:17,520
be honest that was Colorado was in love

1153
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:19,230
with blue dream and the girls in

1154
00:42:17,519 --> 00:42:21,750
California are in love with blue dream

1155
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:24,840
it's a cash crop plant it does have some

1156
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:28,070
medicinal value but it's used too much

1157
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:31,079
here as a cash crop plant for what it is

1158
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:33,450
it's uh I forgot the cross of it

1159
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:36,529
suddenly it's blueberry and Silver Haze

1160
00:42:33,449 --> 00:42:38,699
yeah yeah I guess it's by DJ shorts

1161
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:43,920
selling ourselves like that isn't it

1162
00:42:38,699 --> 00:42:45,389
yeah that's actually true because I yea

1163
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,860
that's up for debate guys if you know

1164
00:42:45,389 --> 00:42:47,670
the truth of where the blue dream came

1165
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:50,160
from

1166
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:51,869
the stories but it's a haze and it's a

1167
00:42:50,159 --> 00:42:53,460
blue dream and it's got some og I think

1168
00:42:51,869 --> 00:42:54,720
in there but you would think from what

1169
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:56,670
I've read I remember thinking that would

1170
00:42:54,719 --> 00:42:57,779
be the ideal stream but then I remember

1171
00:42:56,670 --> 00:42:59,369
getting my hands on a couple of

1172
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:01,349
different grows of it smoking it and

1173
00:42:59,369 --> 00:43:04,380
being like this is media voters of

1174
00:43:01,349 --> 00:43:05,910
amazing [ __ ] phenotype over these blue

1175
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:09,119
dream phenotype is the most impressive

1176
00:43:05,909 --> 00:43:11,368
I've seen yeah it's just a phenotype you

1177
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:12,599
guys it's labeled abd it's easy to think

1178
00:43:11,369 --> 00:43:18,269
that's just the blue dream that's

1179
00:43:12,599 --> 00:43:20,910
everywhere yeah I'm pretty sure it's the

1180
00:43:18,269 --> 00:43:23,009
one I bred - yeah but the blue dream

1181
00:43:20,909 --> 00:43:24,480
kicks out you can pull two pounds under

1182
00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:26,549
a thousand watt light and soil with that

1183
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:29,760
blue dream code using with a short short

1184
00:43:26,548 --> 00:43:31,858
veg time we did a one with a real short

1185
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:34,890
veg time last year outdoors it did like

1186
00:43:31,858 --> 00:43:37,230
three and a half pounds yeah but the

1187
00:43:34,889 --> 00:43:39,239
problem is it doesn't have an appealing

1188
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:41,190
hi to me and it doesn't make enough hash

1189
00:43:39,239 --> 00:43:43,078
to make it worth its time space energy

1190
00:43:41,190 --> 00:43:44,548
nutrients whatever else you know what I

1191
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:47,099
mean I could replace that with a Bounty

1192
00:43:44,548 --> 00:43:49,139
Killer and have way better medicine if

1193
00:43:47,099 --> 00:43:51,480
it smelled like it if it tasted like it

1194
00:43:49,139 --> 00:43:55,828
smelled you'd be the most popular strain

1195
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:58,530
in the world yeah my dog was to put that

1196
00:43:55,829 --> 00:44:00,240
resin on it and it worked it definitely

1197
00:43:58,530 --> 00:44:01,500
worked it made it i shortened the

1198
00:44:00,239 --> 00:44:03,358
flowering time it made the plants a

1199
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:05,460
little stockier and it put some resin

1200
00:44:03,358 --> 00:44:07,139
and a little bit of funk to it which is

1201
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:08,760
what oh that's all that blue dream was

1202
00:44:07,139 --> 00:44:10,078
missing was resin and funk it was

1203
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:10,559
getting too tall for the lot of indoor

1204
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:14,030
grows

1205
00:44:10,559 --> 00:44:17,040
I bet the DJ short came out of it I mean

1206
00:44:14,030 --> 00:44:20,940
it anything with his stuffs always seems

1207
00:44:17,039 --> 00:44:22,980
to be really dominant a lot you know it

1208
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:25,889
says a lot for his breeding because he's

1209
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:27,780
taken to the five before he releases his

1210
00:44:25,889 --> 00:44:31,828
packages which is pretty impressive and

1211
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:35,220
he has a style of his own I've heard him

1212
00:44:31,829 --> 00:44:38,010
argue with many people on podcasts and

1213
00:44:35,219 --> 00:44:41,789
interviews yes couple of minutes ago

1214
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:43,260
I dissed the old generation DJ shorten

1215
00:44:41,789 --> 00:44:45,119
is the old generation bro we gotta give

1216
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:46,559
him mad love oh he's one of the guys

1217
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:48,539
back in the day that was doing it right

1218
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:49,769
for genetics if it weren't for DJ sure I

1219
00:44:48,539 --> 00:44:51,539
don't think you and I would be where we

1220
00:44:49,769 --> 00:44:54,449
are in the cannabis game no I don't

1221
00:44:51,539 --> 00:44:55,509
think anyone would be I mean yeah DJ's

1222
00:44:54,449 --> 00:44:58,719
done a lot for the

1223
00:44:55,510 --> 00:45:00,400
and just everything it's I might be a

1224
00:44:58,719 --> 00:45:02,489
brick in the wall but DJ short was part

1225
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:06,070
of the foundation oh yeah

1226
00:45:02,489 --> 00:45:07,809

00:45:07,809 --> 00:45:13,329
that guys like that yeah I'll give

1229
00:45:11,469 --> 00:45:16,269
sub-cooled man credit also he's not as

1230
00:45:13,329 --> 00:45:17,889
old as sub cool or as DJ short but he's

1231
00:45:16,269 --> 00:45:20,650
in that generation between them between

1232
00:45:17,889 --> 00:45:21,940
us and DJ gotta give him mad love for

1233

1234
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:25,000
community also since we're chef first

1235
00:45:23,289 --> 00:45:27,190
readers yeah and if we're gonna go with

1236
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:31,389
old guys you guys know I'm gonna say it

1237
00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:36,070
soma deserves a high five taught me how

1238
00:45:31,389 --> 00:45:38,980
to grow on Oh G I did not know anything

1239
00:45:36,070 --> 00:45:40,630
about never I'd read so most posts but I

1240
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:42,309
never realized he was a dreadlock and I

1241
00:45:40,630 --> 00:45:44,230
never knew he was a dirty hippie and I

1242
00:45:42,309 --> 00:45:46,539
didn't know he had amethyst everywhere

1243
00:45:44,230 --> 00:45:50,380
and crystals on everything I figured he

1244
00:45:46,539 --> 00:45:53,230
was an Indian dude the country India

1245
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:56,559
yeah and my friend Donovan one day who

1246
00:45:53,230 --> 00:45:58,630
was a big user of overgrown calm

1247
00:45:56,559 --> 00:46:00,549
he was always on there one day he's like

1248
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:01,750
bro you remind me so much of so by the

1249
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:03,880
way that you talked because I was

1250
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:05,019
preaching my girl from your heart theory

1251
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:06,490
you know what I mean like doing your

1252
00:46:05,019 --> 00:46:07,690
grow room and I still think this you

1253
00:46:06,489 --> 00:46:09,849
gotta go in a grow room once in a while

1254
00:46:07,690 --> 00:46:11,380
and just sit there and just meditate and

1255
00:46:09,849 --> 00:46:12,880
just close your eyes and think about the

1256
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:15,099
goodness that those plants are gonna do

1257
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:17,019
because you're growing a plant that is

1258
00:46:15,099 --> 00:46:18,460
going to heal somebody in some sort of

1259
00:46:17,019 --> 00:46:19,929
way they're gonna feel better even if

1260
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:21,730
there are recreational smoker if they're

1261
00:46:19,929 --> 00:46:23,679
a medical smoker somebody is gonna be

1262
00:46:21,730 --> 00:46:25,030
uplifted and better because of the

1263
00:46:23,679 --> 00:46:27,190
product that you're growing and that's

1264
00:46:25,030 --> 00:46:28,810
got to feel good inside so I go in there

1265
00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:30,608
and kind of meditate a little bit on

1266
00:46:28,809 --> 00:46:32,619
that and feel that gold and we'd share

1267
00:46:30,608 --> 00:46:34,029
it the plants like me I love them and

1268
00:46:32,619 --> 00:46:41,410
then they heal somebody else and that

1269
00:46:34,030 --> 00:46:44,050
person hugs me when they see me and it

1270
00:46:41,409 --> 00:46:46,000
just perpetuates this golden cycle so I

1271
00:46:44,050 --> 00:46:47,289
was talking about that exact hippie [ __ ]

1272
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:51,130
that I just said and my buddy's like

1273
00:46:47,289 --> 00:46:53,800
dude you're like [ __ ] soma he's like

1274
00:46:51,130 --> 00:46:56,470
no go get his book his book like this

1275
00:46:53,800 --> 00:47:00,550
guy is who I was going to be in 20 years

1276
00:46:56,469 --> 00:47:02,739
if I didn't know I was already on the

1277
00:47:00,550 --> 00:47:05,380
path of being so much respect we just

1278
00:47:02,739 --> 00:47:07,339
got off on a random tangent of he didn't

1279
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:10,309
know to organic before

1280
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:15,610
Ennio y'all thought of it as cool as it

1281
00:47:10,309 --> 00:47:15,610
is no one's doing nothing new there true

1282
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:21,769
I built him out of Rubbermaid containers

1283
00:47:19,369 --> 00:47:23,420
but I used the same you know principle

1284
00:47:21,769 --> 00:47:27,500
with the drainage do you think and

1285
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:29,150
support 99% of what soma says some cool

1286
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:30,559
I love his growing style sometimes he

1287
00:47:29,150 --> 00:47:35,780
says some [ __ ] that I'm not gonna put my

1288
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:38,299
signature on yeah [ __ ] integrity he's

1289
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:40,720
met a lot of strains and he was one of

1290
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:44,690
the first people to take good pictures

1291
00:47:40,719 --> 00:47:46,669
of with a good camera buds and send him

1292

00:47:49,039 --> 00:47:56,019
without any saying that [ __ ] sub cool

1295
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:56,019
inspired 50% of my photography that's

1296
00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:07,490
was like you should check out the weed

1297
00:48:04,730 --> 00:48:09,170
nerd okay there's a lot to learn in some

1298
00:48:07,489 --> 00:48:11,299
of his older episodes if you're

1299
00:48:09,170 --> 00:48:14,440
interested in the way he does things you

1300
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:17,000
know sub cool on the YouTube the YouTube

1301
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:18,650
the weed nerds the weed nerd yeah check

1302
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:21,099
that out the older stuff is really good

1303
00:48:18,650 --> 00:48:25,280
there came a point when it got to be too

1304
00:48:21,099 --> 00:48:27,880
redundant redundant and he had yeah even

1305
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:30,200
he knows that he says it all the time

1306
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:31,519
episodes and there's only so much you

1307
00:48:30,199 --> 00:48:32,929
could talk about about cannabis you know

1308
00:48:31,519 --> 00:48:34,340
what I mean like there's always news and

1309
00:48:32,929 --> 00:48:37,069
stuff so that's why I fall to the news

1310
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:38,750
sometimes but it's going to be now that

1311
00:48:37,070 --> 00:48:40,070
once we get to episode 100 we're gonna

1312
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:41,960
go a little more in-depth I've gone

1313
00:48:40,070 --> 00:48:43,820
through the basics and now it's time to

1314
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:46,220
dig in a little bit I think our friends

1315
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:48,710
our listeners periscope I think that's a

1316
00:48:46,219 --> 00:48:50,389
really great tool for a podcast okay so

1317
00:48:48,710 --> 00:48:52,460
I've been opening periscope and doing

1318
00:48:50,389 --> 00:48:54,230
random [ __ ] on there occasionally but

1319
00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:55,699
now that we've got this good foundation

1320
00:48:54,230 --> 00:48:57,500
you guys have had your basic rudimentary

1321
00:48:55,699 --> 00:48:59,569
classes I think it's almost time around

1322
00:48:57,500 --> 00:49:01,280
episode 102 start pushing it and start

1323
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:02,600
going to the B level courses we're in a

1324
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:04,730
college level you guys here pretty soon

1325
00:49:02,599 --> 00:49:06,619
okay Sean back you'll have to get out

1326
00:49:04,730 --> 00:49:10,940
the notepad again we're gonna do real

1327
00:49:06,619 --> 00:49:12,049
ones so we're gonna wrap this part up

1328
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:14,329
we've been doing for a long time dude

1329
00:49:12,050 --> 00:49:16,490
Jesse thanks for coming man oh yeah no

1330
00:49:14,329 --> 00:49:18,319
problem oh let's see let's do outdoor

1331
00:49:16,489 --> 00:49:20,329
update real quick okay

1332
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:23,059
here lately in southern Colorado at

1333
00:49:20,329 --> 00:49:25,299
least it has been cold and humid at

1334
00:49:23,059 --> 00:49:30,320
night and hot and dry during the day

1335
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:34,280
that is a recipe for powdery mold so bud

1336
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:36,530
rot it's part of the reason Cali bud

1337
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:40,040
stands out and they get a marine layer

1338
00:49:36,530 --> 00:49:42,670
with this too but you know this year

1339
00:49:40,039 --> 00:49:45,380
I've seen some a lot of Cali style or

1340
00:49:42,670 --> 00:49:48,079
what I always call Cali style problems

1341
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:50,630
that we've never had here before so be

1342
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:52,219
prepared for that stuff how can we

1343
00:49:50,630 --> 00:49:53,809
prevent getting powdery mildew with

1344
00:49:52,219 --> 00:49:55,099
these crispy cold nights that we're

1345
00:49:53,809 --> 00:49:57,670
getting and there's a lot of moisture in

1346
00:49:55,099 --> 00:49:59,659
the air tonight yeah yeah there's I mean

1347
00:49:57,670 --> 00:50:02,300
any number of things

1348
00:49:59,659 --> 00:50:06,559
I'm personally using AK teen ovate I

1349
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:08,570
mean we're in bloom too but it's you

1350
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:10,309
know that's I see it on the cucumbers I

1351
00:50:08,570 --> 00:50:14,269
see it on the squash I see it on the

1352
00:50:10,309 --> 00:50:17,809
watermelon that's a different strain it

1353
00:50:14,269 --> 00:50:22,429
doesn't really affect cannabis from what

1354
00:50:17,809 --> 00:50:25,009
I've seen and been told but to me it's

1355
00:50:22,429 --> 00:50:28,069
an indication that the the climate for

1356
00:50:25,010 --> 00:50:31,400
to grow is oh yeah his presence yes I

1357
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:33,769
can't speak on that now but in the next

1358
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:35,450
within the next thirty days I am going

1359
00:50:33,769 --> 00:50:36,949
to become what is called applicator

1360
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:39,829

Agriculture nice my cousins oh yeah it's

1362
00:50:39,829 --> 00:50:43,730
it seems I've looked at the test it

1363
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:47,059
seems to be fairly easy it's an

1364
00:50:43,730 --> 00:50:49,730
open-book test somebody that works I'm

1365

spot dispensary and today we had our

1368
00:50:53,239 --> 00:50:57,349
first pre inspection from the Department

1369
00:50:55,670 --> 00:50:59,990
of Agriculture before we grow anything

1370
00:50:57,349 --> 00:51:02,389
in there I in our new grill areas Wow

1371
00:50:59,989 --> 00:51:05,359
dude it's I've only been out of the

1372
00:51:02,389 --> 00:51:07,609
industry for what nine months and well

1373
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:08,960
things have changed yes yes you have to

1374
00:51:07,610 --> 00:51:10,400
have a Department of Agriculture

1375
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:12,829
meetings there's about an hour and a

1376
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:15,530
half long meeting they told us basically

1377
00:51:12,829 --> 00:51:17,900
what we need to do to be compliant which

1378
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:19,700
is it's all basic stuff and it's mostly

1379
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:22,099
since the spot was designed well it's

1380
00:51:19,699 --> 00:51:24,259
the [ __ ] that we're already doing but

1381
00:51:22,099 --> 00:51:29,199
you have to have one at least one person

1382
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:31,490
on the staff that can train employees on

1383
00:51:29,199 --> 00:51:34,159
pesticide and insecticide

1384
00:51:31,489 --> 00:51:36,079
and fungicide safety good yeah and so I

1385
00:51:34,159 --> 00:51:36,529
took it upon myself to say hey I'm lead

1386

gonna pay for it of course cuz it's a

1389
00:51:40,369 --> 00:51:43,670
work-related thing and it's something

1390
00:51:41,449 --> 00:51:44,989
that I feel like I should do anyway like

1391
00:51:43,670 --> 00:51:45,950

1412
00:52:59,449 --> 00:53:04,730
that as a preventative but if you do use

1413

spraying on it just get it get a good

1417
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:20,650
one to stay away from neem oil since

00:53:18,019 --> 00:53:24,469
it's all your plant should be in bloom

1419
00:53:20,650 --> 00:53:27,650
yeah I was gifted a product called

1420
00:53:24,469 --> 00:53:30,049
stylet oil I've heard of it

1421
00:53:27,650 --> 00:53:32,570
I do the consultation and somebody an

1422
00:53:30,050 --> 00:53:34,640
older gentleman who is not as

1423
00:53:32,570 --> 00:53:36,019
able-bodied as most of us he's a little

1424
00:53:34,639 --> 00:53:37,639
he's a little slower he might call in

1425
00:53:36,019 --> 00:53:39,530
handicapped he's trying to grow his own

1426
00:53:37,639 --> 00:53:41,449
cannabis it's his first grow that's the

1427
00:53:39,530 --> 00:53:43,519
second Grove and I gave him a free

1428
00:53:41,449 --> 00:53:44,799
consultation and he had just the starts

1429
00:53:43,519 --> 00:53:47,519
of powdery mildew

1430
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:50,440
and I was like man I and he was in about

1431
00:53:47,519 --> 00:53:52,329
starting week three of flower and I like

1432
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:54,010
man I don't really want you to spray

1433
00:53:52,329 --> 00:53:56,500
anything on there but you're gonna lose

1434
00:53:54,010 --> 00:53:58,870
your crop if you don't and he said I

1435
00:53:56,500 --> 00:54:00,280
googled some stuff and they say oils and

1436
00:53:58,869 --> 00:54:03,519
things and I said don't put a neem oil

1437
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:06,420
on there I said put some worm casting

1438
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:11,349
tea on there well didn't do a damn thing

1439
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:14,139
that's most definitely preventative [ __ ]

1440
00:54:11,349 --> 00:54:15,849
so I told him I said well you're gonna

1441
00:54:14,139 --> 00:54:17,349
this crop is gonna be [ __ ] because the

1442
00:54:15,849 --> 00:54:18,670
powdery mildew was getting it wasn't

1443
00:54:17,349 --> 00:54:20,589
thick but you could see it popping up

1444
00:54:18,670 --> 00:54:22,960
into little circles ooh and so I said

1445
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:25,150
you know I've got a product called

1446
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:26,710
stylin oil that I've never used and a

1447
00:54:25,150 --> 00:54:28,869
friend of mine sent it to me to

1448
00:54:26,710 --> 00:54:30,789
encourage me to use it and he said that

1449
00:54:28,869 --> 00:54:33,549
it will destroy powdery mildew on

1450
00:54:30,789 --> 00:54:35,409
contact he says spray it on there and

1451
00:54:33,550 --> 00:54:36,970
he's an old dude I said this is your

1452
00:54:35,409 --> 00:54:39,519
medicine that you're and he said yes I

1453
00:54:36,969 --> 00:54:41,409
know I need this spray that on there he

1454
00:54:39,519 --> 00:54:43,750
knew what I was doing and it was it was

1455
00:54:41,409 --> 00:54:45,579
his decision I sprayed the stylet oil on

1456
00:54:43,750 --> 00:54:48,099
there dude that [ __ ] took down the

1457
00:54:45,579 --> 00:54:50,619
powdery mildew on contact it destroyed

1458
00:54:48,099 --> 00:54:53,019
it nice I've never actually used it I've

1459
00:54:50,619 --> 00:54:54,699
heard you can burn the [ __ ] out some

1460
00:54:53,019 --> 00:54:57,130
plants with it absolutely that's one of

1461
00:54:54,699 --> 00:54:59,049
the things a guy named I don't know if I

1462
00:54:57,130 --> 00:55:01,210
should say his real name he's known as

1463
00:54:59,050 --> 00:55:02,620
tree town is what I know him as a tree

1464
00:55:01,210 --> 00:55:03,970
town farmer he's the one that

1465
00:55:02,619 --> 00:55:06,009
recommended this to me and hooked me up

1466
00:55:03,969 --> 00:55:08,049
with it it was a vendor for the product

1467
00:55:06,010 --> 00:55:09,790
of course he's like check this out so uh

1468
00:55:08,050 --> 00:55:11,380
I didn't well I didn't have anything to

1469
00:55:09,789 --> 00:55:13,329
use it on in my grows like I didn't have

1470
00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:14,680
any mildew or anything like that so when

1471
00:55:13,329 --> 00:55:15,880
this dude was like I got powdery mildews

1472
00:55:14,679 --> 00:55:18,549
like this is what I've got to offer you

1473
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:22,180
and something about the way that it

1474
00:55:18,550 --> 00:55:24,460
coats the leaves it causes it breaks the

1475
00:55:22,179 --> 00:55:26,199
membrane of the powdery mildew and it

1476
00:55:24,460 --> 00:55:29,050
doesn't allow it to grow on your leaf is

1477
00:55:26,199 --> 00:55:30,909
basically what I read and when that [ __ ]

1478
00:55:29,050 --> 00:55:33,039
hit the leaf it just washed it right off

1479
00:55:30,909 --> 00:55:36,219
we did it with the lights off turn the

1480
00:55:33,039 --> 00:55:38,409
lights off just turn it normal as you

1481
00:55:36,219 --> 00:55:39,789
should with most pesticides actually any

1482
00:55:38,409 --> 00:55:41,859
with any spray you want the lighter are

1483
00:55:39,789 --> 00:55:43,750
a few that you actually need the lights

1484
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:45,039
on but

1485
00:55:43,750 --> 00:55:46,900
sometimes you need to heat the room

1486
00:55:45,039 --> 00:55:49,300
hopped yeah yeah that's what the deal is

1487
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:51,220
yeah need to heat the room to activate

1488
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:53,620
the oils and the plants so well we

1489
00:55:51,219 --> 00:55:56,049
sprayed it with the the the stylin oil

1490
00:55:53,619 --> 00:55:57,639
and then let it sit overnight and then

1491
00:55:56,050 --> 00:55:59,680
we went back the next morning and rinsed

1492
00:55:57,639 --> 00:56:02,469
the stylet oil off with just clean water

1493
00:55:59,679 --> 00:56:04,989
also very important yes most pesticides

1494
00:56:02,469 --> 00:56:06,879
yes you want to unclog the plants they

1495
00:56:04,989 --> 00:56:09,099
want to be able to breathe rinse that

1496
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:10,630
[ __ ] off and then dude those plants just

1497
00:56:09,099 --> 00:56:12,819
came out of it and they're amazing

1498
00:56:10,630 --> 00:56:14,559
nice yeah he got to harvest his crop

1499
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:16,120
this was several weeks ago he got to

1500
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:17,110
harvest his crop I looked at it I helped

1501
00:56:16,119 --> 00:56:19,210
him trim something I showed him how to

1502
00:56:17,110 --> 00:56:21,250
trim it no signs of powdery mildew

1503
00:56:19,210 --> 00:56:23,920
gorgeous crops smelled pretty good I

1504
00:56:21,250 --> 00:56:26,559
haven't smoked any of it so I don't know

1505
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:28,210
if it tastes like stylet oil but he's an

1506
00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:30,219
older cat he's been he's like your dad

1507
00:56:28,210 --> 00:56:33,820
you know just needs a bunch of herb to

1508
00:56:30,219 --> 00:56:36,939
smoke so he doesn't get hurt oil I think

1509
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:38,200
that's a hybrid it's in this room I

1510
00:56:36,940 --> 00:56:39,970
should have had it handy before I

1511
00:56:38,199 --> 00:56:44,079
brought it up I wasn't prepared for that

1512
00:56:39,969 --> 00:56:45,879
so fail on my part yeah I did some

1513
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:47,619
research on it once they said white it's

1514
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:49,420
not it's not colored white it's just

1515
00:56:47,619 --> 00:56:51,219
considered a white oil it's not thick

1516
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:53,470
and white or anything nice yeah when I

1517
00:56:51,219 --> 00:56:55,929
heard about it it was kind of pre Amazon

1518
00:56:53,469 --> 00:56:58,719
times I just couldn't get my hands on it

1519
00:56:55,929 --> 00:57:00,309
yeah it's it's available now and it's

1520
00:56:58,719 --> 00:57:02,529
cheap it's actually quite affordable so

1521
00:57:00,309 --> 00:57:04,090
as a preventative as an outdoor if you

1522
00:57:02,530 --> 00:57:06,220
need to rescue something it's something

1523
00:57:04,090 --> 00:57:08,829
you could look into drink here if you

1524
00:57:06,219 --> 00:57:12,219
hit it just right we'll we'll take care

1525
00:57:08,829 --> 00:57:17,529
of a light infestation but it's kind of

1526
00:57:12,219 --> 00:57:21,819
touchy to applying a foliar spray of any

1527
00:57:17,530 --> 00:57:25,360
type D leafing just removing the leaf of

1528
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:27,760
and taking it out of the area washing

1529
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:30,280
your hands don't touch them when they're

1530
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:33,010
when it's wet that's actually I've been

1531
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:36,700
told it spreads easier at that point so

1532
00:57:33,010 --> 00:57:39,790
okay that's something I've been told so

1533
00:57:36,699 --> 00:57:43,379
I would believe it I haven't been able

1534
00:57:39,789 --> 00:57:45,909
to put that to work too much but yeah

1535
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:47,410
haven't had a need to if you've got

1536
00:57:45,909 --> 00:57:48,940
powdery mildew in your grow room you've

1537
00:57:47,409 --> 00:57:50,649
got something to correct in the room

1538
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:52,329
you've got some work to do it's gonna

1539
00:57:50,650 --> 00:57:53,920
take you a little bit to fix that you

1540
00:57:52,329 --> 00:57:55,690
cannot spray away that problem

1541
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:57,970
yeah there's an environmental problem

1542
00:57:55,690 --> 00:57:59,650
gotta clean it start getting fresh air

1543
00:57:57,969 --> 00:58:01,239
out of the refresher into the room

1544
00:57:59,650 --> 00:58:04,119
stealer out of the room lower the

1545
00:58:01,239 --> 00:58:05,769
humidity but if you get it also don't

1546
00:58:04,119 --> 00:58:10,150
feel bad I mean it can even happen

1547
00:58:05,769 --> 00:58:11,469
outdoors that happens yeah yeah it

1548
00:58:10,150 --> 00:58:13,960
happened the first time I moved into a

1549
00:58:11,469 --> 00:58:15,730
new house it was August when I moved in

1550
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:20,019
so it was warm and then that first

1551
00:58:15,730 --> 00:58:22,539
winter crop I got powdery mildew it was

1552
00:58:20,019 --> 00:58:24,579
the concrete basement wall drastic

1553
00:58:22,539 --> 00:58:26,079
climate change season changes it's

1554
00:58:24,579 --> 00:58:27,400
easier to run that room in the fall

1555
00:58:26,079 --> 00:58:37,360
probably wasn't prepared for that

1556
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:40,720
yeah don't I've been told that when I

1557
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:42,700
talk about powdery mold and both of us

1558
00:58:40,719 --> 00:58:45,219
have been told that we make people feel

1559
00:58:42,699 --> 00:58:49,559
bad so don't feel bad if it happens you

1560
00:58:45,219 --> 00:58:49,559
guys person at the store told me that

1561
00:58:49,710 --> 00:58:56,949
it's because I just don't you never take

1562
00:58:54,730 --> 00:58:58,539
a picture your poops do you post the

1563
00:58:56,949 --> 00:59:00,189

1565
00:59:00,190 --> 00:59:02,889

1566
00:59:01,510 --> 00:59:04,240
for fun no it's just to show you the

1567
00:59:02,889 --> 00:59:07,629
roster Jeff [ __ ] up a fence and

1568
00:59:04,239 --> 00:59:11,039
fuck-ups recently the next time I make a

1569
00:59:07,630 --> 00:59:11,039
mistake I'll get out the camera and I'll

1570
00:59:15,389 --> 00:59:20,170
straight into the floor only a couple of

1571
00:59:18,519 --> 00:59:25,119
gallons of water but still when you hear

1572
00:59:20,170 --> 00:59:31,780
that [ __ ] overflow totally focused on

1573
00:59:25,119 --> 00:59:33,489
what I was doing and I have to take the

1574
00:59:31,780 --> 00:59:37,390
short bus to work tomorrow after this

1575
00:59:33,489 --> 00:59:39,609
[ __ ] I was with some people that uh in

1576
00:59:37,389 --> 00:59:41,829
the early days we were Phil and Reza's

1577
00:59:39,610 --> 00:59:48,760
and took off to lunch we went to the bar

1578
00:59:41,829 --> 00:59:50,949
had a couple beers came back two and a

1579
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:53,010
half hours later and water was still

1580
00:59:50,949 --> 00:59:53,009
running

1581
00:59:55,190 --> 01:00:00,530
luckily it was a big like an old

1582
00:59:58,219 --> 01:00:02,989
mechanic shop just a big steel building

1583
01:00:00,530 --> 01:00:05,300
with a roll-up door on one side this was

1584
01:00:02,989 --> 01:00:08,059
still real early days it was most

1585
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:11,600
definitely Trap House worthy but uh it

1586
01:00:08,059 --> 01:00:13,730
was a early legal Grove it was fun we

1587
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:24,889
just roll up the door and I was a blast

1588
01:00:13,730 --> 01:00:26,780
back then we had our grow and our

1589
01:00:24,889 --> 01:00:28,309
dispensary was attached they were one

1590
01:00:26,780 --> 01:00:31,550
floor was the grow one floor was the

1591
01:00:28,309 --> 01:00:32,989
dispensary and so I would be I'd have we

1592
01:00:31,550 --> 01:00:34,039
had a camera of course with the monitor

1593
01:00:32,989 --> 01:00:36,459
up there so I could just look at the

1594
01:00:34,039 --> 01:00:39,230
monitor and hear the doorbell water

1595
01:00:36,460 --> 01:00:41,329
situation smoking a fat joint just water

1596
01:00:39,230 --> 01:00:42,469
plants living my life got reggae on and

1597
01:00:41,329 --> 01:00:43,699
then you hear the doorbell and just run

1598
01:00:42,469 --> 01:00:50,379
downstairs I wouldn't even put up the

1599
01:00:43,699 --> 01:01:01,869
joint I've seen barefoot and shirtless

1600
01:00:50,380 --> 01:01:01,869
felons working in drawings and colors

1601
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:10,070
there's a barcode on any product it was

1602
01:01:08,030 --> 01:01:12,019
all just grown in someone's basement or

1603

that certain shops still just boom had

1610
01:01:24,679 --> 01:01:33,049

1613
01:01:36,050 --> 01:01:40,100
grow I worked at madam our dispensary I

1614
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:41,539
was the manager my friend Tom was the

1615
01:01:40,099 --> 01:01:42,469
owner I was the manager right underneath

1616
01:01:41,539 --> 01:01:44,059

1617
01:01:42,469 --> 01:01:45,259

01:01:47,989 --> 01:01:53,419
at this dispensary and I would grow

1621
01:01:49,639 --> 01:01:55,250
cherry widow at home in my own home Russ

1622
01:01:53,420 --> 01:01:58,039
and then I would take that cherry widow

1623
01:01:55,250 --> 01:02:00,469
to the shop and sell it to the boss for

1624
01:01:58,039 --> 01:02:02,570

today but first I want to ramble about a

1696
01:04:39,030 --> 01:04:43,290
few things that I have gotten to do this

1697
01:04:40,679 --> 01:04:45,149
past couple of weekends this episode is

1698
01:04:43,289 --> 01:04:46,710
gonna come out way after this but the

1699
01:04:45,150 --> 01:04:50,070
movie Straight Outta Compton recently

1700
01:04:46,710 --> 01:04:51,000
came out and I actually grew up in

1701
01:04:50,070 --> 01:04:52,800
Southern California

1702
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:55,710
I grew up the intersection of Bellflower

1703
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:57,780
Boulevard and Compton Boulevard so I was

1704
01:04:55,710 --> 01:05:01,260
blocks away from the actual City of

1705
01:04:57,780 --> 01:05:03,750
Compton NWA used to come do record

1706
01:05:01,260 --> 01:05:05,730
signings and appearances at a record

1707
01:05:03,750 --> 01:05:07,949
store about a block away from my house

1708
01:05:05,730 --> 01:05:11,190
so when I was like 10 years old

1709
01:05:07,949 --> 01:05:13,589
I actually met eazy-e and NWA and the

1710
01:05:11,190 --> 01:05:17,039
whole NWA crew I met Ice Cube I met

1711
01:05:13,590 --> 01:05:18,809
snoop I met MC Ren I met dr. Dre there

1712
01:05:17,039 --> 01:05:22,320
was another guy with them called himself

1713
01:05:18,809 --> 01:05:24,539
DJ speed yellow was there there were a

1714
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:26,670
few more guys there and I remember I was

1715
01:05:24,539 --> 01:05:28,608
a little kid but I do remember that ah

1716
01:05:26,670 --> 01:05:31,019
their album was huge I'd already had the

1717
01:05:28,608 --> 01:05:32,639
Straight Outta Compton CD I was singing

1718
01:05:31,019 --> 01:05:33,750
[ __ ] the police all day long I was like

1719
01:05:32,639 --> 01:05:35,400
10 years old walking around my

1720
01:05:33,750 --> 01:05:37,710
neighborhood singing [ __ ] the police and

1721
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:39,480
dope man but when they showed up to the

1722
01:05:37,710 --> 01:05:41,280
record store I remember the management

1723
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:44,490
of the record store looking pissed off

1724
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:46,230
because they were stupid hi everybody in

1725
01:05:44,489 --> 01:05:47,879
NWA showed up for that record signing

1726
01:05:46,230 --> 01:05:50,490
smelling like they just smoked a blunt

1727
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:52,349
and easy easy van so seen the movie

1728
01:05:50,489 --> 01:05:54,569
Straight Outta Compton kind of was very

1729
01:05:52,349 --> 01:05:56,069
reminiscent for me it took me back to my

1730
01:05:54,570 --> 01:05:57,470
old neighborhood in my mind it took me

1731
01:05:56,070 --> 01:05:59,450
back to those time

1732
01:05:57,469 --> 01:06:01,459
brought me back to a lot of memories it

1733
01:05:59,449 --> 01:06:03,289
was really cool to see that the movie

1734
01:06:01,460 --> 01:06:05,539
was freaking awesome it was a great

1735
01:06:03,289 --> 01:06:06,739
movie I'll give that five golden pot

1736
01:06:05,539 --> 01:06:09,500
leaves I would recommend the movie

1737
01:06:06,739 --> 01:06:11,719
Straight Outta Compton to anybody the

1738
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:13,820
guy that played the manager Paul

1739
01:06:11,719 --> 01:06:15,949
Giamatti I think his name is he did a

1740
01:06:13,820 --> 01:06:19,250
hell of a job all the actors did a great

1741
01:06:15,949 --> 01:06:21,649
job they actually used ice cubes son to

1742
01:06:19,250 --> 01:06:22,760
play cube he did a great job I think

1743
01:06:21,650 --> 01:06:24,769
everybody was perfect

1744
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:26,000
hell of a good movie I would recommend

1745
01:06:24,769 --> 01:06:28,099
you guys go see that you've probably

1746
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:31,969
already seen it by now if you haven't go

1747
01:06:28,099 --> 01:06:33,559
see it ah there's one really comedic

1748
01:06:31,969 --> 01:06:35,779
lion in the movie that made me laugh my

1749
01:06:33,559 --> 01:06:38,960
ass off that was what my best parts my

1750
01:06:35,780 --> 01:06:40,280
favorite parts of the movie that whole

1751
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:42,440
scene was actually one of my favorite

1752
01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:44,269
parts of the movie from the beginning of

1753
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:47,210
that scene until the joke that ends the

1754
01:06:44,269 --> 01:06:49,210
scene that was all my favorite parts one

1755
01:06:47,210 --> 01:06:51,889
thing I did notice I don't remember

1756
01:06:49,210 --> 01:06:53,720
which character it was but the manager

1757
01:06:51,889 --> 01:06:55,239
character Paul Giovanni's character the

1758
01:06:53,719 --> 01:06:57,469
manager he plays a guy named Jerry and

1759
01:06:55,239 --> 01:06:59,899
one of the rappers were having a private

1760
01:06:57,469 --> 01:07:02,480
conversation over a meal and they

1761
01:06:59,900 --> 01:07:04,579
completely repeated a section of

1762
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:06,710
dialogue and it seemed weird to me it

1763
01:07:04,579 --> 01:07:08,480
felt like a bad editing job being

1764
01:07:06,710 --> 01:07:10,280
somebody that edits podcast and [ __ ] I

1765
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:13,039
felt that the repetition of that

1766
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:14,210
dialogue was kind of a waste of time it

1767
01:07:13,039 --> 01:07:15,380
felt like this to me I'm gonna kind of

1768
01:07:14,210 --> 01:07:17,840
do what I felt like I saw on the show

1769
01:07:15,380 --> 01:07:19,220
like the manager said so we can't

1770
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:21,019
continue like this because we're gonna

1771
01:07:19,219 --> 01:07:22,459
go broke and the other guy replied well

1772
01:07:21,019 --> 01:07:23,869
yeah but this is how we [ __ ] live cuz

1773
01:07:22,460 --> 01:07:25,610
we're gangsters and then the manager

1774
01:07:23,869 --> 01:07:26,989
said but we can't continue to live like

1775
01:07:25,610 --> 01:07:28,070
this because we're gonna go broke and

1776
01:07:26,989 --> 01:07:29,389
the other guy said yeah but that's how

1777
01:07:28,070 --> 01:07:31,130
we live because we're [ __ ] gangsters

1778
01:07:29,389 --> 01:07:32,179
and then the movie kept going and I

1779
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:34,190
looked at my date and I was like did

1780
01:07:32,179 --> 01:07:35,569
they just repeat some [ __ ] cuz it was

1781
01:07:34,190 --> 01:07:36,920
really awkward it didn't feel right in

1782
01:07:35,570 --> 01:07:39,590
the movie but other than that that was

1783
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:41,119
the only flaw I found great movie

1784
01:07:39,590 --> 01:07:42,890
Straight Outta Compton movie gets 5

1785
01:07:41,119 --> 01:07:44,630
golden pot leaves let's move on to my

1786
01:07:42,889 --> 01:07:47,750
next little chicken scratch on this

1787
01:07:44,630 --> 01:07:50,210
paper let's see this Saturday or last

1788
01:07:47,750 --> 01:07:53,179
Saturday it would be I was invited to

1789
01:07:50,210 --> 01:07:55,190
the High Plains comedy fest in Denver

1790
01:07:53,179 --> 01:07:57,079
Colorado the High Plains comedy fest is

1791
01:07:55,190 --> 01:07:59,079
a comedy festival of course right it's

1792
01:07:57,079 --> 01:08:01,969
what it's called and they do these shows

1793
01:07:59,079 --> 01:08:03,319
throughout different clubs in the Denver

1794
01:08:01,969 --> 01:08:06,589
Colorado area so some of the

1795
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:09,320
performances were at the high dive some

1796
01:08:06,590 --> 01:08:10,760
of the performances were at mutiny some

1797
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:12,800
of the performances were at 3:00

1798
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:14,180
and then later on at night performers

1799
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:16,819
were headlining at places like the

1800
01:08:14,179 --> 01:08:19,189
Paramount Theater and Comedy Works I was

1801
01:08:16,819 --> 01:08:20,330
invited by my friend Baker what's up

1802
01:08:19,189 --> 01:08:22,608
Baker I don't know if you listen to the

1803
01:08:20,329 --> 01:08:25,759
podcast but if you do big shout out much

1804
01:08:22,609 --> 01:08:28,700
love Baker is a good friend of mine he

1805
01:08:25,759 --> 01:08:31,009
is linked up with the comedy world and

1806
01:08:28,699 --> 01:08:33,108
it is Baker's fault that I have gotten

1807
01:08:31,009 --> 01:08:34,819
to smoke weed and hash with some of my

1808
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:37,310
favorite comedians you guys I'm not

1809
01:08:34,819 --> 01:08:39,080
gonna name drop I got to smoke hash and

1810
01:08:37,310 --> 01:08:41,630
weed with a lot of my favorite comedians

1811
01:08:39,079 --> 01:08:43,430
people that you listen to people that

1812
01:08:41,630 --> 01:08:46,699
have podcasts that we listen to their

1813
01:08:43,430 --> 01:08:49,369
podcasts I was kind of blown away I was

1814
01:08:46,699 --> 01:08:51,229
standing on Broadway in Denver just

1815
01:08:49,369 --> 01:08:53,838
smoking joints and bulls with

1816
01:08:51,229 --> 01:08:55,669
world-class comedians and they were all

1817
01:08:53,838 --> 01:08:57,528
treating me like I was one of them and

1818
01:08:55,670 --> 01:08:59,239
it's mostly Baker's fault and it was

1819
01:08:57,529 --> 01:09:00,710
also because I had the good weed so big

1820
01:08:59,238 --> 01:09:02,179
shot it's my Buddy Baker big shots of

1821
01:09:00,710 --> 01:09:04,759
the High Plains Comedy Festival I had a

1822
01:09:02,180 --> 01:09:05,900
wonderful freaking time also a big shout

1823
01:09:04,759 --> 01:09:08,479
out to our friends at grassroots

1824
01:09:05,899 --> 01:09:11,088
California unfortunately the grassroots

1825
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:13,879
store had to close their doors but they

1826
01:09:11,088 --> 01:09:15,859
had a an awesome I was able to go there

1827
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:19,310
and grabbed several grassroots hats for

1828
01:09:15,859 --> 01:09:20,720
the price of two so I am styled out all

1829
01:09:19,310 --> 01:09:22,190
right I think that's enough catching up

1830
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:23,569
and humble bragging about what I've

1831
01:09:22,189 --> 01:09:24,289
gotten to do for the past couple of

1832
01:09:23,569 --> 01:09:27,140
weekends

1833
01:09:24,289 --> 01:09:28,670

1836
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:35,690
get into some of the news articles that

1837
01:09:33,439 --> 01:09:37,849
I have pulled up for you guys if you

1838
01:09:35,689 --> 01:09:41,088
have been following the show you will

1839
01:09:37,850 --> 01:09:43,759
remember that recently there was a raid

1840
01:09:41,088 --> 01:09:46,399
in California of a dispensary and when

1841
01:09:43,759 --> 01:09:48,859
the police raided this dispensary first

1842
01:09:46,399 --> 01:09:50,568
of all they treated all of the people

1843
01:09:48,859 --> 01:09:51,079
inside of the dispensary like complete

1844
01:09:50,569 --> 01:09:53,270
[ __ ]

1845
01:09:51,079 --> 01:09:56,300
they were completely disrespectful to a

1846
01:09:53,270 --> 01:09:57,950
woman in a wheelchair then they cleared

1847
01:09:56,300 --> 01:10:00,020
out the dispensary and proceeded to

1848
01:09:57,949 --> 01:10:02,449
destroy this dispensary but they did not

1849
01:10:00,020 --> 01:10:05,300
realize that they were on a hidden

1850
01:10:02,449 --> 01:10:07,189
camera as they destroyed the dispensary

1851
01:10:05,300 --> 01:10:09,470
they destroyed displays they destroyed

1852
01:10:07,189 --> 01:10:10,069
the security systems they just tore this

1853
01:10:09,470 --> 01:10:12,440
place apart

1854
01:10:10,069 --> 01:10:13,670
it was terrible as they were doing this

1855
01:10:12,439 --> 01:10:18,288
they were caught on camera

1856
01:10:13,670 --> 01:10:21,319
eating edibles from the dispensary so

1857
01:10:18,288 --> 01:10:24,590
the lawyer for the dispensary found the

1858
01:10:21,319 --> 01:10:26,149
tape edited the tape and put it it was

1859
01:10:24,590 --> 01:10:26,510
put up on YouTube it was all over the

1860
01:10:26,149 --> 01:10:29,058
Internet

1861
01:10:26,510 --> 01:10:31,190
but also they were trying to file a case

1862
01:10:29,059 --> 01:10:34,038
against the law enforcement officials

1863
01:10:31,189 --> 01:10:36,738
that were responsible for this raid and

1864
01:10:34,038 --> 01:10:39,738
for the eating of the edibles once the

1865
01:10:36,738 --> 01:10:44,178
video was introduced in a court case was

1866
01:10:39,738 --> 01:10:47,419
presented the Santa Ana police tried to

1867
01:10:44,179 --> 01:10:50,000
stop this footage from being used in a

1868
01:10:47,420 --> 01:10:52,609
raid because they were under the

1869
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:54,738
presumption of privacy since they had

1870
01:10:52,609 --> 01:10:55,969
already taken down all of the cameras in

1871
01:10:54,738 --> 01:10:57,948
this dispensary

1872
01:10:55,969 --> 01:10:59,448
so these cops came and destroyed the

1873
01:10:57,948 --> 01:11:01,219
dispensary they were caught on hidden

1874
01:10:59,448 --> 01:11:03,229
camera doing [ __ ] they should not have

1875
01:11:01,219 --> 01:11:05,599
done and then they tried to block the

1876
01:11:03,229 --> 01:11:07,759
video from being used as evidence in a

1877
01:11:05,599 --> 01:11:09,679
case against them well now I am reading

1878
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:11,900
on The Huffington Post this is an

1879
01:11:09,679 --> 01:11:14,719
article by a guy named Matt ferner and

1880
01:11:11,899 --> 01:11:16,788
the headline says judge says video

1881
01:11:14,719 --> 01:11:20,420

1882
01:11:16,788 --> 01:11:22,429
candy can be used as evidence the sub

1883
01:11:20,420 --> 01:11:24,949
headline is an internal investigation of

1884
01:11:22,429 --> 01:11:26,569
three california police officers can use

1885
01:11:24,948 --> 01:11:28,729
security camera footage from a

1886
01:11:26,569 --> 01:11:30,288
dispensary raid and i think that this is

1887
01:11:28,729 --> 01:11:32,359
great news i'm going to go ahead and

1888
01:11:30,288 --> 01:11:34,939
read the article it is from los angeles

1889
01:11:32,359 --> 01:11:36,589
and it says in Orange County Superior

1890
01:11:34,939 --> 01:11:38,118
Court judge ruled Wednesday that a

1891
01:11:36,590 --> 01:11:39,710
controversial surveillance video

1894
01:11:41,689 --> 01:11:45,979
mocking a disabled woman during am a

1895
01:11:43,399 --> 01:11:47,868
dispensary raid can be used in an

1896
01:11:45,979 --> 01:11:49,578
internal investigation by the Santa Ana

1897
01:11:47,868 --> 01:11:52,009
Police Department the unidentified

1898
01:11:49,578 --> 01:11:53,988
officers and their union the Santa Ana

1899
01:11:52,010 --> 01:11:56,090
Police Officers Association filed a

1900
01:11:53,988 --> 01:11:57,948
temporary restraining order earlier this

1901
01:11:56,090 --> 01:11:59,989
month to block the video from being used

1902
01:11:57,948 --> 01:12:02,359
in an ongoing internal investigation for

1903
01:11:59,988 --> 01:12:03,828
the officers conduct during the raid the

1904
01:12:02,359 --> 01:12:05,988
police argued their privacy was violated

1905
01:12:03,828 --> 01:12:07,969
when surveillance cameras recorded them

1906
01:12:05,988 --> 01:12:09,768
from inside sky-high holistic medical

1907
01:12:07,969 --> 01:12:12,559
marijuana dispensary after they thought

1908
01:12:09,769 --> 01:12:14,929
they had disabled all of them Superior

1909
01:12:12,559 --> 01:12:16,788
Court Judge Ronald Bauer rejected that

1910
01:12:14,929 --> 01:12:18,739
notion on Wednesday the Orange County

1911
01:12:16,788 --> 01:12:20,929
Register first reported saying that the

1912
01:12:18,738 --> 01:12:22,848
officers had no objectively reasonable

1913
01:12:20,929 --> 01:12:24,699
expectation that their actions and words

1914
01:12:22,849 --> 01:12:28,309
during the raid would not be observed

1915
01:12:24,698 --> 01:12:30,799
the officers should not expect privacy

1916
01:12:28,309 --> 01:12:32,029
on their on-duty performance of an

1917
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:34,010
official function a team

1918
01:12:32,029 --> 01:12:35,509
marijuana dispensary power rolled they

1919
01:12:34,010 --> 01:12:37,190
have made no claim that their work

1920
01:12:35,510 --> 01:12:40,400
required secrecy or that it would be

1921
01:12:37,189 --> 01:12:42,319
impeded by public view Matthew papas the

1922
01:12:40,399 --> 01:12:43,879
dispensaries attorney said the ruling is

1923
01:12:42,319 --> 01:12:45,590
a critical victory for holding police

1924
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:48,050
and public officials accountable for

1925
01:12:45,590 --> 01:12:49,670
their actions this ruling shows that the

1926
01:12:48,050 --> 01:12:51,710
court had the courage to say no to a

1927
01:12:49,670 --> 01:12:53,149
very powerful police officer union and

1928
01:12:51,710 --> 01:12:54,829
stand up for the rights of people who

1929
01:12:53,149 --> 01:12:56,960
had bad things like this happened pop

1930
01:12:54,829 --> 01:12:59,149
has told The Huffington Post pop is

1931
01:12:56,960 --> 01:13:00,680
released edited footage of the may 27th

1932
01:12:59,149 --> 01:13:03,049
raid in June that was published by

1933
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:05,210
various local news outlets the edited

1934
01:13:03,050 --> 01:13:06,289
video which can be seen on YouTube it's

1935
01:13:05,210 --> 01:13:07,430
also here in this article if you guys

1936
01:13:06,289 --> 01:13:08,479
want to see it go to The Huffington Post

1937
01:13:07,430 --> 01:13:10,850
com

1938
01:13:08,479 --> 01:13:13,459
type in let's see where will you find it

1939
01:13:10,850 --> 01:13:15,530
just type in marijuana raid and I'm sure

1940
01:13:13,460 --> 01:13:18,430
you will find this I need to find where

1941
01:13:15,529 --> 01:13:21,469
I was now here we go

1942
01:13:18,430 --> 01:13:23,000
the vetted video which can be seen shows

1943
01:13:21,470 --> 01:13:25,220
officers busting down the door and

1944
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:27,380
ordering everyone on the ground at

1945
01:13:25,220 --> 01:13:30,079
gunpoint which that's where the whole

1946
01:13:27,380 --> 01:13:32,060
comedy starts their battery using a

1947
01:13:30,079 --> 01:13:33,859
battering ram to pound in this door and

1948
01:13:32,060 --> 01:13:35,480
the funny part is that the business was

1949
01:13:33,859 --> 01:13:37,789
open all they had to do was turn the

1950
01:13:35,479 --> 01:13:39,769
handle and pull and they could have

1951
01:13:37,789 --> 01:13:41,479
gotten in very easily instead they used

1952
01:13:39,770 --> 01:13:43,880
a battering ram and pushed really hard

1953
01:13:41,479 --> 01:13:45,439
instead of just gently pulling so it

1954
01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:47,359
says the footage according to Pappas

1955
01:13:45,439 --> 01:13:49,339
shows police unsuccessfully disable it

1956
01:13:47,359 --> 01:13:50,960
disabling the shop surveillance cameras

1957
01:13:49,340 --> 01:13:53,180
which go on to record the officers

1958
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:55,609
playing darts eating something which he

1959
01:13:53,180 --> 01:13:57,829
argues is marijuana infused infused food

1960
01:13:55,609 --> 01:14:00,199
and making a joke about an amputee who

1961
01:13:57,829 --> 01:14:02,750
uses a wheelchair did you punch that

1962
01:14:00,199 --> 01:14:04,460
one-legged old benita one officer asks I

1963
01:14:02,750 --> 01:14:06,380
was about to kick her in her [ __ ] nub

1964
01:14:04,460 --> 01:14:08,689
a female officer replies to laughter

1965
01:14:06,380 --> 01:14:10,489
Corey glaive the attorney representing

1966
01:14:08,689 --> 01:14:12,500
representing the officers and their

1967
01:14:10,489 --> 01:14:14,449
union argued that the video was edited

1968
01:14:12,500 --> 01:14:16,670
to distort the officers behavior during

1969
01:14:14,449 --> 01:14:18,380
the raid he previously told the HuffPost

1970
01:14:16,670 --> 01:14:20,569
that at least one officer voluntary

1971
01:14:18,380 --> 01:14:23,329
voluntarily took and passed a drug test

1972
01:14:20,569 --> 01:14:26,539
the result of which were were provided

1973
01:14:23,329 --> 01:14:28,909
to the SAPD Pappas denied the video was

1974
01:14:26,539 --> 01:14:30,590
doctored at the full video is more than

1975
01:14:28,909 --> 01:14:32,420
12 hours long he said so he released

1976
01:14:30,590 --> 01:14:34,520
edited versions with subtitles to show

1977
01:14:32,420 --> 01:14:36,560
that what officers were allegedly saying

1978
01:14:34,520 --> 01:14:39,110
the entire video has been made available

1979
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:41,270
to the police department and that they

1980
01:14:39,109 --> 01:14:42,380
have seen the full unaltered version oh

1981
01:14:41,270 --> 01:14:44,070
and that they have seen the full

1982
01:14:42,380 --> 01:14:46,060
unaltered version Papa said

1983
01:14:44,069 --> 01:14:47,889
skyhigh holistic has filed a

1984
01:14:46,060 --> 01:14:49,570
multi-million dollar lawsuit against the

1985
01:14:47,890 --> 01:14:51,490
police department alleging that the

1986
01:14:49,569 --> 01:14:54,069
officers used excessive force during the

1987
01:14:51,489 --> 01:14:56,050
raid the dispensary is also seeking the

1988
01:14:54,069 --> 01:14:57,849
return of its property seized during the

1989
01:14:56,050 --> 01:15:00,159
raid which includes marijuana cannabis

1990
01:14:57,850 --> 01:15:02,470
infused edibles and thousands of dollars

1991
01:15:00,159 --> 01:15:04,269
in cash a hearing regarding the return

1992
01:15:02,470 --> 01:15:06,490
of the seized property is scheduled for

1993
01:15:04,270 --> 01:15:08,620
Friday glaive and SAPD

1994
01:15:06,489 --> 01:15:10,649
did not immediately respond to requests

1995
01:15:08,619 --> 01:15:12,880
for comment following the judge's ruling

1996
01:15:10,649 --> 01:15:13,539
so it looks like the ruling has been

1997
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:15,310
made

1998
01:15:13,539 --> 01:15:19,180
oh no the ruling has been made that the

1999
01:15:15,310 --> 01:15:21,039
video will be usable um I will research

2000
01:15:19,180 --> 01:15:22,960
the hearing regarding the return of the

2001
01:15:21,039 --> 01:15:26,170
seized property I'm gonna make a note of

2002
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:27,789
that sorry it takes me a minute to write

2003
01:15:26,170 --> 01:15:28,989
legibly but I'd rather take a break and

2004
01:15:27,789 --> 01:15:32,019
write it so that I remember to do it

2005
01:15:28,989 --> 01:15:34,210
alright so they will be able to use this

2006
01:15:32,020 --> 01:15:36,280
video in court which is a great thing

2007
01:15:34,210 --> 01:15:37,630
because if you were I were arrested and

2008
01:15:36,279 --> 01:15:39,939
there was a video of whatever we were

2009
01:15:37,630 --> 01:15:42,130
doing that video would be used against

2010
01:15:39,939 --> 01:15:43,689
us in court everything we say and/or do

2011
01:15:42,130 --> 01:15:45,940
will be used against us in a court of

2012
01:15:43,689 --> 01:15:47,559
law and even if we think that we have

2013
01:15:45,939 --> 01:15:49,689
some sort of assumption of privacy

2014
01:15:47,560 --> 01:15:51,250
they're not going to give us any privacy

2015
01:15:49,689 --> 01:15:54,039
this is America big brother is watching

2016
01:15:51,250 --> 01:15:55,479
you're on camera somewhere so keep that

2017
01:15:54,039 --> 01:15:57,850
in mind you guys I'm just glad that

2018
01:15:55,479 --> 01:16:00,219
they're gonna use this video because I

2019
01:15:57,850 --> 01:16:01,500
think it's [ __ ] up that these cops can

2020
01:16:00,220 --> 01:16:04,300
act like they're trying to do something

2021
01:16:01,500 --> 01:16:06,909
just and useful for us and then just go

2022
01:16:04,300 --> 01:16:08,650
ahead and be thugs they were gangsters

2023
01:16:06,909 --> 01:16:12,130
they went in there in [ __ ] stole and

2024
01:16:08,649 --> 01:16:13,509
destroyed [ __ ] they were vandals they

2025
01:16:12,130 --> 01:16:16,420
need to be held accountable that's my

2026
01:16:13,510 --> 01:16:17,980
opinion so I will keep you updated I'm

2027
01:16:16,420 --> 01:16:19,779
going to do some research on what

2028
01:16:17,979 --> 01:16:21,069
happened to the property I hope they get

2029
01:16:19,779 --> 01:16:22,689
their cannabis back I hope they get

2030
01:16:21,069 --> 01:16:24,429
their money back I hope they get their

2031
01:16:22,689 --> 01:16:26,259
edibles back I hope they make that cop

2032
01:16:24,430 --> 01:16:28,300
pay for the edible that he bought and

2033
01:16:26,260 --> 01:16:29,560
ate and I hope they also sue the [ __ ]

2034
01:16:28,300 --> 01:16:32,170
out of them for all the wages they've

2035
01:16:29,560 --> 01:16:35,410
lost in the mental anguish I hope this

2036
01:16:32,170 --> 01:16:38,440
comes back to bite this police force in

2037
01:16:35,409 --> 01:16:40,059
their asses alright I've got another

2038
01:16:38,439 --> 01:16:42,579

2039
01:16:40,060 --> 01:16:44,289
beautiful city of Pueblo Colorado you

2040
01:16:42,579 --> 01:16:46,029

the city of Pueblo Colorado and cannabis

2042
01:16:46,029 --> 01:16:50,619

2043
01:16:48,939 --> 01:16:53,079
that it's a fact but I've seen this in

2044
01:16:50,619 --> 01:16:56,380
more than one place I have seen in red

2045
01:16:53,079 --> 01:16:57,180
that Pueblo Colorado now produces the

2046
01:16:56,380 --> 01:17:00,180
most

2047
01:16:57,180 --> 01:17:01,800

01:17:08,039 --> 01:17:12,329
are great things are affordable here the

2053
01:17:10,680 --> 01:17:14,490

2054
01:17:12,329 --> 01:17:16,439

2055
01:17:14,489 --> 01:17:18,119

2056
01:17:16,439 --> 01:17:20,729

2057
01:17:18,119 --> 01:17:23,069

2058
01:17:20,729 --> 01:17:25,049

01:17:45,210 --> 01:17:49,980
grow but not everyone is high on the

2069
01:17:47,310 --> 01:17:52,500
idea how this article was written by a

01:20:12,559 --> 01:20:15,769
more than mud and puddles here bordered

2136
01:20:14,238 --> 01:20:17,328
by highway and railroad tracks and

2137

another 15,000 acres investing in

2146

dispensary opened in one of his

2153
01:20:53,149 --> 01:20:57,018
buildings he realized how lucrative the

2154
01:20:54,738 --> 01:20:59,448
business could be why he wondered am I

2155
01:20:57,019 --> 01:21:01,820
not doing this myself if he planted corn

2156
01:20:59,448 --> 01:21:04,098
on his corn on his land each acre would

2157
01:21:01,819 --> 01:21:07,219
require approximately 2.2 acre feet of

2158
01:21:04,099 --> 01:21:09,590
water per year and produced 768 dollars

that same acre planted with marijuana

2163
01:21:15,590 --> 01:21:21,529
would require roughly 2.6 5 feet of

2164
01:21:18,559 --> 01:21:24,949
water 2.65 acre feet of water excuse me

2168
01:21:29,748 --> 01:21:33,649
to read ever since the local steel

2169
01:21:31,578 --> 01:21:35,179
industry collapsed in the 1980s Pueblo

2170
01:21:33,649 --> 01:21:36,920
County has been seeking an economic

2171
01:21:35,179 --> 01:21:40,099
savior nearly a third of its population

2172
01:21:36,920 --> 01:21:41,670
is on public assistance and in 2000 the

2173
01:21:40,099 --> 01:21:43,380
metropolitan area around

2174

2175
01:21:43,380 --> 01:21:47,730
unemployment rate in the state when

2176
01:21:45,630 --> 01:21:50,130
Colorado voters passed amendment 64 in

2177
01:21:47,729 --> 01:21:52,049
2012 paving the way for legalized

2178
01:21:50,130 --> 01:21:53,310
marijuana the County Commissioners saw a

2179
01:21:52,050 --> 01:21:55,380
chance for revival

2180
01:21:53,310 --> 01:21:56,699
they hired Brian Vicente the Denver

2181
01:21:55,380 --> 01:21:58,710
lawyer who helped write the ballot

2182

2183
01:21:58,710 --> 01:22:03,630
and selling pot outside city limits as a

2184
01:22:00,979 --> 01:22:05,488

2185
01:22:03,630 --> 01:22:07,199
including Morley are now licensed or

2186
01:22:05,488 --> 01:22:09,448
conditionally approved to do so in the

2187
01:22:07,198 --> 01:22:10,738
county historically the biggest opponent

2188
01:22:09,448 --> 01:22:13,049
of marijuana reform has been the

2189
01:22:10,738 --> 01:22:14,009
government that sent a says here the

2190
01:22:13,050 --> 01:22:15,989
tables have turned

2191
01:22:14,010 --> 01:22:18,060
no one else in history has taken as

2192
01:22:15,988 --> 01:22:19,979
comprehensive look at establishing

2193
01:22:18,060 --> 01:22:21,840
marijuana business laws but will

2194
01:22:19,979 --> 01:22:23,729
county's economy he adds has gone

2195
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:26,069
through the roof and you guys this is my

2196
01:22:23,729 --> 01:22:26,909
my town this isn't this is where I live

2197
01:22:26,069 --> 01:22:28,829
I've lived here since I was

2198
01:22:26,909 --> 01:22:31,019
approximately fifteen years old I've

2199
01:22:28,829 --> 01:22:33,269
left a few times I've been back but I've

2200
01:22:31,020 --> 01:22:37,170
been here for quite a while I have seen

2201
01:22:33,270 --> 01:22:38,790
this town go from just a small boat out

2202
01:22:37,170 --> 01:22:40,770
it was a little podunk hick town when I

2203
01:22:38,789 --> 01:22:43,140
moved here then it turned into a city

2204
01:22:40,770 --> 01:22:44,610
and then I got going and then we had

2205
01:22:43,140 --> 01:22:46,619
some things happening and people were

2206
01:22:44,609 --> 01:22:48,420
buying houses and moving in and then at

2207
01:22:46,619 --> 01:22:50,099
one point everything stopped it seemed

2208
01:22:48,420 --> 01:22:53,100
like everything fell apart and everybody

2209
01:22:50,100 --> 01:22:55,469
went poor here myself included I was

2210
01:22:53,100 --> 01:22:57,630
struggling I worked [ __ ] jobs to get

2211
01:22:55,469 --> 01:22:59,159
myself through you know then I grew weed

2212
01:22:57,630 --> 01:23:00,719
on the side because it was the only way

2213
01:22:59,159 --> 01:23:03,149
that I could make ends meet was to grow

2214
01:23:00,719 --> 01:23:06,480
some cannabis now that we've got this

2215
01:23:03,149 --> 01:23:08,339
legal cannabis industry obviously I am

2216
01:23:06,479 --> 01:23:11,189
doing great for myself I have a legal

2217
01:23:08,340 --> 01:23:15,440
job I can go to work and pay taxes now

2218
01:23:11,189 --> 01:23:18,299
um it really helps our whole economy

2219
01:23:15,439 --> 01:23:22,859
because the people that were I'm gonna

2220
01:23:18,300 --> 01:23:24,480
see 22 to about 35 around here there

2221
01:23:22,859 --> 01:23:26,159
wasn't a lot for us to do we could

2222
01:23:24,479 --> 01:23:27,689
either work at gas stations or we could

2223
01:23:26,159 --> 01:23:29,939
work at a telemarketing place or we

2224
01:23:27,689 --> 01:23:31,589
could work Trappe jobs but with all of

2225
01:23:29,939 --> 01:23:34,198
the cannabis industry that has boomed up

2226
01:23:31,590 --> 01:23:37,409
myself and all of my friends are living

2227
01:23:34,198 --> 01:23:39,678
very well most of us grow weed most of

2228
01:23:37,409 --> 01:23:42,149
us trim weed most of us are bud tenders

2229
01:23:39,679 --> 01:23:44,310
9 out of 10 of my friends are involved

2230
01:23:42,149 --> 01:23:46,889
in the cannabis industry in some way and

2231
01:23:44,310 --> 01:23:47,460
none of us are hungry for anything

2232
01:23:46,890 --> 01:23:49,679
anymore

2233
01:23:47,460 --> 01:23:51,239
we've all got everything we need none of

2234
01:23:49,679 --> 01:23:52,350
us have to be criminals anymore we don't

2235
01:23:51,238 --> 01:23:54,468
have to do anything shady

2236
01:23:52,350 --> 01:23:56,809
we don't have to watch our backs

2237
01:23:54,469 --> 01:23:57,920
shoulders we go to work 9:00 to 5:00 or

2238
01:23:56,809 --> 01:24:00,288
whatever we do we work eight-hour

2239
01:23:57,920 --> 01:24:01,819
10-hour days you come home from work and

2240
01:24:00,288 --> 01:24:02,899
you don't have to worry about hustling

2241
01:24:01,819 --> 01:24:03,978
you don't have to worry about being a

2242
01:24:02,899 --> 01:24:05,388
drug dealer you don't have to worry

2243
01:24:03,979 --> 01:24:07,999
about the stupid [ __ ] that comes along

2244
01:24:05,389 --> 01:24:12,368
with an illegal pot industry I think

2245
01:24:07,998 --> 01:24:14,779
it's a great way to revive an economy

2246
01:24:12,368 --> 01:24:16,639
get benefits and health insurance and

2247
01:24:14,779 --> 01:24:17,779
pay taxes I mean you can't do that when

2248
01:24:16,639 --> 01:24:19,788
you're growing weed in the basement

2249
01:24:17,779 --> 01:24:22,759
selling it illegally they're not part of

2250
01:24:19,788 --> 01:24:25,189
the cogs of the community that make a

2251
01:24:22,760 --> 01:24:28,519
society work in the I of that society

2252
01:24:25,189 --> 01:24:29,598
you are a black-market drug dealer even

2253
01:24:28,519 --> 01:24:30,739
though you spend all your money and all

2254
01:24:29,599 --> 01:24:33,139
the restaurants and all the stores in

2255
01:24:30,738 --> 01:24:34,308
town people don't realize that now it

2256
01:24:33,139 --> 01:24:35,748
won't freak out when I walk into

2257
01:24:34,309 --> 01:24:37,760
Applebee's and buy dinner for me and all

2258
01:24:35,748 --> 01:24:39,078
my friends or wherever we go go to Qdoba

2259
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:40,429
and buy the whole true dinner they don't

2260
01:24:39,078 --> 01:24:41,960
look at you like dirty drug dealer they

2261
01:24:40,429 --> 01:24:43,279
look at you like oh that man has a job

2262
01:24:41,960 --> 01:24:43,849
that's kind of nice it's a big

2263
01:24:43,279 --> 01:24:45,738
difference

2264
01:24:43,849 --> 01:24:47,090
feels different it feels better I'm

2265
01:24:45,738 --> 01:24:49,368
gonna continue on with the article it

2266
01:24:47,090 --> 01:24:52,159
says but the area's relationship with

2267
01:24:49,368 --> 01:24:53,868
pot means remains ambivalent this is

2268
01:24:52,158 --> 01:24:55,609
after all a place where irate voters

2269
01:24:53,868 --> 01:24:57,319
recall their state senator over new gun

2270
01:24:55,609 --> 01:24:59,359
restrictions some worried that the

2271
01:24:57,319 --> 01:25:00,859
county's latest growth industry is

2272
01:24:59,359 --> 01:25:03,109
bringing social problems along with

2273
01:25:00,859 --> 01:25:04,670
money and others doubt whether the bold

2274
01:25:03,109 --> 01:25:07,848
experiment will reap the promised

2275
01:25:04,670 --> 01:25:09,739
rewards up to the 1970s Puebla was known

2276
01:25:07,849 --> 01:25:11,719
as PU town because of the steel mill

2277
01:25:09,738 --> 01:25:13,339
says Palo McPheeters co-founder of

2278
01:25:11,719 --> 01:25:15,590
Pueblo for positive impact which is a

2279
01:25:13,340 --> 01:25:17,538
which opposes the county's pot friendly

2280
01:25:15,590 --> 01:25:20,599
laws now we're getting known for that

2281
01:25:17,538 --> 01:25:23,090
again because of marijuana that group

2282
01:25:20,599 --> 01:25:25,309
shows up at all this uh let's see Pueblo

2283
01:25:23,090 --> 01:25:26,929
for a positive impact they show up in

2284
01:25:25,309 --> 01:25:29,119
all of the City Council meetings and

2285
01:25:26,929 --> 01:25:30,800
they try to fight down cannabis and the

2286
01:25:29,118 --> 01:25:32,118
cannabis use but honestly guys they

2287
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:34,248
don't do any research and they don't

2288
01:25:32,118 --> 01:25:36,198
know what they're talking about so if a

2289
01:25:34,248 --> 01:25:37,760
few members that do support cannabis

2290
01:25:36,198 --> 01:25:39,888
would show up we could shut these guys

2291
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:41,329
up every week lately Mike is the only

2292
01:25:39,889 --> 01:25:43,699
one that goes to the meetings

2293
01:25:41,328 --> 01:25:45,198
so I'd like to ask you guys to come to

2294
01:25:43,698 --> 01:25:48,109
City Council meetings when they happen

2295
01:25:45,198 --> 01:25:51,049
on Mondays and help us speak positively

2296
01:25:48,109 --> 01:25:53,210
about cannabis I'm a hypocrite as I

2297
01:25:51,050 --> 01:25:55,219
can't make it to every meeting but I do

2298
01:25:53,210 --> 01:25:56,310
go and I do try to voice my opinion when

2299
01:25:55,219 --> 01:25:58,260
I can

2300
01:25:56,310 --> 01:25:59,610
sorry I'm burping excuse me I'm a

2301
01:25:58,260 --> 01:26:01,020
continued article it says the city of

2302
01:25:59,609 --> 01:26:03,059
Pueblo sometimes called the Pittsburgh

2303
01:26:01,020 --> 01:26:05,850
of the West and like its steel town

2304
01:26:03,060 --> 01:26:08,160
sister city back east its glory years

2305
01:26:05,850 --> 01:26:10,170
lie in the past call center is one of

2306
01:26:08,159 --> 01:26:12,449
the few active industries dot it's the

2307
01:26:10,170 --> 01:26:15,000
downtown area Pablo County director of

2308
01:26:12,449 --> 01:26:16,800
economic development Chris Markuson says

2309
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:18,539
that one of his predecessors used to

2310
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:20,550
drive potential business owners down the

2311
01:26:18,539 --> 01:26:22,289
East Side's crumbling streets and past

2312
01:26:20,550 --> 01:26:24,180
crack houses and say enthusiastically

2313
01:26:22,289 --> 01:26:25,800
look at these people to work for

2314
01:26:24,180 --> 01:26:27,300
anything hoping that the promise of a

2315
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:30,210
cheap labor force would prove

2316
01:26:27,300 --> 01:26:31,920
irresistible amendment 64 gave local

2317
01:26:30,210 --> 01:26:33,630
governments the power to decide whether

2318
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:36,090
and how to prevent recreational pol

2319
01:26:33,630 --> 01:26:38,069
within their communities the Pueblo City

2320
01:26:36,090 --> 01:26:39,630
Council for example banned recreational

2321
01:26:38,069 --> 01:26:42,329
pot shops and grows within city limits

2322
01:26:39,630 --> 01:26:44,520
it reacted similarly when medical

2323
01:26:42,329 --> 01:26:46,470
marijuana was legalized in 2000 placing

2324
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:48,320
a moratorium on dispensaries the

2325
01:26:46,470 --> 01:26:52,289
Colorado marijuana enforcement divisions

2326
01:26:48,319 --> 01:26:53,670
2014 annual report says that 228 local

2327
01:26:52,289 --> 01:26:56,159
jurisdictions have voted to prohibit

2328
01:26:53,670 --> 01:26:58,529
medical and retail marijuana operations

2329
01:26:56,159 --> 01:27:00,659
but low County however rolled out the

2330
01:26:58,529 --> 01:27:02,399
welcome mat marijuana stores don't

2331
01:27:00,659 --> 01:27:04,439
require a lot of space a lot of space

2332
01:27:02,399 --> 01:27:06,000
but indoor grow operations can says

2333
01:27:04,439 --> 01:27:08,519
public County Commissioner Terry Hart

2334
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:10,439
and Pueblo County got hit pretty hard on

2335
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:11,700
the recession so we had a lot of empty

2336
01:27:10,439 --> 01:27:13,379
commercial buildings throughout the

2337
01:27:11,699 --> 01:27:15,840
county that realtor's were trying

2338
01:27:13,380 --> 01:27:17,670
desperately to fill like some other pot

2339
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:19,800
friendly communities the county made

2340
01:27:17,670 --> 01:27:21,449
marijuana businesses a use by right in

2341
01:27:19,800 --> 01:27:22,800
industrial and business districts

2342
01:27:21,449 --> 01:27:24,599
meaning they weren't subject to

2343
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:26,880
sometimes time-consuming and arduous

2344
01:27:24,600 --> 01:27:29,100
special reviews or approvals by local

2345
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:30,510
government but Pueblo County offered

2346
01:27:29,100 --> 01:27:33,079
something beyond cheap real estate

2347
01:27:30,510 --> 01:27:36,060
unlike Denver it had an abundance of

2348
01:27:33,079 --> 01:27:38,039
available agricultural land so local

2349
01:27:36,060 --> 01:27:40,170
officials made marijuana cultivation a

2350
01:27:38,039 --> 01:27:42,449
use by right here right there too

2351
01:27:40,170 --> 01:27:44,250
likely the first Colorado County to do

2352
01:27:42,449 --> 01:27:46,739
so according to Vicente and Joan

2353
01:27:44,250 --> 01:27:49,199
Armstrong pueblos Pueblo County's

2354
01:27:46,739 --> 01:27:51,359
Planning Director the county had also

2355
01:27:49,199 --> 01:27:54,000
issued pioneering rules that prohibit

2356
01:27:51,359 --> 01:27:56,219
hemp crows with male plants from being

2357
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:59,340
located within five miles of existing

2358
01:27:56,220 --> 01:28:00,780
marijuana grows this pre this prevents

2359
01:27:59,340 --> 01:28:02,670
cross-pollination that can lower the

2360
01:28:00,779 --> 01:28:03,259
marijuana plants THC content while

2361
01:28:02,670 --> 01:28:06,690
increasing

2362
01:28:03,260 --> 01:28:08,760
THC and hemp which can exceed 0.3

2363
01:28:06,689 --> 01:28:10,139
percent under state law

2364
01:28:08,760 --> 01:28:11,489
so that does make sense although they

2365
01:28:10,140 --> 01:28:12,060
kind of worded this weirdly you could

2366
01:28:11,488 --> 01:28:14,909
tell they don't know what they're

2367
01:28:12,060 --> 01:28:16,770
talking about but the city also issued

2368
01:28:14,909 --> 01:28:19,619
rules saying that you cannot grow hemp

2369
01:28:16,770 --> 01:28:21,720
within 5 miles of a cannabis grow which

2370
01:28:19,619 --> 01:28:23,399
is a great thing because like they say

2371
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:25,369
here it prevents cross-pollination which

2372
01:28:23,399 --> 01:28:27,569
we're not too worried about getting the

2373
01:28:25,369 --> 01:28:29,550
cannabis into the hemp because we're not

2374
01:28:27,569 --> 01:28:31,649
growing male plants outside all of our

2375
01:28:29,550 --> 01:28:33,090
growers are pro growers and we've gotten

2376
01:28:31,649 --> 01:28:34,949
rid of the mail the only mails you would

2377
01:28:33,090 --> 01:28:36,239
find would be on the hemp farms we don't

2378
01:28:34,949 --> 01:28:38,429
need the hemp farms [ __ ] up the

2379
01:28:36,238 --> 01:28:40,019
cannabis plants I'll continue with the

2380
01:28:38,430 --> 01:28:41,579
article it says even the Pueblo Board of

2381
01:28:40,020 --> 01:28:43,080
Water Works the local utility that

2382
01:28:41,579 --> 01:28:44,609
leases water for businesses and

2383
01:28:43,079 --> 01:28:46,738
agricultural use is trying to

2384
01:28:44,609 --> 01:28:48,509
accommodate the industry last year when

2385
01:28:46,738 --> 01:28:50,699
the barrel of Reclamation reclamation

2386
01:28:48,510 --> 01:28:52,530
explicitly prohibited the use of federal

2387
01:28:50,699 --> 01:28:55,139
water for pot cultivation water boiler

2388
01:28:52,529 --> 01:28:56,579
water board employees calculated that

2389
01:28:55,140 --> 01:28:58,530
they could lease a few eight hundred

2390
01:28:56,579 --> 01:29:01,319
acre feet of raw water to marijuana

2391
01:28:58,529 --> 01:29:03,809
cultivators without running afoul of the

2392
01:29:01,319 --> 01:29:05,909
feds this was completely new territory

2393
01:29:03,810 --> 01:29:08,010
for us his resources manager Alan Ward

2394
01:29:05,909 --> 01:29:09,899
who notes ninety-two acre feet of the

2395
01:29:08,010 --> 01:29:12,750
so-called marijuana water was already

2396
01:29:09,899 --> 01:29:14,729
under contract as of this May when

2397
01:29:12,750 --> 01:29:15,899
amendment 64 was first passed I didn't

2398
01:29:14,729 --> 01:29:18,238
put much thought into how it was going

2399
01:29:15,899 --> 01:29:19,619
to affect my job but for a few months it

2400
01:29:18,238 --> 01:29:22,019
seemed like it was nearly all I was

2401
01:29:19,619 --> 01:29:25,050
focused on the new rules are more than

2402
01:29:22,020 --> 01:29:27,450
paying for themselves in 2014 the county

2403
01:29:25,050 --> 01:29:29,489
mended 1.8 million dollars from

2404
01:29:27,449 --> 01:29:31,619
licensing licensing fees for pot

2405
01:29:29,488 --> 01:29:33,569
establishments and marijuana sales taxes

2406
01:29:31,619 --> 01:29:35,250
covering the cost of its virtual

2407
01:29:33,569 --> 01:29:37,349

Growers Association the local marijuana

2440
01:30:39,260 --> 01:30:44,659
trade orgs in an organization claims the

2441
01:30:41,060 --> 01:30:46,130
industry has provided 1,300 new jobs and

2442
01:30:44,659 --> 01:30:47,479
contributed more than a hundred and

2443
01:30:46,130 --> 01:30:50,449
twenty million dollars to the local

2444
01:30:47,479 --> 01:30:52,459
economy because I can list twenty five

2445
01:30:50,449 --> 01:30:55,340
people I know that have jobs because of

2446
01:30:52,460 --> 01:30:58,579
this boom in cannabis and they all work

2447
01:30:55,340 --> 01:30:59,930
at the spot there's one shop that I can

2448
01:30:58,579 --> 01:31:01,430
list twenty five people that are

2449
01:30:59,930 --> 01:31:03,560
employed because of this cannabis

2450
01:31:01,430 --> 01:31:04,909
industry and that is one shop and I

2451
01:31:03,560 --> 01:31:08,060
think there are fourteen or sixteen

2452
01:31:04,909 --> 01:31:09,500
shops just in Pueblo West so that's a

2453
01:31:08,060 --> 01:31:11,480
lot of people that are employed because

2454
01:31:09,500 --> 01:31:13,310
of cannabis the county was also hoping

2455
01:31:11,479 --> 01:31:15,319
to attract marijuana testing labs and

2456
01:31:13,310 --> 01:31:16,970

don't have to be a pothead just to

2476
01:31:53,869 --> 01:31:57,289
consume cannabis the fact that Pueblo

heated County Commissioners have

received threatening phone calls and

01:32:03,560 --> 01:32:07,310
growers worries that some zealot with a

01:32:05,090 --> 01:32:09,380
crop duster could devastate the outdoor

2484

01:32:09,380 --> 01:32:13,460
headlong into this without consulting

2486
01:32:10,939 --> 01:32:15,619
the county residents complaints public

2487
01:32:13,460 --> 01:32:17,420
for positive impact McPheeters

2488
01:32:15,619 --> 01:32:19,970
I guess that's the head the head of that

2489
01:32:17,420 --> 01:32:21,739
organization that allowed a glut of

2490
01:32:19,970 --> 01:32:23,510
marijuana stores and indoor grows to

2491
01:32:21,739 --> 01:32:25,760

yeah like I said they're like 14 shops

2495
01:32:28,100 --> 01:32:31,550
out there and you know what none of them

2496
01:32:29,449 --> 01:32:33,920
cause any problems we have armed

2497
01:32:31,550 --> 01:32:35,070
security guards people pull into our

2498
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:36,779
parking lot they

2499
01:32:35,069 --> 01:32:38,429
walk into our store they make a purchase

2500
01:32:36,779 --> 01:32:39,719
just like they would any other store

2501
01:32:38,429 --> 01:32:42,630
there's a sandwich shop right down the

2502
01:32:39,719 --> 01:32:45,420
street there's a saw and tool shop right

2503
01:32:42,630 --> 01:32:47,159
down the street the San Isabel Electric

2504
01:32:45,420 --> 01:32:48,750
is right across the street people pull

2505
01:32:47,158 --> 01:32:50,908
up in their car they walk in and they do

2506
01:32:48,750 --> 01:32:53,368
business they walk back out to their car

2507
01:32:50,908 --> 01:32:55,259
and they drive away nothing bad happens

2508
01:32:53,368 --> 01:32:57,118
on our dispensary if you try to do

2509
01:32:55,260 --> 01:32:58,440
something stupid or our dispensary our

2510
01:32:57,118 --> 01:33:00,719
security guard will walk outside and

2511
01:32:58,439 --> 01:33:03,000
tell you to leave if I see you smoking

2512
01:33:00,719 --> 01:33:04,289
on the premises of our dispensary I will

2513
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,609
tell you to get the hell out of there

2514
01:33:04,289 --> 01:33:06,719
I'm rude about it so you can't smoke

2515
01:33:05,609 --> 01:33:08,429
here get the [ __ ] out of here what

2516
01:33:06,719 --> 01:33:10,408
are you trying to do and you people just

2517
01:33:08,429 --> 01:33:11,609
drive away I've got somebody smoking in

2518
01:33:10,408 --> 01:33:13,469
the back while I was headed for my lunch

2519
01:33:11,609 --> 01:33:16,078
break they just drove away we don't

2520
01:33:13,469 --> 01:33:17,489
tolerate that [ __ ] we don't want it we

2521
01:33:16,078 --> 01:33:18,840
are a business we're not there to cause

2522
01:33:17,488 --> 01:33:21,509
problems were there to make money I

2523
01:33:18,840 --> 01:33:23,159
don't see why people are so wrapped up

2524
01:33:21,510 --> 01:33:25,440
and not having a dispensary around them

2525
01:33:23,158 --> 01:33:27,299
I'll continue with the article the

2526
01:33:25,439 --> 01:33:28,710
growth has come at a steep social cost

2527
01:33:27,300 --> 01:33:30,750
McPheeters and other critics say

2528
01:33:28,710 --> 01:33:33,480
marijuana related crimes including the

2529
01:33:30,750 --> 01:33:35,158
2014 are armed robbery of a marijuana

2530
01:33:33,479 --> 01:33:37,439
shop have increased according to

2531
01:33:35,158 --> 01:33:39,359
undersheriff Junior Hall meanwhile local

2532
01:33:37,439 --> 01:33:40,979
affordable housing organizations and

2533
01:33:39,359 --> 01:33:43,348
shelters have been flooded with families

2534
01:33:40,979 --> 01:33:46,589
who traveled here hoping to find jobs in

2535
01:33:43,349 --> 01:33:48,449
the first four months of 2015 alone 306

2536
01:33:46,590 --> 01:33:50,789
households relocated to public because

2537
01:33:48,448 --> 01:33:52,759
of marijuana says and stable men who

2538
01:33:50,789 --> 01:33:55,920
directs a nonprofit housing assistance

2539
01:33:52,760 --> 01:33:57,690
organization called Posada it is not

2540
01:33:55,920 --> 01:33:59,849
easy to get a good-paying job in the pot

2541
01:33:57,689 --> 01:34:01,408
industry settlement says many people

2542
01:33:59,849 --> 01:34:05,250
can't pass the background checks and

2543
01:34:01,408 --> 01:34:06,629
other checks needed um so these people

2544
01:34:05,250 --> 01:34:09,960
are saying that cannabis is causing

2545
01:34:06,630 --> 01:34:12,328
problems because there was a break in an

2546
01:34:09,960 --> 01:34:15,539
armed robbery of a marijuana shop that's

2547
01:34:12,328 --> 01:34:18,389
one incident and that [ __ ] happens at

2548
01:34:15,539 --> 01:34:20,158
gas stations and liquor stores once a

2549
01:34:18,389 --> 01:34:22,020
week around here and nobody says [ __ ]

2550
01:34:20,158 --> 01:34:24,868
about it it happened to one dispensary

2551
01:34:22,020 --> 01:34:26,880
and it's [ __ ] headline news I dismiss

2552
01:34:24,868 --> 01:34:28,589
you're one there are so many days in a

2553
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:30,810
year and so many dispensaries that this

2554
01:34:28,590 --> 01:34:34,289
one is going to happen that's just [ __ ]

2555
01:34:30,810 --> 01:34:36,719
that you expect in society and then they

2556
01:34:34,289 --> 01:34:39,090
say these 306 households that relocated

2557
01:34:36,719 --> 01:34:40,618
to puebla because of marijuana we didn't

2558
01:34:39,090 --> 01:34:42,090
send you an invitation we didn't ask

2559
01:34:40,618 --> 01:34:43,769
them to come we didn't bring them here

2560
01:34:42,090 --> 01:34:45,690
without a job and is their fault

2561
01:34:43,770 --> 01:34:47,099
that's not cannabis his fault they tried

2562
01:34:45,689 --> 01:34:48,379
to move here without getting a job first

2563
01:34:47,099 --> 01:34:50,150
they tried to move here without

2564
01:34:48,380 --> 01:34:51,590
getting the proper paperwork to work in

2565
01:34:50,149 --> 01:34:53,359
the industry they moved here without

2566
01:34:51,590 --> 01:34:54,500
knowing how to trim they just showed up

2567
01:34:53,359 --> 01:34:56,238
that's not our fault

2568
01:34:54,500 --> 01:34:57,710
that's not cannabis is fault that's poor

2569
01:34:56,238 --> 01:34:59,119
planning I'm gonna continue with the

2570
01:34:57,710 --> 01:35:01,550
article it says and the problems could

2571
01:34:59,119 --> 01:35:03,319
have been and the problems could have

2572
01:35:01,550 --> 01:35:05,060
repercussions far beyond Pablo County

2573
01:35:03,319 --> 01:35:06,948
and February a local couple filed a

2574
01:35:05,060 --> 01:35:09,110
lawsuit US District Court claiming that

2575
01:35:06,948 --> 01:35:11,269
the pot girl-next-door devalued their

2576
01:35:09,109 --> 01:35:13,069
property it's one of two lawsuits aimed

2577
01:35:11,270 --> 01:35:14,630
at striking down Colorado system on the

2578
01:35:13,069 --> 01:35:17,389
grounds that it conflicts with federal

2579
01:35:14,630 --> 01:35:19,940
drug laws even if the state laws stand

2580
01:35:17,389 --> 01:35:21,380
pat Oglesby a tax attorney who studies

2581
01:35:19,939 --> 01:35:23,059
marijuana at the center for new revenue

2582
01:35:21,380 --> 01:35:24,770
in north carolina isn't sure how much

2583
01:35:23,060 --> 01:35:28,010
Pablo has head start in the reefer race

2584
01:35:24,770 --> 01:35:30,830
will ultimately pay off a 2015 report he

2585
01:35:28,010 --> 01:35:32,389
co-authored concluded that roughly 220

2586
01:35:30,829 --> 01:35:33,738
thousand acres of pot would supplied the

2587
01:35:32,389 --> 01:35:35,300
entire US market

2588
01:35:33,738 --> 01:35:37,939
it sounds like they have a plan they

2589
01:35:35,300 --> 01:35:39,320
plan it sounds like they have a plan to

2590
01:35:37,939 --> 01:35:41,119
really have a huge amount of supply

2591
01:35:39,319 --> 01:35:43,340
while other jurisdictions aren't

2592
01:35:41,119 --> 01:35:44,719
licensing any growers so you could see

2593
01:35:43,340 --> 01:35:46,279
the county gaining a short-term

2594
01:35:44,719 --> 01:35:48,619
advantage and having a huge market share

2595
01:35:46,279 --> 01:35:51,259
says Oglesby whether that is an

2596
01:35:48,619 --> 01:35:54,050
advantage that can be kept over time I

2597
01:35:51,260 --> 01:35:56,030
don't know so he's saying let's see

2598
01:35:54,050 --> 01:35:58,900
where did he say that 20,000 acres of

2599
01:35:56,029 --> 01:36:01,550
pot would supply the entire US market I

2600
01:35:58,899 --> 01:36:04,789
don't know how accurate that is you guys

2601
01:36:01,550 --> 01:36:06,770
because right now um there is no pot on

2602
01:36:04,789 --> 01:36:08,300
the street the street has ran out of

2603
01:36:06,770 --> 01:36:10,850
weed because people don't want to go to

2604
01:36:08,300 --> 01:36:13,190
dispensaries and right now in my area

2605
01:36:10,850 --> 01:36:15,199
there is usually weed abundant there's

2606
01:36:13,189 --> 01:36:16,579
usually some dank a syrup on the streets

2607
01:36:15,198 --> 01:36:18,319
if you want to sack a weed it's not a

2608
01:36:16,579 --> 01:36:20,869
problem to get it out for somewhere

2609
01:36:18,319 --> 01:36:24,529
between 150 to 200 bucks for some fire

2610
01:36:20,869 --> 01:36:26,630
right now an ounce weed is always 200

2611
01:36:24,529 --> 01:36:28,819
bucks if you can find a good outs so

2612
01:36:26,630 --> 01:36:30,800
something's going on there smoking up

2613
01:36:28,819 --> 01:36:32,809
all the weed I don't know that 20,000

2614
01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:34,610
acres would supply the entire US market

2615
01:36:32,810 --> 01:36:36,440
because there are medical patients that

2616
01:36:34,609 --> 01:36:38,719
smoke a half ounce a day they turn it

2617
01:36:36,439 --> 01:36:40,849
into concentrates or edibles and they'll

2618
01:36:38,719 --> 01:36:43,579
consume a half ounce a day so this guy

2619
01:36:40,850 --> 01:36:46,370
may be under estimating this he's going

2620
01:36:43,579 --> 01:36:49,460
by just numbers that have been gathered

2621
01:36:46,369 --> 01:36:50,869
by polls excuse me I'm burping he's

2622
01:36:49,460 --> 01:36:52,969
going by numbers that have been gathered

2623
01:36:50,869 --> 01:36:54,738
by social scientists or whatever and

2624
01:36:52,969 --> 01:36:57,109
those numbers are probably not accurate

2625
01:36:54,738 --> 01:36:59,479
because people aren't honest when people

2626
01:36:57,109 --> 01:37:01,279
do polls and surveys I'm gonna keep

2627
01:36:59,479 --> 01:37:03,139
reading you guys it says

2628
01:37:01,279 --> 01:37:06,109
in the meantime the townie town the tiny

2629

Israeli cannabis researchers as she

2654
01:37:56,600 --> 01:38:00,410
rightly observes between serving up

2655
01:37:58,489 --> 01:38:03,949
rounds of beers if it makes money I

2656

infant great-granddaughter it's a shame

2821
01:49:02,949 --> 01:49:07,159
after a breakfast of steak and eggs with

2822
01:49:05,149 --> 01:49:09,079
family Basinski said he planned to spend

2823
01:49:07,159 --> 01:49:10,579
his post prison life seeking a job in

2824
01:49:09,079 --> 01:49:11,149
advocating for the legalization of

2825
01:49:10,579 --> 01:49:12,979
marijuana

2826
01:49:11,149 --> 01:49:14,629
he criticized sentencing for some

2827
01:49:12,979 --> 01:49:17,109
drug-related crimes is unfair and

2828
01:49:14,630 --> 01:49:19,789
described his time behind bars as hell

2829
01:49:17,109 --> 01:49:21,889
his release followed years of lobbying

2830
01:49:19,789 --> 01:49:23,539
by relatives lawmakers and others who

2831
01:49:21,890 --> 01:49:25,190
argued that the sentence was too stiff

2832
01:49:23,539 --> 01:49:28,489
and that marijuana should not be

2833
01:49:25,189 --> 01:49:30,049
forbidden Lozinski was sinced in 1996

2834
01:49:28,489 --> 01:49:31,880
the same year California became the

2835
01:49:30,050 --> 01:49:34,100
first state to legalize marijuana for

2836
01:49:31,880 --> 01:49:36,800
medical purposes medical marijuana is

2837
01:49:34,100 --> 01:49:38,690
now legal in 23 states and recreational

2838
01:49:36,800 --> 01:49:41,090
marijuana has been legalized in Alaska

2839
01:49:38,689 --> 01:49:43,729
Colorado Oregon Washington State and

2840
01:49:41,090 --> 01:49:45,289
Washington DC the reason he's getting

2841
01:49:43,729 --> 01:49:47,329
out is because the public clearly has

2842
01:49:45,289 --> 01:49:49,250
changed it's changed its opinion about

2843
01:49:47,329 --> 01:49:51,920
marijuana and it's just one of many ways

2844
01:49:49,250 --> 01:49:53,659
in which that has been reflected in

2845
01:49:51,920 --> 01:49:56,569
recent years Edmonds in skis attorney

2846
01:49:53,659 --> 01:49:58,279
Dan meets such extreme cases should

2847
01:49:56,569 --> 01:49:59,869
further feel changing perceptions of

01:49:58,279 --> 01:50:02,359

every day I say hi I'm Ross too Jeff so

2857
01:50:16,130 --> 01:50:19,850
much easier the article says these cases

2858
01:50:18,350 --> 01:50:22,700
really become Exhibit A in the need for

2859
01:50:19,850 --> 01:50:24,920
sentencing reform said D I think that's

2860
01:50:22,699 --> 01:50:27,679
how you said that an attorney and expert

2861
01:50:24,920 --> 01:50:29,810
in criminal justice policy just last

2862
01:50:27,680 --> 01:50:31,760
year the heavily Republican Missouri

2863
01:50:29,810 --> 01:50:34,070
Legislature passed a law to allow

2864
01:50:31,760 --> 01:50:35,150
certain people with epsilen epilepsy to

2865
01:50:34,069 --> 01:50:38,239
seek treatment with the marijuana

2866
01:50:35,149 --> 01:50:40,250
extracting extract containing little of

2867
01:50:38,239 --> 01:50:41,929
the chemical that causes marijuana users

2868
01:50:40,250 --> 01:50:43,939
to feel high and larger amounts of a

2869
01:50:41,930 --> 01:50:44,510
chemical called Kenneth cannabidiol or

2870
01:50:43,939 --> 01:50:46,729
CBD

2871
01:50:44,510 --> 01:50:48,710
the patient's can include babies Veet

2872
01:50:46,729 --> 01:50:50,869
said nobody saw that coming he said

2873
01:50:48,710 --> 01:50:53,180
that's a pretty radical statement police

2874
01:50:50,869 --> 01:50:54,859
said he conspired to sell six pounds of

2875
01:50:53,180 --> 01:50:57,200
marijuana to a dealer connected with the

2876
01:50:54,859 --> 01:50:59,029
Mexican drug cartels at the time the

2877
01:50:57,199 --> 01:51:00,859
life with no parole sentences was

2878
01:50:59,029 --> 01:51:03,469
allowed under a Missouri law for repeat

2879
01:51:00,859 --> 01:51:05,569
drug offenders mizanskey already had to

2880
01:51:03,470 --> 01:51:06,980

2881
01:51:05,569 --> 01:51:09,649
possession and one for sale of marijuana

2882
01:51:06,979 --> 01:51:12,649
in 1984 and another for possessing

2883
01:51:09,649 --> 01:51:14,659
possession in 1991 he was the only

2884
01:51:12,649 --> 01:51:16,429
Missouri inmate serving such a sentence

2885
01:51:14,659 --> 01:51:18,170
for a nonviolent marijuana related

2886
01:51:16,430 --> 01:51:20,300
offense when Democratic governor jay

2887
01:51:18,170 --> 01:51:22,970
Nixon agreed in May to commute his

2888
01:51:20,300 --> 01:51:25,039
sentence commutation allowed mizanskey

2889
01:51:22,970 --> 01:51:26,659
to argue for his freedom before a parole

2890
01:51:25,039 --> 01:51:27,319
board which granted his request in

2891
01:51:26,659 --> 01:51:29,750
August

2892
01:51:27,319 --> 01:51:31,609
Nixon Nixon's actions are a reflection

2893
01:51:29,750 --> 01:51:33,949
of political confidence in changing

2894
01:51:31,609 --> 01:51:36,559
norms around marijuana use said Cecilia

2895
01:51:33,949 --> 01:51:38,000
clincal a criminal justice policy expert

2896
01:51:36,560 --> 01:51:40,489
at the University of Wisconsin law

2897
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:42,409
school the governor cited mizanskey 'z

2898
01:51:40,488 --> 01:51:44,089
nonviolent record noting that none of

2899
01:51:42,409 --> 01:51:45,769
his offenses involved selling drugs to

2900
01:51:44,090 --> 01:51:47,449
children the law under which he was

2901
01:51:45,770 --> 01:51:49,269
originally sentenced has since been

2902
01:51:47,449 --> 01:51:51,309
changed

2903
01:51:49,269 --> 01:51:53,440
other states are reevaluating punishment

2904
01:51:51,309 --> 01:51:56,349
for drug possession crimes motivated in

2905
01:51:53,439 --> 01:51:58,118
large in large part by the high cost of

2906
01:51:56,349 --> 01:52:00,429
imprisoning low-level nonviolent

2907
01:51:58,118 --> 01:52:02,498
offenders you guys imagine how much it

2908
01:52:00,429 --> 01:52:03,880
cost to keep this dude in prison for

2909
01:52:02,498 --> 01:52:05,859
twenty years we could have sent people

2910
01:52:03,880 --> 01:52:08,199
to it cost more money to send people to

2911
01:52:05,859 --> 01:52:09,670
prison for years than it does to send

2912
01:52:08,198 --> 01:52:11,979
somebody to college is what I recently

2913
01:52:09,670 --> 01:52:13,239
read we probably could've send three or

2914
01:52:11,979 --> 01:52:14,618
four he was in there for twenty years

2915
01:52:13,238 --> 01:52:16,808
probably could have send five or ten

2916
01:52:14,618 --> 01:52:18,929
people to college for the cost that it

2917
01:52:16,809 --> 01:52:22,210
cost to house him and nothing came of it

2918
01:52:18,929 --> 01:52:24,429
maybe maybe in the long term he will

2919
01:52:22,210 --> 01:52:25,630
affect people being released maybe he

2920
01:52:24,429 --> 01:52:27,340
did some good I think that's called a

2921
01:52:25,630 --> 01:52:29,050
martyr is that what he was maybe he was

2922
01:52:27,340 --> 01:52:30,998
a martyr so maybe it was worth it for

2923
01:52:29,050 --> 01:52:32,320
the movement but not for him and not for

2924
01:52:30,998 --> 01:52:34,420
you no but they could have [ __ ]

2925
01:52:32,319 --> 01:52:35,859
educated some people for this cost I'm

2926
01:52:34,420 --> 01:52:37,359
gonna keep reading my article here it

2927
01:52:35,859 --> 01:52:38,738
says in Connecticut a new law will make

2928
01:52:37,359 --> 01:52:40,448
possession of small amounts of hard

2929
01:52:38,738 --> 01:52:42,549
drugs including heroin cocaine and crack

2930
01:52:40,448 --> 01:52:43,988
cocaine a misdemeanor for a first-time

2931
01:52:42,550 --> 01:52:45,489
offense rather than allowing for the

2932
01:52:43,988 --> 01:52:48,069
current maximum seven-year prison

2933
01:52:45,488 --> 01:52:49,689
sentence Nebraska and Alabama expect to

2934
01:52:48,069 --> 01:52:51,219
save hundreds of millions of dollars by

2935
01:52:49,689 --> 01:52:53,109
using new laws to cut down on the number

2936
01:52:51,219 --> 01:52:55,328
of offenders locked up for possessing

2937
01:52:53,109 --> 01:52:57,248
small amounts of drugs in Missouri

2938
01:52:55,328 --> 01:52:59,139
backers of two ballot initiatives to

2939
01:52:57,248 --> 01:53:00,939
legalize pot have permission from the

2940
01:52:59,139 --> 01:53:02,498
Secretary of State to begin collecting

2941
01:53:00,939 --> 01:53:06,098
signatures to put the issue before

2942
01:53:02,498 --> 01:53:08,109
voters in 2016 another petition proposes

2943
01:53:06,099 --> 01:53:09,788
reducing sentences for nonviolent drug

2944
01:53:08,109 --> 01:53:12,488
offenders or serving time without

2945
01:53:09,788 --> 01:53:14,139
opportunity for parole bosanski said he

2946
01:53:12,488 --> 01:53:16,569
will not smoke marijuana now that he's

2947
01:53:14,139 --> 01:53:18,159
free he's on parole after all but if it

2948
01:53:16,569 --> 01:53:20,670
ever becomes legal on the state and

2949
01:53:18,158 --> 01:53:23,529
federal level mizanskey said definitely

2950
01:53:20,670 --> 01:53:24,998
so big congratulations welcome home I

2951
01:53:23,529 --> 01:53:26,439
think he's gonna help out the movement

2952
01:53:24,998 --> 01:53:27,969
if they're releasing one guy

2953
01:53:26,439 --> 01:53:29,768
why aren't they gonna start releasing

2954
01:53:27,969 --> 01:53:31,929
all of the people who are in jail

2955
01:53:29,769 --> 01:53:34,239
anybody that committed any nonviolent

2956
01:53:31,929 --> 01:53:36,279
cannabis crime I think they should all

2957
01:53:34,238 --> 01:53:37,689
just start releasing them just go and

2958
01:53:36,279 --> 01:53:40,389
lock the cage and let those dudes out

2959
01:53:37,689 --> 01:53:41,809
and I'm a joint and 100 bucks and send

2960
01:53:40,389 --> 01:53:45,440

2961
01:53:41,810 --> 01:53:47,630

2963
01:53:47,630 --> 01:53:52,880

2965
01:53:52,880 --> 01:53:59,090
give you a little ketchup story behind

2966
01:53:54,979 --> 01:54:01,129
this recently let me see if they tell

2967
01:53:59,090 --> 01:54:02,960
you in this okay there was recently a

2968
01:54:01,130 --> 01:54:04,279
bunch of marijuana products in Colorado

2969
01:54:02,960 --> 01:54:07,069
that were taken off of the shelves

2970
01:54:04,279 --> 01:54:09,859
because they were suspected of having

2971
01:54:07,069 --> 01:54:13,159
been produced with cannabis that had

2972
01:54:09,859 --> 01:54:16,359
been sprayed with pesticides that are

2973
01:54:13,159 --> 01:54:18,739
banned from the marijuana production

2974
01:54:16,359 --> 01:54:20,659
laws we have what's called the marijuana

2975
01:54:18,739 --> 01:54:23,179
Enforcement Division and they have made

2976
01:54:20,659 --> 01:54:25,849
laws in conjunction with the Department

2977
01:54:23,180 --> 01:54:27,710
of Agriculture to regulate the sprays

2978
01:54:25,850 --> 01:54:31,070
that can be put on these plants so

2979
01:54:27,710 --> 01:54:33,319
recently on the first a bunch of these

2980
01:54:31,069 --> 01:54:34,969
edibles and products were taken off of

2981
01:54:33,319 --> 01:54:36,590
shelves because they were suspected to

2982
01:54:34,970 --> 01:54:39,800
have been made with contaminated

2983
01:54:36,590 --> 01:54:42,110
cannabis I had that article planned to

2984
01:54:39,800 --> 01:54:43,850
read to you when I opened up my computer

2985
01:54:42,109 --> 01:54:45,380
today and went reading for news and

2986
01:54:43,850 --> 01:54:47,180
seeing what was going on the cannabis

2987

2993
01:54:58,579 --> 01:55:03,619
lifted the sub-headline says marijuana

2994
01:55:01,789 --> 01:55:06,050
products from mountain high suckers and

2995
01:55:03,619 --> 01:55:08,029
MMJ america showed no trace of an

2996
01:55:06,050 --> 01:55:10,010
unapproved pesticide listed among their

2997
01:55:08,029 --> 01:55:13,369
ingredients the company owners said they

2998
01:55:10,010 --> 01:55:15,860
were using old labeling so here we go oh

2999
01:55:13,369 --> 01:55:17,539
there's articles by David McCoy ax from

3000
01:55:15,859 --> 01:55:18,829
The Denver Post I found it on the

3001
01:55:17,539 --> 01:55:21,319
cannabis tea and it goes like this

3002
01:55:18,829 --> 01:55:22,909
Denver Health officials Wednesday lifted

3003
01:55:21,319 --> 01:55:24,679
a day old order to hold hundreds of

3004
01:55:22,909 --> 01:55:26,960
marijuana infused Lawson jizz and raw

3005
01:55:24,680 --> 01:55:28,909
marijuana from two businesses after lab

3006
01:55:26,960 --> 01:55:31,579
tests showed no trace of unapproved

3007
01:55:28,909 --> 01:55:33,500
pesticides did among their ingredients

3008
01:55:31,579 --> 01:55:35,269
the owners of Mountain High suckers and

3009
01:55:33,500 --> 01:55:37,460
MMJ America each said they had been

3010
01:55:35,270 --> 01:55:39,170
using old labels they included among

3011
01:55:37,460 --> 01:55:41,539
their ingredients a pesticide that today

3012
01:55:39,170 --> 01:55:44,239
is not approved for marijuana use the

3013
01:55:41,539 --> 01:55:45,739
pesticide spinosad had not been barred

3014
01:55:44,239 --> 01:55:47,630
for use when the labels were made the

3015
01:55:45,739 --> 01:55:50,449
owner said it looks like this was just

3016
01:55:47,630 --> 01:55:53,150
an unfortunate labeling issue said dan

3017
01:55:50,449 --> 01:55:55,789
roland denver spokesman for its office

3018
01:55:53,149 --> 01:55:57,349
for its Office of Marijuana Policy sorry

3019
01:55:55,789 --> 01:55:59,179
for my stumble there a state law

3020
01:55:57,350 --> 01:56:00,920
requires marijuana companies to list on

3021
01:55:59,179 --> 01:56:03,199
their product labels all pesticides

3022
01:56:00,920 --> 01:56:05,119
contaminates and herbicides used in the

3023
01:56:03,198 --> 01:56:07,009
production process the city's

3024
01:56:05,119 --> 01:56:08,750
enforcement action is the latest in a

3025
01:56:07,010 --> 01:56:10,730
series of actions related to pesticides

3026
01:56:08,750 --> 01:56:12,380
used on recreational and medical

3027
01:56:10,729 --> 01:56:14,750
marijuana because the drug remains

3028
01:56:12,380 --> 01:56:16,550
illegal under federal law the US

3029
01:56:14,750 --> 01:56:18,710
Environmental Protection Agency will not

3030
01:56:16,550 --> 01:56:19,610
establish any allowable pesticide uses

3031
01:56:18,710 --> 01:56:22,219
on marijuana

3032
01:56:19,609 --> 01:56:24,139
technically no regulated pesticide can

3033
01:56:22,219 --> 01:56:26,179
be legally used on marijuana but state

3034
01:56:24,140 --> 01:56:27,860
agriculture officials have said as long

3035
01:56:26,179 --> 01:56:29,329
as its use does not violate it

3036
01:56:27,859 --> 01:56:32,269
pesticides label warnings and

3037
01:56:29,329 --> 01:56:34,119

3039
01:56:34,119 --> 01:56:38,929

3040
01:56:36,738 --> 01:56:41,448
be removed from shelves and destroyed or

3041
01:56:38,929 --> 01:56:43,069

grower that had been using spinosad

3052
01:57:02,988 --> 01:57:07,339
mountain-high co-owner Chad Tribble said

3053
01:57:05,090 --> 01:57:09,380
that was before the state said it could

3054
01:57:07,340 --> 01:57:12,289
not he said back then it wasn't a

3055
01:57:09,380 --> 01:57:14,630
problem Tribble said he just didn't look

3056
01:57:12,289 --> 01:57:16,130
back on the labels it was a mistake it

3057
01:57:14,630 --> 01:57:18,319
was on there but the tests were clear

3058
01:57:16,130 --> 01:57:22,010
undetected we've never had a black mark

3059
01:57:18,319 --> 01:57:23,809
before now said now he said news of the

3060
01:57:22,010 --> 01:57:26,030
city's action brought calls from as far

3061
01:57:23,810 --> 01:57:27,770
as Las Vegas not only did we test

3062
01:57:26,029 --> 01:57:29,809
negative for all pesticides we were told

3063
01:57:27,770 --> 01:57:31,370
by the city that just crossing off the

3064
01:57:29,810 --> 01:57:33,920
name because we're already had the bags

3065
01:57:31,369 --> 01:57:35,988
printed was acceptable MMJ owner Jake

3066
01:57:33,920 --> 01:57:38,149
Salazar that's what MMG owner Jake

3067
01:57:35,988 --> 01:57:40,448
Salazar said officials later told him he

3068
01:57:38,149 --> 01:57:43,849
needs to reprint the labels we order

3069
01:57:40,448 --> 01:57:45,859
pre-printed bags 70,000 units every time

3070
01:57:43,850 --> 01:57:47,840
last time we ordered them this wasn't a

3071
01:57:45,859 --> 01:57:49,399
banned substance we now have to throw

3072
01:57:47,840 --> 01:57:51,619
all of those bags away and reorder

3073
01:57:49,399 --> 01:57:53,960
70,000 more without that ingredient

3074
01:57:51,619 --> 01:57:56,359
which we clearly don't use Salazar said

3075
01:57:53,960 --> 01:57:58,069
the state's list of pesticides approved

3076
01:57:56,359 --> 01:58:00,559
for use on marijuana has been in the

3077
01:57:58,069 --> 01:58:02,359
drafting stage for about 18 months the

3078
01:58:00,560 --> 01:58:04,190
state will not say the pesticides are

3079
01:58:02,359 --> 01:58:05,899
safe for use on marijuana only that

3080
01:58:04,189 --> 01:58:06,618
their use does not violate label

3081
01:58:05,899 --> 01:58:09,799
restrain

3082
01:58:06,618 --> 01:58:11,960
on how they should be used some

3083
01:58:09,800 --> 01:58:13,460
pesticides are so non-toxic that the EPA

3084
01:58:11,960 --> 01:58:16,069
does not require them to be registered

3085
01:58:13,460 --> 01:58:17,510
nor restrict their use those can be used

3086
01:58:16,069 --> 01:58:19,368
on marijuana but the industry has

3087
01:58:17,510 --> 01:58:20,929
complained that they aren't potent

3088
01:58:19,368 --> 01:58:23,000
enough to eradicate the kinds of pests

3089
01:58:20,929 --> 01:58:25,000
and mildews that can decimate a crop

3090
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:28,238
potentially worth millions of dollars

3091
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:31,250
the city in the spring held more than a

3092
01:58:28,238 --> 01:58:33,709
100,000 marijuana plants at 11 grow

3093
01:58:31,250 --> 01:58:36,380
operations over concerns that unapproved

3094
01:58:33,710 --> 01:58:38,060
pesticides had been used on them so this

3095
01:58:36,380 --> 01:58:42,050
article was from David McCoy a-- and

3096
01:58:38,060 --> 01:58:44,300
those products did not test for spinosad

3097
01:58:42,050 --> 01:58:46,159
they were using old labels now this

3098
01:58:44,300 --> 01:58:49,219
really sparks a little bit of question

3099
01:58:46,158 --> 01:58:51,519
in my mind because I advocate spinosad I

3100
01:58:49,219 --> 01:58:54,408
like spinosad I've used a spinosad

3101
01:58:51,520 --> 01:58:56,630
recently so this has me thinking I need

3102
01:58:54,408 --> 01:58:58,158
to go in here and go to the Department

3103
01:58:56,630 --> 01:59:00,739
of Agriculture website and figure out

3104
01:58:58,158 --> 01:59:01,399
why or whichever website it is it may be

3105
01:59:00,738 --> 01:59:03,348
the meed

3106
01:59:01,399 --> 01:59:05,388
I need to go and figure out why I'm not

3107
01:59:03,349 --> 01:59:08,409
allowed to use spinosad because I run a

3108
01:59:05,389 --> 01:59:10,819
shop I run a grow at a shop I need to

3109
01:59:08,408 --> 01:59:12,259
find this list of pesticides I'm not

3110
01:59:10,819 --> 01:59:14,299
quite sure where I find this list of

3111
01:59:12,260 --> 01:59:16,190
pesticides I'm sure that the operations

3112
01:59:14,300 --> 01:59:17,960
manager at the dispensary has it so I

3113
01:59:16,189 --> 01:59:19,009
ask him for that list we're not at that

3114
01:59:17,960 --> 01:59:22,010
point yet so I don't need to know that

3115
01:59:19,010 --> 01:59:23,810
but I'm sure the marijuana Enforcement

3116
01:59:22,010 --> 01:59:25,820
Division webpage has a list of approved

3117
01:59:23,810 --> 01:59:27,469
or unapproved pesticides all you gotta

3118
01:59:25,819 --> 01:59:28,849
do is go there and look I really want to

3119
01:59:27,469 --> 01:59:31,579
know why spinosad has been banned

3120
01:59:28,849 --> 01:59:34,210
because I use that quite quite often I

3121
01:59:31,579 --> 01:59:38,529
will definitely figure out why because

3122
01:59:34,210 --> 01:59:41,270
something that will help prevent this um

3123
01:59:38,529 --> 01:59:45,380
every dispensary will now be required to

3124
01:59:41,270 --> 01:59:47,659
train all plant handlers in pesticide

3125
01:59:45,380 --> 01:59:50,000
management everybody every dispensary

3126
01:59:47,658 --> 01:59:52,579
needs on staff one person that can train

3127
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:54,889
every new employee on pesticide safety

3128
01:59:52,579 --> 01:59:56,988
and to be able to train them you have to

3129
01:59:54,889 --> 01:59:58,460
be certified by the Department of

3130
01:59:56,988 --> 02:00:01,609
Agriculture you have to take an

3131
01:59:58,460 --> 02:00:03,319
applicator safety test and I have been

3132
02:00:01,609 --> 02:00:05,929
required to do that since I am the lead

3133
02:00:03,319 --> 02:00:07,549
grower at this spot dispensary so I will

3134
02:00:05,929 --> 02:00:09,408
be taking I will be studying and taking

3135
02:00:07,550 --> 02:00:11,480
that test and then I will know a lot of

3136
02:00:09,408 --> 02:00:15,019
stuff about pesticides and we will find

3137
02:00:11,479 --> 02:00:16,609
out why spinosad is unacceptable um the

3138
02:00:15,020 --> 02:00:18,320
Department of Agriculture representative

3139
02:00:16,609 --> 02:00:20,569
actually told me the reason that Eagle

3140
02:00:18,319 --> 02:00:23,210
20 is not allowed in commercial

3141
02:00:20,569 --> 02:00:26,210
drum roll please because when it burns

3142
02:00:23,210 --> 02:00:27,980
it turns into cyanide that's what the

3143
02:00:26,210 --> 02:00:29,840
guy from the Department of Agriculture

3144
02:00:27,979 --> 02:00:32,689
told me it had nothing to do with the

3145
02:00:29,840 --> 02:00:34,460
danger and toxicity of the chemical it

3146
02:00:32,689 --> 02:00:36,738
was actually because when it turns if

3147
02:00:34,460 --> 02:00:38,149
there's a fire it turns into cyanide and

3148
02:00:36,738 --> 02:00:40,069
the fire department doesn't want to deal

3149
02:00:38,149 --> 02:00:42,379
with that I found that rather

3150
02:00:40,069 --> 02:00:45,590
interesting all right guys I have got

3151
02:00:42,380 --> 02:00:47,750
one more news article this one is from

3152
02:00:45,590 --> 02:00:49,699
local news here this one comes from the

3153
02:00:47,750 --> 02:00:51,828
beautiful city of Pueblo Colorado I

3154
02:00:49,698 --> 02:00:54,738
talked a little bit about Pueblo last

3155
02:00:51,828 --> 02:00:56,988
time on the last episode talking about

3156
02:00:54,738 --> 02:00:58,308
how Colorado and Pueblo in general was

3157
02:00:56,988 --> 02:01:00,408
booming with cannabis and Pueblo

3158
02:00:58,309 --> 02:01:02,809
Colorado may become the may already be

3159
02:01:00,408 --> 02:01:05,118
the new Emerald triangle so this article

3160
02:01:02,809 --> 02:01:08,079
says funding college scholarships via

3161
02:01:05,118 --> 02:01:11,389
pot grows proposed in southern Colorado

3162

3169
02:01:27,579 --> 02:01:31,510

that's how we do it we take dad's in the

3184
02:02:07,100 --> 02:02:11,450
middle of the podcast we used to smoke

3185
02:02:09,529 --> 02:02:12,469
so much more hash on this show I've been

3186
02:02:11,449 --> 02:02:13,729
trying to get it a little tighter and

3187
02:02:12,470 --> 02:02:17,119
not be dad the [ __ ] out

3188
02:02:13,729 --> 02:02:20,059
it also helps my throat last longer all

3189
02:02:17,119 --> 02:02:21,680
right so well yeah that's it Anita Hayes

3190

from Colorado's best dad's and it makes

3191
02:02:21,680 --> 02:02:24,230
my head [ __ ] spin it's so great he

3192
02:02:23,359 --> 02:02:27,469
gets me amped up

3193
02:02:24,229 --> 02:02:28,789
it makes me lively hypothetically if I

3194
02:02:27,470 --> 02:02:30,350
were going to come home on my lunch

3195
02:02:28,789 --> 02:02:32,000
break and smoke a bunch of dabs and need

3196
02:02:30,350 --> 02:02:34,430
to go back to work all energized and in

3197
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:35,899
the zone hypothetically I would take 4

3198
02:02:34,430 --> 02:02:38,670
dabs of that and I'd be in the [ __ ]

3199
02:02:35,899 --> 02:02:41,399
zone when I went back to work

3200
02:02:38,670 --> 02:02:42,960

decide that I want to put the podcast on

3227
02:03:33,060 --> 02:03:35,610
periscope while I'm doing it and right

3229
02:03:35,609 --> 02:03:38,519
like I'm talking to somebody there's

3230
02:03:36,960 --> 02:03:39,869
somebody just someone to look at instead

3231
02:03:38,520 --> 02:03:41,730
of just staring into the computer over

3232
02:03:39,869 --> 02:03:43,649
here I'm looking at my periscope trends

3233
02:03:41,729 --> 02:03:45,779
I can't see them but it feels like

3234

they're there all right I've got another

3235
02:03:45,779 --> 02:03:49,050

headline says Pablo County Commissioner

3243
02:04:01,829 --> 02:04:06,090
Sal pace says he hopes the measure that

3244
02:04:03,600 --> 02:04:08,160
would Institute a 5 percent excise tax

3245
02:04:06,090 --> 02:04:11,760
on wholesale marijuana transfers will

3246

give Pablo kids a boost I am going to

3247
02:04:11,760 --> 02:04:14,360
read this article

3248
02:04:14,729 --> 02:04:19,319
and I have mixed opinions on this right

3249
02:04:17,130 --> 02:04:21,000
now but it's by Jessie Paul it's from

3250
02:04:19,319 --> 02:04:22,889
the Denver Post I of course found it on

high-quality cannabis news it's ran by a

3258
02:04:34,800 --> 02:04:38,550

3261
02:04:39,920 --> 02:04:44,489
all right the article goes like this if

3262
02:04:43,079 --> 02:04:46,140
webelo county commissioner is proposing

3263
02:04:44,488 --> 02:04:47,669
a ballot measure for a program to fund

3264
02:04:46,140 --> 02:04:50,429
college scholarships through a marijuana

3265
02:04:47,670 --> 02:04:52,380
excise tax commissioner Sal pace says he

3266
02:04:50,429 --> 02:04:54,510
hopes the new measure will give webelo

3267
02:04:52,380 --> 02:04:56,369
kids a boost and help fight college debt

3268
02:04:54,510 --> 02:04:57,780
the County Commission is set to vote at

3269
02:04:56,369 --> 02:04:59,729
their Monday meeting on whether or not

3270
02:04:57,779 --> 02:05:02,399
the proposal will be placed on November

3271
02:04:59,729 --> 02:05:04,169
ballot elections the excise tax would be

3272
02:05:02,399 --> 02:05:06,988
levied when marijuana is transferred

3273
02:05:04,170 --> 02:05:09,390
from cultivation to a store Aces Office

3274
02:05:06,988 --> 02:05:10,559
said in a news release Wednesday he said

3275
02:05:09,390 --> 02:05:11,329
that Wednesday sorry I read that really

3276
02:05:10,560 --> 02:05:14,250
weird

3277
02:05:11,329 --> 02:05:15,960
Pablo counties perfect economic and

3278
02:05:14,250 --> 02:05:18,329
weather conditions have created a boom

3279
02:05:15,960 --> 02:05:19,939
of recreational cultivations without yet

3280
02:05:18,329 --> 02:05:23,429
generating a tax on these groves

3281
02:05:19,939 --> 02:05:24,809
beginning in 2017 graduating seniors

3282
02:05:23,429 --> 02:05:26,730
from all high schools and pueblos who

3283
02:05:24,810 --> 02:05:29,160
attend a public college or university in

3284
02:05:26,729 --> 02:05:30,899
Pueblo County will be eligible for

3285
02:05:29,159 --> 02:05:33,659
scholarships from the proposed program

3286
02:05:30,899 --> 02:05:35,879
that release said every kid deserves an

3287
02:05:33,659 --> 02:05:36,420
opportunity to succeed they said in a

3288
02:05:35,880 --> 02:05:38,550
statement

3289
02:05:36,420 --> 02:05:40,739
Pablo County has potential new tax

3290
02:05:38,550 --> 02:05:42,869
revenue from a marijuana industry that

3291
02:05:40,738 --> 02:05:44,339
can benefit the kids of pueblos the

3292
02:05:42,869 --> 02:05:46,260
ballot measure would propose a five

3293
02:05:44,340 --> 02:05:48,420
percent excise tax on recreational

3294
02:05:46,260 --> 02:05:51,030
marijuana grows from Pueblo County it

3295
02:05:48,420 --> 02:05:54,149
asks that on an annual basis no less

3296
02:05:51,029 --> 02:05:57,269
than 50% of tax revenue be designated

3297
02:05:54,149 --> 02:05:59,279
for scholarships fifty percent well if

3298
02:05:57,270 --> 02:06:00,600
you're doing it for this shouldn't a

3299
02:05:59,279 --> 02:06:03,359
hundred where's the other fifty going

3300
02:06:00,600 --> 02:06:05,460
Sal where is the other 50% going okay

3301
02:06:03,359 --> 02:06:07,799
the rest of the revenue would be used on

3302
02:06:05,460 --> 02:06:10,140
community projects like Colorado State

3303
02:06:07,800 --> 02:06:12,060
Fairs streetscape refurbishment medical

3304
02:06:10,140 --> 02:06:14,070
marijuana academic research and a

3305
02:06:12,060 --> 02:06:17,070
feasibility study on the potential

3306
02:06:14,069 --> 02:06:20,369
connection of Amtrak south and track

3307
02:06:17,069 --> 02:06:23,340
Southwest Chief to Pueblo and those all

3308
02:06:20,369 --> 02:06:24,988
sound like feasible options those seem

3309
02:06:23,340 --> 02:06:26,760
like they're worth some investment the

3310
02:06:24,988 --> 02:06:28,329
program may be expanded in future years

3311
02:06:26,760 --> 02:06:30,699
depending on revenue the really

3312
02:06:28,329 --> 02:06:32,050
said Tyler Henson president president of

3313
02:06:30,699 --> 02:06:33,729
the Colorado cannabis Chamber of

3314
02:06:32,050 --> 02:06:35,739
Commerce said he hopes the chin the

3315
02:06:33,729 --> 02:06:37,779
County Commission will fully examine the

3316
02:06:35,739 --> 02:06:40,269
measure before sending it to the ballot

3317
02:06:37,779 --> 02:06:42,009
under amendment 64 we gave local

3318
02:06:40,270 --> 02:06:44,590
governments two permission to make these

3319
02:06:42,010 --> 02:06:46,480
excise taxes he said I would just

3320
02:06:44,590 --> 02:06:48,430
caution the County Commissioners to look

3321
02:06:46,479 --> 02:06:51,069
at how this will affect sales in Pueblo

3322
02:06:48,430 --> 02:06:52,539
and be surrounding areas that's the

3323
02:06:51,069 --> 02:06:55,539
first thing I think of they're gonna add

3324
02:06:52,539 --> 02:06:58,090
5% more tax the tax is already really

3325
02:06:55,539 --> 02:07:00,010
high in Pueblo it's approximately 25

3326
02:06:58,090 --> 02:07:01,750
percent I don't know the exact

3327
02:07:00,010 --> 02:07:04,180
percentage to tell you the truth guys if

3328
02:07:01,750 --> 02:07:05,529
anybody on periscope maybe an emo Punk

3329
02:07:04,180 --> 02:07:07,480
if you want to throw up the actual

3330
02:07:05,529 --> 02:07:07,689
percentage of tax I'll say that on the

3331
02:07:07,479 --> 02:07:09,549
air

3332
02:07:07,689 --> 02:07:10,869
and I'll give you a shout-out also make

3333
02:07:09,550 --> 02:07:13,750
sure you guys follow my friend emo Punk

3334
02:07:10,869 --> 02:07:15,849
15 on Twitter he posts a lot of great

3335
02:07:13,750 --> 02:07:18,699
cannabis [ __ ] seventeen and a half

3336
02:07:15,850 --> 02:07:21,280
percent plus the 10 percent excise tax

3337
02:07:18,699 --> 02:07:22,720
that already exists so that's 27 percent

3338
02:07:21,279 --> 02:07:25,119
plus they're going to add another five

3339
02:07:22,720 --> 02:07:27,640
which will make it 32 percent excise tax

3340
02:07:25,119 --> 02:07:29,079
so this extra excise tax is just gonna

3341
02:07:27,640 --> 02:07:31,240
end up falling on the customer in the

3342
02:07:29,079 --> 02:07:33,609
end no matter how it works which is

3343
02:07:31,239 --> 02:07:36,699
going to make cannabis tax 32 percent

3344
02:07:33,609 --> 02:07:39,939
here in Pueblo which means it's gonna be

3345
02:07:36,699 --> 02:07:41,529
roughly $185 for a quarter of cannabis

3346
02:07:39,939 --> 02:07:44,229
which is ridiculous when you can go to

3347
02:07:41,529 --> 02:07:46,300
the street and you can get probably you

3348
02:07:44,229 --> 02:07:49,059
can get an ounce for that price on the

3349
02:07:46,300 --> 02:07:50,920
street you can get an ounce for $200 you

3350
02:07:49,060 --> 02:07:52,539
can get outs for 150 dollars on the

3351
02:07:50,920 --> 02:07:53,949
street and Pueblo Colorado so this is

3352
02:07:52,539 --> 02:07:56,439
going to turn around and put everybody

3353
02:07:53,949 --> 02:07:58,059
back at the black-market they're just

3354
02:07:56,439 --> 02:08:00,639
gonna ruin it they're trying to squeeze

3355
02:07:58,060 --> 02:08:01,960
too much blood out of one turnip I think

3356
02:08:00,640 --> 02:08:04,060
is what my grandma used to said trying

3357
02:08:01,960 --> 02:08:05,199
to squeeze blood out of a turnip I think

3358
02:08:04,060 --> 02:08:06,610
I think that's what these guys are

3359
02:08:05,199 --> 02:08:08,619
trying to do and they're gonna crash the

3360
02:08:06,609 --> 02:08:10,000
whole Marijuana thing all right you guys

3361
02:08:08,619 --> 02:08:11,649
I think that's enough podcast for this

3362
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:13,060
week I'm gonna wrap this up I'm gonna go

3448
02:15:52,390 --> 02:15:57,520
stuff like that but first I want to talk

3449
02:15:54,220 --> 02:15:58,930
about my weekend man I got to see my

3450
02:15:57,520 --> 02:16:00,520
favorite band if you guys know me you

3451
02:15:58,930 --> 02:16:02,110
know that my favorite band is Phish

3452
02:16:00,520 --> 02:16:03,760
I got to see - Phish shows over the

3453
02:16:02,109 --> 02:16:06,609
weekend I saw Saturday and Sunday night

3454
02:16:03,760 --> 02:16:09,820
at the Dick's Sporting Goods park in

3455
02:16:06,609 --> 02:16:12,489
Commerce City Colorado Saturday was a

3456
02:16:09,819 --> 02:16:13,929
pretty good show but sunday was a really

3457
02:16:12,489 --> 02:16:15,309
spectacular show they did some great

3458
02:16:13,930 --> 02:16:18,369
songs they did stuff they haven't played

3459
02:16:15,310 --> 02:16:19,720
in several years the band sounded great

3460
02:16:18,369 --> 02:16:22,390
the crowd was in a good mood everything

3461
02:16:19,720 --> 02:16:24,010
was amazing the only thing that kind of

3462
02:16:22,390 --> 02:16:26,079
sucked and it didn't suck really but my

3463
02:16:24,010 --> 02:16:27,489
favorite song from fish I think my

3464
02:16:26,079 --> 02:16:29,680
favorite song is called punch you in the

3465
02:16:27,489 --> 02:16:31,869
eye and the middle section of punch you

3466
02:16:29,680 --> 02:16:33,909
in the high is a jam that has been

3467
02:16:31,869 --> 02:16:34,659
labeled the landlady the landlady was

3468
02:16:33,909 --> 02:16:36,459
written first

3469
02:16:34,659 --> 02:16:38,110
punch you in the eye was written the

3470
02:16:36,459 --> 02:16:39,939
landlady was dropped into the middle of

3471
02:16:38,110 --> 02:16:42,489
punch you in the eyes the groove portion

3472
02:16:39,940 --> 02:16:45,010
and it's always been played as one piece

3473
02:16:42,489 --> 02:16:47,260
since then but on Sunday night they

3474
02:16:45,010 --> 02:16:49,120
opened with the landlady which is the

3475
02:16:47,260 --> 02:16:50,800
middle section of my favorite song so it

3476
02:16:49,120 --> 02:16:52,390
was a little disappointing knowing that

3477
02:16:50,799 --> 02:16:54,369
I wasn't gonna hear my favorite song

3478
02:16:52,389 --> 02:16:55,869
through the whole weekend but it was

3479
02:16:54,370 --> 02:16:57,760
okay because they made up for it by

3480
02:16:55,870 --> 02:16:59,050
playing some like I said some old songs

3481
02:16:57,760 --> 02:17:00,280
that I haven't heard in a long time and

3482
02:16:59,049 --> 02:17:02,649
stuff that they have not played in

3483
02:17:00,280 --> 02:17:05,950
several years if anybody hears a Phish

3484
02:17:02,649 --> 02:17:07,359
fan they played hard puah that means a

3485
02:17:05,950 --> 02:17:09,010
lot to people if you're a fish man they

3486
02:17:07,360 --> 02:17:10,510
don't play her pool very often and when

3487
02:17:09,010 --> 02:17:12,280
they do play hard pool it's a really

3488
02:17:10,510 --> 02:17:13,600
great thing so that's enough rambling

3489
02:17:12,280 --> 02:17:15,670
about the fish concert I had a great

3490
02:17:13,600 --> 02:17:16,929
time big shout out to fish they put on a

3491
02:17:15,670 --> 02:17:19,000

3492
02:17:16,929 --> 02:17:21,340

3493
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:23,079

3494

3495
02:17:23,079 --> 02:17:26,468

3515
02:17:59,079 --> 02:18:02,350
take a lot of dabs on the show so

3516
02:18:00,549 --> 02:18:04,899

02:21:57,398 --> 02:22:00,818
dab all right I've been talking about

3634
02:21:59,500 --> 02:22:02,290
some news articles and I've been

3635
02:22:00,818 --> 02:22:05,228
rambling for a few minutes so let's open

3636
02:22:02,290 --> 02:22:06,790
up these news articles and just to uh

3637
02:22:05,228 --> 02:22:08,079
just for a disclaimer I know that

3638
02:22:06,790 --> 02:22:09,760
earlier in the future in the past

3639
02:22:08,079 --> 02:22:11,950
episode I said that I was gonna get more

3640
02:22:09,760 --> 02:22:13,389
into grow lessons I will do that I have

3641
02:22:11,950 --> 02:22:15,340
been doing that I've got a lot of stuff

3642
02:22:13,389 --> 02:22:17,709
coming up I've got a CBD episode coming

3643
02:22:15,340 --> 02:22:19,210
up I've got a few episodes in the works

3644
02:22:17,709 --> 02:22:20,919
that are partial episodes I'm taking

3645
02:22:19,209 --> 02:22:22,898
notes and getting [ __ ] ready but there

3646
02:22:20,920 --> 02:22:24,609
has been so much news that I feel it's

3647
02:22:22,898 --> 02:22:28,059
my responsibility to bring this news to

3648
02:22:24,609 --> 02:22:30,609
you so here comes the first news article

3649
02:22:28,059 --> 02:22:32,829
I found this article on the cannabis and

3650
02:22:30,609 --> 02:22:35,409
it was written by John Murray of the

3651
02:22:32,829 --> 02:22:37,209
Denver Post the headline says Denver's

3652
02:22:35,409 --> 02:22:39,459
social pot use plans are getting

3653
02:22:37,209 --> 02:22:41,469
overhauled the subway headline says the

3654
02:22:39,459 --> 02:22:43,148
idea isn't dead backers of the proposal

3655
02:22:41,469 --> 02:22:45,250
say they will join talks with city and

3656
02:22:43,148 --> 02:22:47,939
business leaders to try to work out a

3657
02:22:45,250 --> 02:22:50,170
compromise so the article goes like this

3658
02:22:47,939 --> 02:22:51,760
activists behind a proposed Denver

3659
02:22:50,170 --> 02:22:53,170
ballot initiative to allow some

3660
02:22:51,760 --> 02:22:55,000
marijuana use in bars and other

3661
02:22:53,170 --> 02:22:57,219
businesses say they will pull them

3662
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:59,829
The Denver Post has confirmed their new

3663
02:22:57,219 --> 02:23:02,260
goal drafting a compromise measure with

3664
02:22:59,829 --> 02:23:03,579
city and business leaders the verbal

3665
02:23:02,260 --> 02:23:05,500
agreement with a group that includes

3666
02:23:03,579 --> 02:23:07,510
city attorney Scott Martinez averts a

3667
02:23:05,500 --> 02:23:08,799
public vote in November when they might

3668
02:23:07,510 --> 02:23:10,510
have allowed more extensive pot

3669
02:23:08,799 --> 02:23:13,149
consumption in publicly accessible

3670
02:23:10,510 --> 02:23:14,940
places than city officials and some

3671
02:23:13,149 --> 02:23:16,930
business leaders were comfortable with

3672
02:23:14,940 --> 02:23:19,000
Mason divert of the Marijuana Policy

3673
02:23:16,930 --> 02:23:20,889
Project said fellow backers of the

3674
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:23,049
limited social cannabis use initiative

3675
02:23:20,889 --> 02:23:25,029
plan to announce the withdrawal Thursday

3676
02:23:23,049 --> 02:23:27,219
before Friday's expected certification

3677
02:23:25,030 --> 02:23:29,800
of the measure for the November third

3678
02:23:27,219 --> 02:23:31,299
ballot activists now will shift to

3679
02:23:29,799 --> 02:23:32,319
working with city officials and the

3680
02:23:31,299 --> 02:23:34,209
state restaurant and Lodging

3681
02:23:32,319 --> 02:23:35,619
associations to work out an ordinance

3682
02:23:34,209 --> 02:23:37,119
that they hope will be considered by the

3683
02:23:35,620 --> 02:23:39,910
Denver Council or by the City Council

3684
02:23:37,120 --> 02:23:41,380
excuse me within the next year the

3685
02:23:39,909 --> 02:23:43,450
downtown Denver partnership which

3686
02:23:41,379 --> 02:23:45,399
represents business interests in that

3687
02:23:43,450 --> 02:23:47,230
area also plans to take part

3688
02:23:45,399 --> 02:23:48,850
we're not approaching the withdrawal of

3689
02:23:47,229 --> 02:23:51,159
this initiative lightly said divert who

3690
02:23:48,850 --> 02:23:53,229
also was a co-author of Colorado's

3691
02:23:51,159 --> 02:23:55,719
marijuana legalizing amendment 64 in

3692
02:23:53,229 --> 02:23:58,629
2012 we believe that cannabis users

3693
02:23:55,719 --> 02:23:59,139
derive deserve the freedom and let me

3694
02:23:58,629 --> 02:24:01,659
try that again

3695
02:23:59,139 --> 02:24:03,489
we believe that cannabis users deserve

3696
02:24:01,659 --> 02:24:05,889
the freedom to congregate and socialize

3697
02:24:03,489 --> 02:24:07,510
to the same extent as alcohol users any

3698
02:24:05,889 --> 02:24:09,309
guys I'm gonna interject here when we

3699
02:24:07,510 --> 02:24:11,739
set up this cannabis system that we have

3700
02:24:09,309 --> 02:24:14,649
the whole model they modeled it after

3701
02:24:11,739 --> 02:24:16,840
was to make it like alcohol they wanted

3702
02:24:14,649 --> 02:24:19,119
to regulate it like alcohol and we're

3703
02:24:16,840 --> 02:24:21,159
all able to go to so many places and

3704
02:24:19,120 --> 02:24:22,900
drink alcohol all night long why aren't

3705
02:24:21,159 --> 02:24:24,610
there a few places for us to go and take

3706
02:24:22,899 --> 02:24:26,409
some dabs and smoke some flowers and

3707
02:24:24,610 --> 02:24:27,970
hang out with our friends we don't

3708
02:24:26,409 --> 02:24:29,289
always have to be at my house sitting at

3709
02:24:27,969 --> 02:24:31,719
the dab table we should be able to go

3710
02:24:29,290 --> 02:24:33,490
somewhere else there are so many stoners

3711
02:24:31,719 --> 02:24:34,809
out there that I don't know because

3712
02:24:33,489 --> 02:24:36,670
they're all at their house on their

3713
02:24:34,809 --> 02:24:38,199
couch taking dabs cuz they don't come to

3714
02:24:36,670 --> 02:24:40,149
my house and sit on my couch and take

3715
02:24:38,200 --> 02:24:42,310
dabs so we're never gonna meet if we had

3716
02:24:40,149 --> 02:24:43,779
a social club we'd go meet each other so

3717
02:24:42,309 --> 02:24:45,519
that way when somebody got tired of

3718
02:24:43,780 --> 02:24:47,020
smoking what am i smoking if I got tired

3719
02:24:45,520 --> 02:24:48,489
of smoking can't be cush I could go

3720
02:24:47,020 --> 02:24:50,530
trade them I can't be cush for some of

3721
02:24:48,489 --> 02:24:51,850
their OG Kush or whatever I'm just

3722
02:24:50,530 --> 02:24:53,680
making a nice little community a nice

3723
02:24:51,850 --> 02:24:56,559
little network I'm gonna keep on with

3724
02:24:53,680 --> 02:24:57,880
the article it says they found ready

3725
02:24:56,559 --> 02:25:00,309
support in the ballot petitioning

3726
02:24:57,879 --> 02:25:01,689
process turning in ten thousand seven

3727
02:25:00,309 --> 02:25:02,680
hundred signatures more than twice as

3728
02:25:01,690 --> 02:25:04,000
many as needed

3729
02:25:02,680 --> 02:25:05,620
although Denver police have shut down

3730
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:07,510
private cannabis clubs of the city's

3731
02:25:05,620 --> 02:25:08,140
Marijuana Policy office this year began

3732
02:25:07,510 --> 02:25:10,238
examining

3733
02:25:08,139 --> 02:25:12,129
as an evolving regulatory mean to the

3734
02:25:10,238 --> 02:25:12,818
potential of allowing some social use of

3735
02:25:12,129 --> 02:25:14,799
marijuana

3736
02:25:12,818 --> 02:25:16,840
the idea came up in council race lap

3737
02:25:14,799 --> 02:25:18,728
races last spring with some successful

3738
02:25:16,840 --> 02:25:20,590
candidates open to the idea in part

3739
02:25:18,728 --> 02:25:23,079
because tourists lack places to consume

3740
02:25:20,590 --> 02:25:24,818
their purchases legally that's very true

3741
02:25:23,079 --> 02:25:26,109
you guys you can come to Colorado and if

3742
02:25:24,818 --> 02:25:27,698
you're not from here if you've got an

3743
02:25:26,109 --> 02:25:29,620
out-of-state license you can purchase up

3744
02:25:27,699 --> 02:25:31,870
to 7 grams of cannabis you can purchase

3745
02:25:29,620 --> 02:25:33,909
up to 7 grams of hash you can purchase

3746
02:25:31,870 --> 02:25:36,819
seven grams total in any combination of

3747
02:25:33,908 --> 02:25:38,079
edibles hash tinctures and topicals but

3748
02:25:36,818 --> 02:25:39,969
what you can't do once you've made the

3749
02:25:38,079 --> 02:25:41,799
purchase there's nowhere to [ __ ]

3750
02:25:39,969 --> 02:25:42,969
smoke you can't go to the hotel and

3751
02:25:41,799 --> 02:25:44,920
smoke because they don't allow smoking

3752
02:25:42,969 --> 02:25:45,429
you can't go to the park because that's

3753
02:25:44,920 --> 02:25:47,920
illegal

3754
02:25:45,430 --> 02:25:49,329
unless you know somebody you just have

3755
02:25:47,920 --> 02:25:50,559
all this cannabis that you can't smoke

3756
02:25:49,329 --> 02:25:52,029
and you're not allowed to take it to

3757
02:25:50,559 --> 02:25:53,439
your home state to smoke it because it's

3758
02:25:52,029 --> 02:25:56,140
illegal to travel across state lines

3759
02:25:53,439 --> 02:25:57,729
with it so I think that this smoking

3760
02:25:56,139 --> 02:25:59,170
lounge type of an environment is

3761
02:25:57,728 --> 02:26:00,938
something that we really really need

3762
02:25:59,170 --> 02:26:03,129
I'll continue with the article that says

3763
02:26:00,939 --> 02:26:05,318
but city efforts were in early stages

3764
02:26:03,129 --> 02:26:07,119
went Evert and brand facin T of cannabis

3765
02:26:05,318 --> 02:26:09,369
focused law firm vicente sinner burg

3766
02:26:07,120 --> 02:26:12,029
both frustrated with what they saw as an

3767
02:26:09,370 --> 02:26:14,620
action began to push for the initiative

3768
02:26:12,029 --> 02:26:16,300
to virt and several people involved in

3769
02:26:14,620 --> 02:26:18,250
the recent talk say it's too soon to

3770
02:26:16,299 --> 02:26:19,629
predict what will result options could

3771
02:26:18,250 --> 02:26:21,728
range from a narrow ordinance allows

3772
02:26:19,629 --> 02:26:23,259
private clubs to a more extensive law

3773
02:26:21,728 --> 02:26:25,238
that would break new ground in colorado

3774
02:26:23,260 --> 02:26:27,488
by allowing patrons of some bars to vape

3775
02:26:25,238 --> 02:26:30,039
inside or smoke outside as the

3776
02:26:27,488 --> 02:26:32,350
initiative proposed the initiative

3777
02:26:30,040 --> 02:26:34,180
withdrawal ensures we now have the time

3778
02:26:32,350 --> 02:26:36,040
and ability to include all interested

3779
02:26:34,180 --> 02:26:37,750
stakeholders to reach consensus on this

3780
02:26:36,040 --> 02:26:40,149
important issue said councilman Albus

3781
02:26:37,750 --> 02:26:42,430
Brooks who represents most of downtown

3782
02:26:40,148 --> 02:26:44,559
I'm committed to working on a broadly

3783
02:26:42,430 --> 02:26:46,180
acceptable solution but finding common

3784
02:26:44,559 --> 02:26:47,829
ground for an expansion of the current

3785
02:26:46,180 --> 02:26:50,170
law which restricts consumption mostly

3786
02:26:47,829 --> 02:26:52,840
to private residents might prove tricky

3787
02:26:50,170 --> 02:26:54,309
there's also the chance that a consensus

3788
02:26:52,840 --> 02:26:56,790
proposal won't go far enough for the

3789
02:26:54,309 --> 02:26:59,289
activists while Mayor Michael Hancock

3790
02:26:56,790 --> 02:27:00,939
administration took no position on the

3791
02:26:59,290 --> 02:27:02,680
proposed initiative the City Attorney's

3792
02:27:00,939 --> 02:27:04,658
Office questioned the legality of its

3793
02:27:02,680 --> 02:27:06,520
scope even state laws against public

3794
02:27:04,658 --> 02:27:09,398
consumption that its lawyers viewed as

3795
02:27:06,520 --> 02:27:11,319
conflicting and Sonya Riggs president

3796
02:27:09,398 --> 02:27:13,568
and CEO of the Colorado Restaurant

3797
02:27:11,318 --> 02:27:15,639
Association expressed adamant opposition

3798
02:27:13,568 --> 02:27:17,379
on behalf of about half of the state's

3799
02:27:15,639 --> 02:27:19,278
restaurants in part based on concerns

3800
02:27:17,379 --> 02:27:20,809
that insurers might drop coverage of

3801
02:27:19,279 --> 02:27:23,270
all restaurants because of liability

3802
02:27:20,809 --> 02:27:25,248
concerns this week the Colorado Hotel

3803
02:27:23,270 --> 02:27:27,260
and Lodging Association metro Denver

3804
02:27:25,248 --> 02:27:28,850
lodging Council and Colorado Restaurant

3805
02:27:27,260 --> 02:27:31,068
Association said in a statement that

3806
02:27:28,850 --> 02:27:32,988
they appreciated the activist withdrawal

3807
02:27:31,068 --> 02:27:34,548
of the initiative our respective

3808
02:27:32,988 --> 02:27:36,618
industries are committed to working with

3809
02:27:34,549 --> 02:27:38,089
the promote the proponents and the city

3810
02:27:36,619 --> 02:27:39,498
to find a solution that reflects the

3811
02:27:38,088 --> 02:27:41,318
interests and concerns of all

3812
02:27:39,498 --> 02:27:43,548
stakeholders their statement said the

3813
02:27:41,318 --> 02:27:45,260
proposed initiative divided Denver

3814
02:27:43,549 --> 02:27:46,970
restaurant and bar owners who would have

3815
02:27:45,260 --> 02:27:48,859
had the option to allow marijuana use

3816
02:27:46,969 --> 02:27:50,269
riggs said Wednesday that she would

3817
02:27:48,859 --> 02:27:50,689
approach the discussion with an open

3818
02:27:50,270 --> 02:27:52,459
mind

3819
02:27:50,689 --> 02:27:54,229
I do understand there's a concern from

3820
02:27:52,459 --> 02:27:55,850
their part that they need to have that

3821
02:27:54,228 --> 02:27:57,798
they need to have addressed she said of

3822
02:27:55,850 --> 02:28:00,379
initiative backers just as there's a

3823
02:27:57,799 --> 02:28:01,760
concern from our side for their part

3824
02:28:00,379 --> 02:28:03,649
city officials say they can't offer

3825
02:28:01,760 --> 02:28:04,850
assurances they also plan to gather

3826
02:28:03,648 --> 02:28:07,068
input from neighborhood and community

3827
02:28:04,850 --> 02:28:09,078
groups on the issue we can't guarantee

3828
02:28:07,068 --> 02:28:10,430
an outcome on it obviously but it's

3829
02:28:09,078 --> 02:28:12,318
something we've been looking at said

3830
02:28:10,430 --> 02:28:14,328
Ashley Kilroy Hancock's executive

3831
02:28:12,318 --> 02:28:15,918
director for Marijuana Policy we do

3832
02:28:14,328 --> 02:28:17,328
believe that there's area for a

3833
02:28:15,918 --> 02:28:18,969
conversation around this and that

3834
02:28:17,328 --> 02:28:21,078
there's a lot of other considerations

3835
02:28:18,969 --> 02:28:22,818
Martinez said his office isn't drawing

3836
02:28:21,078 --> 02:28:25,279
bright lines allowing policymakers to

3837
02:28:22,818 --> 02:28:26,838
consider all options first I'm not going

3838
02:28:25,279 --> 02:28:29,988
to throw down the legal hammer until we

3839
02:28:26,838 --> 02:28:31,488
were specific proposals he said until

3840
02:28:29,988 --> 02:28:33,439
there are specific proposals he said

3841
02:28:31,488 --> 02:28:36,228
sorry the word proposals is out of the

3842
02:28:33,439 --> 02:28:37,970
quotations so that was confusing until

3843
02:28:36,228 --> 02:28:39,528
our specific proposals he said adding

3844
02:28:37,969 --> 02:28:41,478
we're all working to find clarity within

3845
02:28:39,529 --> 02:28:43,908
the law so that people can operate with

3846
02:28:41,478 --> 02:28:45,048
certainty if activists are dissatisfied

3847
02:28:43,908 --> 02:28:47,328
with the coming decisions though they

3848
02:28:45,049 --> 02:28:49,549
will have a fallback option going back

3849
02:28:47,328 --> 02:28:51,708
to the ballot on their own next year at

3850
02:28:49,549 --> 02:28:53,569
a presidential election that probably

3851
02:28:51,709 --> 02:28:55,760
will have wider turnout than this fall

3852
02:28:53,568 --> 02:28:57,798
divert sees an even greater change for

3853
02:28:55,760 --> 02:28:59,600
passage but he said a successful

3854
02:28:57,799 --> 02:29:02,510
compromise with city officials and other

3855
02:28:59,600 --> 02:29:04,640
interests has more likely to result in a

3856
02:29:02,510 --> 02:29:06,498
law that we know the city would be

3857
02:29:04,639 --> 02:29:09,948
comfortable with and will not resist and

3858
02:29:06,498 --> 02:29:12,260
will actually implement so they pulled

3859
02:29:09,949 --> 02:29:13,609
their ballot so that they can rewrite it

3860
02:29:12,260 --> 02:29:16,189
where they can actually make it a little

3861
02:29:13,609 --> 02:29:18,078
bit more fair for the businesses and for

3862
02:29:16,189 --> 02:29:20,389
the people who want to consume so the

3863
02:29:18,078 --> 02:29:21,978
law or the proposal is not dead they're

3864
02:29:20,389 --> 02:29:24,288
going to rewrite it and they're gonna

3865
02:29:21,978 --> 02:29:26,328
try again it sounds like the city of

3866
02:29:24,289 --> 02:29:28,699
Denver wants to work with the cannabis

3867
02:29:26,328 --> 02:29:31,219
consumers it seems like the understand

3868
02:29:28,699 --> 02:29:32,640
of the revenue that is available they

3869
02:29:31,219 --> 02:29:34,170
understand the need

3870
02:29:32,640 --> 02:29:35,671
and they mentioned in this article that

3871
02:29:34,171 --> 02:29:37,950
out-of-staters don't have anywhere to

3872
02:29:35,671 --> 02:29:39,390
consume which is the main problem here

3873
02:29:37,950 --> 02:29:41,280
if those out-of-staters had somewhere to

3874
02:29:39,390 --> 02:29:42,810
consume they would go there they would

3875
02:29:41,280 --> 02:29:44,190
consume and then they're gonna get

3876
02:29:42,810 --> 02:29:45,181
hungry they're gonna get thirsty and

3877
02:29:44,190 --> 02:29:48,149
they're going to need entertainment

3878
02:29:45,181 --> 02:29:49,980
which is going to cause them or and not

3879
02:29:48,149 --> 02:29:52,140
cause them but yeah will cause them to

3880
02:29:49,979 --> 02:29:54,421
go spend more money and participate in

3881
02:29:52,140 --> 02:29:56,819
our economy and be part of our state's

3882
02:29:54,421 --> 02:29:58,200
cash flow a little better all right guys

3883

bit nasally this week I'm catching a

3888
02:30:04,681 --> 02:30:07,440
little bit of a head cold I'm trying to

3889
02:30:05,940 --> 02:30:09,541
fight it off but like any other

3890
02:30:07,440 --> 02:30:11,761

3897
02:30:20,960 --> 02:30:25,560
celebration this may become a holiday in

3898
02:30:24,030 --> 02:30:28,530
Colorado if they continue to do this

3899
02:30:25,560 --> 02:30:30,751
annually the article here came from the

3900
02:30:28,530 --> 02:30:33,001
cannabis and it was written by Kristen

3901
02:30:30,751 --> 02:30:35,640
Wyatt from The Associated Press and the

3902
02:30:33,001 --> 02:30:39,001
headline says get ready for the one day

3903
02:30:35,640 --> 02:30:40,290
tax holiday on Colorado weed excuse me

3904

3905
02:30:40,290 --> 02:30:46,199
get the show on the road all right so

3906
02:30:44,819 --> 02:30:47,819
the sub headline says we're thinking

3907
02:30:46,200 --> 02:30:49,950
there will be huge crowds says a shop

3908
02:30:47,819 --> 02:30:52,140
owner about the September 16 break on

3909
02:30:49,950 --> 02:30:53,851
the hefty Colorado marijuana tax on

3910
02:30:52,140 --> 02:30:56,699
recreational weed thanks to the tabor

3911
02:30:53,851 --> 02:30:58,980
law all right so that sounds confusing

3912
02:30:56,700 --> 02:31:00,511
to a lot of people but taxes are

3913
02:30:58,979 --> 02:31:03,390
ridiculously high on cannabis here in

3914
02:31:00,511 --> 02:31:06,659
Colorado and we're going to have a 1-day

3915
02:31:03,390 --> 02:31:08,001
tax free cannabis day in Colorado let me

3916
02:31:06,659 --> 02:31:10,470
read the article I'll explain it to you

3917
02:31:08,001 --> 02:31:12,331
Colorado's unusual tax laws forcing the

3918
02:31:10,470 --> 02:31:14,761
state to suspend taxes on recreational

3919
02:31:12,331 --> 02:31:16,890
marijuana for one day the sales tax

3920
02:31:14,761 --> 02:31:19,140
break down the sales tax break on

3921
02:31:16,890 --> 02:31:20,069
September 16th will save $20 off the

3922
02:31:19,140 --> 02:31:21,989
prices of a mid-grade

3923
02:31:20,069 --> 02:31:24,270
ounce of pot in the Denver area where

3924
02:31:21,989 --> 02:31:27,060
ounces this summer sell for about $200

3925
02:31:24,271 --> 02:31:29,041
before tax it's unusual for a state that

3926
02:31:27,060 --> 02:31:30,511
has many times rejected sales tax

3927
02:31:29,040 --> 02:31:32,670
holidays on things like school supplies

3928
02:31:30,511 --> 02:31:35,041
clothing or any of energy efficient

3929
02:31:32,671 --> 02:31:38,041
appliances officials say it could cost

3930
02:31:35,040 --> 02:31:40,109
the state 3 to 4 million dollars in one

3931
02:31:38,040 --> 02:31:42,149
day you guys they're going to lose 3 to

3932
02:31:40,110 --> 02:31:43,220
4 million dollars in taxes in a single

3933
02:31:42,149 --> 02:31:45,949
day

3934
02:31:43,219 --> 02:31:47,809
article goes on to say at first I was in

3935
02:31:45,950 --> 02:31:49,370
disbelief we were doing this said Cheri

3936
02:31:47,809 --> 02:31:50,898

3937

3942
02:31:58,939 --> 02:32:03,050

3944
02:32:03,049 --> 02:32:06,469

3946
02:32:06,469 --> 02:32:10,938
inventory for a one-day crush of

3947
02:32:08,510 --> 02:32:12,648
businesses Colorado's taxpayer Bill of

3948
02:32:10,939 --> 02:32:15,800
Rights requires voter approval for new

3949
02:32:12,648 --> 02:32:18,019
taxes in 2013 a year after legalizing

3950
02:32:15,799 --> 02:32:20,059
recreational pot voters approved the 25

3951
02:32:18,020 --> 02:32:22,130
percent taxes but the law requires that

3952
02:32:20,059 --> 02:32:23,568
any new taxes be waived and refunded if

3953
02:32:22,129 --> 02:32:25,369
overall State collections exceed

3954
02:32:23,568 --> 02:32:28,010
projections given to voters when they

3955
02:32:25,370 --> 02:32:29,899
approved the new taxes in this case the

3956
02:32:28,010 --> 02:32:32,719
pot taxes were projected to raise 70

3957
02:32:29,898 --> 02:32:35,090
million dollars in 2014 they actually

3958
02:32:32,719 --> 02:32:36,679
raised 58 million dollars but because

3959
02:32:35,090 --> 02:32:38,898
overall tax collections that year

3960
02:32:36,680 --> 02:32:40,850
exceeded predicted projections Colorado

3961
02:32:38,898 --> 02:32:42,619
must ask voters for permission to keep

3962
02:32:40,850 --> 02:32:44,420
the money and it comply with the

3963
02:32:42,620 --> 02:32:46,579
requirement that the taxes revert to

3964
02:32:44,420 --> 02:32:49,969
zero lawmakers settled on a short one

3965
02:32:46,579 --> 02:32:53,600
day tax waiver that day is September

3966
02:32:49,969 --> 02:32:55,579
16th one day after the state's books for

3967
02:32:53,600 --> 02:32:56,809
the previous fiscal year are made final

3968
02:32:55,579 --> 02:32:59,389
all right so if you guys want to come to

3969
02:32:56,809 --> 02:33:01,488
Colorado and buy a quarter of cannabis

3970
02:32:59,389 --> 02:33:03,909
at a shop September 16th would be your

3971
02:33:01,488 --> 02:33:06,109
day to do it there will be no taxes

3972
02:33:03,909 --> 02:33:08,420
marijuana won't be completely tax free

3973
02:33:06,109 --> 02:33:10,488
that day a regular 2.9 percent sales tax

3974
02:33:08,420 --> 02:33:13,670
still applies as do medical marijuana

3975
02:33:10,488 --> 02:33:16,430
taxes and local pot taxes all right so

3976
02:33:13,670 --> 02:33:18,228
the extra local taxes that we pay here

3977
02:33:16,430 --> 02:33:20,420
in pueblo will still be tacked on for

3978
02:33:18,228 --> 02:33:22,219
pot retailers the holiday poses a

3979
02:33:20,420 --> 02:33:24,079
bizarre supply dilemma don't want plenty

3980
02:33:22,219 --> 02:33:25,818
of wheat on hand to sell to throngs of

3981
02:33:24,079 --> 02:33:27,439
pot shoppers but if they stock too much

3982
02:33:25,818 --> 02:33:29,809
product they'll forego their one-day

3983
02:33:27,439 --> 02:33:32,630
waiver on the 15% excise tax they pay

3984
02:33:29,809 --> 02:33:33,949
marijuana wholesalers a savvy retailer

3985
02:33:32,629 --> 02:33:35,629
would want to have shelves full enough

3986
02:33:33,950 --> 02:33:37,310
to supply crowds but bare enough to take

3987
02:33:35,629 --> 02:33:39,769
maximum of an advantage of the

3988
02:33:37,309 --> 02:33:42,549
restocking without paying excise taxes

3989
02:33:39,770 --> 02:33:44,750
before the business closes September 16

3990
02:33:42,549 --> 02:33:46,549
Ryan Fox who owns two denver

3991
02:33:44,750 --> 02:33:48,260
dispensaries and also a wholesale

3992
02:33:46,549 --> 02:33:49,818
partnering company hasn't decided what

3993
02:33:48,260 --> 02:33:52,130
sorts of deals to offer that day but

3994
02:33:49,818 --> 02:33:53,568
he's anticipating a windfall our hopes

3995
02:33:52,129 --> 02:33:55,429
are high and we're going to push as hard

3996
02:33:53,568 --> 02:33:56,189
as we can to see as many customers as we

3997
02:33:55,430 --> 02:33:58,739
can

3998
02:33:56,190 --> 02:34:01,500
Colorado voters will decide in November

3999
02:33:58,739 --> 02:34:03,271
whether to keep the pot taxes the 2013

4000
02:34:01,500 --> 02:34:05,011
taxing measure passed two-to-one and

4001
02:34:03,271 --> 02:34:07,351
state politicians seemed confident

4002
02:34:05,011 --> 02:34:09,271
voters will reauthorize the taxes the

4003
02:34:07,351 --> 02:34:12,421
state constitution requires refunds only

4004
02:34:09,271 --> 02:34:14,851
in a new tax and in new taxes first year

4005
02:34:12,421 --> 02:34:15,989
so voters won't be asked again all right

4006
02:34:14,851 --> 02:34:19,141
I read that a little weird so I'm gonna

4007
02:34:15,989 --> 02:34:21,239
read that last line again it says the

4008
02:34:19,140 --> 02:34:24,000
state constitution requires refunds only

4009
02:34:21,239 --> 02:34:25,979
any new taxes first year so voters won't

4010
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:27,780
be asked again I kind of read that funny

4011
02:34:25,979 --> 02:34:30,000
the first time but this only comes up

4012
02:34:27,780 --> 02:34:31,980
when a tax is in its first year so they

4013
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:33,780
won't be asking us this again the one

4014
02:34:31,979 --> 02:34:35,341
day tax break won't put too much of a

4015
02:34:33,780 --> 02:34:37,351
dent in the state's overall pot revenue

4016
02:34:35,341 --> 02:34:39,841
Colorado's pot collections are blooming

4017
02:34:37,351 --> 02:34:41,761

4018
02:34:39,841 --> 02:34:45,091
25 million in the first five months of

4019
02:34:41,761 --> 02:34:47,011
2014 to 44 million in the first five

4020
02:34:45,091 --> 02:34:48,899
months of this year the increase has

4021
02:34:47,011 --> 02:34:51,841
been attributed to additional stores

4022
02:34:48,899 --> 02:34:55,171
opening Colorado now has 380

4023

4028
02:35:05,011 --> 02:35:10,021

we have to give our state a tax break

4035

Wednesday pesticides typically are

4141
02:38:55,129 --> 02:38:58,789
applied while a plant is growing not

4142
02:38:57,079 --> 02:39:00,771
after it has been harvested dried and

sold the post investigation found

4144
02:39:00,771 --> 02:39:04,340
mahatma had inadvertently mislabeled its

4145
02:39:02,899 --> 02:39:05,989
products to indicate the concentrate

4146
02:39:04,340 --> 02:39:07,940
came from plants it had grown the

4147
02:39:05,989 --> 02:39:09,459
pesticides were not included in the

products labels list of ingredients

4149
02:39:09,459 --> 02:39:14,390
state law requires labels to reflect any

4150
02:39:12,140 --> 02:39:16,190
pesticide or herbicide or a contaminant

4151
02:39:14,390 --> 02:39:18,799
that was used at any stage of a

4152
02:39:16,190 --> 02:39:20,840
marijuana products processing though the

4153
02:39:18,799 --> 02:39:22,699
law also requires cannabis businesses to

4154
02:39:20,840 --> 02:39:25,761
test for pesticides that provision has

4155
02:39:22,700 --> 02:39:28,011
not yet been enforced Mouser previously

4156
02:39:25,761 --> 02:39:29,690
said the businesses labels are only as

4157
02:39:28,011 --> 02:39:31,790
accurate as the information provided to

4158
02:39:29,690 --> 02:39:33,620
them we're going by what our clients

4159
02:39:31,790 --> 02:39:35,271
give us as far as an ingredient list he

4160
02:39:33,620 --> 02:39:37,090
told the post we go over the ingredients

4161
02:39:35,271 --> 02:39:39,829
list and we check that list again

4162
02:39:37,090 --> 02:39:41,601
against the approved pesticides list if

4163
02:39:39,829 --> 02:39:44,450
we find something that isn't on the list

4164
02:39:41,601 --> 02:39:46,159
we notified the processing client the

4165
02:39:44,450 --> 02:39:48,110
pesticides found in the post test are

4166
02:39:46,159 --> 02:39:49,670
among hundreds of Colorado Department of

Agriculture

4168
02:39:49,670 --> 02:39:53,299
has not approved for use on marijuana

4169
02:39:51,709 --> 02:39:55,699
because product labels restrict their

4170

use to certain plant and crops or to

4171
02:39:55,700 --> 02:39:59,810
specific locations such as open fields

4172
02:39:57,680 --> 02:40:01,309
and residential Gardens because

4173
02:39:59,809 --> 02:40:03,289
marijuana is illegal under federal law

4174
02:40:01,309 --> 02:40:05,329
the US Environmental Protection Agency

4175
02:40:03,290 --> 02:40:08,090
will not certify any pesticide for use

4176
02:40:05,329 --> 02:40:09,770
on cannabis nor allow any testing as a

4177
02:40:08,090 --> 02:40:11,750
result there are no safety limits

4178
02:40:09,770 --> 02:40:14,180
established for their use specific to

4179
02:40:11,750 --> 02:40:16,219
cannabis or their ingestion by consumers

4180
02:40:14,180 --> 02:40:18,020
however the products are allowed on

4181
02:40:16,219 --> 02:40:19,938
other consumable items such as

4182
02:40:18,020 --> 02:40:21,920
strawberries tomatoes and grapes though

4183
02:40:19,939 --> 02:40:24,590
the level of pesticide residues allowed

4184
02:40:21,920 --> 02:40:27,020
on each does vary the Post found

4185
02:40:24,590 --> 02:40:29,059
pesticides levels Ejim us as much as six

4186
02:40:27,020 --> 02:40:32,060
times the highest amount allowed on an

4187
02:40:29,059 --> 02:40:33,920
edible food product and as high as 1,800

4188
02:40:32,059 --> 02:40:36,049
times the level Denver officials allowed

4189
02:40:33,920 --> 02:40:38,329
to be on release plants at hand core it

4190
02:40:36,049 --> 02:40:42,079
had quarantined earlier this year over

4191
02:40:38,329 --> 02:40:44,989
pesticide concerns this plant had 1,800

4192
02:40:42,079 --> 02:40:47,270
times the level that Denver allowed to

4193
02:40:44,989 --> 02:40:49,369
be released this plant had been sprayed

4194
02:40:47,270 --> 02:40:50,689
to [ __ ] whatever they were whatever

4195
02:40:49,370 --> 02:40:52,370
material they use these guys were

4196
02:40:50,689 --> 02:40:55,189
spraying the [ __ ] out of it all the time

4197
02:40:52,370 --> 02:40:56,120
and way too concentrated this is crazy I

4198
02:40:55,189 --> 02:40:57,350
don't know what kind of bugs they were

4199
02:40:56,120 --> 02:40:59,329
trying to treat for but they are not

4200
02:40:57,350 --> 02:41:00,890
quality farmers I'll go on with the

4201
02:40:59,329 --> 02:41:02,569
article it says enforcement of the

4202
02:41:00,889 --> 02:41:04,340
state's list of allowable pesticides is

4203
02:41:02,569 --> 02:41:05,689
sporadic at best with most city and

4204
02:41:04,340 --> 02:41:07,750
state officials responding to complaints

4205
02:41:05,689 --> 02:41:10,159
rather than inspecting each facility

4206
02:41:07,750 --> 02:41:11,959
Colorado had about five years of medical

4207
02:41:10,159 --> 02:41:14,809
marijuana cultivation and sales before

4208
02:41:11,959 --> 02:41:17,059
the state in 2013 began compiling a list

4209
02:41:14,809 --> 02:41:19,340
of which pesticides could be used on the

4210
02:41:17,059 --> 02:41:21,889
plants officials admit that reflects an

4211
02:41:19,340 --> 02:41:24,228
imperfect system Colorado's marijuana

4212
02:41:21,889 --> 02:41:26,260
Tsar Andrew Friedman said the state is

4213
02:41:24,228 --> 02:41:28,819
dealing with the problem as best it can

4214
02:41:26,260 --> 02:41:31,219
many growers are new to regulated

4215
02:41:28,819 --> 02:41:33,049
pesticide use beyond that like banking

4216
02:41:31,219 --> 02:41:35,299
the pesticide regulatory system is

4217
02:41:33,049 --> 02:41:37,340
heavily built on federal involvement Sen

4218
02:41:35,299 --> 02:41:38,840
Friedman director of Governor John

4219
02:41:37,340 --> 02:41:41,180
Hickenlooper office of Marijuana

4220
02:41:38,840 --> 02:41:42,799
coordination I know that's not a

4221
02:41:41,180 --> 02:41:44,569
completely satisfying answer and

4222
02:41:42,799 --> 02:41:46,069
honestly I wish we had these challenges

4223
02:41:44,569 --> 02:41:48,770
solved by day one but we're working

4224
02:41:46,069 --> 02:41:50,689
toward an enforceable solution that also

4225
02:41:48,770 --> 02:41:53,810
protects consumers from other

4226
02:41:50,689 --> 02:41:55,430
contaminants such as mold so you guys

4227
02:41:53,809 --> 02:41:57,199
they are trying to keep the cannabis

4228
02:41:55,430 --> 02:41:59,389
safe they're testing it now to find out

4229
02:41:57,200 --> 02:42:00,860
what is in it they are figuring out what

4230
02:41:59,389 --> 02:42:02,569
pesticides we should and should not be

4231
02:42:00,860 --> 02:42:02,989
using they are setting levels they are

4232
02:42:02,569 --> 02:42:05,208
try

4233
02:42:02,988 --> 02:42:06,798
to keep the consumer safe we have taken

4234
02:42:05,209 --> 02:42:08,600
this out of the basement we have put it

4235
02:42:06,799 --> 02:42:10,970
into the store and now we're putting it

4236
02:42:08,600 --> 02:42:13,399
into laboratories I hope this shows the

4237
02:42:10,969 --> 02:42:16,188
Colorado is doing our best to make a

4238
02:42:13,398 --> 02:42:18,469
legitimate business out of cannabis this

4239
02:42:16,189 --> 02:42:20,359
isn't just weed anymore this is a

4240
02:42:18,469 --> 02:42:22,788
product this is a commercial product

4241
02:42:20,359 --> 02:42:24,318
that's being tested I am impressed but

4242
02:42:22,789 --> 02:42:26,060
at the same time I'm bummed out that

4243
02:42:24,318 --> 02:42:28,519
there are well-known companies like

4244
02:42:26,059 --> 02:42:30,439
Mahatma that are still screwing it up

4245
02:42:28,520 --> 02:42:32,539
and mislabelling and making mistakes

4246
02:42:30,439 --> 02:42:34,189
like this Mihama has one cannabis cups I

4247
02:42:32,539 --> 02:42:35,930
have done business with Mahatma and

4248
02:42:34,189 --> 02:42:37,338
they've always been super kind to me so

4249
02:42:35,930 --> 02:42:38,779
it's a little disappointing to see an

4250
02:42:37,338 --> 02:42:41,088
industry leader come out and make a

4251
02:42:38,779 --> 02:42:42,199
mistake like this they will get it

4252
02:42:41,088 --> 02:42:43,578
together they'll get their [ __ ] together

4253
02:42:42,199 --> 02:42:45,199
and like they said they were only going

4254
02:42:43,578 --> 02:42:47,838
by the labels that they were given by

4255
02:42:45,199 --> 02:42:49,248
the growers so that was probably not

4256
02:42:47,838 --> 02:42:50,719
their fault I want to go ahead and give

4257
02:42:49,248 --> 02:42:52,998
them the benefit of the doubt Mahatma

4258
02:42:50,719 --> 02:42:56,509
didn't do this on purpose they were just

4259
02:42:52,998 --> 02:42:59,059
going off of labels so this next article

4260
02:42:56,509 --> 02:43:02,270
is completely related to this a lot of

4261
02:42:59,059 --> 02:43:04,068
this testing and pesticide testing and

4262
02:43:02,270 --> 02:43:07,220
safety inspections have all stemmed from

4263
02:43:04,068 --> 02:43:09,350
a few small incidents but it has sparked

4264
02:43:07,219 --> 02:43:12,078
a lot of investigation and it is going

4265
02:43:09,350 --> 02:43:14,149
to improve our industry in my opinion so

4266
02:43:12,078 --> 02:43:16,369
I'm going to read another article that

4267
02:43:14,148 --> 02:43:18,198
came out the day after the last article

4268
02:43:16,369 --> 02:43:20,088
this one says Colorado State AG

4269
02:43:18,199 --> 02:43:21,949
officials watch probes on pesticides

4270
02:43:20,088 --> 02:43:23,898
Colorado Department of Agriculture has

4271
02:43:21,949 --> 02:43:25,850
investigations underway on pesticide

4272
02:43:23,898 --> 02:43:27,648
misuse by Denver marijuana businesses

4273
02:43:25,850 --> 02:43:29,390
mahatma concentrates and treatments

4274
02:43:27,648 --> 02:43:31,068
unlimited so this is pretty much a

4275
02:43:29,389 --> 02:43:33,528
follow up of the last article I read

4276
02:43:31,068 --> 02:43:36,618
this is again by David McCoy and Ricardo

4277
02:43:33,529 --> 02:43:39,140
Baca and the article goes like this

4278
02:43:36,619 --> 02:43:40,939
Colorado agriculture officials have have

4279
02:43:39,139 --> 02:43:42,769
opened an investigation into a marijuana

4280
02:43:40,939 --> 02:43:44,689
grow operation named in a report by the

4281
02:43:42,770 --> 02:43:46,729
Denver Post about pesticide residues

4282
02:43:44,689 --> 02:43:48,259
residues and they confirmed a second

4283
02:43:46,728 --> 02:43:50,688
business named and the story was already

4284
02:43:48,259 --> 02:43:52,459
under scrutiny it is unclear which of

4285
02:43:50,689 --> 02:43:54,408
the two companies Mahatma concentrates

4286
02:43:52,459 --> 02:43:56,539
or treatments unlimited both in Denver

4287
02:43:54,408 --> 02:43:57,708
was already under scrutiny and officials

4288
02:43:56,539 --> 02:44:00,289
with the Colorado Department of

4289
02:43:57,709 --> 02:44:02,149
Agriculture would not elaborate but the

4290
02:44:00,289 --> 02:44:03,890
agency said investigations and two other

4291
02:44:02,148 --> 02:44:07,430
businesses used of pesticides is the

4292
02:44:03,889 --> 02:44:09,168
focus of its probe the CDA has one

4293
02:44:07,430 --> 02:44:10,759
ongoing investigation with one of the

4294
02:44:09,168 --> 02:44:13,009
growers and based on the information

4295
02:44:10,759 --> 02:44:15,078
supplied in the article we have opened a

4296
02:44:13,009 --> 02:44:15,780
second investigation into the other name

4297
02:44:15,078 --> 02:44:17,520
grower too

4298
02:44:15,780 --> 02:44:19,409
determine if they're pesticide use isn't

4299
02:44:17,521 --> 02:44:21,450
compliance with the Colorado pesticide

applicators Act CDA spokeswoman

4301
02:44:21,450 --> 02:44:25,409
Christie Lightcap said in an email

4302
02:44:23,271 --> 02:44:26,851
penalties on the growers could range

4303
02:44:25,409 --> 02:44:29,640
from a simple order to stop the

4304
02:44:26,851 --> 02:44:32,069
prohibited conduct to fines up to $1,000

4305
02:44:29,640 --> 02:44:33,959
for each violation under the Act repeat

4306
02:44:32,069 --> 02:44:35,489
offenders fines are doubled and chronic

4307
02:44:33,959 --> 02:44:37,680
offenders face potential license

4308
02:44:35,489 --> 02:44:39,629
sanctions like cap said although laws

4309
02:44:37,681 --> 02:44:41,579
require marijuana businesses to test for

4310
02:44:39,629 --> 02:44:44,129
pesticide residues that rule has not

4311
02:44:41,579 --> 02:44:45,899
only has not been enforced because only

4312
02:44:44,129 --> 02:44:48,329
one facility is certified to do that

4313
02:44:45,899 --> 02:44:50,039
analysis Colorado marijuana enforcement

4314
02:44:48,329 --> 02:44:51,780
division rules show marijuana that tests

4315
02:44:50,040 --> 02:44:53,931
positive for unapproved pesticides and

4316
02:44:51,780 --> 02:44:56,011
other contaminants must be destroyed or

4317
02:44:53,931 --> 02:44:58,380
decontaminated because I don't know how

4318
02:44:56,011 --> 02:45:00,450
to decontaminate cannabis you can't

4319
02:44:58,379 --> 02:45:02,399
really wash it off so I think your

4320
02:45:00,450 --> 02:45:04,230
option is to destroy it the Post on

02:45:26,970 --> 02:45:30,539
Denver was one of eleven marijuana

4335
02:45:28,771 --> 02:45:32,311
growers to have about one thousand per

4336
02:45:30,540 --> 02:45:33,690
hundred thousand plants quarantined

4337
02:45:32,310 --> 02:45:36,420
earlier this year by Denver health

4338
02:45:33,690 --> 02:45:37,800
officials over pesticide concerns the

4339
02:45:36,420 --> 02:45:40,261
city allowed most of the plants back

4340
02:45:37,799 --> 02:45:41,879
into commerce including those grown by

4341
02:45:40,261 --> 02:45:43,351
treatments when levels of pesticide

4342
02:45:41,879 --> 02:45:45,449
residues dropped to the lowest amount

4343
02:45:43,351 --> 02:45:46,980
allowed on food crops to other

4344
02:45:45,450 --> 02:45:49,590
businesses destroyed the plants rather

4345
02:45:46,979 --> 02:45:51,119
than wait for pesticide test results see

4346
02:45:49,590 --> 02:45:52,620
DA's announcement on Wednesday came a

4347
02:45:51,120 --> 02:45:54,000
day after the Denver Department of

4348
02:45:52,620 --> 02:45:55,829
Environmental Health issued a broad

4349
02:45:54,000 --> 02:45:57,560
recall of them of Mahatma products

4350
02:45:55,829 --> 02:45:59,521
following a visit to that shop

4351
02:45:57,560 --> 02:46:00,810
inspectors were expected to be a

4352
02:45:59,521 --> 02:46:03,150
treatments growing warehouse on

4353
02:46:00,810 --> 02:46:04,949
Wednesday retailers with recalled

4354
02:46:03,149 --> 02:46:06,779
products were instructed to remove them

4355
02:46:04,950 --> 02:46:08,460
from store shelves and either destroy

4356
02:46:06,780 --> 02:46:10,261
the products in compliance with any D

4357
02:46:08,459 --> 02:46:12,029
regulations or return the products to

4358
02:46:10,261 --> 02:46:14,130
the manufacturer said Dan Rowland

4359
02:46:12,030 --> 02:46:16,471
spokesman for the Denver's Office of

4360
02:46:14,129 --> 02:46:18,420
Marijuana Policy consumers should either

4361
02:46:16,470 --> 02:46:20,189
destroy any recalled product they have

4362
02:46:18,420 --> 02:46:22,021
or return it to the store of purchase

4363
02:46:20,190 --> 02:46:23,971
Roland said this information of

4364
02:46:22,021 --> 02:46:25,620
potential pesticide misuse is concerning

4365
02:46:23,970 --> 02:46:28,949
Lightcap said in an announcing

4366
02:46:25,620 --> 02:46:29,730
investigation the CDA has identified a

4367
02:46:28,950 --> 02:46:31,381
list of product

4368
02:46:29,729 --> 02:46:33,239
that can be used on marijuana and had as

4369
02:46:31,380 --> 02:46:35,729
it has been available to growers for

4370
02:46:33,239 --> 02:46:37,229
well over one year pesticides on

4371
02:46:35,729 --> 02:46:40,409
marijuana is a controversial topic

4372
02:46:37,229 --> 02:46:41,970
because no science no science exists to

4373
02:46:40,409 --> 02:46:44,579
say which products are safe for

4374
02:46:41,970 --> 02:46:46,500
consumers although several pesticides

4375
02:46:44,579 --> 02:46:48,210
are approved for use on some fruit and

4376
02:46:46,500 --> 02:46:50,159
vegetable crops the US Environmental

4377
02:46:48,210 --> 02:46:51,750
Protection Agency cannot say whether

4378
02:46:50,159 --> 02:46:55,079
they are safe on marijuana because the

4379
02:46:51,750 --> 02:46:56,819
plant is illegal under federal law CDA

4380
02:46:55,079 --> 02:46:58,800
has complied compiled a list of

4381
02:46:56,819 --> 02:47:00,539
pesticides some of them so non-toxic

4382
02:46:58,800 --> 02:47:02,369
that they do not require federal

4383
02:47:00,540 --> 02:47:03,721
registration that can be used on

4384
02:47:02,370 --> 02:47:06,181
marijuana based on their label

4385
02:47:03,720 --> 02:47:07,859
restrictions not on their safety it is a

4386
02:47:06,181 --> 02:47:09,690
violation of federal law to use any

4387
02:47:07,860 --> 02:47:12,391
pesticide contrary to its label

4388
02:47:09,690 --> 02:47:13,950
directions CDA has chosen those products

4389
02:47:12,390 --> 02:47:15,779
whose label restrictions were so broad

4390
02:47:13,950 --> 02:47:18,601
that using them on marijuana would not

4391
02:47:15,780 --> 02:47:20,311
be in violation but CDA officials have

4392
02:47:18,601 --> 02:47:22,500
constantly said they do not recommend

4393
02:47:20,310 --> 02:47:24,119
using pesticides on marijuana nor will

4394
02:47:22,500 --> 02:47:26,040
they say those products that appear on

4395
02:47:24,120 --> 02:47:28,471
its list of approved pesticides are

4396
02:47:26,040 --> 02:47:30,301
safety consumers we are in a completely

4397
02:47:28,470 --> 02:47:32,520
new business here and we're building a

4398
02:47:30,300 --> 02:47:33,779
space shuttle that is not done but has

4399
02:47:32,521 --> 02:47:36,000
not been done anywhere else

4400
02:47:33,780 --> 02:47:38,101
Colorado agricultural Commissioner Don

4401
02:47:36,000 --> 02:47:39,720
Brown said other states including New

4402
02:47:38,101 --> 02:47:41,881
Hampshire have restricted pesticides

4403
02:47:39,720 --> 02:47:43,890
allowed on marijuana only to those so

4404
02:47:41,880 --> 02:47:46,350
non-toxic that federal registration is

4405
02:47:43,890 --> 02:47:47,880
not required Colorado nearly did the

4406
02:47:46,351 --> 02:47:50,310
same but the industry argued that

4407
02:47:47,880 --> 02:47:52,439
non-toxic pesticides mainly organics

4408
02:47:50,310 --> 02:47:54,511
such as neem cinnamon and peppermint

4409
02:47:52,440 --> 02:47:56,671
oils or nearly strong enough to combat

4410
02:47:54,511 --> 02:48:00,329
effectively the pests and mildews that

4411
02:47:56,671 --> 02:48:02,521
most commonly attack their truck you

4412
02:48:00,329 --> 02:48:05,101
know I'm I'm kind of torn by pesticides

4413
02:48:02,521 --> 02:48:08,131
because I run a commercial grow and we

4414
02:48:05,101 --> 02:48:11,579
cannot lose a million-dollar harvest to

4415
02:48:08,130 --> 02:48:13,710
bugs so we have to do something to keep

4416
02:48:11,579 --> 02:48:16,079
bugs off of it I agree with this last

4417
02:48:13,710 --> 02:48:17,909
statement here that organics such as

4418
02:48:16,079 --> 02:48:20,370
neem oil cinnamon and peppermint oils

4419
02:48:17,909 --> 02:48:22,591
and rosemary oil is something and cedar

4420
02:48:20,370 --> 02:48:25,290
oil is also something commonly is those

4421
02:48:22,591 --> 02:48:27,829
oils are great as a preventative those

4422
02:48:25,290 --> 02:48:30,240
are wonderful on a small scale grow

4423
02:48:27,829 --> 02:48:33,120
unfortunately those types of oils will

4424
02:48:30,239 --> 02:48:34,319
end up in your concentrate just like all

4425
02:48:33,120 --> 02:48:38,490
of these pesticides

4426
02:48:34,319 --> 02:48:40,050
I can taste neem oil in your dabs if you

4427
02:48:38,489 --> 02:48:41,729
spray neem oil on your plants early

4428
02:48:40,050 --> 02:48:43,260
before a flower or just before a flower

4429
02:48:41,729 --> 02:48:44,728
or early into flower

4430
02:48:43,260 --> 02:48:47,850
I can taste the neem oil in your

4431
02:48:44,728 --> 02:48:49,228
extracts recently I had some dabs given

4432
02:48:47,850 --> 02:48:50,729
to me by an artist he wanted me to

4433
02:48:49,228 --> 02:48:54,000
sample them and I could taste the

4434
02:48:50,728 --> 02:48:55,829
rosemary oil in his concentrate so using

4435
02:48:54,000 --> 02:48:58,020
essential oils isn't always the cure

4436
02:48:55,829 --> 02:49:00,779
that end all the preventive the answer

4437
02:48:58,020 --> 02:49:02,430
also sometimes you have to use some type

4438
02:49:00,779 --> 02:49:05,100
of a pesticide especially when you're

4439
02:49:02,430 --> 02:49:06,689
getting clones from other people that's

4440
02:49:05,100 --> 02:49:09,029
where I find I get the bugs the most

4441
02:49:06,689 --> 02:49:11,309
often is when I get a clone as a gift

4442
02:49:09,029 --> 02:49:13,140
from another grower it almost always has

4443
02:49:11,309 --> 02:49:15,299
some kind of a bug on it so when you get

4444
02:49:13,139 --> 02:49:17,430
a new clone that's when I treat with I

4445
02:49:15,299 --> 02:49:19,228
use heavy [ __ ] depending on what the

4446
02:49:17,430 --> 02:49:21,090
clone is and what bugs I see on it but I

4447
02:49:19,228 --> 02:49:23,549
will use some pretty radical treatment

4448
02:49:21,090 --> 02:49:25,469
because I cannot risk my mother plants

4449
02:49:23,549 --> 02:49:27,719
giving spider mites I cannot risk my

4450
02:49:25,469 --> 02:49:30,329
mother plants getting broad mites I'm a

4451
02:49:27,719 --> 02:49:32,608
breeder I rely on my mother plants that

4452
02:49:30,329 --> 02:49:34,379
is my future that is my work I've spent

4453
02:49:32,609 --> 02:49:36,779
years developing those mother plants if

4454
02:49:34,379 --> 02:49:38,909
bugs destroyed those oh I would be

4455
02:49:36,779 --> 02:49:42,060
devastated so I do understand the need

4456
02:49:38,909 --> 02:49:44,489
for a little bit of a stronger pesticide

4457
02:49:42,059 --> 02:49:46,859
in a commercial environment something

4458
02:49:44,489 --> 02:49:50,689
that I have recently started doing I am

4459
02:49:46,859 --> 02:49:54,930
studying for a Department of Agriculture

4460
02:49:50,689 --> 02:49:57,359
pesticide applicators test I think

4461
02:49:54,930 --> 02:49:59,818
anybody that is spraying pesticides in

4462
02:49:57,359 --> 02:50:01,529
any type of a garden should have to at

4463
02:49:59,818 --> 02:50:02,760
least examine this test you don't have

4464
02:50:01,529 --> 02:50:04,319
to pass it I work in a commercial

4465
02:50:02,760 --> 02:50:06,120
facility I will be training new

4466
02:50:04,318 --> 02:50:07,949
employees on pesticide safety I'm

4467
02:50:06,120 --> 02:50:09,510
required to take this test I would

4468
02:50:07,950 --> 02:50:12,300
encourage anybody who's going to play

4469
02:50:09,510 --> 02:50:14,850
with pesticides to take this test it

4470
02:50:12,299 --> 02:50:16,469
will teach you a lot about pesticide

4471
02:50:14,850 --> 02:50:18,120
safety to start with how to handle a

4472
02:50:16,469 --> 02:50:20,010
pesticide how to apply a pesticide

4473
02:50:18,120 --> 02:50:22,079
safely what to wear when you're doing it

4474
02:50:20,010 --> 02:50:25,250
but it will also teach you what is in

4475
02:50:22,079 --> 02:50:27,450
almost everything there are very few

4476
02:50:25,250 --> 02:50:29,189
chemicals that they're using and all

4477
02:50:27,450 --> 02:50:30,630
these brands they're just different

4478
02:50:29,189 --> 02:50:32,489
brands with different labels it's the

4479
02:50:30,629 --> 02:50:34,289
same chemical in almost everything and

4480
02:50:32,489 --> 02:50:36,449
if you learn what chemicals kill which

4481
02:50:34,290 --> 02:50:38,370
bugs it makes your job a lot easier

4482
02:50:36,450 --> 02:50:40,170
so I recommend studying up on this

4483
02:50:38,370 --> 02:50:41,520
pesticide test go to your state's a

4484
02:50:40,170 --> 02:50:43,950
great Department of Agriculture website

4485
02:50:41,520 --> 02:50:45,630
and see if there's an applicator test

4486
02:50:43,950 --> 02:50:47,370
anybody who does a job like an

4487
02:50:45,629 --> 02:50:49,079
exterminator or something like that has

4488
02:50:47,370 --> 02:50:51,450
to pass this test so it's available in

4489
02:50:49,079 --> 02:50:53,340
your area it'll help you combat your

4490
02:50:51,450 --> 02:50:55,710
pest problems a lot better and it will

4491
02:50:53,340 --> 02:50:56,488
also keep you safe just something I

4492
02:50:55,709 --> 02:50:57,929
recommend

4493
02:50:56,488 --> 02:50:59,639
something I'm doing so do it with me

4494
02:50:57,930 --> 02:51:02,189
it'll be fun we can do it together all

4495
02:50:59,639 --> 02:51:04,829
right so my point with these articles is

4496
02:51:02,189 --> 02:51:06,389
that we are not screwing around here in

4497
02:51:04,829 --> 02:51:08,340
Colorado we are actually testing

4498
02:51:06,389 --> 02:51:10,439
products to make sure that things are

4499
02:51:08,340 --> 02:51:11,969
safe we have stepped up our game we're

4500
02:51:10,439 --> 02:51:13,800
gonna separate well I'm going to see a

4501
02:51:11,969 --> 02:51:15,568
lot of businesses fall apart because of

4502
02:51:13,799 --> 02:51:18,119
all this new regulation with pesticide

4503
02:51:15,568 --> 02:51:20,219
testing a lot of the growers that think

4504
02:51:18,120 --> 02:51:22,529
they are master growers and pro growers

4505
02:51:20,219 --> 02:51:23,818
are not going to know what to do once

4506
02:51:22,529 --> 02:51:25,680
they start getting rid of some of the

4507
02:51:23,818 --> 02:51:27,359
pesticides we're gonna have to start

4508
02:51:25,680 --> 02:51:30,720
using an integrated pest management

4509
02:51:27,359 --> 02:51:32,670
system was live insects it's gonna be a

4510
02:51:30,719 --> 02:51:33,840
whole different ballgame pretty soon I'm

4511
02:51:32,670 --> 02:51:35,988
gonna write that down because that

4512
02:51:33,840 --> 02:51:38,809
sounds like a good episode

4513
02:51:35,988 --> 02:51:40,799
good idea we could talk about integrated

4514
02:51:38,809 --> 02:51:44,510
burping we could talk about integrated

4515
02:51:40,799 --> 02:51:44,509
pest management on a whole other episode

4516
02:51:46,818 --> 02:51:50,398
we'll try to get Shawn over to talk

4517
02:51:48,840 --> 02:51:52,620
about organic integrated pest management

4518
