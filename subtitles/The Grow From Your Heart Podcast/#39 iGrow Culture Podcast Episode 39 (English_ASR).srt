167
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:44,479
a cheese buddy for New Years and I think

168
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:46,318
I'm going to be the cheese buddy quite a

169
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:47,639

171
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:51,079
everybody also check out Nature's green

172
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:53,198

181
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:12,039
election last night Colorado did not

182
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:15,720
have much cannabis initiative on the

183
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:18,240
ballots but we did have number 105

184
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:22,080
regarding non-GMO food this was the

185
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:24,439
labeling of GMO Foods Colorado dude you

186
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:27,359
failed bro what the hell this was

187
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:28,719
supposed to pass this was uh what this

188
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,120
was we're not going to get too much into

189
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,919
it because it's already happened

190
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,720
this was we wanted them to have to mark

191
00:06:32,918 --> 00:06:36,279
genetically modified food products with

192
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,520
some sort of indication that it is

193
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:40,918
genetically

194
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:44,359
modified enriched with GMOs we did not

195
00:06:40,918 --> 00:06:47,198
pass this what the hell is going on

196
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:48,319
Colorado all right yeah and it failed by

197
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,160
Landslide that's the really

198
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,000
disappointing part I liked your uh Jesse

199
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,560
BR a really good Facebook post he said

200
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,959
something to the effect of that's okay

201
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:57,560
Colorado I didn't want to share my

202
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:59,918
organic produce with you anyway uh

203
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:01,399
Jesse's tomatoes are delicious I am

204

207
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,720
that place is dud they get so many shout

208
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:11,160
outs on this podcast I'm addicted to

209
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:14,039
that place I eat there a lot uh we went

210
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:17,639
up there with uh burn and uh Burn's

211
00:07:14,038 --> 00:07:19,560
cousin and uh they made customers yeah

212
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:21,000
yeah they made friends they treat you

213
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,360
like your family when you're there They

214
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,879
Know My Name by now they start writing

215
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,080
down my order when they see me in line

216
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:29,039
they like you want the same thing dude

217
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:32,198
and I'm like yep yeah it's a it's a um

218
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:35,240
I've never seen that many uh M uh

219
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:37,478
different drinks yeah so like I was a

220
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,680
little overwhelmed at first it is it's a

221
00:07:37,478 --> 00:07:40,318
little strange the first time you walk

222
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,720
it well the the vibe there is very

223
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,080
unique so when you walk in you're almost

224
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:46,560
in a new world turn your cell phone up

225
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:48,878
when you go in there please I agree but

226
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,720
there are so many people in there I go

227
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,599
I've gone late at night and midday and

228
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,319
if you go during the day it's like uh

229
00:07:52,598 --> 00:07:56,639
it's 20 something with their MacBooks

230
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,759
and their iPhones all over the place but

231
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,680
you're right around around 11 or 12 I

232
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:02,038
wish we could get put their phones away

233
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,400
and chill out cuz it's really chill in

234
00:08:02,038 --> 00:08:06,158
there there were some people playing

235
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:07,359
chess and uh a couple people looked like

236
00:08:06,158 --> 00:08:08,839
they were on a date or something it's

237
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,000
just real chill in metal the guys

238
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:13,279
playing chess in there look like robots

239
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:17,079
they're so good at chess dude the one

240
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:18,478
guy I I swear he was playing chess with

241
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:21,158
the guy in front of him and then he was

242
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:23,639
also playing it on his

243
00:08:21,158 --> 00:08:27,000
iPad he's predicting what could happen

244
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:28,400
or something yeah I was like man so I've

245
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,279
got a funny joke that only a few

246
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:31,359
listeners are going to get we were at

247
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:33,319
it's we're talking about a place called

248
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:36,038
the mate factor and they make yurba mate

249
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:37,479
it's a Brazilian energizing tea um they

250
00:08:36,038 --> 00:08:40,080
have two different kinds they have the

251
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:42,278
dark yurba mate which is what I prefer

252
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:45,759
and then they have got the green yurba

253
00:08:42,278 --> 00:08:47,200
mate which I prefer the green iced and I

254
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:48,519
like the dark hot that's just my

255
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,480
preference so if I need a cool drink

256
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:53,240
I'll get the green one the guy was

257
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,759
describing the differences to a customer

258
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,320
who it's in a really touristy area so

259
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:57,600
you get a lot of touristy kind of people

260
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,079
they're describing this drink to a

261
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,839
tourist and he said that the dark roast

262
00:09:00,078 --> 00:09:03,479
is the dried leaves that have been set

263
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,760
out and they've dried and they crumble

264
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,440
it and then they brew it or they grind

265
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:08,559
it and then they brew it together and he

266
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:10,480
said the green is more the fresh leaf

267
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:12,518
that hasn't been dried and set out for

268
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,759
as long and I heard him say that and I

269
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:17,159
looked at the girl that was with me and

270
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:17,159
I said he's talking about that live

271
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:22,919
res nice only a few listeners are going

272
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:24,720
to laugh at that but that's exactly the

273
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:27,399
description that worked perfectly it's

274
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,360
all about that live resin the dark roast

275
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:30,919
is the dried and cured and then the

276
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,519
fresh green is the live res and you can

277
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:35,078
taste the difference it's such a huge

278
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:37,240
bold the difference um I had only ever

279
00:09:35,078 --> 00:09:39,078
had the green uh before I went up there

280
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:41,159

have legalized recreational Cannabis

306
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:37,440
welcome to the cool kid Club yeah

307
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,759
Florida on the other

308
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:43,200
hand you're just old people in Disney

309
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:45,600
World still how many people in

310
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,879
Florida do you think could actually

311
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,240
reduce their like their their pain

312
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:51,838
medication

313
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:53,600
consumption uh drastically every day do

314
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,800
you think that maybe some of those pain

315
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,399
companies the pain clinics kind of

316
00:10:55,799 --> 00:11:00,000
lobbied against all of this medical

317
00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:02,679
cannabis or cannabis no surely not I

318
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,039
mean I I would think a a big major

319
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:05,919
corporation would have a lot more

320
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:07,399
Integrity than that good honest company

321
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:08,599
that we need to do something like that

322
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:09,759
because that would be kind of cheating

323
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:13,079
and

324
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:16,600
dishonest just poisoning their citizens

325
00:11:13,078 --> 00:11:18,439
no come on big Pharma yeah yeah so if

326
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,720
you uh if you did not go out and vote

327
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,800
you can't [ __ ] about what happened in

328
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,160
Florida but if you voted in Florida and

329
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:24,919
I'm sorry you did not get your cannabis

say I kind of cut off oh I was going to

334
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:34,040
say unless for some reason they're

335
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:37,720
listening to this and they voted against

336
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:40,039

337
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:41,839

not pay the

339
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:46,360
fine nobody's tallied up how many times

340
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:48,519
I uh said the f word on so many episodes

341
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:50,000
so whoever was paying attention uh you

342
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:51,519
got to go math that up for me and we're

343
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,039
going to discontinue that actually we're

344
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,360
going to stop doing it because I haven't

345
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:55,639
said that in quite a long time on the

346
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,399
show so it's kind of cool somebody let

347
00:11:55,639 --> 00:12:01,039
me know what I owe and I'll pay it I H

348
00:11:57,399 --> 00:12:03,360
you on two for one episode yeah yeah but

349
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:05,159
I don't remember which one or when or

350
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,440
where or anything so Dreadful Jay where

351
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:07,879
are you girl you always listen to the

352
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:11,040
show and remind me of funny stuff that I

353
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:12,879
said so count up those FWS uh what else

354
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:16,480
was I going to say Washington DC our

355
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:18,679
nation's capital now has legalized

356
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,800
cannabis why doesn't the rest of the

357
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:24,039
nation just follow suit with what the

358
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:27,759
capital has done yeah I guess it there

359
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:30,198
are intelligent people in DC contrary to

360
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:32,519
popular belief hopefully change some of

361
00:12:30,198 --> 00:12:33,958
the uh their Habits Like while they're

362
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:36,560
up there doing what they do instead of

363
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:39,319
just droning on and be like yo bro I

364
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:42,198
think that these GMOs were Croc of [ __ ]

365
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:44,320
and we need to knock this [ __ ] out bro

366
00:12:42,198 --> 00:12:48,519
can I get a ey and then everyone will be

367
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:50,360
like yeah o this just made uh getting a

368
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:53,759
uh uh smoking a joint in front of the

369
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:56,240
White House photo op a lot easier

370
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:57,720
o well that's uh there was actually I

371
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,839
was at Garden of the Gods and I think I

372
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:01,199
saw a sign that reminded you reminded

373
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:04,199
you that that's a state park and you

374
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:06,039
cannot bring your cannabis there oh yeah

375
00:13:04,198 --> 00:13:07,359
because it's still federal land so I'm

376
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:08,759
pretty sure that that White House land

377
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,159
is federal land and you can't have your

378
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:12,519
cannabis

379
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:13,958
there good point yeah if you uh if you

380
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:15,278
go to a state park right now in Colorado

381
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:17,198
people that are not from Colorado this

382
00:13:15,278 --> 00:13:19,879
is a random we did not prepare this part

383
00:13:17,198 --> 00:13:22,838
at all if you're not uh if you were in a

384
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:27,078
state park in Colorado like Red Rocks is

385
00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:29,160
a state park uh most uh the reservoirs

386
00:13:27,078 --> 00:13:30,399
like the PUO Reservoir all the big

387
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:31,879
reservoirs where you'd want to go hang

388
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:35,039
out most of the cool [ __ ] is a state

389
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:36,320
park you cannot take you you can I mean

390
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:39,319
you can they're not stopping everybody

391
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,920
in check you it for years yeah we do but

392
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:42,440
we're not going to say we do but you can

393
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:43,958
take we're not encouraging it's illegal

394
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:46,560
to actually have cannabis at a state

395
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:48,159
park so yeah even if it's legal in DC

396
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:49,559
smoking a joint at the White House is

397
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:51,198
still going to be a little sketchy

398
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:53,638
although shout out to Snoop Dog Snoop

399
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:54,958
claims that he smoked that weed at the

400
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:56,519
the White House there and also big shout

401
00:13:54,958 --> 00:14:00,278
out to Willie we know Willie smoked at

402
00:13:56,519 --> 00:14:02,240
the at the White House so all right so

403
00:14:00,278 --> 00:14:04,958
Bill Clinton smoked something there

404
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:07,440
Monica Lewinsky smoked something

405
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:08,838
there they just turned 50 recently and

406
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,360
there were pictures of her online I'm

407
00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:13,199
not going to comment on the pictures but

408
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:15,120
that did happen oh man doesn't that kind

409
00:14:13,198 --> 00:14:17,278
of make you feel old I wasn't going to

410
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,399
go there I that did come to AC cross my

411
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:21,439
mind but all right we've been talking

412
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:23,600
about uh Jesse and I were talking about

413
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,480
building a room a couple episodes back

414
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,920
and we're talking about planning your

415
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,120
grow room we talked about selecting your

416
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:29,919
space uh being a responsible grower um

417
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,440
this episode we're going to talk more

418
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:32,919
about building and setting up your grow

419
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,240
we're going to discuss grow tents a

420
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:36,319
little bit or those Hydro Huts or

421
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,879
whatever you want to call them and maybe

422
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,480
if we have enough time we're already 15

423
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:42,600
minutes in if we have enough time I will

424
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:44,920
try to uh tackle that $500 grow room

425
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:47,600
question that's going to be a challenge

426
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:49,879
but um basically do everything that

427
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,240
we're doing and go much smaller dude we

428
00:14:49,879 --> 00:14:52,439
don't even get to pots and soil and

429
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,240
stuff on the stuff that I've got written

430
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:56,320
and we've got five pages of stuff typed

431
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:59,000
out so this is going to be a

432
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:01,320
lot um we wrapped up the last gr up

433
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,799
episode with to talk about deciding how

434
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:04,480
much light to use in your space and we

435
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:05,679
kind of talked about uh where you're

436
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,120
going to hang the lights and where

437
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:10,439
you're going to my phone is making noise

438
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:11,320
that's a poor podcast move right there

439
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,759
oh it's

440
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:17,399
already no yeah it was on silent I don't

441
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:18,199
know what that was all right um yeah

442
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:19,039
talking about we're going to hang the

443
00:15:18,198 --> 00:15:20,078
lights how you're going to vent the

444
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:22,319
humidity we talked a little bit about

445
00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:23,719
bringing fresh air into the room uh so

446
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,759
now let's kind of talk about building a

447
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:28,278
room which is kind of helpful cuz Jesse

448
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:29,600
has a lot of experience in this uh you

449
00:15:28,278 --> 00:15:31,919
need to make a clean grow space that

450
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,199
allows you to control the light cycles

451
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:34,318
the temperature during the day the

452
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:36,318
temperature during the night and you

453
00:15:34,318 --> 00:15:38,519
need to control the humidity and it's

454
00:15:36,318 --> 00:15:40,120
also ideal to have a lot of control over

455
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:41,679
the air going in and out of the grow

456
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:43,679
space uh if you're using an extra

457
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:45,120
bedroom or a closet you'll have all the

458
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:47,318
walls already built but you'll need to

459
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,560
work around the existing room Jesse was

460
00:15:47,318 --> 00:15:50,399
talking about working in a brick

461
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:52,000
building or a brick facility I don't

462
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:53,839
know where it is I didn't ask I don't

463
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,639
want to know but he was talking about

464
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:56,720
it's 150 years old and it's brick and

465
00:15:55,639 --> 00:15:58,959
that's got to suck because you don't

466
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,480
have anything to screw [ __ ] into uh

467
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:02,799
bricks crumble if you hit them with a

468
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,720
hammer and try to put nails into them sh

469
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:07,240
can go really wrong if you move one

470
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,839
brick now you've got an unstable wall

471
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:10,560
all right so I'm ranting about a brick

472
00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:12,440
Oh yeah if you've got an open area like

473
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:13,958
a garage or a basement or maybe Jesse's

474
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,680
brick area you're going to need to build

475
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:17,119
a room you can't you could just hang

476
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:18,519
lights up in your garage or in that

477
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,278
basement but it's going to be a lot

478
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:22,560
easier if you build a room or set up a

479
00:16:20,278 --> 00:16:24,600
free pre-fabricated grow Hut uh because

480
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:27,000
that just gives you actually control

481
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:29,319
over your environment and an environment

482
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,440
simple reflection and trapping the light

483
00:16:29,318 --> 00:16:34,039
and having it reflect around makes the

484
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,720
light up to 30% more efficient is what I

485
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:37,639
read in a couple of books one said 20

486
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:39,839
one said 30 how about we'll settle on

487
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:43,480
25% more efficient and if you're running

488
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:45,360
a th000 watt light that's 250 Watts

489
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:47,399
basically of efficiency that you're

490
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,919
going to not lose by having more

491
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:51,318
reflection so just putting it in a good

492
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:53,000
designed room is already saving you

493
00:16:51,318 --> 00:16:54,838
money and increasing buds because like

494
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,240
we talked about on another show the

495
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:59,319
light is the main nutrient for your

496
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,600
plants it's not what you pour in it's

497
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:02,120
not what you feed it it's actually the

498
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,279
light

499
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:06,880
so uh where are we Let's uh let's

500
00:17:04,279 --> 00:17:08,000
actually get into building a room I was

501
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,199
looking at all kinds of stuff and trying

502
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,880
to figure out how to do this I just

503
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:14,120
decided let's kind of build a four light

504
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:16,199
room um we're going to act like we're

505
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:17,918
building it either in a garage that's

506
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:21,120
got plenty of room or the basement

507
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:23,079
that's got plenty of room or maybe in a

508
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:25,119
warehouse sorry about the cops guys

509
00:17:23,078 --> 00:17:28,599
we've been taking dabs so let's build a

510
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:30,798
room we need four 1,000 watt lights and

511
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:33,359
a conditioner a way to remove the

512
00:17:30,798 --> 00:17:34,798
humidity and a way to draw in fresh air

513
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:36,599
so let's choose like I said we're going

514
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:37,679
to do the basement or a garage or

515
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:39,759
something like that that we want to

516
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:41,519
build a four light room I want to build

517
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:43,160
a room that's go ahead how big is this

518
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:46,038
room that's what I was just going to say

519
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:48,200
8 by8 because 2x4s come in 8 foot

520
00:17:46,038 --> 00:17:50,038
sections right or a 2x3 or whatever we

521
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:52,480
decide to use a 2x4 well you can get

522
00:17:50,038 --> 00:17:54,000
them in tin too but okay yeah but most

523
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,640
of us aren going to have a 10ft ceiling

524
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,919
in our basement our garage so I was

525
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,840
going to just stick with the you can buy

526
00:17:56,919 --> 00:18:01,240
a bunch of 8 by eights a bunch of eight

527
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:04,119
foot 2x4s and I think you could set up

528
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:06,240
this room in a day that'd be nice yeah

529
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:08,519
you you and I could do it in probably 5

530
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,159
hours cuz we've done this enough times

531
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:13,000
uh so if you're going to use a grow Hut

532
00:18:10,159 --> 00:18:14,200
or something or a pre-made grow lab what

533
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,919
do you guys do you guys sell grow Huts

534
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:19,600
at the over at Hydro indor growing

535
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:22,799
supplies um we have grow Hut we have a

536
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:25,279
generic brand is it the grow lab um and

537
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:28,558
we have the grow Labs yeah okay um the

538
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:30,879
generic brand is different than the um

539
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:32,720
uh grow laabs I've never seen one but uh

540
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,320
we can get a really good price on them

541
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,600
all right and they're just basic you

542
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:38,759
know I use the grow laabs uh that's what

543
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:41,079
I think they're grow laab 120s or

544
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:43,119
something like that or the 5x5 those are

545
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:44,599
sweet same thing throw 1,000 watt light

546
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:47,399
in there and those are awesome they also

547
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:49,240
make a 10x10 one which would work

548
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,880
perfectly uh for what we're going to

549
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:52,839
talk about here it would be we're going

550
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,760
to basically build an 8 by8 version of

551
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:57,480
that 10 by it's 10 by 10 ft x 10 ft by 6

552
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:59,599
high I think or seven High we're just

553
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:02,400
going to make an 8 by 8 by 8 room and

554
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:04,199
one of the best ways to build a room um

555
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,038
you know even like a big huge Warehouse

556
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:11,080
what they do is essentially they build a

557
00:19:07,038 --> 00:19:13,279
gigantic grow Hut out of 2x4s and you

558
00:19:11,079 --> 00:19:16,399
know drywall and everything uh they'll

559
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:19,240
build a room inside of a room even in

560
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:21,038
like the vertical uh uh commercial

561
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:23,480
lettuce farms and stuff like that that's

562
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:25,720
they they start with these cells so you

563
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:28,240
know

564
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:30,880
um you need to you know sometimes

565
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,679
looking at had a 10x10 uh grow Hut

566
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,080
they're kind of expensive but so was

567
00:19:32,679 --> 00:19:38,280
building a 10 x10 room right and if

568
00:19:35,079 --> 00:19:40,240
you're not uh and like if you can build

569
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:41,558
a 10x10 you can build this 8 by8 room

570
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,480
you've got the tools and everything I'll

571
00:19:41,558 --> 00:19:46,359
build us a house man I don't have I me I

572
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,759
I've got basic skills but for me buying

573
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:51,000
the 10x10 Hut and snapping those pieces

574
00:19:48,759 --> 00:19:52,759
together is so much easier for me and if

575
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,679
something were to go wrong in your grow

576
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:57,038
the thing comes down in an hour you

577
00:19:54,679 --> 00:19:59,480
could have everything down concealed in

578
00:19:57,038 --> 00:20:01,079
one hour uh move it to another spot and

579
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:03,159
put it back up hopefully in another hour

580
00:20:01,079 --> 00:20:05,319
with those grow huts and if you're like

581
00:20:03,159 --> 00:20:07,559
working in a a garage or a big open

582
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:09,798
basement I mean you know it's

583
00:20:07,558 --> 00:20:11,279
just if you want to expand and stuff

584
00:20:09,798 --> 00:20:13,359
like that there there's a lot of good

585
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:15,960
reasons to have multiple rooms uh when

586
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:17,639
it comes to Pest Control uh uh equipment

587
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:20,679
failure and all kinds of stuff like that

588
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:23,080
you know it's it's good to double up uh

589
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:24,880
I agree completely uh if you get bugs

590
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:26,119
over in this room or if you have an

591
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,520
equipment like you said if the air

592
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:29,558
conditioner fails in this room it didn't

593
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:31,599
fail in every room only failed in one

594
00:20:29,558 --> 00:20:34,519
light or four lights worth of stuff you

595
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:36,079
only murdered 30 plants instead of a 100

596
00:20:34,519 --> 00:20:37,879
all right so I'm glad Jesse said that

597
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:39,798
part about building a room within a room

598
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:41,640
uh he comes in handy sometimes CU most

599
00:20:39,798 --> 00:20:42,918
of what I wrote was about building a

600
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,679
room inside of a room I was going to say

601
00:20:42,919 --> 00:20:46,919
frame out of 8 by8 room that's nice and

602
00:20:44,679 --> 00:20:48,320
tall I was going to say try to leave as

603
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:49,600
much head room as you can but most of us

604
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:51,798
are going to be in a basement or garage

605
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:54,038
so we'll be limited on space and then I

606
00:20:51,798 --> 00:20:55,639
said if you can use the full uh 8 foot

607
00:20:54,038 --> 00:20:56,919
2x4s you're in good luck so frame out

608
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:59,280
your 8 by 8 by eight room wherever

609
00:20:56,919 --> 00:21:00,960
you're working and then here's where I

610
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:02,798
kind of start getting into detail since

611
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:05,240
Jesse kind of I'm so glad you said build

612
00:21:02,798 --> 00:21:06,798
a room inside of a room most of what I

613
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:08,120
wrote is build a room inside of a room

614
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:10,440
even like

615
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:11,918
uh big like restaurants and old

616
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:14,360
buildings and stuff like that that's how

617
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:15,960
they you know make it sanitary yeah make

618
00:21:14,359 --> 00:21:17,240
it look all nice just build a shell it's

619
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:19,558
called over

620
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:21,319
framing all right so overframe yourself

621
00:21:19,558 --> 00:21:22,918
a nice room all right you got an 8 by8

622
00:21:21,319 --> 00:21:25,319
room just framed you don't need to frame

623
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:28,679
it like super rigidly secure you just

624
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:31,960
need a couple of cross beams yeah 24 in

625
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:33,600
studs every 24 inches so have Jesse or I

626
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:36,759
stand every 24 inches is what he's

627
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:38,278
saying you need to stud every 24 inches

628
00:21:36,759 --> 00:21:41,960
plan for a door sometimes you guys

629
00:21:38,278 --> 00:21:43,119
forget doors uh the hydro Shop sell I

630
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:45,038
don't know if you guys have this yet but

631
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:46,519
I've seen this at plent okay they it's

632
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:48,200
like a sticker you stick it right on

633
00:21:46,519 --> 00:21:49,440
your on the myar we're going to talk or

634
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,840
not the myar the poly we're going to

635
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,440
talk about later and then you use a

636
00:21:50,839 --> 00:21:54,359
razor and you unzip the zipper and as

637
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:55,440
you unzip it you just follow your razor

638
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:57,639
right along with it and cut a hole in

639
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:00,960
the poly and now you have a zipper door

640
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:02,880
do not unzip it before you stick it

641
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,679
on has that

642
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,760
happened okay we're just going to move

643
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:08,200
on because we don't want to make fun of

644
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:09,400
your customer that did that uh you're

645
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,360
going to need to put some beams across

646
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:13,798
the top to hang your equipment so now

647
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:17,319
you've got this 8 by8 building just just

648
00:22:13,798 --> 00:22:18,319
a frame um studs every 24 in maybe a

649
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:21,879
couple across because you're going to

650
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:23,839
hang some equipment uh the uh roof beams

651
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:26,400
well it depending on if you go all the

652
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:29,399
way to the to the ceiling um if you

653
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:31,640
don't go all the way to the ceiling um

654
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:35,000
just stand your don't lay them down

655
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:36,960
stand your 2x4s up on the skinny Edge um

656
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,278
get you some metal clamps and screw them

657
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:43,440
to the the top of two walls and it'll

658
00:22:40,278 --> 00:22:45,119
help support the brace everything and

659
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,919
you can hang lights from it all kinds of

660
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:47,959
neat [ __ ] that's why we brought Jesse

661
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:50,480
that's why he's here it's why you pay

662
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:52,798
him the big bucks all right so once

663
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,079
everything's framed up uh you can

664
00:22:52,798 --> 00:22:55,720
insulate the room with the blue

665
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:57,678
insulation boards if you want to make it

666
00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:00,120
more soundproof and more uh have more

667
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:01,840
stable Temps I don't find that to be too

668
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:03,319
necessary if you're in a basement if

669
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:05,599
you're in the garage maybe because it's

670
00:23:03,319 --> 00:23:06,839
going to get colder yeah in the winter

671
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:08,678
and hotter in the summer but the

672
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:11,158
basement like we talked about stays

673
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:12,640
fairly cool most of the time uh some

674
00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:14,240
people choose to use plywood or some

675
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,038
type of board on the walls whatever you

676
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,278
want is cool build it how you like at

677
00:23:16,038 --> 00:23:19,519
that point but once you've decided on

678
00:23:17,278 --> 00:23:22,119
the walls and insulation that's when we

679
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:24,839
hang uh we call it poly or Panda

680
00:23:22,119 --> 00:23:26,278
film uh PO is basically plastic sheeting

681
00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:29,519
that's white on one side and black on

682
00:23:26,278 --> 00:23:31,119
the other now you hang the white side on

683
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:33,400
the inside of the room and the black

684
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:34,719
side on the outside of the room uh it'll

685
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,400
the white will keep the reflection of

686
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,200
your light in there and give you more

687
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,440
efficiency uh you need to cover up the

688
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:42,200
whole room the walls the floor and the

689
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:44,519
ceiling and seal it up with tape seal up

690
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,960
any spots where bugs can get in uh any

691
00:23:44,519 --> 00:23:48,400
spots where light can get out you want

692
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:51,519
it to be a little Fortress that's its

693
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:53,480
own private little room you want to seal

694
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:54,918
that [ __ ] up and the the more time you

695
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:56,798
take and the tighter you get all the

696
00:23:54,919 --> 00:23:58,840
plastic and everything there's less of a

697
00:23:56,798 --> 00:24:01,119
spot for

698
00:23:58,839 --> 00:24:02,678
um bugs to get and stuff like that like

699
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:04,839
yes take your time with this stuff take

700
00:24:02,679 --> 00:24:06,480
your time with it uh if you can if you

701
00:24:04,839 --> 00:24:07,918
have a little bit of overlap everywhere

702
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,919
there's some kind of Gap that's a good

703
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:11,720
idea when you're putting your Staples in

704
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:13,600
put down a little square of duct tape

705
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:14,919
yep and then the staple yeah yeah

706
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:16,719
because that'll help from the poly

707
00:24:14,919 --> 00:24:18,759
tearing it'll also keep the Staple in a

708
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:23,440
little bit better you can also go back

709
00:24:18,759 --> 00:24:28,119
and take a uh little bit of silicone

710
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:30,038
cocking um and uh um stick that right

711
00:24:28,119 --> 00:24:32,158
over the staple had to make sure I got

712
00:24:30,038 --> 00:24:33,798
that l in there yeah yeah you don't want

713
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:35,840
to have your [ __ ] out in the grow room

714
00:24:33,798 --> 00:24:37,158
yeah all right so now you've basically

715
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:38,879
built a little grow Hut like we were

716
00:24:37,159 --> 00:24:40,000
talking about um most of what we're

717
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,200
going to talk about now works in the

718
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,278
grow huts and it translates it kind of

719
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,880
translates to if you're just working

720
00:24:43,278 --> 00:24:46,599
with a bedroom also if you'd haven't

721
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,919
built a room the main difference is you

722
00:24:46,599 --> 00:24:49,678
won't have the buffer zone around the

723
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:50,960
grow area if you're in a bedroom you'll

724
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:53,360
need to vent out of the room or the

725
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,480
house without anybody noticing uh the

726
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:56,199
room that we've built inside of the

727
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,558
rooms gives you more privacy and I feel

728
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:01,399
like a little bit more control should we

729
00:24:58,558 --> 00:25:04,359
uh go over a bedroom uh how to vent out

730
00:25:01,398 --> 00:25:06,759
a window real seat uh schnazzy like real

731
00:25:04,359 --> 00:25:08,959
quick I think I talk a little bit about

732
00:25:06,759 --> 00:25:11,079
it

733
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,480
um yeah we can talk about it and if when

734
00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:16,639
I get to it later on we'll just skip it

735
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:18,558
later okay so crack your window open um

736
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:21,200
half inch inch kind of depends on how

737
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:23,359
much air flow you need through it uh and

738
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:25,519
then screw it shut

739
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:27,759
um or at least screw it to where it

740
00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:29,158
can't be opened any further and you do

741
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:32,640
that by

742
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:34,760
uh real gently running a nice 3-in screw

743
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:38,240
through the uh most people have vinyl

744
00:25:34,759 --> 00:25:39,879
windows um through the the inside uh

745
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,839
track of where the window goes up and

746
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:44,000
down that'll hold the window shut keep

747
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:46,879
someone from ripping it open then you

748
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:50,200
take your your W window blinds get you a

749
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:52,720
nice new set of mini blinds cheap ones

750
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:55,679
um throw that down close them so that

751
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:58,440
you know no light can go through um

752
00:25:55,679 --> 00:26:00,840
maybe leave them open a qu inch at

753
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:03,440
bottom uh air will still suck through it

754
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:06,278
pretty pretty good um and then take

755
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:08,759
Panda film put the white side to the

756
00:26:06,278 --> 00:26:11,240
outside of the window staple it over

757
00:26:08,759 --> 00:26:13,839
that and then take you a piece of

758
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:16,679
plywood screw it up over the wall and

759
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:18,678
you can cut holes and mount uh Mount

760
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:20,720
fans on there and all your ducting and

761
00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:22,480
everything there you go yeah so you can

762
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,519
use one window as an intake and one

763
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:27,679
windows and exhaust have you ever done

764
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:28,960
the thing where you uh put the blinds up

765
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:30,919
just like you said

766
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,360
uh I would close the window or leave it

767
00:26:30,919 --> 00:26:33,440
open just a little bit okay we got to

768
00:26:32,359 --> 00:26:35,639
leave it open for what we're doing on

769
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:38,080
this one sorry too many ideas in my head

770
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:41,120
uh you leave the half inch Gap and then

771
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:43,439
you build basically a box around the

772
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:46,000
window so you take some plywood and you

773
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,679
make like three inch deep little square

774
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,319
around the the like an inch around the

775
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:51,480
window and then you put a piece of

776
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:53,119
plywood over that and then you can put

777
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,480
all your ducting in that Plywood And it

778
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:55,959
almost looks like you could put like a

779
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,960
Christmas light or a candle light or

780
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,759
something in there and it looks like

781
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,200
somebody's home all the time and it just

782
00:26:58,759 --> 00:27:02,480
makes it look like you got a light you

783
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:04,720
know just like it's the room and you can

784
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,919
actually use that as ducting and [ __ ]

785
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,319
too now because it's open I did one I I

786
00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:10,759
actually stuck a Christmas light in

787
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:12,960
there a yellow one and it reflected off

788
00:27:10,759 --> 00:27:14,679
all the plastic and everything enough to

789
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,519
you know you could just flip it on is on

790
00:27:14,679 --> 00:27:18,080
a little timer and everything and then

791
00:27:16,519 --> 00:27:19,158
now you've got a a window open and it

792
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:20,199
looks like somebody's home you got a

793
00:27:19,159 --> 00:27:22,240
light on in there and it looks like it's

794
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:23,919
just part of the normal yeah so if

795
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:26,240
you're I have no idea why we would need

796
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:28,759
to be that

797
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:30,399
secretive you know it's mostly uh I'm

798
00:27:28,759 --> 00:27:31,839
not worried as worried about the police

799
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:34,038
as I am about the thieves I actually

800
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:35,759
heard a story about some thieves getting

801
00:27:34,038 --> 00:27:37,278
into somebody's air they went in through

802
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:39,679
their house through the air conditioning

803
00:27:37,278 --> 00:27:42,919
duct and were taking their plants while

804
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:44,159
the people were home oh wow they found

805
00:27:42,919 --> 00:27:47,000
out and I shouldn't even be talking

806
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:48,519
about this cuz now whatever but uh the

807
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,519
people found out their plants were being

808
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:51,960
stolen because of the cops knocked on

809
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:54,720
the door and found kids running out

810
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:56,240
their backyard with pot plants oh God

811
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,839
yeah right I don't know how that story

812
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:02,079
ended I bailed on that conversation

813
00:27:58,839 --> 00:28:03,480
yeah scary [ __ ] all right so I hope my

814
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:05,278
story about building the Box around the

815
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:06,480
window makes sense it's I kind of had a

816
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:08,038
vague idea of how to do that in my head

817
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,120
I was thinking too many thoughts so you

818
00:28:08,038 --> 00:28:12,079
take a just shape the the size of the

819
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:14,239
window you add an inch square so now if

820
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:16,759
your window is 24x 24 you make it 25 by

821
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:18,679
25 square piece of plywood and then you

822
00:28:16,759 --> 00:28:20,240
make a freaking box out of it you know

823
00:28:18,679 --> 00:28:21,640
what I mean like a half box so it's only

824
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,960
you only need it 3 inches deep make a

825
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:25,880
little tray and then put that up against

826
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:27,399
the window and then you can put a

827
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:29,679
curtain and just make it look like it's

828
00:28:27,398 --> 00:28:31,319
a real window yeah it works you guys can

829
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:32,440
math that out in your brain I hope sorry

830
00:28:31,319 --> 00:28:33,759
I wrote a bunch of [ __ ] and that's not

831
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,919
on all my notes you're just messing with

832
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:37,519
my brain

833
00:28:34,919 --> 00:28:41,320
man let's see where was I on all these

834
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:44,079
papers I hate uh I hate sloppy uh

835
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:45,918
Windows um I've actually seen a few

836
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:47,720
houses around town drive around you're

837
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:49,880
like oh yeah there's one I know what

838
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:51,480
that is come on man there there's

839
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:53,360
actually two I can drive to right now

840
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,519
and be like grow house yeah right there

841
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:55,278
you can always see the metal highlight

842
00:28:54,519 --> 00:28:58,440
in the

843
00:28:55,278 --> 00:29:00,519
Attic all right

844
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:02,640
so hang that poly real carefully Like

845
00:29:00,519 --> 00:29:04,759
Jesse said take your time with the poly

846
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,919
this is the building of the room these

847
00:29:04,759 --> 00:29:07,679
are your walls you wouldn't build your

848
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:10,880
house wall is all shitty you want your

849
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:12,519
plant room nice um cover the whole room

850
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,919
seal it up seal any spots where [ __ ] can

851
00:29:12,519 --> 00:29:16,079
get in now we basically you got that

852
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:17,278
little grut uh we're talking about a

853
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:19,879
bedroom I think I already did most of

854
00:29:17,278 --> 00:29:21,119
with the part I'm talking about uh more

855
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,600
privacy so now you got the room built

856
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:23,959
and sealed up if you're going to use a

857
00:29:22,599 --> 00:29:27,038
bedroom make sure to clean and dust the

858
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:28,960
bedroom first get onliner oh yeah yeah

859
00:29:27,038 --> 00:29:30,079
that's definitely on my list [ __ ] uh

860
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,399
cover the windows where the light can

861
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:34,678
get in or get out cover any cracks if

862
00:29:32,398 --> 00:29:36,239
you got cracks in the walls cover those

863
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:37,919
uh cover all your walls in the bedroom

864
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:40,079
with reflective material the panda film

865
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:42,038
Works in a bedroom also pull up the

866
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:43,519
carpet if you have that option cover the

867
00:29:42,038 --> 00:29:45,960
floor if possible and right here I wrote

868
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:48,679
I like a pond liner for my floor um I

869
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:50,640
like to get the pond liner about 3 to 4

870
00:29:48,679 --> 00:29:52,559
in up the wall all the way around the

871
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,038
room so if you do accidentally flood

872
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:56,119
your res in that room or you spill a

873
00:29:54,038 --> 00:29:58,079
bucket or something that's cool you just

874
00:29:56,119 --> 00:30:01,038
got a pond liner there to catch it all

875
00:29:58,079 --> 00:30:03,278
and in the doorway there uh to help keep

876
00:30:01,038 --> 00:30:04,640
the doorway all sealed up just cut you a

877
00:30:03,278 --> 00:30:07,919
door a

878
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:11,120
2x4 um is wide as your doorway stand it

879
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:13,000
up on the outside and screw it in place

880
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:15,398
and then that's a place to staple your

881
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:18,398
pond liner too yeah so it turns the

882
00:30:15,398 --> 00:30:19,678
whole little bedroom into a pond you

883
00:30:18,398 --> 00:30:21,518
know you're going to have to step up

884
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:22,759
when you go in and out but you know big

885
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:24,480
deal I like the way you did that because

886
00:30:22,759 --> 00:30:27,319
I did it kind of a shitty way in my my

887
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:29,960
newest build it works but I didn't do it

888
00:30:27,319 --> 00:30:30,678
that smooth

889
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:33,440
this

890
00:30:30,679 --> 00:30:35,159
guy a nice little air seal if you put it

891
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,840
real tight and everything put a piece of

892
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:38,200
foam in there and that's something we're

893
00:30:36,839 --> 00:30:39,558
going to talk a little bit about because

894
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:41,278
some of us are going to have to use that

895
00:30:39,558 --> 00:30:43,519
crevice underneath the door to let air

896
00:30:41,278 --> 00:30:45,798
in yeah true that's actually a pretty

897
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:48,599
good spot if for some of us and that's

898
00:30:45,798 --> 00:30:51,398
guys everything I'm talking about is uh

899
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:53,278
under ideal conditions yeah this I mean

900
00:30:51,398 --> 00:30:55,000
there's I'm just trying to throw out

901
00:30:53,278 --> 00:30:57,200
ideals out there cuz there's so many

902
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,679
ways you could use I mean and so much

903
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,960
that different

904
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:02,159
if you walked

905
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:03,720
into okay this is a four bedroom house

906
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:05,120
if we walked into all four bedrooms and

907
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:06,798
tried to build a grow room in it we'd

908
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:08,638
have to deal with different obstacles in

909
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:10,519
every single room each room would have

910
00:31:08,638 --> 00:31:12,558
different [ __ ] to deal with yeah that

911
00:31:10,519 --> 00:31:14,000
room's only got a window on that side

912
00:31:12,558 --> 00:31:14,798
that room you can't mess with the window

913
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,798
because it's right up against the

914
00:31:14,798 --> 00:31:18,278
neighbor's house if you exhaust out

915
00:31:16,798 --> 00:31:20,759
there you're going to be blowing heat

916
00:31:18,278 --> 00:31:23,679
into the neighbor's window basically so

917
00:31:20,759 --> 00:31:24,638
there'd be some obstacles yeah all right

918
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:25,720
so wherever you are you're going to have

919
00:31:24,638 --> 00:31:27,638
to deal with some [ __ ] everything we're

920
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:28,960
saying is just kind of kind of hopefully

921
00:31:27,638 --> 00:31:30,479
going to work for what we're doing so

922
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,440
now we've got this clean room basically

923
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,919
we've got a Hut that's sealed up uh

924
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:37,639
we're going to add so you got your 8 by8

925
00:31:34,919 --> 00:31:39,320
by8 room it's all Panda filmed or you've

926
00:31:37,638 --> 00:31:41,278
got a 10 x10 grow Hut or whatever

927
00:31:39,319 --> 00:31:43,200
something similar uh now this is where

928
00:31:41,278 --> 00:31:45,119
you want to add an intake and an outtake

929
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,440
uh I talked in that last episode a lot

930
00:31:45,119 --> 00:31:48,959
about how important it is to vent you

931
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:51,558
the air in your grow I like those inline

932
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:53,840
style fans or blowers I like the vortex

933
00:31:51,558 --> 00:31:55,519
Vortex has always been reliable the can

934
00:31:53,839 --> 00:31:57,599
fan is great they're a little more

935
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:59,880
expensive but they're adjustable speed

936
00:31:57,599 --> 00:32:01,839
and dude those are reliable uh those

937
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:04,200
green h Hydrofarm blowers those are

938
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:06,079
reliable they work but they're loud yeah

939
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:09,319
they're really loud and they're the

940
00:32:06,079 --> 00:32:13,278
green hydrarm inline boosters are

941
00:32:09,319 --> 00:32:15,158
junk all right yeah don't waste your

942
00:32:13,278 --> 00:32:16,679
money on them Jesse works at a hydro

943
00:32:15,159 --> 00:32:18,720
shop and I was not going to bash any

944
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:20,000
brand but since he works there and has

945
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,200
to order from them we'll let him go

946
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,159
ahead and talk

947
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:28,120
[ __ ] yeah well I mean it is what it is

948
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:30,200
they there's a reason they sell uh um so

949
00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:32,879
many refurbished ones of those that's a

950
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:36,038
lot of grow stores who get the uh Hydro

951
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:37,720
Farm no I just better shut up yeah all

952
00:32:36,038 --> 00:32:40,119
of what he says is allegedly and I am

953
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:41,319
not responsible for that I like uh for

954
00:32:40,119 --> 00:32:44,158
for the room we're going to build we

955
00:32:41,319 --> 00:32:45,960
need an 8 in blower um I'm going to say

956
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:50,000
get a can fan or a Vortex and don't buy

957
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:51,600
one of the green hydrarm ones get a um

958
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,599
get if you can afford the can fan get

959
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:57,319
that the vortex is ideal next so yeah

960
00:32:54,599 --> 00:32:59,359
the hydrarm blowers are great it's the

961
00:32:57,319 --> 00:33:01,000
the booster you know the ones that the

962
00:32:59,359 --> 00:33:03,000
one that go in the ducting yeah yeah

963
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,319
those those are all crap no matter who

964
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,960
makes them those are all crap I think

965
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:10,119
can fans isn't bad but okay it's that's

966
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:12,798
not a primary fan you know it says

967
00:33:10,119 --> 00:33:14,158
booster on the box so okay all right

968
00:33:12,798 --> 00:33:15,158
yeah if you got the right blower you

969
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:17,519
don't need the

970
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:19,720
booster so add that uh let's see where

971
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:21,440
were we 8 inch blower attach the blower

972
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:23,200
uh to the framing and get it fairly high

973
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,320
in the room depending on where you are

974
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,759
some of you guys might need to do this

975
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:27,200
in the dead center of the room some of

976
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:29,398
you may need to do it off to a corner

977
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,919
just try to get High uh I think it's

978
00:33:29,398 --> 00:33:32,759
better to get the heat high it's better

979
00:33:30,919 --> 00:33:34,639
to dump it out of the room High I like

980
00:33:32,759 --> 00:33:37,480
to do everything

981
00:33:34,638 --> 00:33:38,599
High all right so now this is when you

982
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:41,200
need to decide if you're going to use

983
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:43,158
vented hoods or open hoods uh vented

984
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,840
hoods are the ones uh just for the

985
00:33:43,159 --> 00:33:47,159
people that are new with this your light

986
00:33:44,839 --> 00:33:48,398
reflectors and hoods vented ones mean

987
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:49,679
they have glass on the bottom and

988
00:33:48,398 --> 00:33:52,000
they're sealed and your ducting will

989
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:54,159
attach to it and the light will be moved

990
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,558
away from the grow and not dropping down

991
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:58,039
on your plants if you have open hoods

992
00:33:56,558 --> 00:34:00,119
you're going to have to have more air

993
00:33:58,038 --> 00:34:02,398
conditioning but you don't have to have

994
00:34:00,119 --> 00:34:04,119
as much ducting so that's when you need

995
00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:06,119
to think about what you got to do you

996
00:34:04,119 --> 00:34:08,319
get more value for your for your light

997
00:34:06,119 --> 00:34:10,918
that way but air conditioning is

998
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:13,079
expensive right I like the vented style

999
00:34:10,918 --> 00:34:15,398
yeah that's pretty much industry

1000
00:34:13,079 --> 00:34:16,879
standard I'd say yeah unless you're in

1001
00:34:15,398 --> 00:34:19,559
I've actually seen a couple of huge

1002
00:34:16,878 --> 00:34:24,039
rooms that just dump AC at ridiculous

1003
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:25,559
levels and it's in a couple yeah when if

1004
00:34:24,039 --> 00:34:27,878
if you're supplementing CO2 and stuff

1005
00:34:25,559 --> 00:34:29,078
you can't be exhausting a lot yeah takes

1006
00:34:27,878 --> 00:34:32,279
a little bit more

1007
00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:34,440
work um and if you're really cool kids

1008
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:36,200
you got the gavitas or the nanolas or

1009
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:38,760
something like that oh yeah those

1010
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:40,000
gavitas you can't duct those so then

1011
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,119
you're going to okay so if you're using

1012
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,000
gavitas you're going to have to use more

1013
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:46,039
air conditioning a lot more a lot more

1014
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,320
all right so if you're using open hoods

1015
00:34:46,039 --> 00:34:48,599
and you're trying for the ducting

1016
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:51,000
situation we're doing you can just

1017
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:52,599
attach a carbon filter to your 8 in

1018
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,760
blower and now you've pretty much

1019
00:34:52,599 --> 00:34:58,039
finished the extraction but if you're

1020
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,640
using uh make sure you use the carbon

1021
00:34:58,039 --> 00:35:00,719
filter also that's what I want to add

1022
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:02,118
make sure you're using the carbon filter

1023
00:35:00,719 --> 00:35:04,598
on the extraction fan cuz your crop is

1024
00:35:02,119 --> 00:35:05,599
going to stink like about week six

1025
00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:07,880
you're going to be able to smell

1026
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:09,640
everything I just hit week five in the

1027
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:12,559
middle of week five in a room and that

1028
00:35:09,639 --> 00:35:15,440
uh that Gorilla Glue number four is a

1029
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:17,400
stinky little [ __ ] oh my God so if you

1030
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,440
do use vented hoods you got to run

1031
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:22,160
ducting we're running four lights in

1032
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:23,720
this design so I would do it kind of

1033
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:25,440
like this but I'm going to take a little

1034
00:35:23,719 --> 00:35:28,799
drink of this drink first right now

1035
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,800
taking a drink

1036
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:35,960
and that was well deserved all right so

1037
00:35:33,838 --> 00:35:37,838
if we're building this room with four

1038
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:40,519
lights I would put a large carbon filter

1039
00:35:37,838 --> 00:35:42,119
I like the 39 by8 carbon filter they

1040
00:35:40,519 --> 00:35:43,358
have those available right now at hyro

1041
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:46,358
indoor growing

1042
00:35:43,358 --> 00:35:49,039
supplies then I would take that 38 by 8

1043
00:35:46,358 --> 00:35:51,358
in carb uh 39 by 8 in carbon filter I

1044
00:35:49,039 --> 00:35:54,559
would use an 8 in y duct that goes into

1045
00:35:51,358 --> 00:35:56,519
two 6in ducks so now my eight just went

1046
00:35:54,559 --> 00:35:58,239
to two sixes and I would use the Y to

1047
00:35:56,519 --> 00:36:01,838
run the ducting to two two lights on

1048
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:05,799
each side so I would have light 1 a

1049
00:36:01,838 --> 00:36:08,239
light 2 a and then light 1B Light 2 B on

1050
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:10,200
opposite sides and then use another y

1051
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:12,519
duct more ducting and then a y duct to

1052
00:36:10,199 --> 00:36:15,679
bring them back together and then attach

1053
00:36:12,519 --> 00:36:18,358
that y duct and the 8 in

1054
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:19,838
blower uh I wrote something weird

1055
00:36:18,358 --> 00:36:21,318
they're attached that Y and the 8 inch

1056
00:36:19,838 --> 00:36:22,599
blower and the blower send the air out

1057
00:36:21,318 --> 00:36:24,838
of the room something I wrote doesn't

1058
00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:27,000
make sense but attach that y duct to the

1059
00:36:24,838 --> 00:36:28,039
blower and then send the air see I

1060
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,519
already have something wrong here

1061
00:36:28,039 --> 00:36:31,559
because you should have carbon filter

1062
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:33,440
blower is the way it should go yeah so

1063
00:36:31,559 --> 00:36:37,519
it should be carbon filter blower

1064
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:40,559
ducting or carbon filter blower y

1065
00:36:37,519 --> 00:36:42,880
ducting light light Y and then out of

1066
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:44,719
the house yeah is where it should go I

1067
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,200
type something different but I must have

1068
00:36:44,719 --> 00:36:48,639
just been high at that

1069
00:36:46,199 --> 00:36:50,639
time that'd be a good spot for a booster

1070
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:52,838
fan that right at the end there would be

1071
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:54,639
the perfect spot uh so in this case

1072
00:36:52,838 --> 00:36:57,119
we're running it out of the grow Hut or

1073
00:36:54,639 --> 00:36:58,639
out of this 8 by8 room that we built or

1074
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:00,280
if you're in the bedroom that's when you

1075
00:36:58,639 --> 00:37:01,960
got to build that little wall and

1076
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:03,839
running out of that duct or that little

1077
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:06,079
box that we made

1078
00:37:03,838 --> 00:37:09,039
there that was a good burp I'm glad I

1079
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:10,280
got that one off the microphone um in

1080
00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:11,719
some cases you're going to need to run

1081
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:13,800
the ducting out of the house or to

1082
00:37:11,719 --> 00:37:16,078
another room uh booster fans come in

1083
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:18,359
handy there try to keep the uh the

1084
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:19,640
ducting as short and straight as

1085
00:37:18,358 --> 00:37:20,920
possible you don't want a lot of bends

1086
00:37:19,639 --> 00:37:24,480
in your ducting and you don't want

1087
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:27,280
excessive long ducting also if you can

1088
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:28,960
hang your carbon filter from the ceiling

1089
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:31,599
yeah because all of your heat and stale

1090
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:35,240
air is going to go up hopefully air

1091
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:38,318
moves just like water so you know if you

1092
00:37:35,239 --> 00:37:40,318
got to um pump it all the way to the

1093
00:37:38,318 --> 00:37:43,159
ceiling from the floor you know that's

1094
00:37:40,318 --> 00:37:45,199
just uh stealing energy there you go and

1095
00:37:43,159 --> 00:37:47,159
heat rises so you put that thing up

1096
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:50,000
there and you're yeah and then it won't

1097
00:37:47,159 --> 00:37:53,000
suck stinks more too so yes that's very

1098
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,719
true stick it on the ceiling yeah uh and

1099
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,079
your carbon filter will work better if

1100
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:58,318
you keep the humidity at a more

1101
00:37:56,079 --> 00:38:00,079
acceptable level get it closer to 50 get

1102
00:37:58,318 --> 00:38:01,400
away from that 70% like I've seen a

1103
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:03,160
couple of guys in their flower rooms at

1104
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:05,519
70% humidity cuz they say it makes the

1105
00:38:03,159 --> 00:38:07,440
bud sticky it'll make your bud moldy as

1106
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:11,000
what you're going to get bro I've seen

1107
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:13,119
flower rooms with 0% humidity so much

1108
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,440
good old Southern Colorado fres just

1109
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:17,000
going to say it's Colorado bro don't

1110
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:18,679
look at me like that and then your

1111
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:22,039
carbon filter pretty much quits working

1112
00:38:18,679 --> 00:38:23,838
at that point too yeah yeah you need

1113
00:38:22,039 --> 00:38:25,599
some some moisture to keep that charcoal

1114
00:38:23,838 --> 00:38:28,000
active dear God all right so we've got

1115
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:29,760
an exhaust set up now you need air in

1116
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,000
uh depending on the situation I might

1117
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:35,800
make uh a 4in hole 6 in from the corners

1118
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,318
and 6 in off the ground uh so imagine

1119
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:41,119
there's the corner of the room I would

1120
00:38:37,318 --> 00:38:42,960
go 6 in in and 6 in up and make a 4in

1121
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:44,119
hole and then on the opposite side of

1122
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,280
that corner do the same thing and

1123
00:38:44,119 --> 00:38:48,358
that'll give you eight 4in holes for

1124
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:49,839
fresh air uh then I go and get those

1125
00:38:48,358 --> 00:38:51,598
HEPA filters from Lowe's they're just

1126
00:38:49,838 --> 00:38:55,358
little square sheets and I staple those

1127
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:58,039
over the holes to keep any dirt bugs uh

1128
00:38:55,358 --> 00:38:59,119
freaking dog hair hippie hair keep all

1129
00:38:58,039 --> 00:39:00,400
that [ __ ] out of the grow room with

1130
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:02,880
those Hippa filters they work pretty

1131
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,800
well uh I use dryer vents to cover and

1132
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:07,519
prevent light leaks um right on the

1133
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:09,200
outside I put those on the outside uh to

1134
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:10,318
where or you can put them on the inside

1135
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:11,960
too if you need to but I like them on

1136
00:39:10,318 --> 00:39:13,358
the outside they just look smoother but

1137
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:14,720
you know the inside may work cuz now the

1138
00:39:13,358 --> 00:39:16,639
lights coming this way it's not going to

1139
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:18,559
get in there if you're using them for an

1140
00:39:16,639 --> 00:39:22,000
intake don't forget to take the little

1141
00:39:18,559 --> 00:39:24,480
flapper out yeah I've actually heard one

1142
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,480
going and I like what what is that no oh

1143
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:28,800
[ __ ] I forgot to take that out yeah um

1144
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:30,480
you could replace the small holes with

1145
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,039
one big hole and you can have a blower

1146
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:34,639
in there if you do have something

1147
00:39:32,039 --> 00:39:36,519
bringing air in make sure that it is

1148
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:38,960
smaller than the exhaust fan you want to

1149
00:39:36,519 --> 00:39:40,318
suck out more than what you're bringing

1150
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,240
in you want to create negative pressure

1151
00:39:40,318 --> 00:39:43,800
in a grow room you want it to feel if

1152
00:39:42,239 --> 00:39:45,439
you have a real door if it's in a

1153
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,640
bedroom when you open the door you want

1154
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,880
the you want to turn the knob and you

1155
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:49,838
want the door to fly open on its own

1156
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,358
that's how you know you got enough

1157
00:39:49,838 --> 00:39:54,480
pressure in a grow room positive

1158
00:39:51,358 --> 00:39:57,039
pressure is that that's negative sucking

1159
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:58,679
oh yeah yeah never mind yeah I I was

1160
00:39:57,039 --> 00:40:00,838
actually thinking of a room I was just

1161
00:39:58,679 --> 00:40:02,039
in so the door would have been yeah

1162
00:40:00,838 --> 00:40:04,239
never

1163
00:40:02,039 --> 00:40:06,079
mind we'll catch up we'll get you on the

1164
00:40:04,239 --> 00:40:10,239
same show well I'm doing episode 39 I

1165
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:12,440
don't know what number you're on 42

1166
00:40:10,239 --> 00:40:14,078
man all right so now

1167
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:15,679
we've guys I wonder what's going to

1168
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:18,000
happen on episode 42 because Jesse just

1169
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:19,519
jumped to the Future on me it clicked in

1170
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,358
my brain a second late I was like wait

1171
00:40:19,519 --> 00:40:22,599
man we got to catch up all right so you

1172
00:40:21,358 --> 00:40:24,318
can replace all those holes with a big

1173
00:40:22,599 --> 00:40:26,039
blower uh you've got fresh air being

1174
00:40:24,318 --> 00:40:27,358
pulled in when the exhaust van pulls out

1175
00:40:26,039 --> 00:40:29,159
Stella air and humidity out of the room

1176
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:30,799
room and out of the house what does that

1177
00:40:29,159 --> 00:40:32,159
even mean you can tell I was lit when I

1178
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:35,318
wrote some of these notes and it got

1179
00:40:32,159 --> 00:40:37,239
late uh so we got fresh air coming in uh

1180
00:40:35,318 --> 00:40:39,440
when the exhaust fan pulls the stale air

1181
00:40:37,239 --> 00:40:41,279
and humidity out of the room so you can

1182
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:43,200
add an air conditioner to bring in fresh

1183
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:46,200
air also uh you might be able to bring

1184
00:40:43,199 --> 00:40:49,559
in enough air under the bedroom door if

1185
00:40:46,199 --> 00:40:50,960
you're doing this in a bedroom um I had

1186
00:40:49,559 --> 00:40:52,920
a perfect little girl when I first

1187
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,519
started off it was in a bedroom and I

1188
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:56,480
had the blower going over one light I

1189
00:40:54,519 --> 00:40:57,960
had a 6-in blower I was going over two

1190
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:00,318
lights and sucking straight out of the

1191
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:01,679
room and I hung a carbon filter in the

1192
00:41:00,318 --> 00:41:03,719
ceiling and I just let the fresh air

1193
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:06,239
come right under the door and I feel

1194
00:41:03,719 --> 00:41:08,039
like it was enough air nice yeah yeah I

1195
00:41:06,239 --> 00:41:10,279
feel like it was sufficient in there it

1196
00:41:08,039 --> 00:41:11,759
didn't get stifled or anything in there

1197
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:13,440
so that space under the door guys that

1198
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,720
could be useful you need fresh air

1199
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:17,039
coming in so if you're building this big

1200
00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:19,159
8 by8 room cut some holes in there or

1201
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:21,119
add a blower if you're using an 8 in

1202
00:41:19,159 --> 00:41:23,118
blower out you can use a four or a 6in

1203
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:25,559
blower in I think and you'll be just

1204
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:27,358
fine and even if you're running a sealed

1205
00:41:25,559 --> 00:41:29,880
room I hate seeing this this is a a

1206
00:41:27,358 --> 00:41:33,880
little more advanced stuff but um even

1207
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:36,240
sealed rooms need to have the ability to

1208
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:39,440
inject fresh air

1209
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:41,439
um you know even if you don't use it but

1210
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:44,639
once a week or something like that it's

1211
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:48,679
you still need to recycle your air every

1212
00:41:44,639 --> 00:41:50,679
now and then pumping CO2 into air it's I

1213
00:41:48,679 --> 00:41:52,440
don't know I I know uh do you know what

1214
00:41:50,679 --> 00:41:55,078
I mean I know what you mean uh he's

1215
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:56,960
talking about a uh control a closed

1216
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:58,440
environment agriculture room where

1217
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:00,400
everything is sealed up the only air

1218
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:01,960
that goes in the room is CO2 that's

1219
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,200
supplemented with the CO2 tank we'll

1220
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:06,358
talk a little bit about that in the

1221
00:42:03,199 --> 00:42:08,679
future um because plants actually breed

1222
00:42:06,358 --> 00:42:10,598
CO2 and let out oxygen but I think just

1223
00:42:08,679 --> 00:42:12,199
pumping all that CO2 in there they are

1224
00:42:10,599 --> 00:42:14,960
going to need some oxygen your roots

1225
00:42:12,199 --> 00:42:17,239
need oxygen your micro it gets stale in

1226
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:19,039
there yeah yeah so I agree you have to

1227
00:42:17,239 --> 00:42:21,318
put some oxygen in that closed room

1228
00:42:19,039 --> 00:42:23,679
somehow and just use those Hippa filters

1229
00:42:21,318 --> 00:42:26,000
and filter your air they also sell those

1230
00:42:23,679 --> 00:42:27,639
shroom things the shroom covers I'm a

1231
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,639
big fan of those okay

1232
00:42:27,639 --> 00:42:30,118
I've always thought they were a little

1233
00:42:28,639 --> 00:42:32,000
overpriced so I've just stuck with the

1234
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:37,160
hip of filters I can't argue with that

1235
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:40,400
yeah so yeah um we sell a much bigger

1236
00:42:37,159 --> 00:42:44,719
intake filter that's uh similar to a

1237
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:49,318
carbon filter and uh um you know it's

1238
00:42:44,719 --> 00:42:51,639
not applicable in all situations but um

1239
00:42:49,318 --> 00:42:55,039
it's very reasonably priced for what it

1240
00:42:51,639 --> 00:42:57,519
is the lifespan it's just touch over 100

1241
00:42:55,039 --> 00:43:00,199
and it does some serious filtering so

1242
00:42:57,519 --> 00:43:01,838
you can bring air from outside into your

1243
00:43:00,199 --> 00:43:03,439
grow essentially if you filter it with

1244
00:43:01,838 --> 00:43:06,159
that okay [ __ ] that's worth a ton of

1245
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:09,559
money it looks like a gigantic uh k&amp; air

1246
00:43:06,159 --> 00:43:12,440
K&amp;N air filter for like a freaking F22

1247
00:43:09,559 --> 00:43:12,440
Raptor or some

1248
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:17,159
[ __ ] oh I wonder God imagine when you're

1249
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:20,039
done with that thing you go dump it in

1250
00:43:17,159 --> 00:43:21,639
the [ __ ] oops $5 you go dump it in

1251
00:43:20,039 --> 00:43:22,800
the [ __ ] landfill I'm not doing that

1252
00:43:21,639 --> 00:43:25,000
anymore I just called it was over I'm

1253
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,880
glad you go dump in the landfill and you

1254
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,400
set it down I'm just picturing like some

1255
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:30,000
sort of Breaking Bad desert is where I

1256
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,240
was watching somebody in my mind dump it

1257
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,480
like throws it down in the desert and

1258
00:43:31,239 --> 00:43:34,799
all these bugs and like imagine all the

1259
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:37,318
crazy [ __ ] that's going to come out cuz

1260
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:39,839
you got a blower attached to it sucking

1261
00:43:37,318 --> 00:43:41,358
every bug that flies by is going to go

1262
00:43:39,838 --> 00:43:44,400
and just get sucked into that and get

1263
00:43:41,358 --> 00:43:46,759
stuck in your trap now we'll go Huck it

1264
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:49,559
over the fence at the Monsanto facility

1265
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:52,680
there we go we're coming for you

1266
00:43:49,559 --> 00:43:53,960
biological warfare we're coming for you

1267
00:43:52,679 --> 00:43:56,078
all right I'm going to try to I've got

1268
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:57,679
like three more pages of stuff typed out

1269
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:59,240
and I'm going to have to edit out the FW

1270
00:43:57,679 --> 00:44:01,960
so we're going to have to finish the

1271
00:43:59,239 --> 00:44:04,679
show pretty soon you should leave just

1272
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:06,440
that part in though I'll leave the f-

1273
00:44:04,679 --> 00:44:07,519
word in I'm done with paying $5 for it I

1274
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:08,800
already declared that earlier in the

1275
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:11,159
show we're

1276
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:12,359
cool I was just so daydreaming and

1277
00:44:11,159 --> 00:44:14,239
thinking about like where would this

1278
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:15,279
thing because you can't like I wasn't

1279
00:44:14,239 --> 00:44:16,759
picturing me and you doing it I'm

1280
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:20,319
picturing like some shady grower with

1281
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:21,680
this big gigantic vent cleaner and he's

1282
00:44:20,318 --> 00:44:23,119

00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:41,358
gross all right let me that's what I was

1290
00:44:38,719 --> 00:44:43,558
that was one thing when I was actually

1291
00:44:41,358 --> 00:44:47,078
uh researching it before we got it I was

1292
00:44:43,559 --> 00:44:50,319
like oh uh this will be great for uh out

1293
00:44:47,079 --> 00:44:55,039
protection from outdoor uh yeah uh

1294
00:44:50,318 --> 00:44:57,558
amateurs outdoor amateur pollen yeah or

1295
00:44:55,039 --> 00:44:59,400
hemp man I've got a male that might blow

1296
00:44:57,559 --> 00:45:02,359
soon you just reminded me that I did not

1297
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:04,880
move it earlier oh [ __ ] he's in a shitty

1298
00:45:02,358 --> 00:45:08,880
spot if he goes I don't want that to

1299
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:11,200
happen premature uh yeah he's in yeah I

1300
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:13,200
don't need him to go he's in a bad spot

1301
00:45:11,199 --> 00:45:14,679
all right so guys uh we've been ranting

1302
00:45:13,199 --> 00:45:16,480
here we're going to try to get back on

1303
00:45:14,679 --> 00:45:17,799
track for a little bit we got 15 more

1304
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:21,039
minutes or so before everyone's going to

1305
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:22,800
get ad kind of already happened to us uh

1306
00:45:21,039 --> 00:45:24,759
since we've got ducting in place let's

1307
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:26,720
hang up some lights guys in this room we

1308
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:28,720
have an 8 by8 footprint and four lights

1309
00:45:26,719 --> 00:45:30,159
that means means we can use a 4x4 area

1310
00:45:28,719 --> 00:45:31,838
for each light it's going to be bright

1311
00:45:30,159 --> 00:45:33,920
in here that's what we want divide the

1312
00:45:31,838 --> 00:45:36,078
room into perfect quarters find the

1313
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:38,039
center for each quarter hang your lights

1314
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:39,559
so they're centered in the corners or

1315
00:45:38,039 --> 00:45:40,920
the quarters not Corners you want them

1316
00:45:39,559 --> 00:45:44,599
centered in the

1317
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:46,159
quarters uh so basically you got a 4x4

1318
00:45:44,599 --> 00:45:48,599
section with the light perfectly above

1319
00:45:46,159 --> 00:45:50,239
it and every 4x4 space has a light right

1320
00:45:48,599 --> 00:45:51,720
above it Jesse's doing math on how many

1321
00:45:50,239 --> 00:45:53,279
lumens and how many watts per square

1322
00:45:51,719 --> 00:45:55,159
foot that is yes it's impressive you

1323
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:57,400
could do 600 watt lights in the setup if

1324
00:45:55,159 --> 00:45:58,558
you wanted thousands are the way go in

1325
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:00,880
here I

1326
00:45:58,559 --> 00:46:02,079
think that's my professional opinion if

1327
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:03,519
you've got the electricity and you're

1328
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:07,039
building this room put thousands in

1329
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:09,759
there oh yeah no I uh totally agree all

1330
00:46:07,039 --> 00:46:12,960
right I use those little uh so 64 square

1331
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:14,960
feet obviously that's simple

1332
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:18,400
math

1333
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:21,800
um I'm all stoned work a

1334
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:26,639
calculator wrong way always divide

1335
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:29,000
things the wrong way that's uh 62 uh uh

1336
00:46:26,639 --> 00:46:31,679
watch per square foot and what would be

1337
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:34,960
your recommendation Mr Hydro shop expert

1338
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:37,558
um that's a really healthy W uh per

1339
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:39,318
square foot all right yeah this is going

1340
00:46:37,559 --> 00:46:40,800
to be a healthy room hey Ryan you've got

1341
00:46:39,318 --> 00:46:42,440
a room kind of like this dude so good

1342
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:47,280
job you might have taken some advice

1343
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:50,000
from me that's no tiarra Rojo uh 120

1344
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:52,559
watts per square foot but yeah that

1345
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,519
indoor acre we were talking about a spot

1346
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:56,119
called the indoor acre is what is that

1347
00:46:54,519 --> 00:46:58,039
place is amazing there's like a mile and

1348
00:46:56,119 --> 00:47:00,160
a half of Plum in there just for the

1349
00:46:58,039 --> 00:47:02,800
hydro kit all right so we're hanging our

1350
00:47:00,159 --> 00:47:05,279
lights they're in the corner the the the

1351
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:06,400
center of the quarters of the room right

1352
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:08,200
there might be a lot of editing on this

1353
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:09,440
show guys we're dabbed out so I like to

1354
00:47:08,199 --> 00:47:10,960
use those little ey hooks I sell at

1355
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:12,679
Lowe's they're just uh screws with a

1356
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:15,519
little circle at the end of it basically

1357
00:47:12,679 --> 00:47:17,199
screw that into the ceiling uh screw it

1358
00:47:15,519 --> 00:47:19,400
directly into the ceiling beams make

1359
00:47:17,199 --> 00:47:21,879
sure you hit a stud yes well there'll

1360
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:24,119
only be studs there I mean have myar or

1361
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:25,400
a St or plastic or a stud so make sure

1362
00:47:24,119 --> 00:47:27,480
you get it in there yeah if you're in a

1363
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:28,960
bedroom though yeah yeah okay there you

1364
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:30,440
go right on I forgot about the bedroom

1365
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:32,679
actually got a quick trick for that and

1366
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:36,240
it helps you Center your lights take two

1367
00:47:32,679 --> 00:47:37,519
8ot uh 2x4s screw them to the ceiling

1368
00:47:36,239 --> 00:47:39,598
then you put your lights anywhere you

1369
00:47:37,519 --> 00:47:42,960
want you always know you hit a stud yeah

1370
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:42,960
I need to do that in one one

1371
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:51,679
area yeah I worked at a place where the

1372
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:54,079
lights were um I I worked for two

1373
00:47:51,679 --> 00:47:57,598
companies in the same building

1374
00:47:54,079 --> 00:48:00,480
ironically um and at the first company I

1375
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:02,880
didn't help set anything up um and all

1376
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:06,039
the lights were hung from a floating

1377
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:08,119
grid ceiling big old Raptor hoods uh

1378
00:48:06,039 --> 00:48:10,679
with little tiny plastic hooks is

1379
00:48:08,119 --> 00:48:13,920
absolutely like just super dangerous

1380
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:16,440
dumbass move um but uh when I went to

1381
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:19,440
work for the other company I got paid to

1382
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:23,358
do a 2x4 structure all through the that

1383
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:24,679
uh could support a couple gorillas so

1384
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:26,000
yeah guys be safe when you're building

1385
00:48:24,679 --> 00:48:27,919
stuff we've talked about not being that

1386
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,159
[ __ ] that burns down the house also

1387
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:31,519
don't be the guy that takes down the

1388
00:48:29,159 --> 00:48:32,598
bedroom on accident if you're renting

1389
00:48:31,519 --> 00:48:36,318
you're going to have to pay for whatever

1390
00:48:32,599 --> 00:48:37,920
you mess up all right um I like those

1391
00:48:36,318 --> 00:48:39,719
little light hangers to hang my lights

1392
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:41,720
the ratchet style ones those are perfect

1393
00:48:39,719 --> 00:48:43,279
I love them uh hang all four lights

1394
00:48:41,719 --> 00:48:45,519
screw in your bulbs and wipe off the

1395
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:47,720
bulbs when you're done uh wipe them off

1396
00:48:45,519 --> 00:48:48,960
I like to use like a uh it's a thing

1397
00:48:47,719 --> 00:48:50,719
that you should be cleaning your drums

1398
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:53,280
with it's a little soft uh it's like a

1399
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:55,199
microfiber Yeah clean it off with that

1400
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:56,559
sunglass stuff yeah sunglass stuff

1401
00:48:55,199 --> 00:48:59,439
exactly you don't want any scratches in

1402
00:48:56,559 --> 00:49:01,200
there uh in in the bulb or any dust or

1403
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:03,079
dirt on there or any oil from your

1404
00:49:01,199 --> 00:49:04,798
finger on there any little thing that

1405
00:49:03,079 --> 00:49:06,640
close to the bulb is going to definitely

1406
00:49:04,798 --> 00:49:09,880
kill lumens make sure your bulb is

1407
00:49:06,639 --> 00:49:11,598
screwed in completely yeah that and all

1408
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:14,440
of your connections are all pushed and

1409
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:16,240
tight on your ballast as well so screw

1410
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:19,480
in your bulbs wipe it off make sure it's

1411
00:49:16,239 --> 00:49:21,279
tight uh run the ducting from the blower

1412
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:23,240
to the Y duct to each light back to the

1413
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:25,359
other y out of your grow room and then

1414
00:49:23,239 --> 00:49:26,598
secure all of those ductings with tape

1415
00:49:25,358 --> 00:49:29,159
there's going to be a lot of pressure on

1416
00:49:26,599 --> 00:49:32,240
the the duct uh an 8 in blower puts out

1417
00:49:29,159 --> 00:49:35,960
a lot of pressure it may be a good idea

1418
00:49:32,239 --> 00:49:37,759
also to grab a fan speed controller U

1419
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:39,720
you plug that in and then you plug your

1420
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:41,920
fan into that and you can actually your

1421
00:49:39,719 --> 00:49:45,519
blower your 8 in Vortex blower you can

1422
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:47,440
adjust how much by percentage of from it

1423
00:49:45,519 --> 00:49:48,679
only works about 50% is as low as I

1424
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:51,358
think it goes but then you can go from

1425
00:49:48,679 --> 00:49:52,879
50 all the way to 100 uh if you're

1426
00:49:51,358 --> 00:49:55,639
wanting to keep a little humidity in the

1427
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:57,880
room turn it down you can get it down to

1428
00:49:55,639 --> 00:49:59,598
you know 50% % humidity turn it down to

1429
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:01,559
70% it'll help you out that's actually

1430
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:03,640
how I run it in one space at about 70%

1431
00:50:01,559 --> 00:50:06,559
all the time and so many of the can fans

1432
00:50:03,639 --> 00:50:08,639
come with the little three-speed switch

1433
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:10,680
on the cord already adjusted to it yeah

1434
00:50:08,639 --> 00:50:13,239
so that may be beneficial and the hyper

1435
00:50:10,679 --> 00:50:16,118
fan the best fan on the market in my

1436
00:50:13,239 --> 00:50:18,039
opinion it comes with one built-in ah

1437
00:50:16,119 --> 00:50:20,519
see that's a new product for me when I

1438
00:50:18,039 --> 00:50:21,960
upgrade it's time for some of those all

1439
00:50:20,519 --> 00:50:23,519
right so now we've got ducting you got

1440
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:25,358
lights hung it's kind of starting to

1441
00:50:23,519 --> 00:50:27,159
look like a grow room uh you got to hang

1442
00:50:25,358 --> 00:50:30,318
a couple fans on the walls

1443
00:50:27,159 --> 00:50:32,000
I would put fans uh right above the

1444
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:33,159
expected height of your plants like if

1445
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,798
you think your plants are going to get

1446
00:50:33,159 --> 00:50:37,558
5T tall put a fan at 5 and a half ft uh

1447
00:50:35,798 --> 00:50:39,679
right between the fan can or the light

1448
00:50:37,559 --> 00:50:41,559
canop the damn lot of words right

1449
00:50:39,679 --> 00:50:43,480
between the plant canopy and the lights

1450
00:50:41,559 --> 00:50:45,440
is kind of where I like a fan yeah keep

1451
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:47,960
the air moving uh you don't want the air

1452
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:50,440
to get stale plants suck up the CO2 in

1453
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:52,240
the room quickly they can use the CO2

1454
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:53,960
around them super quickly and you just

1455
00:50:52,239 --> 00:50:57,479
got to move the air so there's more CO2

1456
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:58,798
for them to use up yeah we're 51 minutes

1457
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:00,599
in go ahead what are we going to say

1458
00:50:58,798 --> 00:51:02,759
would you throw uh maybe a box fan on

1459
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:06,079
the floor I do like a box fan on the

1460
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:07,520
floor super low speed um if you're on a

1461
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:09,280
budget the box fan is awesome if you

1462
00:51:07,519 --> 00:51:11,679
have more of a budget I would recommend

1463
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:13,359
a carbon filter with like a 6 in blower

1464
00:51:11,679 --> 00:51:15,159
on top of it just dead sitting in the

1465
00:51:13,358 --> 00:51:17,239
center of the room put some ducting off

1466
00:51:15,159 --> 00:51:19,039
the blower up to the ceiling and just

1467
00:51:17,239 --> 00:51:21,679
move that air from the floor back up to

1468
00:51:19,039 --> 00:51:23,279
the ceiling and you're picking up CO2

1469
00:51:21,679 --> 00:51:25,798
off the ground and putting it back up to

1470
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:27,720
fall back down onto your plants nice

1471
00:51:25,798 --> 00:51:29,318
yeah yeah and that's just differences in

1472
00:51:27,719 --> 00:51:31,879
budgets if you've got a low if you got

1473
00:51:29,318 --> 00:51:33,960
30 bucks buy a fan if you got 160 buy a

1474
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:35,838
blower and a filter yeah just kind of or

1475
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:38,480
I guess it's going to be closer to 260 I

1476
00:51:35,838 --> 00:51:40,599
guess that blower is going to be 120 130

1477
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:42,960
your filters are going to be got

1478
00:51:40,599 --> 00:51:45,680
expensive you know uh I've watched

1479
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:48,480
everything escalate in price uh since

1480
00:51:45,679 --> 00:51:50,480
I've been expanding my grows and since

1481
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:52,519
Colorado has been getting more popular

1482
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:54,639
everything has just gone up in price and

1483
00:51:52,519 --> 00:51:56,798
it's not even a competitive raise it's a

1484
00:51:54,639 --> 00:52:01,000
gouging raise and we I can see it they

1485
00:51:56,798 --> 00:52:03,000
know what we're doing I uh man remember

1486
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:05,199
buying a light in like

1487
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,838
2002 and keeping your head down at the

1488
00:52:05,199 --> 00:52:09,719
store trying not to be noticed man I

1489
00:52:06,838 --> 00:52:11,279
swear I paid like five 600 bucks for my

1490
00:52:09,719 --> 00:52:15,798
first light setup and it's just a

1491
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:19,720
magnetic uh 400 watt like nothing

1492
00:52:15,798 --> 00:52:21,798
special whatsoever so but everything

1493
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:25,159
else I feel like has got more expensive

1494
00:52:21,798 --> 00:52:27,000
yeah um lighting is the only only thing

1495
00:52:25,159 --> 00:52:29,199
and actually I guess it's just because

1496
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:31,079
there's so many newer options but basic

1497
00:52:29,199 --> 00:52:33,798
lighting I feel like's gotten

1498
00:52:31,079 --> 00:52:35,640
cheaper yeah and more reliable I

1499
00:52:33,798 --> 00:52:37,119
remember you would you'd buy [ __ ] and it

1500
00:52:35,639 --> 00:52:38,879
would just die on you and now stuff

1501
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:41,680
seems to last at least a year or two and

1502
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:43,519
if if it doesn't you can take it back

1503
00:52:41,679 --> 00:52:45,118
all right we've gone 52 minutes my next

1504
00:52:43,519 --> 00:52:47,039

vegetarian in 2002 for sure um I can't

1577

00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:29,679
but there was an event that happened and

1579
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:30,720
one of my friends I hadn't seen in a

1580
00:55:29,679 --> 00:55:32,558
while made fun of me for being a

1581
00:55:30,719 --> 00:55:34,879
vegetarian at bonaroo and I remember the

1582
