great cross it says it came with a free

77
00:03:01,259 --> 00:03:06,179
five pack of Tangy Ripper that is also a

78
00:03:04,259 --> 00:03:08,098
great cross the Tangy Ripper is of

79
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:10,500
course Platinum Tangy the Platinum Tangy

80
00:03:08,098 --> 00:03:13,018
female cross to a Jack the Ripper male

81
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:15,719
it makes a super orange candy flavored

82
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:18,300
buds a Big Pine Cone big donkey dick

83
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:20,759
buds that have some orange flavor with

84
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:22,980
like a lemon lime background sort of

85
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:25,739
that terpenoline dryer sheet hint to it

86
00:03:22,979 --> 00:03:27,899
really uh really zesty flavored but

87
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:30,420
really nice head Buzz real social weed

88
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:33,239
real easy to grow flowers in my opinion

89
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:34,919
let me stay focused it says uh these

90
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:37,378
plants are in week six and it seems as

91
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:38,818
if they may finish super late all right

92
00:03:37,378 --> 00:03:41,158
so you're in week six and it's looking

93
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:43,259
like they may finish super late uh most

94
00:03:41,158 --> 00:03:46,079
of those plants do go about nine maybe

95
00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:47,878
ten weeks maybe 72 days so you got a

96
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,440
ways to go I'm not sure what you

97
00:03:47,878 --> 00:03:51,120
consider super late some of my stuff

98
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:53,519
some of the plants I grow for myself go

99
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,080
14 weeks so I'm not sure what some

100
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,480
people consider super late but you're

101
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:59,040
correct they may take you 72 days now

102
00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:02,158
here's where it gets interesting and fun

103
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:03,780
here's where our question arises it says

104
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:06,120
since you are the creator of this

105
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:08,340
cultivar when do you think I should

106
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:11,219
start flushing these plants I don't want

107
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:14,400
to flush too early please give me some

108
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:15,840
tips so I can be successful now this is

109
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,120
the part of the podcast where things are

110
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,340
going to get very interesting a long

111
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,500
time ago I did a full episode about

112
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:24,359
flushing our plants I preached it we

113
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,339
should let me talk about what I mean by

114
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,319
flushing let's start there what I'm

115
00:04:26,339 --> 00:04:30,000
referring to at this point in this this

116
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:32,300
episode throughout this episode when I

117
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,819
say flushing right now I'm talking about

118
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:38,699
usually uh 10 to 14 days before Harvest

119
00:04:35,819 --> 00:04:41,339
I would preach to water our plants with

120
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:43,020
just water with no nutrients in an

121
00:04:41,339 --> 00:04:44,698
attempt to clean out whatever the plants

122
00:04:43,019 --> 00:04:46,740
are in if it's cocoa if it's soil

123
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:48,060
soilless mix let's get rid of the

124
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:50,340
excessive nutrients if we've been

125
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:52,319
feeding bottled nutrients let's wash all

126
00:04:50,339 --> 00:04:54,779
that out of there so that the plant will

127
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:57,000
then begin to cannibalize and starve

128
00:04:54,779 --> 00:04:58,679
itself so that there are no nutrients

129
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,740
left in that plant so that when we cut

130
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:03,600
it down we don't taste nutrients in that

131
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:05,100
plant that's what I used to preach it's

132
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,139
what a lot of Growers used to preach

133
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:09,060
that has been the idea the philosophy

134
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:11,579
the school of thought for many many

135
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:15,060
years now at this point in time I'm not

136
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:17,879
sure that if I agree or believe in the

137
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:19,259
idea of flushing our plants I've got

138
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:21,300
some notes Here I want to try to stick

139
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:23,400
to them of course I'm going to wave

140
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:25,978
freestyle off of that but let me start

141
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:29,159
now the notes say I'm still studying to

142
00:05:25,978 --> 00:05:30,959
determine if flushing is real I'm not

143
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:33,180
even sure if I believe that that's real

144
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:34,620
my notes say you can flush the medium

145
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:37,139
you can starve the plant and it will

146
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:39,660
cannibalize itself but here's the

147
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:41,819
question what are you flushing out I

148
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:43,380
don't have the scientific or organic

149
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:46,439
chemistry background to really explain

150
00:05:43,379 --> 00:05:48,839
this in a scientific way but hear me out

151
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:51,719
go on this journey with me let's just

152
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:53,819
say that you are going to eat me okay

153
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,199
nobody wants to eat me but just come

154
00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:57,300
along with me for the ride I'm gonna

155
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,580
taste terrible we already know that but

156
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:01,680
let's just say you were gonna eat me if

157
00:05:59,579 --> 00:06:03,779
you ate me right now do you think I

158
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,939
would taste any differently if you

159
00:06:03,779 --> 00:06:07,559
poured if you made me drink 100 gallons

160
00:06:05,939 --> 00:06:10,319
of water and piss a lot for a couple of

161
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:13,500
days and then eat me am I going to taste

162
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:15,240
any differently I don't think so because

163
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:17,279
all of the stuff that I've eaten over

164
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,900
the past however many years I've been

165
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:21,839
alive however many days however many

166
00:06:18,899 --> 00:06:25,318
meals I've had that has created me that

167
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:28,258
has become skin blood teeth hair

168
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:30,300
eyeballs uh fat that I've burned off

169
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:33,479
which the plant is creating using energy

170
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:35,460
as well I've used that to it's the stuff

171
00:06:33,478 --> 00:06:37,740
that I ate are the building blocks that

172
00:06:35,459 --> 00:06:39,538
made me who I am and not who I am but

173
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:41,579
what I physically am it created my

174
00:06:39,538 --> 00:06:43,199
physical being the minimal amount of

175
00:06:41,579 --> 00:06:45,359
muscle that is here that came from the

176
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,280
things that I ate my skeletal structure

177
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,379
my blood everything that's all in here

178
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:51,659
this bag of meat that I am as a human

179
00:06:49,379 --> 00:06:53,759
that's all from the food and the

180
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:55,139
nutrients that I have consumed it's all

181
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,939
here it's on me I got a little extra

182
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:58,379
right now uh because it was a good

183
00:06:56,939 --> 00:07:00,779
winter I ate a whole lot for the winter

184
00:06:58,379 --> 00:07:02,879
I'm burning that off in the summer but

185
00:07:00,779 --> 00:07:05,459
my comparison is what are we flushing

186
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:07,500
out of these plants the stuff that we

187
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:10,079
the nitrogen phosphorus potassium

188
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:11,519
molybdenum so sulfur everything that

189
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:13,800
we've put into these plants the 16

190
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:16,918
Elements which they have absorbed have

191
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:18,780
turned into plant it is now a stem it is

192
00:07:16,918 --> 00:07:21,839
now a vascular system within the plant

193
00:07:18,779 --> 00:07:24,418
it is now branches it is leaves it is

194
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:26,579
buds it is chlorophyll it is trichomes

195
00:07:24,418 --> 00:07:28,439
it has become all of these other things

196
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:31,439
it has become it has been metabolized

197
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:33,660
into plant so I'm not sure what we

198
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:35,339
really what I even thought we were

199
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,900
flushing out of that plant so I know

200
00:07:35,339 --> 00:07:39,000
that this could become a controversial

201
00:07:36,899 --> 00:07:41,098
episode this could be a topic that stirs

202
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,538
up a lot of controversy by the way get

203
00:07:41,098 --> 00:07:44,699
the comments going down there in the

204
00:07:42,538 --> 00:07:46,318
comment section please do type a long

205
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:48,720
paragraph and let me know what you think

206
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:50,220
about this am I crazy am I correct do

207
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,780
you have any real science do you have

208
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:54,060
some Bro Science do you have any

209
00:07:51,779 --> 00:07:55,679
thoughts inputs information Corrections

210
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:57,360
comments concerns throw those right down

211
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,579
there down there in the YouTube comments

212
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,680
let's see what you guys think but I'm

213
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:04,198
really I don't know what we could

214
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,300
possibly be flushing out the plant takes

215
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:08,699
up food it turns it into buds it turns

216
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:09,900
it into leaves chlorophyll it turns it

217
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:11,939
into all all of the things that are

218
00:08:09,899 --> 00:08:13,739
required to be a happy living plant it

219
00:08:11,939 --> 00:08:15,360
creates exudates those exudates come out

220
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:18,598
in the soil the microbes interact with

221
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,280
those repeat process basically in a much

222
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:22,378
much more fancier form that was the

223
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:24,839
crude version but I don't know what we

224
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:27,360
could possibly be flushing out it's not

225
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:29,399
like the nutrients the the Cal Mag the

226
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,199
nitrogen bottle the phosphorus bottle

227
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:33,360
the bloom booster bottle that we fed the

228
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,979
plant it's not like we poured those into

229
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,379
a can and they're still just existing

230
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:39,300
they're Loose as bottled nutrients or

231
00:08:37,379 --> 00:08:41,099
even maybe into a little baggie and we

232
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:43,019
got nitrogen and phosphorus molecules

233
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:44,459
just hanging out in the bag I don't

234
00:08:43,019 --> 00:08:46,679
think that's the way that it works I

235
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:49,079
think all of that stuff has been however

236
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:51,000
you want to put it science terms uh Bro

237
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:54,300
Science terms it's been turned into

238
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:57,120
digested processed metabolized and it is

239
00:08:54,299 --> 00:08:58,979
now plant it's not stuff you can flush

240
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,799
out I don't really think we can flush

241
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:03,180
out the nutrients and the things of the

242
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:04,979
plant you'd have to it's not like a

243
00:09:03,179 --> 00:09:06,539
sponge we can't just rinse it out you

244
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:08,899
can't just clean it out I don't think it

245
00:09:06,539 --> 00:09:11,039
works that way so maybe that's a comfort

246
00:09:08,899 --> 00:09:13,620
controversial ramble maybe that's a

247
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:16,679
controversial idea but I don't know that

248
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:18,000
flushing really does anything so if you

249
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:19,319
don't believe me if you want to argue

250
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,120
with me if you want to back me up

251
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,800
support me I appreciate either one of

252
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,019
those I love free thinking human beings

253
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:28,079
that's a beautiful thing but I challenge

254
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:30,720
you in your garden grow two plants the

255
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,820
same the same everything the same clone

256
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,459
don't do it from seed get a clone have

257
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:37,980
two clones put them in the same type of

258
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:39,659
soil put them

259
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:41,459
um not in the middle of the light but

260
00:09:39,659 --> 00:09:42,899
off center of the light both of them one

261
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:44,819
to the left one to the right to where

262
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:47,899
they're getting basically equal amount

263
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:50,640
of light feed them the exact same thing

264
00:09:47,899 --> 00:09:52,440
lollipop then pop and twist them any way

265
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:54,360
that you normally would do the exact

266
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:56,100
same thing to both of these plants treat

267
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:58,500
them like they are twin brother twin

268
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:00,000
sisters love them both exactly the same

269
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:02,399
then here's where we're going to get

270
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,200
scientific let's do this extreme so that

271
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,480
we really see a difference in case there

272
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:09,420
is a difference let's make sure we don't

273
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,879
miss it let's flush one plant for 4 14

274
00:10:09,419 --> 00:10:15,059
solid days let's excessively flush it

275
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:16,320
maybe in most cases I consider a flush a

276
00:10:15,059 --> 00:10:18,719
lot of you have the wrong idea on how to

277
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,220
flush also let me touch on that a lot of

278
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,500
people think that a flush is by

279
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:24,360
completely over watering that plant

280
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,799
until all kinds of water is falling out

281
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,959
of the bottom and he got a big mess of

282
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:29,579
just runny drippy plant with mud coming

283
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:31,919
out of the bottom that is not a flush

284
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:33,300
that's an over water you can do that if

285
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:36,059
that's what you want to do but that's an

286
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:37,979
over water in my opinion an end of

287
00:10:36,059 --> 00:10:40,379
harvest or an end to flowering flush a

288
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:42,539
pre-harvest flush is just water it until

289
00:10:40,379 --> 00:10:44,759
you get somewhere between 10 and 30

290
00:10:42,539 --> 00:10:46,679
percent runoff if you can pour in a

291
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:48,838
gallon of water and get a quarter gallon

292
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:50,159
of runoff out of your pot that would be

293
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:52,560
perfect that would be beautiful that's

294
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:53,879
an easy amount of water to dispose of to

295
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:55,859
manage it's not going to be a big deal

296
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:57,539
you don't need to go running 10 gallons

297
00:10:55,860 --> 00:11:00,180
of water through a three gallon pot at

298
00:10:57,539 --> 00:11:01,679
one time what you want to do is water it

299
00:11:00,179 --> 00:11:03,838
till you get run off so you know you've

300
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:05,699
cleaned out that soil then let it dry

301
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:08,459
like you normally would however long it

302
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:11,100
normally takes then repeat that process

303
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:13,319
as May many times as possible over a

304
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:15,420
14-day process if you do flush that's

305
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,980
the way to do it if you do choose to

306
00:11:15,419 --> 00:11:19,500
flush that's the way that I recommend to

307
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:22,320
do it so take one plant give it that 14

308
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:24,120
day flush process with just water you

309
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,560
can pH that water if you want don't pH

310
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,480
it if you don't want to that part

311
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:30,299
doesn't matter to me I've got a whole

312
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:31,800
other school of thought on that we pH so

313
00:11:30,299 --> 00:11:33,299
that the plants will take up nutrients

314
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:35,039
we don't want them to take up nutrients

315
00:11:33,299 --> 00:11:36,419
right if you don't pH it it's not going

316
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:38,819
to take up nutrients why bother

317
00:11:36,419 --> 00:11:40,620
adjusting the pH at this time that is my

318
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:42,180
theory there they're going to get the

319
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:45,600
water that they need they won't get more

320
00:11:42,179 --> 00:11:47,879
food if you are a flush person so do the

321
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,800
flush phase to one plant and don't flush

322
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:51,539
the other one mark them if you're going

323
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:53,879
to flush one and not flush the other one

324
00:11:51,539 --> 00:11:55,319
put a little sticker or a little tag or

325
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:57,120
something on the one you are flushing

326
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:59,579
and the one you're not so that you don't

327
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,078
mix that up so once we've completed the

328
00:11:59,578 --> 00:12:03,419
flowering phase and we have done this

329
00:12:01,078 --> 00:12:05,699
flushing process on one and we have not

330
00:12:03,419 --> 00:12:08,099
flushed the other what really matters to

331
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:10,140
me the most in my opinion this is my

332
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:11,759
personal opinion in I've grown a lot of

333
00:12:10,139 --> 00:12:13,078
weed i've smoked a lot of weed I've been

334
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:15,899
around a little bit I've been in big

335
00:12:13,078 --> 00:12:17,099
rooms little rooms I participated in a

336
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:19,740
lot of cultivating and a lot of

337
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:21,899
cultivation allegedly

338
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:24,180
um I think that drying and curing is

339
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:26,039
more important than flushing the drying

340
00:12:24,179 --> 00:12:27,719
and curing phase is where we get rid of

341
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:29,278
that chlorophyll that's where the

342
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:31,800
chlorophyll gets removed from the

343
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:33,778
flowers and the dry and cure process oh

344
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:35,219
we seal it up the anaerobes begin to eat

345
00:12:33,778 --> 00:12:37,620
the chlorophyll we open it up the

346
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:40,019
chlorophyll gas is released once again

347
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:43,740
that's the crude version but that drying

348
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:46,500
and curing process in my opinion is more

349
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:49,860
important than the flushing process you

350
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:51,600
can fix or completely ruin flowers in

351
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:54,000
the dry and cure process you can take a

352
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,740
crop that was grown okay and you can

353
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,778
make it pretty good by drying it

354
00:12:55,740 --> 00:13:00,060
properly you can also take a crop that

355
00:12:57,778 --> 00:13:02,458
was grown superbly perfectly beautifully

356
00:13:00,059 --> 00:13:04,379
every attention paid to every detail all

357
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:06,599
the way up until Harvest and you can

358
00:13:04,379 --> 00:13:08,639
ruin that [ __ ] in the first four to six

359
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:10,560
hours of the dry and cure process or

360
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:13,200
within the first week of the dry and

361
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:15,539
cure process drying and curing is super

362
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:18,778
important in my opinion more important

363
00:13:15,539 --> 00:13:21,059
more so than the flushing phase so I'm

364
00:13:18,778 --> 00:13:23,700
still curious I'm still skeptical if

365
00:13:21,059 --> 00:13:25,799
flushing is even necessary is Flushing

366
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:28,500
real as flushing a myth is Flushing Bro

367
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:30,120
Science at this point I kind of want to

368
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:32,100
think that it's Bro Science I don't see

369
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:34,320
anything that supports it so with all of

370
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:36,659
that being said if you do choose to

371
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:39,420
flush your plants that does happen in

372
00:13:36,659 --> 00:13:41,819
the final 10 to 14 days of your

373
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:44,879
flowering phase if you have a package of

374
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:48,240
your seed says to go 77 days start that

375
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:50,700
14 days before the 77th day let that

376
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,860
77th day finish then tomorrow go in

377
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:54,060
there and chop those plants down now I

378
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:55,620
do know that I said a lot of

379
