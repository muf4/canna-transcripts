[ __ ] stick my iPhone in my head and I

89
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:19,719
can just think like text Adam and tell

90
00:03:17,878 --> 00:03:21,079
him to come over and take dabs with me

91
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:22,479
that would be funny yeah we're recording

92
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,080
now just so that you guys are aware your

93
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:25,158
next thought would be a little weird hey

94
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,519
what's up guys thanks for joining us

95
00:03:25,158 --> 00:03:27,878
we're just here having a little random

96
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:29,400
conversation uh we're going to have a

97
00:03:27,878 --> 00:03:31,759
grow lesson we got Jesse back as

98
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:34,438
promised hey what's up thanks for coming

99
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:35,479
bro also uh Adam's back Adam's uh he's

100
00:03:34,438 --> 00:03:37,438
on the show all the time but you guys

101
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:38,679
might not know that Adam's a new grower

102
00:03:37,438 --> 00:03:41,079
he's kind of new to Colorado it's his

103
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:43,760
first grow season here and he does have

104
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:45,439
some outdoor plants so uh I invited him

105
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:47,000
to stick around while Jesse's here he

106
00:03:45,438 --> 00:03:48,239
may have some good outdoor questions he

107
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,199
may bring up some [ __ ] that we may

108
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,400
Overlook so it's always good uh to have

109
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:54,679
a new guy in to kind of referee us

110
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,239
because been told we're kind of snobs

111
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:58,519
and we go a little fast and we talk

112
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,280
about [ __ ] like everybody should know so

113
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:01,920
we'll slow down we'll try to go for you

114
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,759
guys and keep it at a pace where you can

115
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:05,878
keep up but I do plan to uh increase the

116
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:08,000
knowledge in this show slowly but surely

117
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:10,280
over time so that you guys can all

118
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,239
improve take your grow to the next level

119
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:14,598
that's right knowledge is power that

120
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,920
came from Adam yeah never stop learning

121
00:04:14,598 --> 00:04:18,959
that might be the smartest thing Adam's

122
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:20,159
going to say all day that's it you guys

123
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,280
said I was too loud in the headphones I

124
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,120
got to turn that [ __ ] up now you guys

125
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:25,000
are crazy no you were too loud in my

126
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,240
headphones all right so uh of course

127
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,120
we're back for an outdoor grow lesson

128
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,720
it's full bloom time your plants should

129
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:32,600
be starting to flower you guys rock and

130
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,680
rolling rocking and rolling all right

131

132
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,759
you guys have pulled your Maes it's time

133
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:40,799
to pull the Maes now right yeah uh it's

134
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:42,720
past time way way past time if you

135
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,000
haven't pulled your mails you've got a

136
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,280
seated crop and your neighbors have a

137
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,639
seated crop and someone else on the

138
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:49,519
block has a seated crop and they're all

139
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,680
pissed off at you so you [ __ ] up but

140
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:52,038
hopefully you pulled your mails by now

141
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:55,759
cuz you're in full bloom so that means

142
00:04:52,038 --> 00:04:58,120
we're probably 25 30 days in

143
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:00,240
um he's pulling out a calendar is why we

144
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:02,439
have a little bit of Silence yeah sure

145
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,879
for some strains for some strains okay

146
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:06,199
Adam was saying he had one that took a

147
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:07,719
long time to switch into flower um it's

148
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:10,000
just now getting to the point where it's

149
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,919
like visibly flour it probably it

150
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,839
probably switched last week or so

151
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:16,240
officially you know but um it had it had

152
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:19,119
definitely taken it might be a little

153
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,160
bit longer but it it the other two had

154
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,759
switched into flower 3 or 4 weeks ago

155
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:28,039

156

be done all right yeah cool um 70 days

201
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:10,840
from so today is actually Thursday this

202
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:13,239
show won't go up until Monday morning so

203
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:14,478
you're going to have closer to 65 but

204
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:17,800
and you probably won't listen till

205
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:19,318
Wednesday so for sure you're get getting

206
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,720
down nine weeks you got about nine weeks

207
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:22,960
to flower guys nine or 10 weeks

208
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,440
depending on where you are if you're in

209
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:26,159
California you could get that [ __ ] out

210
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:27,719
no problem but if you're in Colorado you

211
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,520
got about nine weeks if you're higher up

212
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:32,879
if you're towards Denver you may want

213
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:35,240
want to cut that a little closer to

214
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:37,560
Thanksgiving people uh folks in

215
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:39,720
California have been uh flowering longer

216
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:41,038
than us it seems like a lot of them you

217
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,560
know from the pictures I've seen they

218
00:07:41,038 --> 00:07:44,878
definitely went into flowers sooner

219
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,800
that's I I can imagine several things

220
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,360
that why that would be but I wonder what

221
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,360
the actual reason is do you think

222
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:54,080
they've selected uh better

223
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:57,919
strains um no Auto

224
00:07:54,079 --> 00:08:01,399
flowers okay send all hate mail

225
00:07:57,918 --> 00:08:04,240
to uh

226
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:07,598
I don't know I wonder if uh the coast

227
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:10,158
maybe like just their different region

228
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:12,918
they're at a different uh latitude and

229
00:08:10,158 --> 00:08:14,360
longitude in the earth uh North and

230
00:08:12,918 --> 00:08:16,198
South makes a huge difference yeah they

231
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,759
they get the sun you know a slightly

232
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:19,960
different angle or something like that

233
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:21,598
you know guys if somebody understands

234
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:22,878
why those plants in Cali flowered sooner

235
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:25,120
I think we just nailed it but if you got

236
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,879
the if you got the sciency reason tweet

237
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,840
that to me email it to me AGR culture

238
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,158
hotmail.com AGR culture on Twitter let

239
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:33,000
me know we'd like to understand more of

240
00:08:30,158 --> 00:08:34,639
that agriculture on Facebook uh we get

241
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,278
it but we want you to explain it because

242
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:39,199
we're podcast host and Stoners and uh

243
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:42,399
that's [ __ ] you can explain it we'd

244
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,879
like to understand yeah yeah so I asked

245
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,039
Jesse at the when he got here we took a

246
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:47,600
bunch of dabs of course and then we

247
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:49,240
talked about we wanted to do uh he

248
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,360
talked about top dressing a little bit

249
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:53,600
do you want to talk about the mulching

250
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:55,360
and the top dressing yeah for sure um

251
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,759
you know I I think it's safe to say to

252
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,480
go ahead and uh switch over all your uh

253
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:01,278
top dressings and your te's and stuff

254
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:05,519
stuff to you know throw in that that

255
00:09:01,278 --> 00:09:10,000
high PE stuff uh High PK um you know

256
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:12,360
pretty much chill out on the nitrogen um

257
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,759
Adam's got some plants that are nitrogen

258
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:18,839
deficient visibly on the lower lower

259
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:19,958
bottom lower third of the plant uhhuh I

260
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:22,920
told him to hit it real good with

261
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:24,679
nitrogen one more time real hard for his

262
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:25,799
feeding you think yeah okay all right

263
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:28,078
I'm going to show this mic a little more

264
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:29,639
to your face sorry sorry sorry guys

265
00:09:28,078 --> 00:09:31,799

00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:34,360
World he'll be a lot more audible now I

267
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:36,199
just noticed that um oh yeah look at

268
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,959
that we can hear him yeah sorry no

269

00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:43,360
comfortable way more fluid on the show

272
00:09:41,078 --> 00:09:45,078
now compared to the first episode nice

273
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,879
uh I think you were on number eight or

274
00:09:45,078 --> 00:09:49,479
six it was number eight and we're at 26

275
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:52,078
now bro so you've been coming quite a

276
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:54,639
few times nice yeah all right keep going

277
00:09:52,078 --> 00:09:58,159
sorry I totally interrupted you maybe uh

278
00:09:54,639 --> 00:10:00,159
give like a little foler feed uh locally

279
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:02,360
just to that part of the plant a high

280
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:04,600
nitrogen um you

281
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:07,720
know uh several different ways you could

282
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:11,759
do that my option is basically to put

283
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:15,200
grow in a bottle and spray it for sure

284
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:16,480
yeah really really D yeah yeah for sure

285
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,680
that that would work perfect if anything

286
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,879
that's my problem is I'm a little

287
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:23,439
underfeeding you know what I'm saying I

288
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:25,480
mean you gave me the chart and I've just

289
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,120
been basically going off of that besides

290
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:29,120
all the additives that I should have

291
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,639
gotten probably by now that I don't have

292
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,278
yes I told Adam to buy a couple of

293
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:35,559
things um and I didn't get them so well

294
00:10:33,278 --> 00:10:36,679
now you can see it oh yeah yeah well now

295
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:38,119
that's that's understandable you're a

296
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:39,879
new grower you don't have a budget to

297
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:42,200
allocate to Growing you got a family you

298
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:44,919
got a life learn new to chemicals learn

299
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:46,480
to take uh nutrients not we I just want

300
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:48,399
to avoid the word chemicals I mean to be

301
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,120
so but yeah chemicals is a scary word

302
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,078
nutrients is a I steered clear of

303
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:54,799
Miracle glow grow on the East Coast

304
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:57,359
because but try to when you harvest this

305
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:59,519
try to either if you have a patient

306
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,800
friend that needs some medicine or I

307
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,120
don't know the [ __ ] straight way to

308
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:03,199
do that but save the money that you

309
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,039
normally would have gone to your

310
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,200
caregiver or your dispensary save that

311
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:08,120
money next year because you're going to

312
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:10,720
have your own pot you're growing it and

313
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:12,039
buy those bottles that you could not get

314
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,759
this year you know what I mean make your

315
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:15,278
[ __ ] a little bit better next year and

316
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:17,200
then the next year a little bit better

317
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:18,559
and then every then by the time you're

318
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,639
just an amateur grower you don't need

319
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:22,000
the [ __ ] Rockstar drum set yet by the

320
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:23,320
time you're a good Rockstar you'll have

321
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,600
a rockstar setup you'll know what you're

322
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:26,680
doing and it's easier to learn I think

323
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,240
you learn better I became a good grower

324
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:29,838
cuz I started with struggle bud you know

325
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,200
I started with a shitty

326
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,399
like this sucks and then had to grow a

327
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,839
whole crop through that cuz you don't

328
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:36,639
want to rebuild your room in the middle

329
00:11:34,839 --> 00:11:38,320
of a grow and then bought the next

330
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:40,079
upgrade and then realized that I've

331
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:43,000
never had a room I've always had like a

332
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:44,838
small box with plants in it and then now

333
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,879
it's outdoors so you were never in a

334
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:47,959
state where you could just go to the

335
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:50,200
grow shop and be like I need this yeah

336
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:52,518
we could walk in we it almost feels like

337
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:54,200
we're cheating it's almost too easy it

338
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:56,360
is cheating at this point it's almost

339
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:58,120
too easy all right let's go back to top

340
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:00,159
dressing with mulch you should be

341
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:02,000
hooking them up with your full bloom

342
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:04,000
feed like you was saying pull back on

343
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,799
the nitrogen get your phosphorus and

344
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,600
potassium in there heavily for sure um

345
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:11,278
so you're mulching you're uh explain

346
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,560
that to the guys that like [ __ ] I'll

347
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:13,838
tell you I'm [ __ ] on mulching I know

348
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:15,679
how to mulch my yard and my trees

349
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:18,560
outside what are we using for mulch for

350
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:21,519
our weed plants um I've been using uh

351
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:25,838
fresh green matter um most of it's from

352
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:28,879
the plant itself the the leaves um and

353
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:31,079
weed seedlings I've been pulling up um

354
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:32,480
and then and also I've been well I've

355
00:12:31,078 --> 00:12:36,278
been mixing that with

356
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:39,000
straw um that's been composted um and

357
00:12:36,278 --> 00:12:41,919
I'm you know I'm building a a mulch

358
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:45,720
Mound around the plants that's probably

359
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:50,039
8 10 in tall um and the circumference of

360
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:51,759
the uh um yeah yeah I'm picturing a

361
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:53,639
coffee can is kind of what I see coffee

362
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:56,600
can sh well I mean it's a it's a

363
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:58,959
freaking mound man you know I mean yeah

364
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:01,320
know it's pretty you know maybe closer

365
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:03,278
to 10 or 12 in in the center and then

366
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:06,560
we're we're coming out probably 2T in

367
00:13:03,278 --> 00:13:10,078
circumference so wow but um when I've

368
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:13,039
removed part of the to apply top

369
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:17,599
dressing um the root growth that I've

370
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:20,679
seen um is just phenomenal um the soil

371
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,399
just looks better it looks happier um

372
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:23,559
it's not as tight as it normally gets

373
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:26,839
when it's getting

374
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:28,638
sunbaked um and you know I've always

375
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:31,320
topped or mulched a little bit but never

376
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:33,240
to this EX extent I'm just uh so in

377
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:35,440
nature wouldn't leaves fall off of a

378
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,879
plant and kind of decompose where the

379
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,240
plant's growing and provide that

380
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:40,240
nutrient for next year so that makes a

381
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,759
lot of great sense here here's my

382
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:45,799
question do you ever worry about heat

383
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:50,198
with that no um I I mean I did initially

384
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:52,120
cuz I mean I know how works yeah yeah um

385
00:13:50,198 --> 00:13:55,078
but uh that's why I've always kind of

386
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:59,480
steered away from it um but doing the

387
00:13:55,078 --> 00:14:01,519
big Mound with you know um if just this

388
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:03,519
work great you know it'll be dry on top

389
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:06,039
but as I work down into it I've looked

390
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:08,639
for something to keep the heat off my

391
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:10,919
soil because my soil is just baked and I

392
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,600
tried sand because somebody was like

393
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:14,879
I'll just put a layer of sand on there

394
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:17,519
and I went out there and my plants were

395
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:20,958
like sand choked him out good don't

396
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:22,240
don't use sand yeah yeah I've heard say

397
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:24,319
you can get rid of your dirt bugs with

398
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:27,759
sand if you do it use a really tiny tiny

399
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:29,759
layer just just make some diation into

400
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:32,959
your feet re apply it every single time

401
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:34,519
after you uh water it's a gigantic it

402
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:35,799
looks like uh we've kind of worked over

403
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:38,039

matter I can definitely work with you

451
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:24,799
know like I'd be a little nervous about

452
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,039
that personally um so don't just grab

453
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:29,758
any weeds and start mulching it yeah

454
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:32,198
yeah like um I'm you

455
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:35,159
know select about mine my weeds are

456
00:16:32,198 --> 00:16:36,559
actually morning glory seeds so and if

457
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:39,318
anyone knows anything about Morning

458
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:42,758
Glory highly highly

459
00:16:39,318 --> 00:16:44,919
invasive so it's easy to find but so how

460
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:46,680
much water sorry how big are your plants

461
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:48,198
Outdoors can I even ask should I I can

462
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:49,719
avoid questions you don't want to answer

463
00:16:48,198 --> 00:16:54,599
we're doing like

464
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:59,720
uh uh 6 to8 foot um each one's probably

465
00:16:54,600 --> 00:17:01,399
minimum 4ot in circumference so um there

466
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:03,240
that take three of us to put our arms

467
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:05,959
together to get around it probably yeah

468
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:07,400
this stocks as big as that water bottle

469
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:10,318
yeah I've seen pictures the stocks are

470
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:11,919
as big as my forearm yeah coming out of

471
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:14,119
one of them is actually it's pretty

472
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:16,600
gnarly moved from Plants to shrubs how

473
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:19,639
much uh how much water does a plant that

474
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:22,558
size take every day 7 and 1 half to 10

475
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:24,480
gallons a day wow times however many

476
00:17:22,558 --> 00:17:28,558
plants he's got we won't even go there

477
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:30,000
so dechlorinated filtered arated exactly

478
00:17:28,558 --> 00:17:32,119
what I headed to it's got to be hauled

479
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,079
in somewhere if you're out in a uh rural

480
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:35,239
area because there's not enough water to

481
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:36,639
do that if you're just coming out of

482
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:38,599
your well sometimes you don't want to

483
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,440
drain the well you got to have water for

484
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:42,000
your life piss your neighbors off real

485
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:44,679
good

486
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,759
too I didn't even think of that [ __ ] oh

487
00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:50,360
man and then the federal government

488
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:52,119
regulates most well so yeah they can't

489
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:54,599
know that their real understanding of

490
00:17:52,119 --> 00:17:58,798
pot grows as I understand it so they're

491
00:17:54,599 --> 00:17:58,798
real inviting for that sort of thing

492
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,679
all right so we've covered a lot about

493
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,440
water oh man there was a hum and I just

494
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,798
found it there was a squeal in my

495
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,919
headphones I hope it only happen in my

496
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:09,440
ears but it went just a minute ago and I

497
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:11,280
was my headphone could have been my head

498
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,960
all right so yeah that's something we

499
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:14,558
talked about a few episodes ago uh the

500
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,360
federal government is Banning [ __ ]

501
00:18:14,558 --> 00:18:18,440
water use for dispensaries and grows

502
00:18:16,359 --> 00:18:20,599
which uh if they catch if a federal

503
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:22,038
agent federal agent if somebody for like

504
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:24,319
the department of Waterworks or somebody

505
00:18:22,038 --> 00:18:26,558
something that works in a federal agency

506
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:28,240
discovers water in their municipality

507
00:18:26,558 --> 00:18:29,960
being used for a cannabis grow they're

508
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,079
supposed to pours the cannabis grow in

509
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:33,759
the water that's something we talked

510
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:36,558
about a few episodes ago whack [ __ ] be

511
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:39,960
careful you guys be super careful uh try

512
00:18:36,558 --> 00:18:41,960
to be super discreet all right um we

513
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:43,919
talked a little bit about worms you were

514
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:46,840
saying that the worms were crawling up

515
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:49,400
into your mulch yeah yeah that's crazy

516
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:51,079
that means happy mulch yeah uh the worms

517
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:53,240
get up there they're probably eating

518
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:55,158
those leaves yeah for they're probably

519
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:58,240
secreting their enzymes all over those

520
00:18:55,159 --> 00:19:00,520
leaves uh those leaves are breaking down

521
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,640
and becom nutrients uh that are more

522
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:05,119
bioavailable to the plants so that's a

523
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,960
win-win situation for everybody yeah do

524
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:09,519

525

551
00:20:02,679 --> 00:20:06,200

552
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,440
and I say this thing broke again and

553
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:10,319
they just give me another one of the

554
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:12,320
same thing so it just cost me a trip to

555
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:13,319
Guitar Center every few weeks which you

556
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:15,639
know they're cool over there and I

557
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:17,439
always find new toys so what the hell

558
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:19,520
let's do it hopefully the company goes

559
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,798
out of business then you get an upgrade

560
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:24,519
there you go if I recall now you're

561
00:20:21,798 --> 00:20:27,000
thinking store credit on an upgrade or

562
00:20:24,519 --> 00:20:28,240
something yeah that's just random talk

563
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,159
guys I hope you enjoy hearing us talk

564
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,440
about Rand [ __ ] I get messages that are

565
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:33,080
like just hang out and talk we love

566
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,519
hearing you talk so that was some of

567
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:35,879
that you probably want to hear me talk

568
00:20:34,519 --> 00:20:38,519
about weed and not my piece of [ __ ]

569
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:40,360
equipment but that's all right uh so

570
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:41,839
worms yeah worms are awesome put worms

571
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:43,719
by uh the roots of your plants all the

572
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:46,158
time that's good stuff

573
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:50,079
yeah hey and if you find a worm don't

574
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:52,080
bury it that not how that works okay let

575
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:54,158
me re explain that and not stone or talk

576
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:58,639
it if you find a worm and you want to

577
00:20:54,159 --> 00:21:01,400
put it into your plant um don't bury it

578
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:04,600
gently put him on the surface let him

579
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:06,038
work him his way down or it's way in

580
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:08,240
there so I'm sure yours are in the

581
00:21:06,038 --> 00:21:09,679
ground so finding worms in your plants

582
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,880
are one thing but should I go out and

583
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:14,120
get some worms would that be beneficial

584
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:16,799
at the beginning of you know when I

585
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:18,639
first put the plants out there I I don't

586
00:21:16,798 --> 00:21:20,558
think it would hurt okay it wouldn't

587
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,320
hurt that's uh you're feeding bottled

588
00:21:20,558 --> 00:21:23,440
nutrients there's a lot of acids and

589
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:25,879
salts and what you're feeding they're

590
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:29,480
going to wreak havoc on your I've

591
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:32,919
inadvertently had uh worms in in indoor

592
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:34,360
plants before but never purposely so um

593
00:21:32,919 --> 00:21:36,080
how about growing mushrooms in your soil

594
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:38,119
on accident those yellow mushrooms that

595
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:40,439
pop up I see a lot of that in Colorado

596
00:21:38,119 --> 00:21:43,519
because of the weird climate changes

597
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:45,440
yeah I got some uh crazy gr gashi

598
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:48,558

649
00:23:42,038 --> 00:23:47,960
third cup a third of a cup of groc Kashi

650
00:23:44,679 --> 00:23:50,200
mix that [ __ ] in there threw it away

651
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:53,038
uh six days later I mean I can visually

652
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:56,600
see stuff turning into humate you know

653
00:23:53,038 --> 00:23:59,679
wow yeah it's white Web of Life in there

654

oh big time oh big time okay

655
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:04,320
can you send one to my phone and then

656
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,960
let me tweet that from the show stuff

657
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:10,079
for sure I totally will tweet Jesse's

658
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:12,440
pick I'm writing it and I've tried lots

659
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:14,839
of different styles of composting before

660
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:16,440
and this is hands down the easiest yeah

661
00:24:14,839 --> 00:24:17,720
that sounds like it's right up my alley

662
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,960
I'm super stoked cuz I'll be able to

663
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:20,880
have fresh compost all through the

664
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,360
winter I can can I put carrots and [ __ ]

665
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:25,440
in there oh yeah for yeah okay oh that

666
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:27,798
soil is ready to grow some [ __ ] dude oh

667
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:30,679
man yeah that's and just and then just

668
00:24:27,798 --> 00:24:32,879
add that to my organic base I'm going

669
00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:35,038
let it go for like a month is kind of

670
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:37,600
what I was reading from this guy um I'm

671
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:40,720
going to sift it out if it needs to be

672
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:42,359
which is like a a quarter inch screen um

673
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,960
you just take it all dump it on there

674
00:24:42,359 --> 00:24:47,639
sift it through it'll catch anything

675
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:49,759
that's not composted yet and then

676
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:52,640
everything that comes through is bam is

677
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:54,200
beautiful beautiful beautiful compost

678
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,600
that's a good idea you guys I'm sold on

679
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,720
that that was a quick rundown and I'm

680
00:24:55,599 --> 00:25:00,079
sold on that two 5 gallon buckets and

681
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:02,798
some table scraps in a bag of grok Kashi

682
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:04,720
and you were making awesome compost yeah

683
00:25:02,798 --> 00:25:05,918
let's see I got a picture of uh this was

684
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,558
day

685
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:10,799
one bunch of celery some oh coffee

686
00:25:08,558 --> 00:25:12,200
grounds are carbon too like some

687
00:25:10,798 --> 00:25:13,679
asparagus maybe in there she drinks

688
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,880
coffee so that would maybe some

689
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:17,840
asparagus in there something like that

690
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:20,880
so I'm a vegetarian and almost

691
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:22,798
everything I eat could go in yeah and

692
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:25,200
I've just you always got something yeah

693
00:25:22,798 --> 00:25:26,480
there's always watermelon has a rind

694
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,080
strawberries have that little green

695
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,519
thing at the tip everything's got

696
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:31,079
something some sort of waste to it

697
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:32,440
bananas have a peel like I was saying

698
00:25:31,079 --> 00:25:34,079
everything comes off the vine at some

699
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:35,960
point and where usually where it comes

700
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:39,759
off the vine We As Americans don't eat

701
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:41,880
that yeah I'm not Nigerian meme yeah you

702
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:43,798
could even experiment with some uh you

703
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:46,799
know scraps from different grows and

704
00:25:43,798 --> 00:25:48,679
stuff like that so yeah clean leaves

705
00:25:46,798 --> 00:25:51,398
good clean leaves old stems could be my

706
00:25:48,679 --> 00:25:53,320
uh my fiber part my carbon part for sure

707
00:25:51,398 --> 00:25:54,839
awesome that's a great idea man you guys

708
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:56,000
just learned something with me I'm glad

709
00:25:54,839 --> 00:25:57,359
we could all learn that together I guess

710
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,919
that's what you do with your fan leaves

711
00:25:57,359 --> 00:26:00,959
too when at the end that yeah that's

712
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:02,840
what I do for sure I'm tempted to buy a

713
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,480
juicer I also have another way of

714
00:26:02,839 --> 00:26:06,678
composting this is actually the E

715
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,798
easiest way of composting I've ever

716
00:26:06,679 --> 00:26:11,640
discovered uh I feed it to my

717
00:26:08,798 --> 00:26:13,398
chickens so but not everyone has that

718
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:17,240
luxury so they shoot it out at high

719
00:26:13,398 --> 00:26:19,038
nutrient levels yeah all right uh what

720
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:21,038
was I about to say oh

721
00:26:19,038 --> 00:26:22,319
uh I don't even remember there were so

722
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:23,960
many things happening to my brain just

723
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:26,240
now that's a lot let's get back on topic

724
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:28,170
here snot berries taste like what they

725
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:31,240
taste like snos berries

726
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:34,320
[Music]

727
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:35,480
yeah all the stuff we're uh we're eating

728
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:37,278
we should think about what we put into

729
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:38,679
ourselves cuz that's what we should be

730
00:26:37,278 --> 00:26:39,599
feeding our plants kind of the same way

731
00:26:38,679 --> 00:26:41,038
you don't want to feed your plants

732
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:43,678
watermelons but like think about what's

733
00:26:41,038 --> 00:26:44,640
in what your yeah think about your

734
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:46,000
health think about your plant Health

735
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,520
it's all the same [ __ ] once you start

736
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
paying attention you'll match up you'll

737
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:50,798
start feeling better uh you'll

738
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,038
definitely pay attention I noticed that

739
00:26:50,798 --> 00:26:54,879
from the last show that you were here

740
00:26:52,038 --> 00:26:58,359
and you said you know we we go out and

741
00:26:54,880 --> 00:27:00,600
we spend the money on expense bud and

742
00:26:58,359 --> 00:27:02,599
expensive water and then we just put 99

743
00:27:00,599 --> 00:27:05,879
cent I'm the worst at that dude and I'm

744
00:27:02,599 --> 00:27:07,719

little lady today and it was a great

754
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:32,360
time I I cook for her sometimes usually

755
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,440
she can't make bacon the best but you

756
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:34,839
know what I'm saying see well that's

757

your job then get in there and you make

758
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:39,959
the bacon that's why they say it making

759
00:27:36,558 --> 00:27:41,480
bacon making the bacon yep yep all right

760
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:43,919

761
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:45,960
bit a little bit but I don't know it's

762

following I mean I agree with you but I

764
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,159
mean we don't have to get back on track

765
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:53,599
at all that's you know what so let's

766
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:55,600
talk more about bacon you seen any good

767

781
00:28:26,359 --> 00:28:29,918
showing the fuzzies we've pulled our

782
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:32,159
males we've top dressed our worms are

783
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:34,640
happy uh We've switched to full bloom

784
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:36,720
nutrients you're feeding uh if you're

785
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:39,038
feeding feeding bottle nutrients go

786
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:41,440
lightly on the uh nitrogen there the

787
00:28:39,038 --> 00:28:44,558
grow or the bloom stuff now if you're

788
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:48,558
feeding teasan stuff what should we be

789
00:28:44,558 --> 00:28:51,440
mixing into our teas at this time um

790
00:28:48,558 --> 00:28:53,000
seabird guano uh that's pretty much

791
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:57,640
where I get all my nitrogen for the

792
00:28:53,000 --> 00:29:00,440
bloom phase from so um and then also

793
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:03,440
most ber guano's typically you know kind

794
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:06,919
of high NP um literally at least a

795
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:09,159
little bit yeah yeah this Show's Way Off

796

Track already today this is

797
00:29:09,159 --> 00:29:12,720
awesome all right I should have known

798
00:29:11,278 --> 00:29:15,519
that was coming from the look on your

799
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:17,720
face yeah we need a dab I think I'm

800

going to get dabs going for everybody so

801
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:24,120
seabird guano um what else you putting

802
00:29:20,398 --> 00:29:26,278
in there um the uh the I actually had a

803
00:29:24,119 --> 00:29:29,239
uh conversation with the gentleman about

804
00:29:26,278 --> 00:29:32,679
this earlier today but was it

805

00:32:00,038 --> 00:32:03,720
we were talking about good good good I

873
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:07,200
hope the listeners are taking dabs with

874
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:11,798
us fishbone Mill that's always high andp

875
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:14,720
that's some good stuff too um and uh I

876
00:32:11,798 --> 00:32:16,638
always go with the Kelps So and i' I've

877
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:19,639
noticed something I wonder what's up

878
00:32:16,638 --> 00:32:22,558
with this I've had some kelp that is

879
00:32:19,638 --> 00:32:24,079
one1 and then I just recently bought

880
00:32:22,558 --> 00:32:27,519
some kelp that is

881
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:29,519
001 it's the exact same strain or you

882
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:32,720
know the it says deriv from and it's

883
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:36,599
that whatever strain that you always see

884
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:38,519
but um yeah I wonder what what's up with

885
00:32:36,599 --> 00:32:39,678
that you know I don't pay enough

886
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:42,079
attention to the packaging I should

887
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:43,480
start looking at that more I know that's

888
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:45,319
there's certain things I never pay

889
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:47,599
attention to because you know the look

890
00:32:45,319 --> 00:32:49,678
on my face doesn't conve a podcast but

891
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:52,319
I've got a very curious look now like

892
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:54,159
huh do they make different packaging for

893
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:56,200
different runs or because you know stuff

894
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:58,919
like that it was different companies too

895
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:00,840
but still I mean where did the nitrogen

896
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:03,000
come from all of a sudden you know or

897
00:33:00,839 --> 00:33:05,158
yeah or it's supposed to be the same

898
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,558
product uh just different testing

899
00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:09,600
calibrations for sure yeah well it's

900
00:33:07,558 --> 00:33:11,759
supposed to be standardized though yeah

901
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:13,398
but you know a lot of [ __ ] is a lot of

902
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:15,398
[ __ ] is supposed to be standardized

903
00:33:13,398 --> 00:33:16,719
supposed to be supposed to yeah all

904
00:33:15,398 --> 00:33:18,239
right it's my turn uh I'm gonna take

905
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,600
this bag big dab I was going to give it

906
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,638
to Adam but I realized how big it is and

907
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:22,759
he doesn't want to do this he doesn't he

908
00:33:21,638 --> 00:33:24,519
doesn't do that sort of thing

909
00:33:22,759 --> 00:33:27,319
lightweight homie I should ask a

910
00:33:24,519 --> 00:33:31,038
question before I take a dab I asked

911
00:33:27,319 --> 00:33:33,079
about te I asked about feeding um it's

912
00:33:31,038 --> 00:33:34,839
time to finally train those things right

913
00:33:33,079 --> 00:33:36,038
if we want to do any LST training or

914
00:33:34,839 --> 00:33:38,038
anything like that we better do it

915
00:33:36,038 --> 00:33:39,599
before they start budding out like crazy

916
00:33:38,038 --> 00:33:41,720
give them some sticks to support

917
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:42,839
themselves I said support themselves

918
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:45,679
support with

919
00:33:42,839 --> 00:33:47,759
two I guess I'm excited about this dab

920
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:50,038
so tell us about what we need to do and

921
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:53,759
then we will talk about after that we'll

922
00:33:50,038 --> 00:33:56,000
talk about problems to look for and the

923
00:33:53,759 --> 00:33:57,359
biggest fear of all gardeners we'll talk

924
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,960
about those two things so I'm going to

925
00:33:57,359 --> 00:34:03,519
take a dab Jesse will

926
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:05,038
talk god um no I feel like I'm on a spot

927
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:06,440
you are you are I like how you got the

928
00:34:05,038 --> 00:34:10,480
mic right by your face D it's [ __ ]

929
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:14,398
awesome we can hear you so well nice um

930
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:17,000
let's see uh so we're [ __ ] I'm stoned um

931
00:34:14,398 --> 00:34:21,358
we're we're training so if you got the

932
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:22,838
bamboos um I kind of like to stick them

933
00:34:21,358 --> 00:34:27,719
in the grounded an

934
00:34:22,838 --> 00:34:29,480
angle um attach the plant at a at a

935
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:32,439
lower angle on the bamboo so that it's

936
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:34,320
still going past it are you angling in

937
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:36,639
toward the pot or out from the center of

938
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:38,919
the pot out from out just wanted to

939
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:41,760
clear that up um I've SE both methods

940
00:34:38,918 --> 00:34:44,398
yeah so so you actually want the the bud

941
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:48,240
dangling above the bamboo and that kind

942
00:34:44,398 --> 00:34:50,118
of gives it a chance to develop its uh

943
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:53,398
its girth and then it's going to kind of

944
00:34:50,119 --> 00:34:55,000
fall towards the bamboo and and you wrap

945
00:34:53,398 --> 00:34:58,799
it up kind of predict where it's going

946
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:01,559
to fall yeah um also I mean just

947
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:03,039
straight up bamboos um with Outdoors

948
00:35:01,559 --> 00:35:07,119
make sure you tie your plants in at

949
00:35:03,039 --> 00:35:10,039
least two places um the wind once you

950
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:13,240
start pinning plants with bamboos and

951
00:35:10,039 --> 00:35:16,960
steaks and stuff like that

952
00:35:13,239 --> 00:35:19,078
um uh you know it's you put them you

953
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:21,400
know this applies indoors too but uh

954
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:24,720
make sure you get them tied up in good

955
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:27,320
in two places real good um so that

956
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:29,559
anything doesn't break over that was

957
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:30,960
such a Stone ramble that it was perfect

958
00:35:29,559 --> 00:35:32,759
you said what exactly what needed to be

959
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,440
said while Adam and I both got to take a

960
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:36,599
dab and kind of get our [ __ ] back

961
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:38,119
together cuz I gave us big dabs um see

962
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:39,960
now I'm kind of new to the bamboo

963
00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:42,480
seeking just because I never had plants

964
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:44,440
big enough to even need stuff like that

965
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:46,000
for sure um I kind of asked him he told

966
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:47,760
me the same thing the other day and I

967
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,480
asked him you know what's really the

968
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,720
purpose of it and he's like you know

969
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,199
just to hold it there now I have a

970
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:53,799
tomato cage and I went out and I

971
00:35:52,199 --> 00:35:56,838
purchased the only sticks that were

972
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:59,720
because you know living here in Colorado

973
00:35:56,838 --> 00:36:01,759
Things Are not quite as available as you

974
00:35:59,719 --> 00:36:06,679
think they would be they sold the [ __ ]

975
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:08,480
out so um I had to you know I got little

976
00:36:06,679 --> 00:36:10,279
ones with the little rings in them that

977
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,599
I can just hold up my side cuz those are

978
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:13,040
the only ones for right now and I I

979
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:15,838
figure I can just tie it with a loose

980
00:36:13,039 --> 00:36:17,960
string um I got some branches coming in

981
00:36:15,838 --> 00:36:21,358
you know just holding it up against the

982
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:24,400
the the tomato cage so I mean yeah

983
00:36:21,358 --> 00:36:27,199
that's sounds like it's if nothing else

984
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:29,800
you could you know at maybe an earlier

985
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:32,078
stage run him through the tomato cage or

986
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:33,680
yeah that's yeah the way you did it is

987
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:35,318
perfect though uh the only thing that

988
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:36,879
Adam did wrong is he tried to put the

989
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:38,400
tomato cages on a little late so he had

990
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:40,519
to struggle with that next time I'll

991
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:42,440
show you a really smooth trick uh it

992
00:36:40,519 --> 00:36:44,199
just takes like a I use a twisty tie or

993
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:46,200
a [ __ ] like a pipe cleaner they're

994
00:36:44,199 --> 00:36:47,719
called fuzzy sticks just grab the plant

995
00:36:46,199 --> 00:36:49,358
from the bottom and go up and then just

996
00:36:47,719 --> 00:36:51,279
tie that [ __ ] in a couple of spots and

997
00:36:49,358 --> 00:36:53,159
then you could just slide the cage on uh

998
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:55,359
for the size cages I got I think it was

999
00:36:53,159 --> 00:36:56,598
still little too late for that cuz I I

1000
00:36:55,358 --> 00:36:58,239
tried that trick when I went out and

1001
00:36:56,599 --> 00:37:00,720
bought the last one and it was just like

1002
00:36:58,239 --> 00:37:02,118
no no nope so I just stuck it down in

1003
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:04,399
the middle and it kind of branched it

1004
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:06,559
all out yeah there you go you can also

1005
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:10,318
cut them open and then just wire them

1006
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:11,838
back together see Jesse's a thinker yeah

1007
00:37:10,318 --> 00:37:15,000
Jesse's a thinker didn't think about

1008
00:37:11,838 --> 00:37:19,159
that um but next year I plan to to have

1009
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:20,480
uh the small square um fence lines

1010
00:37:19,159 --> 00:37:22,679
around it maybe you know what I'm saying

1011
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:24,318
for sure yeah we're talking about that's

1012
00:37:22,679 --> 00:37:29,000
something that I've been seeing a lot

1013
00:37:24,318 --> 00:37:31,800
lately on YouTubes and know so um I

1014
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:34,760

1015
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:37,039
on one of those monsters the outside one

1016
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:39,160
actually sell a 16in tomato cage that

1017
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:40,880
comes apart it's uh the sticks are three

1018
00:37:39,159 --> 00:37:42,199
different pieces and the cage is two

1019
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,519
different Loops that come apart so you

1020
00:37:42,199 --> 00:37:46,039
can put that on after really endorse

1021
00:37:44,519 --> 00:37:47,599
those tomato cages those are [ __ ]

good product I like them actually might

1024
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:53,720
have learned about them through

1025
00:37:50,679 --> 00:37:55,598
subcool hey mine were 99 Cents so I I

1026

1027
00:37:55,599 --> 00:38:00,000
eror trying to get it on to something

1028
00:37:58,239 --> 00:38:02,879
all right that was Adam's words of

1029
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:06,639
wisdom yep uh so problems you guys were

1030
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:08,160
talking about moths and worms what the

1031
00:38:06,639 --> 00:38:11,358
[ __ ]

1032
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:14,519
um they are referred to in America as

1033
00:38:11,358 --> 00:38:17,598
corn borders and here's a little side

1034
00:38:14,519 --> 00:38:19,318
conversation um they're actually in

1035
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:23,680
Europe called a hemp

1036
00:38:19,318 --> 00:38:25,480
borer um when prohibition hit the wasn't

1037
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:28,919
any more hemp plants around so they went

1038
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:32,039
for corn and uh

1039
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:33,960
um J you know looking up a little bit on

1040
00:38:32,039 --> 00:38:35,559
him here yeah I'm Googling it right now

1041
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:38,280
sorry that's why I got quiet I know what

1042
00:38:35,559 --> 00:38:39,960
a hillbilly knows I don't know what a uh

1043
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:43,200
uh what he's about to read for us

1044
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:45,639
hopefully the European corn borer all

1045
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:46,960
right there you go uh well I'm just

1046
00:38:45,639 --> 00:38:49,000
reading it straight from Wikipedia the

1047
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:51,240
European corn worm or european corn

1048
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:54,719
borer also known as the European High

1049
00:38:51,239 --> 00:38:56,000
Fly is a pest of grain particularly maze

1050
00:38:54,719 --> 00:38:57,639
the insect is native to Europe

1051
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,760
originally infesting varieties of of

1052
00:38:57,639 --> 00:39:02,838
millet including broom corn it's an ugly

1053
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:05,640
[ __ ] bug dude

1054
00:39:02,838 --> 00:39:07,318
so huge yeah well it says the European

1055
00:39:05,639 --> 00:39:09,199
corn border caterpillars damage the ears

1056
00:39:07,318 --> 00:39:12,159
of corn as well as Stocks by chewing

1057
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:14,799
tunnels uh in which to which cause the

1058
00:39:12,159 --> 00:39:17,000
plant to fall over uh biological control

1059
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,480
agents of corn boers include uh sorry

1060
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,838
I'm just going to read that part yeah

1061
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:22,240
but they dig a tunnel in there I can't

1062
00:39:20,838 --> 00:39:24,440
say it and read it all and then they lay

1063
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:26,919
little eggs in there and then it shows

1064
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:29,960
these [ __ ] disgusting orange worms

1065
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:31,639
that grow out of there this is when I

1066
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:34,000
got all freaked out like what is this

1067
00:39:31,639 --> 00:39:35,838
dark spot on my plant you know this is

1068
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,559
the kind of stuff that I knew that stuff

1069
00:39:35,838 --> 00:39:40,838
will burrow and lay eggs inside of and

1070
00:39:38,559 --> 00:39:43,799
then rot from the inside out I've never

1071
00:39:40,838 --> 00:39:45,880
seen them like in the stalker okay mine

1072
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:47,480
were like right at the base like they

1073
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:49,599
lay clusters of eggs on the leaves

1074
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:51,719
usually the undersides and the Egg

1075
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:53,039
masses or clusters are laid on overlap

1076
00:39:51,719 --> 00:39:55,679
in an overlapping

1077
00:39:53,039 --> 00:39:57,759
configuration the larvae developed

1078
00:39:55,679 --> 00:40:00,159
inside the eggs and the eggs become more

1079
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:03,160
yeah so these things are ugly they

1080
00:40:00,159 --> 00:40:04,639
eventually turn into a flying insect I

1081
00:40:03,159 --> 00:40:06,318
believe correct yeah well they fly they

1082
00:40:04,639 --> 00:40:07,759
land on the plant they burrow in or they

1083
00:40:06,318 --> 00:40:09,039
lay eggs on the bottom then they turn

1084
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:11,920
into these worms that chew on your

1085
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:13,519
plants also so the original flying thing

1086
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,880
eat your plant the new worm they left

1087
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:16,159
eat your plant and then it turns into a

1088
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,400
flying thing that eats your plant and

1089
00:40:16,159 --> 00:40:20,598
comes back and drops more of these

1090
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:24,760
[ __ ] demon bugs on your plant uh yeah

1091
00:40:20,599 --> 00:40:28,519
terrible [ __ ] NY yeah um good ways to

1092
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:31,400
get rid of them um

1093
00:40:28,519 --> 00:40:34,199
prevention is the best way I've came up

1094
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:36,039
with um I've spent

1095
00:40:34,199 --> 00:40:39,719
hours

1096
00:40:36,039 --> 00:40:40,838
um picking them out by hand cuz wow they

1097
00:40:39,719 --> 00:40:42,759
they

1098
00:40:40,838 --> 00:40:44,559
destroy you know fortunately it's not

1099
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:49,119
going to destroy an entire crop they

1100
00:40:44,559 --> 00:40:50,519
destroy a piece of a bud okay um and

1101
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:52,880
when you're trimming at the end of the

1102
00:40:50,519 --> 00:40:54,639
year it is very easy to locate I've

1103
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,800
spotted those orange worms in there I

1104
00:40:54,639 --> 00:40:57,879
actually knew a guy that would dry and

1105
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:59,318
smoke those orange worms his grew that

1106
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:02,440
crop and he's like those are mine and he

1107
00:40:59,318 --> 00:41:03,320
loved it he loved it and you talk [ __ ]

1108
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:05,318
about

1109
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:06,960
[Laughter]

for uh our good old friend neem oil but

1115
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:23,519
it really sucks cuz you're spraying NE

1116
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:25,599
oil on a flower I was going to ask is

1117
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:28,679
that product okay with flowers but I

1118
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:32,680
mean not Nemo I know what NE oil does

1119
00:41:28,679 --> 00:41:36,440
yeah don't put NE oil on your flowers um

1120
00:41:32,679 --> 00:41:40,118
Monteray what can you do yeah I mean

1121
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:43,280
it's an organic it's a it's use it more

1122
00:41:40,119 --> 00:41:45,519
of a deterrent maybe um yeah that's I

1123
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:50,160
sprayed my plants with it um all through

1124
00:41:45,519 --> 00:41:51,719
veg religiously uh every 4 days they got

1125
00:41:50,159 --> 00:41:55,598
sprayed with something different mixed

1126
00:41:51,719 --> 00:41:58,039
it up kept it all organic and yep yeah

1127
00:41:55,599 --> 00:42:01,079
so something to scare those plants away

1128

right on the bottle uh spde kills a lot

1236
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:11,480
of uh insects that you'll find in the

1237
00:46:09,159 --> 00:46:13,399
garden yeah it's organic it's safe neem

1238
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:15,280
oil is also out there NE oil is there

1239
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:17,720

1240
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:19,720
veg often it's your friend uh it's cheap

1241

it's affordable you can dilute it uh and

1242
00:46:19,719 --> 00:46:23,039
you're really not going to hurt anything

1243
00:46:21,159 --> 00:46:25,920
unless you use it in flour even spray

1244
00:46:23,039 --> 00:46:27,279
the ground around it yeah um I saw a

1245
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:29,720
product I can't remember remember the

1246
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:32,680
name but it contains white oil it's a

1247
00:46:29,719 --> 00:46:34,558
little tiny bottle it's n bucks uh it's

1248
00:46:32,679 --> 00:46:36,480
got some white oil in it I have not used

1249
00:46:34,559 --> 00:46:39,880
it yet but I'm sure that that would

1250
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:41,760
knock out your flying insects and mites

1251
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:43,760
really quickly I'll have to research the

1252
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:45,960
name but look for it guys if you need

1253
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:48,079
some stuff you can actually get your

1254

1323
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:16,960
women bring down Grow rooms wait until

1324
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:19,440
the pot's harvested like I love you

1325
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:21,119
ladies I love the loyal ladies that are

1326
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:22,639
loyal to their man but some of you girls

1327
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:23,920
don't know when to stop talking about

1328
00:49:22,639 --> 00:49:26,358
the grow room that you saw and that's

1329
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:27,559
not your fault I may that's that guy's

1330
00:49:26,358 --> 00:49:29,199
fault for for taking you to the grow

1331
00:49:27,559 --> 00:49:31,559
room without knowing you well enough I

1332
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:33,759
may or may not have had a plant snapped

1333
00:49:31,559 --> 00:49:36,519
in half a couple

1334
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:39,599
times you know all right so this leads

1335
00:49:36,519 --> 00:49:42,000
us to something that we all dread other

1336
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:43,640
than the police in Colorado we don't

1337
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,039
worry a lot about the police anymore we

1338
00:49:43,639 --> 00:49:47,078
all obey the law we either have a

1339
00:49:45,039 --> 00:49:49,960
medical marijuana card or we are an

1340
00:49:47,079 --> 00:49:51,720
adult in Colorado any adult over 21 can

1341
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:53,400
grow six plants I think you're allowed

1342
00:49:51,719 --> 00:49:54,639
to grow six plants at any house I don't

1343
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,838
know that if Jesse and I lived in the

1344
00:49:54,639 --> 00:49:58,558
same house I don't know if we could grow

1345
00:49:55,838 --> 00:50:00,599
12 outside I don't know how that works

1346
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:02,079
but as a medical marijuana provider a

1347
00:50:00,599 --> 00:50:03,400
lot of us have increased counts you look

1348
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:07,039
like you might have something to add to

1349
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:09,079
that I've I've heard it does okay but

1350
00:50:07,039 --> 00:50:11,199
you know I don't want to be accused of

1351
00:50:09,079 --> 00:50:12,960
giving anyone legal advice yeah follow

1352
00:50:11,199 --> 00:50:14,358
the rules your homework I'm in that

1353
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:16,480
Spectrum you know what I'm saying of

1354
00:50:14,358 --> 00:50:18,078
where I'm allowed to have six plants but

1355
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:20,838
I'm allowed to have three flowering and

1356
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:22,480
three un not flowering right that's the

1357
00:50:20,838 --> 00:50:25,759
law in Colorado you can have six plants

1358
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:27,880
three in flower three not in flow um I

1359
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:29,319
don't know the the freaking Logistics or

1360
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:31,480
whatever the bottom end of the fine

1361
00:50:29,318 --> 00:50:33,440
print I don't know if if Adam and I and

1362
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:35,400
Jesse live together can we do 18 plants

1363
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:36,838
in the backyard I'm not sure they seem

1364
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:38,440
to kind of be up on that they kind of

1365
00:50:36,838 --> 00:50:39,639
seem to [ __ ] block a lot of those moves

1366
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:42,440
they're smart in Colorado they're

1367
00:50:39,639 --> 00:50:44,039
catching on anyway we digress Jesse's

1368
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:45,240
walking so he's tiptoeing and his

1369
00:50:44,039 --> 00:50:47,838
Jordans through the kitchen trying to

1370
00:50:45,239 --> 00:50:47,838
get a bottle of

1371
00:50:48,519 --> 00:50:55,199
water I actually heard a rumor that PUO

1372
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:58,639
county is going to instate a 18 plant

1373
00:50:55,199 --> 00:50:58,639
limit per household

1374
00:51:00,039 --> 00:51:05,599
total so that could happen that sounds

1375
00:51:02,679 --> 00:51:07,118
like [ __ ] that Pueblo does but uh yeah

1376
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:08,400
so we're allowed to have six plets God

1377
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:09,599
you just [ __ ] changed my whole

1378
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:12,200
thought process I don't like it we're

1379
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:14,240

1420
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,480
just something that needs to be

1421
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:47,318
mentioned recently in our community a

1422
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:48,798
13-year-old boy was shot in the back

the [ __ ] lights coming on you look on

1465
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,358
your security cameras that hopefully you

1467
00:54:11,358 --> 00:54:13,960
couple of seconds about things to do to

1468
00:54:12,719 --> 00:54:16,078
prevent some thieves but I want to set

1469
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:17,798
this story here what are you going to do

1470
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:19,280
those alarms are going off the [ __ ]

1471
00:54:17,798 --> 00:54:20,880
up on your security camera you can see

1472
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:23,599
them cutting down your plant he's about

1473
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:25,000
to it's a [ __ ] 19-year-old kid he's

1474
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:27,400
wearing a black hoodie you can't tell

1475
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:29,119
who he is cutting your [ __ ] down dude

1476
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:31,920
he's about to run out of your yard if

1477
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:34,680
you're in Colorado like a 90% chance

1478
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:36,838
there's a gun in your house probably you

1479
00:54:34,679 --> 00:54:39,039
got a baseball bat if you're a camper

1480
00:54:36,838 --> 00:54:40,599
you got a machete think about what

1481
00:54:39,039 --> 00:54:42,880
you're going to do because it it could

1482
00:54:40,599 --> 00:54:44,400
happen to you and you could walk out

1483
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:45,880
there and put yourself in a more

1484
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:48,119
dangerous situation than what you're

1485
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:49,880
ready for uh you could walk out there

1486
00:54:48,119 --> 00:54:51,720
and be like this guy in our town that

1487
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:53,838
shot somebody and has to deal with a kid

1488
00:54:51,719 --> 00:54:55,719
that could die right now and I don't

1489
00:54:53,838 --> 00:54:57,519
think that that kid's life was worth

1490
00:54:55,719 --> 00:54:58,838
anything in my my house if you want

1491
00:54:57,519 --> 00:55:00,039
something I'll let you have it and I

1492
00:54:58,838 --> 00:55:01,880
won't kill you and that sounds like

1493
00:55:00,039 --> 00:55:03,400
something [ __ ] stupid to say but if

1494
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:05,039
you need it that bad it's not worth

1495
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:06,720
killing you for I'll make more money

1496
00:55:05,039 --> 00:55:08,119
I'll grow more next year leave my mother

1497
00:55:06,719 --> 00:55:09,719

1498
00:55:08,119 --> 00:55:12,039
be just

1499
00:55:09,719 --> 00:55:15,159
fine well you have it like that whereas

1500
00:55:12,039 --> 00:55:17,239
somebody like me who is depending you

1501
00:55:15,159 --> 00:55:19,838
know on those three plants not only for

1502
00:55:17,239 --> 00:55:22,239
me but for my old lady you know and

1503
00:55:19,838 --> 00:55:23,960
it's it it would be rough for that you

1504
00:55:22,239 --> 00:55:25,239
know I would be I would be spending

1505
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:26,400
money every week well that's why I'm

1506
00:55:25,239 --> 00:55:27,959
trying to put that story in these

1507
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:29,599
Growers heads now these new folks heads

1508
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:31,559
that haven't had to deal with this let

1509
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:34,960
me break it down from the from the

1510
00:55:31,559 --> 00:55:36,880
suspects P perspective he's you know he

1511
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:42,400
got woken up at 2:30 in the morning he

1512
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:44,480
grabbed a air or a BB gun and he shot

1513
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:46,318
someone in his yard protecting his

1514
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:48,480
plants in an effort to protect his

1515
00:55:46,318 --> 00:55:49,558
plants well the cop showed up because he

1516
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:52,480
shot

1517
00:55:49,559 --> 00:55:55,760
someone and the cops saw his plants and

1518
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:58,039
he shot someone and the cops realized

1519
00:55:55,760 --> 00:56:00,640
that he valued his plants more than he

1520
00:55:58,039 --> 00:56:04,039
valued human life so now he's sitting in

1521
00:56:00,639 --> 00:56:09,078
a jail cell because these people

1522
00:56:04,039 --> 00:56:11,160
otherwise didn't you know he to Har yeah

1523
00:56:09,079 --> 00:56:12,798
well I'm I'm highly conflicted on this I

1524
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:14,480
don't know where it's that's why I tried

1525
00:56:12,798 --> 00:56:16,679
to not I said I'm not taking a side I

1526
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:18,760
wasn't there but I want what has

1527
00:56:16,679 --> 00:56:21,199
happened even if he gets away with it

1528
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:23,039
his face has been on the paper um his

1529
00:56:21,199 --> 00:56:25,000
plants are still there everyone in town

1530
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:26,799
knows they're there the the cops won't

1531
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:29,039
touch them cuz they're not going to

1532
00:56:26,798 --> 00:56:31,639
maintain that evidence so he's going to

1533
00:56:29,039 --> 00:56:34,839
have to uh spend lawyer fees he probably

1534
00:56:31,639 --> 00:56:37,798
lost his job his dad's been on the news

1535
00:56:34,838 --> 00:56:40,199
um and even if he gets away with it all

1536
00:56:37,798 --> 00:56:43,960
he still lost his plants was it worth it

1537
00:56:40,199 --> 00:56:48,279
mm no not at all and and a little boy

1538
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:50,000
has I mean so um just don't do it yeah

1539
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:52,359
even thinking that oh I'll just get him

1540
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:55,239

1546
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:05,599
said you can walk out and put yourself

1547
00:57:04,199 --> 00:57:07,078
in worse danger than what you were

1548
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:09,160
prepared for to deal with for those

1549

1553

00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:24,440
hopefully well yeah hopefully let them

1555
00:57:21,519 --> 00:57:26,719
go nuts turn the lights on yeah if you

1556
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:28,480

1557
00:57:26,719 --> 00:57:30,199
to scare them off you know maybe you got

1558
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:31,880
an elevated you know maybe you can walk

1559
00:57:30,199 --> 00:57:34,838
out on a back balcony or something like

1560
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:36,798
that you know just scaring them off you

1561
00:57:34,838 --> 00:57:38,679
know throwing a rock at them I don't see

1562
00:57:36,798 --> 00:57:40,239
you know yeah throw a rock F [ __ ] out of

1563

1566
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:48,119
the situation you know you can still

1567
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:50,440
literally hit somebody in the head with

1568
00:57:48,119 --> 00:57:52,240

some real good size damage that's true

1570
00:57:52,239 --> 00:57:56,759
that's true yeah so guys that's my point

1571
00:57:55,239 --> 00:57:58,598
is think about be prep what you're going

1572
00:57:56,760 --> 00:58:00,240
to do because I don't want you to have

1573
00:57:58,599 --> 00:58:01,640
to the only way to be prepared for that

1574
00:58:00,239 --> 00:58:03,159
situation is to think about it today

1575
00:58:01,639 --> 00:58:04,318
while I'm telling you about it so that

1576
00:58:03,159 --> 00:58:05,920
when someone's in your yard stealing

1577
00:58:04,318 --> 00:58:08,719
your [ __ ] you don't panic and [ __ ] your

1578
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:10,119
pants uh hopefully if you prepare for it

1579
00:58:08,719 --> 00:58:12,038
and think about it you've got a plan of

1580
00:58:10,119 --> 00:58:13,280
action uh you know how to get out there

1581
00:58:12,039 --> 00:58:15,160
quickly you know how to get rid of a

1582
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:17,079
thief I don't want anybody to try to be

1583
00:58:15,159 --> 00:58:18,639
a hero for a pot plant I don't want to

1584
00:58:17,079 --> 00:58:20,519
hear about anybody else shooting more

1585
00:58:18,639 --> 00:58:22,920
people for weed plants we don't need

1586
00:58:20,519 --> 00:58:26,480
that kind of publicity things are get to

1587
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:27,920
go to jail for you know anything you're

1588
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:32,679
a weed grower don't put that on the

1589
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:34,720
industry yeah just um yeah this we we

1590
00:58:32,679 --> 00:58:37,480
don't need that

1591
00:58:34,719 --> 00:58:39,598
so in Colorado we shouldn't be growing

1592
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:41,639
enough to make it worth robbing us which

1593
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:44,318
that sounds weird yeah and and don't

1594
00:58:41,639 --> 00:58:48,798
don't we're not defending thieves we're

1595
00:58:44,318 --> 00:58:51,480

1597
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:56,880

1598
00:58:54,719 --> 00:58:58,279
they take it all away from you

1599
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:59,880
and you know they leave it scattered

1600
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:02,319
down your alley so you have to clean it

1601
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:04,160
up at 8:00 in the morning and your

1602
00:59:02,318 --> 00:59:06,279
neighbors you know finally realized what

1603
00:59:04,159 --> 00:59:08,279
those you know it's just uh it's not

1604
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:10,079
worth it yeah I've had one plant taken

1605
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:11,720
from me I've grown one plant outside

1606
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:13,880
guess how many I got taken from me one

1607
00:59:11,719 --> 00:59:15,879
[ __ ] plant I lived in a snazzy

1608
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:17,400
neighborhood that plant was in a nice

1609
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:18,798
backyard tucked away I think the

1610
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:23,240
gardeners are the ones that [ __ ] took

1611
00:59:18,798 --> 00:59:26,159
that thing yeah I I have uh never grown

1612
00:59:23,239 --> 00:59:28,399
in my own yard before or anything like

1613
00:59:26,159 --> 00:59:32,639
like that um and the year I tried it it

1614
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:34,119
got taken so three plans so damn yeah so

1615
00:59:32,639 --> 00:59:36,159
I guess we've scared the [ __ ] out

1616
00:59:34,119 --> 00:59:37,358
everybody just be prepared guys I'm not

1617
00:59:36,159 --> 00:59:38,480
I don't know what you're going to do I

1618
00:59:37,358 --> 00:59:39,798
don't want you to shoot people I don't

1619
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:41,838
want you to fight people I want you to

1620
00:59:39,798 --> 00:59:44,280
protect your crop peacefully use your

1621
00:59:41,838 --> 00:59:45,599
voice scare the [ __ ] out of him put your

1622
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:48,319
if you look outside and it's your cousin

1623
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:50,119
Earl beat his [ __ ] ass yeah for sure

1624
00:59:48,318 --> 00:59:51,798
yeah yeah well I was going to I was

1625
00:59:50,119 --> 00:59:53,599
going to make the example if you're

1626
00:59:51,798 --> 00:59:55,239
stealing Adam's plants and he catches

1627
00:59:53,599 --> 00:59:57,240
you Adam's [ __ ] if he walks out and

1628
00:59:55,239 --> 00:59:58,879
tries to stop you if Adam's stealing

1629
00:59:57,239 --> 01:00:01,439
your plants and you catch them Adam is

1630
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:04,358
[ __ ] if you try to catch him so the

1631
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:06,240
array of outcomes could be very broad if

1632
01:00:04,358 --> 01:00:07,880
there's a thief in your yard cuz but

1633
01:00:06,239 --> 01:00:09,719
then again me knowing that I'm going to

1634
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:11,480
steal his plants I'm not probably not

1635
01:00:09,719 --> 01:00:12,598
coming with just my little skinny arms

1636
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:14,960
either you know what I'm saying and

1637
01:00:12,599 --> 01:00:16,920
that's and but you're going to his house

1638
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:18,519
so you know he's got more than his big

1639
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:20,798
ass arms in there well and that's and

1640
01:00:18,519 --> 01:00:23,480
that's where this all just keeps going

1641
01:00:20,798 --> 01:00:26,880
yeah very quickly and it is not worth it

1642
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:28,719
it's just a plant dude yeah some outside

1643
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:31,318
you should put some out outside next

1644
01:00:28,719 --> 01:00:33,598
month or next year and try again next

1645
01:00:31,318 --> 01:00:35,358
year grow indoors so don't shoot thieves

1646
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:37,559
that's my advice please jail sucks you

1647
01:00:35,358 --> 01:00:39,159
don't want to go to jail we need to talk

1648
01:00:37,559 --> 01:00:41,960
about if we don't want to lose our

1649
01:00:39,159 --> 01:00:45,440
plants and shoot people how can we

1650
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:47,679
prevent this uh dogs right big dogs

1651

1663
01:01:10,239 --> 01:01:14,318

he knows yeah he knows that those crops

1670
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:29,880
are important so uh also if your dog

1671
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:31,559
bites somebody you're going to have to

1672
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:32,480
[ __ ] deal with that yep uh they're

1673
01:01:31,559 --> 01:01:33,599
going to take your dog they're going to

1674
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:35,039
put your dog in quarantine make it

1675
01:01:33,599 --> 01:01:37,079
doesn't have make sure it doesn't have

1676
01:01:35,039 --> 01:01:38,280
rabies uh if your dog really eats the

1677
01:01:37,079 --> 01:01:41,119
[ __ ] out of somebody hopefully it

1678
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:43,640
doesn't come to that hopefully uh I want

1679
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:45,559
to use two dogs as examples uh if I got

1680
01:01:43,639 --> 01:01:48,038
into a yard and sarakan Nana rushed me

1681
01:01:45,559 --> 01:01:50,160
and barked at me I would be gone I'm not

1682
01:01:48,039 --> 01:01:52,880
a very good runner but I would run a

1683
01:01:50,159 --> 01:01:54,399
record lap with those two dogs behind me

1684
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:57,720
so hopefully that's all you got to do

1685
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:59,318

is and they're doing something uh you

1722
01:03:08,599 --> 01:03:13,920

1723
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:15,318
and and laws and all kinds of [ __ ] uh

1724
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:16,720
it's not going to take much to spook

1725
01:03:15,318 --> 01:03:18,400
them and it's likely somebody you know

1726
01:03:16,719 --> 01:03:19,798
so they don't want you to see their face

1727
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:21,920
or their clothes or their body don't

1728

1732
01:03:30,599 --> 01:03:37,599
had uh you know kind of made a big old

1733
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:40,440
freaking Bush out of one little thing um

1734
01:03:37,599 --> 01:03:42,318
the bamboo actually played uh it was

1735
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:44,838
hard for them to pull the plants out oh

1736
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:48,400
I bet you know I still had you know a

1737
01:03:44,838 --> 01:03:50,920
couple branches left to each one but um

1738

01:04:23,798 --> 01:04:27,679
[ __ ] and maybe share with them smoke out

1754
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:29,400
your neighbor and then they'll know that

1755
01:04:27,679 --> 01:04:31,000
that DK crop in the backyard they got to

1756
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:32,519
keep an eye on it too and then maybe

1757
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:34,440
they won't steal it from you cuz some

1758
01:04:32,519 --> 01:04:35,679
some neighbors will Jack your [ __ ] but

1759
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:37,159
then maybe if someone does come in the

1760
01:04:35,679 --> 01:04:38,598
yard they'll help you out also they'll

1761
01:04:37,159 --> 01:04:40,440
keep an eye on that [ __ ] because they

1762
01:04:38,599 --> 01:04:41,798
know that uh they've been keeping an eye

1763
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:43,480
on it maybe you'll throw them an ounce

1764
01:04:41,798 --> 01:04:46,278
or two when it gets done maybe they'll

1765
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:48,318
come over and help you trim you know our

1766
01:04:46,278 --> 01:04:50,278
neighbors on the farm are like that

1767
01:04:48,318 --> 01:04:51,719
that's that's far neighbors that should

1768
01:04:50,278 --> 01:04:53,318
be that way true true that's a little

1769
01:04:51,719 --> 01:04:55,919
different you guys aren't living in the

1770
01:04:53,318 --> 01:04:58,358
city yeah it's a whole new ball game now

1771
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:59,920
so I made a little Spike shape on my

1772
01:04:58,358 --> 01:05:01,000
paper here to remind me to talk about

1773
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:03,680
something a lot of you guys are going to

1774
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:05,278
set some kind of weird booby traps or

1775
01:05:03,679 --> 01:05:07,278
some kind of things for the thieves to

1776
01:05:05,278 --> 01:05:09,039
get hurt don't do that yeah we can't

1777
01:05:07,278 --> 01:05:10,318
condone that uh that's just like

1778
01:05:09,039 --> 01:05:11,520
shooting somebody it's just like letting

1779
01:05:10,318 --> 01:05:13,358
your dogs out you're going to get in

1780
01:05:11,519 --> 01:05:15,920
[ __ ] in trouble for that you can get

1781
01:05:13,358 --> 01:05:17,798
manslaughter uh I think it's also some

1782
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:21,400
places called Man

1783
01:05:17,798 --> 01:05:23,759
Trapping um don't don't do it yeah and

1784
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:26,000
it really really pisses cops off when

1785
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:27,920
they see it cuz they think oh I could

1786
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:30,559
have stepped in that that's mhm

1787
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:32,039
especially if you're in an illegal State

1788
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:33,960
what if they what if they arrest you at

1789
01:05:32,039 --> 01:05:35,520
the front door you know and they lead

1790
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:37,358
you to the car and they just go walking

1791
01:05:35,519 --> 01:05:39,400
around back and it's dark you know I

1792
01:05:37,358 --> 01:05:40,679
mean step on whatever you put down there

1793
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:43,160
and then you just assaulted a police

1794
01:05:40,679 --> 01:05:47,519
officer not not doing anything you're

1795
01:05:43,159 --> 01:05:49,759
handcuffed yep completely that's if if

1796
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:51,599
you're doing things like this that's

1797
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:53,440
you've probably got a substantial crop

1798
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:55,640
and um you're probably doing a lot of

1799
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:57,639
things wrong and you're not really doing

1800
01:05:55,639 --> 01:05:59,318
doing anyone but yourself there's those

1801
01:05:57,639 --> 01:06:01,038
uh somebody showed me a Google map I

1802
01:05:59,318 --> 01:06:04,038
might have talked about this a Google

1803
01:06:01,039 --> 01:06:05,960
map where there's a community in NorCal

1804
01:06:04,039 --> 01:06:09,200
where you can tell the same dude set up

1805
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:11,199
like seven lots of housing or it's like

1806
01:06:09,199 --> 01:06:13,318
Jesse owns one lot Adam owns another I

1807
01:06:11,199 --> 01:06:15,318
own another but since we're all allowed

1808
01:06:13,318 --> 01:06:18,440
to have yeah they just subdivided all

1809
01:06:15,318 --> 01:06:19,960
this land and set up gigantic crops and

1810
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:21,599
it looks like you built all of them it

1811
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:24,199
looks like one guy set up all these

1812
01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:25,838
crops for all these families so those

1813
01:06:24,199 --> 01:06:28,759
guys have a lot on the line man if

1814
01:06:25,838 --> 01:06:30,759
somebody goes in there and tries to take

1815
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:32,760
10 of those plants they've got a lot to

1816
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:35,119
[ __ ] lose those are five 10B plants

1817
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:38,200
each yeah but I would I would hope at

1818
01:06:35,119 --> 01:06:40,278
that point of scale you know you can pay

1819
01:06:38,199 --> 01:06:42,278
two dudes to sit around with flashlights

1820
01:06:40,278 --> 01:06:44,559
like someone's awake at all hours of the

1821

1970
01:12:07,079 --> 01:12:10,840
seen a professional comic so to say you

1971
01:12:09,359 --> 01:12:13,319
know what I'm saying besides when we

1972
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:15,159
went up to Denver but it was great man I

1973
01:12:13,319 --> 01:12:17,399
woke up in my cheeks and my ribs were

1974
01:12:15,158 --> 01:12:19,759
still sore from laughing so hard Absolut

1975
01:12:17,399 --> 01:12:21,638
my cheeks yeah uh Tony henchcliffe

1976
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:25,239
opened up for Joe Rogan at Comedy Works

1977
01:12:21,639 --> 01:12:27,520
last night uh he did 15 solid minutes

1978
01:12:25,238 --> 01:12:28,959
every second of his set was ripping yep

1979
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:30,320
it was he was a funny dude I've never

1980
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:32,198
heard of him before but he was

1981
01:12:30,319 --> 01:12:34,519
definitely an interesting comic uh he's

1982
01:12:32,198 --> 01:12:36,119
a little dark he's a little twisted and

1983
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:37,760
uh that's you're gr and you're like yeah

1984
01:12:36,119 --> 01:12:39,439
that's right up our alley so that was

1985
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:42,440
perfect and then uh of course Joe Rogan

1986
01:12:39,439 --> 01:12:44,158
is a legend uh he crushed it yeah uh he

1987
01:12:42,439 --> 01:12:47,119
came out a little bit nervous I felt

1988
01:12:44,158 --> 01:12:48,238
like but he used it he harnessed that

1989
01:12:47,119 --> 01:12:50,639
that's exactly I was going to say he

1990
01:12:48,238 --> 01:12:52,599
grabbed that energy and then somebody

1991
01:12:50,639 --> 01:12:54,239
tried to Heckle Joe Rogan about 10

1992
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:57,039
minutes into his set and that's when he

1993
01:12:54,238 --> 01:12:58,319
calmed he to Broke Free of the bubble of

1994
01:12:57,039 --> 01:13:00,198
I'm recording a show and he kind of

1995
01:12:58,319 --> 01:13:01,719
chewed that lady a tiny bit of a chewing

1996
01:13:00,198 --> 01:13:03,000
of a new [ __ ] he just made her feel

1997
01:13:01,719 --> 01:13:04,520
really stupid for a second like a

1998

episode posts all of you guys tell two

2126
01:17:19,639 --> 01:17:23,800
people and that way if one of them

2127
01:17:21,439 --> 01:17:25,359
listens to the show then we got 3,000

2128
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:26,719
listeners and that's when iTunes and

2129
01:17:25,359 --> 01:17:28,719
Stitcher really start paying attention

2130
01:17:26,719 --> 01:17:30,840
once you break that 2500 marker and

2131
01:17:28,719 --> 01:17:32,639
that's that's all the the ratings is

2132
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:34,600
really doing I mean it tells people that

2133
01:17:32,639 --> 01:17:36,199
the show is good but more than anything

2134
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:39,280
else it helps

2135
01:17:36,198 --> 01:17:41,119
your um relationship with iTunes or

2136
01:17:39,279 --> 01:17:43,119
Stitcher but when it moves us up in the

2137
01:17:41,119 --> 01:17:44,719
ranking it shows people that we exist

2138
01:17:43,119 --> 01:17:46,639
and then it's like uh it's just our

2139
01:17:44,719 --> 01:17:48,119
brand has more Integrity uh if more

2140
01:17:46,639 --> 01:17:49,480

2141

2142
01:17:49,479 --> 01:17:53,799
listening and so you know no you know

2143
01:17:51,639 --> 01:17:55,119
