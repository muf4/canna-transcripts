00:00:51,448 --> 00:00:55,198
disgusting but it is definitely an

13
00:00:53,369 --> 00:00:57,359
appealing aroma when it comes to a

14
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:59,369

all right podcast world I did say that I

58
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:29,640
was going to read an email about strains

59
00:02:27,209 --> 00:02:31,949
that I have bred let's jump right into

60
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:34,379
that this message came from our friend

61
00:02:31,949 --> 00:02:37,619
Andrew in Massachusetts and it goes just

62
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:39,889
like this hi raasta Jeff feel free to

63
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:41,670
use my name I'm Andrew from

64
00:02:39,889 --> 00:02:42,988
Massachusetts big shout out to my new

65
00:02:41,669 --> 00:02:45,719
friend Andrew thank you for the great

66
00:02:42,989 --> 00:02:47,370
email the question goes like this I was

67
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:49,409
wondering if you could do an episode on

68
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:50,759
some of your strains that are similar

69
00:02:49,409 --> 00:02:53,189
but different

70
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:55,199
lemon Jeffrey is feminized but how

71
00:02:53,189 --> 00:02:56,909
different is it from firefly or lemon

72
00:02:55,199 --> 00:03:00,030
sunrise or sonic boom

73
00:02:56,909 --> 00:03:02,969
or perhaps orange gasm versus sun kiss

74
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:05,430
maybe strawberry starburst versus pure

75
00:03:02,969 --> 00:03:07,409
love with some being so close

76
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:09,269
genetically like cousins or aunts or

77
00:03:07,409 --> 00:03:11,340
nieces I'm wondering if there will be

78
00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:13,560
noticeable differences between strains

79
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:16,259
or should I settle for whatever I can

80
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,150
find in stock I just chopped down my

81
00:03:16,259 --> 00:03:20,939
first arise and I could not be more

82
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:23,010
impressed I can't wait to run some more

83
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:26,159
I region etics and I just would like to

84
00:03:23,009 --> 00:03:28,620
get as clear an idea as possible of the

85
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:30,689
traits of anything that shares common

86
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:33,180
ancestry then they sign it with much

87
00:03:30,689 --> 00:03:35,789
love from Andrew hey Andrew there are a

88
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:38,250
lot of great questions in this email so

89
00:03:35,789 --> 00:03:39,810
let's get right to it and just to catch

90
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:42,120
people up just in case people are not

91
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:44,069
aware I am a seed breeder I am the sole

92
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,289
breeder for eye region attics premium

93
00:03:44,069 --> 00:03:48,719
seeds I make regular and feminized seeds

94
00:03:46,289 --> 00:03:50,639
I work with a strain called arise that

95
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:52,469
is one of my most popular females and of

96
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:54,988
course I use in a rise male plant for

97
00:03:52,469 --> 00:03:56,549
many other crosses I also have known for

98
00:03:54,989 --> 00:03:58,469
the lemon Jeffrey and a few others but

99
00:03:56,549 --> 00:04:00,000
let's focus more on the strains this

100
00:03:58,469 --> 00:04:01,650
person asked about I just wanted

101
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,469
everybody to know what this message

102
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:07,019
stemmed from so the first question is

103
00:04:04,469 --> 00:04:09,840
lemon Jeffrey is feminized but how

104
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:13,079
different is it from firefly or lemon

105
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,180
sunrise or even sonic boom so that is a

106
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:18,180
very good question because all of those

107
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:20,069
strains have very similar yet distinctly

108
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:22,228
different characteristics in the

109
00:04:20,069 --> 00:04:24,750
description and many of them have very

110
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:26,668
similar parents and their lineage so

111
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,670
let's talk about that lemon Jeffrey what

112
00:04:26,668 --> 00:04:30,759
is lemon Jeffrey

113
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:33,670
Jeffrey is a female golden goat it was

114
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:36,129
reversed to create feminized pollen

115
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:39,430
I used that feminized pollen on a female

116
00:04:36,129 --> 00:04:42,159
Lemon skunk that is what created lemon

117
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:44,620
Jeffrey lemon Jeffrey is a reversed

118
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,270
golden goat to a female Lemon skunk I've

119
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:48,639
done a full Episode on lemon Jeffrey I

120
00:04:46,269 --> 00:04:50,349
go into great detail on that strain for

121
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:54,310
this episode we will describe it as a

122
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:56,290
tropical lemon candy flavored sativa

123
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:58,750
dominant hybrid that's a really quick

124
00:04:56,290 --> 00:05:01,330
description but then how is the lemon

125
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:03,370
Jeffrey different from Firefly that is a

126
00:05:01,329 --> 00:05:06,039
really good question let's talk quickly

127
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:09,189
about Firefly Firefly is a cross of

128
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:11,950
lemon skunk and arise lemon skunk is the

129
00:05:09,189 --> 00:05:14,649
same lemon skunk as used in the lemon

130
00:05:11,949 --> 00:05:17,740
Jeffrey cross so that is lemon skunk to

131
00:05:14,649 --> 00:05:19,479
arise it is very similar to the lemon

132
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:22,449
Jeffrey but you are going to get some

133
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:24,430
sort of funky gassy it doesn't have this

134
00:05:22,449 --> 00:05:26,050
sweet tropical flavor from the golden

135
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:27,879
goat as much in there it does have

136
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:29,410
golden goat but it has only got a

137
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:31,329
quarter of the golden goat in its

138
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:33,040
lineage as compared to half so we've

139
00:05:31,329 --> 00:05:35,229
watered down the golden goat a little

140
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:37,480
bit we've put some og cush and Kim D

141
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:39,550
flavors in there it's very similar to

142
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:42,160
the lemon Jeffrey however it is not

143
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:45,579
feminized the main difference is the

144
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:47,140
flavor and the aroma the Firefly will

145
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:48,789
get a little bit funkier it's got a

146
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:50,529
little bit more of a lemon pledge sort

147
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:53,200
of a thing and it also grows a little

148
00:05:50,529 --> 00:05:55,989
bit taller with a little bit more dense

149
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:58,599
of a bud structure the next one you

150
00:05:55,990 --> 00:06:00,069
asked about is the lemon sunrise and

151
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,660
that's a really good question how is

152
00:06:00,069 --> 00:06:05,430
lemon Jeffrey different from lemon

153
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:08,650
sunrise lemon sunrise was my non

154
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:12,040
feminized response to requests for

155
00:06:08,649 --> 00:06:13,959
non-fan lemon Jeffrey many people fell

156
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:16,540
in love with lemon Jeffrey but they did

157
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:18,189
not like feminized seeds many people

158
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:20,439
have a preference of feminized or non

159
00:06:18,189 --> 00:06:22,990
Femmes that is up to you many people did

160
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:26,079
not want feminized lemon Jeffery seeds

161
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:29,110
so I pollinated the lemon Jeffrey with

162
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:32,050
my prized arise male and that made lemon

163
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:33,759
sunrise now let's backtrack and talk

164
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:36,280
about the differences between the

165
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:38,230
firefly and the lemon sunrise these are

166
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:40,779
both regular seeds these are non

167
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:41,408
feminized strains so let's talk about

168
00:06:40,779 --> 00:06:43,778
the

169
00:06:41,408 --> 00:06:47,528
Firefly like I said earlier has more of

170
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:50,740
the skunky dank funky aroma I say more

171
00:06:47,528 --> 00:06:53,228
of a stank lemon flavor the lemon

172
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:55,960
sunrise is going to have a softer

173
00:06:53,228 --> 00:06:58,478
sweeter lemon flavor so if you're

174
00:06:55,959 --> 00:07:01,149
looking for lemon pledge gassy dirty

175
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:03,668
feet and lemons lemons and funk lemons

176
00:07:01,149 --> 00:07:05,888
and cush the Firefly is the way to go

177
00:07:03,668 --> 00:07:08,468
there if you want more of a softer

178
00:07:05,889 --> 00:07:10,840
sweeter lemon sorbet kind of a flavor

179
00:07:08,468 --> 00:07:12,550
the lemon sunrise is the route for that

180
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:15,128
one the Firefly and the lemon sunrise

181
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:16,689
will grow very similarly the Firefly

182
00:07:15,129 --> 00:07:18,669
will make a little bit more dense of a

183
00:07:16,689 --> 00:07:20,710
bud the lemon sunrise will make a little

184
00:07:18,668 --> 00:07:22,778
airier of a bud but it's going to get a

185
00:07:20,709 --> 00:07:24,248
little bigger of a but also it will

186
00:07:22,778 --> 00:07:26,379
weigh the same in the end

187
00:07:24,249 --> 00:07:27,759
now let's backtrack even more and talk

188
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:30,189
about the lemon Geoffrey and how it

189
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:32,139
varies from all of those the lemon

190
00:07:30,189 --> 00:07:34,930
Geoffrey is different from the Firefly

191
00:07:32,139 --> 00:07:36,908
because it is straight soft lemon head

192
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:38,560
candy flavors I describe it as if you

193
00:07:36,908 --> 00:07:41,079
dumped out a box of lemon heads and

194
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,199
smelled the Box it's really soft it is

195
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:45,758
really smooth it's kind of lemon sorbet

196
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:48,189
country time lemonade powder it's more

197
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,199
gentle as the way I explain it but it is

198
00:07:48,189 --> 00:07:51,789
feminized that's how that one really

199
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:54,218
stands out from the rest of the crowd

200
00:07:51,788 --> 00:07:55,899
now there is another cross that is very

201
00:07:54,218 --> 00:07:58,538
similar in this mix which you asked

202
00:07:55,899 --> 00:08:02,019
about which is the sonic boom sonic boom

203
00:07:58,538 --> 00:08:05,019
is actually lemon og haze cross to arise

204
00:08:02,019 --> 00:08:06,549
lemon og haze came from our friends at

205
00:08:05,019 --> 00:08:08,079
ethos collective big shout out to my

206
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:10,419
buddy Collin they're doing great work

207
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:12,338
over there the lemon og haze I

208
00:08:10,418 --> 00:08:14,318
discovered her in a commercial facility

209
00:08:12,338 --> 00:08:17,319
and I fell in love with that plant

210
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,848
immediately it grows like a champ you

211
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:20,680
can't beat it up you can't cause it

212
00:08:18,848 --> 00:08:22,628
problems you can't stress it out it

213
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:24,370
doesn't like spider mites and it just

214
00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:26,830
seemed to eat like a champ and no matter

215
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:28,629
what we did do it it put out giant colas

216
00:08:26,829 --> 00:08:31,088
that always smell like lemon lime

217
00:08:28,629 --> 00:08:33,219
Gatorade and I [ __ ] love it so that's

218
00:08:31,088 --> 00:08:36,038
where the lemon og haze came from I

219
00:08:33,219 --> 00:08:38,800
cross that to my arise my goal was to

220
00:08:36,038 --> 00:08:41,348
increase the vigor and potency of the

221
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:44,979
lemon og haze and it absolutely worked

222
00:08:41,349 --> 00:08:47,290
it is more of a gatorade lemon-lime sort

223
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:49,060
of a flavor more than the lemon flavor

224
00:08:47,289 --> 00:08:51,818
of the other strains we've talked about

225
00:08:49,059 --> 00:08:54,369
previously the sonic boom does not have

226
00:08:51,818 --> 00:08:54,939
the lemon skunk as the lemon Jeffrey the

227
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:57,370
Firefly

228
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:59,710
or the lemon sunrise would carry him

229
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:01,929
there so that is going to be a vastly

230
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:04,509
different cross from the other three you

231
00:09:01,929 --> 00:09:06,159
will see very large differences so I

232
00:09:04,509 --> 00:09:09,429
think that wraps up the talk about the

233
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:11,289
lemon Jeffrey versus Firefly lemon

234
00:09:09,429 --> 00:09:14,019
sunrise and sonic boom just quickly

235
00:09:11,289 --> 00:09:15,669
lemon Jeffrey is a feminized seed so

236
00:09:14,019 --> 00:09:16,929
that's why it stands out mainly it

237
00:09:15,669 --> 00:09:19,659
produces that soft

238
00:09:16,929 --> 00:09:22,329
lemon lemon head country time lemonade

239
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:24,339
flavor sort of a thing then the Firefly

240
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:26,980
is that same lemon skunk cross to the

241
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:29,350
arize it's more of a cushy gassy stinky

242
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:31,659
lemon the lemon sunrise is the lemon

243
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:33,639
Jeffrey to arise that brings the sweet

244
00:09:31,659 --> 00:09:36,309
lemon it brings a hint of the gas but

245
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:37,960
not nearly as much as the Firefly then

246
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:40,569
we've got the sonic boom and that is a

247
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:42,610
vastly different flavor profile

248
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:44,650
completely different bud structure it

249
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:46,840
lacks all of the lemon skunk traits

250
00:09:44,649 --> 00:09:49,029
because it does not have the lemon skunk

251
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:50,170
in there at all so now let's move

252
00:09:49,029 --> 00:09:52,419
forward to the second part of the

253
00:09:50,169 --> 00:09:55,000
question which is orange gasm versus

254
00:09:52,419 --> 00:09:57,490
Sunkist I like that one a lot the common

255
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,370
parent in orange gasm and Sunkist is a

256
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:01,930
platinum tangi plant Platinum tangi came

257
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:04,990
from our friends at garden of Weeden

258
00:10:01,929 --> 00:10:08,199
that is a female Platinum Girl Scout

259
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:10,360
cookies pollinated by a male tangey

260
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:13,120
plant that was known as julius and that

261
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:14,830
makes platinum tangi I really like the

262
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,340
platinum tangi plant for a lot of

263
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:18,610
reasons

264
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:20,290
it stays short it grows nice and squat

265
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:22,690
instead of getting tall and lanky it

266
00:10:20,289 --> 00:10:25,269
makes a nice wide Bush I like the shape

267
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:26,950
I like the structure it grows very

268
00:10:25,269 --> 00:10:30,279
easily it does not have a lot of

269
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:32,890
problems it finishes fairly early it has

270
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:35,919
nice robust stalks so it doesn't need a

271
00:10:32,889 --> 00:10:38,289
lot of support it has a very nice leaf

272
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:40,509
shape and structure and the leaves that

273
00:10:38,289 --> 00:10:42,279
need to be d foliated are very obvious

274
00:10:40,509 --> 00:10:42,759
because of the size and shape of the

275
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:45,549
leaves

276
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:47,080
I like how early it finishes then when

277
00:10:45,549 --> 00:10:48,549
you're done growing it what stands out

278
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:51,820
about the finished product is this

279
00:10:48,549 --> 00:10:54,399
amazing orange flavor the oranges are

280
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:55,900
super strong then on the exhale you get

281
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,850
a hint of that Girl Scout cookie

282
00:10:55,899 --> 00:11:00,009
funkiness and I really think it makes a

283
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:01,779
beautiful balance so that is the

284
00:11:00,009 --> 00:11:03,700
platinum tangi that comes from our

285
00:11:01,779 --> 00:11:05,079
friends at garden of Weeden I fell in

286
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:07,360
love with that one in a commercial

287
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:08,410
facility I acquired a cut and I've been

288
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,870
working with it for

289
00:11:08,409 --> 00:11:13,269
years I have made quite a few strains

290
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:16,209
from that cut the orange gasm and the

291
00:11:13,269 --> 00:11:17,919
Sunkiss and also the Michelangelo come

292
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:19,869
from that cut so let's talk a little bit

293
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:23,439
about the differences between orange

294
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:26,438
gasm and Sunkist orange gasm is the

295
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:29,019
Platinum tangi cut pollinated by that

296
00:11:26,438 --> 00:11:30,759
reversed golden goat that makes lemon

297
00:11:29,019 --> 00:11:32,620
Jeffrey those are made side by side

298
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:35,050
orange gasm and lemon Jeffrey are made

299
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:38,259
in the same room from the same reversed

300
00:11:35,049 --> 00:11:41,438
golden goat so it is a platinum tangi

301
00:11:38,259 --> 00:11:43,289
female pollinated by a reversed golden

302
00:11:41,438 --> 00:11:46,568
goat that one brings out a lot of

303
00:11:43,289 --> 00:11:48,338
citrusy sweet orange flavors you will

304
00:11:46,568 --> 00:11:52,349
get a little bit of orange rind in there

305
00:11:48,339 --> 00:11:54,279
some phenotypes may Express a flavor of

306
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:56,439
grapefruit there will be a hint of

307
00:11:54,278 --> 00:11:58,809
grapefruit Terps in there that is not

308
00:11:56,438 --> 00:12:02,169
the most common aroma or flavor but it

309
00:11:58,809 --> 00:12:04,750
will pop up in some phenotypes now let's

310
00:12:02,169 --> 00:12:07,750
talk about the Sun kiss Sun kiss is that

311
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:10,688
same platinum tangi female pollinated by

312
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:12,938
the arise now we are going to see a lot

313
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:15,879
of similarities in the orange gasm and

314
00:12:12,938 --> 00:12:17,588
the Sun kiss because the arize also has

315
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:20,438
the golden goat golden goat is the

316
00:12:17,589 --> 00:12:21,850
mother of arise but we are also going to

317
00:12:20,438 --> 00:12:24,578
get a little bit of funk in there

318
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:26,110
because it's also got chem d and joseph

319
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:27,879
OG so we're gonna get some of the

320
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:29,318
Daybreaker traits we're going to get a

321
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:31,448
rise traits and we're going to get those

322
00:12:29,318 --> 00:12:34,208
platinum cookies and the tangi traits in

323
00:12:31,448 --> 00:12:36,729
their most phenotypes of the Sunkiss

324
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:38,979
stay short and squat and grow bushy the

325
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:40,509
orange gasm will do that as well but the

326
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:42,339
main difference you are going to see is

327
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:45,188
that we may get a little bit taller

328
00:12:42,339 --> 00:12:46,180
phenotypes from the Sunkist and we may

329
00:12:45,188 --> 00:12:49,059
get longer

330
00:12:46,179 --> 00:12:51,879
finishing phenotypes from the Sun kiss

331
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:54,938
and we also may get a hint of funkier

332
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:57,278
nasty or cushier aromas from the sun

333
00:12:54,938 --> 00:12:59,919
kiss the main difference is that those

334
00:12:57,278 --> 00:13:01,899
are a regular and a feminized seed line

335
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:03,909
that is the main outstanding difference

336
00:13:01,899 --> 00:13:05,679
between the two of those let's talk a

337
00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:07,139
little bit about the michelangelo since

338
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:10,120
we're here you didn't mention that one

339
00:13:07,139 --> 00:13:12,698
Michelangelo is that same platinum tangi

340
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:15,429
female pollinated by a reversed

341
00:13:12,698 --> 00:13:18,188
blueberry cookies female they made

342
00:13:15,429 --> 00:13:22,079
pollen so we've created the Michelangelo

343
00:13:18,188 --> 00:13:24,689
feminized wine Michelangelo

344
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:26,460
has the same growth characteristics as

345
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:29,160
the orange gasm and the Sunkist

346
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:31,019
generally short squatty plants about

347
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:32,490
eight-week finishers you will find some

348
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:34,559
outliers and all of these that are

349
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:36,419
shorter and longer finishers but

350
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:40,199
generally we've got short squatty plants

351
00:13:36,419 --> 00:13:42,179
with a very orange dominant aroma the

352
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:44,640
difference with the Michelangelo is that

353
00:13:42,179 --> 00:13:48,779
we bring a little bit of a drapey blue

354
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:50,789
raspberry funky sort of a blue nerds

355
00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:52,169
maybe those blue lollipops we used to

356
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:53,819
suck on when we were kids that turned

357
00:13:52,169 --> 00:13:55,799
our whole face blue it's got a hint of

358
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:58,080
that flavor to it it's kind of like we

359
00:13:55,799 --> 00:14:00,120
took some oranges and rolled them around

360
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:02,340
in grape fun dip or something like that

361
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:04,950
or a blue raspberry fun dip it is a

362
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:08,129
really neat flavor combination very

363
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:09,509
candy very orange e very funky then

364
00:14:08,129 --> 00:14:11,730
sometimes you'll get a hint of that

365
00:14:09,509 --> 00:14:13,950
cookies from the Tahoe and the cookies

366
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:15,930
in the background so the Michelangelo is

367
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:18,030
very similar to the orange gasm and the

368
00:14:15,929 --> 00:14:19,469
Sunkist but it also has a little pizzazz

369
00:14:18,029 --> 00:14:21,149
to it it's got a little bit of blue

370
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:23,310
color on there and I know it sounds

371
00:14:21,149 --> 00:14:25,289
crazy that I express flavors in colors

372
00:14:23,309 --> 00:14:26,699
but if you think about it when you see

373
00:14:25,289 --> 00:14:28,319
red stuff you always think it's either

374
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,820
fruit punch or strawberry if you see

375
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,080
blue [ __ ] you think it's blueberry when

376
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:33,330
you see orange you think it's orange

377
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:35,730
flavored my brain works very much in

378
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:38,220
that sort of a thing that is why the

379
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:39,750
TMNT line got named the way it did I've

380
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:41,910
explained that before let's keep moving

381
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:43,950
here let's recap on the main differences

382
00:14:41,909 --> 00:14:46,740
on the orange gasm the Sunkist and the

383
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:49,110
Michelangelo orange gasm is feminized

384
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:51,690
Michelangelo is feminized the main

385
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:54,029
difference is Sunkist is a non feminized

386
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:56,640
version of these lines it is a regular

387
00:14:54,029 --> 00:14:58,799
seed Sunkist is going to be completely

388
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:01,080
orange II a little bit of funky orange

389
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:03,029
gasm orange II maybe a little bit more

390
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:04,860
citrus maybe some grapefruit in the

391
00:15:03,029 --> 00:15:06,870
Michelangelo you're going to get oranges

392
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:09,060
with all those blue and purple flavors

393
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:11,460
attached to that let's move forward and

394
00:15:09,059 --> 00:15:13,859
talk about strawberry starburst versus

395
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:16,320
pure love those are very different

396
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:18,570
crosses the strawberry starburst is

397
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,879
strawberry fields from Crockett family

398
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:23,640
farms that one I acquired at another

399
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:26,909
commercial facility it grows giant colas

400
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:28,500
that smell like strawberry candies I was

401
00:15:26,909 --> 00:15:29,969
always satisfied with the harvest weight

402
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:32,309
and the appearance but I was never

403
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:34,769
satisfied with the potency so my goal

404
00:15:32,309 --> 00:15:35,609
was to pollinate it with my King Solomon

405
00:15:34,769 --> 00:15:37,679
and increase

406
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:40,409
the potency of the Strawberry Fields

407
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:43,559
that created strawberry starbursts I hit

408
00:15:40,409 --> 00:15:46,889
my goal spot on with that one pure love

409
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:49,529
is a cross of Zack Hayes to arise Zack

410
00:15:46,889 --> 00:15:51,779
Hayes is killer Hayes and Strawberry

411
00:15:49,529 --> 00:15:54,149
Cough so the strawberry flavors are very

412
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:56,209
different than the strawberry starburst

413
00:15:54,149 --> 00:15:58,620
flavor this is more of a an actual

414
00:15:56,210 --> 00:16:00,570
strawberry aroma the strawberry

415
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:03,120
starburst is more like a strawberry gum

416
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:04,500
a strawberry candy it's also been

417
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,240
described as those candies that your

418
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,500
grandma has in the candy dish it's

419
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,450
wrapped in the strawberry looking

420
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:11,129
wrapper the strawberry starburst has

421
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:14,040
that flavor the pure love is more like a

422
00:16:11,129 --> 00:16:15,210
an actual strawberry air freshener sort

423
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:17,399
of a thing there's a big difference

424
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:19,650
there in my opinion but the pure love

425
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:21,629
has some haze in it so you're going to

426
00:16:19,649 --> 00:16:23,250
get the killer haze traits are going to

427
00:16:21,629 --> 00:16:24,720
pop out of there that is going to make

428
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:26,250
the plants take a little bit longer to

429
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,259
finish they're going to get a little bit

430
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:30,059
taller they're going to have possibly

431
00:16:28,259 --> 00:16:30,629
more of like a psychedelic sort of a

432
00:16:30,059 --> 00:16:32,819
buzz

433
00:16:30,629 --> 00:16:35,340
so the strawberry starburst is a little

434
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:37,560
bit more candy bubblegummy possibly

435
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:39,210
watermelon the pure love you're going to

436
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:41,069
get more of the funky aroma from the

437
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:42,509
arize they've both got the arize parent

438
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:44,070
in there you're gonna get some of that

439
00:16:42,509 --> 00:16:46,289
funk in there from the arize it comes

440
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:48,780
more dominantly in the pure love so if

441
00:16:46,289 --> 00:16:50,250
you want strawberry candy watermelons if

442
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:52,409
you want something to press and make

443
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:54,570
rosin out of strawberry starbursts is

444
00:16:52,409 --> 00:16:56,490
the way to go if you're gonna make pho

445
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:58,230
out of it pure love is the way to go

446
00:16:56,490 --> 00:17:00,360
that one's got a little bit more of a

447
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:02,310
real strawberry flavor as compared to

448
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:03,750
the artificial candy and it's also gonna

449
00:17:02,309 --> 00:17:06,720
bring a little bit of that dirty foot

450
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:08,279
gassy cushy sort of a flavor another one

451
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,279
we should include in there is the

452
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:13,319
Raphael Raphael is the strawberry

453
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:15,199
starburst pollinated by that blueberry

454
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:17,730
cookies that I talked about earlier

455
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:20,009
Raphael brings that really sweet

456
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:23,190
strawberry candy flavor but it's also

457
00:17:20,009 --> 00:17:25,289
got that blue raspberry funky Wang to it

458
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:27,029
those blue and purple flavors added on

459
00:17:25,289 --> 00:17:30,210
top of it it really makes it really

460
00:17:27,029 --> 00:17:31,799
unique strawberry blueberry combination

461
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:33,660
it's really fruity it's really

462
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:35,759
bubblegummy it can almost be a

463
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:36,960
watermelon blueberry bubblegum sort of a

464
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:39,539
thing there are a lot of really unique

465
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,279
flavors that come from that so the main

466
00:17:39,539 --> 00:17:43,139
difference between strawberry starburst

467
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:45,359
and pure love strawberry starburst is

468
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:46,680
going to be more strawberry candy pure

469
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:49,139
love you're gonna get some of that gas

470
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:49,610
and then Raphael is strawberries with a

471
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:52,250
way

472
00:17:49,609 --> 00:17:55,219
to it and of course the Raphael is a

473
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:57,380
feminized line the other two are regular

474
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:59,269
seeds so I'm sure by now you've noticed

475
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:01,610
that I am using a lot of the same

476
00:17:59,269 --> 00:18:03,109
strains in a lot of my crosses I'm just

477
00:18:01,609 --> 00:18:05,119
using different pollen donors on

478
00:18:03,109 --> 00:18:06,919
different females to create diversity

479
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:09,919
and kind of branch out a little bit I'm

480
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:12,320
using several females I am mainly using

481
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:15,048
that King Solomon as my main real male

482
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:17,269
I'm also using several females and

483
00:18:15,048 --> 00:18:19,849
reversing them to create more crosses

484
00:18:17,269 --> 00:18:22,099
from proven and trusted females which I

485
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:24,199
know are reliable I've been working with

486
00:18:22,099 --> 00:18:26,449
many of these crosses for several years

487
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:28,700
I've got a very verified stable I know

488
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:30,319
that everything I've got is exactly what

489
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:31,789
it is labeled I know where it came from

490
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:33,619
I know where that person got it I've

491
00:18:31,789 --> 00:18:35,509
bred with it I've tested all of these

492
00:18:33,619 --> 00:18:38,209
things several times so I've got a very

493
00:18:35,509 --> 00:18:40,279
nice stable to work with my downfall or

494
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:43,160
my limiting factor is that I am limited

495
00:18:40,279 --> 00:18:45,678
by the number of plants I can keep

496
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:47,480
because of Colorado laws I do have

497
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:48,650
access to commercial facilities and I

498
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:50,690
work with large groves

499
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:52,610
but most of my breeding happens in a

500
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:54,289
personal grow so I am limited to the

501
00:18:52,609 --> 00:18:56,029
amount of mother plants I can keep I'm

502
00:18:54,289 --> 00:18:58,460
limited to the amounts I can flower at a

503
00:18:56,029 --> 00:19:00,980
time so that really makes my number of

504
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:02,870
keeper plants limited yes I do have

505
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:04,429
friends that can keep plants for me I do

506
00:19:02,869 --> 00:19:06,139
have plenty of other friends around here

507
00:19:04,429 --> 00:19:07,790
that do have gardens that maybe I can

508
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:09,770
have them keep my mother's but as a

509
00:19:07,789 --> 00:19:11,210
breeder as somebody who relies on this

510
00:19:09,769 --> 00:19:12,798
is like part of my life somebody who I

511
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:14,240
think I'm in love with these plants know

512
00:19:12,798 --> 00:19:16,668
I know I'm in love with these plants I

513
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:19,730
don't want to rely on anybody else to

514
00:19:16,669 --> 00:19:22,309
keep my genetics my business my passion

515
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:24,440
alive so I do my best to keep my very

516
00:19:22,308 --> 00:19:26,629
favorite mothers to where I can keep my

517
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:28,039
selected moms my selected males and then

518
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:30,140
I still have enough room on my plant

519
00:19:28,039 --> 00:19:32,240
count to do some pollination to make

520
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:34,009
some new crosses then occasionally I

521
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,480
have to call a few things I have to

522
00:19:34,009 --> 00:19:37,490
sprout some seeds and I have to start

523
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:39,410
fresh with lower numbers so that's why

524
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:40,759
you see a lot of repeats and a lot of

525
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:43,370
things from the same sort of lines

526
00:19:40,759 --> 00:19:45,769
working in my projects they are trusted

527
00:19:43,369 --> 00:19:47,509
they are proven and as a breeder that is

528
00:19:45,769 --> 00:19:49,279
part of what you rely on me for and

529
00:19:47,509 --> 00:19:51,470
that's what I rely on myself and my

530
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:53,599
testers to test these lines for the

531
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:56,410
lines that come out in 2020 have been

532
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:59,299
being tested since 2019 and possibly

533
00:19:56,410 --> 00:20:00,950
2018 so sometimes it takes me a little

534
00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:02,659
while to get products out because I want

535
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:03,440
to thoroughly test them to make sure

536
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:05,389
that when you

537
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,429
your money you were getting a reliable

538
00:20:05,388 --> 00:20:08,719
seed pack that when you grow that you'll

539
00:20:07,429 --> 00:20:10,759
have something worth showing off

540
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,259
something worth consuming something to

541
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:14,028
make it worth off your time your energy

542
00:20:12,259 --> 00:20:16,429
your effort and your money because I

543
00:20:14,028 --> 00:20:18,679
know how much effort and dedication we

544
00:20:16,429 --> 00:20:20,240
put into our grows so my main limiting

545
00:20:18,679 --> 00:20:22,639
factor to keep my breeding from

546
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,409
expanding is plant counts I'm only

547
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:26,778
allowed to have so many plants but like

548
00:20:24,409 --> 00:20:28,820
I said oftentimes I do coal things I

549
00:20:26,778 --> 00:20:30,919
either get new plants from friends and I

550
00:20:28,819 --> 00:20:33,109
breed with those then I make sure that

551
00:20:30,919 --> 00:20:34,759
that offspring is worth using I will

552
00:20:33,109 --> 00:20:36,740
send out those seeds to friends I will

553
00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:38,210
grow those seeds myself sometimes I have

554
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:40,069
friends in commercial facilities that

555
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:41,419
will let me run a hundred seeds in one

556
00:20:40,069 --> 00:20:43,490
of their test rooms then I can really

557
00:20:41,419 --> 00:20:45,710
see what's happening there sometimes

558
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:47,089
I scrap projects sometimes I say we

559
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:49,490
probably shouldn't give these seeds out

560
00:20:47,089 --> 00:20:51,230
to people sometimes I go holy [ __ ] I

561
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:53,210
cannot wait to get these seeds out to

562
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:54,649
people but when I make a first cross I

563
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:56,690
don't make a lot of them the first time

564
00:20:54,648 --> 00:20:58,908
I'll make a couple of hundred so we can

565
00:20:56,690 --> 00:21:00,350
test it then if it's good then I go back

566
00:20:58,909 --> 00:21:02,090
and I make enough for we can actually

567
00:21:00,349 --> 00:21:04,038
get it out to people so it is a long

568
00:21:02,089 --> 00:21:06,259
process making testing and verifying

569
00:21:04,038 --> 00:21:08,089
seeds and I am mainly limited by the

570
00:21:06,259 --> 00:21:10,399
amount of keepers that I can keep

571
00:21:08,089 --> 00:21:12,019
because of Colorado laws but there were

572
00:21:10,398 --> 00:21:13,908
more questions in this email it said

573
00:21:12,019 --> 00:21:15,740
with some of your strains being so close

574
00:21:13,909 --> 00:21:17,450
genetically like cousins or aunts and

575
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:20,120
nieces I'm wondering if there will be

576
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:22,399
noticeable differences between strains

577
00:21:20,119 --> 00:21:25,729
or if I should just settle on whatever I

578
00:21:22,398 --> 00:21:27,918
can find in stock depending on which

579
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:30,378
strains you were referring to you may

580
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:32,240
see very subtle differences some of them

581
00:21:30,378 --> 00:21:34,548
may be so close that you may just want

582
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,470
to grab what is in stock since I am only

583
00:21:34,548 --> 00:21:38,929
able to keep so many mother plants and

584
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:41,000
father plants some strains will never be

585
00:21:38,929 --> 00:21:43,370
made again so once they sell out they

586
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,019
are gone I've got a jar of those seeds I

587
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:47,329
make a bunch of packages they're

588
00:21:45,019 --> 00:21:48,048
requested by the vendors they sell then

589
00:21:47,329 --> 00:21:49,668
that is it

590
00:21:48,048 --> 00:21:51,798
I cannot make any more of those because

591
00:21:49,669 --> 00:21:53,538
I was forced or I chose to get rid of

592
00:21:51,798 --> 00:21:55,759
one of the mother plants or the father

593
00:21:53,538 --> 00:21:57,740
plant or part of that cross and I can no

594
00:21:55,759 --> 00:22:00,200
longer make it so I would grab what is

595
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:02,480
in stock when you can if you can't find

596
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:04,759
the exact strain you were looking for

597
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,829
the last paragraph of this email says I

598
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:08,839
just chopped down my first runner of a

599
00:22:06,829 --> 00:22:11,538
rise and I could not be more impressed

600
00:22:08,839 --> 00:22:13,849
that is awesome I would love to see some

601
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:15,378
photos of your arise if you didn't get

602
00:22:13,849 --> 00:22:16,309
photos while I was growing I hope to see

603
00:22:15,378 --> 00:22:19,159
photos of your

604
00:22:16,309 --> 00:22:21,019
to grow of I read genetics seeds it goes

605
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:23,300
on to say I cannot wait to run more I

606
00:22:21,019 --> 00:22:25,190
regen etics just would like to get as

607
00:22:23,299 --> 00:22:27,799
clear an idea as possible of the traits

608
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:29,090
of anything that shares common ancestry

609
00:22:27,799 --> 00:22:31,490
I think I did a pretty good job of

610
00:22:29,089 --> 00:22:33,529
giving you descriptions of things with

611
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:35,089
very similar traits and similar parents

612
00:22:33,529 --> 00:22:37,549
if you've got more questions I would

613
00:22:35,089 --> 00:22:39,409
love a follow-up email you know my email
