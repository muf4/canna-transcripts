behind bars for two decades a period in

71
00:02:29,789 --> 00:02:34,859
which the nation's attitudes toward pot

72
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:36,539
have steadily softened family friends

73
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:38,370
supporters and reporters flocked to meet

74
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:40,199
Jeff Minsky as he stepped out of the

75
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:42,569
Jefferson City Correctional Center into

76
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:44,250
a sunny morning wearing a pair of white

77
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:46,500
tennis shoes and a shirt that read I'm

78
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:47,939
Jeff and I'm free I want a shirt that

79
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:51,150
says I'm Jeff and I'm free

80
00:02:47,939 --> 00:02:53,550

81
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:54,840
keep going it says he says I spent a

82
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:57,300
third of my life in prison said

83
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,650
mizanskey now 62 who was greeted by his

84
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:01,650
infant great-granddaughter

85
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:03,599
it's a shame after a breakfast of steak

86
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:05,099
and eggs with family Lozinski said he

87
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,810
planned to spend his post prison life

88
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:08,099
seeking a job in advocating for the

89
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:09,960
legalization of marijuana

90
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:11,609
he criticized sentencing for some

91
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:14,030
drug-related crimes is unfair and

92
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:16,500
described his time behind bars as hell

93
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:18,840
his release followed years of lobbying

94
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,490
by relatives lawmakers and others who

95
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,140
argue that the sentence was too stiff

96
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:25,439
and that marijuana should not be

97
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:27,000
forbidden Basinski was sinced in 1996

98
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:28,829
the same year California became the

99
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,050
first state to legalize marijuana for

100
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:33,750
medical purposes medical marijuana is

101
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:35,640
now legal in 23 states and recreational

102
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:38,069
marijuana has been legalized in Alaska

103
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:40,679
Colorado Oregon Washington State and

104
00:03:38,069 --> 00:03:42,239
Washington DC the reason he's getting

105
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,310
out is because the public clearly has

106
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:46,200
changed it's changed its opinion about

107
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:48,840
marijuana and it's just one of many ways

108
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:50,609
in which that has been reflected in

109
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:53,550
recent years said Mo's in skis attorney

110
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:55,230
Dan meets such extreme cases should

111
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:56,820
further feel changing perceptions of

112
00:03:55,229 --> 00:03:59,280
nonviolent drug crime sent Michelle

00:04:09,389 --> 00:04:13,079
don't have to say that [ __ ] in my title

120
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:15,299
every day I say hi I'm Rasta Jeff so

121
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,799
much easier the article says these cases

122
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:19,680
really become Exhibit A and the need for

123
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:21,870
sentencing reform said D I think that's

124
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,629
how you said that an attorney and expert

125
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:26,759
in criminal justice policy just last

126
00:04:24,629 --> 00:04:28,290
year the heavily Republican Missouri

127
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:29,909
legislature passed a law

128
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:31,830
to allow certain people of epsilen

129
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:34,770
epilepsy to seek treatment with the

130
00:04:31,829 --> 00:04:36,209
marijuana extracting extract containing

131
00:04:34,769 --> 00:04:38,430
little of the chemical that causes

132
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:39,870
marijuana users to feel high and larger

133
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:42,660
amounts of a chemical called Kenna

134
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:45,180
cannabidiol or CBD the patients can

135
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:46,620
include babies Veet said nobody saw that

136
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:49,230
coming he said that's a pretty radical

137
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:51,149
statement police said he conspired to

138
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:52,920
sell six pounds of marijuana to a dealer

139
00:04:51,149 --> 00:04:54,870
connected with the Mexican drug cartels

140
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:57,030
at the time the life with no parole

141
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:59,430
sentences was allowed under a Missouri

142
00:04:57,029 --> 00:05:01,199
law for repeat drug offenders mizanskey

143
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:03,240
already had to drug convention

144
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,370
convictions one for possession and one

145
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:07,439
for sale of marijuana in 1984 and

146
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:10,590
another for possessing possession in

147
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:11,819
1991 he was the only Missouri inmate

148
00:05:10,589 --> 00:05:13,709
serving such a sentence for a

149
00:05:11,819 --> 00:05:15,509
non-violent marijuana related offense

150
00:05:13,709 --> 00:05:17,639
when Democratic governor jay Nixon

151
00:05:15,509 --> 00:05:20,279
agreed in May to commute his sentence

152
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:21,870
the commutation allowed mizanskey to

153
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:23,609
argue for his freedom before a parole

154
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:24,269
board which granted his request in

155
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:26,699
August

156
00:05:24,269 --> 00:05:28,560
Nixon Nixon's actions are a reflection

157
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:30,899
of political confidence in changing

158
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,509
norms around marijuana use said Cecilia

159
00:05:30,899 --> 00:05:34,919
clincal a criminal justice policy expert

160
00:05:33,509 --> 00:05:37,439
at the University of Wisconsin law

161
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:39,360
school the governor cited mizanskey 's

162
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:40,980
nonviolent record noting that none of

163
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,629
his offenses involved selling drugs to

164
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:44,400
children the law under which he was

165
00:05:42,629 --> 00:05:47,790
originally sentenced has since been

166
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:49,620
changed other states are reevaluating

167
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:52,590
punishment for drug possession crimes

168
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:54,569
motivated in large in large part by the

169
00:05:52,589 --> 00:05:56,969
high cost of imprisoning low-level

170
00:05:54,569 --> 00:05:58,769
nonviolent offenders you guys imagine

171
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:00,600
how much it cost to keep this dude in

172
00:05:58,769 --> 00:06:02,250
prison for twenty years we could have

173
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,230
sent people to it cost more money to

174
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:06,360
send people to prison for years than it

175
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:08,400
does to send somebody to college is what

176
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,900
I recently read we probably could've

177
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:11,219
send three or four he was in there for

178
00:06:09,899 --> 00:06:13,379
twenty years probably could've sent five

179
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:15,330
or ten people to college for the cost

180
00:06:13,379 --> 00:06:18,600
that it cost to house him and nothing

181
00:06:15,329 --> 00:06:20,759
came of it maybe maybe in the long term

182
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,320
he will affect people being released

183
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:23,430
maybe he did some good I think that's

184
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,529
called a martyr is that what he was

185
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:27,209
maybe he was a martyr so maybe it was

186
00:06:25,529 --> 00:06:28,889
worth it for the movement but not for

187
00:06:27,209 --> 00:06:30,389
him and not for you no but they could

188
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:32,129
have [ __ ] educated some people for

189
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:33,750
this cost I'm gonna keep reading my

190
00:06:32,129 --> 00:06:35,009
article here it says in Connecticut a

191
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:36,480
new law will make possession of small

192
00:06:35,009 --> 00:06:38,819
amounts of hard drugs including heroin

193
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:40,319
cocaine and crack cocaine a misdemeanor

194
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:41,668
for a first-time offense rather than

195
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,129
allowing for the current maximum

196
00:06:41,668 --> 00:06:45,748
seven year prison sentence Nebraska and

197
00:06:44,129 --> 00:06:47,310
Alabama expect to save hundreds of

198
00:06:45,749 --> 00:06:48,840
millions of dollars by using new laws to

199
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:50,490
cut down on the number of offenders

200
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:53,158
locked up for possessing small amounts

201
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:55,110
of drugs in Missouri backers of two

202
00:06:53,158 --> 00:06:57,060
ballot initiatives to legalize pot have

203
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:58,889
permission from the Secretary of State

204
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:01,319
to begin collecting signatures to put

205
00:06:58,889 --> 00:07:03,598
the issue before voters in 2016

206
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:05,550
another petition proposes reducing

207
00:07:03,598 --> 00:07:06,748
sentences for nonviolent drug offenders

208
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:09,449
who were serving time without

209
00:07:06,749 --> 00:07:11,069
opportunity for parole mizanskey said he

210
00:07:09,449 --> 00:07:13,499
will not smoke marijuana now that he's

211
00:07:11,069 --> 00:07:15,090
free he's on parole after all but if it

212
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:17,629
ever becomes legal on the state and

213
00:07:15,089 --> 00:07:20,489
federal level mizanskey said definitely

214
00:07:17,629 --> 00:07:21,960
so big congratulations welcome home I

215
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:23,908
think he's gonna help out the movement

216
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:25,680
if they're releasing one guy why aren't

217
00:07:23,908 --> 00:07:27,509
they gonna start releasing all of the

218
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,939
people who are in jail anybody that

219
00:07:27,509 --> 00:07:31,770
committed any nonviolent cannabis crime

220
00:07:29,939 --> 00:07:33,689
I think they should all just start

221
00:07:31,769 --> 00:07:35,908
releasing them just go and lock the cage

222
00:07:33,689 --> 00:07:37,528
and let those dudes out and I'm a joint

223
00:07:35,908 --> 00:07:39,329
and a hundred bucks and sent them on

224
00:07:37,528 --> 00:07:42,810
their way all right

225
00:07:39,329 --> 00:07:45,750

226

recently let me see if they tell you in

231
00:07:56,278 --> 00:08:00,240
this okay there was recently a bunch of

232
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,459
marijuana products in Colorado that were

233
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,829
taken off of the shelves because they

234
00:08:02,459 --> 00:08:08,370
were suspected of having been produced

235
00:08:04,829 --> 00:08:11,639
with cannabis that had been sprayed with

236
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:15,000
pesticides that are banned from the

237
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:16,228
marijuana production laws we have what's

238
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,240
called the marijuana Enforcement

239
00:08:16,228 --> 00:08:20,158
Division and they have made laws in

240
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,949
conjunction with the Department of

241
00:08:20,158 --> 00:08:25,218
Agriculture to regulate the sprays that

242
00:08:22,949 --> 00:08:28,649
can be put on these plants so recently

243
00:08:25,218 --> 00:08:30,509
on the first a bunch of these edibles

244
00:08:28,649 --> 00:08:32,309
and products were taken off of shelves

245
00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:35,459
because they were suspected to have been

246
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:37,918
made with contaminated cannabis I had

247
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:39,869
that article planned to read to you when

248
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:41,250
I opened up my computer today and went

249
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:43,139

250
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:45,870

251
00:08:43,139 --> 00:08:48,448

lifted so I'm gonna say that one more

254
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:54,940
time just to make it clear a denver pot

255
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:58,509
products passed pesticide test and the

256
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:59,950
has been lifted the sub-headline says

257
00:08:58,509 --> 00:09:02,289
marijuana products from mountain high

258
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:04,810
suckers and MMJ America showed no trace

259
00:09:02,289 --> 00:09:06,639
of an unapproved pesticide did among

260
00:09:04,809 --> 00:09:09,759
their ingredients the company owners

261
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:10,299
said they were using old labeling so

262
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:12,730
here we go

263
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:14,500
now this articles by David McCoy from

264
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:16,750
The Denver Post I found it on the

265
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:18,519
cannabis and it goes like this Denver

266
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:20,230
Health officials Wednesday lifted a day

267
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:22,329
old order to hold hundreds of marijuana

268
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:24,879
infused lozenges and raw marijuana from

269
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:27,700
two businesses after lab tests showed no

270
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:29,679
trace of unapproved pesticides did among

271
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:31,840
their ingredients the owners of Mountain

272
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:33,219
High suckers and MMJ America each said

273
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:35,110
they had been using old labels they

274
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:37,120
included among their ingredients a

275
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:40,419
pesticide that today is not approved for

276
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:42,159
marijuana use the pesticide spinosad had

277
00:09:40,419 --> 00:09:44,169
not been barred for use when the labels

278
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:46,360
were made the owner said it looks like

279
00:09:44,169 --> 00:09:48,610
this was just an unfortunate labeling

280
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:51,580
issue said dan roland denver spokesman

281
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:53,289
for its office for its office of

282
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:55,180
marijuana policy sorry for my stumble

283
00:09:53,289 --> 00:09:56,620
there a state law requires marijuana

284
00:09:55,179 --> 00:09:58,989
companies to list on their product

285
00:09:56,620 --> 00:10:00,490
labels all pesticides contaminates and

286
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:03,039
herbicides used in the production

287
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:04,690
process the city's enforcement action is

288
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:06,669
the latest in a series of actions

289
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:07,960
related to pesticides used on

290
00:10:06,669 --> 00:10:10,059
recreational and medical marijuana

291
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:12,310
because the drug remains illegal under

292
00:10:10,059 --> 00:10:14,139
federal law the US Environmental

293
00:10:12,309 --> 00:10:16,469
Protection Agency will not establish any

294
00:10:14,139 --> 00:10:19,179
allowable pesticide uses on marijuana

295
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:21,070
technically no regulated pesticide can

296
00:10:19,179 --> 00:10:23,139
be legally used on marijuana but state

297
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:24,790
agriculture officials have said as long

298
00:10:23,139 --> 00:10:26,259
as its use does not violate it

299
00:10:24,789 --> 00:10:29,199
pesticides label warnings and

300
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:31,080
restrictions it can be used on Monday

301
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,700
Denver Warren businesses that products

302
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:35,889
listing of unapproved pesticides should

303
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:38,410
be removed from shelves and destroyed or

304
00:10:35,889 --> 00:10:40,000
returned to the manufacturer inspectors

305
00:10:38,409 --> 00:10:42,549
ordered tests on the product holds

306
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,019
Tuesday after spotting spinosad listed

307
00:10:42,549 --> 00:10:46,750
among other ingredients of mountain

308
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:49,990
highs lozenges and raw marijuana at MMJ

309
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:52,629
America shop on a rapaho Street excuse

310
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:55,060
me the test did not detect spinosad city

311
00:10:52,629 --> 00:10:56,830
officials confirmed mountain-high had

312
00:10:55,059 --> 00:10:58,359
been using old labels from when it

313
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:59,950
purchased marijuana trimming from a

314
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:02,050
grower that had been using spinosad

315
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:04,300
mountain-high co-owner Chad Tribble said

316
00:11:02,049 --> 00:11:06,338
that was before the state said it could

317
00:11:04,299 --> 00:11:07,879
not he said back then it wasn't a

318
00:11:06,339 --> 00:11:10,430
problem Tribble said

319
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:12,379
he just didn't look back on the labels

320
00:11:10,429 --> 00:11:14,329
it was a mistake it was on there but the

321
00:11:12,379 --> 00:11:17,870
tests were clear undetected we've never

322
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:19,790
had a black mark before now said now he

323
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:22,519
said news of the city's action brought

324
00:11:19,789 --> 00:11:23,990
calls from as far as Las Vegas not only

325
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:26,090
did we test negative for all pesticides

326
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:27,440
we were told by the city that just

327
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:28,820
crossing off the name because we're

328
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,610
already had the bags printed was

329
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:33,590
acceptable MMJ owner Jake Salazar

330
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:35,360
that's what MMG owner Jake Salazar said

331
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:37,389
officials later told him he needs to

332
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:40,789
reprint the labels we ordered

333
00:11:37,389 --> 00:11:42,830
pre-printed bags 70,000 units every time

334
00:11:40,789 --> 00:11:44,809
last time we ordered them this wasn't a

335
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:46,340
banned substance we now have to throw

336
00:11:44,809 --> 00:11:48,589
all of those bags away and reorder

337
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:50,930
70,000 more without that ingredient

338
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:53,300
which we clearly don't use Salazar said

339
00:11:50,929 --> 00:11:55,009
the state's list of pesticides approved

340
00:11:53,299 --> 00:11:57,500
for use on marijuana has been in the

341
00:11:55,009 --> 00:11:59,269
drafting stage for about 18 months the

342
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:01,129
state will not say the pesticides are

343
00:11:59,269 --> 00:12:02,840
safe for use on marijuana only that

344
00:12:01,129 --> 00:12:05,740
their use does not violate label

345
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:08,509
restrictions on how they should be used

346
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:09,980
some pesticides are so non-toxic that

347
00:12:08,509 --> 00:12:12,439
the EPA does not require them to be

348
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:13,940
registered nor restrict their use those

349
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,920
can be used on marijuana but the

350
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:17,660
industry has complained that they aren't

351
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:19,610
potent enough to eradicate the kinds of

352
00:12:17,659 --> 00:12:21,409
pests in mildews that can decimate a

353
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:24,110
crop potentially worth millions of

354
00:12:21,409 --> 00:12:28,219
dollars the city in the spring held more

355
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:30,649
than 100,000 marijuana plants at 11 grow

356
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:33,350
operations over concerns that unapproved

357
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:35,750
pesticides had been used on them so this

358
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:39,230
article was from David McCoy and those

359
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:41,450
products did not test for spinosad they

360
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:43,399
were using old labels now this really

361
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:46,490
sparks a little bit of question in my

362
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:49,459
mind because I advocate spinosad I like

363
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:51,740
spinosad I've used a spinosad recently

364
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:53,629
so this has me thinking I need to go in

365
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:55,490
here and go to the Department of

366
00:12:53,629 --> 00:12:57,889
Agriculture website and figure out why

367
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:58,340
or whichever website it is it may be the

368
00:12:57,889 --> 00:13:00,350
meed

369
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:02,330
I need to go and figure out why I'm not

370
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:05,350
allowed to use spinosad because I run a

371
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:07,759
shop I run a grow at a shop I need to

372
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:09,230
find this list of pesticides I'm not

373
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:11,269
quite sure where I find this list of

374
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:13,129
pesticides I'm sure that the operations

375
00:13:11,269 --> 00:13:14,809
manager at the dispensary has it so I

376
00:13:13,129 --> 00:13:15,919
asked him for that list we're not at

377
00:13:14,809 --> 00:13:18,349
that point yet so I don't need to know

378
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:20,209
that but I'm sure the marijuana

379
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:21,000
Enforcement Division webpage has a list

380
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:22,830
of approved

381
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,419
or unapproved pesticides all we got to

382
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:26,070
do is go there and look I really want to

383
00:13:24,419 --> 00:13:29,399
know why spinosad has been banned cuz I

384
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:31,160
use that quite quite often I will

385
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:35,480
definitely figure out why because

386
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:38,219
something that will help prevent this um

387
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:42,330
every dispensary will now be required to

388
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:44,610
Train all plant handlers in pesticide

389
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:46,950
management everybody every dispensary

390
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:49,529
needs on staff one person that can train

391
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:51,840
every new employee on pesticide safety

392
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:53,909
and to be able to train them you have to

393
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:55,410
be certified by the Department of

394
00:13:53,909 --> 00:13:58,559
Agriculture you have to take an

395
00:13:55,409 --> 00:14:00,269
applicator safety test and I have been

396
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:02,879
required to do that since I am the lead

397
00:14:00,269 --> 00:14:04,679
grower at this spot dispensary so I will

398
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:06,509
be taking I will be studying and taking

399
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:08,429
that test and then I will know a lot of

400
00:14:06,509 --> 00:14:12,000
stuff about pesticides and we will find

401
00:14:08,429 --> 00:14:13,559
out why spinosad is unacceptable um the

402
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,269
Department of Agriculture representative

403
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:17,269
actually told me the reason that Eagle

404
00:14:15,269 --> 00:14:20,759
20 is not allowed in commercial grows

405
00:14:17,269 --> 00:14:23,429
drumroll please because when it burns it

406
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:25,169
turns into cyanide that's what the guy

407
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:27,239
from the Department of Agriculture told

408
00:14:25,169 --> 00:14:29,819
me it had nothing to do with the danger

409
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:31,409
and toxicity of the chemical it was

410
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:33,690
actually because when it turns if

411
00:14:31,409 --> 00:14:35,100
there's a fire it turns into cyanide and

412
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:37,050
the fire department doesn't want to deal

413
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:39,330
with that I found that rather

414
00:14:37,049 --> 00:14:42,539
interesting all right guys I have got

415
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:44,700
one more news article this one is from

416
00:14:42,539 --> 00:14:46,649
local news here this one comes from the

417
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:48,750
beautiful city of Pueblo Colorado I

418
00:14:46,649 --> 00:14:51,659
talked a little bit about Pueblo last

419
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:53,940
time on the last episode talking about

420
00:14:51,659 --> 00:14:55,289
how Colorado and Pueblo in general was

421
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:57,360
booming with cannabis and Pueblo

422
00:14:55,289 --> 00:14:59,759
Colorado may become the may already be

423
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:02,070
the new Emerald triangle so this article

424
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:05,029
says funding college scholarships via

425
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:08,100
pot grows proposed in southern Colorado

426
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:09,389
so the headline says gosh excuse my

427
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:11,040
throat I'm gonna take a drink before we

428
00:15:09,389 --> 00:15:14,480
even get into this I'm gonna take a

429
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:14,480
drink and then I'm gonna take a DAB

430
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:22,899
alright that was a good drink excuse the

431
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:24,550
throat-clearing on the podcast I

432
00:15:22,899 --> 00:15:27,129
probably won't even edit that so I'm

433
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:28,479
sorry so far there's no editing to be

434
00:15:27,129 --> 00:15:30,340
done in this show and I like it I'm

435

on the count of six four five six that's

446
00:16:01,059 --> 00:16:06,879
how we do it we take dads in the middle

447
00:16:04,299 --> 00:16:08,559
of the podcast we used to smoke so much

448
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:09,669
more hash on this show I've been trying

449
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:12,069
to get it a little tighter and not be

450
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:16,240
dad the [ __ ] out it also helps my throat

451
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:17,680
last longer all right so well yeah

452
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,539
that's Anita Hayes from Colorado's best

453
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:21,309
dads and it makes my head [ __ ] spin

454
00:16:19,539 --> 00:16:24,610
it's so great he gets me amped up that

455
00:16:21,309 --> 00:16:26,019
makes me lively hypothetically if I were

456
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:27,490
going to come home on my lunch break and

457
00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:29,079
smoke a bunch of dads and need to go

458
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:31,360
back to work all energized and in the

459
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:33,040
zone hypothetically I would take four

460
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:37,060
dabs of that and I'd be in the [ __ ]

461
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:38,500
zone when I went back to work all right

462
00:16:37,059 --> 00:16:40,119

00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:29,409
next periscope video sometimes I

488
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,030
randomly decide that I want to put the

489
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:32,259
podcast on periscope while I'm doing it

490
00:17:31,029 --> 00:17:33,609
and right now it's kind of cool because

491
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:35,289
I feel like I'm talking to somebody

492
00:17:33,609 --> 00:17:36,339
there's somebody just someone to look at

493
00:17:35,289 --> 00:17:37,930
instead of just staring into the

494
00:17:36,339 --> 00:17:40,000
computer over here I'm looking at my

495
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:42,220

alright the article goes like this a

524
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:43,089
public county commissioner is proposing

525
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,620
a ballot measure for a program to fund

526
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:47,379
college scholarships through a marijuana

527
00:18:44,619 --> 00:18:49,329
excise tax commissioner Sal pace says he

528
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:51,460
hopes the new measure will give webelo

529
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:53,319
kids a boost and help fight college debt

530
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:54,700
the County Commission is set to vote at

531
00:18:53,319 --> 00:18:56,679
their Monday meeting on whether or not

532
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:59,350
the proposal will be placed on November

533
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:01,120
ballot elections the excise tax would be

534
00:18:59,349 --> 00:19:03,939
levied when marijuana is transferred

535
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:06,339
from cultivation to a store paces office

536
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:07,509
said in a news release Wednesday he said

537
00:19:06,339 --> 00:19:10,689
that Wednesday sorry I read that really

538
00:19:07,509 --> 00:19:12,730
weird pueblos counties perfect economic

539
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:14,740
and weather conditions have created a

540
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:16,450
boom of recreational cultivations

541
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:19,960
without yet generating a tax on these

542
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:21,309
grows beginning in 2017 graduating

543
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:23,049
seniors from all high schools and

544
00:19:21,309 --> 00:19:25,509
pueblos who attend a public college or

545
00:19:23,049 --> 00:19:26,980
university in Pueblo County will be

546
00:19:25,509 --> 00:19:29,950
eligible for scholarships from the

547
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:31,599
proposed program that release said every

548
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:33,370
kid deserves an opportunity to succeed

549
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:35,529
they said in a statement

550
00:19:33,369 --> 00:19:37,689
Pablo County has potential new tax

551
00:19:35,529 --> 00:19:39,819
revenue from a marijuana industry that

552
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:42,100
can benefit the kids of pueblos the

553
00:19:39,819 --> 00:19:44,109
ballot measure would propose a 5% excise

554
00:19:42,099 --> 00:19:46,689
tax on recreational marijuana grows from

555
00:19:44,109 --> 00:19:47,469
Pueblo County it asks that on an annual

556
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:50,440
basis

557
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:54,220
no less than 50% of tax revenue be

558
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:56,558
designated for scholarships 50% well if

559
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:58,538
you're doing it for this shouldn't 100

560
00:19:56,558 --> 00:20:01,298
where's the other 50 going Sal where is

561
00:19:58,538 --> 00:20:03,038
the other 50% going okay the rest of the

562
00:20:01,298 --> 00:20:05,079
revenue would be used on community

563
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:07,089
projects like Colorado State Fairs

564
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:09,009
streetscape refurbishment medical

565
00:20:07,089 --> 00:20:11,139
marijuana academic research and a

566
00:20:09,009 --> 00:20:14,019
feasibility study on the potential

567
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:17,320
connection of Amtrak south on track

568
00:20:14,019 --> 00:20:20,319
Southwest Chief to Pueblo and those all

569
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:21,970
sound like feasible options those seem

570
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:23,740
like they're worth some investment the

571
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:25,450
program may be expanded in future years

572
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:27,759
depending on revenue that really said

573
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:29,259
Tyler Hinson president president of the

574
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:31,000
Colorado cannabis Chamber of Commerce

575
00:20:29,259 --> 00:20:32,679
said he hopes the chin the County

576
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,960
Commission will fully examine the

577
00:20:32,679 --> 00:20:37,059
measure before sending it to the ballot

578
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,950
under amendment 64 we gave local

579
00:20:37,058 --> 00:20:41,558
governments two permission to make these

580
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:43,419
excise taxes he said I would just

581
00:20:41,558 --> 00:20:45,399
caution the county commissioners to look

582
00:20:43,419 --> 00:20:48,009
at how this will affect sales in Pueblo

583
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:49,509
and be surrounding areas that's the

584
00:20:48,009 --> 00:20:52,480
first thing I think of they're gonna add

585
00:20:49,509 --> 00:20:55,058
5% more tax the tax is already really

586
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,950
high in Pueblo it's approximately 25

587
00:20:55,058 --> 00:20:58,690
percent I don't know the exact

588
00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:01,120
percentage to tell you the truth guys if

589
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:02,470
anybody on periscope maybe an emo Punk

590
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:04,418
if you want to throw up the actual

591
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:06,279
percentage of tax I'll say that on the

592
00:21:04,419 --> 00:21:07,600
air and I'll give you a shout-out also

593
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:10,538
make sure you guys follow my friend Nemo

594
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:12,788
Punk 15 on Twitter he posts a lot of

595
00:21:10,538 --> 00:21:15,669
great cannabis [ __ ] seventeen and a half

596
00:21:12,788 --> 00:21:18,220
percent plus the ten percent excise tax

597
00:21:15,669 --> 00:21:19,690
that already exists so that's 27 percent

598
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:22,058
plus they're going to add another five

599
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:24,548
which will make it 32 percent excise tax

600
00:21:22,058 --> 00:21:26,079
so this extra excise tax is just gonna

601
00:21:24,548 --> 00:21:28,179
end up falling on the customer in the

602
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:30,548
end no matter how it works which is

603
00:21:28,179 --> 00:21:33,788
going to make cannabis tax 32 percent

604
00:21:30,548 --> 00:21:36,400
here in Pueblo which means it's gonna be

605
00:21:33,788 --> 00:21:38,109
roughly 185 dollars for a quarter of

606
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,970
cannabis which is ridiculous when you

607
00:21:38,109 --> 00:21:42,399
can go to the street and you can get

608
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:45,009
probably you can get an ounce for that

609
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,630
price on the street you can get an ounce

610
00:21:45,009 --> 00:21:48,099
for $200 you can get outs for one

611
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:49,780
hundred and fifty dollars on the street

612
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:51,609
in Pueblo Colorado so this is going to

613
00:21:49,779 --> 00:21:52,480
turn around and put everybody back at

614
00:21:51,609 --> 00:21:54,519
the black-market

615
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,740
they're just gonna ruin it they're

616
00:21:54,519 --> 00:21:58,179
trying to squeeze too much blood out of

617
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:59,500
one turnip i think is what my grandma

618
00:21:58,179 --> 00:22:00,280
used to said trying to squeeze blood out

619
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:02,079
of a turnip

620
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:03,309
I think I think that's what these guys

621
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:05,710
are trying to do and they're gonna crash

622
00:22:03,309 --> 00:22:06,940
the whole marijuana thing alright guys I

623
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:08,590
