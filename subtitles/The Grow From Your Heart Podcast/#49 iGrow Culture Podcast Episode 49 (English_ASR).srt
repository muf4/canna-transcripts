95
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:30,000
evolution in myself guys if my voice

96
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,640
changed I honestly just stuck a lot of

97
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
toilet paper in my nose to keep my nose

98
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:34,598
from freaking running cuz it's dripping

99
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,360
and it's disgusting so if I sound weird

100
00:03:34,598 --> 00:03:38,438
that's why it's not puberty issues it's

101
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,599
not me

102
00:03:38,438 --> 00:03:42,239
cracking but no it was fun I got I felt

103
00:03:40,598 --> 00:03:44,199
the evolution cuz those earlier shows

104
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,759
when it was me on the mic by myself it

105
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:47,158
felt like I was reading it like this

106
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:49,039
podcast is brought to you by Nature's

107
00:03:47,158 --> 00:03:50,919

108
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:52,840
they did get a little last couple

109
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:54,119
episodes I flipped the papers over that

110
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,878
I had on the desk and just started

111
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,680
talking I was like [ __ ] all the notes

112
00:03:55,878 --> 00:03:59,919
this is what I want to say and it's fun

113
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,200
it's fun to kind of put it was way more

114
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:04,039
comfortable like it was it was good man

115
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:06,238
I didn't too much at the beginning know

116
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:07,280
how to put nobody cared about me like I

117
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,438
I didn't want to come out and be like

118
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,438
this is me and my podcast you now I feel

119
00:04:09,438 --> 00:04:12,199
like I made friends with all my

120
00:04:10,438 --> 00:04:14,560
listeners so they do kind of kind of

121
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:15,839
care interacting so yeah so we're saying

122
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,959
that Adams found his wheelhouse this

123
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,879
kid's a framer he swings a hammer and

124
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:22,240
Frames like a chant kind of who would

125
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:23,918
have known yeah I've done it for a while

126
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,400
man I mean just it I've had

127
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:26,879
opportunities offered to me like let's

128
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:29,959
go start a business and it's like dude

129
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:31,680
you don't I have problems you know and

130
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:34,399
at this table a lot of these people kind

131
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,400
of understand those problems so you know

132
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:38,079
it's it's that Stoner kind of mentality

133
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:41,959
where you know do you not play well with

134
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:44,120
others on some lines I I may not but who

135
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:46,519
doesn't it's a job site it's not [ __ ]

136
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:48,038
it's not an office you know like you go

137
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:50,519
off and cool off for 20 minutes there's

138
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:52,279
always back one guy at work every day

139
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:53,879
that one person has a problem and that

140
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:55,839
one guy's got to stick up his ass and it

141
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:58,079
seems to rotate that's just how job

142
00:04:55,839 --> 00:05:01,119
sites are we're doing construction and

143
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:04,240
unheated sometimes poorly or unlit

144
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:06,759
warehouses so I mean tempers can flare

145
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:10,199
quickly but I we've got the team pretty

146
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:12,360
chilled out and like okay go take a 20

147
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:15,280
chill yourself out break is pretty

148
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:17,038
standard nice we've learned to to swing

149
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:21,079
it correctly no tools go flying at each

150
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:22,318
other we have fun regularly anymore yeah

151
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:23,879
so there's a that that's part of the

152
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:25,960
reason why I don't do construction uh

153
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:27,839
I'd rather just be a lone wolf growing

154
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:29,120
so I kind of sometimes I'm like man

155
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:30,478
these guys are having fun all day I want

156
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,720
to go to work somewhere with them and

157
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:35,719
then I'm like n or I

158
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,160
just maybe one day but as you know as

159
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,919
for me I got to get I got to get some

160
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:41,560
money set up before I Lone Wolf brow uh

161
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:43,918
it's Tuesday night as we record I

377
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:46,919
the same product so it says remember

378
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:50,000

uh quite singular user instructions in

381
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:58,399

Floria in California he says we never

454
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,560
could have imagined the impact it's

455
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,039
having on the patient community in

456
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:31,039
California and how it spanned the

457
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:32,919
spectrum of users from younger women who

458
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:34,519

sexuality Gerson said there are a large

463
00:15:41,078 --> 00:15:44,719
number of women who could benefit from

464
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:47,039
Cannabis but who aren't interested in

465
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,079
the psychoactive component the product's

466
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:51,000
expansion into Colorado is only the

467
00:15:49,078 --> 00:15:52,958
beginning Gerson estimates Floria will

468
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,519
be available in Washington state pot

469
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:57,239

perfume just like here you go I think

474
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:06,078
it' be funny to get you a bottle and

475
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:08,679

476

480
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:22,480
U I don't know I know a guy that claims

481
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:24,399
he made a Lube using coconut oil and

482
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,879
cannabis and he says when he uses it on

483
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:29,679
chicks that they definitely enjoy it a

484
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:30,919
lot more than when he doesn't use it um

485
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:32,479
I just wanted to I thought it would be

486
00:16:30,919 --> 00:16:34,318
fun to read this with four Dudes at the

487
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:37,000
table I also like cannabis a lot more

488
00:16:34,318 --> 00:16:40,719
when I use it prior than when I don't

489
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:43,440
use it the article was awesome it just

490
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:46,680
[ __ ] full of puns and [ __ ] yeah yeah

491
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:49,759
it was I've heard a lot of placebo

492
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:53,120
warnings about this you know where as in

493
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:54,919
it's I paid $80 for it yeah something

494
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,679
better tingle well if if she's going to

495
00:16:54,919 --> 00:16:58,479
if she's Sprint it on her CL in inner

496
00:16:56,679 --> 00:17:00,318
and outer labia it's working it's

497
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,399
already moistening [ __ ] up and that's

498
00:17:00,318 --> 00:17:04,519
waking it up a little so even if it

499
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:07,640
doesn't work but have you ever eaten

500
00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:09,000
like tinure or um I guess it's just

501
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:11,360
tincture that does it but you get warm

502
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,798
inside like you feel warm and fuzzy I

503
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:14,159
can just imagine spending some tincture

504
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:16,359
on my junk though letting it get all

505
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:19,279
sticky and gross that's what I felt that

506
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:21,038
night from that uh Mountain bar you know

507
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:23,439
that's that's the whole feeling that I

508
00:17:21,038 --> 00:17:25,759
really got did you did you the mountain

509
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:28,319
bar on your junk though oh no I'll try

510
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:32,319
that next time that'll be $12 well spent

511
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:36,279
I'll tell you right now I think 350 Mig

512
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:39,319
back to THC right to my tank yeah I'm

513
00:17:36,279 --> 00:17:42,399
down I refrained myself from using taint

514
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:44,639
earlier the show just got really really

515
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,200
weird don't worry I've done ruin that

516
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,919
for you so I know a product that

517
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:51,038
definitely does work that apana pain

518
00:17:48,919 --> 00:17:54,038
relief cream yeah with the Juniper

519
00:17:51,038 --> 00:17:55,480
arnica cannabis stuff dude uh I didn't

520
00:17:54,038 --> 00:17:57,720
believe in it to tell you the truth to

521
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:59,319
definitely I was skeptical about it

522
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,200
because I'm a PO I think you got to

523
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:02,918
smoke weed to or consume cannabis

524
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,798
somehow to get high right but my

525
00:18:02,919 --> 00:18:07,720
girlfriend uh actually the Grammy Gatsby

526
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:09,158
gave me a bottle of that uh apana and I

527
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:12,440
rubbed my girlfriend down with it for

528
00:18:09,159 --> 00:18:14,440
like an hour and a half one night and my

529
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:16,640
uh to quote Pink Floyd my hands felt

530
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:18,120
just like two balloons they F I felt

531
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,679
like I had Mickey Mouse gloves on I was

532
00:18:18,119 --> 00:18:22,558
like wo my hands are big like they felt

533
00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:24,720
all like fluffy and bigger than they

534
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:26,519
were dream or something yeah kind of

535
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,798
yeah like I'd go to like scratch my face

536
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:29,440
and punch myself in the head a little

537
00:18:27,798 --> 00:18:31,000
bit cuz my fingers were

538
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,759
there already I was like what is this is

539
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,400
weird it's like I had boxing gloves on

540
00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:37,400
my mom used that and U she said she got

541
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:39,360
high [ __ ] from it it's got to know about

542
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:41,679
getting highest [ __ ] from it but I

543
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:43,839
definitely felt my mom's a very small

544
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:45,559
smoker though okay maybe she did it

545
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:48,439
definitely helps uh I start off the

546
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:50,240
massage with just coconut oil to kind of

547
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:52,200
uh start a massage to get her loosened

548
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,240
up and get her lubed I didn't I tried to

549
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,038
avoid the word Lube cuz if I use that

550
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,440
apana right away it absorbs in too

551
00:18:56,038 --> 00:18:59,000
quickly and I don't think it spreads

552
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,919
enough so I get her coconut oil and then

553
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,558
I put the Apotheca in there definitely I

554
00:19:00,919 --> 00:19:04,480
can tell that she can I can see that she

555
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:07,240
loosens up as soon as that apoa starts

556
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,798
getting in there it's that's why I had

557
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:11,798
to use that word there was just nothing

558
00:19:08,798 --> 00:19:13,798
else that to describe it see he knew he

559
00:19:11,798 --> 00:19:14,960
gets it he didn't want to use Loop but I

560
00:19:13,798 --> 00:19:16,240
didn't want to use the word Lube but

561
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,440
sometimes you got to take that jump and

562
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,480
say words that you're trying to avoid uh

563
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:22,120
a lot of people don't like the word

564
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:24,159
moist I've noticed moist like really

565
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:27,119
bothers it's the way some people say it

566
00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:30,640
moist moist moist like a a

567
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:33,000
properly uh us that spray like you've

568
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,200
been using that cannabis spray maybe all

569
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,400
right we're going to try to put this

570
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:39,080
show back on track um here's another

571
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,480
article from the Cannabis this Cent can

572
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:42,918
see I'm so [ __ ] lost I can't even

573
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:45,880
talk I still got this Kleenex in my nose

574
00:19:42,919 --> 00:19:47,960
too face stamp on uh this article is

575
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:49,600
written by John ingled and Jordan Stefan

576
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:51,720
from The Denver Post the headline is

577
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:53,678
hash oil legality now questioned for

578
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:55,360
Colorado courts and then the sub

579
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:57,880
headline is by the end of Wednesday

580
00:19:55,359 --> 00:19:59,639
hearing Denver district court judge a

581
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:01,559
Bruce Jones had concluded both sides

582
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:04,000
were wrong though it was still unclear

583
00:20:01,558 --> 00:20:06,918
how he would ultimately rule um side

584
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,599
note this dude's name is a Bruce Jones

585
00:20:06,919 --> 00:20:11,480
are you a bad [ __ ] if your first

586
00:20:08,599 --> 00:20:13,439
name is just an initial like it's

587
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:15,839
actually a type of graphical error let

588
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:18,880
led to me be called or LED me being

589
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:20,720
called D for like two and a half years

590
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:24,080
during public

591
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:27,000
school that's frustrating yeah this dude

592
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:28,678
chose to do it he's a Bruce Jones he

593
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,480
chose to do it or his parents just

594
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:31,840
Tagged so I guess if I wanted to be a

595
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,038
poet or something my middle name is

596
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:35,119
Scott so I'd be Jay Scott then my last

597
00:20:34,038 --> 00:20:37,240
name I almost said it on the show but I

598
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:40,000
ain't going to do that but it be J J

599
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:41,720
Scott Rasta like if you wanted to go

600
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,119
that way you don't have to change your

601
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:45,640
name become a poet you just be you that

602
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:47,678
really sophisticated is that what he's

603
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:51,400
trying to do or or is his first name

604
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:54,080
just like 17 letters and starts with a

605
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:56,240
[ __ ] up on now it's so funny their

606
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:59,599
little nickname for me at work and [ __ ]

607

is what I used to get teased as as like

608
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:03,558

609
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:06,038
you know like when you're a kid and they

610

655
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:49,400
hash around you know town and stuff so I

656

669
00:23:19,038 --> 00:23:22,919
moment but it was great and will

670

698
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,558
a couple of fat dabs if that tells you

699
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,320
anything about how I felt today been

700
00:24:24,558 --> 00:24:27,960
trying to get hydrated dude it's so hard

701
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:30,278
to get hydrated once you're dehydrated

702
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:32,679
being don't drink that then don't drink

703
00:24:30,278 --> 00:24:35,200
this yeah the the bong water water

704
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:36,399

00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:43,639
danger danger there's probably like a

709
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,679
good gram of reclaim just floating on

710
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,799
top of that [ __ ] that would have been

711
00:24:44,679 --> 00:24:49,360
the worst drink ever anybody out there

712
00:24:46,798 --> 00:24:51,839

00:28:09,079 --> 00:28:13,759
I I think it's just coming out of the

805
00:28:11,319 --> 00:28:15,319
carb cap honestly uh probably is the

806
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:16,919
carb cap now that you say that

807
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:20,599

can suck through it it's cool so but

829
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:13,359

834
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:25,120
gross yeah yeah that doesn't sound nasty

835
00:29:23,278 --> 00:29:26,519
all right all this BHO talk leads me

836
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:28,798
right into this news article that I was

837
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:30,519
attempting to read so that's perfect

838
00:29:28,798 --> 00:29:31,720
um yeah you're going to hear a couple of

839
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:34,079
weird breaths from me I can feel my nose

840
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:36,079

legal status of marijuana hash oil in

843
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:41,839
post legislation Colorado resulted in

844
00:29:40,359 --> 00:29:44,240
the judge turning up his hands and

845
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:45,558
shrugging his shoulders an exasperation

846
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,880
Mike's pulling out his phone to take a

847
00:29:45,558 --> 00:29:48,480
picture of me because I got this big

848
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:51,039
water of toilet paper stuffed in my nose

849
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,720
while I'm doing a podcast I wasn't but

850
00:29:51,038 --> 00:29:56,119
now I'm

851
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:58,159
gonna the nasal tampon uh the hearing in

852
00:29:56,119 --> 00:30:01,278
Denver District Court uh was to decide

853
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:02,278
whether a man named Paul Manion Manion

854
00:30:01,278 --> 00:30:04,679
Manny

855
00:30:02,278 --> 00:30:06,038
manoni if this guy Paul who was one of

856
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:07,480
the three people charged after an

857
00:30:06,038 --> 00:30:09,038
explosion at a Southwest Denver

858
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:10,720
Warehouse can be prosecuted for the

859
00:30:09,038 --> 00:30:13,240
crime of manufacturing marijuana

860
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:15,000
concentrate the man's attorney Rob Cory

861
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:17,919
who helped write Colorado's marijuana

862
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,519
leg legalization law said Manion can't

863
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:21,519
be charged because of Colorado's

864
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:22,839
Constitution now protects the personal

865
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:25,599
possession of marijuana and the

866
00:30:22,839 --> 00:30:27,599
processing of marijuana plants the court

867
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:29,798
system is not to be used for marijuana

868
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:30,879
regul anymore Cory said I wish he would

869
00:30:29,798 --> 00:30:32,839
have said cannabis it would have made it

870
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:35,240
a lot better uh the Colorado attorney

871
00:30:32,839 --> 00:30:37,639
general argues Manion can be charged

872
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:40,240
because by virtue of a curiously placed

873
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:42,200
comma in amendment 64 the legalization

874
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:45,319
measure the protection for marijuana

875
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:48,159
does not cover cannabis oil like hash

876
00:30:45,319 --> 00:30:50,158
oil the measure says its definition for

877
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:52,399
marijuana does not include Industrial

878
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:55,278
Hemp nor does it include fiber produced

879
00:30:52,398 --> 00:30:57,479
from the stocks oil or cake made from

880
00:30:55,278 --> 00:30:59,079
the seeds of the plant uh the Attorney

881
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:01,360
General's office which weighed in on

882
00:30:59,079 --> 00:31:03,158
manion's case even though it is not

883
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:06,079
Prosecuting the case has made a similar

884
00:31:03,159 --> 00:31:07,639
argument in a case in Mesa County by the

885
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:10,519
end of Wednesday's hearing Denver

886
00:31:07,638 --> 00:31:12,359
District Judge uh a Bruce Jones had

887
00:31:10,519 --> 00:31:13,960
concluded both sides were wrong though

888
00:31:12,359 --> 00:31:16,439
it was still unclear how he would

889
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:18,600
ultimately rule uh Janes said he plans

890
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:20,360
to deny Cory's motion to drop the charge

891
00:31:18,599 --> 00:31:23,038
meaning the case against Manion can

892
00:31:20,359 --> 00:31:24,638
proceed and here's kind of we're getting

893
00:31:23,038 --> 00:31:27,359
into the part where it's all technical

894
00:31:24,638 --> 00:31:29,278
hash oil is a uh potent goop left over

895
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:31,319
after Mar an's active chemicals are

896
00:31:29,278 --> 00:31:34,200
dissolved from the underlying plant

897
00:31:31,319 --> 00:31:38,079
material oh that guy tried real hard he

898
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:41,159
tried hard yeah uh it's the Nast stuff

899
00:31:38,079 --> 00:31:44,119
yeah hash oil is the hash that we want

900
00:31:41,159 --> 00:31:47,278
that's everyone involved in this story

901
00:31:44,119 --> 00:31:49,959
and this article is it best trying hard

902
00:31:47,278 --> 00:31:51,638
nobody succeeded yeah the Cannabis often

903
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:53,840
tries really hard but they need somebody

904
00:31:51,638 --> 00:31:56,479
they need a a guy like you

905
00:31:53,839 --> 00:31:58,240
Mike do too you should contact the

906
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:00,038
Cannabis and be like hey you guys a lot

907
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:01,919
of dumb [ __ ] like you they tell their

908
00:32:00,038 --> 00:32:04,000
stories right nothing is inaccurate here

909
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:06,639
except the wording hash oil is the

910
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,079
potent goop left over after marijuana's

911
00:32:06,638 --> 00:32:11,798
active chemicals are dissolved oil I

912
00:32:09,079 --> 00:32:14,960
mean well the oil that the oil the

913
00:32:11,798 --> 00:32:17,000
sentence in question in the bill is

914
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,558
about hemp seed oil if you take hemp

915
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,480
seed and you gather it up and you press

916
00:32:18,558 --> 00:32:23,480
it sort of like you do grapes to make

917
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:26,319
wine you get an oil that you can make

918
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:28,960
everything you can make with oil oil

919
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:30,480
like Texans haul out of the ground oil

920
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:33,519
and that's what they're referencing in

921
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:37,360
that part of the bill hash oil isn't oil

922
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:39,399
oil or cannabis oil we just call it oil

923
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:42,678
because it kind of looks like yeah it's

924
00:32:39,398 --> 00:32:44,558
honey oil when it comes out yeah honey

925
00:32:42,679 --> 00:32:46,639
so they're being sck about a

926
00:32:44,558 --> 00:32:48,278
technicality I love watching it drip out

927
00:32:46,638 --> 00:32:51,119
of the end of the over a descriptive

928
00:32:48,278 --> 00:32:54,440
slang term yeah that's cuz that's what I

929
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:56,398
keep thinking I'm like it's not I even

930
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:57,960
and the judge isn't going to drop the

931
00:32:56,398 --> 00:32:59,439
case because I'm pretty sure this [ __ ]

932
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,639
not blew up his house yeah there's more

933
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,639
to the story let me read part of that

934
00:33:00,638 --> 00:33:04,599
and then we'll this part blowing up your

935
00:33:02,638 --> 00:33:06,719
house has long been a crime in Colorado

936
00:33:04,599 --> 00:33:08,398
that was not legalized at anytime

937
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,720
recently and that's something that Rob

938
00:33:08,398 --> 00:33:11,638
Cory mentions and I'm going to have an

939
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:13,240
argument later on in the story and I

940
00:33:11,638 --> 00:33:14,839
think you agree with me now no I like it

941
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:16,480
I like Forward Thinking people that's

942
00:33:14,839 --> 00:33:18,319
awesome uh we don't have to sit in the

943
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:20,480
backseat of our minds and [ __ ] let

944
00:33:18,319 --> 00:33:22,480
everybody else drive us think forward uh

945
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:24,079
so hash oil they describe it wrong and

946
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:26,000
then it says a popular amateur

947
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:27,759
production method uses compressed butane

948
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,038
gas which can lead to dangerous explos

949
00:33:27,759 --> 00:33:32,599
ions like the one that rocked the 1200

950
00:33:30,038 --> 00:33:35,000
Block of South liin Street last April

951
00:33:32,599 --> 00:33:37,000
Manion is also charged with arson in

952
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,119
connection with that blast during

953
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,558
Wednesday's hearing Cory argued that

954
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:44,199
home hash oil explosions are mistakes

955
00:33:41,558 --> 00:33:47,079
but not illegal uh I compare it to

956
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:49,399
frying a turkey Corey said accidents

957
00:33:47,079 --> 00:33:50,918
don't mean a crime has occurred Jones

958
00:33:49,398 --> 00:33:53,439
didn't seem impressed calling some of

959
00:33:50,919 --> 00:33:55,200
Cory's arguments circular but Jones also

960
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:57,360
criticized an attorney general's

961
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,840
position I'm going to tell him he's

962
00:33:57,359 --> 00:34:02,319
wrong I'm going to tell him he's way

963
00:33:58,839 --> 00:34:04,240
wrong Jones said so he compared it to if

964
00:34:02,319 --> 00:34:07,519
I'm cooking a chicken and I burn the

965
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:10,159
apartment building down or a turkey then

966

00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:13,119
still recklessly endangering people and

968
00:34:11,878 --> 00:34:15,358
I think charges are going to be pressed

969
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:16,919
on me even if I do burn down my

970

don't know it depend a lot of that

989
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,400
depends on where you are at the time and

990
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:01,000
not Mike's not a lawyer he just stated a

991
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:04,519
holiday and express last night that part

992
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:06,559
of Cory's argument here is correct but

993
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:08,719
uh the part it does that doesn't apply

994
00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:11,159
to to butane hash oil it's you're

995
00:35:08,719 --> 00:35:13,239
venting cans of flammable gas into an

996
00:35:11,159 --> 00:35:15,960
enclosed space which is actually an OSHA

997
00:35:13,239 --> 00:35:18,559
crime I think some special that's a

998
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:20,679
special thing in the fire code for sure

999
00:35:18,559 --> 00:35:23,559
when uh when I asked the fire chief down

1000
00:35:20,679 --> 00:35:27,000
here cuz peblo outlawed uh making a a

1001
00:35:23,559 --> 00:35:29,480
BHO a while ago and when the vote passed

1002
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,039
I right after the it passed I stood up

1003
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:33,599
and walked back to the fire chief and

1004
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:34,838
jokingly asked venting cans of butane

1005
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:37,039
into your living room and lighting a

1006
00:35:34,838 --> 00:35:38,880
match has been illegal for how long and

1007
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:41,960
he chuckled and went longer than I've

1008
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:44,000
been on the job I mean CU that's a thing

1009
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:46,320
you can't dump gasoline around your

1010
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,239
apartment and light a match and if

1011
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:50,160
you're venting cans of butane inside

1012
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:51,838
you're venting cans of flammable gas

1013
00:35:50,159 --> 00:35:53,759
into an enclosed space if your pilot

1014
00:35:51,838 --> 00:35:55,920
light kicks on your eyebrows are kicking

1015
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:58,520
off all your windows are kicking out and

1016
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:00,838
you're going to the burn unit yeah the

1017
00:35:58,519 --> 00:36:03,880
burn and not the good Burn Unit but

1018
00:36:00,838 --> 00:36:05,318
there's not a special charge for well

1019
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:07,000
yeah there used to be a place we called

1020
00:36:05,318 --> 00:36:10,639
the burn units where we used to go burn

1021
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,639
some kind of endanger

1022
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:16,440
endang I heard a dub band once called

1023
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:17,920
Burn Unit yeah so yeah all right so

1024
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:19,280
sheltered I'm going to finish the

1025
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,680
article caught almost on the sidelines

1026
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,280
was the Denver District Attorney's

1027
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:23,919
office which is actually Prosecuting the

1028
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:26,319
case a deputy district attorney said the

1029
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,599
hash oil qualifies as pot but he said

1030
00:36:26,318 --> 00:36:29,318
there's a difference between Amendment

1031
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:30,720
64 is protection for processing

1032
00:36:29,318 --> 00:36:32,279
marijuana and the state laws for

1033
00:36:30,719 --> 00:36:34,799
criminalizing of manufacturing

1034
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:37,040
concentrated marijuana Jones is expected

1035
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:39,400
to issue his ruling in the coming weeks

1036
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:41,639
so they're saying that uh there's major

1037
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:44,480
difference between processing which is

1038
00:36:41,639 --> 00:36:47,759
properly doing that [ __ ] in a facility

1039
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:50,599
uh in a tested authorized me approved

1040
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:52,599
lab uh that's also been State regulated

1041
00:36:50,599 --> 00:36:54,039
by the health department and like

1042
00:36:52,599 --> 00:36:55,119
there's like seven different agencies

1043
00:36:54,039 --> 00:36:56,639
that want to come in and inspect your

1044
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:59,838
[ __ ] if you're growing and making

1045
00:36:56,639 --> 00:37:01,519
concentrates uh and then manufacturing

1046
00:36:59,838 --> 00:37:03,639
concentrated marijuana he was doing that

1047
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:05,199
at his house open blasting so that I

1048
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:09,318
think that's where the where the change

1049
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:11,879
happens right yeah so I guess the point

1050
00:37:09,318 --> 00:37:13,679
is don't [ __ ] blast indoors don't

1051
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:15,358
open blast if you're going to blast get

1052
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:17,519
a closed loop and you can still [ __ ] up

1053
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:20,039
do that safely there's yet to be a news

1054
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:21,880
story about someone hurting themselves

1055
00:37:20,039 --> 00:37:24,358
uh making BHO

1056
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:25,880
outside those news stories don't happen

1057
00:37:24,358 --> 00:37:27,639
because people don't get hurt that way

1058
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:30,200
that's kind of a good point just takeing

1059
00:37:27,639 --> 00:37:32,199
your backyard numbnuts everyone I know

1060
00:37:30,199 --> 00:37:33,199
that's never blown themselves up does it

1061
00:37:32,199 --> 00:37:36,078
that

1062
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:37,159
way yeah yep it's the hell of a way to

1063
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:40,240
look it's one of those things where it's

1064
00:37:37,159 --> 00:37:43,078
not complicated I was taught how to make

1065
00:37:40,239 --> 00:37:44,519
uh my extracts Outdoors it's pretty much

1066
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:45,960
I knew that already but they're like you

1067
00:37:44,519 --> 00:37:48,318
always do this outside was the first

1068
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:50,039
thing they said step one check the

1069
00:37:48,318 --> 00:37:52,400
weather all right I don't think there's

1070
00:37:50,039 --> 00:37:54,119
any other news that we should talk about

1071
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:56,480

1072

1074
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:04,200

1075
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:06,440
PUO that's funny this is one of the

1076
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:09,480

1086
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:30,439

1087

1089
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:36,760
they're mostly closed up I lived in a

1090
00:38:35,039 --> 00:38:38,599
house those are different tunel those

1091
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:40,440
are different tunnels I lived in a house

1092
00:38:38,599 --> 00:38:42,079
in an area I don't even know if I should

1093
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:43,358
talk about this there's a part of town

1094
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:45,720
called Goat

1095
00:38:43,358 --> 00:38:46,920
Hill many years ago I don't remember the

1096
00:38:45,719 --> 00:38:48,519
exact year so I don't want to be wrong

1097
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:50,280
and try to say I have an idea in my head

1098
00:38:48,519 --> 00:38:51,960
but many years ago this town flooded up

1099
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:54,960
to like the third story window of a lot

1100
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:56,639
of buildings downtown 1916 I think it

1101
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:59,159
could have been I'll agree with you that

1102
00:38:56,639 --> 00:39:01,960
way Jesse can be wrong 29 but I really

1103
00:38:59,159 --> 00:39:03,960
have no idea so a long time ago uh when

1104
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:06,559
the pictures were yellow when they took

1105
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:09,039
pictures everything 44 that's about it

1106
00:39:06,559 --> 00:39:11,880
could have been so but this town flooded

1107
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:13,679
there's a hill uh near uh it used to be

1108
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:15,680
first street now it's [ __ ] Center

1109
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:17,239
Center City drive or some dumb sh City

1110
00:39:15,679 --> 00:39:19,358
Center Drive that's so dumb it's First

1111
00:39:17,239 --> 00:39:21,039
Street [ __ ] why' you change that so

1112
00:39:19,358 --> 00:39:23,400
right up there there was a hill and it

1113
00:39:21,039 --> 00:39:26,039
was called Goat Hill and that's where

1114
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:27,760
allegedly all of the Italians that lived

1115
00:39:26,039 --> 00:39:29,480
here went and moved to that top of the

1116
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,960
hill and took all their livestock there

1117
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:33,318
and they had goats up there and that

1118
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:36,480
part of town became known as Goat Hill

1119
00:39:33,318 --> 00:39:39,400
uh in my house I had a hatch that lifted

1120
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,719
up in my bedroom like and you could lift

1121
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,800
up that and you'd end up in a hidden

1122
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:44,679
Basement part and then there was

1123
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:47,480
definitely a hole that had been bricked

1124
00:39:44,679 --> 00:39:49,519
over and I'm pretty sure that that hole

1125
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:52,159
was part of those tunnels and then I was

1126
00:39:49,519 --> 00:39:54,880
in a band that did a show at the Damon

1127
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:57,159
runion theater downtown which used to be

1128
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:58,559
the chief and if you go to one of the

1129
00:39:57,159 --> 00:40:00,358
little back area is by the kitchen

1130
00:39:58,559 --> 00:40:01,719
there's a tunnel that's blocked off and

1131
00:40:00,358 --> 00:40:03,639
the security guard wouldn't let me go

1132
00:40:01,719 --> 00:40:05,078
past that area cuz I was just in the

1133
00:40:03,639 --> 00:40:06,519
opening band and he's like you can't go

1134
00:40:05,079 --> 00:40:08,318
back here I was like I'm in the Band

1135
00:40:06,519 --> 00:40:10,679
he's like you can't go back here like

1136
00:40:08,318 --> 00:40:12,159
all right I tried so there uh those

1137
00:40:10,679 --> 00:40:14,000
tunnels used to be used I bet that

1138
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:17,358
tunnel in the tunnel I found connect

1139
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,679
somewhere somehow like probably this and

1140
00:40:17,358 --> 00:40:21,519
the hooch was made at the top of the

1141
00:40:18,679 --> 00:40:23,838
hill up on Goat Hill and then it was ran

1142
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:26,400
and money probably like if you want to

1143
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:29,838
know why peblo has people in it you can

1144
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:31,519
watch two documentaries on or on Netflix

1145

1150
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:44,039

1180
00:41:46,159 --> 00:41:50,159
around all day I did get a little bit of

1181
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,880
work done I put uh I've been talking

1182
00:41:50,159 --> 00:41:52,920
about the black cherry chem feno hunt

1183
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:55,800
that I'm doing I don't know how much I

1184
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:58,599
talk about it on the show I sprouted uh

1185
00:41:55,800 --> 00:42:00,039
I sprouted 40 seeds and 35 of them made

1186
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:02,400
it to the flower room which is actually

1187
00:42:00,039 --> 00:42:03,800
pretty impressive uh when that many of

1188
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:06,880
them make it all the way to flower that

1189
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:08,240
means that there were five like uh maybe

1190
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:10,079
I don't I don't remember exactly but

1191
00:42:08,239 --> 00:42:11,879
some didn't germinate some were runts

1192
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:14,359
and then some I just didn't feel like

1193
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:16,640
they were worth the space so 35 of them

1194
00:42:14,358 --> 00:42:19,558
made it to flower today I moved 11 of

1195
00:42:16,639 --> 00:42:22,358
them into another room uh because they

1196
00:42:19,559 --> 00:42:24,400
are males my goal is to find a purple

1197
00:42:22,358 --> 00:42:25,598
male and a green male hopefully the

1198
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,519
light went off I got to go check that it

1199
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:28,240
was supposed to go off at 9:00 they're

1200
00:42:26,519 --> 00:42:30,358
in a new room the got started tonight

we'll see how that worked yeah uh

1202
00:42:30,358 --> 00:42:33,880
hopefully I find a purple male and a

1203
00:42:31,719 --> 00:42:36,279
green male and hopefully I find a purple

1204
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:38,838
female and a green female and I'm going

1205
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:42,559
to kind of collect pollen and sort of

1206
00:42:38,838 --> 00:42:45,199
cube things and see if I can't make F uh

1207

hard to I've been wanting seeds since

1412
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:01,799
I've been here and I've just never had

1413
00:49:59,838 --> 00:50:02,960
money at the time you know he's like

1414

table full seeds he's like so which ones

1416
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:08,480
do you want I'm like uh the the the ones

1417
00:50:07,358 --> 00:50:10,880
that you're throwing away over there

1418
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:12,679
would be cool you know the pale ones the

1419
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:14,640
runs yeah maybe I'll get one of those to

1420
00:50:12,679 --> 00:50:16,440
sprout but timing everything is kind of

1421
00:50:14,639 --> 00:50:17,519
a pain in the like we know how to do it

1422
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:20,400
we've done it enough but getting your

1423
00:50:17,519 --> 00:50:22,119
mail started and then if I put three or

1424
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:24,200
four four or five females in the room

1425
00:50:22,119 --> 00:50:26,838
with that male sometimes they have to go

1426
00:50:24,199 --> 00:50:28,399
into flower four or five six or seven

1427
00:50:26,838 --> 00:50:30,199
eight or 10 days apart from each other

1428
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:32,920
to time up when the females are

1429
00:50:30,199 --> 00:50:35,159
ovulating to take that pollen for sure

1430
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:38,119
and different males dump it different

1431
00:50:35,159 --> 00:50:40,039
time honestly what I did I'll admit this

1432
00:50:38,119 --> 00:50:42,480
I make my own silver tho sulfate and I

1433
00:50:40,039 --> 00:50:45,000
tried a new method and I over applied

1434
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:47,240
and my male plants turned male super

1435
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,440
quick uh quicker than I've ever seen but

1436
00:50:47,239 --> 00:50:51,759
at the same time they didn't make any

1437
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:53,318
pollen they made some but not nearly as

1438
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:55,440
much as I had anticipated not what I'm

1439
00:50:53,318 --> 00:50:57,000
used to so I got about a quarter amount

1440
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:58,400
of the seeds I expected tell you the

1441
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,798
truth I'm manad enough to say that on

1442
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:02,318
the show I done [ __ ] up y'all but I

1443
00:51:00,798 --> 00:51:05,440
learned from it I know not to do that

1444
00:51:02,318 --> 00:51:07,798
again real life mistakes and that's a a

1445
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:10,440
high level mistake too so if you're

1446
00:51:07,798 --> 00:51:12,199
making that you know you know don't

1447
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:13,519
don't yeah yeah I'm not even I don't

1448
00:51:12,199 --> 00:51:15,239
think you're beating yourself up no I

1449
00:51:13,519 --> 00:51:17,639
know not to do that I I over reped I

1450
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:19,279
sprayed too many times and uh I made it

1451
00:51:17,639 --> 00:51:21,199
too strong and sprayed too many times

1452
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:23,359
we're back to the number of sprays I

1453
00:51:21,199 --> 00:51:25,159
remember what I remember the issue you

1454
00:51:23,358 --> 00:51:27,239
were going through and everything well

1455
00:51:25,159 --> 00:51:28,879
it work I solved that issue created a

1456
00:51:27,239 --> 00:51:30,919
whole new mess of problems for myself

1457
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:33,880
doing it don't spray your hash with a

1458
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:35,720
torch see we're all learning [ __ ] yeah

1459
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:37,440
yeah you don't learn or if you don't

1460
00:51:35,719 --> 00:51:39,318
[ __ ] up you don't learn that's what I'm

1461
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:40,400
I think I taught you that or I think

1462
00:51:39,318 --> 00:51:41,639
I've said that I don't know if I taught

1463
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:43,599
you that but I know everybody's taught

1464
00:51:41,639 --> 00:51:45,598
me that life is taught me that trust me

1465
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:47,119
yeah but I [ __ ] up on a big scale like

1466
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:49,160
I was going big and I kind of ruined

1467
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:50,838
some [ __ ] by doing it but we all do they

1468
00:51:49,159 --> 00:51:52,440
made a lot of good hash we learn those

1469

1567
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:40,079
of evil joke uh I just had a whole bunch

1568
00:55:37,559 --> 00:55:42,280
of cool R running moments through my

1569
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:44,039
head that's probably coinciding with

1570
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:45,079
that X Games [ __ ] or something else

1571
00:55:44,039 --> 00:55:46,520
going on you know what I mean I don't

1572
00:55:45,079 --> 00:55:47,760
know for sure but I would just assume

1573
00:55:46,519 --> 00:55:49,280
since that's the way events like to do

1574
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:50,839
it they piggy back on each other just to

1575
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:52,599
make money and they make it seem like

1576
00:55:50,838 --> 00:55:55,000
it's just a nice casual try probably

1577
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:56,640
heated stage by now you know heated

1578
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,960
stage

1579
00:55:56,639 --> 00:56:01,519

1580
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:03,400
