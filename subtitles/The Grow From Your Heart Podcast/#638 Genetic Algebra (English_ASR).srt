00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:36,639
it worked but it was still kind of funky

68
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:39,518

the secret stash seed exchange in denver

127

colorado on may 22nd

128
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,439
i've been saying that most of the slots

129
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:20,478
are sold out however they did add

130
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:22,319
another time slot the way that this

131
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:23,519
event is working people are being given

132
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:24,800
a certain amount of time

133
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:26,319
to move through the building you'll get

134
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,360
to see all of the vendors who get to see

135
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:28,959
all of the exhibits

136
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,400
and then your time slot will be up and a

137
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:31,039
new group of people will move into the

138
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:32,879
building

139
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,800
this is to adhere to coveted

140
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:36,159
restrictions to keep everybody safe

141
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,680
basically just to be able to

142
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,439
be allowed to have a building or an

143
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,040
event in a building these are the types

144
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:43,600
of restrictions we need to follow

145
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,240
the point is they have added a full

146
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,680
another

147
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,120
time slot so if you're trying to get

148

tickets and the time you wanted wasn't

149
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,399

150
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:52,000

173
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,199

all right where do we go from there i

179
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:43,279
think i talked about all the important

180
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,199
stuff

181
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:47,279
another thing i wanted to talk about on

182
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,879
facebook i've been seeing people talking

183
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:50,719
on facebook social media

184
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:51,918
i scroll too much that's what i do and

185
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,280
i'm trying to relax a little bit

186
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:54,639
possibly pooping

187
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:56,559
but let's talk about what i saw on

188
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,879
social media people ask

189
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,759
uh often what nutrients should i be

190
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:02,399
using for an

191
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:04,400
outdoor grow i'm going to address this

192
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:05,519
in another question here soon but

193
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:07,279
the thing you should be using in an

194
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:08,399
outdoor grow something i would recommend

195
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:09,198
is i wouldn't go with the bottled

196
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:11,679
nutrients

197
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,680
i would go with amended soil and put

198
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,478
that plant right in the amended soil

199
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,918
and then feed it water and teas and top

200
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:19,199
dress it don't focus on bottled

201
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:20,799
nutrients outdoors

202
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,478
that's going to be a fiasco in my

203
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,360
opinion i think it would be more

204
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:25,599
beneficial

205
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,720
to focus on building a soil having a

206
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,199
starter soil

207
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,080
then amend that as times go time goes on

208
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,160
top dress

209
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:33,758
feed it tease then mainly you just got

210
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,160
to keep it wet and things will be

211
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,960
okay so when it comes to the best

212
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,439
nutrients for

213
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:40,799
an organic outdoor grow i would just

214
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:42,319
build that amended soil

215
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,680
and rock with some super soil or

216
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,879
something like that again i'm not the

217
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,079
organics expert

218
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:48,079
there are plenty of people out there

219
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:49,279
doing that

220
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:51,598
plenty of people out there who can give

221
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:53,119
you great organics advice refer to those

222
00:06:51,598 --> 00:06:53,918
folks again that is not my area of

223
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,000
expertise

224
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:57,439
i do not want to mess you up all right

225
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,720
i've talked about all the stuff i

226
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:00,079
wanted to cover at the top of the show i

227
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,599
covered the news i covered the social

228
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:03,839
media stuff i saw

229
00:07:01,598 --> 00:07:05,918

235
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:14,560

236
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:16,959
did not work

237
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,399

246
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:33,359
podcast but also the irie

247
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:35,198
genetics support the ivory army wouldn't

248
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,038
be what it is without my friend the

249
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,800
kinetocrat big salute brother

250
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:40,719
all right now this first message came

251
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,319
from my friend lemur priest once again

252
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,039
big shout out to lemur priest

253
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,240
captain and commander of the irie army

254
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:48,000
he got stoned and

255
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,280
started reading stuff on seed packs

256
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,240
we're gonna kind of cut his message

257
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:54,000
short because

258
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:56,560
uh he wrote like multiple pages here um

259
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
i think he had a couple too many dabs

260
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,240
maybe but we're going to kind of

261
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,519
uh paraphrase what my buddy lemur said

262
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,038
we're going to make a good message out

263
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:05,519
of this it says i got

264
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:08,000
an idea about reading the listed

265
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:10,000
lineages of cultivars on seed packs and

266
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,759
websites that's a really good idea

267
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,959
we're going to get to the the topic of

268
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,560
this here of what he's actually talking

269
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:16,959
about it says hey ross to jeff

270
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,879
i'm humbled by your uh by the community

271
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:20,560
built around the podcast and your seed

272
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,800
company big thanks to you

273
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,879
i've been able to meet so many amazing

274
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,720
growers from all over the world

275
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,400
not everyone knows that there was a time

276
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,960
that sharing knowledge tips or helping

277
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:31,038
someone

278
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:33,360
else in their cannabis grow in any way

279
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:34,000
was a big no-no between being illegal at

280
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,440
the time

281
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,038
and mostly being used as a way for

282
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,399
someone to make or save money and the

283
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:40,479
investment of learning how to grow

284
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,958
relatively on your own there were lots

285
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,879
of incentives not to share tips yes

286
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:46,239
all of that makes sense back in the day

287
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:47,679
why would i teach you how to grow

288
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,120
because i'm the weed grower i'm going to

289
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:50,799
make all the money why would i give you

290
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,240
part of the pie part of the game

291
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:53,359
you could buy it from me and then resell

292
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,959
it if you want but i'm not going to

293
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,800
teach other people how to grow i agree

294
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:58,958
that used to be the mindset

295
00:08:56,799 --> 00:09:00,159
that's why it took me a long time to

296
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:01,679
cave in and get into commercial

297
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:03,360
cultivation i didn't want to go teach

298
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:05,359
other people my tricks for an hourly

299
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,919
wage that didn't feel right

300
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,278
so yes i was illegal other people

301
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:10,639
couldn't know other people were going to

302
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:10,958
cut in on your market so we couldn't

303
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:13,278
share

304
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:14,399
tips and no yes we are in a state a

305
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:16,720
realm a time

306
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,000
an area a community where we could just

307
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,680
share the knowledge and i feel it's kind

308
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,120
of my duty to share the knowledge that

309
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:22,000
i've learned i talk a lot i've got the

310
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,639
gift of gab

311
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,320
obviously i just cannot shut up i can't

312
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:27,759
stop talking and i love cannabis i'm

313
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,680
passionate about cannabis

314
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:31,120
and i want you guys to be as good of a

315
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:32,879
grower as me i want you to enjoy

316
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,519
cannabis as much as i do so i feel like

317
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:35,600
it's my

318
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,720
my duty to come out here and share this

319
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,320
anyway it says

320
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,000
i remember getting lots of strange

321
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,440
skeptical looks from grower friends when

322
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,720
i would offer advice and tips

323
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,480
they would tell me it's weird i would

324
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,160
help them improve their plants because

325
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,600
uh they would have better herb and make

326
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:49,919
more money but honestly i was only

327
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,360
thinking about helping plants be happier

328
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:52,240
that's what it's all about bro make the

329
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,839
plants happier

330
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,440
the person that grows it is happier the

331
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,720
person that smokes it is happier grow

332
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,399
from your heart breed with love that's

333
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,040
what it's all about

334
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,799
uh he does talk a lot here our friend is

335
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:04,719
a teacher he says i love teaching

336
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:06,078
i found a place anyway we're going to

337
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,519
kind of skip a lot i could ask for

338
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:08,879
advice there's a lot he goes

339
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,879
on it says the peanut butter breath

340
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:11,838
batter has me ranting and sentimental

341
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:13,439
yes it does brother

342
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,200
i had to cut out several paragraphs of

343
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,279
what you were saying but i got nothing

344
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,399
but love for you bro there is a good

345
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:21,919
question in here um as i'm looking over

346
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,600
my seed collection reading the different

347
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:25,519
parents i noticed how some can be a

348
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,800
little confusing yes

349
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,639
if you're not immersed in the cannabis

350
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:30,719
world things can be confusing irie

351
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:32,720
genetics does a wonderful job of either

352
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,720
using cultivars with names or naming

353
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,480
them if you created them however some

354
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,200
breeders are not so helpful with that

355
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,039
yes

356
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,040
uh when i cross stuff i try to represent

357
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:43,039
the parent names in the cross in some

358
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:44,639
way shape or form or i try to

359
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:45,919
put the cross on the package really

360
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:46,958
clearly so that you know what i'm

361
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:49,278
working with

362
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:50,879
says sometimes a new cultivar isn't

363
00:10:49,278 --> 00:10:52,958
something that is released and only used

364
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:55,278
for breeding purposes when that happens

365
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:57,119
this is when many of the parentheses are

366
00:10:55,278 --> 00:10:59,120
used could you walk us through

367
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,120
some of the things we could see and what

368
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,519
they mean for the way they were bred all

369
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,200
right

370
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,480
now this there's a lot of talking going

371
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,120
on here but i understand what you're

372
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,399
asking

373
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:10,320
let me get to answering your question uh

374
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:13,200
he does break down some examples he says

375
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,360
for example picho g from ethos is peach

376
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:18,079
crescendo to millions of peaches

377
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,919
to quattro kush f3 how the three

378
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:21,199
cultivars are across make peacho g

379
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:23,679
and how is it different then and then

380
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,920
you list another thing um

381
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:27,120
this is this is a good question so let

382
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:28,958
me kind of back up because there is a

383
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,320
lot to talk about here

384
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:31,759
also shout out to lemur for the great

385
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,640
message this is going to get me talking

386
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:34,559
a lot

387
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:35,679
so the question is when we see multiple

388
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:37,359
strains listed

389
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:39,919
on a seed package how do we know which

390
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:42,159
was the male which crosses were which

391
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:43,838
used in that cross so a lot of times

392
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:47,360
basically you're going to see

393
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:50,160
strain a x strain b

394
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,680
in basic horticultural practices the

395
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:55,120
standard is to use

396
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:56,879
ladies first female plant x male plant

397
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,360
that's going to mean that the male plant

398
00:11:56,879 --> 00:11:59,919
was the pollen donor and the plant

399
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,919
listed

400
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:03,599
first at the second plant was the pollen

401
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:04,319
donor the plant listed first was the

402
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,040
pollen

403
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,160
receiver so it's ladies first uh so

404
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:10,399
we're gonna say

405
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:11,679
uh golden goat to daybreaker you got a

406
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,480
golden goat female

407
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:15,439
a daybreaker male that daybreaker pollen

408
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,600
pollen donor

409
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,040
pollinated the female i'm stepping all

410
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,639
over my words but we're gonna get there

411
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:22,719
together just follow along

412
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,000
the daybreaker male pollinated the

413
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,639
golden goat female

414
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,039
to make a rise seeds so when you buy a

415
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,759
rye

416
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:30,639
seeds it says arise then in parentheses

417
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:33,360
underneath it

418
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,879
golden goat crossed daybreaker that's

419
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,480
real easy to understand that that is

420
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:37,679
golden goat and daybreaker and then you

421
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,959
know that golden goat

422
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:41,519
is this like sweet uh candy flavored gum

423
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:43,199
flavored

424
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,639
tropical sativa kind of thing with a

425
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,519
nice head buzz that makes you [ __ ]

426
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,799
weird high

427
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,159
and then you know that the daybreaker

428
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:49,838
maybe you know about daybreaker if not

429
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:51,838
i'll tell you about it daybreaker

430
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,519
is chem d and joseph og and it's real

431
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:56,160
stinky it smells funky

432
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,278
uh it's got like uh burnt tennis balls

433
00:12:56,159 --> 00:13:00,240
burnt rubber

434
00:12:57,278 --> 00:13:02,799
uh gassy skunky foot terps just funky

435
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,879
weird [ __ ] maybe some swamp ass in there

436
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:06,078
it's a short squatty plant so i know

437
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:08,320
both of those plants by

438
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:10,159
name now if i really wanted to i could

439
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,680
research both of those golden goat and

440
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:13,120
daybreaker and i could go further and

441
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:14,958
find the parents of each one and then

442
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,480
even further to find their parents

443
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:18,319
and i could learn about the family tree

444
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,200
the genetics the history the genealogy

445
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,160
the breakdown

446
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:24,320
the recipe if you will uh for each plant

447
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:26,879
so it's real easy when you've got

448
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,399
plant a and plant b grow plants a boy

449
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:29,919
plant right that's real simple for you

450
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,720
because you got two ingredients to work

451
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:32,240
with

452
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,759
what we're starting to see like our

453
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,200
friend lemur

454
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:37,360
mentioned here and pointed out to us and

455
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,480
highlighted is that sometimes we see

456
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,199
what do we got

457
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,159
crescendo to millions of peaches to

458
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:45,439
quattro kush

459
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:46,879
f3 how do we know which plant is the

460
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,040
male pollen donor in there because we

461
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:50,639
got three different things

462
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:52,559
one of those had to be a pollen donor

463
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,240
one of them had to be a female

464
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:55,439
then one of those plants had to

465
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,519
pollinate something else because you

466
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,079
can't put three plants into one mix like

467
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:00,480
that

468
00:13:58,078 --> 00:14:02,000
so without a parenthesis in the what i

469
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,680
would call the appropriate or proper

470
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
place i don't know which plant was the

471
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:08,399
male i could do research

472
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,919
but as a seed seller and a seed breeder

473
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,360
why do i want to give somebody an

474
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:12,879
assignment or homework

475
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,639
when i could just tell you the answer on

476
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:16,559
my seed pack i could say oh that's

477
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:19,120
the quattro kush was the male or the

478
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:21,039
[ __ ] millions of peaches was the male

479
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,240
i'm going to assume because of the way

480
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:23,599
it's listed but you know what happens

481
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,519
when i assume i'm going to make an ass

482
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,600
out of everybody involved here

483
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,039
i would say the quattro cush f3 was the

484
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,759
pollen donor

485
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:33,519
and then probably crescendo to millions

486
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:35,838
of peaches was one cross

487
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,440
and they pollinated that with the

488
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,279
quattro kush now here's a way that they

489
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,800
would have made that more clear

490
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:42,799
and it would have been obvious and

491
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:45,759
apparent which the male plant was

492
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:47,120
a set of parentheses just around two

493
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:49,600
strain names would indicate

494
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,198
this is one plant so i don't know the

495
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,278
actual breakdown but hypothetically

496
00:14:51,198 --> 00:14:56,078
we've got peach crescendo

497
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:57,439
uh to millions of peaches to quattro

498
00:14:56,078 --> 00:14:58,559
cush f3 and that's written on two

499
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,680
different papers that's why i'm looking

500
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:01,278
back and forth

501
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:03,759
if i wanted to make it clear which was

502
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:04,958
the male and we're going to just assume

503
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:07,198
for this project for

504
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:08,000
for words and uh what we're talking

505
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:10,159
about right now

506
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,519
that the quattro cush was the male i

507
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:13,600
would simply put

508
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:15,278
peach crescendo to millions of peaches

509
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,399
in a parentheses and that would say this

510
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:19,120
is one plant

511
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:19,519
and since that one plant is listed first

512
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,440
uh

513
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,120
then the quattro kush listed after that

514
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,760
i would assume the quattro cushes the

515
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,839
male

516
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:26,958
what this would tell me is it is peach

517
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:29,040
crescendo

518
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:30,879
pollinated by millions of peaches that

519
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:32,480
would go in one parentheses that made

520
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:32,958
seeds those seeds were grown we found a

521
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,800
keeper

522
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:36,638
there that is peach crescendo to

523
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:37,758
millions of peaches in parentheses that

524
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:39,198
became one plant

525
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,399
i would just give that a name to make

526
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:41,039
that easier you know what i mean that

527
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,399
would be [ __ ]

528
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:43,360
so much easier give it a name and then

529
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,720
you don't have to have two different

530
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,600
names x something

531
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,360
i digress ah so in parentheses peach

532
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,720
crescendo to millions of peaches i know

533
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,039
that's a female peach crescendo

534
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:55,680
pollinated by a male millions of peaches

535
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:57,198
it made seeds then in this case since

536
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:57,679
those two are in the parentheses then

537
00:15:57,198 --> 00:16:00,799
there's an

538
00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:02,000
x and there's quattro kush f3 that would

539
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:05,198
indicate to me

540
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,958
that the quattro kush f3 pollinated

541
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:08,879
that plant that was in the parentheses

542
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:10,399
there that is going to be our female

543
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:12,159
it turns into algebra it looks like a

544
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,759
math problem but it all makes sense once

545
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:15,759
you start to understand it

546
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:17,519
it makes clear clear sense i'll try to

547
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:18,959
put some stuff on the screen

548
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,560
it depends on what i can do with final

549
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:21,198
cut pro i didn't think that through when

550
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:22,399
i said it

551
00:16:21,198 --> 00:16:23,679
but i know i'll be able to put some

552
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,039
examples up on the screen because final

553
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:26,000
cut pro is awesome and i'm getting good

554
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:28,319
at it so

555
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,679
um an example of a male to female would

556
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,920
just be male plant

557
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:33,439
or no sorry i [ __ ] that up a fan an

558
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:34,879
example of a male to female plant would

559
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:38,800
be listed as female

560
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:40,879
x male girl plant times male plant makes

561
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:42,000
baby plant that's that easy right now

562
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:45,120
what if we take

563
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,720
what if i did not name a rise what if a

564
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,759
rise just didn't get a name

565
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:51,278
it would be golden goat x daybreaker

566
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,320
in parentheses that's what that plant

567
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:53,679
would be called because it doesn't have

568
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,680
a name it's a cross

569
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:57,039
golden goat's a daybreaker now what if

570
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:59,120
we cross that

571
00:16:57,039 --> 00:17:00,958
to strawberry fields to make the

572
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,000
strawberry starburst it would be golden

573
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:04,480
goat

574
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,759
x daybreaker and parentheses x

575
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,078
strawberry fields

576
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:09,279
that would make the uh strawberry

577
00:17:08,078 --> 00:17:10,399
starburst there i'm not sure what i said

578
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:11,279
cause i'm trying to think all this all

579
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,360
at once but that would make the

580
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:15,038
strawberry starburst there

581
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:16,558
so it's all about that parentheses i'm

582
00:17:15,038 --> 00:17:18,480
gonna read more into lemur's

583
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:20,720
message and make sure i keep myself on

584
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,439
track here he says how is that different

585
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,120
from

586
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:26,880
okay how is the uh peach og from ethos

587
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:29,519
how is that different than

588
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,960
uh stromulin from romulan genetics which

589
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:33,599
is in parentheses

590
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,720
forum cut girl scout cookies x purple

591

panty dropper

592
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,079
in parentheses cross to romulan so it's

593
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:41,359
forum

594
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:43,599
cut girl scout cookies x purple panty

595
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:45,759
dropper and those two are in parentheses

596
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:47,678
and then that is listed x romulan which

597
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:49,359
is a very clear description right there

598
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:51,840
that tells me that in this first set of

599
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:52,879
parentheses we've got forum cut girl

600
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:55,038
scout cookies

601
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,559
crossed to the purple panty dropper if

602
00:17:55,038 --> 00:17:58,000
they listed that correctly if they

603
00:17:56,558 --> 00:18:00,079
followed industry standard

604
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,400
that is a forum cut girl scout cookies

605
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,918
female uh which is clone only so that

606
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,600
would make sense that that's a female

607
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,360
clone only is a whole another [ __ ]

608
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:09,839
can of worms to open up

609
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:12,000
we got this forum cut cookies pollinated

610
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:12,639
by a purple panty dropper that made one

611
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,720
plant

612
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,759
that was grown they found a keeper out

613
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,000
of that plant

614
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:19,519
in this scenario it was female because

615
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,640
it is listed first

616
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:25,119
that was pollinated by a male romulan

617
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,160
plant so we've got parentheses starting

618
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:28,879
parentheses right

619
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,880
forum cut girl scout cookies x purple

620
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,559
panty dropper closing parentheses that's

621
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,720
all in the set of parentheses there

622
00:18:32,558 --> 00:18:35,678
x romulan so you're going to get i'm

623
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:39,120
going to call it

624
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:39,440
a purple uh cookie dropper right because

625
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:41,038
it's

626
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,960
[ __ ] purple panty dropper and girl

627
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:44,640
scout cookies just name that something

628
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,038
and we can make this a lot easier

629
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,240
purple cookie dropper to romulan and

630
00:18:47,038 --> 00:18:49,519
that's going to be [ __ ]

631
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,279
the klingon or some show we're just

632
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:52,798
going to call it klingon you see it

633
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:54,079
happened that quickly we made a strain

634
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,279
we named it we got rid of all the

635
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:57,359
[ __ ] parentheses

636
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:59,119
so much easier that way uh the next

637
00:18:57,359 --> 00:19:02,000
example that lemur throws at me

638
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:03,759
is how about uh how how girl scout

639
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,279
cookie the purple panty dropper wasn't

640
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:07,038
a named strain that was released and

641
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:08,000
used in the breeding project not to be

642
00:19:07,038 --> 00:19:10,000
confused

643
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,599
uh yeah you're that's exactly what i was

644
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,798
talking about that plant wasn't named so

645
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:14,000
it doesn't have a name which makes

646
00:19:12,798 --> 00:19:15,359
everything confusing

647
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,279
here he asked about another one if

648
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:20,159
you're feeling adventurous there is

649
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:21,119
snake eyes from motor rebel genetics uh

650
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,360
big shout out to

651
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:25,119
motor rebel because i wanted to use

652
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:26,959
snake eyes that's a really great [ __ ]

653
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:29,519
name i got storm shadow snake eyes would

654
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:31,279
have been a great accompanying name

655
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:32,798
good work bro i'm glad you beat me to it

656
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:34,079
i'm not mad at all it's a [ __ ] good

657
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:35,440
name i'm proud that i wanted to use a

658
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:36,879
name and somebody else had already used

659
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,279
it i mean it's a good one anyway

660
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,720
that one is all in parentheses and it

661
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:44,160
says

662
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:46,240
gg4 to kosher cush to heroin number one

663
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,200
all in parentheses right there so i

664
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,558
don't know

665
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,480
but i don't know the mail of that one

666
00:19:48,558 --> 00:19:52,079
i'm going to assume it's the gorilla

667
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,440
glue number four to kosher kush was

668
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:56,000
pollinated by the heroin

669
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,600
number one but again i'm just assuming i

670
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,679
don't know what that breeder did there's

671
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:00,319
a missing parentheses there that doesn't

672
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:01,919
do anything

673
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:03,599
it [ __ ] it all up for me to tell you

674
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:06,559
the truth and then that was

675
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:07,279
x to lemon g to lemon thai which is

676
00:20:06,558 --> 00:20:09,678
going to be

677
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:12,000
a lemon g female which is clone only

678
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:14,960
pollinated by the lemon thyme male

679
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,480
so uh without the correct parentheses

680
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,558
order there that's just a jumbled

681
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,360
[ __ ] of a mess and i really don't

682
00:20:18,558 --> 00:20:22,158
know

683
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:24,000
uh what was used i know that it's a gg4

684
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:26,480
to kosher kush to hairy

685
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,519
female pollinated by a lemon oh g lemon

686
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,640
thyme male but

687
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:32,000
that gg4 kosher kush harawana cross

688
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,600
couldn't tell you where the mail was

689
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,640
because of the way it is listed i want

690
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:37,519
to assume

691
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:39,360
that the heroina was the male because

692
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:41,200
it's last in that list but

693
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:42,399
i can't promise anything because this

694
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,600
breeder didn't give me enough

695
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,679
information

696
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:47,678
um on top of the parentheses you're

697
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:50,480
going to see brackets occasionally

698
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,360
so we may have parent bracket

699
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,679
parentheses

700
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:55,199
parentheses and then brackets and then

701
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:55,519
they're getting creative on how they do

702
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,440
it

703
00:20:55,519 --> 00:20:58,879
when you see it it will be apparent i'll

704
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,320
try to put some of that stuff up on the

705
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,840
screen also just so you can see what i'm

706
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:03,678
talking about but that's how

707
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:05,599
instead of using two sets of parentheses

708
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,559
because what if i took we're going to go

709
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:09,599
even further

710
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:11,759
the gg4 to kosher kush to hero wanna

711
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:13,119
cross to the lemon g to lemon tie what

712
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:16,158
if i crossed that

713
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:18,319
to the uh forum cut

714
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,760
gsc to purple panty dropper to romulan

715
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:21,200
now we've got so many things with

716
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:23,359
parentheses around it

717
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,640
uh i would just put the brackets around

718
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:25,918
all of that to indicate it's just one

719
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,759
[ __ ] thing or put it on

720
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:30,000
either side to show you that it's one

721
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:31,599
big thing this to this to this is

722
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,038
actually just it'll make sense once you

723
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:34,558
see it on the screen but sometimes

724
00:21:33,038 --> 00:21:36,000
you're going to see brackets in there

725
00:21:34,558 --> 00:21:37,918
that's going to confuse people that is

726
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,759
the next thing people are going to see

727
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:41,200
so he wraps it up with i think it's a

728
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:44,400
set of parentheses

729
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,840
i think i think of it as each set of

730
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,919
parentheses as a plan

731
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:49,439
and inside is what makes it up there are

732
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:50,080
countless other examples it might be

733
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,000
easier

734
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:53,439
uh yes your any more examples we're

735
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,480
going to confuse people more but i think

736
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,798
that is the thing

737
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,599
uh that needs to be said inside of each

738
00:21:56,798 --> 00:22:00,319
parentheses

739
00:21:57,599 --> 00:22:01,678
is each plant and you can tell which

740
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:03,200
plant was broken down

741
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:05,038
inside of that parentheses and then it's

742
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,519
crossed to the thing that it's got x's

743
00:22:05,038 --> 00:22:06,798
too

744
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:08,480
i think you guys understand what i'm

745
00:22:06,798 --> 00:22:09,759
trying to say more words on that are

746
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,159
just going to make it

747
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:13,119
more foggy all right lemur i hope i

748
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:14,559
answered your question

749
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:15,918
i hope everybody else out there learned

750
00:22:14,558 --> 00:22:17,038
something from that i hope i didn't just

751
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:19,360
confuse you more

752
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:20,558
um without seeing it on a screen without

753
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:22,558
writing it

754
00:22:20,558 --> 00:22:24,558
this is kind of hard to teach it's like

755
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:26,158
algebra you gotta [ __ ] follow along

756
00:22:24,558 --> 00:22:27,678
with the visual aids and all that stuff

757
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,960
all at the same time

758
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,080
all right i'm gonna take a quick drink

759
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,679
of some coconut water and then we're

760
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:32,879

761
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:34,240
don't think i'm gonna press pause i

762
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,600
don't think i'm gonna edit anything i'm

763
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,319
just gonna make you endure this drink

764

with the show

767
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:54,480
all right all right all right thanks for

768
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,200
giving me an opportunity to wet my

769
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,679
whistle

770
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,319
let's keep going here this next one is a

771
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:00,159
nutrient

772
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:01,678
and feeding question i said a moment ago

773
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:03,280
we were going to talk about

774
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,960
outdoor feeding and feeding organically

775
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:07,440
this person is growing indoors

776
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,200
but my advice will still apply let me

777
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,120
start with the message it says

778
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,480
greetings and salutations greetings my

779
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:13,759

and thank you for the great message it

781
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:17,119
says it's been a while since my last

782
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:18,159
question i hope this finds you in the

783
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:20,798
entire army

784
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:22,000
ire army safely and doing wonderfully in

785
00:23:20,798 --> 00:23:23,599
the desire of wanting to become

786
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,839
a seed tester for you down the road i've

787
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:28,480
been happily and diligently working

788
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:30,319
toward dialing in my grow room here are

789
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,679
some parameters and then we do go over

790
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:32,558
quite a few parameters which i will

791
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:34,798
touch on

792
00:23:32,558 --> 00:23:36,639
uh as i answer the actual question we

793
00:23:34,798 --> 00:23:38,639
don't need to read all of the parameters

794
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,480
uh a lot of the question will lead us

795
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:43,120
back up there to talk about that so

796
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:45,440
it says first off i'm trying to be as

797
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:47,199
organic of a grower as possible that's

798
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,759
admirable i do appreciate and respect

799
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,919
that

800
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:51,679
it says can you see any flaws or

801
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:54,559
possible deficiencies

802
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:55,600
in my soil and liquid selections and can

803
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:58,480
you make any

804
00:23:55,599 --> 00:24:00,158
suggestions so we've got a good soil we

805
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,599
got nature's living soil we got bud

806
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:04,720
swell we got recharge

807
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:07,839
and we've got happy frog i am not

808
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:09,919
absolutely certain of any of the organic

809
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:11,519
uh certifications of any of those

810
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:13,840
products i definitely don't know about

811
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:16,079
recharge i don't know about happy frog

812
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:18,000
i think bud swell is organic but i can't

813
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:20,399
promise you that any of those are are

814
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,240
actually organic products uh look for an

815
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,360
omri listing on the package that's my

816
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,359
advice there

817
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:26,879
then bud swell i do think that's organic

818
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:29,359
that's just bottled uh

819
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,000
uh [ __ ] bat guano to the best of my

820
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:32,879
knowledge

821
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,079
we got elementally green big buds i

822
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,600
don't know what that product is i did

823
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:37,199
not research that one

824
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:39,359
then we list two products that concern

825
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,600
me right away terpinator

826
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:43,119
i don't think i'm going to assume and

827
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:44,639
we've talked about assuming once in this

828
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:46,558
episode maybe twice

829
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,720
i'm going to assume that terpinator is

830
00:24:46,558 --> 00:24:50,399
not an organic product it could be

831
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,000
i could be completely [ __ ] wrong but

832
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,200
from what i remember what i see on that

833
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
bottle when i'm looking at it through

834
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,519
memory

835
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,759
that's not organic so you might want to

836
00:24:55,519 --> 00:25:00,720
read about that then you've got calmag

837
00:24:57,759 --> 00:25:01,919
as your next liquid uh which cow mag

838
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,360
there are a lot of brands out there a

839
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:05,038
lot of different products available

840
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:07,199
some may be organic but it's going to be

841
00:25:05,038 --> 00:25:10,240
hard to find a straight pure liquid

842
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:12,558
organic calmag solution i think i've

843
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,400
never looked for a purely organic calmag

844
00:25:12,558 --> 00:25:15,678
that could be a challenge so it depends

845
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,038
on the brand make sure you're checking

846
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:20,480
that omri listing

847
00:25:17,038 --> 00:25:22,558
for organics on your calmag so

848
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,079
the terminator the calmag those are the

849
00:25:22,558 --> 00:25:25,278
things that i would question

850
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:27,199
everything else you mentioned in here

851
00:25:25,278 --> 00:25:28,640
seems to make sense for your grow

852
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,558
the only thing you're not the only goal

853
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,240
you're not reaching is that a complete

854
00:25:30,558 --> 00:25:33,918
organic desire i don't know that you're

855
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,558
getting that with your list

856
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:38,240
now i said this on the other uh talk

857
00:25:36,558 --> 00:25:39,278
about the outdoor grow that i saw on

858
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,720
social media

859
00:25:39,278 --> 00:25:42,079
people are asking about what to grow

860
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,519
with outdoors so they can stay

861
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:44,960
completely organic which bottled

862
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:46,079
nutrients should they buy what products

863
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,360
should they use

864
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:49,839
i'm going to repeat what i said about

865
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:51,439
that uh if you're going to grow

866
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:54,319
completely organically and you don't

867
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:57,200
want to do salts and synthetic nutrients

868
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:58,879
why not just go with the full-on organic

869
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:01,278
amended soil the way that nature would

870
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:03,760
have done it go no-till go super soil

871
00:26:01,278 --> 00:26:05,599
go something like that get all of the

872
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:07,599
things that would go into the dirt

873
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:08,798
and get a big tarp and put it on the

874
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:12,079
garage floor

875
00:26:08,798 --> 00:26:14,000
mix up a couple of bags of uh whatever

876
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:15,359
soil is available right now damn it soil

877
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,200
and dirt are hard to get right now you

878
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:18,959
guys i've been to the grow store

879
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,360
a couple of grow stores to get products

880
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:23,120
and soil is low but

881
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:25,199
get the soilless mix the soil that you

882
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:26,399
can get and then mix in all of the

883
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,319
proper

884
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,480
amendments nutrients there are a lot of

885
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:32,558
different ways to mix up a super soil

886
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,319
i make this disclaimer often i do not

887
00:26:32,558 --> 00:26:36,558
claim to be an organic grower i

888
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:37,599
am not a super soil expert i can tell

889
00:26:36,558 --> 00:26:39,278
you the basics

890
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:40,558
but there are plenty of websites there

891
00:26:39,278 --> 00:26:41,839
are plenty of things on the internet

892
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:43,599
that will get you

893
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:45,599
building a great super soil they don't

894
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:49,038
pay me to say if they don't sponsor me

895
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:49,599
uh but buildasoil.com will be a great

896
00:26:49,038 --> 00:26:52,000
start

897
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:54,000
for building an organic soil and amended

898
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,679
soil so what i would do

899
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,679
i'd skip all the bottles i would skip

900
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:59,120
all this [ __ ] and i would mix up an

901
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:01,038
amended super soil

902
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:02,399
some sort of build a soil some sort of

903
00:27:01,038 --> 00:27:03,440
ready-mixed soil that you could put

904
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,200
those plants in

905
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,640
then all you've got to feed them is

906
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,400
maybe a top dress between

907
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,919
phases maybe like at the end of veg give

908
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,720
them a top dress right at the start of

909
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:12,720
flower

910
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,798
top dress right as they start to bloom a

911
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,319
specific top dress as they're going

912
00:27:14,798 --> 00:27:18,480
uh if they're getting bigger give them a

913
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:20,158
specific bloom booster top dress

914
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,440
i'm not the [ __ ] organic guy so i

915
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:22,480
don't know what to even tell you to top

916
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,080
dress or tea

917
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:26,640
teas would be a good idea feed them some

918
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:28,398
teas but if you want to go completely

919
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,240
organically and grow

920
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:31,599
organics and not have the bottles and

921
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,200
all that stuff and be sure that

922
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:34,000
everything you're using is organic i

923
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,640
would buy

924
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,599
amendments and mix up a good pre-amended

925
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,720
super soil

926
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:40,240
it's going to save you it's going to

927
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,000
take time in the beginning you're going

928
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,679
to spend a day mixing it up but

929
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,440
then you don't have to mix up nutrients

930
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:47,440
every time you water and that's why

931
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,038
to the outdoor growers who are looking

932
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,798
to do something organic outdoors and

933
00:27:49,038 --> 00:27:53,440
want to know what nutrients to use

934
00:27:50,798 --> 00:27:54,960
you're going to be watering every single

935
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,080
day outdoors do you want to spend the

936
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,000
time to mix up

937
00:27:56,079 --> 00:28:00,000
you might water 20 gallons out there do

938
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,119
you want to spend time mixing up 20

939
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,519
gallons of water

940
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:04,879
worth of nutrients every single day or

941
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:06,879
do you want to spend one or two days in

942
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,840
the garage mixing up a big fat batch of

943
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,679
super soil

944
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:11,439
put your plants in that and then just

945
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:12,880
water the whole cycle because all you've

946
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,880
got to do is keep them wet because

947
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:16,480
inside that soil is everything that they

948
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,880
need um

949
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,960
some of you organic growers insist that

950
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,720
the herb tastes better gets you higher

951
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,399
so if it's doing that it may be worth

952
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,919
the pre-mix i don't know the difference

953
00:28:24,398 --> 00:28:27,278
honestly i think it all gets me plenty

954
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:28,799
stone nowadays you guys are all growing

955
00:28:27,278 --> 00:28:32,480
such good weed

956
00:28:28,798 --> 00:28:34,319
but my advice would be to ditch 90

957
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:36,079
of these products if you've already got

958
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:37,839
them use them dude don't let me [ __ ] up

959
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:39,918
your plans your ideas but if you want to

960
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:41,759
stay as organic as possible

961
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:44,399
i would abandon ship on all these liquid

962
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:47,038
products and i would buy powders

963
00:28:44,398 --> 00:28:48,239
boxes of stuff organic stuff when you go

964
00:28:47,038 --> 00:28:49,359
to the grow store when you go to the

965
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,200
gardening store you'll see

966
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:53,199
all the boxes that you need all the dry

967
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,880
amendments they're all in one area

968
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,319
ah maybe you'll go to build a soil maybe

969
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,159
you'll go to your local grow shop i

970
00:28:56,319 --> 00:29:00,558
recommend you go to like the local

971
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:02,240
farm area the local farming store if you

972
00:29:00,558 --> 00:29:03,918
can if they're not going to bust you for

973
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,200
growing weed because sometimes

974
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:07,360
those people know what we're doing and

975
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,720
they may not like the way you look uh so

976
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:10,079
be careful where you're going but shop

977
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,759

can get it but

987
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:27,599
i would get away from the bottle and

988
00:29:25,038 --> 00:29:29,759
stuff if if you really want to be

989
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:30,719
and you said i'm trying to be as organic

990
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:33,519
of a grower as

991
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,960
possible bro i would really recommend uh

992
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:35,519
no-till growing for you i would

993
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,200
recommend

994
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:39,038
super soil i would recommend some type

995
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,440
of living soil growing for you that's

996
00:29:39,038 --> 00:29:41,359
not

997
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,600
how i do it that's not what i do but

998
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:45,119
you're saying as organic as possible and

999
00:29:43,599 --> 00:29:45,678
that is how you get as organic as

1000
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:48,558
possible

1001
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:50,320
no-till with a worm bin and [ __ ] a

1002
00:29:48,558 --> 00:29:52,798
compost pile

1003
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:54,000
it's really rewarding um i eat a lot of

1004
00:29:52,798 --> 00:29:55,679
vegetables and a lot of ends of

1005
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,880
vegetables end up in a bokashi bucket

1006
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:58,000
and stuff and to know that i'm making

1007
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,480
fertilizer

1008
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,159
with my leftover food scraps that's just

1009
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,159
rewarding so if you turn that into

1010
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:06,880
cannabis products you're gonna love that

1011
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:07,679
that's a good way to stay as organic as

1012
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,320
possible

1013
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:11,759
there are more questions to this one it

1014
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:12,960
says what are some considerations to

1015
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:15,679
have when deciding to grow

1016
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:17,360
a mother plant uh that's a really easy

1017
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:18,798
question it's like falling in love

1018
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:20,798
um if you're in love with that plant

1019
00:30:18,798 --> 00:30:22,558
keep it and grow it as a mother plant

1020
00:30:20,798 --> 00:30:24,319
i always recommend every time you grow a

1021
00:30:22,558 --> 00:30:26,000
cannabis plant take a clone

1022
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:27,839
like before you put a plant into flower

1023
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,278
get a clone because what you're growing

1024
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:30,639
could be the most amazing medicine

1025
00:30:29,278 --> 00:30:32,000
you've ever grown it could work in your

1026
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,000
grow better than everything you've ever

1027
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,200
grown it could work for your medicine

1028
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,798
could work for your wallet maybe you're

1029
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,159
a commercial grower growing for profit

1030
00:30:36,798 --> 00:30:39,679
maybe this one plant

1031
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:41,200
works better than everything for you

1032
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:43,840
take a freaking clone of

1033
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:45,519
everything you ever grow then if you

1034
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:46,879
find out that it's the hottest fire

1035
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:48,319
you've got a mother plant that is how

1036
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,600
you decide to keep a mother plant if you

1037
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:51,839
fell in love with that

1038
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:53,359
um something that sounds very crass but

1039
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:54,959
this is the absolute [ __ ] truth it's

1040
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:56,959
a lot like the dating pool

1041
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,399
uh if you got one option you're gonna

1042
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,759
keep that one you're gonna fall in love

1043
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:01,278
you'll be completely [ __ ] happy but

1044
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:03,038
if you got a bunch to choose from

1045
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:04,319
the one that stands out to you will be

1046
00:31:03,038 --> 00:31:05,599
the mother plant you want to keep

1047
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:07,038
something will tell you

1048
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:08,798
uh it's just like falling in love with a

1049
00:31:07,038 --> 00:31:10,398
person the way i fall in love with

1050
00:31:08,798 --> 00:31:12,319
plants is very similar

1051
00:31:10,398 --> 00:31:13,918
i see plants plants plants plants oh

1052
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:16,158
look at that plant that's just

1053
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:17,600
the way it happens to me just like it

1054
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:19,120
does with people it's like people people

1055
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:20,879
people damn look at her

1056
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:22,319
like i'm just attracted to specific

1057
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,360
things and the plants do it just like

1058
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:26,079
people do

1059
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:26,558
i get similar signals in my body that

1060
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:28,079
say

1061
00:31:26,558 --> 00:31:29,839
that plant right there bro that is the

1062
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:31,359
one you want to pick uh

1063
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:34,000
sometimes i'm wrong most of the time i'm

1064
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:35,599
right being a breeder being a

1065
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,599
seed selector being a commercial

1066
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:39,199
cultivator i get to see a lot of plants

1067
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:40,000
and i get to make a lot of selections

1068
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,759
and i'm getting

1069
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,440
pretty damn good at it i think so

1070
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:45,599
considerations to have when deciding

1071
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,200
to grow a mother plant is it a good

1072
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:49,199
plant did that plant work well for you

1073
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,720
did it meet all of your goals

1074
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,880
people ask me what do i pick for a

1075
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,480
phenotype what do you want dude

1076
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,159
pick the [ __ ] that you want in your

1077
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,519
garden did it smell the way you want did

1078
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:58,559
it taste the way you wanted it give you

1079
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:00,960
the buzz you want

1080
00:31:58,558 --> 00:32:02,639
did it flower in a timely manner did it

1081
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,000
work well for your grow did all the

1082
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,360
other plants in the room get powdery

1083
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,798
mildew except that one

1084
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:08,639
did all the other plants get hit by

1085
00:32:06,798 --> 00:32:10,480
mites except that one did all the other

1086
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,080
plants term out except that one

1087
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,839
were all the other plants like sevens

1088
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:15,199
but this one's a nine that nine is your

1089
00:32:13,839 --> 00:32:16,959
keeper mother plant bro

1090
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,159
so as long as it's a good plant as long

1091
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,840
as it makes you happy and you want to

1092
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:22,080
grow it again and keep it around

1093
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:23,278
that is a characteristic i look for in a

1094
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:25,038
mother plant you're basically just

1095
00:32:23,278 --> 00:32:25,919
preserving genetics to grow it over and

1096
00:32:25,038 --> 00:32:27,919
over again

1097
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:28,960
do you love it does it work is it

1098
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:30,960
successful

1099
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,798
keep it from other plant then it says

1100
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,960
lastly as a grower

1101
00:32:32,798 --> 00:32:37,278
how different how difficult is it to

1102
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:39,360
create an autoflower strain

1103
00:32:37,278 --> 00:32:41,919
i know autos are not necessarily your

1104
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:43,199
bag but i'm asking about what process

1105
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:45,679
would entail in

1106
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,798
general to create autoflower seeds

1107
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:48,960
that's a good question

1108
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:51,200
i am not an autoflower maker so

1109
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:53,600
everything i say right now is kind of

1110
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,798
partially coming out of my ass just a

1111
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:56,158
little bit but i know enough about

1112
00:32:54,798 --> 00:32:57,918
breeding and i know enough about seeds

1113
00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:00,080
that i can cover this i feel like

1114
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:01,840
um to make an autoflower you need an

1115
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:03,199
autoflower you need at least one

1116
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:05,119
autoflower so

1117
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,720
ah get a pack of autoflower seeds would

1118
00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:08,398
be the way to do that now because

1119
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,600
autoflowers you can't clone them they're

1120
00:33:08,398 --> 00:33:11,439
gonna flower

1121
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:12,798
that clone is the same age as the

1122
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,159
original plant which it came from

1123
00:33:12,798 --> 00:33:16,398
they're both gonna flower at the same

1124
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:18,159
time to the best of my understanding

1125
00:33:16,398 --> 00:33:19,918
so uh you're gonna have to get a pack of

1126
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:21,840
autoflower seeds i recommend

1127
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:23,278
uh feminized autoflowers if you can get

1128
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:25,199
them i think most of the people making

1129
00:33:23,278 --> 00:33:27,519
them are doing fems right now so

1130
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,558
get you an autoflower feminized seed

1131
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:31,919
pack then

1132
00:33:28,558 --> 00:33:34,000
uh grow them then um

1133
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:35,440
to create an autoflower strain so you

1134
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,159
need autoflower to [ __ ] have

1135
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,919
autoflower

1136
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:39,519
you need that trait to start with you

1137
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:41,440
can't make uh

1138
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:43,359
orange stuff without some orange so

1139
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,558
you're gonna need an autoflower plant in

1140
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:46,479
the mix

1141
00:33:44,558 --> 00:33:47,678
ah so get an autoflower plant and then

1142
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,319
get a regular plant

1143
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:51,038
and then you need to select most of us

1144
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:53,119
are gonna get

1145
00:33:51,038 --> 00:33:54,480
uh feminized autoflowers so you're going

1146
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:56,719
to have to get pollen from

1147
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,839
a regular male plant and then pollinate

1148
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,278
your autoflowers

1149
00:33:57,839 --> 00:34:01,278
those autoflowers are going to make

1150
00:33:59,278 --> 00:34:03,759
seeds ah

1151
00:34:01,278 --> 00:34:05,119
that is your f1 that's a real f1 you've

1152
00:34:03,759 --> 00:34:06,960
got a brand new cross a [ __ ]

1153
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:08,960
autoflower to a photo period

1154
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:11,199
you've just made a really unstable

1155
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:14,720
sloppy [ __ ] crazy

1156
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:17,678
uh really high-end variation f1

1157
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:19,199
find two of those that autoflower you

1158
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:20,720
gotta find a male and a female then

1159
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:21,838
autoflower at this point

1160
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,799
the only way you're going to know is to

1161
00:34:21,838 --> 00:34:23,918
grow them and they're going to

1162
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,440
autoflower

1163
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:27,118
so once you've found the male and female

1164
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,320
that meet the criteria you want they've

1165
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:30,639
got the shape and structure

1166
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:33,119
aroma the traits you desire the leaf

1167
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:34,720
shape and whatnot for your goal

1168
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:36,800
they're autoflowering you see them start

1169
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:37,678
to autoflower breed that male to that

1170
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,639
female

1171
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:42,720
now you've got f2 um they're not going

1172
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:45,838
to carry that autoflower trait

1173
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:48,398
until we get to about f5 f6

1174
00:34:45,838 --> 00:34:50,000
maybe f7 so you're going to have to keep

1175
00:34:48,398 --> 00:34:52,239
doing this process

1176
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,320
grow the seeds out find a male and a

1177
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:56,398
female to begin to autoflower on you

1178
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:58,400
put them in a room let them pollinate

1179
00:34:56,398 --> 00:35:00,639
each other get the seeds out

1180
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:02,400
find grow those seeds and veg find

1181
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:03,358
plants that meet the criteria you're

1182
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,838
looking for

1183
00:35:03,358 --> 00:35:06,960
plant shape plant structure stem rub

1184
00:35:05,838 --> 00:35:08,719
smell

1185
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:10,960
let them start flowering when they get

1186
00:35:08,719 --> 00:35:11,679
into flower let that male pollinate that

1187
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,079
female

1188
00:35:11,679 --> 00:35:16,719
we're probably at what now f2 f3 keep

1189
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:19,039
going until we get to f6 by then

1190
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:20,159
by then they should start coming out

1191
00:35:19,039 --> 00:35:22,559
more uniform

1192
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:24,159
more uniform each time another way you

1193
00:35:22,559 --> 00:35:25,759
can do it is by reversing that

1194
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:26,879
autoflower but that is a whole another

1195
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,400
ball game

1196
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,400
we're going to reverse the autoflower

1197
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,240
plant it'll make pollen you put that

1198
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,000
pollen on another plant

1199
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:35,439
hopefully a female that is autoflowering

1200
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,039
that's going to increase your chances of

1201
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:40,159
getting more autoflower

1202
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:41,519
more quickly again i am not an

1203
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:43,598
autoflower breeder

1204
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:45,280
i don't know exactly how many filial

1205
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:48,000
generations it would take to

1206
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:49,599
solidify that autoflower trait i think

1207
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,679
by selfing a couple of things you could

1208
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:53,760
probably lock it in

1209
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:55,440
maybe back crossing or something but i

1210
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,880
think by going forward in filial

1211
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,639
generation and just finding

1212
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,320
autoflower trade autoflower trade

1213
00:35:58,639 --> 00:36:00,799
autoflower trade that's going to lock it

1214
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,720
in

1215
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:04,000
that's probably the best way to do it

1216
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:05,838
all the other trades have to be

1217
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,719
secondary at that point that in my

1218
00:36:05,838 --> 00:36:09,199
opinion

1219
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:11,838
is why a lot of people find that

1220
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:13,838
autoflowers are inferior

1221
00:36:11,838 --> 00:36:15,759
our first trait that we're searching for

1222
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:17,039
most of the time is potency and quality

1223
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:20,000
right we're going for potency

1224
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:21,759
terps then after that we think about uh

1225
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,358
problems like is it resistant to bugs

1226
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,079
resistant to mildew does it handle the

1227
00:36:23,358 --> 00:36:25,598
room well

1228
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:27,839
but most of the time we go for potency

1229
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:29,519
and terps in autoflowers the main thing

1230
00:36:27,838 --> 00:36:30,480
the main trait we're looking for is

1231
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:32,400
autoflower

1232
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:34,240
so everything else is secondary in my

1233
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,960
opinion take that with a grain of salt

1234
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:37,439
you guys because

1235
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:39,440
like i said i'm not the autoflower guy

1236
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:41,280
all of what i just said

1237
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:43,039
came out my ass all right i tried to

1238
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,160
talk the best i could about that

1239
00:36:43,039 --> 00:36:45,599
i'm not an expert i feel like i'm

1240
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:46,719
knowledgeable i understand plants i

1241
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:48,240
understand breeding enough to have

1242
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:50,000
advice on that but again

1243
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:51,598
take that with a big stinky grain of

1244
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,320
salt all right i feel like i've been

1245
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:54,320
going on for

1246
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:56,320
