60
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:32,199
pet peeve is when I go into my friends

61
00:02:29,318 --> 00:02:35,119
grows and I see extension cords

62
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:37,000
everywhere it looks like a bird's nest I

63
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,120
just can't I just can't when I see that

64
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,639
it drives me crazy and when I ask where

65
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,319
the fire extinguisher and the smoke

66
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:45,399
detector are they say it is in the other

67
00:02:43,318 --> 00:02:46,919
room uh yeah that that is a

68
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,640
nerve-wracking when you go to a grow

69
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:49,878
space and it looks like spaghetti all

70
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:52,119
over the floor it just looks like a

71
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:53,639
jungle of extension cords it looks like

72
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,878
a big knot it looks like a big fire

73
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:57,439
hazard uh first of all it just looks

74
00:02:55,878 --> 00:02:59,120
like [ __ ] have some pride in your grow

75
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:00,639
space don't make it look like trash then

76
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,959
second of all uh you're going to trip

77
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:03,639
over that that's a tripping Hazard

78
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:04,799
you're going to be carrying a bucket of

79
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:05,919
water you're going to be thinking about

80
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:07,200
something else you're going to be

81
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:08,479
looking at the plants staring at the

82
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:09,679
plants like we do you're going to trip

83
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:12,878
over that cord you're going to fall on

84
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,280
your face uh when you fall when you trip

85
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:15,878
you're going to pull the fan pull that

86
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,080
whatever it is it's going to fall on

87
00:03:15,878 --> 00:03:18,518
some other [ __ ] you're going to fall

88
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,560
you're going to break some [ __ ] uh

89
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:21,319
you're going to spill whatever you got

90
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,360
in your hands that's a trip Hazard

91
00:03:21,318 --> 00:03:25,199
that's a problem don't do that also all

92
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,799
of those extension cords are fire

93
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:29,798
hazards that is a fire risk let's not OV

94
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:32,280
extension cord our grow space let's be

95
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:34,200
very conscious uh of and aware of the

96
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:36,158
electricity consumption and how it's

97
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:38,119
being distributed and dispersed through

98
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:40,479
the grow space especially if you are in

99
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:43,239
an old house uh old houses are not

100
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:45,399
designed to run thousand watt two three

101
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:46,519
th000 watt grow lights in a in a room

102
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,080
that's not what they should be doing

103
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:49,680
modern homes they should be able to

104
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,760
handle probably 1,000 watt light per

105
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,438
bedroom maybe more uh depending on your

106
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:55,120
Breakers go check your breaker box

107
00:03:53,438 --> 00:03:56,840
anyway I'm not qualified to give you

108
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,640
electrical advice but I am qualified to

109
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,200
say clean up after yourself get those

110
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:02,078
cords off the floor they look like [ __ ]

111
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:03,958
you're going to trip over them and they

112
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:06,400
are a fire hazard so that is a great

113
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:08,400
grow room pet peeve I absolutely agree

114
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,239
with you it looks like a bird's nest it

115
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,120
looks like a bag of spaghetti dumped on

116
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,438
the floor let's clean that up let's get

117
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,879
that organized try to get all of your

118
00:04:14,438 --> 00:04:19,159
cords up off the ground away from where

119
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:21,079
water could be in a commercial grow

120
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,600
environment when you build the grow

121
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:25,478
you're required to put all of your light

122
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:26,840
sockets and receptacles uh 3T or higher

123
00:04:25,478 --> 00:04:29,120
off the ground I believe it is I think

124
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:30,279
it's got to be 3T so in your house if

125
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,840
you're going to plug PL in the vacuum

126
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:33,638
plug in a fan plug in a light most of

127
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:35,719
the time you bend over the sockets are

128
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:37,680
down there in a commercial facility

129
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:39,400
they're up way higher in the event that

130
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,400
you do get a bunch of water and that

131
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:44,319
grow the water and the electricity do

132
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:46,679

00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:57,000
Inner City buds I apologize shout out to

166
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:59,079
my new friend inner city buds the

167
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,478
question is a general grow question and

168
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:04,719
it says says yo Gro bro what's up dude

169
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:06,079
it says what if and that's a good what

170
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,919
if I like this one it will get me

171
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:11,598
rambling very well it says what if a

172
00:06:08,918 --> 00:06:14,560
feminized plant went inter sex and

173
00:06:11,598 --> 00:06:16,360
pollinated another female plant would

174
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,519
these seeds be all feminized because

175
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:21,280
there is technically no male involved in

176
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:23,918
this breeding and one more thing How

177
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:26,439
likely would these seeds be How likely

178
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:28,758
would these seeds to be intersects

179
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:30,839
themselves if the intersect was caused

180
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:33,639
by stress and if so is there a way to

181
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:35,119
breed out the interex gene um okay

182
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:36,918
there's a lot of stuff going on in this

183
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,879
message to where I just want to back up

184
00:06:36,918 --> 00:06:41,240
and I want to really uh take this one

185
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:43,038
from the beginning so it says and this

186
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:46,360
is a great question but there's a lot to

187
00:06:43,038 --> 00:06:48,839
talk about here it says what if a

188
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:50,120
feminized plant went interx okay so

189
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:53,478
we've got a plant that came from a

190
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:55,759
feminized seed and then at some point in

191
00:06:53,478 --> 00:06:57,719
the flower it shows interex which means

192
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:00,560
it is a hermaphroditic plant it's got

193
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:02,639
both male and female uh parts so it's

194
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,319
going to throw pollen and it can also

195
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,319
receive pollen that's not mainly what we

196
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,439
want in the grow that is not ideal but

197
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:12,598
it is what is hypothetically happening

198
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:14,399
what if uh we've got a Fen plant and it

199
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:16,478
went intersects okay so it showed

200
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:19,758
intersects and it made pollen and that

201
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:22,719
pollen uh pollinated another female

202
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:24,560
plant okay that makes good sense so far

203
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,360
the question is would these seeds be all

204
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:30,399
fem because there is technically no male

205
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,720
involved well now technically there is

206
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:34,719
no male involved but we have to go back

207
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,400
because you do have a hermaphrodite

208
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,520
involved somewhere in the breeding there

209
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:41,120
is an intersex plant somewhere in the

210
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:43,598
breeding this plant just didn't turn

211
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,560
intersect this plant is intersect this

212
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:46,680
plant has always been an [ __ ] you

213
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,959
just had to give it the right

214
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,639
environment to express that [ __ ]

215
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:53,439
trait that's the best way I can describe

216
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:57,079
it so uh there may have not been any

217
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:58,959
male involved in the breeding which uh

218
00:07:57,079 --> 00:08:01,478
very possibly very possibly true there

219
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:04,158
was no male but at some point in this

220
00:08:01,478 --> 00:08:05,918
breeding there is an interex plant that

221
00:08:04,158 --> 00:08:08,519
interex plant could have came from

222
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:11,279
either side of that equation the pollen

223
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:13,158
donor or the pollen receiver and again

224
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:15,038
I'm start I'm talking about the starting

225
00:08:13,158 --> 00:08:18,279
female plant the plant that came from a

226
00:08:15,038 --> 00:08:21,079
feminized seed one of its parents was

227
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:23,638
interex or one of its parents was

228
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:26,158
interex either way that intersex trait

229
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:28,199
is in the lineup and when you bred to it

230
00:08:26,158 --> 00:08:30,319
you put that seed in the appropriate

231
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:32,519
environment and that ENT sex trait

232
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:35,519
expressed itself that is a phenotypical

233
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:38,080
expression that is a trait interex is a

234
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,959
trait just like Aroma just like Flavor

235
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,680
just like Vigor just like potency just

236
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:45,359
like pest resistance intersects is a

237
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:46,719
trait and it is in your breeding mix

238
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,600
there's more of the question here let me

239
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,480
keep reading it um we took a Fen plant

240
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,120
it went intersex pollinated another

241
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:55,800
female plant so you've got an intersex

242
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:58,039
plant pollinating a female plant we

243
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:59,879
can't say a female plant anymore because

244
00:08:58,039 --> 00:09:01,879
that plant is now intersec SE we crossed

245
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:03,919
out that female it's not a female this

246
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:06,200
plant is a hermaphrodite that is now

247
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:09,159
pollinated a female plant would these

248
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:11,600
seeds be all fem no these seeds will not

249
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:13,399
be all fem because they were not made

250
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,600
with two female plants they were made

251
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:17,120
with one hermaphrodite we crossed out

252
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,639
that one it's not a female anymore it

253
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,639
doesn't get to play female it's a

254
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:22,240
hermaphrodite we've seen both parts it

255
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:24,319
doesn't get to decide its gender we've

256
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,039
seen it science [ __ ] uh it is a

257
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,200
hermaphrodite so that's a hermaphroditic

258
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:30,120
plant that pollinated a female plant not

259
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,519
a female to female so we've got to

260
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:34,600
correct the whole project here has got

261
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:37,278
to be updated and corrected the data is

262
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,519
no longer accurate so um we are now

263
00:09:37,278 --> 00:09:40,919
taking a hermaphrodite plant and

264
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:42,959
pollinating a female plant the question

265
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:45,000
says uh because technically there's no

266
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:47,599
males no there's a hermaphrodite in here

267
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,159
How likely would these seeds be to be

268
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,959
interex themselves if the interex was

269
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:54,719
caused by stress the interex wasn't

270
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:57,278
caused by stress uh it presented itself

271
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,160
because of the stress the propensity the

272
00:09:57,278 --> 00:10:02,240
opportunity for those seeds to be

273
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:04,278
intersect um is 50/50 in my opinion you

274
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,639
would have to grow them and find out I

275
00:10:04,278 --> 00:10:07,439
definitely wouldn't give any of these

276
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:09,639
seeds to anybody that you like I would

277
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,640
grow them myself grow a hundred of them

278
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:14,439
before I share any of them but what

279
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:16,838
you're so what we've got to correct in

280
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:19,000
this is it was not a female plant this

281
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:21,440
was not a female Toof female interaction

282
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,879
this was an interex plant to a female

283
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:27,120
plant so your whole idea of the female

284
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:28,639
to female not making any uh male seeds

285
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,720
uh that is washed out because you're not

286
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:32,720
using the ingredients which you started

287
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,040
that you thought you started with so

288
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,560
somewhere along the line what needs to

289
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:37,958
happen I'm I'm thinking too many

290
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:39,759
thoughts at once I'm going to say this

291
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:41,759
one right now when you're making

292
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:43,399
feminized seeds what needs to happen is

293
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:45,600
every plant you are breeding with needs

294
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:48,519
to be stress tested and thoroughly

295
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,879
vigorously tested for interex traits

296
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:51,639
every plant in the room that you're

297
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:54,439
going to breed with the pollen donor the

298
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:56,480
pollen receivers all of them I do a lot

299
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:58,160
of stress testing I do a lot of uh

300
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,560
selection or a lot of very special

301
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:02,240
selection uh through when I do breeding

302
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:04,679
I won't use anything that shows me

303
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,680
intersect traits if it shows intersects

304
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:08,319
for any reason in my room I avoid

305
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:09,879
breeding with those plants and if I do

306
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,839
breed with those plants I keep them for

307
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:13,600
myself I really don't find a reason to

308
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,600
even breed to that uh there's no need

309
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,320
for that you said something in here is

310
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,360
there a way to breed out the interex

311
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:22,560
gene um why just skip it don't even do

312
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:24,079
it uh just skip that trait altogether

313
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:26,159
but what needs to happen is better

314
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:28,519
testing before these plants are bred

315
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:30,958
with you did not have two female plants

316
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:33,039
you did not have a solid female on both

317
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:35,319
sides because the breeding somewhere

318
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:38,278
introduced a hermaphroditic plant and

319
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:39,639
that is showing up again so the only way

320
00:11:38,278 --> 00:11:42,240
I can explain this I've been trying to

321
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:43,919
find a good way to explain the Herm

322
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:47,680
trait and breeding the best way that I

323
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:50,278
can explain this is if you use any

324
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:51,799
interex plants in your breeding imagine

325
00:11:50,278 --> 00:11:54,958
I'm going to take this a weird Direction

326
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:56,519
imagine we are making um a giant cake

327
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:58,319
there's a party coming up it's almost my

328
00:11:56,519 --> 00:12:00,078
birthday just bringing that up as the

329
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,240
the reason why're we're making a cake my

330
00:12:00,078 --> 00:12:04,000
birthday is coming up we're going to

331
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:05,839
make a gigantic cake right but for some

332
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,159
reason we're going to put we're going to

333
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:09,440
call the hermaphroditic trait poison we

334
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:11,719
know it's in there just going to

335
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,040
sprinkle some poison in my birthday cake

336
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,600
then we're going to stir it all up and

337
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:16,958
we're going to put it in the oven we

338
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:19,278
don't know where that poison went in the

339
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:21,119
cake all the poison could be all at this

340
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:22,919
end of the cake all the poison could be

341
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,320
at this end of the cake the poison could

342
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:26,399
be sprinkled out a little bit here and

343
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,399
there or it could be evenly uh spread

344
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,440
out homogeneous through the entire cake

345
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:32,000
I don't know where that poison went

346
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:34,560
that's exactly how I feel when you're

347
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,879
breeding with inter sex traits in your

348
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:38,078
breeding program there's poison in there

349
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:39,480
we don't know where it's going to show

350
00:12:38,078 --> 00:12:40,719
up we don't know how long it's going to

351
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,680
take to show up we don't know how much

352
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,440
of it got spread around we don't know if

353
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:46,638
it's all at this end we don't know all

354
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:48,680
of the poison went to this end but we do

355
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,079
know that it's in there so why do you

356
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:51,439
even want to mess with it I don't want

357
00:12:50,078 --> 00:12:53,078
any of the cake because I know there's

358
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,279
poison in that cake I'm going to go

359
00:12:53,078 --> 00:12:57,439
somewhere else and get poison free cake

360
00:12:55,278 --> 00:12:59,278
which would be a nonin seex plant which

361
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,800
would be a better bread line from a

362
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:03,600
breeder that paid more attention this

363
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:05,039
line uh wasn't tested uh intersect

364
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,519
traits are going to happen I can't say

365
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:09,679
that this wasn't tested um interex is

366
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,639
going to happen science nature they get

367
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:13,519
together they find a way I call it the

368
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:15,639
Jurassic Park Theory James Bean also

369
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:17,799
calls it the Jurassic Park Theory uh

370
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:19,639
life will find a way uh life will

371
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:21,919
continue the Cannabis plant's number one

372
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:23,399
goal we like to think we like to act

373
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:25,240
like we like to be egotistical and

374
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:27,120
arrogant and believe that this plant is

375
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:29,240
here to get us high and heal all of our

376
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,839
ailments but guess what the is not

377
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:33,240
thinking about that at all the plant's

378
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:35,000
number one purpose in life is to

379
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:37,039
reproduce just like you and me it just

380
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,919
wants to reproduce all day long it's all

381
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:41,240
it's thinking about it's why the male

382
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:42,879
plants get taller uh the female plants

383
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:44,799
stay lower so you can drop that pollen

384
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:46,439
onto them uh it's why he takes off a

385
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:48,838
little bit sooner but the number one

386
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:50,199
purpose of that plant is to reproduce so

387
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:52,160
you're going to find hermaphroditic

388
00:13:50,198 --> 00:13:54,919
traits uh that's just going to happen

389
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:58,000
occasionally um it will happen it's not

390
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:59,439
it's not 100% preventable but uh in my

391
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,759
breeding what what I'm saying is I

392
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,240
thoroughly test my plants my every plant

393
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:05,480
that goes into my breeding program is

394
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:07,079
stress tested it's abused we do some

395
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:10,159
damage to it we do some light testing

396
00:14:07,078 --> 00:14:12,000
some feed testing uh hot cold climate

397
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:13,240
changes we we run it through the ringer

398
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,720
I used to have a bunch of commercial

399
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,360
facilities where we could really abuse

400
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,839
these plants now you got to do it on

401
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:20,720
smaller areas but I abuse the [ __ ] out

402
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:22,399
of them if they show me interex traits

403
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,639
they don't get bred with that's why my

404
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:26,958
feminized seeds are reliable and we

405
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,159
don't see uh you don't hear any reports

406
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:30,439
you don't see it on the internet people

407
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:32,600
are not saying I has Herms because I'm

408
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:34,040
doing my due diligence and my work and

409
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,519
it sounds like I don't know who these

410
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:36,719
seeds came from I don't know where you

411
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,759
got these seeds or what this

412
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,160
hypothetical question derived from but

413
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:43,120
this breeder it sounds like that you're

414
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:45,000
hypothetically creating may not have

415
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,600
done the work may not have done the due

416
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,639
diligence to make sure that those plants

417
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:50,639
were not intersex plants before they

418
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,159
went into the breeding room let me read

419
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,079
the question again because I got rambly

420
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:56,759
I got way off topic on the in my head

421
00:14:54,078 --> 00:14:58,919
here if a feminized plant went inter sex

422
00:14:56,759 --> 00:15:00,759
so it's a female plant that came from a

423
00:14:58,919 --> 00:15:03,278
fem seed when intersect pollinated

424
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:04,879
another girl those seeds will not be fem

425
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:08,078
because it was a a Herm plant that

426
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:09,198
pollinated them so um and that's another

427
00:15:08,078 --> 00:15:11,559
I'm going to say that's another one of

428
00:15:09,198 --> 00:15:14,198
my freaking pet peeves it drives me

429
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:17,439
crazy when people say that a Herm plant

430
00:15:14,198 --> 00:15:19,359
will make F I want to know how does that

431
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,079
work it's like just like I explained

432
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,759
there's poison in there poison is going

433
00:15:21,078 --> 00:15:25,198
to come out if you breed if if the one

434
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:26,480
plant tastes like strawberries and one

435
00:15:25,198 --> 00:15:27,439
tastes like chocolate and you breed it

436
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,800
you're going to get chocolate and

437
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:32,160
strawberry if one of is a Herm why

438
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:34,479
wouldn't the Herm pass right along how

439
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:36,719
is a Herm going to make fem that's what

440
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:40,240
I want to know it's one of my major pet

441
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:42,199
