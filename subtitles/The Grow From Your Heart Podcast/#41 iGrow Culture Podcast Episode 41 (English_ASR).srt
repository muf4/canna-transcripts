confused sorry I'm not good with

72
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:44,158
remembering that many goddamn numbers

73
00:02:42,158 --> 00:02:45,280
they mess with my brain but that I have

74
00:02:44,158 --> 00:02:47,039
a good feeling about that I've heard a

75
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,120
lot of good stuff uh they gave it to me

76
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:50,239
because they know I'm going to kick ass

77
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,400
with it and see what it does yeah I

78
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,560
probably should have asked before I

79
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,080

little tiny miniature cakes like his

256
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:32,959
Phase 2 over there that was I mean maybe

257

the table not even that not 3 Ines maybe

260
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:42,959
two and a half um but compared to what

261
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:45,000
we have here locally in town you know it

262
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:46,879

selection they just had [ __ ] crammed in

264
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:51,519
cases like they barely had room you know

265
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,120
but there was definitely selection and

266
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:56,399
uh anything that you could imagine so it

267
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:58,720
was definitely a cool place uh met a

268
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:01,958
friendly dude in there that was you know

269
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:05,240

right you know he didn't really have

273
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:10,759
anything to do with the store though so

274
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:12,320
don't go expecting some okay well I

275
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:13,919
didn't know if he had anything he was

276
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,440
just hanging out there throwing people

277
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:17,159
his customer yeah he was just a customer

278
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,880
trying to be social I've never known any

279
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:21,639
place that can fix a a a broken piece

280
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:24,078
before you break a piece it's gone say

281
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:26,399
goodbye bury that sucker and this looks

282
00:09:24,078 --> 00:09:28,078
brand new people so you might be able to

283
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,120
save it I don't know if I got a hookup

284
00:09:28,078 --> 00:09:31,359
or anything cuz they kind of I've been

285
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,078
in there a little bit but the price they

286
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,839
charged me I was blown away at how cheap

287
00:09:33,078 --> 00:09:37,799
it was as far as I'm concerned it's a

288
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:39,240
miracle they made me drop I didn't know

289
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:42,199
this was a thing before they made me

290
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:44,240
drop a deposit on it which was cheap but

291
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:46,040
whatever and then you pay the deposit to

292
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,919
have it repaired they repair it and if

293
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:49,879
they break it when it's getting repaired

294
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:52,519
you get uh 30% off the rig of your

295
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:53,799
choice in the store oh nice yeah my

296
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:55,320
voice will come back I sound weird cuz I

297
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:58,000
just took a dab I'm all choked up trying

298
00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:00,160
to get this dab going for Adam so um it

299
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,399
was wider here correct and now it's

300
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:04,360
thinner right there like that before it

301
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,519
tapered just like that yeah it looks

302
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:08,440
like they cut it off right at the top of

303
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:10,320
cuz I broke it right where the new joint

304
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:12,360
the line is I broke it right the old one

305
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,879
broke right there anyway so they just

306
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,839
clean it up and put a new one on nice

307
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:18,000
and

308
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:19,399
clean that one you and then I guess that

309
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,958
a dab for Mike Mike's gonna cough

310

this set aside for a little while

322
00:10:49,078 --> 00:10:53,879
there's a reason uh I had some of the

323
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:56,720
sour grapes and it

324

radio host that is a face for radio sir

351
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,079
all right let's bring this meeting to

352
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:02,319
order all

353
00:12:00,078 --> 00:12:03,958
right um so we talked a little bit about

354
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,560
the meeting Mike was kind enough to show

355
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:07,599
up to the grow meeting hosted by H gr

356
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:10,039
indoor growing supplies last night it

357
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,720
was awesome it's funny I got a text it

358
00:12:10,039 --> 00:12:13,159
said I ate too much and I can't move and

359
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,600
they're supposed to bring me food so I

360
00:12:13,159 --> 00:12:17,439
wonder if that means that I'm not

361
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:21,480
getting food it was a good time uh it

362
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:24,320
was more mingle than uh than lesson time

363
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:26,839
yeah but uh I liked that it was nice uh

364
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,040
the lesson was I think I I realized

365
00:12:26,839 --> 00:12:29,839
about halfway through that most of us

366
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:32,278
were probably able to do everything that

367
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:34,839
Jesse was teaching but I'm glad he took

368
00:12:32,278 --> 00:12:37,399
that as his first teaching opportunity

369
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:39,839
because he's good now dude he's learning

370
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:41,198
and he's catching up being on this

371
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,959
podcast has really made him a better

372
00:12:41,198 --> 00:12:44,519
speaker so now he's able to do that I

373
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:46,359
think the next couple of lessons Jesse

374
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:48,919
is going to really crush it I picked a

375
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:50,600
bad spot like my if I tried to watch

376
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:53,519
Jesse while he was talking I would have

377
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:56,920
been watching his back so I was watching

378
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:59,759
everyone else Watch Jesse and he I mean

379
00:12:56,919 --> 00:13:01,799
cloning isn't complicated but but he

380
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:04,039
went over all the steps real quick and

381
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:06,439
at one point everybody in the room

382
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:09,559
pretty much went oh

383
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:11,480
yeah and took a second to pull their

384
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:13,879
phone out or grab a pen and jot down a

385
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:15,959
little note like I should use this

386
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:18,919
product or I'm keeping it too wet or too

387
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:20,599
dry or over underwatering or I mean just

388
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:23,319
little simple stuff yeah it was

389
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:24,839
definitely the little talk afterward the

390
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:26,199
fine tuning talk about oh you're

391
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:27,000
probably overwatering if that's what

392
00:13:26,198 --> 00:13:28,399
you're doing you're probably

393
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,879
underwatering that's what was cool

394
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:31,639
that's what was really valuable after

395
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:34,078
that but dude Jesse did a really good

396
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:35,519

00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,879
since it was no heat it works perfectly

442
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,759
so far we like doing it at the store

443
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:08,360
because then I talk about a product and

444
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:09,759
I can run down the hallway and grab it

445
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:11,399
be like this is what it looks like a

446
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:13,919
whole bunch of people left with stuff

447
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:15,559

what we're doing this isn't our Forte we

461
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,399
just decided that it needed to be Jesse

462
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,839
deci I'm taking credit for nothing uh

463
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:41,399
Jesse did all of this uh he decided that

464
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:42,600
this needed to happen so he's learning

465
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:44,078
and I'm helping him learn you know it's

466

won't get hung until December I've got a

512
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:20,798
crop that's growing in the room where

513
00:17:18,679 --> 00:17:22,240
that will go and when that crop finishes

514
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:24,759
that light will go up and it will start

515
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:27,279
under there and if it kicks as much ass

516
00:17:24,759 --> 00:17:29,879
as it appear if it you know as it looks

517
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:32,519
you'll be in the shot three more of them

518
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:34,640
here come March I'll buy four or five

519
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:36,440
more my only concern is venting those

520
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,120
don't match up with my venting style so

521
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:40,320
I can only run those in the winter very

522
00:17:38,119 --> 00:17:41,839
true but I can you know if they kick as

523
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:43,599
much ass as people have been saying I

524
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:45,798
can readjust my rooms all I have to do

525
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:47,159
is change air conditioning right just

526
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:49,000
got to change up a little bit couldn't

527
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:52,320
you just shorten the pipes and kind of

528
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,759
duct out from the main room from top and

529
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:56,678
filter into the bottom you know cool air

530
00:17:54,759 --> 00:17:58,440
in hot air out but the lights I'm

531
00:17:56,679 --> 00:17:59,840
running now are ducted so the heat from

532
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,240
the lights I'm running now doesn't ever

533
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:03,918
make it to the room and those are not

534
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:06,919
ducted it's the only only downside that

535
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:08,720
I'm seeing right now but the all one

536
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:11,320
unit which I've never seen before the

537
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,400
ballast and the the light is all usually

538
00:18:11,319 --> 00:18:15,359
separate and this is all one solid

539
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,798
really wellb built unit at least it

540
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:18,639
looks like it's well built it's much

541
00:18:16,798 --> 00:18:20,759
lighter than it looks also it looks like

542
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,280
it's heavy as hell but it's really light

543
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:24,519

that to be Las Vegas you think uh no I

607
00:20:39,079 --> 00:20:42,678
don't think about December 15th is

608
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:43,798
because that's around when he'll be back

609
00:20:42,679 --> 00:20:45,120

610
00:20:43,798 --> 00:20:46,720
being hypothetical here but the second

611
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:47,879
week of December maybe the beginning of

612
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,240
the third week of December you think

613
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:52,200
right here in Mike's chair you think

614
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:54,440
we'll have the secret Cup winner Garden

615
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,960

616
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:57,400
sitting right next to us right here if

617
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:59,440
you do can I be in the chair that's

618
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:01,679
behind the dab stuff you can I'll just

619
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,798
sit in the corner and be quiet the chair

620
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:05,320
with no mic guys there's a chair that

621
00:21:03,798 --> 00:21:06,879
sometimes people sit in and there's no

622
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:09,839
mic the mic sits right here next to me I

623
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:12,039
could fire this mic up but it's it's got

624
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:14,000
a droopy stand from what I understand it

625
00:21:12,038 --> 00:21:15,400
does but I I've got a replacement we

626
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,519
just that's sometimes people don't want

627
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,000
to be heard and they just sit here and

628
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:20,839
dish out dabs and just sit on the

629

00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:50,158
conversation and a lesson and you should

646
00:21:48,759 --> 00:21:51,798
probably fast forward through the rest

647
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:54,278
of this show because tonight is not our

648
00:21:51,798 --> 00:21:55,918
flow just skip episode 12 that's kind of

649
00:21:54,278 --> 00:21:57,240
how it felt we pulled it off eventually

650
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,640
through the magic of editing and a lot

651
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:01,200
of dabs right

652
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:03,000
throw some more shatter at the problem

653
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,400
and gets I don't even I don't even want

654
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,200
to talk about where it went it just went

655
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:09,000

in everything you need to know into just

679
00:22:54,798 --> 00:22:58,679
a little paragraph or two guys this may

680
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,319
be local news for most of what we're

681
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:02,278
doing here this is for this is happening

682
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:06,158
in my town and in my County so this is

683
00:23:02,278 --> 00:23:07,798
very pertinent to me uh I'm a grower um

684
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:09,559
I've got a home grow I grow my personal

685
00:23:07,798 --> 00:23:11,319
medicine here in my house I do some

686
00:23:09,558 --> 00:23:13,918
small stuff in my home because that's

687
00:23:11,319 --> 00:23:16,759
what we do it's Colorado not everything

688
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:18,759
has to happen in a large facility I am I

689
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:20,839
am Mike's medical marijuana provider and

690
00:23:18,759 --> 00:23:23,960
his caregiver so what's happening

691
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:25,879
pertains to Mike uh in a very real way

692
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:28,679
they're trying to enforce rules upon me

693
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:31,400
and my grow that will

694
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:32,720
uh it's going to it's going to [ __ ] with

695
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:34,240
Mike's medicine Supply I've been trying

696
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,798
to find a classier way to say that but

697
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,519
it's going to hinder my production of

698
00:23:35,798 --> 00:23:39,839
Mike's Quality medicine and Mike relies

699
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:41,079
on me for medicine so Mike is going to

700
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:42,519
city council I keep cutting you off but

701
00:23:41,079 --> 00:23:43,960
I'm setting you up good Mike is going to

702
00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:46,158
city council to make sure this doesn't

703
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:47,880
happen so this is super important to me

704
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:49,200
this [ __ ] could happen in your area and

705
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,640
someone's got to stand up and do what

706
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,200
Mike does so if you're doing that I give

707
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,480
you a huge shout out I'm going to turn

708
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,720
it over to mic for a couple minutes tell

709
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:56,640
me what you learned at city council

710
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,919
recently all right uh so down here in

711
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:01,278
Pablo Colorado there're looking at

712
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:03,320
passing hom grow rules in the city and

713
00:24:01,278 --> 00:24:04,960
in the county it's two very separate

714
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:07,359
efforts you have to go to two very

715
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:11,640
separate meetings to be involved with

716
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:13,479
this process right now um the planning

717
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:16,038
and zoning department with the city has

718
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:18,120
finalized their proposal they're sending

719
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:21,158
that recommendation on to city council

720
00:24:18,119 --> 00:24:22,918
city council will receive it I expect

721
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:25,679
that to happen at their first meeting in

722
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:27,399
December that's December 8th and then

723
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:30,960
their final meeting in December on

724
00:24:27,398 --> 00:24:32,759
December 26 second they'll be taking or

725
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:36,519
they'll likely be taking public comment

726
00:24:32,759 --> 00:24:38,079
and a vote on these proposed hir rules

727
00:24:36,519 --> 00:24:40,679
that will essentially limit every

728
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:43,879
caregiver in peblo they're really really

729
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:47,519
ugly rules folks you want to get down in

730
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:50,000
uh down to City Council on the 22nd and

731
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:52,639
speak out against these rules for sure

732
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,720
they're also out in the county that

733
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:58,159
meeting is going to be taking place on

734
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:59,839
December 10th at 9:00 a.m. so that what

735
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:01,399
that meetings a little bit closer mark

736
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:03,798

local peblo cannabis law news check out

739
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:11,678
PUO for sensible cannabis laws on

740
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:14,360
Facebook I'm trying to post this stuff

741
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:16,480
up as fast as I can but getting digital

742
00:25:14,359 --> 00:25:18,079
copy copies of the ordinances that I can

743
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,159
easily post to Facebook has been a

744
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:22,038
little tricky but info about the

745
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:24,080
meetings and what you can do to help out

746
00:25:22,038 --> 00:25:25,119
is uh that's the best place to look

747
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:26,000
right now if you're looking for that

748
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:29,719
kind of

749
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:33,480
info and that's essentially it folks

750
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:35,759
um and this is just mainly on caregivers

751
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:38,558
it's the rules are going to in the city

752
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:40,158
and the county rules are different um

753
00:25:38,558 --> 00:25:42,720
this is an extension of what you already

754
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:44,840
went to okay I'll I'll definitely go for

755
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,519
sure uh anything you need support on

756
00:25:44,839 --> 00:25:48,319
brother the rules as they stand right

757
00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:51,158
now there's a whole lot of them they

758
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:52,918
don't make a whole lot of sense um I'm

759
00:25:51,159 --> 00:25:54,240
doing a whole bunch of private lobbying

760
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:55,720
trying to stop them can you tell me an

761
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,759
example of a couple of the stupid rules

762
00:25:55,720 --> 00:26:00,079
they're trying to put out they're

763
00:25:56,759 --> 00:26:01,960
banning all CO2 usage in any sort of

764
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:04,519
marijuana grow room but the way they

765
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:06,960
write that rule I mean it's dumb just on

766
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:08,798
its face but the way it's written would

767
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,679
make it illegal to take the soda stream

768
00:26:08,798 --> 00:26:12,839
machine I have in my kitchen into a grow

769
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:15,000
room and use it like that's a special

770
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:16,519
new crime now I'm glad you grabbed that

771
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,119
one right away that's a rule that I find

772
00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:21,918
ridiculous because there are people that

773
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:24,759
the CO2 he's talking about CO2 for CO2

774
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:27,399
augmentation we run CO2 and Grow rooms

775
00:26:24,759 --> 00:26:28,960
uh because the CO2 plants would Thrive

776
00:26:27,398 --> 00:26:30,599
with more CO2 than what's naturally

777
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,600
available in the atmosphere in your

778
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:34,918
natural grow you're probably have about

779
00:26:32,599 --> 00:26:37,558
3 to 500 probably right around 400

780
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:40,159
particles per million of CO2 yep if you

781
00:26:37,558 --> 00:26:42,158
go to the hydro shop they'll set you up

782
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:43,320
with a system where you can get about it

783
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:46,559
would be cool if you could get about

784
00:26:43,319 --> 00:26:47,918
1,200 to 1800 ppms of CO2 in the room

785
00:26:46,558 --> 00:26:50,079
what that does is your plants breathe

786
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:51,720
that and they grow much more vigorously

787
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:53,759
you get bigger buds you get denser buds

788
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,798
you get larger plants and it makes them

789
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:58,440
grow more

790
00:26:54,798 --> 00:27:01,599
quickly so tomato Growers use this all

791
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:04,480
kinds of indoor plant Growers use Co

792
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:06,199
Hydroponic and all of these rules are

793
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,200
written so that they could easily be

794
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:10,640
applied to anybody doing the same thing

795
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:12,519
with something that's not cannabis but

796
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,360
it's all cannabis specific so they don't

797
00:27:12,519 --> 00:27:17,319
make a lot of sense hopefully the city

798
00:27:14,359 --> 00:27:19,639
council will see how much nonsense this

799
00:27:17,319 --> 00:27:21,200
is and kill it on and send the whole

800
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:22,960
matter back to Planning and Zoning for a

801
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,798
redo but I just think it's dumb that

802
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,399
they pick out CO2 because the Tomato

803
00:27:24,798 --> 00:27:27,639
farmer can go to the hydro shop and buy

804
00:27:26,398 --> 00:27:29,599
it and take it to his house and run it

805
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:30,799
in the basement just like just like Adam

806
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:32,519
would in his basement grow just like

807
00:27:30,798 --> 00:27:35,319
Mike would in his basement grow just

808
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:38,200
like a lot of the rules is someone grow

809
00:27:35,319 --> 00:27:40,439
they heard something that sounded scary

810
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:42,960
and so they wrote a rule that says you

811
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:44,440
can't do that and because they don't

812
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,200
know what they're talking about and the

813
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:48,038
research didn't get done a lot of the

814
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:50,440
rules don't make sense I mean I've

815
00:27:48,038 --> 00:27:52,480
described it to other people as like

816
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:54,759
listening to a 5-year-old lecture on

817
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:57,399
calculus it doesn't matter how much

818
00:27:54,759 --> 00:27:59,879
homework they did the night before like

819
00:27:57,398 --> 00:28:01,959
the the will be total nonsense from

820
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:04,760
start to finish and anyone not throwing

821
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:06,880
rocks is doing so out of being polite

822
00:28:04,759 --> 00:28:10,398
like well it's just painful to watch the

823
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:14,159
last time we went two of the council at

824
00:28:10,398 --> 00:28:16,639
least seemed to be I won't say proot but

825
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:19,000
not against it definitely like I

826
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:21,720
wouldn't say anyone on Council is proot

827
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,960
but there are some that are interested

828
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:26,000
in what legal that's only two out of the

829
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:27,798
five you know you're still they's still

830
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,759
the minority of the vote it's an uphill

831
00:28:27,798 --> 00:28:31,398
climb for sure which is why I I keep

832
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:33,278
bringing it up on this podcast cuz

833
00:28:31,398 --> 00:28:35,839
people need to show up to these meetings

834
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:38,679
and start pitching in if Planning and

835
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:41,359
Zoning work on the marijuana rules is

836
00:28:38,679 --> 00:28:43,120
indicative of their work on other rules

837
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:45,439
that might be an explanation into why

838
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:46,798
nothing works here like it might just be

839
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,080
that nobody's paid attention to

840
00:28:46,798 --> 00:28:51,599
government for so long that no like they

841
00:28:49,079 --> 00:28:53,960
don't expect to get caught just doing

842
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:55,959
nonsense a lot of people aren't aware

843
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:58,440
that we can just go to city council and

844
00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:01,038
sign up and sit at that little cozy with

845
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:02,759
a microphone dude it's cushy it feels

846
00:29:01,038 --> 00:29:04,079
they make they kind of it's intimidating

847
00:29:02,759 --> 00:29:06,158
if you're not that kind of person but

848
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:08,278
the one the first time you go I feel

849
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:10,039
like I could go now if I had some real

850
00:29:08,278 --> 00:29:12,558
business to go deal with I could I could

851
00:29:10,038 --> 00:29:14,839
go speak there it's inviting anybody can

852
00:29:12,558 --> 00:29:16,158
go you can go totally right now right

853
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:17,839
now Adam looks like a homeless person

854
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:19,360
with headphones on absolutely he's

855
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:20,959
wearing an iy genetic hoodie that could

856
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:22,558
use a wash probably he's got some

857
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,600
dreadlocks that are the same as the

858
00:29:22,558 --> 00:29:26,038
hoodie they definitely could use a wash

859
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:27,319
he's got a tore up green t-shirt under

860
00:29:26,038 --> 00:29:29,319
there I can't see his pants but his

861
00:29:27,319 --> 00:29:31,079
shoes are definitely muddy as crap and

862
00:29:29,319 --> 00:29:32,798
with holes in the bottom of them so but

863
00:29:31,079 --> 00:29:34,558
dude you're invited to go talk at city

864
00:29:32,798 --> 00:29:35,759
council you can speak and nobody will

865
00:29:34,558 --> 00:29:38,000
judge you they'll listen to what you

866
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:39,879
have to say they may judge you I'm I'm

867
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,480
lying I saw them definitely

868
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,840
condescendingly judge one person for a

869
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:45,319
few minutes and it was almost

870
00:29:42,839 --> 00:29:47,240
entertaining but uh you can go speak and

871
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:49,839
you can say your peace and you get I

872
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:51,839
think five full solid minutes and they

873
00:29:49,839 --> 00:29:53,720
six I believe during public comment they

874
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:55,599
give anyone who wants to come and sign

875
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:57,159
up five full minutes to speak on

876
00:29:55,599 --> 00:29:59,000
anything they'd like to and this happens

877
00:29:57,159 --> 00:30:00,679
in every city if you've got a city hall

878
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,798
that has City Council meetings you can

879
00:30:00,679 --> 00:30:05,000
go and you can even if it's something

880
00:30:02,798 --> 00:30:08,240
that one guy came and talked for 6

881
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:10,200
minutes about the bike Lane right and

882
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,359
how to use them yeah I was going to say

883
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,960
it felt like he was giving the city

884
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:14,599
council a lesson on how to use bike

885
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,480
Lanes but I think he was asking for more

886
00:30:14,599 --> 00:30:19,359
funding to create more bike Lanes was

887
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:22,159
his goal information on how to use bike

888
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:24,678
Lanes in these meetings are p p or

889
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:27,440
broadcast free to the public on like

890
00:30:24,679 --> 00:30:29,480
Channel 16 or 17 here locally and so

891
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,720
he's trying to show the city how to use

892
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:33,599
these new bike lanes and this is just he

893
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:36,399
found out a free way to get on TV and

894
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:38,439
give a a little educational SP on bike L

895
00:30:36,398 --> 00:30:40,439
and you did it if you guys are against

896
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:42,360
something that's going or if you need

897
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:43,558
something that isn't happening to happen

898
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:46,359
if you if you're not getting some good

899
00:30:43,558 --> 00:30:47,678
recycling in your city uh go to city

900
00:30:46,359 --> 00:30:49,079
council and be like hey we've got a lot

901
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,600
of trash we should work on some

902
00:30:49,079 --> 00:30:52,639
recycling if that's your P do whatever

903
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:53,959
your passion is our passion is cannabis

904
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,799
so we're going to city council and we're

905
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:57,120
saying cannabis a lot there's a young

906
00:30:55,798 --> 00:31:00,240
woman who comes down and speaks on

907
00:30:57,119 --> 00:31:02,038
roadside Memorial all the time and I

908
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,120
mean half the room's in tears every time

909
00:31:02,038 --> 00:31:06,960
she speaks and I'll give you 30 seconds

910
00:31:04,119 --> 00:31:09,000
are you or are you for against roadside

911
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,440
memorials I honestly don't care you

912
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,720
don't care well that was a quick 30

913
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:16,840
seconds Adam you know me I don't care I

914
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:18,200
could are they trash or are they oh no

915
00:31:16,839 --> 00:31:19,759
no no no and I definitely wouldn't walk

916
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:22,038
by and kick one you know I'm not that

917
00:31:19,759 --> 00:31:25,278
kind of an [ __ ] but it to me it's a

918
00:31:22,038 --> 00:31:29,480
something that I I to me no one's been

919
00:31:25,278 --> 00:31:31,200
lost so it's hard for me to really YN

920
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:32,880
every culture has a Way They Mourn and I

921
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,880
don't just because I don't understand it

922
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:37,159
doesn't mean they shouldn't do it but

923
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:39,440
they're everywhere down here it's kind

924
00:31:37,159 --> 00:31:41,000
of intense and it it I don't know

925
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,240
driving around and not being used to

926
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,079
roadside memorials because it's not

927
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,440
something you see all the time in Denver

928
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:47,599
even though people have died on every

929
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,919
street corner in Denver too somebody

930
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:50,038
somebody's probably dying on a street

931
00:31:48,919 --> 00:31:51,159
corner in Denver while we're talking

932
00:31:50,038 --> 00:31:52,599
about this probably several all right

933
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:54,760

the I've got the internet though locally

940
00:32:04,599 --> 00:32:08,879
don't expect to vote for our president

941
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:11,239
and he's going to change cannabis laws

942

943
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:17,679

cannabis um cannabis Pro cannabis and

945
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:22,080
then you work from your city council to

946
00:32:20,119 --> 00:32:24,678
your mayor and you try to get that dude

947
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:27,678
in office that's the way Colorado did it

948
00:32:24,679 --> 00:32:29,278
it didn't start it started in Denver and

949
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:31,559
they decriminalized it and it worked

950
00:32:29,278 --> 00:32:34,720
outwards am I I mean this is just what I

951
00:32:31,558 --> 00:32:36,398
know from looking outside you with

952
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,079
anything political you definitely start

953
00:32:36,398 --> 00:32:39,439
local that's where you generate your

954
00:32:38,079 --> 00:32:40,759
base and your support and that's what

955
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,759
they're talking about when they say

956
00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:44,720
Grassroots political effort is going

957
00:32:42,759 --> 00:32:46,038
door too and saying hey stranger what do

958
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,600
you think about cannabis laws or

959
00:32:46,038 --> 00:32:49,359
whatever you're passionate about and

960
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:50,918
there's tons of that here I mean a lot

961
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:52,678
of people on a national level that think

962
00:32:50,919 --> 00:32:54,840
at Colorado and they think they've

963
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:56,960
legalized medical marijuana years and

964
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:59,599
years ago they legalized recreational

965
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:04,480

Mike worked with me I was Mike's boss at

977
00:33:26,919 --> 00:33:30,880

978
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:33,200
sold medical cannabis over the counter

979
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:35,440
for months and I'm well known for that

980
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,240
around here the first timer Bliss is

981
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:39,278
just something so fun to watch yeah I

982
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:41,558
walked out of that dispensary in January

983
00:33:39,278 --> 00:33:42,960
1st after I was the first person to buy

984
00:33:41,558 --> 00:33:45,519
recreational Cannabis at the greeners

985
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:47,200
side dispensary in PUO Colorado when I

986
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:48,440
walked out I've said that so many times

987
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,200
when I walked out of that dispensary I

988
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:51,320
was like there was a camera guy there

989
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:53,080
and he goes hey man we're doing a

990
00:33:51,319 --> 00:33:54,480
documentary can you tell us some can you

991
00:33:53,079 --> 00:33:55,720
say something good when you walk out and

992
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,000
I was like cool watch this and I went

993
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:58,960
right back in the door and I came back

994
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,278
out and I threw my arms up in the air

995
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,120
and I yelled just that I go my name is

996
00:34:00,278 --> 00:34:03,599
rosta Jeff and I was the first person to

997
00:34:02,119 --> 00:34:05,199
buy recreational Cannabis at the

998
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:07,759
greeners side dispensary in Pueblo

999
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:10,039
Colorado and then I screamed

1000
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:12,679
wow and that guy looked at me like that

1001
00:34:10,039 --> 00:34:15,079
was [ __ ] amazing like that was

1002
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:18,599
exactly what he needed for his film so

1003
00:34:15,079 --> 00:34:20,399
be found that rep inter filmed stuff

1004
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:23,119
that they're going to use every couple

1005
00:34:20,398 --> 00:34:25,480
of weeks for the next 100 years that day

1006
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:28,320
it's hilarious all right I just pulled

1007
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:30,320
up you were talking reading news so

1008
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:32,440
what what I was leading at is once

1009
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:34,359
Colorado legalized marijuana the fight

1010
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:38,119
quickly became cities and counties

1011
00:34:34,358 --> 00:34:40,159
looking for fun ways to ban it again so

1012
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:43,720
yeah in a very real way we won but in a

1013
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:46,200
very real way now we're making the rules

1014
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:48,118
drafting the path forward and you know

1015
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:51,118
the whole world's watching Colorado and

1016
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:54,079
peblo reports our tax numbers first so

1017
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:56,838
in a very real way our tiny little town

1018
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:59,839
and would you say we get a lot of Texas

1019
00:34:56,838 --> 00:35:02,078
traffic because like the first stop we

1020
00:34:59,838 --> 00:35:03,799
get a lot of every kind of traffic yeah

1021
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:06,640
all right pbl's on the way to the rest

1022
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:08,240
of the US from every place south of here

1023
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:10,159

1024
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:11,358
Trail I didn't know that major stop

1025

that things are evolving and that uh

1040
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:48,599
America is starting to make changes

1041
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:50,160
that's what I got from it so it's

1042
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:52,039
positive changes it says marijuana

1043
00:35:50,159 --> 00:35:54,239
activists are plan are already planning

1044
00:35:52,039 --> 00:35:56,440
the 2016 campaign to regulate and

1045
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:58,519
legalize the sale for recreational pot

1046
00:35:56,440 --> 00:36:00,639
in Nevada home to to Las Vegas one of

1047
00:35:58,519 --> 00:36:02,519
the world's biggest tourism

1048
00:36:00,639 --> 00:36:04,279
destinations but some tourists won't

1049
00:36:02,519 --> 00:36:06,400
have to wait that long to legally buy

1050
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:09,880
weed in Las Vegas thanks to the most

1051
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:13,079
legal reciprocity law in the US I nailed

1052
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:15,318
that word huh almost so close

1053
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:17,318
reciprocity we practiced this beforehand

1054
00:36:15,318 --> 00:36:19,880
it's a tricky word God damn it words are

1055
00:36:17,318 --> 00:36:22,440
hard I need another D I didn't know what

1056
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:23,440
it was so I had to Define it I I just

1057
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:25,280
didn't know how to say it I could read

1058
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:27,720
it like a champ I was like one my tongue

1059
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:29,359
is mad at that word homie all right well

1060
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:30,639
Mike just said it for me so I'm just GNA

1061
00:36:29,358 --> 00:36:32,119
point at Mike and he'll say that word

1062
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:33,639
every time it comes up from now on

1063
00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:35,200
awesome uh medical marijuana card

1064
00:36:33,639 --> 00:36:38,559
holders throughout the US will be able

1065
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:40,598
to purchase pot in Nevada starting in

1066
00:36:38,559 --> 00:36:42,480
2015 all they'll have to do is show

1067
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:44,640
their medical marijuana license show a

1068
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:46,559
government ID proving their 21 or older

1069
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:48,639
and sign an affidavit and they'll have

1070
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:51,199
access to that shop but no others for

1071
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:52,920
their stay in Nevada does that lead me

1072
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:54,960
to believe they only get one stop when

1073
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:57,079
they go to Nevada that sounds like you

1074
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:59,599
got to pick it and stick it homie huh

1075
00:36:57,079 --> 00:37:02,400
pick one stay with it but how much are

1076
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:03,960
you allowed to uh let me interesting so

1077
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:06,039
they're trying to prevent smurfing

1078
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:08,880
that's an odd way to do that but true

1079
00:37:06,039 --> 00:37:11,599
there you go uh will this liberal

1080
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:12,838
medical reciproc reciprocity I was

1081
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:15,200
wondering what the point was going to

1082
00:37:12,838 --> 00:37:18,639
look like yeah I just came up across the

1083
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:20,480
word uh reciprocity act as a act as a

1084
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:22,519
soft lead to recreational measures in

1085
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:25,480
Nevada and will NADA pass full-on

1086
00:37:22,519 --> 00:37:28,440
recreational legalization in 2016 of

1087
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:30,159
course it will said Jim Laro who handles

1088
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:32,079
government relations at Colorado based

1089
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:33,838
pot testing facility can labs which

1090
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:36,519
recently announced its future present in

1091
00:37:33,838 --> 00:37:38,519
Nevada's marijuana Market most people

1092
00:37:36,519 --> 00:37:40,679
are factoring into their

1093
00:37:38,519 --> 00:37:42,159
models oh he must not be able to say the

1094
00:37:40,679 --> 00:37:43,799
word either because he skipped it in his

1095
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:45,639
sentence and they put it in there

1096
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:47,599
parenthesis that's nice he can't say the

1097
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:48,960
word either nice we're the tri one no

1098
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:50,559
you're not alone there buddy all the

1099
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,800
applications that went in people

1100
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:54,358
discussed it as part of their model uh

1101
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,400
you can consider that Nevada has fewer

1102
00:37:54,358 --> 00:37:58,279
than 7,000 medical marijuana patients

1103
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,318
it's not a very large base but when you

1104
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:01,839
factor in MMJ patients from other states

1105
00:38:00,318 --> 00:38:05,519
who might take advantage of Nevada

1106
00:38:01,838 --> 00:38:09,199
system another 110,000 from Colorado

1107
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:11,199
570,000 from California and 100,000 from

1108
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:12,719
Washington suddenly those numbers are

1109
00:38:11,199 --> 00:38:15,480
looking a lot

1110
00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:16,879
better yeah not to mention if Missouri

1111
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:19,400
goes legal this year which they're

1112
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:21,838
talking about 2016 Michigan there's a

1113
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:23,920
couple several other medical marijuana

1114
00:38:21,838 --> 00:38:25,559
California is going to be trying to do

1115
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:28,079
legalization this year as well what

1116
00:38:25,559 --> 00:38:31,039
happened Florida

1117
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:33,560
58% is a pretty pretty good

1118
00:38:31,039 --> 00:38:34,880
number did we or did we not no it sucks

1119
00:38:33,559 --> 00:38:37,279
for those people that are

1120
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:39,318
SI it was pretty Fu did we or did we not

1121
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:41,440
talk about this and like you thought it

1122
00:38:39,318 --> 00:38:43,759
I don't trust Florida's government to

1123
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:46,119
like give them say oh okay here's here's

1124
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:48,040
a full medical bill you can't do

1125
00:38:46,119 --> 00:38:49,400
anything with it nothing can come in

1126
00:38:48,039 --> 00:38:52,440
nothing can go out it's got to be all

1127
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:55,318
CBD here in Florida because we just got

1128
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:58,159
such banging medicine like New Jersey

1129
00:38:55,318 --> 00:39:00,239
does and you I mean you

1130
00:38:58,159 --> 00:39:02,598
you were part of that kind of argument

1131
00:39:00,239 --> 00:39:05,479
the beginning and it I stuck with it

1132
00:39:02,599 --> 00:39:07,318
dude and I I'm sorry man I still was

1133
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:09,559
having all kinds of issues they they had

1134
00:39:07,318 --> 00:39:11,239
CBD only legislation before this recent

1135
00:39:09,559 --> 00:39:12,719
medical marijuana failure and right

1136
00:39:11,239 --> 00:39:16,159
after the medical marijuana Amendment

1137
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:18,759
fail the judge toss their CBD rules so

1138
00:39:16,159 --> 00:39:20,879
they're back to square [ __ ] sorry

1139
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:22,640
kids all right so this article says

1140
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,760
giving patients the ability to legal

1141
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:25,960
legally access medical marijuana when

1142
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:28,079
they're visiting a legal medical

1143
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:29,599
marijuana state just make sense said

1144
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:31,880
Taylor West deputy director of the

1145
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:33,318
national cannabis industry Association

1146
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:35,358
and National trade group for legal

1147
00:39:33,318 --> 00:39:36,639
marijuana businesses and it makes even

1148
00:39:35,358 --> 00:39:38,519
more sense when you're talking about a

1149
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:41,039
state that has such a huge number of out

1150
00:39:38,519 --> 00:39:43,519
of out of state visitors it's safe for

1151
00:39:41,039 --> 00:39:47,039
for patients and good for NE Nevada

1152
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:49,119
businesses win win yep that would that

1153
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:52,318
would almost be like Florida you know

1154
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:54,039
like if you went medical and would allow

1155
00:39:52,318 --> 00:39:55,480
other states to come in but there's no

1156
00:39:54,039 --> 00:39:57,759
that dispensary right by Disney World

1157
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:59,159
would crush

1158
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:01,400
I mean that's been the two downsides to

1159
00:39:59,159 --> 00:40:03,838
medical marijuana from the beginning is

1160
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:06,000
it's technically illegal and you can't

1161
00:40:03,838 --> 00:40:07,279
travel I mean if you're good in Colorado

1162
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,519
you're not good anywhere else if you're

1163
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:10,599
good in Washington you're not good

1164
00:40:08,519 --> 00:40:12,199
anywhere else yeah it's and now there's

1165
00:40:10,599 --> 00:40:14,000
some reciprocity and that's a beautiful

1166
00:40:12,199 --> 00:40:16,519
thing you'll see me in Vegas now and and

1167
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:19,119
I mean now look at all the events you

1168
00:40:16,519 --> 00:40:21,280
know it's secret Cup's going to be way

1169
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:25,400
bigger in 2015 that's all I'm

1170
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:27,880
saying no 500 tickets Max keep it small

1171
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:29,960
nice and private I I sweet agree with

1172
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:32,640
that sentiment but I'd be impressed if

1173
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:33,838
they keep it to 500 tickets keep sweet

1174
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:35,400
all right so check this out the article

1175
00:40:33,838 --> 00:40:37,400
goes on it says sure enough Vegas sees

1176
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:39,000
roughly 40 million visitors annually

1177
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:40,480
that's a lot of people but how many of

1178
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,880
those tourists will have valid medical

1179
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,199
marijuana cards and how many of those

1180
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:45,838
patients will take the time to seek

1181
00:40:43,199 --> 00:40:48,279
legal Nevada weed we're still talking

1182
00:40:45,838 --> 00:40:50,000
reg Rel relatively small numbers said

1183
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:52,640
Joe hodus Chief marketing officer at

1184
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,480
denver-based marijuana company Eddie uh

1185
00:40:52,639 --> 00:40:57,078
sorry I read that way too quickly Dixie

1186
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:59,039
Elixir it's h as if the it's not as if

1187
00:40:57,079 --> 00:41:01,160
the average tourist or consumer can show

1188
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:02,119
up and make a purchase the red card act

1189
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:03,879
won't have hey that's what they're

1190
00:41:02,119 --> 00:41:05,680
calling it won't have huge a huge impact

1191
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:07,559
on their tourism because it's a small

1192
00:41:05,679 --> 00:41:09,598
number of people many of whom were

1193
00:41:07,559 --> 00:41:11,318
probably already going to Vegas it might

1194
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:13,318
be a convenience but if I have a red

1195
00:41:11,318 --> 00:41:15,559
card I can already get my medicine in my

1196
00:41:13,318 --> 00:41:17,519
own State yeah but flying with it could

1197
00:41:15,559 --> 00:41:19,000
be sketchy sometimes yeah you can get it

1198
00:41:17,519 --> 00:41:21,358
in your own State you just can't take it

1199
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,679
with you to Vegas cuz you've got to fly

1200
00:41:21,358 --> 00:41:25,119
there or drive through Utah or New

1201
00:41:23,679 --> 00:41:26,519
Mexico to get there well now it sounds

1202
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:28,200
like you're legit so when you get there

1203
00:41:26,519 --> 00:41:30,119
you can have it

1204
00:41:28,199 --> 00:41:31,799
what happens when it becomes Under

1205
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:33,800
Pressure it it like explodes or

1206
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:37,680
something no no you're

1207
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:39,280
cool it's just the TSA telling us no oh

1208
00:41:37,679 --> 00:41:40,598
okay so everybody else can change their

1209
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,599
policies except for the people that

1210
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:44,079
transport everybody right pretty much oh

1211
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:45,800
okay all right so it says if Nevada does

1212
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:49,400
pass recreational marijuana measures in

1213
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:51,318
20 2016 the election in the 2016

1214
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:53,880
election the earliest the state will see

1215
00:41:51,318 --> 00:41:56,759
those sales starting is late 2017 but

1216
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:58,480
2018 is more likely until then companies

1217
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:00,119
such as Di pixie which hopes to soon

1218
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:02,159
have an agreement allowing the St the

1219
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:04,240
sale of its cannabis infused Edibles

1220
00:42:02,159 --> 00:42:05,799
drinks and topicals in Nevada will have

1221
00:42:04,239 --> 00:42:08,759
time to leave their mark on the Las

1222
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:12,440
Vegas Strip I was going to ask why two

1223
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:14,000
years but after seeing what um just

1224
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:16,280
happened in Washington where they're so

1225
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,039
unprepared for recreational I would

1226
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:19,599
almost expect two years to be right

1227
00:42:18,039 --> 00:42:21,800
about right you know give them time to

1228
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:24,680
grow some herb get the rules in

1229
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:27,920
place get a couple things in stock and

1230
00:42:24,679 --> 00:42:29,078
like cure it and it be

1231
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,280
that's a funny joke you think the

1232
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:34,599
dispensaries are going to cure some weed

1233
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:36,760
you're a funny guy har har harvested

1234
00:42:34,599 --> 00:42:38,760
derka derka all right derka derka so we

1235
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:40,880
didn't review either the film we watched

1236
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:42,720
that's where we're headed right now uh

1237
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:45,039
the next thing is so guys we bragged

1238
00:42:42,719 --> 00:42:46,399
about Adam and I bragged recently about

1239
00:42:45,039 --> 00:42:49,880
a couple months ago about going to see

1240
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:51,358
Joe Rogan I ain't shut up about it so

1241
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:52,800
now that I've seen the special I can see

1242
00:42:51,358 --> 00:42:55,199
why you didn't shut up about it I wish I

1243
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:57,318
was there yeah we saw Joe Angela myself

1244
00:42:55,199 --> 00:42:58,960
and Adam went and saw Joe Rogan live the

1245
00:42:57,318 --> 00:43:01,480
Denver Comedy Works during the taping of

1246
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:03,679

1249
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:10,880

1250
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:13,639
lady uh that was a funny damn comedy

1251

special they cut out a lot we were there

1252

they cut out a lot oh yeah that's what

1253
00:43:15,639 --> 00:43:20,159
you guys were saying last night it uh I

1254
00:43:17,559 --> 00:43:22,200
like the final product they put together

1255
00:43:20,159 --> 00:43:25,799
really I wish I had that quality of a

1256
00:43:22,199 --> 00:43:27,480
video camera uh the cameras were tiny uh

1257
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:29,039
the camera that Rogan is staring into

1258
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:31,039
the majority of the time I'm sitting

1259
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:35,480
under like a lot of the time it's a

1260
00:43:31,039 --> 00:43:37,719
small little thing like a a LED screen

1261
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:40,159
display basically and that's it nice so

1262
00:43:37,719 --> 00:43:42,919
it's it's cool it was a great comedy

1263
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:45,000
show he crushed it from beginning to end

1264
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:46,960
my I was laughing hard last night

1265
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:49,119
professional one I would say you know

1266
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:51,880
and that that was a good one to go to

1267
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:53,200
for sure um you hadn't gone you hadn't

1268
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:54,240
gone to another show at Comedy Works

1269
00:43:53,199 --> 00:43:56,118
before that I've never been to a

1270
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:59,159
professional comedy show like somebody

1271
00:43:56,119 --> 00:44:00,800
tvwise like big time you know I mean

1272
00:43:59,159 --> 00:44:02,598
I've done stuff here and I mean it's

1273
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:05,359
basically the same but there was a lot

1274
00:44:02,599 --> 00:44:07,318
more rules to that I mean that was a com

1275
00:44:05,358 --> 00:44:08,880
intense yeah that was and there were so

1276
00:44:07,318 --> 00:44:10,480
many crowd rules they were moving the

1277
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:12,079
crowd around and putting ugly people in

1278
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:13,280
the back and sexy people up front and of

1279
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:14,800
course we were under camera so you

1280
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:16,599
couldn't even see us it was sort of

1281
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:18,079
pointless I never saw a real good look

1282
00:44:16,599 --> 00:44:20,039
at anybody that's where I was headed

1283
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:21,720
with this it was really dark the only

1284
00:44:20,039 --> 00:44:23,000
lights in the building were on the stage

1285
00:44:21,719 --> 00:44:24,558
and you couldn't even see the crowd so

1286
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,519
all the moving around and all the rules

1287
00:44:24,559 --> 00:44:28,680
and the no hats and no logo [ __ ] was

1288
00:44:26,519 --> 00:44:30,440
just too much tension it might have

1289
00:44:28,679 --> 00:44:31,879
applied if he had a 20-minute bid on

1290
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:34,639
like picking on people in the front row

1291
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:36,880
or some [ __ ] but all I saw was the

1292
00:44:34,639 --> 00:44:38,558
profile of one kid a couple of times and

1293
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:40,760
that's pretty much all the crowd you see

1294
00:44:38,559 --> 00:44:42,240
and that's where we were for Doug Benson

1295
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:44,000
that's what I kept telling there three

1296
00:44:42,239 --> 00:44:46,159
seats off to the side up on the top and

1297
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:48,159
that's where nice yeah and see right

1298
00:44:46,159 --> 00:44:49,960
next to Jeff Jeff was basically

1299
00:44:48,159 --> 00:44:52,838
underneath the camera there was a guy

1300
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:55,039
sitting next to us but his uh it was

1301
00:44:52,838 --> 00:44:58,000
still wheelchair accessible so it wasn't

1302
00:44:55,039 --> 00:44:59,558
sloped um so he was up up higher so that

1303
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,480
every shot from across the way it

1304
00:44:59,559 --> 00:45:03,720
basically blocked us like completely out

1305
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:06,119
of there because we were underneath his

1306
00:45:03,719 --> 00:45:08,318
shoulders basically probably down to his

1307
00:45:06,119 --> 00:45:10,119
elbow yeah I know there's a way easier

1308
00:45:08,318 --> 00:45:11,920
way to get on TV just go to city council

1309

he was a cop for a whole bunch of um he

1378

was a murder detective for a whole bunch

1379
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:08,680
of years in Baltimore I believe yeah

1380

those dudes always have some stories man

1381
00:48:08,679 --> 00:48:15,000
like every time like and it's we have

1382
00:48:11,318 --> 00:48:16,480
more of them that come over to our side

1383
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,159
than they then you know like the

1384
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:19,519
druggies clean up and go to the cops

1385
00:48:18,159 --> 00:48:21,399
because for number one law enforcement

1386
00:48:19,519 --> 00:48:24,358
against prohibition is an awesome group

1387
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:27,480
that's full made up fully of EX judges

1388
00:48:24,358 --> 00:48:30,759
cops detectives DEA agents that just saw

1389
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:33,079
that prohibition doesn't do anything but

1390
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:34,760
harm and it might come from an

1391
00:48:33,079 --> 00:48:37,318
interesting place of trying to prevent

1392
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:39,640
drug use but it doesn't do that at all

1393
00:48:37,318 --> 00:48:41,719
and on top of not being effective at all

1394
00:48:39,639 --> 00:48:43,440
at its main goal it's also incredibly

1395
00:48:41,719 --> 00:48:46,598
harmful to the society it's you're

1396
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:48,880
attempting to try it in I'm I can I can

1397
00:48:46,599 --> 00:48:51,559
agree with that uh it also had clips

1398
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:54,280
from Joe Rogan we saw Snoop dizle we saw

1399
00:48:51,559 --> 00:48:55,480
Lester grinspoon uh Brian redband was in

1400
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:56,880

1401
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:58,960

1402
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:02,318

1406
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:08,440
yeah there's just I got attachments to

1407
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:10,039
all of them because you know just

1408
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:11,760
industry things I look up to a lot of

1409
00:49:10,039 --> 00:49:13,239
those people uh they actually show that

1410
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:15,000
cannabis scientifically they proved that

1411
00:49:13,239 --> 00:49:16,959
cannabis does not cause

1412
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,079
schizophrenia uh they reminded me they

1413
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:20,400
talk a lot about that research in the

1414
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:23,280
beginning I Lov that lead in uh cannabis

1415
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:28,280
was Outlaw in 1937 and they actually

1416
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:31,000
mentioned that alcohol poisoning causes

1417
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:33,559
250,000 deaths per year did you catch

1418
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:37,000
the tobacco numbers no 500,000 they

1419
00:49:33,559 --> 00:49:39,839
compare it to the Holocaust yeah they

1420
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:41,440
okay you're right a holocaust around the

1421
00:49:39,838 --> 00:49:43,400
planet every year due to Tobacco

1422
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:45,920
consumption of not just the G or the

1423
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:48,039
Jewish people but also of the German

1424
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:49,079
soldiers that died as well I don't

1425
00:49:48,039 --> 00:49:50,480
remember how they broke it down but it's

1426
00:49:49,079 --> 00:49:52,200
like 5 and a half million people around

1427
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:55,079
the globe die every year due to Tobacco

1428
00:49:52,199 --> 00:49:57,239
consumption and it's just crazy Zero

1429
00:49:55,079 --> 00:49:59,599
from Cannabis yep

1430
00:49:57,239 --> 00:50:01,759
the US is held up as a model around the

1431
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:04,480
around the world is the place that has

1432
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:07,559
pushed tobacco consumption down to

1433
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:09,559
record levels with education that's

1434
00:50:07,559 --> 00:50:12,160
really all we did is we check ID at the

1435
00:50:09,559 --> 00:50:15,760
point of sale and we tell every school

1436
00:50:12,159 --> 00:50:17,318
kid if you smoke tobacco it will lead to

1437
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:19,559
these health effects and we give them

1438
00:50:17,318 --> 00:50:22,719
the legitimate legitimate information on

1439
00:50:19,559 --> 00:50:26,040
Tobacco and that's all we did yep and

1440
00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:28,159
they made a few catchy kind of teenager

1441
00:50:26,039 --> 00:50:29,960

crazy teen smoking ads and stuff but

1444
00:50:32,199 --> 00:50:36,000
like the really effective stuff is just

1445
00:50:34,358 --> 00:50:37,798
sitting the kid down in health class and

1446
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:40,000

1502
00:52:09,199 --> 00:52:13,919
in trouble CU it's the quotes that are

1503
00:52:11,239 --> 00:52:15,838
beautiful when the vaporizer gets set

1504
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:17,519
down on the table so let me let me jump

1505
00:52:15,838 --> 00:52:20,119
in here this dude is about to light the

1506
00:52:17,519 --> 00:52:21,679
bong for this nice looking old lady she

1507
00:52:20,119 --> 00:52:24,079
pulled it closer to her face he's

1508
00:52:21,679 --> 00:52:25,480
showing her what's about to happen she's

1509
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:26,760
shaking the lighter cuz it won't work

1510
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:28,079
she keeps shaking it when she tries

1511
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:30,599
light so now she's toking bro she's

1512
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:32,160
pulling a to she did not carve it no

1513
00:52:30,599 --> 00:52:33,838
none of them carve it they weren't

1514
00:52:32,159 --> 00:52:35,920
instructed to as well they were

1515
00:52:33,838 --> 00:52:39,719
instructed to do everything till

1516
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:41,159
then oh this one old lady um I'd say

1517
00:52:39,719 --> 00:52:43,239
she's probably the older of the three

1518
00:52:41,159 --> 00:52:45,118
she just took a pretty nice bong RI they

1519
00:52:43,239 --> 00:52:46,798
start ripping and here in a second

1520
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:49,640
definitely smoked like a hooka before

1521
00:52:46,798 --> 00:52:50,920
and then oh she goes back for seconds MH

1522
00:52:49,639 --> 00:52:52,798
now the Betty White looking chick is

1523
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:54,760
about to line up for a dab or for a bong

1524
00:52:52,798 --> 00:52:57,920
rip like I really hope they had some

1525
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:59,040
nice Munchies after this video I

1526
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:00,639
that's a lot of smoke coming out of

1527
00:52:59,039 --> 00:53:02,318
there it's what it said in the beginning

1528
00:53:00,639 --> 00:53:04,719
was they gave him snacks and they gave

1529
00:53:02,318 --> 00:53:07,639
him drinks and they gave him pot and or

1530
00:53:04,719 --> 00:53:08,959
cannabis and went with it you know so

1531
00:53:07,639 --> 00:53:10,598
it's all good I don't want to get myself

1532
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:12,240
taken off of [ __ ] iTunes but I'm

1533
00:53:10,599 --> 00:53:13,680
going to put some of the volume in for

1534
00:53:12,239 --> 00:53:15,199
one minute later so here we want to

1535
00:53:13,679 --> 00:53:18,159
listen to this I think it was easier

1536
00:53:15,199 --> 00:53:22,598
than I thought yeah yeah and I think it

1537
00:53:18,159 --> 00:53:25,920
was better to do the the bong and

1538
00:53:22,599 --> 00:53:27,000
not cigarette The Joint all right that's

1539
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:28,599
I don't want to get myself in trouble

1540
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,519
but all right 5 minutes later so I'm

1541
00:53:28,599 --> 00:53:32,920
just going to let it play and then it's

1542
00:53:30,519 --> 00:53:34,280
it's a long video so we'll put some to

1543
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:35,480
feel it now I can go ahead and tell you

1544
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:38,960
basically from memory they're starting

1545
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:41,798
to feel it now Grandma's getting super

1546
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:43,079
high time hilar playing Jing and then

1547
00:53:41,798 --> 00:53:44,519
she starts playing with it with her

1548
00:53:43,079 --> 00:53:46,798
second hand and the other chick's like

1549
00:53:44,519 --> 00:53:48,280
no you can't you're not supposed to play

1550
00:53:46,798 --> 00:53:50,280
and there it goes she couldn't even do

1551
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:51,798
it with two hands so 15 minutes later

1552
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:53,920
we'll turn it up for a second oh they

1553
00:53:51,798 --> 00:53:56,199
pull out a

1554
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:57,680
vaporizer well I won't tell you what was

1555
00:53:56,199 --> 00:54:00,480
going through my mind leave it up it

1556
00:53:57,679 --> 00:54:00,480
kind of looks like a sex

1557
00:54:01,679 --> 00:54:06,480
toy was I thought it was a dildo but

1558
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:07,838
I've never seen anything on the end of

1559
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:10,318
it like

1560
00:54:07,838 --> 00:54:13,279
this all right the vaporizer that's been

1561
00:54:10,318 --> 00:54:15,279
produced looks like a dildo straw coming

1562
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:17,000
out of the tip and now she's token it

1563
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:18,359
she's actually hitting it so I'm going

1564
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,239
to jump in a couple of minutes because I

1565
00:54:18,358 --> 00:54:21,920
don't want to watch these old ladies

1566

consumption and they're at the end uh

1609

1611
00:55:55,719 --> 00:55:58,358
