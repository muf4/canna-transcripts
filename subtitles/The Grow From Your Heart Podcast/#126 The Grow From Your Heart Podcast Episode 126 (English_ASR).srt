29
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:12,729
working good I think I've done more

30
00:01:10,989 --> 00:01:14,469
damage to my head working on this

31
00:01:12,728 --> 00:01:16,390
podcast that I did it like all of the

32
00:01:14,469 --> 00:01:18,868
concerts I saw in my early 20s working

33
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:21,099
well I just said it's working good

34
00:01:18,868 --> 00:01:23,290
what's working our English skills today

35
00:01:21,099 --> 00:01:25,149
class yeah well I apologize for the

36
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:26,259
other headphone malfunctions there now

37
00:01:25,149 --> 00:01:27,549
we're good I don't know what was going

38
00:01:26,259 --> 00:01:29,049
on with this equipment today it was

39
00:01:27,549 --> 00:01:31,390
super loud and it was super quiet and it

40
00:01:29,049 --> 00:01:33,100
was extra loud and you guys don't care

41
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:36,579
you guys just want a quality show so

42
00:01:33,099 --> 00:01:38,679
let's get into that part um we're gonna

43
00:01:36,578 --> 00:01:41,559
read some news articles we may actually

44
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:44,289
play a news article but first let's talk

45
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:46,600
about another email that I did not

46
00:01:44,289 --> 00:01:47,739
include in the last episode I think it

47
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:49,149
might have been a Facebook message is

48
00:01:47,739 --> 00:01:50,170
why I missed it shout-out to her friend

49
00:01:49,149 --> 00:01:52,210
Rasta Seb

50
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:53,590
Rasta said has had a little bit of bad

51
00:01:52,209 --> 00:01:55,149
luck but things will turn around for

52
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:57,399
your brother I feel bad for what

53
00:01:55,149 --> 00:02:00,789
happened to you but Rasta said sent me a

54
00:01:57,399 --> 00:02:02,259
question asking what is reclaim and we

55
00:02:00,789 --> 00:02:04,509
can't laugh at the guy we got it we got

56
00:02:02,259 --> 00:02:06,579
to remember not everybody is smoking 4 &amp;

57
00:02:04,509 --> 00:02:08,679
5 grams of hash on their day off not

58
00:02:06,578 --> 00:02:10,509
everybody lives across to a completely

59
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:11,770
good question no giggles at all most

60
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:13,479
people well yeah a lot of people in

61
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:14,710
Colorado be like let's reclaim reclaim

62
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:16,299
is this bro so

63
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:19,710
for all you folks out there who are not

64
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:24,460
able to consume a whole bunch of Earl

65
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:26,500
spoil hash breath I talk to people all

66
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:28,180
day who I like I don't even bother to

67
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:30,069
get to reclaim with them because like I

68
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:32,590
already gave them with thesaurus worth

69
00:02:30,069 --> 00:02:34,209
the [ __ ] the look on Mike's face was

70
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:37,539
priceless here okay so let me tell you

71
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:40,030
what reclaim is when we use a dab rig we

72
00:02:37,539 --> 00:02:41,679
put a nail attached to the rig somehow

73
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:43,270
it either sits on the outside of a mail

74
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,680
joint or it sits on the inside of the

75
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:46,480
mail joint and then you put a dome on it

76
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,010
either way you heat up that nail and

77
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:50,530
then you put some hash onto there and

78
00:02:48,009 --> 00:02:54,129
you inhale and as you inhale some of

79
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:55,870
that hash oil will collect onto your rig

80
00:02:54,129 --> 00:02:58,479
just like the resin collects on your

81
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:59,110
pipe they doing good so far Mike yeah

82
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:01,269
okay

83
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:03,310
just as we vaporize the hash before it

84
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:05,469
all gets to us some of it on vaporizes

85
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:07,870
and reconstitutes itself and to reclaim

86
00:03:05,469 --> 00:03:11,169
yeah and then a lot of times that'll

87
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:14,349
fill up in if you're smoking BHO I

88
00:03:11,169 --> 00:03:16,299
highly recommend you using a rig we call

89
00:03:14,349 --> 00:03:17,590
the rig a pipe it's a bong you guys it's

90
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:19,630
a small bong I like a little small

91
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:21,310
bubbler especial little hash bong we

92
00:03:19,629 --> 00:03:23,409
call it we call it a rig but I like

93
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:25,060
something small I'd highly recommend you

94
00:03:23,409 --> 00:03:27,039
smoke with something with water in it

95
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:28,689
you want that bubble actually down the

96
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:29,889
hash is really hot just cool it a little

97
00:03:28,689 --> 00:03:33,280
bit before it gets to your lungs and

98
00:03:29,889 --> 00:03:35,159
throw it'll really help you out so a lot

99
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,120
of times a water will collect a lot of

100
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:38,680
reclaim in there so there's a lot of

101
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,500
claim in the water there's a lot of

102
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:42,760
claim on the entryway to the pipe a lot

103
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,680
of times I'll use what's called a drop

104
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:47,439
down grabbing my drop down right now to

105
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:49,030
get it nice visual the drop down goes on

106
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:51,400
to the rig where the nail would normally

107
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:53,050
go and it's an extension of glass it'll

108
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,459
actually go a little lower to get the

109
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:55,750
nail out of your face a little bit and

110
00:03:54,459 --> 00:03:58,090
get it further away from your head and

111
00:03:55,750 --> 00:04:00,879
then the nail goes on there and then a

112
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:02,140
lot of the oil the reclaim oil will

113
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,969
collect right into here and there's some

114
00:04:02,139 --> 00:04:06,159
here that we can talk about there's I

115
00:04:03,969 --> 00:04:08,859
don't know that's probably a measurement

116
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:10,389
of one DRAM 1/2 DRAM I think is what

117
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:11,860
that it would be probably if you poured

118
00:04:10,389 --> 00:04:13,958
it out it would be half a gram one of

119
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:15,640
those little tiny vials yeah they'd be

120
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:17,230
half of one of those is what I think so

121
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:19,599
I've got a half of a half a dram of

122
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:21,459
reclaimed that I could remove from here

123
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,980
and do something with so that's what

124
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:24,970
reclaim is it's that's basically

125
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:27,879
reconstituted hash oil that stuck to my

126
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:30,669
piece what can you do with it was one of

127
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:33,439
his follow-up questions I've seen people

128
00:04:30,668 --> 00:04:35,269
just stick the dabber inside of

129
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:37,009
this mucky part and pull it out and read

130
00:04:35,269 --> 00:04:38,839
a bit some people will do that our

131
00:04:37,009 --> 00:04:40,579
friend forty-four he would do that

132
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:43,939
that's not against his standards

133
00:04:40,579 --> 00:04:46,250
lots of people go for dabbing and uh I

134
00:04:43,939 --> 00:04:49,550
know a lot of people who take great care

135
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:51,500
to clean it out and then try to like dry

136
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:53,870
it out drying it out is the part that I

137
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:55,879
would make really well leave it on on

138
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:57,500
some parchment paper or on an oil slick

139
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:59,389
pad make sure you let it dry really well

140
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:01,100
before you try to dab it again I talked

141
00:04:59,389 --> 00:05:04,819
to one dude who's cleaning his rig with

142
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:06,320
Everclear so that he could throw that

143
00:05:04,819 --> 00:05:08,329
into a glass dish when he was done

144
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:10,399
agitating getting his rig all clean and

145
00:05:08,329 --> 00:05:13,129
then slowly evaporate that back down and

146
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:15,529
death like reclaimed powder I think our

147
00:05:13,129 --> 00:05:16,909
friend Gary was uh teaching me about

148
00:05:15,529 --> 00:05:18,019
that a while back so shout-out Gary I'm

149
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:19,280
not sure if you still listen to the show

150
00:05:18,019 --> 00:05:22,609
but he was talking about doing something

151
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:24,979
very similar our friend Fox with CBD CBD

152
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:27,139
extract on CB B I think what he would

153
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:30,170
say would be to make edibles at it

154
00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:32,569
that's of another use that no number of

155
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:35,500
people do it's already been D car is it

156
00:05:32,569 --> 00:05:38,480
decarboxylase or decarboxylated eyes

157
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:40,040
eyes okay look like you just picked one

158
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,600
I was gonna say you just pick I said

159
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,490
them both in my head and I was like now

160
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,740
the first one it sounds like it's bendy

161
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:47,600
carved because it's been heated to a

162
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:49,009
temperature above a certain Beyond for

163
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,480
it's been heat I don't even know how hot

164
00:05:49,009 --> 00:05:54,439
the surface of this nail is it is really

165
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:56,150
hot and it's reconstituted so it's been

166
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:57,620
activated essentially so many eat it

167
00:05:56,149 --> 00:05:59,060
it's already broken down so that your

168
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:01,910
body doesn't have to break it down as

169
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:04,459
much to make the psychoactive components

170
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:06,350
bioavailable well that was deep on

171
00:06:04,459 --> 00:06:09,560
accident but okay so that's what reclaim

172
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:11,600
is I may be an [ __ ] because what I do

173
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:13,250
with it is I fill my rig with rubbing

174
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,250
alcohol and I shake it up real good and

175
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:17,209
I pour that [ __ ] down the drain and

176
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:20,810
ironically for some reason my garbage

177
00:06:17,209 --> 00:06:22,789
disposal doesn't work that's too high

178
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:24,319
I'm a vegetarian I don't eat anything

179
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:25,669
that would really clog that thing up I

180
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,069
don't put anything down there I just

181
00:06:25,668 --> 00:06:33,289
need some like 90% sure I need to pour a

182
00:06:28,069 --> 00:06:35,839
bottle I sew down my resin I got a whole

183
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:38,120
bunch of reclaim in there I nine times

184
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:40,819
out of 10 I do the same thing if I've

185
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:43,160
got a big fat glob of reclaim sitting

186
00:06:40,819 --> 00:06:44,519
somewhere that's easy to get to I'll use

187
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,139
my torch to

188
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:48,568
extract it real quick just kind of heat

189
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:50,430
it up just a little quit it turn it into

190
00:06:48,569 --> 00:06:53,460
basically liquid yeah and then pour it

191
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:56,250
and do a silicone container and I use it

192
00:06:53,459 --> 00:06:58,589
for seasoning my nail that's a great use

193
00:06:56,250 --> 00:07:01,408
for it honestly it's the only reason I

194
00:06:58,589 --> 00:07:03,209
keep it around and so I only do it what

195
00:07:01,408 --> 00:07:04,889
I've got like a really fat glob sitting

196
00:07:03,209 --> 00:07:06,779
there cuz what I've got now I could

197
00:07:04,889 --> 00:07:08,400
seize about 100 nails with so we're

198
00:07:06,779 --> 00:07:10,649
gonna get another question what the hell

199
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:12,658
does he mean season your nail when you

200
00:07:10,649 --> 00:07:14,339
get a new titanium nail just like any

201
00:07:12,658 --> 00:07:15,629
skillet that you would want to cook on

202
00:07:14,339 --> 00:07:17,339
any pan that you're gonna cook on you're

203
00:07:15,629 --> 00:07:19,740
gonna want to put some oil or fatty

204
00:07:17,339 --> 00:07:21,060
substance on it to grease it up before

205
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:24,210
you cook on it so that you don't taste

206
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:25,649
that that iron that cast-iron you wanna

207
00:07:24,209 --> 00:07:27,239
just cast iron on whatever you're

208
00:07:25,649 --> 00:07:28,709
cooking if it's you're making some

209
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,658
asparagus in there if you're making pork

210
00:07:28,709 --> 00:07:32,129
chops you don't taste [ __ ] cast-iron

211
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:34,319
and you don't want to just taste raw

212
00:07:32,129 --> 00:07:36,149
titanium so when I get a new nail I'll

213
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,610
heat it up just to about dab temperature

214
00:07:36,149 --> 00:07:39,989
and I'll let it cool so that the nail so

215
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:41,840
that the oil will puddle on there and

216
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:45,240
kind of soak into the pores of the nail

217
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:46,649
so you want to kind of season your nail

218
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,908
before you start dabbing with the brand

219
00:07:46,649 --> 00:07:49,859
new titanium meal and you can do with

220
00:07:47,908 --> 00:07:51,718
quartz also once you get a quartz nail

221
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:53,879
perfectly seasoned it's so smooth and

222
00:07:51,718 --> 00:07:55,769
tastes really really nice I finally got

223
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:57,899
to hit a really nice quartz banger

224
00:07:55,769 --> 00:08:00,689
recently and it tasted really good

225
00:07:57,899 --> 00:08:04,348
shout out to boba blaster Co and the

226
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:07,259

hey listen or sent a Facebook message

237
00:08:23,908 --> 00:08:26,610
you know I wasn't even prepared for this

238
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,918
let me grab my phone and we'll read a

239
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:30,598
Facebook message right quick yeah that

240
00:08:28,918 --> 00:08:32,728
was a fun show to record I got some good

241
00:08:30,598 --> 00:08:34,379
feedback on it from some people this

242
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:35,820
Facebook message stemmed from that

243
00:08:34,379 --> 00:08:37,458
episode I'm pulling it up on my phone

244
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:40,169
right now this is impromptu it was not

245
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:42,649
wait till you guys are both here but uh

246
00:08:40,168 --> 00:08:46,740
it seems like fair time to mention this

247
00:08:42,649 --> 00:08:48,899
here we go this comment she said oh and

248
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:50,370
she has replied to my reply she said I

249
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:51,929
listened to this podcast and was sad to

250
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:54,028
hear that the libertarian candidates

251
00:08:51,929 --> 00:08:55,679
were ignored or were entirely ignored

252
00:08:54,028 --> 00:08:57,778
Gary Johnson is way better than Sanders

253
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:58,409
on cannabis Johnson besides owning an

254
00:08:57,778 --> 00:09:00,179
x-ray

255
00:08:58,409 --> 00:09:02,338
even admits to using cannabis so when

256
00:09:00,179 --> 00:09:04,679
Hilary Burt's burnt beats Bernie which

257
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:06,509
she will and that she leaves us a link

258
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:11,609
to follow so that we can read about a

259
00:09:06,509 --> 00:09:15,240
libertarian future no I'm very familiar

260
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:17,100
with Gary Johnson I'm a big fan I'm just

261
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:20,610
a realist

262
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:22,680
Gary's awesome but Gary don't have a

263
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:24,720
shot she said thanks I'm actually

264
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:26,458
rooting for Bernie for the DEM

265
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,339
nomination but my heart is with Gary

266
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:32,578
Johnson and she said it's not totally

267
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:33,509
impossible for Gary Johnson so I don't

268
00:09:32,578 --> 00:09:34,888
know enough about that to have an

269
00:09:33,509 --> 00:09:37,860
opinion it sounds like Mike does what I

270
00:09:34,889 --> 00:09:39,329
do have an opinion on is that Elizabeth

271
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:41,459
I appreciate your interaction with the

272
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:42,539
podcast on Facebook keep it up if you

273
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:43,799
ever have any more questions or anything

274
00:09:42,539 --> 00:09:46,169

you

277
00:09:46,789 --> 00:09:52,409
the the Libertarian candidate is

278
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:54,810
typically far better on marijuana policy

279
00:09:52,409 --> 00:09:58,110
than the Democrat or the Republican

280
00:09:54,809 --> 00:09:59,578
candidates but they don't have a shot

281
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:01,409
right now like we just don't have that

282
00:09:59,578 --> 00:10:05,429
third-party infrastructure in the United

283
00:10:01,409 --> 00:10:07,620
States sorry I liked it I didn't do it

00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:35,690
from another shop so I don't know how

327
00:11:33,169 --> 00:11:36,860
many of the places participated but I'll

328
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:38,870
play the news article for you but what

329
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:40,759
they did was they were giving away a

330
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:42,500
free joint if you participated in their

331
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:44,149
litter cleanup program if you went and

332
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,889
picked up one bag of trash and brought

333
00:11:44,149 --> 00:11:47,600
it back to the organizer of this event

334
00:11:45,889 --> 00:11:49,120
he would give you a free joint and

335
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,110
there's an image of him standing here

336
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,750
unfortunately he's standing in the park

337
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:55,070
with a bowl of doob tubes full of joints

338
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:56,509
he's got the joints aren't exposed

339
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:58,730
they're in little containers right like

340
00:11:56,509 --> 00:12:00,470
if I would have organized this event it

341
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:03,560
would be an organized slightly different

342
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:05,269
but I love it for what it is and what it

343
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:08,389
did for the community it's a very good

344
00:12:05,269 --> 00:12:10,159
item it's not a hundred percent like put

345
00:12:08,389 --> 00:12:14,659
your best foot forward necessarily as

346
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:17,929
far as optics go but I love it do joints

347
00:12:14,659 --> 00:12:19,610
for picking up trash all the way clean

348
00:12:17,929 --> 00:12:20,959
everything up oh and if you could smoke

349
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:24,169
the joint while you pick up trash was

350
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:27,110
that make it a lot better sure you can't

351
00:12:24,169 --> 00:12:28,219
do that that's the whole thing was

352
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:29,960
handed about cuz I'm sure plenty of

353
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:31,700
people did that like it was just bring

354
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,900
me a bag of trash get a joint I'm sure

355
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:34,790
there were plenty of people who brought

356
00:12:32,899 --> 00:12:35,779
him several bags of trash I don't know

357
00:12:34,789 --> 00:12:42,589
how many people wouldn't cleaned out

358
00:12:35,779 --> 00:12:44,299
their car but I'd like to see see more

359
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:46,970
the industry doing stuff like that like

360
00:12:44,299 --> 00:12:49,159
the consumption clubs can really push

361
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:51,050
the boundaries with like giving away

362
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:52,549
product and stuff like that like the the

363
00:12:51,049 --> 00:12:54,199
shops can't even give away product

364
00:12:52,549 --> 00:12:55,879
legally they have to charge at least a

365
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,589
penny right the only way a dispensary

366
00:12:55,879 --> 00:12:59,480
would be able to do that would to be if

367
00:12:57,589 --> 00:13:01,070
they checked your ID before they let you

368
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:03,500
sign up for the program and then they

369
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:05,030
would have to give you a coupon it may

370
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,379
give you a joint for a penny because

371
00:13:05,029 --> 00:13:08,569
they can't give you anything for free

372
00:13:06,379 --> 00:13:10,669
right and so that then you'd have to go

373
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:12,530
back to that shop and get the joint for

374
00:13:10,669 --> 00:13:14,120
a penny with your coupon but then didn't

375
00:13:12,529 --> 00:13:15,919
you just technically you were employed

376
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:18,320
by that dispensary if that happens

377
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:20,870
you're like kinda not really because

378
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:23,000
they're just handing out it's you who

379
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:23,990
they hand coupons to this doesn't know I

380
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,399
don't know if you claim that's

381
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:27,769
employment but like

382
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:30,019
I'm sure that I stink would get raised

383
00:13:27,769 --> 00:13:31,850
if a dispensary actually did that oh

384
00:13:30,019 --> 00:13:33,199
yeah too many times to jump through for

385
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:36,500
the dispensary nobody would take tax

386
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:38,000
money on it right all sorts of things

387
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:40,399
well the shop would have to pay the

388
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,070
taxes on that as though it's sold at

389
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:45,139
normal price I bet it would be the bike

390
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:46,820
that the shop would have to take but

391
00:13:45,139 --> 00:13:49,069
like there's a shop down here that's

392
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:50,690
adopted to strip a highway and I Drive

393
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:52,490
that strip a highway every day and it's

394
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:54,230
always [ __ ] filthy and I shake my

395
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:55,789
head every time I Drive and see that

396
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:57,500
sign so they need to get out there and

397
00:13:55,789 --> 00:13:59,209
clean it up they're part of the highway

398
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,620
their little redheaded stepchild part of

399
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:03,860
Highway part of the highways all dirty

400
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:05,960
you know get out there and fulfill your

401
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:08,360
obligation and shout out to the shot at

402
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:10,670
the consumption clubs that did this

403
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:12,409
event I wish more the industry was

404
00:14:10,669 --> 00:14:14,389
thinking of stuff like this now but

405
00:14:12,409 --> 00:14:16,279

here off the Cimarron and the park off

425
00:14:55,460 --> 00:15:00,680
of 26 the effort started here at vermejo

426
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:04,160
Park where volunteers were picking up

427
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:05,929
trash for a unique reward as you bring

428
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:07,850
bags of trash back to me

429
00:15:05,929 --> 00:15:11,209
I'm gonna give you a joint per bag you

430
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:14,180
bring back for those clean it wasn't

431
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:15,889
just about the free weed I hike every

432
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:18,109
single day and I see trash on every

433
00:15:15,889 --> 00:15:20,870
single trail and it saddens me it was a

434
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:23,810
personal connection to their home so it

435
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:25,370
feels good to actually don't pick the

436
00:15:23,809 --> 00:15:28,549
trash up you know I don't mind it

437
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:31,129
because I use I use the trail cleaning

438
00:15:28,549 --> 00:15:33,799
up the park as well as the reputation of

439
00:15:31,129 --> 00:15:35,809
the marijuana industry to show that we

440
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:47,240
are a positive impact you know there's

441
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:48,679
nothing wrong with every month and move

442
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:51,529
to other parts of the city

443
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:54,229
yep so every month that'd be cool to see

444
00:15:51,529 --> 00:15:56,029
people picking up trash for pot yep yeah

445
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:57,649
so that shows you guys we're not just a

446
00:15:56,029 --> 00:15:59,209
bunch of lazy stoners we do contribute

447
00:15:57,649 --> 00:16:00,500
to the community we want it to be

448
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:02,120
cleaner we're at the park chillin out

449
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,110
enjoying our buzz we want it to be clean

450
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:05,060
we don't want to look around and see

451
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:08,570
trash everywhere right so because this

452
00:16:05,059 --> 00:16:10,759
weird myth out there that because we're

453
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:13,870
associated with marijuana like we want

454
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:17,059
everything to be bad and destroyed and

455
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:19,070
stoned or I don't know that we're like

456
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:20,719
bad people and it's just nonsense like

457
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:22,850
we're people just like everybody else is

458
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,940
just we like cannabis - one thing I've

459
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:28,250
noticed being around pot heads a lot for

460
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:29,920
the past 20 years is a lot of them have

461
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:32,179
OCD

462
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:33,799
especially and I may sound sexist but

463
00:16:32,179 --> 00:16:36,979
this is just what I've observed a lot of

464
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:38,359
women get got to clean some [ __ ] OCD

465
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:40,009
they get stoned and they're like all

466
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:41,330
those dishes are dirty [ __ ] all that and

467
00:16:40,009 --> 00:16:43,069
they just go clean the dishes and it's

468
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:44,509
not it's just goes in their mind they

469
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:46,370
like those dishes can't be dirty it's

470
00:16:44,509 --> 00:16:48,919
driving me crazy so they do the damn

471
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:50,720
dishes and pot heads get the same OCD

472
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:52,219
like there's trash everywhere I gotta

473
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,190
pick it up make my environment look good

474
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:55,939
it's just miserable I was a Boy Scout

475
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:57,649
back

476
00:16:55,938 --> 00:16:59,298
the day like it was important that the

477
00:16:57,649 --> 00:17:03,408
people around me that like when we went

478
00:16:59,298 --> 00:17:06,349
camping not only did we do zero-impact

479
00:17:03,408 --> 00:17:08,538
camping so I Leave No Trace camping but

480
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:10,609
like we actively pay attention and grab

481
00:17:08,538 --> 00:17:12,318
other trash while we're out there like

482
00:17:10,609 --> 00:17:14,568
we always had one pocket full of other

483
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:16,578
people's [ __ ] like on the way back

484
00:17:14,568 --> 00:17:18,349
to camp at night just so that next time

485
00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:21,888
we were up there it was a little better

486
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:24,138
than it was this time and like I do it

out in the public

509
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:07,339
like what's the Starbucks cup doing in

510
00:18:05,388 --> 00:18:09,439
my parking lot like it wasn't there 20

511
00:18:07,339 --> 00:18:11,449
minutes ago I go on hikes and I find the

512
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:14,149
weirdest [ __ ] on hikes and I'll be far

513
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:15,950
from like the car or whatever where I

514
00:18:14,148 --> 00:18:17,359
can't wherever there is I'm far from it

515
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:19,700
I'm like how did people bring a [ __ ]

516
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:21,168
pie and some Forks out here like what

517
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,580
were these people doing and why couldn't

518
00:18:21,169 --> 00:18:24,679
they just take their pie container back

519
00:18:22,579 --> 00:18:26,509
right pie container and a bunch of

520
00:18:24,679 --> 00:18:27,740
plastic forks and I found a stop sign

521
00:18:26,509 --> 00:18:30,110
out in the middle of nowhere one time

522
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:31,878
just clean your [ __ ] up people are weird

523
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:37,189
all right we are way off on a tangent

524
00:18:31,878 --> 00:18:39,079
here but no the news article picking up

525
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:41,808
trash for joints it's a great idea I

526
00:18:39,079 --> 00:18:44,839
just yeah take it all the way through

527
00:18:41,808 --> 00:18:46,308
please yeah let's not give out the

528
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:47,720
joints in the park next time that looked

529
00:18:46,308 --> 00:18:50,028
a little weird on the news there right

530
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:52,069
that's the one thing that everybody sort

531
00:18:50,028 --> 00:18:54,919
of has against the consumption clubs is

532
00:18:52,069 --> 00:18:59,509
that some of them have found a way to do

533
00:18:54,919 --> 00:19:01,399
some sort of distribution and we're

534
00:18:59,509 --> 00:19:03,769
giving joints away in the park for

535
00:19:01,398 --> 00:19:05,388
bringing us bags of trash like that's an

536
00:19:03,769 --> 00:19:06,859
awesome program dude getting people to

537
00:19:05,388 --> 00:19:09,769
clean up trash I don't care how you do

538
00:19:06,859 --> 00:19:11,359
it I'm gonna jump in and interrupt you

539
00:19:09,769 --> 00:19:14,179
and do my part for the consumption clubs

540
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:16,609
I'm going to avoid the word distribution

541
00:19:14,179 --> 00:19:19,460
sorry we would much rather hear the word

542
00:19:16,609 --> 00:19:20,719
reimbursement well I'm just educating

543
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:22,308
you and our listeners so that when you

544
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,579
if you guys come to a consumption Club

545
00:19:22,308 --> 00:19:27,648
don't say purchase don't say buy say may

546
00:19:25,579 --> 00:19:29,240
i reimburse you for some of that fine

547
00:19:27,648 --> 00:19:30,888
quality product they're like

548
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:33,349
reimbursement is the key word in these

549
00:19:30,888 --> 00:19:35,148
places and this is why it's important

550
00:19:33,349 --> 00:19:38,558
how you [ __ ] vote I'm sick of word

551
00:19:35,148 --> 00:19:38,558
games you just call them all [ __ ]

552
00:19:40,808 --> 00:19:44,778
yeah we're just talking about how some

553
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:48,200
head shops in Colorado we're still

554
00:19:44,778 --> 00:19:51,470
playing the water pipe game because they

555
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:53,210
have to and it's just nonsense it's

556
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:55,220
because enough of our generation isn't

557
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:56,569
voting regular yeah the water pipe game

558
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:58,308
I want to define the water pipe game

559
00:19:56,569 --> 00:20:00,168
because some people might not only come

560
00:19:58,308 --> 00:20:02,178
into my marijuana store I'm happy to

561
00:20:00,169 --> 00:20:04,788
show you the bongs on my shelf and tell

562
00:20:02,179 --> 00:20:07,548
you how much my bongs cost but if the

563
00:20:04,788 --> 00:20:09,259
head shop up the road shows you the

564
00:20:07,548 --> 00:20:10,849
exact same thing they're not allowed to

565
00:20:09,259 --> 00:20:12,740
call it a bong because if it's a bong it

566
00:20:10,849 --> 00:20:14,628
might be used for marijuana and if it's

567
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:17,929
used for marijuana it's not really legal

568
00:20:14,628 --> 00:20:21,859
legal to sell it's still against federal

569
00:20:17,929 --> 00:20:23,960
law because you called it a bong yeah

570
00:20:21,859 --> 00:20:29,000
it's 2016 we should be able to say can I

571
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:31,850
check out that bomb it really you should

572
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,470
be saying I'm in that rig right I'm sick

573
00:20:31,849 --> 00:20:35,808
of the word games it's legal in Colorado

574
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:39,679
now and there are still places where you

575
00:20:35,808 --> 00:20:42,368
have to say water pipe and I'm a huge

576
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:45,379
advocate for consumption clubs and

577
00:20:42,368 --> 00:20:49,339
learning another word game makes that

578
00:20:45,378 --> 00:20:50,658
harder well that segues into my next

579
00:20:49,339 --> 00:20:51,980
news article because you said

580
00:20:50,659 --> 00:20:54,860
consumption clubs in you're a big fan

581
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:56,269
but um this article says this is from

582
00:20:54,859 --> 00:20:58,398
the indie the Colorado Springs

583
00:20:56,269 --> 00:21:00,319
independent it was by NAT Stein the

584
00:20:58,398 --> 00:21:02,089
article headline says City Council bans

585
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:04,579
cannabis clubs knowing full-well

586
00:21:02,089 --> 00:21:06,019
lawsuit is coming and this is was

587
00:21:04,579 --> 00:21:08,178
shocking news because just a few days

588
00:21:06,019 --> 00:21:09,740
ago we were told they had eight years to

589
00:21:08,179 --> 00:21:11,389
get their [ __ ] together to recoup their

590
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:13,069
investments it was a really weird

591
00:21:11,388 --> 00:21:15,079
decision they're too dangerous to be

592
00:21:13,069 --> 00:21:17,658
open but they have eight years to recoup

593
00:21:15,079 --> 00:21:20,658
their expenses like well which is it so

594
00:21:17,659 --> 00:21:22,310
the article goes a little bit like this

595
00:21:20,659 --> 00:21:26,860
nice trying to hide that I

596
00:21:22,309 --> 00:21:31,789
that real well do cancer [ __ ] fierce

597
00:21:26,859 --> 00:21:33,319
[ __ ] and cheers [ __ ] did I drink

598
00:21:31,789 --> 00:21:34,849
this whole aah it's like 1:00 in the

599
00:21:33,319 --> 00:21:36,589
morning I'm just glad to be getting the

600
00:21:34,849 --> 00:21:39,679
show disordered at all ginger raid

601
00:21:36,589 --> 00:21:43,000
kombucha and I don't know there my time

602
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:45,560
I don't know I feel strange from it

603
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,509
every time you drink I see random things

604
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:49,579
floating in the bottom of it that's

605
00:21:47,509 --> 00:21:51,019
kombucha you know I think I have a nice

606
00:21:49,579 --> 00:21:52,309
little kombucha buzz going on to tell

607
00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:54,769
you the truth anyway this article goes

608
00:21:52,309 --> 00:21:56,240
like this America a marathon session at

609
00:21:54,769 --> 00:21:58,220
City Hall on Tuesday featured City

610
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,109
Council dissenters of all stripes those

611
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:02,480
who push back on councilor Andy Pecos

612
00:22:00,109 --> 00:22:03,979
proposed resolution opposing refugee

613
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,269
settlement those who delivered a

614
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:07,160
petition demanding repeal of the

615
00:22:05,269 --> 00:22:09,920
recently enacted pedestrian access Act

616
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:11,450
those who bombed that promotes land swap

617
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:13,310
deal with the Broadmoor and finally

618
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:15,110
those pleading once again for Council to

619
00:22:13,309 --> 00:22:17,000
keep the cannabis clubs on shuddered

620
00:22:15,109 --> 00:22:19,189
none of that resolved except for the

621
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,519
club issue but not in a way most had

622
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:24,529
urged the clubs which were membership

623
00:22:22,519 --> 00:22:26,629
based social clubs that allow for adult

624
00:22:24,529 --> 00:22:28,730
marijuana use have caused consternation

625
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:30,740
for city officials for several years now

626
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:34,519
they first started springing up after

627
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:37,339
voter approved amendment 64 in 2013 2014

628
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:39,019
excuse me studio a 64 one a zoning

629
00:22:37,339 --> 00:22:40,879
violation appeal in which the city

630
00:22:39,019 --> 00:22:43,099
granted the downtown club a similar use

631
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,230
determination in essence saying that

632
00:22:43,099 --> 00:22:47,839
cannabis clubs are like social clubs so

633
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:49,039
are areas zoned as such and then in

634
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:50,809
parentheses it says permitted in

635
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:53,450
multi-family residential commercial and

636
00:22:50,809 --> 00:22:55,460
industrial zone districts more clubs

637
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:57,170
opened up all over town even after the

638
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:59,509
six-month moratorium on new marijuana

639
00:22:57,170 --> 00:23:01,730
business licensing began in September

640
00:22:59,509 --> 00:23:04,879
the city couldn't stop issuing a license

641
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:06,079
that did not exist then earlier this

642
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,820
month the Planning Commission

643
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:09,769
recommended banning the club's outright

644
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:11,629
counselor Don Knight took the ordens to

645
00:23:09,769 --> 00:23:13,400
Council proposing the group prohibit the

646
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:15,860
opening of any new clubs mandate

647
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:17,930
licensure for all clubs that operated

648
00:23:15,859 --> 00:23:19,519
prior to the moratorium subject to all

649
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:21,140
sorts of new rules and forced those

650
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:23,509
clubs to close doors after eight years

651
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:26,600
this is the ordinance Council gave a

652
00:23:23,509 --> 00:23:29,420
final reading on Tuesday councilor Bill

653
00:23:26,599 --> 00:23:31,669
Murray move the move to the table the

654
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:33,410
ordinance for six months so council

655
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:35,640
could work with the industry to develop

656
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:37,500
more moderate regulations

657
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:39,240
the end council voted six to three in

658
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:42,359
favor of adopting Knights original

659
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:44,250
proposal counselors Jill Gabler and

660
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:46,529
Helen Collins joined Murray in voting no

661
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:48,180
we talked about limited government all

662
00:23:46,529 --> 00:23:50,009
the time but limited government is not

663
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:52,170
about number of employees it's about

664
00:23:50,009 --> 00:23:55,859
limited laws Murray said returning

665
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:57,810
democracy into a morality play Gabler

666
00:23:55,859 --> 00:23:59,549
said she was skeptical of the pup of the

667
00:23:57,809 --> 00:24:02,159
public process behind the measure or

668
00:23:59,549 --> 00:24:03,269
lack thereof Collins on her part said

669
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:05,580
she didn't think a band would be

670
00:24:03,269 --> 00:24:07,829
constitutional Knight and counselor

671
00:24:05,579 --> 00:24:09,839
Keith King both argued that council had

672
00:24:07,829 --> 00:24:11,819
already exercised its right under

673
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:14,819
amendment 64 to opt out of the retail

674
00:24:11,819 --> 00:24:16,859
side of marijuana night cited articles

675
00:24:14,819 --> 00:24:18,480
from The Gazette and Fox News as proof

676
00:24:16,859 --> 00:24:20,129
those articles highlight the club's

677
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,450
practice of offering marijuana to

678
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:23,400
patrons who didn't bring their own

679
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:26,279
sometimes in exchange for a donation or

680
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:27,930
reimbursement assisting other adult and

681
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:30,000
the use of marijuana is permissible

682
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:31,710
under act 64 is what this article says

683
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,809
this article is written in two different

684
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:35,069
colors so I apologize for my stutter it

685
00:24:33,809 --> 00:24:36,299
makes my eyes jump around when it's in

686
00:24:35,069 --> 00:24:38,609
two colors like that don't do that if

687
00:24:36,299 --> 00:24:40,619
you type some [ __ ] that's great coders

688
00:24:38,609 --> 00:24:42,179
and goers took their opportunity during

689
00:24:40,619 --> 00:24:45,239
basic public comment to try and correct

690
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:47,310
some misconceptions amber Reis ik owner

691
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:49,470
of studio a 64 insisted that cannabis

692
00:24:47,309 --> 00:24:52,109
clubs are benign relative to bars that

693
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:53,400
serve alcohol she says I get off at 1

694
00:24:52,109 --> 00:24:55,649
a.m. in the morning and every time I

695
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:57,509
Drive downtown I see people outside the

696
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:59,400
bar stumbling around causing problems

697
00:24:57,509 --> 00:25:01,799
getting into fights we are peaceful

698
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:03,930
peaceful people she said all we want is

699
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:05,579
a place to be accepted as human beings

700
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:08,630
smoking weed is how we choose to relax

701
00:25:05,579 --> 00:25:10,679
and it isn't hurting one it's our right

702
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:12,720
presents mercier I hope I said that

703
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:15,150
right patron and cousin of a local club

704
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:17,039
owner took a different tack even if you

705
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:19,110
hate pot that's fine she said but we all

706
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:20,849
love money right think about what you'd

707
00:25:19,109 --> 00:25:22,609
gain from these clubs and that's such a

708
00:25:20,849 --> 00:25:24,750
good point I mean that's kind of a

709
00:25:22,609 --> 00:25:25,919
tasteless way to say it but I mean it's

710
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:27,569
the truth think about all the money that

711
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:29,190
you're gonna miss out on if they closed

712
00:25:27,569 --> 00:25:31,710
all of these clubs yep

713
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:33,660
- shutting down a bunch of businesses I

714
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:36,150
mean you lose you lose a lot more than

715
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:38,460
the sales tax payroll tax property tax

716
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:39,990
business tax and then all of the money

717
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:41,610
that those employees go spend back in

718
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:43,710
your community I mean I know this is

719
00:25:41,609 --> 00:25:46,199
silly like there are places in the world

720
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:48,120
that already have these clubs owned and

721
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:49,788
regulated little counties happens to be

722
00:25:48,119 --> 00:25:52,979
one of them

723
00:25:49,788 --> 00:25:53,908
there's just Colorado Springs isn't one

724
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:57,179
so they're pretending like it's

725
00:25:53,909 --> 00:25:59,909
impossible and because they're refusing

726
00:25:57,179 --> 00:26:01,860
to throw rules down and just like

727
00:25:59,909 --> 00:26:03,929
alright follow these apply here and be

728
00:26:01,859 --> 00:26:06,388
done with it they're gonna be doing this

729
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:08,278
nonsense for the next half decade they

730
00:26:06,388 --> 00:26:11,219
need to figure out that loophole of how

731
00:26:08,278 --> 00:26:13,288
people can reimburse the club for the

732
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:15,839
product that they use there right that

733
00:26:13,288 --> 00:26:18,148
is the only that seems to be the lure

734
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:23,069
that like the club has to have a way to

735
00:26:18,148 --> 00:26:26,158
survive and right now a lot of the rules

736
00:26:23,069 --> 00:26:28,589
that are in place are like they can't do

737
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:31,769
anything other than sell prepackaged

738
00:26:28,589 --> 00:26:36,118
drinks and snacks like you can't even do

739
00:26:31,769 --> 00:26:38,730
like cold sandwiches let alone like

740
00:26:36,118 --> 00:26:42,538
decent food it's just nuts

741
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:46,829
um no way to reimburse for the product

742
00:26:42,538 --> 00:26:50,429
like well at that point right how do you

743
00:26:46,829 --> 00:26:51,449
exist as an entity yeah I mean how far

744
00:26:50,429 --> 00:26:53,369
out in the middle of nowhere do they

745
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:54,929
want to push it like eventually it's

746
00:26:53,368 --> 00:26:56,878
just gonna be like it like cousin Earl's

747
00:26:54,929 --> 00:26:59,210
farm and then that's pointless we just

748
00:26:56,878 --> 00:27:03,329
need we like having a place in the

749
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:05,369
congregating area dude with losers in a

750
00:27:03,329 --> 00:27:08,038
big house and a barn in the middle of it

751
00:27:05,368 --> 00:27:09,418
slap up an ad on the Internet to be

752
00:27:08,038 --> 00:27:11,009
honest I've been in those situations

753
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:13,528
I've been out in the middle of nowhere

754
00:27:11,009 --> 00:27:15,749
smoking because we had to hide I've been

755
00:27:13,528 --> 00:27:17,069
to gatherings in every environment you

756
00:27:15,749 --> 00:27:19,470
can imagine you know what I mean from

757
00:27:17,069 --> 00:27:21,450
some random dudes house to some hippies

758
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:23,129
house to some gangsters house to I've

759
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:25,859
been in every environment smoking and

760
00:27:23,128 --> 00:27:27,959
those social clubs are the ideal safest

761
00:27:25,858 --> 00:27:29,908
environment nothing's gonna go wrong I'm

762
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:32,369
not on somebody's turf I'm in a club

763
00:27:29,909 --> 00:27:34,409
it's come on hang up you paid the entry

764
00:27:32,368 --> 00:27:35,788
fee you showed us your ID you're part of

765
00:27:34,409 --> 00:27:37,259
our club we don't have anything against

766
00:27:35,788 --> 00:27:39,839
you nobody here is in a different club

767
00:27:37,259 --> 00:27:42,628
they'd come hang out let's smoke there

768
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:44,398
was a video that I saw years and years

769
00:27:42,628 --> 00:27:47,339
ago where they're interviewing a coffee

770
00:27:44,398 --> 00:27:49,558
shop owner in Amsterdam and that's what

771
00:27:47,339 --> 00:27:52,048
the consumption clubs and Amsterdam are

772
00:27:49,558 --> 00:27:53,428
called and he says he's been open for

773
00:27:52,048 --> 00:27:55,230
like 15 years and he goes there's never

774
00:27:53,429 --> 00:27:56,909
been a fight in here it was the bar

775
00:27:55,230 --> 00:28:00,899
across the street the police are there

776
00:27:56,909 --> 00:28:02,429
every night every night and I mean it's

777
00:28:00,898 --> 00:28:04,469
just a different it's a

778
00:28:02,429 --> 00:28:06,960
prynt type of intoxicant it doesn't come

779
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:09,929
with that aggressive tinge

780
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:11,519
I see anti-pot people linking like

781
00:28:09,929 --> 00:28:13,230
anytime there's a violent incident in

782
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:16,109
marijuana gets mentioned like they post

783
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:17,460
it up though it was directly caused by

784
00:28:16,109 --> 00:28:19,378
and it's like well then you wouldn't had

785
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:21,269
to go to Texas to find this story like

786
00:28:19,378 --> 00:28:23,878
your town sold 17 million dollars were

787
00:28:21,269 --> 00:28:25,710
the weed last year like if it was being

788
00:28:23,878 --> 00:28:31,048
caused you could link that article from

789
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:33,450
pueblo but problems with the clubs are

790
00:28:31,048 --> 00:28:35,579
just they annoy people that really

791
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:37,080
really hate marijuana and that's the

792
00:28:35,579 --> 00:28:39,089
biggest problem caused by allowing

793
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:42,689
consumption clubs is that you annoy the

794
00:28:39,089 --> 00:28:44,730
squeaky wheel I'll give it a few years

795
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:46,558
they're old there's never been a problem

796
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:48,720
it won't be here forever there's never

797
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:50,638
been any trouble there alright I'm gonna

798
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,749
continue with this article joking that

799
00:28:50,638 --> 00:28:53,638
being from Denver shouldn't be held

800
00:28:51,749 --> 00:28:56,308
against him activist attorney Rob Corey

801
00:28:53,638 --> 00:28:58,258
reminded council that amendment 64 which

802
00:28:56,308 --> 00:29:00,210
he had a hand in drafting protects the

803
00:28:58,259 --> 00:29:01,798
activities in question and Colorado

804
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:03,720
adults have the right to associate with

805
00:29:01,798 --> 00:29:05,970
each other consume marijuana cultivate

806
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:07,769
it distribute it and help others with

807
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:09,569
all of those things he said that's the

808
00:29:07,769 --> 00:29:11,220
supreme law of the land the voters have

809
00:29:09,569 --> 00:29:12,808
spoken and just like the other

810
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:14,639
constitutional rights which council

811
00:29:12,808 --> 00:29:16,859
members swore to uphold the rights

812
00:29:14,638 --> 00:29:19,648
afforded by a madman 20 and amendment 64

813
00:29:16,859 --> 00:29:21,898
are non-negotiable Corey said that may

814
00:29:19,648 --> 00:29:24,898
be difficult for you but that is the

815
00:29:21,898 --> 00:29:26,459
reality jill Gaber asked Corey how other

816
00:29:24,898 --> 00:29:28,888
municipalities in the state are dealing

817
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:30,240
with cannabis clubs not a single one has

818
00:29:28,888 --> 00:29:32,308
banned them because they can't he

819
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,990
answered plus a city devoid of videos

820
00:29:32,308 --> 00:29:36,178
for social consumption creates other

821
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:38,038
problems he explained marijuana will be

822
00:29:36,179 --> 00:29:39,778
smoked by adults and groups no matter

823
00:29:38,038 --> 00:29:42,028
what you do you can't prevent me from

824
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:44,009
inviting 50 of my closest friends over

825
00:29:42,028 --> 00:29:45,808
to smoke pot together so where are they

826
00:29:44,009 --> 00:29:48,389
going to go coming soon to a

827
00:29:45,808 --> 00:29:49,618
neighborhood near you yep right yeah if

828
00:29:48,388 --> 00:29:51,359
they ban the clubs we'll just open the

829
00:29:49,618 --> 00:29:52,949
front door bro just come on everybody in

830
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:55,618
everywhere and come just take some

831
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:58,048
damage in my house we're gonna start dad

832
00:29:55,618 --> 00:29:59,668
with some really interesting people we

833
00:29:58,048 --> 00:30:01,499
go that route well that's part of the

834
00:29:59,669 --> 00:30:03,509
beauty of the club I love that because I

835
00:30:01,499 --> 00:30:04,829
mean I would go to the club once or

836
00:30:03,509 --> 00:30:06,298
twice a week I would make an effort to

837
00:30:04,829 --> 00:30:07,740
show up once a week or so honestly it

838
00:30:06,298 --> 00:30:09,240
got to about once every two weeks during

839
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:10,919
trim time because we're just busy but

840
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:12,210
once or twice a week I'll pop in there

841
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:14,100
and try to spend an hour there and say

842
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:15,120
hi to people and I would always meet new

843
00:30:14,099 --> 00:30:16,558
people and

844
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:18,659
sometimes I meet people that I wish

845
00:30:16,558 --> 00:30:20,099
would walk away but most of the day I

846
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:21,870
would meet people I'd be like damn I'm

847
00:30:20,099 --> 00:30:25,289
glad I'm friends with that guy yep

848
00:30:21,869 --> 00:30:27,929
that's I like most of the people I've

849
00:30:25,289 --> 00:30:29,700
met in the community and I wish I could

850
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:31,620
spend more time with consumption clubs

851
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:35,519
and I haven't felt that way about a bar

852
00:30:31,619 --> 00:30:37,289
and forever but the gray area they

853
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:40,589
existed just annoys the [ __ ] out of me

854
00:30:37,289 --> 00:30:43,619
at this point in time like absolutely

855
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:45,209
it's it's just ridiculous at this point

856
00:30:43,619 --> 00:30:46,859
and that the more people don't see this

857
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:49,710
ridiculous is starting to really annoy

858
00:30:46,859 --> 00:30:50,879
me yeah why can we yeah

859
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:52,110
I've said this so many times why can we

860
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,400
have so many bars but we can't have

861
00:30:52,109 --> 00:30:56,159
somewhere to smoke cannabis it seems

862
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:58,530
unfair and they voted to regulate retort

863
00:30:56,160 --> 00:31:02,070
that I always get for that is well you

864
00:30:58,529 --> 00:31:04,289
can enjoy a one alcoholic beverage

865
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:07,529
without getting any sort of intoxication

866
00:31:04,289 --> 00:31:12,539
but every time you consume cannabis its

867
00:31:07,529 --> 00:31:14,789
to get high and it's like well sort of

868
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:16,500
but you can also consume a small amount

869
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:18,149
of cannabis and get no high I do it all

870
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:19,980
the time I do it

871
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:21,870
consuming large amounts of cannabis

872
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:24,230
products when I'm consuming a straight

873
00:31:21,869 --> 00:31:27,109
CBD stuff my first couple of dabs

874
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:29,339
right that's just but like that's

875
00:31:27,109 --> 00:31:32,189
metaphorical consumers like you and me

876
00:31:29,339 --> 00:31:34,259
like one or two high THC dabs there's

877
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:37,620
still no intoxication that's just all

878
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:41,819
sort of pain kill it's different for

879
00:31:37,619 --> 00:31:43,409
everybody and just to make that argument

880
00:31:41,819 --> 00:31:46,289
as though most people don't go to the

881
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:49,440
bar for more than one drink or to feel

882
00:31:46,289 --> 00:31:53,089
some sort of ease relief of stress or

883
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:55,500
blow off some steam or get a nice buzz

884
00:31:53,089 --> 00:31:57,209
like I've been aware of the phrase

885
00:31:55,500 --> 00:32:01,500
three-martini lunch since I was like 5

886
00:31:57,210 --> 00:32:03,808
um it it's just a nonsense argument but

887
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:07,410
I hear it day after day from elected

888
00:32:03,808 --> 00:32:08,970
officials people in suits people whose

889
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:11,340
opinions being printed in the newspaper

890
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:12,990
and it's just nonsense and it's unfair

891
00:32:11,339 --> 00:32:14,609
how come you guys have somewhere to hang

892
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:15,720
out and congregate and drink one drink

893
00:32:14,609 --> 00:32:17,759
and I don't have somewhere to hang out

894
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:19,170
and congregate and take one dab right

895
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:20,789
it's the same damn thing all right I'm

896
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:22,920
gonna continue because there's one more

897
00:32:20,789 --> 00:32:24,240
paragraph it says at the end of his

898
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:26,190
testimony Corey made a show of

899
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,839
delivering the icy attorney a draft

900
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:29,009
lawsuit he intends to file as soon as

901
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:31,619
the mayor signs the club

902
00:32:29,009 --> 00:32:33,329
ordinance on behalf of nine clubs and 14

903
00:32:31,619 --> 00:32:35,038
individuals who own or operate those

904
00:32:33,329 --> 00:32:36,359
clubs the complaint asks for the

905
00:32:35,038 --> 00:32:37,589
ordinance to be struck down for

906
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:39,418
violating plaintiffs rights of

907
00:32:37,589 --> 00:32:41,699
association freedom of speech and due

908
00:32:39,419 --> 00:32:43,740
process under the US Constitution as

909
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:45,269
well as their right to life liberty and

910
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:47,579
the pursuit of happiness

911
00:32:45,269 --> 00:32:49,440
religious freedom and right to medical

912
00:32:47,579 --> 00:32:52,109
and personal use of marijuana under

913
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:53,700
Colorado Constitution councilor dine

914
00:32:52,109 --> 00:32:56,158
took exception to the claim that counsel

915
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:57,509
has no right to ban cannabis clubs we

916
00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:02,549
will talk about that in court

917
00:32:57,509 --> 00:33:05,398
Cory said yeah so what this happened

918
00:33:02,548 --> 00:33:07,558
they had four days to draft the new

919
00:33:05,398 --> 00:33:09,569
rules and have the city attorney sign

920
00:33:07,558 --> 00:33:11,638
them is what I was told and that should

921
00:33:09,569 --> 00:33:13,678
have happened I think the day for that

922
00:33:11,638 --> 00:33:15,569
signing would be today and as soon as

923
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:17,850
that was signed is this tourist of the

924
00:33:15,569 --> 00:33:20,038
velum as soon as the paper was signed is

925
00:33:17,849 --> 00:33:22,888
when the law suit went into so it's the

926
00:33:20,038 --> 00:33:24,388
27th is when the paper will be signed

927
00:33:22,888 --> 00:33:26,548
and that's when the lawsuit will kick in

928
00:33:24,388 --> 00:33:27,778
is what I think I was told it'll be

929
00:33:26,548 --> 00:33:31,109
interesting to watch this will play out

930
00:33:27,778 --> 00:33:32,700
it sure will I do I don't want these

931
00:33:31,109 --> 00:33:35,969
clubs to get closed I want to be able to

932
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:37,740
go hang out like we have rules for them

933
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:39,870
down here it's just none of them are

934
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:42,000
open because essentially the rules mean

935
00:33:39,869 --> 00:33:44,459
it's gonna be a huge upfront investment

936
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:47,659
and the rules also mean they've got to

937
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:50,370
make that investment back with a quarter

938
00:33:47,659 --> 00:33:52,740
profit apiece on like prepackaged bags

939
00:33:50,369 --> 00:33:54,829
of chips and bottled water it's insane

940
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:57,120
yeah and those buildings are expensive

941
00:33:54,829 --> 00:33:58,558
yeah that part of most parts of Colorado

942
00:33:57,119 --> 00:34:00,898
Springs right now are really expensive

943
00:33:58,558 --> 00:34:02,849
all right so I've got one more news

944
00:34:00,898 --> 00:34:04,589
article I want to talk about oh I want

945
00:34:02,849 --> 00:34:07,980
to mention something everybody was

946
00:34:04,589 --> 00:34:09,568
reading a CBD article from Facebook

947
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:12,119
everybody was sharing it the article was

948
00:34:09,568 --> 00:34:13,349
a hoax you guys it got all of us riled

949
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:17,179
up I was looking at it a little further

950
00:34:13,349 --> 00:34:22,588
and that actual article was a hoax

951
00:34:17,179 --> 00:34:25,050
99% of it's a hoax it's based on a truth

952
00:34:22,588 --> 00:34:27,929
though like the FDA did set out warning

953
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:29,669
letters to different CBD companies but

954
00:34:27,929 --> 00:34:32,220
it was my understanding that a lot of

955
00:34:29,668 --> 00:34:34,078
them were the ones you and me were

956
00:34:32,219 --> 00:34:37,138
warning people about a couple of months

957
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:39,030
back right the the Chinese nonsense

958
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:41,250
companies that are like two drops of

959
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:42,540
this superior cancer it's pure CBD and

960
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:44,489
then they test it and it's

961
00:34:42,539 --> 00:34:46,050
your codfish oil or some [ __ ] right well

962
00:34:44,489 --> 00:34:47,369
I read an article on Facebook that was

963
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:50,220
saying that the FDA sent out a letter

964
00:34:47,369 --> 00:34:51,659
saw that that all risa are all CBD

965
00:34:50,219 --> 00:34:54,209
products were banned because it was now

966
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:56,039
FDA regulated right that was not true

967
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:58,409
that was a hoax so if you guys saw that

968
00:34:56,039 --> 00:34:59,789
don't panic that [ __ ] was [ __ ] it

969
00:34:58,409 --> 00:35:01,589
may come down the pipeline in the future

970
00:34:59,789 --> 00:35:02,759
but as of this time that was a hoax I

971
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:04,980
was clickbait people were trying to get

972
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:06,450
you to click and I bought the bait when

973
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:08,280
I read it I was like this isn't written

974
00:35:06,449 --> 00:35:11,399
well it doesn't look right I need to do

975
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:13,530
some research it wasn't true so in a few

976
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:15,480
episodes ago continuingly we've been

977
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:17,400
talking about a raid that happened in

978
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:19,409
Santa Ana California when some police

979
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:21,510
officers raided a dispensary that was

980
00:35:19,409 --> 00:35:22,980
open and full of customers right if you

981
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:26,070
don't know the which raid were talking

982
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:29,579
about hit pause real quick in Google

983
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:31,380
Santa Ana police dispensary raid yes and

984
00:35:29,579 --> 00:35:33,679
I should bring the video right up

985
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:36,450
so these cops were caught on camera

986
00:35:33,679 --> 00:35:38,219
destroying this dispensary they ate what

987
00:35:36,449 --> 00:35:40,079
I thought was edibles on camera but this

988
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:41,819
article covers a little bit it tries to

989
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:42,929
back him up a little bit on that I can't

990
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:43,620
say that they were eating edibles I

991
00:35:42,929 --> 00:35:45,750
wasn't there

992
00:35:43,619 --> 00:35:47,609
this article kind of defends them the

993
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:49,110
headline says Santa Ana cops a notorious

994
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:50,970
pot eating video charged with petty

995
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:53,970
theft and vandalism the article is by

996
00:35:50,969 --> 00:35:56,519
Nick Shu so I'm gonna say it if the

997
00:35:53,969 --> 00:35:59,279
headline calls at the PI video we can go

998
00:35:56,519 --> 00:36:01,320
ahead and yeah it looked like they were

999
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:05,519
eating edibles in the video I would

1000
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:08,940
still say those were edibles the most

1001
00:36:05,519 --> 00:36:10,469
articles OC Weekly it goes like this the

1002
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:12,059

00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:27,059
called sky high holistic damn that

1009
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:29,099
sentence was hard for me I apologize the

1010
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:30,779
video first posted by OC weekly last

1011
00:36:29,099 --> 00:36:32,489
June clearly showed officers passing

1012
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:34,380
around candy bars joking about feeling

1013
00:36:32,489 --> 00:36:36,119
light-headed and tossing darts after

1014
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:37,769
finishing their Scooby Snack the

1015
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:39,750
shocking footage of the sky-high cops

1016
00:36:37,769 --> 00:36:42,300
went viral leading to nationwide and

1017
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:43,860
international news reports yet in its

1018
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:46,590
official announcement of the misdemeanor

1019
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:48,870
charges filed today the OC DA claims

1020
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:50,490
there is no evidence that any of the

1021
00:36:48,869 --> 00:36:52,500
Santa Ana Police Department officers

1022
00:36:50,489 --> 00:36:54,839
shown in the video consumed marijuana

1023
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:56,369
products during the raid instead they're

1024
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:58,499
being prosecuted for causing

1025
00:36:56,369 --> 00:37:02,160
tensional damage to legally disabled

1026
00:36:58,498 --> 00:37:04,528
video cameras and eating detour sample

1027
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:07,230
protein bars and mr. thin stir cookies

1028
00:37:04,528 --> 00:37:08,940
that were not marijuana laced products

1029
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:12,420
on sale at the dispensary but were

1030
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:14,999
simply snacks available to staff I hate

1031
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:18,150
the word laced I hate the word lace too

1032
00:37:14,998 --> 00:37:20,278
but you know basically the good news is

1033
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:23,240
charges were filed the bad news is

1034
00:37:20,278 --> 00:37:25,889
because the video footage is so grainy

1035
00:37:23,239 --> 00:37:27,568
they're claiming or the cops are

1036
00:37:25,889 --> 00:37:31,588
claiming that what they were consuming

1037
00:37:27,568 --> 00:37:34,079
were non infused products that the store

1038
00:37:31,588 --> 00:37:35,969
had on hand for staff and one of their

1039
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:39,240
charges if I remember correctly is

1040
00:37:35,969 --> 00:37:40,798
stealing those food items then yeah

1041
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:44,729

there on purpose and it's being sold as

1054
00:38:08,909 --> 00:38:13,710

we're doing here we are purposely

1061
00:38:21,838 --> 00:38:28,099
writing this thing only happens in crazy

1062
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:30,389
people's minds like it's mostly a myth

1063
00:38:28,099 --> 00:38:32,999
well it's definitely not what

1064
00:38:30,389 --> 00:38:34,230
dispensaries do to do to get their

1065
00:38:32,998 --> 00:38:36,179
customers stoned right

1066
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:39,929

1067
00:38:36,179 --> 00:38:41,190

00:38:46,289 --> 00:38:48,749
Matthew do we want to read all their

1073
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:49,380
names I don't want to glorify them by

1074
00:38:48,748 --> 00:38:51,538
reading their names

1075
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:53,670
another officer also faces an additional

1076
00:38:51,539 --> 00:38:55,440
account of vandalism for damaging the

1077
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:57,989
disabled video cameras and allegedly

1078
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:01,349
smashing their lenses into the corner of

1079
00:38:57,989 --> 00:39:03,210
a display case and cash register okay as

1080
00:39:01,349 --> 00:39:05,338
an extra dick let's go he gets an extra

1081
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:07,318
charge the three defendants are accused

1082
00:39:05,338 --> 00:39:09,210
of consuming the food items and sharing

1083
00:39:07,318 --> 00:39:09,989
the protein bars with other SAPD

1084
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:12,449
personnel

1085
00:39:09,989 --> 00:39:13,979
the press release states before leaving

1086
00:39:12,449 --> 00:39:15,989
the premises at the conclusion of the

1087
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:17,699
search warrant to officers I can't even

1088
00:39:15,989 --> 00:39:19,889
say one of their names are accused of

1089
00:39:17,699 --> 00:39:21,539
taking extra cookies with them the DA's

1090
00:39:19,889 --> 00:39:23,039
office says it concluded a thorough

1091
00:39:21,539 --> 00:39:25,380
investigation of the incident including

1092
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:27,210
the careful review of more than 16 hours

1093
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:31,170
of unedited video surveillance footage

1094
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:33,960
with cooperation of the SAPD while other

1095
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:35,519
SAPD personnel like the bald cop seen in

1096
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:37,858
the video saying he felt lightheaded

1097
00:39:35,519 --> 00:39:42,059
after eating one of them ate some

1098
00:39:37,858 --> 00:39:43,230
protein bars there is unseen sorry I'm

1099
00:39:42,059 --> 00:39:45,059
stuttering on this one there is

1100
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:47,099
insufficient evidence that they knew the

1101
00:39:45,059 --> 00:39:48,659
food items belonged to the dispensary

1102
00:39:47,099 --> 00:39:50,519
and not their fellow officers the

1103
00:39:48,659 --> 00:39:52,469
release states there was also no

1104
00:39:50,519 --> 00:39:54,539
evidence that any SAPD personnel

1105
00:39:52,469 --> 00:39:58,608
consumed any edible marijuana items

1106
00:39:54,539 --> 00:40:01,619
available at the dispensary a minute

1107
00:39:58,608 --> 00:40:03,299
they expect us to believe this [ __ ] well

1108
00:40:01,619 --> 00:40:04,890
the article even says right no evidence

1109
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:06,630
whatsoever other than the fact that the

1110
00:40:04,889 --> 00:40:09,480
cops were at a pot shop eating candy

1111
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:11,010
bars enacting hi one is that one is then

1112
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:12,809
left with the obvious conclusion that

1113
00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:14,849
these poor officers are so underpaid

1114
00:40:12,809 --> 00:40:16,980
that they have no choice but to munch

1115
00:40:14,849 --> 00:40:19,710
down on pilfered protein bars while on

1116
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:22,980
duty that makes so much more sense right

1117
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:25,829
like they broke in they smashed

1118
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:29,760
everything and they they were like Oh

1119
00:40:25,829 --> 00:40:31,588
Chaz brought cookies like to their

1120
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,480
military-style raid like you've seen the

1121
00:40:31,588 --> 00:40:35,250
video they jump out of their SWAT car

1122
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:37,858
and their SWAT gear and they [ __ ]

1123
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:39,889
bang open and unlock [ __ ] door by

1124
00:40:37,858 --> 00:40:41,909
kicking it the wrong way a bunch

1125
00:40:39,889 --> 00:40:44,098
screaming yell at everybody and they're

1126
00:40:41,909 --> 00:40:48,779
like what the dude in the back had

1127
00:40:44,099 --> 00:40:50,190
cookies how are you like how little

1128
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:52,410
attention do they think we're paying

1129
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:54,210
they sit there in the video and talk

1130
00:40:52,409 --> 00:40:57,989
about how they're all woozy from eating

1131
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:59,760
the protein bars they stole like what do

1132
00:40:57,989 --> 00:41:01,289
you see the video and then you look at

1133
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:03,330
these charges and it's like okay the

1134
00:41:01,289 --> 00:41:06,358
rest of that was just legal calm and

1135
00:41:03,329 --> 00:41:07,858
procedure like how is that comment well

1136
00:41:06,358 --> 00:41:10,348
it also says if convicted on all counts

1137
00:41:07,858 --> 00:41:12,750
the trio of uninformed snack fiends

1138
00:41:10,349 --> 00:41:16,320
faces between six months and one year in

1139
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:18,239
jail plus fines so if they do get if

1140
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:20,190
they do go to court they do get a jury

1141
00:41:18,239 --> 00:41:22,259
the jury is gonna watch this video and

1142
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:23,820
convict them if they get real people on

1143
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:28,200
the jury if they don't [ __ ]

1144
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:29,550
to fix that real nice yeah I kind of

1145
00:41:28,199 --> 00:41:30,829
want to see what happens to these guys

1146
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:33,690
if they go to jail

1147
00:41:30,829 --> 00:41:35,759
nothing good cops don't do well in jail

1148
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:37,650
I haven't been there I don't know but I

1149
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,630
could I've seen plenty of movies to know

1150
00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:41,789
that cops are not gonna do well in jail

1151
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:43,710
the behavior is so egregious that we've

1152
00:41:41,789 --> 00:41:47,039
seen it for so long in this community

1153
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:49,230
there's a raid for a dispensary or

1154
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:51,809
whatnot and they come back the day after

1155
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:54,840
the raid with video cameras and

1156
00:41:51,809 --> 00:41:57,000
everything's broken like everything

1157
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:59,789
everything the walls the lights the

1158
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:01,940
lightbulbs the doorknobs everything's

1159
00:41:59,789 --> 00:42:05,610
destroyed the carpets ripped up

1160
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:07,530
electrical wiring is destroyed and it's

1161
00:42:05,610 --> 00:42:09,539
like well this you were serving a search

1162
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:11,400
warrant it's just a display of

1163
00:42:09,539 --> 00:42:13,050
aggression you just came in destroyed

1164
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:15,150
everything ambass you didn't even arrest

1165
00:42:13,050 --> 00:42:16,500
anybody no charges were filed you just

1166
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:17,789
came and took everything destroyed

1167
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:21,329
everything he didn't that isn't worth

1168
00:42:17,789 --> 00:42:24,029
taking and laughed like that's not why

1169
00:42:21,329 --> 00:42:27,769
law enforcement that's piracy that's

1170
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:30,180
terrorism it's insane and

1171
00:42:27,769 --> 00:42:32,269
most of the public school with it

1172
00:42:30,179 --> 00:42:34,799
because they're doing it to the stoners

1173
00:42:32,269 --> 00:42:37,530
the stoners that worked hard to open a

1174
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:39,420
business and try to help in a tribute

1175
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:42,300
thank God it hasn't been a lot of this

1176
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:44,789
these raids in Colorado but I see them

1177
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:49,140
regularly in other states where a

1178
00:42:44,789 --> 00:42:52,529
business has invested years millions of

1179
00:42:49,139 --> 00:42:55,170
dollars to get up running start getting

1180
00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:57,060
successful and then the cops come in

1181
00:42:55,170 --> 00:42:59,789
destroy everything take everything worth

1182
00:42:57,059 --> 00:43:01,949
money and bounce in a year later no

1183
00:42:59,789 --> 00:43:03,690
one's been charged with anything and the

1184
00:43:01,949 --> 00:43:06,329
store is back up and running again yeah

1185
00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:07,889
I mean from my perspective that's why

1186
00:43:06,329 --> 00:43:10,049
they don't want us to use banks cuz

1187
00:43:07,889 --> 00:43:12,619
there's more paperwork to seize a bank

1188
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:14,519
account than to just snatch the saves I

1189
00:43:12,619 --> 00:43:15,119
hadn't thought about it that way that

1190
00:43:14,519 --> 00:43:16,739
sucks

1191
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:18,150
yeah yeah that sounds accurate there's

1192
00:43:16,739 --> 00:43:19,469
more cash in there they just gonna get

1193
00:43:18,150 --> 00:43:21,030
it and buy themselves more armored

1194
00:43:19,469 --> 00:43:23,009
vehicles and Humvees right these are

1195
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:25,170
necessary pens the podcast these

1196
00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:26,460
defendants away by yourself I agree with

1197
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:27,780

1200
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:36,150
waiting for hours in line to vote it's

1201
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:36,690
because I started paying attention and

1202
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:38,550

1203
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:42,950
attention the more caught my attention

1204
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:42,950
