podcast i've been doing a talk about uh

61
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:31,518
feminized seeds i taught you how to make

62
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,439
your silver thiosulfate solution uh we

63
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:36,239
talked more in depth about storing the

64
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:38,878
solution more about application i did

65
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,878
two full episodes on it now we should

66
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:42,959
have made some seeds by now let's talk a

67
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:44,959
little bit about harvesting seeds this

68
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,479
episode is going to be about harvesting

69
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,959
seeded cannabis plants this doesn't

70
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:50,560
really matter if the seeds are regular

71
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,878
seeds if they're femme seeds if they're

72
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,199
autoflowers if they're even hemp seeds

73
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:57,199
this will work for just about any sort

74
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:58,958
of cannabis seeds if they are ready if

75
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:01,518
they're mature if they're ripe this will

76
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:03,120
be an effective method so big up to

77
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,840
everybody who asked me for advice on

78
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:09,200
harvesting seeds this is how i

79
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:11,519
personally harvest my seeded cannabis

80
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:13,280
plants and i'm going for maximum seed

81
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,840
harvester i want as many as i can get as

82
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,560
many healthy seeds so this is how i do

83
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,878
it for commercial one thing i do is i

84
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,318
start checking for the ripeness of the

85
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:24,399
seed we don't want to just chop down a

86
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:25,598
plant if we don't know it's not ready

87
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,959
most of the time we would get a

88
00:03:25,598 --> 00:03:28,479
magnifying glass and we would look at

89
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,439
the trichomes we can't do that here

90
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:30,798
we're not

91
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:32,639
concerned about the trichomes the

92
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:35,200
trichomes honestly do not matter at this

93
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:37,839
point all i care about is the seeds are

94
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:40,798
the seeds ready so what i do is i start

95
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:43,759
pulling seeds out of the plant usually

96
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:46,400
around day 65 or 70 the plants will be

97
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:48,719
ready so about day 60 65

98
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,560
i try not to get too impatient but i do

99
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:52,959
pay attention to each cultivar i will

100
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,640
just start pulling seeds out of the buds

101
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,080
i like to get the top of the plant the

102
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:57,119
middle of the plant and the bottom of

103
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,640
the plant

104
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,080
don't go for those obvious seeds that

105
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:01,759
are sticking up right at the edge of the

106
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,760
bud go for something kind of deeper into

107
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:05,359
the bud that's not protruding out

108
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:06,878
showing you that it's almost ready get a

109
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,400
seed that you actually need to

110
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:09,919
investigate something that hasn't been

111
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,680
getting all of the light something

112
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:13,518
that's a little deeper into the plant

113
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,280
something not prime not ideal that one

114
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,439
will be ready if you find the right seed

115
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,519
it's ready let's find a surprise seed

116
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:21,439
one in the middle uh one in a million

117
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,280
and see what that seed looks like so i

118
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:24,639
will pull the seed out of the nug i'll

119
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:25,839
just reach in there and you can you can

120
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,680
feel it if it's hard enough at this

121
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:29,439
point you can feel it just work its way

122
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,120
out of the bud pull it out get the

123
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:32,639
casing or the hole or the shell whatever

124
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,800
you want to call that part get that

125
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,960
right off of your seed

126
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,680
now we need to visually inspect our seed

127
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:41,918
what color is the seed is it pale if

128
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,240
it's still pale if it's white and pale

129
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:45,680
or grayish it is not ready yet uh

130
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,120
there's a there's two different kinds of

131
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,280
gray there's a gray where it's not ready

132
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,360
and a gray one it's almost too done so

133
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:53,039
if it's light colored uh still soft and

134
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,879
squishy obviously not done is it

135
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,319
starting to get some color to it is it

136
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:58,319
getting tiger striped is it getting

137
00:04:56,319 --> 00:05:00,000
green is it getting brown is it getting

138
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:01,038
is it getting moldy let's pay attention

139
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,879
to all the things that could be

140
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:05,360
happening to the seeds we do have

141
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:07,279
potential of getting powdery mildew bud

142
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,120
rot all those things are still possible

143
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:10,478
when we're breeding with four seed so

144
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,160
let's pay attention make sure we're not

145
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:14,240
getting anything on the seeds and the

146
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,520
plants so let's pull the seeds out see

147
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,319
if they're ripe see what they're looking

148
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:18,159
like

149
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:19,918
when they start feeling hard i give them

150
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,520
what i call the pinch test

151
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:23,519
when they start feeling hard is when it

152
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:25,680
is time to harvest when most of the

153
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:27,918
seeds within that plant feel hard i'll

154
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,439
pull a few out i'll roll them on a hard

155
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:31,198
wooden table this table is fairly hard

156
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:33,839
you can hear me knock on it

157
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,840
that's a hard sturdy solid table a table

158
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:37,038
a countertop something that with no give

159
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:38,959
that's what i would take the seeds and

160
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:40,399
i'd spread a bunch out on the table and

161
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:42,799
press them with my pointer finger and

162
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:44,478
just roll them around crush them if they

163
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,800
crush they're not ready if they don't

164
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:48,478
crush they're probably ready if they

165
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,400
super don't crush you may have gone too

166
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:52,639
far if you let these seeds go too long

167
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:54,799
they will get too hard so i reach into

168
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,879
the bud pull out a few seeds ah roll

169
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,800
them around crush them see what they do

170
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:00,639
when they don't crush anymore when the

171
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,079
majority of the seeds don't crush it is

172
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,519
time to harvest

173
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:05,038
it will be hard

174
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:07,279
excuse me it will be hard to achieve a

175
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:08,560
point where every seed in that plant is

176
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:11,198
optimal

177
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:14,399
just like trichomes we want to go when

178
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:16,240
the majority of the plant is done so we

179
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:18,159
want as many seeds as we can get some of

180
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,240
the seeds will not be done some will be

181
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,759
over ripe but the majority will be

182
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,840
perfect if we take this plant down at

183
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,038
the right time so we find out the seeds

184
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:26,399
are hard we find out they're the right

185
00:06:25,038 --> 00:06:28,399
color they got their tiger stripes

186
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:30,318
they're not crushing it is time to cut

187
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:32,000
them down i usually chop down around day

188
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,080
70 72

189
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,478
in an indoor flowering run that's if

190
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:37,839
pollen happened around the right time

191
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:40,159
i did a previous episode to tell you

192
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:42,000
about that so um chop when they're ready

193
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:45,039
that's what it says here chaplain ready

194
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,879
before i chop i do a heavy defoliation i

195
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:48,478
go in and i pull off as many leaves as i

196
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:50,319
can possibly remove

197
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:52,639
because this is going to help speed up

198
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:55,199
the drying process this is going to help

199
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,478
drastically speed up the sorting process

200
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,400
we don't want to sort through a bunch of

201
00:06:56,478 --> 00:07:00,478
leaves we're going to turn this all into

202
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:03,279
a powdery dust eventually and get the

203
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:05,598
seeds out so um pull off all the leaves

204
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:07,519
that you can defoliate heavily before

205
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:09,279
you cut the plants down

206
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:11,279
then after they're naked i will cut them

207
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:13,598
down i've got a couple of different ways

208
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:16,000
to do this depending on space uh where i

209
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:18,079
am the environment uh sometimes if i'm

210
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,160
working with a bunch of plants of one

211
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:22,318
strain and all of the seeds in there are

212
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,160
going to be the same seeds i will lay a

213
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,199
tarp on the floor maybe some panda film

214
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,039
on the floor

215
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,560
one time i just used a big trash can lid

216
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:30,879
and let that catch any seeds that may

217
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,478
fall out then i just hang the plants

218
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:34,399
from the ceiling i use either fishing

219
00:07:32,478 --> 00:07:35,680
line or one time i was in a basement i

220
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:37,839
just used a bunch of little eye hooks

221
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,079
and screwed them at the basement ceiling

222
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:41,439
into the rafters down there but uh

223
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:43,120
hang the plants up that's the point here

224
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:44,800
get the plants hanging so that they're

225
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,478
going to dry don't let them hang too

226
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,400
long because they will get dry and seeds

227
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:50,639
will begin to fall out

228
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:52,560
if you've got sea if you've got plants

229
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,918
they will fit in rubbermaid tubs i've

230
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,000
got these rubbermaid tubs they're

231
00:07:53,918 --> 00:07:58,399
approximately i'm going to guess they're

232
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,399
three feet long by two feet wide by 18

233
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:02,159
inches tall they've got a lid on them i

234
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:04,000
do not put the lid on them but they do

235
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,840
come with the lid sometimes i'll chop

236
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,680
down the plant and just put the entire

237
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:09,279
plant right inside of that tub just let

238
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,120
it sit right in there

239
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:12,638
i'm not really concerned about drying

240
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,360
and curing this product this isn't going

241
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,879
to be weed i want seeds out of here so i

242
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,960
don't put it in a beautiful environment

243
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:21,120
a nice condition or anything it goes

244
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:23,120
wherever it can go sometimes it goes in

245
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,280
the grow room in the corner so that it

246
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,439
gets warm and dry i just need these

247
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:29,439
plants to dry up quickly that's all i'm

248
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:31,279
worried about so i cut them down hang

249
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:32,799
them off the seeds start popping out

250
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:34,718
then i'll drop them into that tupperware

251
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:36,958
container or that rubbermaid or sterlite

252
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,959
bin i've got them in there you can do it

253
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:40,718
a lot of different ways as long as

254
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:42,478
your plants are isolated if you've got

255
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,720
more than one strain if you've got more

256
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,320
than one female that has been pollinated

257
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,399
keep them separate so you don't cross

258
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:51,278
the seeds up and get those confused i

259
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:53,120
make very uh strong efforts to keep all

260
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:55,039
of my seeds separate because my seeds go

261
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,240
out for commercial use i want people to

262
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:57,599
get what they think they're getting i

263
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,720
want the packages to be labeled

264
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,720
correctly

265
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,800
and that takes effort from the beginning

266
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,680
so i've got my plants down they get into

267
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:07,599
their bins they get dry dry dry

268
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:10,319
to speed up this drying process i will

269
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,320
take the buds off of the sticks i put on

270
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,760
some gloves they're not super thick

271
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,839
gloves they're just thin leather gloves

272
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:18,240
sometimes i can do it bare-handed if the

273
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,279
buds are just moist enough just dry

274
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,720
enough it'll work beautifully

275
00:09:19,278 --> 00:09:23,200
bare-handed but here's what we're gonna

276
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,040
do grab the stick and just put your hand

277
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,200
around that stalk and just pull and

278
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:29,759
knock the buds right off the stick into

279
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,839
your uh five gallon bucket your sterlite

280
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:33,200
bin your rubbermaid tote just get those

281
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,040
buds right off of there we don't need

282
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,560
that stick in there we're not gonna dry

283
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:38,958
and cure anything we're not making

284
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:40,719
smokeable flour we're after nothing but

285
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:42,319
seeds at this point

286
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,320
now some of you out there may want to

287
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,080
make concentrates or edibles or

288
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,760
something with the material that comes

289
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,480
from the seeds

290
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:53,360
i do not do that i am focused on

291
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,560
strictly seed production seed movement i

292
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,720
don't care about all the stuff that

293
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:58,319
comes out all the material the chaff is

294
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,440
what i think we call it the junk the

295
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,440
trash

296
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,680
that honestly goes in the compost pile

297
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,079
or in the bokashi bucket and it gets

298
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:08,719
reused it gets turned back into minerals

299
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:10,239
for plant growth for compost uh goes out

300
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,000
in the yard gets the plants outside not

301
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,639
the ganja plants but the

302
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,120
the normal yard looks real good because

303
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:18,559
of that stuff so um i honestly beat the

304
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,078
[ __ ] out of it it's so beat up by the

305
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:21,679
time i'm done that there's any

306
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:23,919
concentrates we've made with it come out

307
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:25,759
green and funky and gross and i don't

308
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:28,159
make edibles myself so it's not worth my

309
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:30,240
time i throw it all away so i pulled the

310
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:32,240
buds off the sticks i got a five gallon

311
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,000
bucket or a tote filled with just little

312
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,159
tiny buds and they're getting drier by

313
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,240
the day my reasoning is i want to get

314
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:39,600
these seeds dried i want to get them out

315
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,278
of these buds and i want to get them

316
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,920
packaged and get them out to either

317
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:45,838
testers or vendors basically as soon as

318
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:47,439
possible there's no good in them sitting

319
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:49,040
there no product does you any good

320
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,800
sitting in a garage sitting on a shelf

321
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:52,719
sitting in a room we got to get it

322
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:54,958
somewhere so i want to get this going as

323
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,879
quickly as possible so i get the sticks

324
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:58,799
out of the buds i get the buds as small

325
00:10:56,879 --> 00:11:00,720
as i can get them occasionally when i

326
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:02,078
walk by i'll just put my hands in there

327
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,759
and just break up those buds even

328
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:06,078
smaller because smaller buds more

329
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:07,439
surface area they will dry more quickly

330
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:09,120
give them a stir

331
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,640
mix up that stuff get the air out of

332
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,278
there get the moisture out of there

333
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:15,039
speed them up get them dry dry dry

334
00:11:13,278 --> 00:11:17,600
once they are completely dry this is

335
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:19,278
when the fun begins i want it dry to

336
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,839
where if it was weed you'd be mad that

337
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:23,519
it got that dry but said this before i'm

338
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,519
not worried about the weed at all i'm

339
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,679
only worried about the beans which are

340
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:30,078
inside of those flowers so we're gonna

341
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:32,319
get it bone dusty dry

342
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:34,799
now we've got a couple of options uh

343
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,640
sometimes i'll use a five gallon bucket

344
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:38,799
and i just put on gloves and it depends

345
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:40,078
on how much material there is i may just

346
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:42,159
get in there with my fingers and my

347
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:44,000
hands and just do this remove and just

348
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:46,078
rub the buds and just grind it all up

349
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,240
and crush it up with my hands until it's

350
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:50,239
a fine dust i'm not gonna go hard enough

351
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,000
to crush or break or disrupt or rupture

352
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,919
or destroy any of the seeds that are in

353
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,278
there but the herb is so dry that i can

354
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:57,199
just rub it with my hands and it'll

355
00:11:55,278 --> 00:11:58,879
start crumbling up into dust you can

356
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,800
hear the seeds land back into the bucket

357
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:02,078
ding ding ding ding ting ting it sounds

358
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:03,599
like it's raining into the bucket if

359
00:12:02,078 --> 00:12:05,599
you've done it right you get a bunch of

360
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,920
seeds out of there another method that

361
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,680
i've seen people do and somebody's gonna

362
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:11,838
say this is crazy but i learned it from

363
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:14,399
a crazy person big respect to my buddy

364
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:16,399
who showed me this uh at this store at

365
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:19,278
the hardware store they sell what is

366
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:21,120
called a paint paddle for your drill you

367
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:22,639
can get a power drill and they put a

368
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,799
thing on there that is meant to stir

369
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:26,959
paint it looks like a propeller for a

370
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:28,159
boat or something similar to that and

371
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:29,919
it's supposed to get down into the

372
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:30,958
bottom of a bucket of paint and stir it

373
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:32,879
and then you move it up and down and

374
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:35,119
stir your paint i've seen somebody put

375
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:37,838
that on a drill and stick it in the five

376
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,120
gallon bucket of buds with seeds in it

377
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:40,639
excuse me for the throat clearing you

378
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,639
guys i took a couple of monster dabs and

379
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,799
it's got my throat choked up but uh we

380
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,159
take the uh the paint stirrer put it on

381
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:47,919
a medium-low setting you don't want to

382
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:49,519
get in there and full-on like destroy

383
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:51,039
the seeds but like a medium-low setting

384
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:53,039
to where it's spinning and let it hit

385
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:54,639
the buds and if the buds are dry enough

386
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:56,559
they basically just crumble under that

387
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:59,440
drill under that flower bit under the

388
00:12:56,559 --> 00:13:00,799
stirrer bit it just crushes them not bad

389
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,160
enough to destroy the seeds that's

390
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:03,359
something we need to focus on if you're

391
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:05,199
going to put a drill bit in there if

392
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:08,000
you're going to use something mechanical

393
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,440
do not crush the seeds be gentle be

394
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,440
pay attention is the word i'm trying to

395
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:14,079
say so the main objective is to get it

396
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,040
super dry and then crumble it up into a

397
00:13:14,078 --> 00:13:17,039
dry

398
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:18,879
dusty mess you've got a bunch of weed

399
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:21,039
with a bunch of seeds in it now we've

400
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:22,720
got a container with weed and seeds now

401
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:24,879
we've got to separate that here is the

402
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,120
funnest part of the game in my opinion

403
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:28,480
this is almost the same as trimming i

404
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,799
don't have to trim because i just turned

405
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,079
all my weed into seeds and dust this is

406
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:33,919
my version of trimming and then

407
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:36,159
packaging seeds is also my version of

408
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:37,599
trimming can't complain about that but

409
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:39,919
this is the next step we've got to

410
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,560
remove all the beans from all of that

411
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:44,078
weed luckily gravity will work for us

412
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:45,439
for a lot of this if you've got a the

413
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:47,198
right kind of container you can tip it

414
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,440
to one side and most of your seeds will

415
00:13:47,198 --> 00:13:51,120
roll to the corner that you've tipped it

416
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,120
to if you've done it right if you've

417
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,198
used a container that is tall enough

418
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,560
wide enough deep enough and not if it's

419
00:13:55,198 --> 00:13:58,799
the right shape you may be able to reach

420
00:13:56,559 --> 00:14:00,479
in with your hand and pull out most of

421
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:02,319
the material and leave all of the seeds

422
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,639
at the bottom help yourself out and just

423
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,959
start scooping it out the best you can

424
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:08,799
then we've got a couple of options

425
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:10,879
the most affordable and effective way of

426
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:12,958
course is that old school way just get

427
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:14,159
an album cover or something a lot of

428
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:16,000
people have no idea what i'm even

429
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:17,919
talking about get a magazine something

430
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,198
flat and just tip it up on one edge and

431
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:21,120
let the seeds run out and let that

432
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:22,639
heavier material stay if you tip

433
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,560
something up and if you put the seeds on

434
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:26,079
a tray or a magazine or something and

435
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:27,919
you tip it the seeds will roll down and

436
00:14:26,078 --> 00:14:29,278
the weed will stay there you can do that

437
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:30,719
a couple of times and clean it up that's

438
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:32,958
the old school way if you've made a lot

439
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,879
of seeds that will drive you crazy i

440
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:37,599
possibly could never do that i would

441
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:39,120
never ever finish sorting seeds um

442
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,000
there's another way to do it you can get

443
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:44,720
a flower sifter from your local grocery

444
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,120
store or the mart down the street

445
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,879
it's a sifter it looks like a net with a

446
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,120
plastic ring around it and a handle but

447
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:52,480
it's a mash net a metal net you throw

448
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,720
the material and the seeds in there and

449
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,320
gently rub it around over another bowl

450
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,560
the material will fall out of the bottom

451
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,879
the seeds will remain in the top you've

452
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:01,919
got your seeds that way wear some rubber

453
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:03,439
gloves because your fingers are going to

454
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:05,039
get all chafed and all funky from that

455
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,720
it's going to take a while that's a

456
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:08,879
frustrating process if you don't have a

457
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,720
lot of seeds that will get her done

458
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:13,120
if you have a lot of seeds this is when

459
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,560
the job does get harder i've seen uh

460
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,240
shout out to masonic smoker i haven't

461
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:17,759
seen this method in a long time it

462
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,440
wasn't the first one that i saw do it

463
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:21,679
but i forgot all about it

464
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,839
mace took a container that had herb and

465
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:25,519
seeds in it and he just gingerly turned

466
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,279
on the shopvac and just kind of

467
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:29,278
feathered the top of the the weed and

468
00:15:27,278 --> 00:15:31,120
the material and pulled out the weed and

469
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:32,399
just kind of gingerly tipped it around

470
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,240
and moved it to where none of the seeds

471
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,519
were getting sucked up but the weed was

472
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,278
getting removed from the container he

473
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:39,360
got most of it out that way then went

474
00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:41,759
back just kind of hand clean it that's a

475
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:44,800
super easy way to do it the other way to

476
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:46,800
do it is a seed sorting machine there

477
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:49,120
are numerous seed sorting machines

478
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:50,799
available on the internet my favorite is

479
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,799
the small device it looks like a white

480
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:54,559
shoe box it's got two drawers on the

481
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:56,799
front of it it's got a spot you pour in

482
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:58,399
the material but the [ __ ] seeds come

483
00:15:56,799 --> 00:16:00,078
out on one side the material comes out

484
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:02,000
on the other it's [ __ ] magic inside

485
00:16:00,078 --> 00:16:04,399
there i love that machine it's great

486
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,078
there is another one that is much larger

487
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:08,240
it hooks up to a shop vac it's a little

488
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:10,399
bit cumbersome if you're making a bunch

489
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,240
of seeds that one is effective for you

490
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,159
that's overkill for me and i make a lot

491
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,320
of seeds it just takes up a lot of space

492
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:17,919
and you need the shopvac also

493
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,079
the little white square piece it's a

494
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:22,078
standalone unit it's got a computer fan

495
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:24,078
in there it works beautifully the best

496
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:26,719
part about both of those seed separating

497
00:16:24,078 --> 00:16:28,879
devices is there are very simple

498
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,399
blueprints and plans all over the

499
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:32,720
internet so if you need a seed sorting

500
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:34,559
machine there are blueprints plans

501
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,120
guides all over the internet i think my

502
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:38,958
friend cascadian groan for a while was

503
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,399
making seed sorting machines i do

504
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:42,879
approve of those those are quality

505
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:44,720
devices check out cascadian grown on the

506
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:46,240
social media uh if you're in the weed

507
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,240
scene the cannabis crew you know how to

508
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,519
find them if you're new uh follow my

509
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,600
social media let me know you need to

510
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:52,959
find cascadia and we'll get you in touch

511
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,079
honestly don't know if he's still making

512
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:55,198
him but he's a good dude and i want to

513
00:16:54,078 --> 00:16:57,198
give him a plug if i've got an

514
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:58,719
opportunity because he would give me a

515
00:16:57,198 --> 00:17:00,479
plug if he had the opportunity because

516
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:03,120
that's what family does all right where

517
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,720
the hell are we i got rambly

518
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,919
you can definitely make your own seed

519
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:09,360
sorting machine uh sorting seeds um

520
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,640
counting seeds sorting seeds that's

521
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:12,719
another thing that i would recommend is

522
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:15,360
buy yourself a seed counter i think

523
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,640
they're about 350 to 450 bucks depending

524
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,000
on the quality

525
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,000
that you get and of course how quickly

526
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,038
you get it shipped uh find one that'll

527
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,359
ship it to you for free if you're

528
00:17:21,038 --> 00:17:25,439
spending that much money um but a seed

529
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:26,798
counter is ideal i love just putting the

530
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,558
seeds in the seed counter and watching

531
00:17:26,798 --> 00:17:30,720
it turn it doesn't spin it looks like it

532
00:17:28,558 --> 00:17:32,160
spins its vibration i love watching the

533
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,440
seeds spin up the little thing and into

534
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,000
the shoot and show me how many seeds

535
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,279
i've got so much better than guessing uh

536
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,119
once you've done it a lot of times

537
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:41,279
you'll get a good guess but it's so much

538
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:42,879
better then i can do inventory like this

539
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:44,240
beep and they go

540
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,880
and then it tells me how many seeds are

541
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:49,599
there so awesome uh so get yourself a

542
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:52,559
seed sorting machine or get yourself a

543
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:54,319
um a sifter or an album cover or some

544
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:55,440
way to get the seeds out have a strategy

545
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:57,439
there

546
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,600
maybe if you don't destroy that weed so

547
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,600
badly by using the sorting machine and

548
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:02,798
all the [ __ ] that i do to it you may be

549
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:04,959
able to make something out of that

550
00:18:02,798 --> 00:18:06,160
leftover weed i never intend to i never

551
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,000
plan to

552
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,440
i just straight up pollinate everything

553
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,679
destroy the whole plant get all the

554
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,038
seeds out then uh since i have a seed

555
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,640
company i guess i just use the funding

556
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:16,079
from the seed company to buy the

557
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,799
concentrates and the edibles which i

558
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:21,759
would enjoy that's my strategy there

559
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:23,200
um so let it get real dry crumble it up

560
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:24,640
uh once it's crumbled up that's when

561
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,720
you've got some decisions to make are

562
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,600
you going to use the sifter or how are

563
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,640
you going to crumple it you're going to

564
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:30,480
use a drill you're going to use your

565
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,320
gloves i've seen people put it in a

566
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,160
baggie and just stomp on the baggie a

567
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:35,839
lot or mash the bag you with their hands

568
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,279
as long as you get that weed real dry it

569
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:38,240
will work then

570
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:39,678
figure out how you're going to get the

571
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,679
seeds out you're going to use the sifter

572
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,440
the machine you're going to use gravity

573
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:44,880
you're going to use a vacuum get those

574
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,798
seeds out

575
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,720
wear gloves i recommend gloves also if

576
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:50,558
you're going to use the seed sorting

577
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,480
machines maybe a mask because it blows a

578
00:18:50,558 --> 00:18:53,759
lot of dust around you do get the green

579
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,038
boogers from that which are never

580
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:57,440
pleasant

581
00:18:55,038 --> 00:18:59,839
then very important once the seeds are

582
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:02,240
out of the material label them whatever

583
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:04,399
baggy jar whatever it goes into make

584
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,240
sure that gets labeled properly i like

585
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,400
to label it what the male plant was the

586
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,319
female plant was what the cross is

587
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,840
called and the date of the harvest that

588
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:13,439
way i kind of have an idea how old those

589
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:15,359
seeds are when they came out of the

590
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,880
plants lets me know what's going on now

591
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:18,879
if there's a problem i know that it came

592
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:21,039
from this batch uh just helps me out

593
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:23,200
with a little bit of uh just helps me

594
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:25,519
out that's all um then the best part

595
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,880
grow the seeds grow these seeds you've

596
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:28,879
made some cool seeds you've got them out

597
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,720
of your buds now you've got to grow them

598
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,559
before you sell them share them pass

599
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,960
them along grow them make sure you

600
00:19:32,558 --> 00:19:36,319
didn't just make total garbage don't ask

601
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,400
for money for seeds that you haven't

602
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:40,159
tested because who knows what you've got

603
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,400
uh could be all boys it could be all

604
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:45,038
intersex it could be mutants or

605
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:47,759
or maybe you just made the new hottest

606
00:19:45,038 --> 00:19:49,519
fire on the market store your seeds in a

607
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:51,119
cool dry dark place by now they should

608
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:52,798
be super dry

609
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:54,959
if you followed my method the seeds are

610
00:19:52,798 --> 00:19:56,480
dry they're ready to be stored but make

611
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,798
sure they're nice and dry before you do

612
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:01,200
seal them up if not you do risk the

613
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:02,720
opportunity for mold and pathogens in

614
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,960
your seeds so let them go let them get

615
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:07,679
nice and dry then label them correctly

616
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,558
and store them in a cool dry

617
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:12,400
dark

618
00:20:08,558 --> 00:20:15,519
place i think that does wrap up my seed

619
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:17,038
harvest episode um if you have any more

620
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:18,480
questions about harvesting seeds maybe

621
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:20,798
we should talk a little bit about seed

622
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:23,440
storage let's write that down storage

623
00:20:20,798 --> 00:20:25,440
may be an upcoming episode because that

624
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,120
seems like the next logical step all
