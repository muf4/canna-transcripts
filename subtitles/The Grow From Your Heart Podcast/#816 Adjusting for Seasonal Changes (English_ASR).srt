about a vacation I recently took then

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,280
we're going to talk a little bit about

15
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:51,079
adjusting our grow room for the upcoming

16
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,679
winter conditions if you live in the

17
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:54,799
United States we are now shifting from

18
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:56,399
that warm summer season to the cooler

19
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:58,238
fall season so it is time to make some

20
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,160
adjustments in the grow we'll talk more

21
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:01,839
about that in just a minute I I want to

22
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:04,920
start the show by talking about a little

23
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,680
vacation that I got to take last week I

24
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,680
got to go to Las Vegas and see a

25
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:11,640
festival called skankfest Let Me Explain

26
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,640
skankfest is not exactly what it sounds

27
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,159
like but it is close to what it sounds

28
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:18,200
like I am a big fan of a podcast called

29
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,520
the Legion of skanks Legion of skanks is

30
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:23,280
one of my favorite podcasts it is hosted

31
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:25,319
by LS J Gomez big J oakerson and Dave

32
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,840
Smith a lot of times they have a lot of

33
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:29,478
great comedians as guests on our podcast

34
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,560
most of the time it's uh East Coast

35
00:01:29,478 --> 00:01:32,280
comic

36
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,920
those guys aren't as gentle and fluffy

37
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,118
as some of the other guys I like the

38
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,159
rude crass humor that these guys put out

39
00:01:36,118 --> 00:01:40,239
so the Legion of skanks threw a festival

40
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,399
called skankfest this was their seventh

41
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:44,438
skankfest they've thrown this was the

42
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:46,320
second one that happened in Las Vegas

43
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:49,118
and when I saw the lineup I knew that I

44
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:51,000
had to go to this party skankfest was

45
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:52,799
amazing I could start listing comedians

46
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,519

47
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,079

48
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:59,438

64
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,400
match the competitors were blindfolded

65
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:35,479
and wearing shock collars and the

66
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:37,640
controllers of these shock collars were

67
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:39,919
given to random members of the audience

68
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:41,839
and then the guys were put into a boxing

69
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:44,399
ring and they were fighting a sort of

70
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,878

173
00:06:10,478 --> 00:06:15,719

174
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:17,759
comedians playing at a 10,000 seat venue

175
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:20,080

176
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:23,000

177
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:25,478

178
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,918

180
00:06:26,918 --> 00:06:30,719
bunch of white people music for a bunch

181
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:32,839
of white people but DJ cipa sounds got

182
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,759
us dancing it was a good time and then

183
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:37,198
Dan Soder came out did about 10 minutes

184
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:39,038
of Amazing comedy his set was awesome

185
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,439
big J oerson came out you could tell

186
00:06:39,038 --> 00:06:43,839
that big J was still fried from

187
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:46,038
skankfest we both had skankfest voice

188
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:48,519
and energy it was like we both needed a

189
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:50,120
nap but it was well worth it then after

190
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:52,598
big J crushed the stage for a few

191
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:55,240
minutes Bert ker came out and did an

192
00:06:52,598 --> 00:06:57,360

194
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,639

195
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:03,079
to tell other stories and other jokes uh

196
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:05,038
Bert was lighting joints and passing

209
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,160
about skankfest I want to look at my

210
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:34,359
notes saw crer oh it says here I got

211
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:36,039

212
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:39,160
I didn't do anything weird in Las Vegas

213
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:40,839

214
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,759
major sinus infection I had a chest

215
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:44,158
congestion problem so if I do sound a

216
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:45,598
little shitty here on the podcast I

217
00:07:44,158 --> 00:07:47,519
apologize I can hear it in my nose just

218
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:49,839
a little bit uh but I'm not going to let

219
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:52,120
that slow me down it took me uh several

220
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:53,758
days to get my [ __ ] back in Action here

221
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,399
so uh this is going to be a short

222
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,400
podcast not a lot of details and we're

223
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:59,439
not going to talk too much about highly

224
00:07:57,399 --> 00:08:00,799
detailed growing because my voice may

225
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:03,120
not be well and I don't want to waste a

226
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,478
good show with a crappy voice all right

227
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,280
that's enough about

228
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:08,878

would appreciate it if you join us on

314
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:04,200
the Discord server and in the Discord

00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:05,679
server there's a tab for every strain

316
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,360
that I have put out most of the strains

317
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:09,559

318
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,278
new and unreleased tab but if you scroll

319
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:13,159
through the tabs there's a blueberry

327
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:28,079
there and I highly encourage you to post

328
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:30,120
your grow progress in those tabs that

329
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:31,638
does a lot of things for us then new

330
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,600
Growers that want to grow that strain

331
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:34,320
they can go there and have a

332
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:36,519
conversation with people growing that

333
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,760
plant they can say hey I'm growing Big

334
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:39,200
Mountain fudge cake let's go to the

335
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:41,200
Discord and look and they can see all

336
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,800
the previous grows that people are doing

337
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,720
they can talk about which phenotypes

338
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:46,559
they got how long they took uh what

339
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,480
anomalies they saw if the plant needed

340
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:50,078
any extra feeding or attention that

341
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,839
should all be right there in the Discord

342
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:54,519
so I invite you and encourage you to

343
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:56,959
come join us on the Discord server also

344
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:59,200
people who post impressive photos on the

345
00:11:56,958 --> 00:12:01,359
Discord end up with free seeds because I

346
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,399
want more impressive photos so join us

347
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,720
on the Discord post those grow report

348
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:08,958
photos and maybe just maybe I will send

349
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:10,839
you more free seeds all right now let's

350
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:13,319
talk about the important part of this

351
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:15,920
podcast let's talk about adjusting our

352
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:18,399
grow room from the summer conditions to

353
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:20,719
the upcoming winter conditions I am in

354
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:23,639
Colorado for the past 3 months it has

355
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:27,680
been 90° in the next week it is going to

356
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:29,440
shift from 90° to about 65° days very

357
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:32,120
quickly here that means I'm need to make

358
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:34,000
adjustments in my grow space how am I

359
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:35,639
going to compensate for the drop in

360
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,958
temperatures the first thing I'm going

361
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:39,159
to do is I'm going to remove my air

362
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:40,919
conditioner I don't need the air

363
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:42,719
conditioner in that grow space right now

364
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:44,559
it is already cold enough so the air

365
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,199
conditioner is coming out to replace

366
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:49,559
that air conditioner I'm going to hang

367
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:51,078
up a 1,000 watt high-press sodium lamp

368
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:52,638
and that is going to keep my grow space

369
00:12:51,078 --> 00:12:55,239
warm a lot of people say bro you're a

370
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:57,919
dinosaur that's old technology yes I

371
00:12:55,240 --> 00:13:01,320
agree but here in Colorado last year we

372
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:04,078
got about negative 15 -7° and that is

373
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:06,040
freaking cold having that HPS lamp in my

374
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:08,120
room will help keep the room warm when

375
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:10,120
it gets that cold and also it's adding

376
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,679
more light I could put a heater in there

377
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,440
but all the heater is going to do is

378
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:15,399
make more heat I can put a light in

379
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,000
there use the light to generate heat use

380
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:18,879
the heat to heat the room and I'm

381
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,759
getting more light so that is my

382
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:23,159
strategy I took out the air conditioner

383
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:24,360
and I have added one big light to create

384
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:26,078
some heat in that grow room if it

385
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:28,039
doesn't get warm enough guess what I'll

386
00:13:26,078 --> 00:13:30,519
add another light in there because a

387
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:32,599
heater in my opinion is a great idea but

388
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:34,720
that's just heat if I can get two things

389
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:36,278
out of making heat why not make light

390
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,079
increase the amount of light in the room

391
00:13:36,278 --> 00:13:39,559
that's what the plants want anyway so

392
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:42,319
I'm going to use those grow lights to

393
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:44,919
keep the grow room warm the next thing I

394
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,519
did was I took out the dehumidifier I

395
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:48,439
don't need that dehumidifier right now

396
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:50,399
it's not super hot outside I'm not

397
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:52,639
getting super high uh humid conditions

398
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:55,519
in the room instead since it is cold and

399
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:57,799
dry outside I am now adding a humidifier

400
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:59,278
so I have swapped my cold source for a

401
00:13:57,799 --> 00:14:01,838
heat source and now I have swapped my

402
00:13:59,278 --> 00:14:03,919
dehue for a hue those are the big major

403
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:05,399
shifts that I have done in that room now

404
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:07,159
I don't know how you have your ducting

405
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:08,799
setup but if you are in the right

406
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:10,838
environment in the right place maybe you

407
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:12,958
can turn your ducting around and bring

408
00:14:10,839 --> 00:14:14,839
in some of that cool air and cool that

409
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:16,879
hot room if you've got a hot room so

410
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:18,560
these are just a couple of basic ideas

411
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:20,278
that I think about when winter starts

412
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:21,919
coming let's turn off that air

413
00:14:20,278 --> 00:14:23,559
conditioner let's hang up another light

414
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:25,879
let's get rid of the dehumidifier and

415
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:27,119
add hum a humidifier I don't know your

416
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:29,120
grow room and I don't know your

417
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,639
situation but let's think about ways we

418
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,480
can optimize that grow room for the

419
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:35,799
seasons another thing to think about is

420
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:38,079
are your plants on the floor in your

421
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:40,000
grow space think about it this way that

422
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:41,758
floor if you've got a grow room in a

423
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,879
basement if you've got a grow room in a

424
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:45,919
garage a room that's not insulated how

425
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:47,679
cold is that floor getting can you take

426
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:50,278
off your shoes and socks and stand on

427
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:52,078
that floor comfortably if you can't the

428
00:14:50,278 --> 00:14:54,240
plants cannot either that is like having

429
00:14:52,078 --> 00:14:56,198
their feet or their balls sitting on a

430
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,399
cold floor and then we're going to add

431
00:14:56,198 --> 00:15:00,319
water to that pot now we got cold wet

432
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:02,159
feet eaten balls on a cold flooor those

433
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,120
plants are not going to be happy my

434
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:06,159
advice is to lift those plants up off

435
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:08,120
the ground some way either build a

436
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:10,039
little table build a tray or if you've

437
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:12,360
just got a few plants a very easy method

438
00:15:10,039 --> 00:15:14,039
is to buy more pots of the same size and

439
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:16,360
flip them upside down if you got a three

440
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:17,759
gallon pot get another 3 gallon pot flip

441
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,879
it upside down and put your plant right

442
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:21,360
on top of that now your plant is up off

443
00:15:19,879 --> 00:15:22,958
of the ground and actually a little bit

444
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,039
closer to the light which may be a good

445
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:26,758
thing for you so think about those plant

446
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:28,879
roots are they cold are they going to

447
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:31,278
get real cold when you water and another

448
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:33,439
thing to consider is how cold is the

449
00:15:31,278 --> 00:15:35,919
water that you are feeding these plants

450
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,600
my water pipes run uh along the outside

451
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:38,958
of my house so when it's cold outside

452
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,319
the water coming out is naturally

453
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:43,198
freaking cold I like to run that water

454
00:15:41,318 --> 00:15:45,159
fill up my containers whether it's a

455
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:47,078
trash can some buckets or a reservoir

456
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:48,799
whatever you're using fill that up and

457
00:15:47,078 --> 00:15:51,239
then I put it in the grow room under the

458
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:53,000
grow lights for several hours to warm up

459
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,639
that way when I water it that water is

460
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,278
not super cold I would not recommend

461
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:59,879
feeding water colder than 69 or 70° to

462
00:15:58,278 --> 00:16:01,720
our plants that will have detrimental

463
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:04,240
effects to the plants so let's think

464
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:06,240
about the ways that we can utilize and

465
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,039
optimize our grow room for this seasonal

466
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,198
change another thing we can think about

467
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:12,360
is what are you doing with the heat from

468
00:16:10,198 --> 00:16:13,838
your grow space if the grow space is

469
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:16,079
warm enough and you need to get rid of

470
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:18,199
some of that heat are you ducting that

471
00:16:16,078 --> 00:16:20,120
that heat into a living space within the

472
00:16:18,198 --> 00:16:22,039
house don't send the heat right out the

473
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:24,278
house outside out the attic outside

474
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:25,958
through a window or something it's cold

475
00:16:24,278 --> 00:16:28,278
we need that heat you can utilize that

476
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:29,919
heat you paid for it uh however if the

477
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:31,679
light generated the heat if the heater

478
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:33,479
generated the heat you're paying for it

479
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:35,439
via electricity so let's put that heat

480
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:37,199
into the house somewhere shoot it into a

481
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,639
bedroom shoot it into the bathroom if

482
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:40,240
that's what you got to do let's warm up

483
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,919
some part of the house uh maybe you're

484
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,799
growing mushrooms in another room shoot

485
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:45,519
that heat into the mushroom room or

486
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:47,919
maybe shoot that excess heat into your

487
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:50,000
veg area but let's not shoot heat out of

488
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:51,838
the house while it's [ __ ] cold in the

489
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,519
winter season another thing to keep in

490
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:56,040
mind is when are you running these

491
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:58,039
lights in the summer my flower room

492
00:16:56,039 --> 00:16:59,719
comes on at night time because I don't

493
00:16:58,039 --> 00:17:01,439
want to compete with the sunshine I know

494
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:03,199
it's easier to keep my grow room cool at

495
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,679
night because the sun's not up I don't

496
00:17:03,198 --> 00:17:06,918
need the grow lights and the sun

497
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:08,720
creating heat so when the Sun goes down

498
00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:10,679
that's when my grow room comes on in the

499
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,640
summer are you going to switch those

500
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:14,199
hours in the winter so that the lights

501
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,679
are on during the day and then you get

502
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:17,759
that cold at night so you can get it

503
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:19,559
extra cold in the grow space how are you

504
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:22,720
going to utilize the change in the

505
00:17:19,558 --> 00:17:24,038
seasons to make your grow room ideal

506
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,078
also excuse me for clearing my throat

507
00:17:24,038 --> 00:17:27,000
there not even going to edit we're going

508
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:28,798
to keep moving cuz I'm on a flow another

509
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,038
thing to think about is daylight savings

510
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:31,639
time is coming up I don't know if we're

511
00:17:30,038 --> 00:17:33,480
even still going to do that in America

512
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:35,080
is that still a thing but I know that

513
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:37,079
it's coming you spring forward and you

514
00:17:35,079 --> 00:17:39,558
fall back it is just about time to fall

515
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:41,879
back are you going to set your timers on

516
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:43,678
daylight savings time now or do you plan

517
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:46,000
to wait until daylight savings time

518
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,559
comes and then adjust your timers or are

519
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,519
you just going to forget about Daylight

520
00:17:47,558 --> 00:17:51,879
Savings Time altogether in your grow and

521
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:53,359
let it ride and just be whatever time it

522
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:55,360
is in there and let that rock that is

523
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:57,959
something to think about now because all

524
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:59,678
of these things are approaching rapidly

525
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:01,720
the season are going to change quickly

526
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:03,360

527
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,798
