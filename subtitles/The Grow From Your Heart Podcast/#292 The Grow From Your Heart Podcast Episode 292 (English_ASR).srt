36
00:01:12,688 --> 00:01:16,019
friends at the garden of Weeden and it

37
00:01:14,489 --> 00:01:17,579
is amazing you guys I'm gonna crack open

38
00:01:16,019 --> 00:01:21,149
the jar and give it a smell and try to

39
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:23,969
give you a nice description um it smells

40
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:25,710
so it's lemon og it's got a very lemon

41
00:01:23,969 --> 00:01:26,519
smell to the top of it as soon as you

42
00:01:25,709 --> 00:01:30,000
crack it open

43
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:32,250
it smells like sweet lemons sweet sour

44
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,019
tangy lemons it's got a very strong

45
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:35,700
lemon smell now often want to talk about

46
00:01:34,019 --> 00:01:38,429
lemons I talked about that dry lemon

47
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:40,859
smell like a lemon head candy or like

48
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:44,399
the country time lemonade dry powdered

49
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:46,438
smell ah this has a a wet lemon smell

50
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,000
and not in a bad way like the juicy

51
00:01:46,438 --> 00:01:49,978
lemon smell it kind of smells like a

52
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,030
Jolly Rancher like when you put a Jolly

53
00:01:49,978 --> 00:01:52,259
Rancher in your mouth and it kind of

54
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:54,629
makes you drool from that lemon flavor

55
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:57,000
it's doing that same thing to my tongue

56
00:01:54,629 --> 00:01:59,429
it's kind of giving me the lemon essence

57
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,290
Jolly Rancher candy wanted rule now I

58
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:03,118
want a Jolly Rancher candy real bad ah

59
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:05,729
that's what it's doing to me so it's got

60
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:07,579
that lemon smell to it but then once you

61
00:02:05,728 --> 00:02:09,109
get past that

62
00:02:07,579 --> 00:02:12,439
sharp punch in the face of lemons

63
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:14,150
there's this hint of like cushy gas eNOS

64
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:15,979
earthiness at the bottom of it

65
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:17,719
it just blends really well with the

66
00:02:15,979 --> 00:02:19,519
lemons the lemons kind of mute out the

67
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:21,770
gas eNOS but the gas eNOS brings out the

68
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,300
lemons I think and it is very well done

69
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:24,920
so shadows my friend Spence shadow so

70

like [ __ ] i am not a web guy it exists

89

00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:08,989
host the podcast i know it needs a lot

91
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:10,700
of updates i simply don't know how to do

92
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:12,500
it myself and if I did know how to do it

93

100
00:03:26,509 --> 00:03:29,959
statistics that I pay attention to I

101
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:31,430

102
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:33,469

103
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:35,860

104
00:03:33,469 --> 00:03:38,090
stitcher are the most used services and

105
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:40,190

106
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:42,709
when I checked my statistics on stitcher

107
00:03:40,189 --> 00:03:45,489

175
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:11,000
comedian named Elliot who I am spacing

176
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:12,350

177
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,209

179

180
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:20,478
Elliot he is a regular at Comedy Works

181
00:06:17,509 --> 00:06:22,509
is a very tall guy and he was very

182
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:25,279
hilarious if you get to see a tall guy

183
00:06:22,509 --> 00:06:26,569
named Elliot at Comedy Works he's

184

always reliably funny Elliot I've seen a

187
00:06:31,278 --> 00:06:34,759
couple of times

188
00:06:32,028 --> 00:06:37,459
always reliably funny but after Elliot

189
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:38,990
set is when the party really got started

190
00:06:37,459 --> 00:06:40,788
you guys I listen to a podcast called

191
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:42,499
the Church of what's happening now which

192
00:06:40,788 --> 00:06:44,178
is where Joey Diaz gets to do most of

193
00:06:42,499 --> 00:06:47,599
his ranting but he's joined by a

194
00:06:44,178 --> 00:06:50,838
producer named Lisa at Leal so produces

195
00:06:47,598 --> 00:06:52,908

197
00:06:52,908 --> 00:06:57,228

198
00:06:55,009 --> 00:07:00,080
called life in neutral anyway Lee has

199
00:06:57,228 --> 00:07:02,568
been a podcasting engineer and producer

200
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:04,818

201
00:07:02,569 --> 00:07:06,949

202
00:07:04,819 --> 00:07:08,838
the podcasting world and the comedy

203
00:07:06,949 --> 00:07:11,869
world because he hangs out with Steve

204
00:07:08,838 --> 00:07:14,509
Simone Joey Diaz Ari Shaffir Joe Rogan

205
00:07:11,869 --> 00:07:16,430
he's in that comedy realm so of course

206
00:07:14,509 --> 00:07:18,889
the dude has started writing and doing

207
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:20,778
comedy if you listen to his podcast that

208
00:07:18,889 --> 00:07:22,519
he's on you know that he's very new into

209
00:07:20,778 --> 00:07:24,860
comedy and he's only got about seven

210
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:26,990
minutes of time total well I happened to

211
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:29,300
be paying attention to him on Twitter

212
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:31,249
and on the podcast and they kept saying

213
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:33,050
that Lee was coming to Denver with uncle

214
00:07:31,249 --> 00:07:34,879
Joey now I didn't know if he was gonna

215
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:37,490
come to stand up or if he was just gonna

216
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:39,259
come hang out and Friday night he did

217
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:42,709
not do stand-up so I didn't expect

218
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:45,110
anything but Saturday night after the MC

219
00:07:42,709 --> 00:07:48,559
and after the opener they brought out

220
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:51,079
mr. Lisa at the Flying jus to come do a

221
00:07:48,559 --> 00:07:52,639
few minutes of comedy he did about three

222
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:54,050
to five minutes I tried not to watch the

223
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,088
clock too hard but I did try to pay

224
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:58,550
attention he did about three to five

225
00:07:56,088 --> 00:08:00,918
minutes and I could see how visibly

226
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:02,899
nervous he was but he was [ __ ]

227
00:08:00,918 --> 00:08:05,299
hilarious that dude crushed it for how

228
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:07,459
new at comedy he is and he's just a shy

229
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:10,038
nervous person in general so to see that

230
00:08:07,459 --> 00:08:12,199
dude talk about doing comedy one day on

231
00:08:10,038 --> 00:08:14,028

232
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:15,379
mic too he talked about I did three

233
00:08:14,028 --> 00:08:17,838
minutes the other night I just got to

234
00:08:15,379 --> 00:08:20,479
see this guy make the biggest level up

235
00:08:17,838 --> 00:08:22,009
in his life Lee just jumped levels Lee

236
00:08:20,478 --> 00:08:24,228
has now performed at The Comedy Store

237
00:08:22,009 --> 00:08:26,088
Lee has now performed at comedy works

238
00:08:24,228 --> 00:08:29,568
he's been on stage and crushed at the

239
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:31,939
two best clubs on the planet so shout

240
00:08:29,569 --> 00:08:34,430
out congratulations to Lisa at and also

241
00:08:31,939 --> 00:08:37,610
holy crap I was so excited to see Lee

242
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:38,870
come do comedy he crushed it he actually

243
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:40,070
pulled a move that I don't think he

244
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:42,259
realized how smooth

245
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:44,149
was one of the oh one of the acts before

246
00:08:42,259 --> 00:08:45,980
him told a joke and I'm gonna kind of

247
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:48,230
ruin the guys material but I won't ruin

248
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:49,550
it all he invented a new name for giving

249
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:51,860
a woman blue balls and he calls it

250
00:08:49,549 --> 00:08:54,439
flooding her basement all right that's

251
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:56,539
just a quick premise Lee actually came

252
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,949
out on stage and talked about himself

253
00:08:56,539 --> 00:09:00,078
for a minute and then said look at me

254
00:08:57,948 --> 00:09:02,269
I've never flooded anyone's basement and

255
00:09:00,078 --> 00:09:04,278
for a comedian to pull something back

256
00:09:02,269 --> 00:09:06,470
like that is gold so he's on the right

257
00:09:04,278 --> 00:09:08,568
path it was [ __ ] hilarious I was

258
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:09,440
super excited I did not realize that

259
00:09:08,568 --> 00:09:11,328
lee-sia

260
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,370
is about the height of a bar stool that

261
00:09:11,328 --> 00:09:16,849
dude might be four foot two or something

262
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:19,578
that is a short little man holy crap I

263
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:21,470
was amazed to see how tiny he was but

264
00:09:19,578 --> 00:09:24,919
Lee did about three or four minutes he

265
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:27,139
crushed it then he did the honors he

266
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:28,189
shifted from his material into alright

267
00:09:27,139 --> 00:09:29,690
ladies and gentlemen you know I'm from

268
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:32,540
the Church of what's happening now and

269
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:36,500
then he brought out Joey Coco Diaz who

270
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:39,439
is one of my top five maybe top three

271
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:41,899
favorite living comedians that I've ever

272
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:44,839
[ __ ] listened to Joey makes me laugh

273
00:09:41,899 --> 00:09:46,549
until weird parts of my body hurt Joey

274
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:49,160
makes me laugh until weird parts of my

275
00:09:46,549 --> 00:09:50,929
head hurt I wasn't sure what part inside

276
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:54,198
of me was giving me a sharp pain but I

277
00:09:50,929 --> 00:09:56,448
was laughing so hard that I almost

278
00:09:54,198 --> 00:09:58,099
wanted to just stop laughing for a

279
00:09:56,448 --> 00:10:00,409
minute I wanted to like oh how do I snap

280
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:02,899
out of this because it was uncomfortably

281
00:10:00,409 --> 00:10:05,240
painfully hilarious I was laughing my

282
00:10:02,899 --> 00:10:06,708
ass off I didn't have to pee but I

283
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08,870
thought I might piss my pants from

284
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:11,479
laughter it was so good so he introduces

285
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:12,948

the laughter starts to kind of you know

326
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:37,518
people laughing hahaha and then you get

327
00:11:35,059 --> 00:11:39,528
the you do that weird inhale noise

328
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,909
laughs oh like you're gonna settle down

329
00:11:39,528 --> 00:11:42,799
and you're not laughing anymore okay I'm

330
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:45,289
done huh as soon as people do that noise

331
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:46,909
he grabs the microphone stand and picks

332
00:11:45,289 --> 00:11:48,500
it up and I'm gonna do it he picks it up

333
00:11:46,909 --> 00:11:49,639
about three or four inches up off the

334
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:52,519
floor and just smacks it on the ground

335
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:54,350
and he goes ha and when he does it it's

336
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:55,759
like the [ __ ] troublemaker kid at

337
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:57,920
school just got caught doing something

338
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:59,809
but doesn't care he's like I'm gonna get

339
00:11:57,919 --> 00:12:01,909
detention whatever it was worth it cuz

340
00:11:59,809 --> 00:12:05,000
you're all laughing at me he does that

341
00:12:01,909 --> 00:12:07,578
and it's it's cheap it's a cheap-ass

342
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,769
comedy move but it's genuine it's if it

343
00:12:07,578 --> 00:12:11,778
were disingenuous I would call him on it

344
00:12:09,769 --> 00:12:13,339
it is just Joey's way of going ha look

345
00:12:11,778 --> 00:12:15,740
you bad [ __ ] we're friends and

346
00:12:13,339 --> 00:12:16,670
we're laughing together it is so [ __ ]

347
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:18,620
funny when he does it

348
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:20,509
so he'll hit you he'll tag you again

349
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:21,799
he'll tag you again and when you finally

350
00:12:20,509 --> 00:12:22,519
think you're coming out of that water

351
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:24,198
and getting there

352
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:26,419
he'll slam that microphone stand on the

353
00:12:24,198 --> 00:12:28,729
ground go ha ha and then you're busted

354
00:12:26,419 --> 00:12:32,870
again I [ __ ] laughed so hard at uncle

355
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:35,180
Joey Joey told Joey tells some filthy

356
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:37,818
jokes maybe that's why I like him Joey

357
00:12:35,179 --> 00:12:39,289
has a dirty mouth and a dirty mind but

358
00:12:37,818 --> 00:12:39,740
he's honest and that's part of what I

359
00:12:39,289 --> 00:12:42,679
love

360
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:45,198
but anyway Joey told a nice long story

361
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:47,239
that was tremendous and people were

362
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:48,799
offended and people were disgustingly

363
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:50,720
laughing or like I can't believe he just

364
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:52,278
said that [ __ ] in front of 250 people

365
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,560
uncle Joey that [ __ ] you might want to

366
00:12:52,278 --> 00:12:56,179
keep private and everybody's laughing

367
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:57,649
and he's making this face that he makes

368
00:12:56,179 --> 00:12:59,899
he opens his mouth and shakes his head

369
00:12:57,649 --> 00:13:01,429
so that his bottom jaw flops back and

370
00:12:59,899 --> 00:13:02,899
forth and he looks at you like ah it's

371
00:13:01,429 --> 00:13:04,818
funny and it's really really is funny

372
00:13:02,899 --> 00:13:05,870
but then he goes it's Saturday night you

373
00:13:04,818 --> 00:13:06,698
[ __ ] you want to hear

374
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:09,289
knock-knock joke

375
00:13:06,698 --> 00:13:11,149
for that man to realize that we were at

376
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:13,639
our limit and then just try to push us a

377
00:13:11,149 --> 00:13:15,078
little more as just so it's so amazing

378
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:16,818
the way he works a crowd Joey brings

379
00:13:15,078 --> 00:13:19,878
energy that nobody else [ __ ] brings

380
00:13:16,818 --> 00:13:22,188
so I get to see Joey again unfortunately

381
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:25,188
there was another show afterward so we

382
00:13:22,188 --> 00:13:27,618
didn't have the regular outside smoke

383
00:13:25,188 --> 00:13:29,389
sesh that we usually have things had to

384
00:13:27,619 --> 00:13:31,999
be a little more contained so it wasn't

385
00:13:29,389 --> 00:13:34,428
a big party like normal however I did

386
00:13:31,999 --> 00:13:36,050
have a very good time shout out to all

387
00:13:34,428 --> 00:13:37,068
my friends at Comedy Works to take very

388
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:38,868
good care of me

389
00:13:37,068 --> 00:13:40,789
you guys I keep saying it and they don't

390
00:13:38,869 --> 00:13:42,589

391
00:13:40,789 --> 00:13:44,419
of my Comedy Works tickets I pay for all

392
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:45,980
my food there they don't sponsor me in

393
00:13:44,419 --> 00:13:48,110
any way I just [ __ ] love it

394
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:50,869
I recommend that everybody wherever you

395

396

399
00:13:56,539 --> 00:14:00,139
a while alright you guys I feel like

400
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:01,490
that's enough bragging about my weekend

401
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:03,379
enough talking about comedy let's

402
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:06,709
actually read an email that has

403
00:14:03,379 --> 00:14:08,928
something to do with some cannabis all

404
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:11,028
right podcast world this email comes

405
00:14:08,928 --> 00:14:12,769
from our friend Ben Osborne and it goes

406
00:14:11,028 --> 00:14:14,629
like this he starts off right away and

407
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:16,188
says feel free to use my name and the

408
00:14:14,629 --> 00:14:18,289
name of the company that I work for if

409
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:20,230

410
00:14:18,289 --> 00:14:22,338
thank you that makes life so easy ah

411
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:23,928
this one's from Ben it goes like this

412
00:14:22,339 --> 00:14:25,730
dear Rasta Jeff let me start by thanking

413
00:14:23,928 --> 00:14:26,448
you for everything you don't know you've

414
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:28,370
done for me

415
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:29,990
almost two years ago I decided to get

416
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:31,909
into the cannabis industry as a grower

417
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:33,620
I've had terrible luck growing anything

418
00:14:31,909 --> 00:14:36,620
throughout my life killing just about

419
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:38,149
everything I touched I felt that with

420
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:40,068
proper knowledge and enough effort that

421
00:14:38,149 --> 00:14:42,350
I would be able to be successful in my

422
00:14:40,068 --> 00:14:44,269
grow my love for cannabis is a very

423
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:45,709
strong driving force I think you know

424
00:14:44,269 --> 00:14:47,899
the feeling yes sir I certainly do know

425
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:50,149
that feeling he said after all it saved

426
00:14:47,899 --> 00:14:52,809
my life I was hired at the clinic about

427
00:14:50,149 --> 00:14:54,909
a year and a half ago as a tremor

428
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:56,469
as of about three months ago partially

429
00:14:54,909 --> 00:14:58,299

00:16:16,389 --> 00:16:20,919
ties between cannabis strains it holds a

472
00:16:19,149 --> 00:16:23,199
lot of information aside from genetic

473
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:27,069
ties such as breeder name and novelty

474
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:30,100

492
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:08,620
hotmail.com send me an email maybe

493
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:11,048
I will read your message on a future

494
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:13,719
episode now let's talk about the Philo's

495
00:17:11,048 --> 00:17:16,240
galaxy yes I am very aware of the

496
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:20,289
Philo's galaxy because my grateful dog

497
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:21,818
is actually part of their website Colin

498
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:24,338
Gordon from the ethos collective was

499
00:17:21,818 --> 00:17:27,039
kind enough to get my sample of grateful

500
00:17:24,338 --> 00:17:29,200
dog into their database so I read

501
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:32,798
genetics is actually included in the

502
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:35,080
Philo's bio science galaxy I really like

503
00:17:32,798 --> 00:17:36,759
the website I think it is great one of

504
00:17:35,079 --> 00:17:40,269
my favorite parts about the website is

505
00:17:36,759 --> 00:17:43,509
an algorithm where you can put in a

506
00:17:40,269 --> 00:17:46,480
strain and it can show you strains that

507
00:17:43,509 --> 00:17:50,079
it has not been bred to and strains that

508
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:53,019
it is genetically very far from it would

509
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:55,240
be good breeding ideas this website

510
00:17:53,019 --> 00:17:57,490
knows what genetics are making up each

511
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:59,798
strain and it can tell you so it

512
00:17:57,490 --> 00:18:02,079
recommended to me that I breed Girl

513
00:17:59,798 --> 00:18:03,730
Scout cookies the forum cut to my

514
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:05,558
grateful dog because they were so

515
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:07,630
genetically far apart they did not have

516
00:18:05,558 --> 00:18:09,910
any similar parents that it would make a

517
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:12,220
very unique cross so it recommended that

518
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:15,100
to me on the website which I found to be

519
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:17,558
very amazing because I had already made

520
00:18:15,099 --> 00:18:19,539
that cross and it was [ __ ] tremendous

521
00:18:17,558 --> 00:18:21,460
and I call it Burning Spear and it

522
00:18:19,539 --> 00:18:25,298
already been done so I guess I need to

523
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:26,798
send a Burning Spear clone to Philo's so

524
00:18:25,298 --> 00:18:28,720
that they can get it in their galaxy and

525
00:18:26,798 --> 00:18:29,798
show that it's been made so that's one

526
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,259
of the great things that the Philo's

527
00:18:29,798 --> 00:18:34,839
galaxy does I kind of think of it as

528
00:18:32,259 --> 00:18:37,029
like an ancestry.com for cannabis it's

529
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:38,769
kind of like a a family tree for the

530
00:18:37,029 --> 00:18:41,079
cannabis plant and I really like it it's

531
00:18:38,769 --> 00:18:43,058
a really great website it's really fun

532
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:44,558
if even if you guys aren't breeders if

533
00:18:43,058 --> 00:18:46,450
you were just interested in cannabis

534
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:48,039
cannabis genetics and you want to nerd

535
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:50,019
out a little bit on cannabis I

536
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:54,099
definitely recommend you go check out

537
00:18:50,019 --> 00:18:55,569
Philo's bioscience just poke around once

538
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:57,990
you get into the galaxy you'll start

539
00:18:55,569 --> 00:19:00,369
clicking and you will be there all day

540
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:02,470
so Ben thanks for the great email thanks

542
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:07,539

very interesting and once you start

545
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:12,970
looking you'll start seeing all the

546
00:19:11,558 --> 00:19:14,289
strains you're familiar with and then

547
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:15,400
you'll see what they're crossed with and

548
00:19:14,289 --> 00:19:17,829
then you'll want to know what those were

549
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:20,259
crossed with and you'll be there all day

funding keeping all these microphone

580
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:28,480
covers fresh takes a little bit

581
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:30,460
sometimes equipment takes a [ __ ] on me

582
