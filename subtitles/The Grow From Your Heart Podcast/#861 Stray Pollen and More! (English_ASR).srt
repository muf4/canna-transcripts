all of that patreon support ladies and

35
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,799
gentlemen in the last episode in the

36
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,920
last two episodes we have been talking

37
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:50,000
about growroom improvements and things

38
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,840
we can add to our growroom that weren't

39
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,920
necessarily designed for growroom

40
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,520
purposes there were a lot of great I had

41
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,280
a lot of great ideas and then the

42
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:59,319
audience did contribute a lot of great

43
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,039
submissions a lot of great ideas I have

44
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:02,559
another sub Mission here of something we

45
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:04,280
overlooked something we should have

46
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,560
thought of as we were working on our

47
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:08,598
grow room supplies list this is a very

48
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,120
useful idea very good suggestion

49
00:02:08,598 --> 00:02:14,959
somebody said that we can use a gallon

50
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,599
Ziploc bag over a uh clone and a cup as

51
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,640
a clone Dome so if you want to take one

52
00:02:16,598 --> 00:02:20,878
clone you can fill that clone that beer

53
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:22,719
cup up with uh dirt you can moisten that

54
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:24,799
dirt cut your clone dip it in rooting

55
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:27,199
gel put it into that dirt and then use a

56
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,920
baggie a gallon baggie over that as your

57
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:30,399
clone Dome that will work very well that

58
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:32,119
is a very good idea

59
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,360
I can't believe I did not think of that

60
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:36,680
also I've seen people use a lot of those

61
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:38,959
boxes from The Container Store as their

62
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:41,599
own clone uh device their own clone

63
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:43,680
environment so you can get a plastic bin

64
00:02:41,598 --> 00:02:45,280
from The Container Store flip it upside

65
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,080
down put the Clone plugs on the bottom

66
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,039
part there uh do all your work and then

67
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,920
just put that bin right on top of that

68
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:53,000
that works as your clone environment

69
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:55,238
can't believe I did not think of that so

70
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,680
great update there use a Ziploc baggie

71
00:02:55,239 --> 00:02:59,439
over a Solo Cup when sprouting clones

72
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,879
and this person said seeds I don't

73
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:02,560
recommend putting anything over the

74
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:03,959
seedling I like to leave them exposed

75
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,680
because it does make a weak seedling if

76
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:08,439
you put a dome over that but for a clone

77
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:10,000
that is a wonderful idea ladies and

78
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:12,318
gentlemen if you have more ideas on how

79
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,719
to uh improve our grow room our growroom

80
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:16,878
experience with products we can buy not

81
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:18,560
necessarily from the grow store because

82
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:20,840
all those prices all those products are

83
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,680
overpriced uh send me some ideas let me

84
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,319
know uh put it in either you can put it

85
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,519
in this episode in the comments or the

86
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:28,318
two previous episodes and my favorite

87
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:30,400
comment from each episode will win a

88
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:33,119
coupon code for a free pack of seeds at

89
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,640
idirect decom uh keep in mind I have not

90
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,799
given a deadline for those once the

91
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:39,119
comments get stale uh then I will choose

92
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:41,799
my favorite and we will give some free

93
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,120
packs of seeds all right let's stay on

94
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:44,879
track here I do have a bunch of great

95
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,438
questions here in front of me I do have

96
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:49,518
a website that main website is iry

97
00:03:47,438 --> 00:03:50,878
genetics.com that's where almost

98
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,239
everything is hosted there's a link to

99
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:55,359
the Discord server uh the patreon link

100
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:57,680
is there and there is a link on the top

101
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,120
that says grow help or grow questions if

102
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,000
you click on that tab it's over to the

103
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,079
right is why point this way every time

104
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,799
it's over to that part of the screen if

105
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:06,879
you click on that tab it does give you

106
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:09,280
the opportunity to send me a grow

107
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:10,840
question if you send me a good grow

108
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,120
question and I read that question here

109
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:15,759
on the podcast I will send you a coupon

110
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:18,319
code for a free pack of seeds at I

111
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:20,599
direct.com today's question came from

112
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:22,800
somebody that is called Hobbit from the

113
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,680
family Shire shout out to my new friend

114
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,840
the other Hobbit from the family Shire

115
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:28,120
we've already got another friend named

116
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:29,519
Hobbit shout out to that dude as well uh

117
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,160
family Shire Hobbit make sure you check

118
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:34,198
your inbox because you've got a coupon

119
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:36,560
code for a free pack of seeds at idirect

120
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:38,199
decom this is a really good question

121
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,199
I've uh I talk about this I've addressed

122
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:42,639
this a lot it is a very good time to

123
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:45,360
address this on the podcast once again

124
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:47,720
it says if I had a grow we're off to a

125
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,000
good start and one plant got stressed

126
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:52,400
and made male flowers so your female

127
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,959
plant got stressed and produced male

128
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:56,560
flowers that is now an interex plant it

129
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:58,359
is not a male it's not a female that

130
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,560
plant showed you both sexes it is now

131
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:03,160
determined to be an interex plant it has

132
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,560
proven that to us now it says um perhaps

133
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:08,240
this uh interex plant pollinated some of

134
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:10,959
the other plants that's very likely that

135
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:14,079
does happen it says will the seeds be

136
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:16,038
female and will they produce Herms it's

137
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:18,560
really hard to predict what may happen

138
00:05:16,038 --> 00:05:20,759
you do not have feminized seeds you did

139
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,120
not do anything to those seeds to make

140
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:25,439
them feminized so they are not all going

141
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,680
to be female uh there's no guarantee

142
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:29,399
they will all be female uh you're likely

143
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,759
to get female seeds out of there you're

144
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:33,839
also likely to get intersect seeds out

145
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,439
of there to expect these seeds to be all

146
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:37,679
female or feminized you would have had

147
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:40,079
to have done something to them to be

148
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,319
feminized um the plant that the pollen

149
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:44,839
came from was not a true female that

150
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:47,280
plant was interex you have now

151
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:49,159
technically bred with an interex plant

152
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:50,758
to another female plant which possibly

153
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,759
could be interex as well that's a whole

154
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:54,800
another conversation uh maybe that one

155
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:56,919
hasn't expressed its interex traits yet

156
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,120
but we know one plant was an interex

157
00:05:56,918 --> 00:06:01,680
plant so it doesn't have two x's it has

158
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,918
an X and a y floating around somewhere

159
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,840
giving it that interx expression the

160
00:06:03,918 --> 00:06:08,598
other plant possibly could be a female

161
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:11,239
it received pollen now we've got female

162
00:06:08,598 --> 00:06:13,079
and interex genes in there and that's

163
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,960
all in our plant mix we could get more

164
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:16,318
females we could get more intersex

165
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:18,638
plants you could possibly even pull a

166
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,759
male out of this we don't know what that

167
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,280
uh plant that uh showed its interx

168
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:24,520
expression we don't know what it passed

169
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:26,159
on we don't know what it did to the mix

170
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:28,879
so to think that they would all be

171
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:31,000
feminized would not be accurate thinking

172
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:32,839
uh you're likely to get females but pay

173
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,918
very close attention to them all the way

174
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:36,560
through the flowering phase because at

175
00:06:34,918 --> 00:06:38,639
any time they could show you that

176
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,038
they've got that intersec trait it could

177
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:43,160
be week one it could be week nine uh you

178
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:45,079
never know but they could be intersect

179
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,599
so keep an eye on that so the first part

180
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:48,800
of the question was will they all be

181
00:06:46,598 --> 00:06:50,719
females that part is unlikely nothing

182
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,160
was done to feminize the seeds when I

183
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,520
make feminized seeds there's a process I

184
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:57,879
am doing something very specifically to

185
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:59,918
make those seeds be female I am

186
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:02,000
feminizing them making feminize seeds

187
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:04,240
this was nothing was done here for the

188
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,360
feminization of these seeds the next

189
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,720
part of the question is will they

190
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,400
produce Herms uh that is quite possible

191
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:12,000
because they've got Herm traits in them

192
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:13,399
um if you think about breeding if you

193
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,319
think about genetics if you take a

194
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:16,959
person with blue eyes and a person with

195
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:18,199
blonde hair and a person with brown eyes

196
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:20,079
and brown hair and you breed them

197
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:21,840
together that blue eyes and blonde hair

198
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:24,000
will pop up in The Offspring The Blue

199
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:26,719
Eyes the whatever the [ __ ] I said in the

200
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,879
mixes you will see those combos pop up

201
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,000
within the offspring that Herm trait

202
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:33,240
that you bred with with is a possibility

203
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,720
that will pop up in The Offspring just

204
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,360
like any other breeding trait I think

205
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,280
intersect is a trait that could be

206
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:40,840
passed down so the main questions was

207
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:42,598
will they be females uh some will

208
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:44,758
possibly interx who knows what else you

209
00:07:42,598 --> 00:07:47,199
got will they produce Herms quite

210
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:49,080
possibly yes also keep this in mind I

211
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,598
would grow some of these uh you grow

212
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:51,918
them don't share them don't pass them

213
00:07:50,598 --> 00:07:54,158
out don't give them to any friends

214
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:56,000
definitely don't sell them but you grow

215
00:07:54,158 --> 00:07:57,959
them and see what you've created maybe

216
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,120
just maybe you've got some new amazing

217
00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:02,680
hot fire maybe you've created some

218
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:05,079
amazing [ __ ] on accident all of the chem

219
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:07,000
dog stuff came from bag seed which means

220
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:08,959
somebody bought weed that had seeds in

221
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,720
it and they grew those seeds and found

222
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:13,000
amazing fire that's essentially what

223
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,919
you've got is bag seed in the long run

224
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,439
you're going to have buds with seeds in

225
00:08:14,918 --> 00:08:17,758
it you're going to pull those seeds out

226
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:20,158
you're going to grow them and you may

227
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:22,240
find that you've got some amazing [ __ ]

228
00:08:20,158 --> 00:08:24,719
also you could find you've got a whole

229
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,680
bunch of trashy mutant intersex plants

230
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,639
so the only way to find out is to grow

231
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:30,199
them uh grow them yourself like I said

232
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,639
don't share them don't trade them don't

233
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:34,560
give them away don't uh dilute and

234
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:35,958
pollute the genan pool with them until

235
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,158
you've grown them tested them and

236
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:40,038
verified them yourself and had fun with

237
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:41,679
them uh I just said have fun with them

238
00:08:40,038 --> 00:08:43,439
that of course is the most important

239
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,838
part have fun as long as you're being

240
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,320
ethical you're not lying to anybody

241
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:48,200
you're not messing up anybody's Garden

242
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,760
you're not stealing money from anybody

243
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,600
have a good time in the garden do what

244
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:53,720
makes you happy uh grow from your heart

245
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,159
breed with love and enjoy the experience

246
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,480
don't make it stressful and uh yeah have

247
00:08:56,159 --> 00:09:00,078
fun that's the most important part if

248
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:01,399
it's not fun then what is it all right

249
00:09:00,078 --> 00:09:04,479
that was a really good question got me

250
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:06,039
rambling quite well uh my dude Hobbit

favorite website edirect Doom let's jump

267
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:42,600
into the question it says hey I love the

268
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:46,440
show hey thank you for listening it goes

269
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:48,360
on it says I need more help I like that

270
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:50,240
I'm here for you it says what was the

271
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:52,560
latest in flower you have had a

272
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,839
successful reversal so they're talking

273
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:57,639
about reversing a female a female plant

274
00:09:54,839 --> 00:10:00,120
to uh create anthers to use that pollen

275
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:02,399
to create feminized seeds

276
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:04,039
um how what is the latest into flow

277
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,879
you've had successful is two weeks into

278
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:10,278
flow two fing late yeah bro you are way

279
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:12,919
too effing late um I had a weather issue

280
00:10:10,278 --> 00:10:14,399
had to go shut down um and I put

281
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:17,679
everything into flower and now I have a

282
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:20,159
banger of a plant um yeah bro you're too

283
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:22,078
late when it comes to reversing um I

284
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:24,078
recommend starting a week before the

285
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:26,799
flowering phase with your sprays or

286
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:28,519
starting the day of flour if not that

287
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:30,000
plant will be so far into flow you won't

288
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:32,000
be able to reverse the hormones before

289
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,440
it's just done then it won't create any

290
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,360
anthers then you won't get any pollen um

291
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:38,519
also if your females are two weeks into

292
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:40,680
flour like the plants that will receive

293
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:42,480
the pollen you're way [ __ ] out of luck

294
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:44,519
bro cuz that then they're going to be

295
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,720
way too far done by the time your pollen

296
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:48,480
donor creates pollen they'll be dried up

297
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,879
all the pistols will be done uh they

298
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,200
will not be able to receive pollen they

299
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:53,360
will not create any seeds for you so I

300
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,320
hate to say it but it sounds like you

301
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,440
might be [ __ ] out of luck for reversing

302
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,720
this plant there may be ways to do it

303
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,680
there are new products out there I

304
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,879
wouldn't do it with silver tho sulfate

305
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:04,599
it will not work on time what I would

306
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:06,879
probably do is I would get a clone of

307
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:09,839
this even if it's in flour uh take a

308
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:11,360
couple of clones and rev that clone you

309
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,959
can put it in a clone Dome you can put

310
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,800
it in an easy cloner I'd probably do the

311
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:16,638
easy cloner uh put a little bit of

312
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:19,359
nitrogen feed in there along with the

313
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:20,879
yellow clonex uh the juice that clonex

314
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,720
sells you the yellow stuff dip it in the

315
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:26,439
purple fill the clone machine with the

316
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:28,040
yellow stuff an EC of 1.0 and a pH of

317
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,720
like you could do 62 is probably where

318
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:30,838
I'd recommend right now do 2 I'm not

319
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,800
looking in my notes so I don't remember

320
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:35,720
the exact what I would say but 62 would

321
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:38,399
be a good uh pH for that so you're 1.0

322
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:39,720
EC 62 then add a little bit of Base

323
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:41,600
nutrients in there just to give you that

324
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:44,360
nitrogen just to speed up that reveg

325
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,600
process then put that bad [ __ ] under 24

326
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:48,800
hours of light if you can maybe 18 hours

327
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:50,959
if that's all you could do but rev that

328
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:52,479
bad [ __ ] put some clones under light

329
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:54,518
and rev them then you can get that

330
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:57,000
genetic that cultivar back you won't

331
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:59,078
lose it or simply finish out the Harvest

332
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,639
and rev the plant that you are growing

333
00:11:59,078 --> 00:12:02,679
now now I don't know what the best

334
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,320
option is for you but you can definitely

335
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:05,958
however far into flower you are with a

336
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,760
plant you can cut a clone and you can

337
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:09,879
rev that bad [ __ ] and you can save

338
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:11,480
those genetics or you can let it finish

339
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:13,278
and then you can rev it we'll do a quick

340
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:15,920
rev chat right now not going to go too

341
00:12:13,278 --> 00:12:17,278
far Harvest time comes right cut off all

342
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:19,000
the top parts of the plants at the

343
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:20,480
bottom here you got a couple of buds the

344
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,440
size of my thumb you got a branch coming

345
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:25,240
up a branch coming up leave some buds

346
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:28,839
like about the size of my thumb leave

347
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:30,959
leaves on that bud uh leave leaves on

348
00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:32,560
the bu I mean to say that word twice you

349
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:34,399
want foliage on there because that's

350
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:35,838
what is going to receive the light

351
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:37,958
that's where the hormones will develop

352
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:40,440
that is what is going to make that bud

353
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:42,000
rev itself so leave some foliage on a

354
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:44,160
bud you got two or three three or five

355
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,360
little bottom buds on a plant leave some

356
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:48,399
leaves on there let the [ __ ] light

357
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:51,039
get to those leaves give them 18 hours

358
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:53,320
24 hours if you can uh if that plant is

359
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:55,799
root bound put it into a bigger pot

360
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:57,800
it'll happily uh speed up your process

361
00:12:55,799 --> 00:13:00,198
if you put that root bound pot plant

362
00:12:57,799 --> 00:13:02,120
into a larger pot let the root spread uh

363
00:13:00,198 --> 00:13:03,799
some plants will just flower simply

364
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:05,639
because they are too tightly root bound

365
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:08,120
so give it some legs give it some room

366
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:10,600
to spread uh have just a few bottoms

367
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:12,720
there then put it under the 186 or 24

368
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,959
hours of light then you'll see in about

369
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,639
it'll take a while it's going to take

370
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:17,119
you two three maybe four weeks you'll

371
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:18,919
start getting new growth coming out of

372
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,120
the top of that bud stuff will just

373
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:21,679
start coming out of the top of there

374
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:23,360
it's going to look wonky and twisted and

375
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:25,599
Whirled and it's going to look like it's

376
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,039
really sad but it's going to work out of

377
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,639
that just give it some time it'll keep

378
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:30,838
growing it'll grow it'll work itself out

379
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,680
of that weird Twisted [ __ ] and then one

380
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:34,720
day it'll just spit out a perfect little

381
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:36,198
Shute that looks like a little clone let

382
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,519
that grow let that happen till you got

383
00:13:36,198 --> 00:13:39,519
two or three of those so you can [ __ ]

384
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:41,519
around and find out then take one of

385
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:43,360
those clones two of those little shoots

386
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,879
that it's spitting and clone those I

387
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,320
know that sounds wild but put that in a

388
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:49,720
cloner and get those to root now use

389
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:51,278
those new shoots that you've just cloned

390
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:53,360
as your new mother plants that's your

391
00:13:51,278 --> 00:13:55,078
new mother plant let that grow out now

392
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,959
you've got that cultivar secured you can

393
00:13:55,078 --> 00:14:00,599
cut clones from there uh feed that plant

394
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:03,359
a basic veg like you would your mom's

395
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:05,519
maybe boost up the nitrogen a little bit

396
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,240
um and that's the quick version of rev I

397
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,879
hope I covered all that because that was

398
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,120
spontaneous I did not have any notes

399
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:12,679
there I just decided that I would tell

400
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:14,000
you that now uh rev is pretty easy you

401
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:15,719
just got to be patient that's really all

402
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,839
it takes lights and patient give it

403
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:19,879
plenty of light uh give it a bigger pot

404
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:22,480
and give it some patience and it will it

405
00:14:19,879 --> 00:14:23,759
will reveg on you so I think you're too

406
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,759
late with your reversal to be honest

407
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:27,320
with you I hate to bust your bubble but

408
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:28,560
I did give you some backup plans a

409
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:31,079
couple of different options cut some

410
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:33,599
clones uh get those clones reved or

411
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:35,719
simply rev that big old Mama plant that

412
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,879
you're working with or suck it up

413
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,839
because you got a free pack of seeds

414
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:40,600
coming from edirect decom and you can

415
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:42,279
just grow those my dude uh make sure you

416
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:45,199
check the spam folder and once again

417
00:14:42,278 --> 00:14:46,879
thank you for the great question all

418
00:14:45,198 --> 00:14:48,319
right I've got some good momentum here

419
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:49,838
let's keep rolling I've got another

420
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,079
question here in front of me I've got a

421
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,759
couple of questions this one is the one

422
00:14:52,078 --> 00:14:55,638
that I wanted to get to all right this

423
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:57,360
one's been cooking for a little while

424
00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:59,799
this one came from somebody who wants to

425
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,560
be called ham biscuit ladies and

426
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:02,919
gentlemen big shout out to my friend ham

427
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:05,359
biscuit if you want your question right

428
00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:08,278
here on the podcast uh go to the iy

429
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,639
genetics website iy genetics.com on the

430
00:15:08,278 --> 00:15:11,519
top of that website there's a row of

431
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:13,120
tabs one does say grow help click on

432
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:15,240
that grow help tab send me your question

433
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,480
if I read your question guess what free

434
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:20,000
seeds ham biscuits question goes like

435
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:22,800
this it says from the time a seed breaks

436
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,159
the dirt when do you start to feed that

437
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:27,679
is a really good question um when I see

438
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:29,719
my friend this um Let me give a

439
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:32,758
disclaimer if you you put your plant

440
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:34,759
into soil that's got um High nitrogen or

441
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:36,959
a lot of nutrients in that soil like

442
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:38,759
some amended soil or a store-bought

443
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:41,439
soilless mix that's got that brags about

444
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:42,879
having its listed to have an NPK value

445
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,360
sometimes those plants can go for a

446
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:47,120
little while without being fed that is

447
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,600
up to you if you want to Turbo feed that

448
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,639
plant if you want to let that plant live

449
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:52,680
off of what's in that soil some of those

450
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:55,879
soilless mixes claim to be good for 2 to

451
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:57,359
four weeks some say 6 weeks um I don't

452
00:15:55,879 --> 00:15:59,439
ever let them go that long without

453
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,159
feeding in that soiless mix but but

454
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,519
before we go too far keep in mind that

455
00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:06,000
some of your soil soilless mixes will be

456
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:08,120
preed and that's got to come into play

457
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,360
you've got to adjust that to my response

458
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:12,318
here but usually within the first two to

459
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:15,079
three weeks when I see the first true

460
00:16:12,318 --> 00:16:16,719
leaves pop up um then I pay attention

461
00:16:15,078 --> 00:16:19,159
then I'll probably feed right when I see

462
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,120
those first leaves spread out sometimes

463
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:23,120
I'll wait for the second set if it's in

464
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,639
like a hot soil then I'll just pay

465
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,679
attention to the plant the first sign of

466
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:29,079
yellowing then it will get fed but it's

467
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:31,958
usually the first two or three weeks uh

468
00:16:29,078 --> 00:16:33,399
all mix up a nitrogen a basic base feed

469
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:35,359
sometimes I'll feed it a bean sauce give

470
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:37,039
it a little bit of microbes a little bit

471
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,440
of phosphorus a little bit of potassium

472
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:40,838
just to get that little tiny plant

473
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:42,560
growing a little bit more quickly uh but

474
00:16:40,839 --> 00:16:44,199
that's all just uh that's Advanced

475
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:46,318
growing stuff if you're asking this wait

476
00:16:44,198 --> 00:16:48,838
two to three weeks depending on the soil

477
00:16:46,318 --> 00:16:50,318
or soiless mix what you are playing with

478
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:52,880
then we got a follow-up question do you

479
00:16:50,318 --> 00:16:55,519
plant directly into your soil or medium

480
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:57,879
no I do a uh paper towel germination

481
00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:00,519
sort of thing um sometimes I float the

482
00:16:57,879 --> 00:17:03,039
seeds in water for 12 to 24 hours before

483
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:05,759
most of the time I do not do that um I

484
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:07,879
fold up a paper towel into a square and

485
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:09,480
I soak it with water and I put it on a

486
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:11,959
plate and I tip it to where the excess

487
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:14,078
water runs off unfold it put some seeds

488
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:16,400
in there fold it back up and then I put

489
00:17:14,078 --> 00:17:19,359
that in a warm dry dark place and

490
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:21,640
usually within 24 hours my seeds sprout

491
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:23,879
then I put them in a usually a beer cup

492
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:25,520
honestly I use a Solo Cup uh just like a

493
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:28,000
party cup that you use to play flippy

494
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:29,599
cup or beer pong um shout out to all the

495
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,599
flippy cup gang you know who I'm talking

496
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:34,159
about um I fill that cup with soil

497
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:36,279
soilless mix Pat it down then I water it

498
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,640
before I even put my seedling into there

499
00:17:36,279 --> 00:17:39,599
water it then I put just a little

500
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:41,640
indention all just just about a knuckle

501
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:43,319
deep is all I really go Bo just a little

502
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:45,080
press put my seiling in there and then

503
00:17:43,319 --> 00:17:46,879
just gently press dirt right on top of

504
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:48,439
it and then just press that under or put

505
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:51,960
that under the light usually under a

506
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:54,080
small LED or a T5 uh give it 186 maybe

507
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:56,480
24 hours of light usually 186 for the

508
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:58,240
seedlings uh but that's uh the quickest

509
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,360
germination into a cut method I can

510
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,880
teach you right there there let me stay

511
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:02,959
focused you didn't even ask about that

512
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,840
part the question does go on it says the

513
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,798
reason I ask is because I have used

514
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:09,079
several methods successfully but I do

515
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:11,480
get more helmet heads with the paper

516
00:18:09,079 --> 00:18:13,480
towel method I flipped my Golden Goat to

517
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:15,679
1212 this past Sunday and it's looking

518
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:17,279
super happy uh bro congrats on Flipping

519
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,440
The Golden Goat I hope to see those

520
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:21,359
photos um so he's talking about helmet

521
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,038
head let me describe what helmet head

522
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:25,959
even is here uh on the podcast before we

523
00:18:24,038 --> 00:18:27,759
talk too much about it helmet head let's

524
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:29,600
talk about helmet head a little bit here

525
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:31,359
a lot of times when you plant a seed it

526
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:33,599
will pop up through the soil or the soil

527
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:35,399
is mix when it pops up a lot of times it

528
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:36,959
should have two little miniature leaves

529
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:39,200
that want to spread open and get life

530
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:41,000
started a lot of times the seed will get

531
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,279
stuck on one of those little parts and

532
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,839
it will not spread properly and a lot of

533
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:47,798
people really freak out they have a lot

534
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:50,319
of panic attack about that um there is a

535
00:18:47,798 --> 00:18:51,639
little bit of debate on what causes that

536
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:53,678
some people will tell you that you're

537
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:55,240
planting the seed too deep and some

538
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:58,080
people will tell you you're not planting

539
00:18:55,240 --> 00:19:00,240
the seed deep enough so there's a couple

540
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:02,279
of uh School of thought I want you guys

541
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,480
in the comment section please leave me

542
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:06,960
your opinion uh your bro science your

543
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:09,240
real science your edicated uh factual

544
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,120
input on why we're getting helmet head

545
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:13,599
when we plant our seeds what is the main

546
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:15,038
cause of that how can we prevent it um

547
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:16,319
some people will tell you it's too deep

548
00:19:15,038 --> 00:19:19,319
some people will tell you it's too

549
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:20,678
shallow I am not certain uh I'm going to

550
00:19:19,319 --> 00:19:22,879
leave it up to the comment section what

551
00:19:20,679 --> 00:19:25,240
I can tell you is it's real easy to

552
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:27,240
remove it is very simple to remove that

553
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:28,400
helmet head um I've seen a couple of

554
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,798
different methods somebody told me a

555
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,280
real fun method of it the other day

556
00:19:29,798 --> 00:19:33,038
which we'll talk about so what I like to

557
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:34,678
do I get a spray bottle with just plain

558
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:37,440
water in it and I will get real close

559
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:39,080
and just spray that ceiling just just

560
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,640
spray it real good kind of aggressively

561
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:43,599
to be honest put some Mist into it then

562
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:45,640
what I'm trying to do is moisten that

563
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:47,639
helmet head to soften the helmet and

564
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:49,840
also add some lubrication between that

565
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:51,799
leaf and the seed shell so that I can

566
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:53,240
get some tweezers and just lightly pluck

567
00:19:51,798 --> 00:19:54,759
that helmet head right off of there

568
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:56,240
don't pull hard enough to where you're

569
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:57,319
lifting up the seed and yanking it all

570
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,599
the way out of the dirt you don't want

571
00:19:57,319 --> 00:20:01,240
to do that gently remove it just

572
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:03,279
scientifically surgically get in there

573
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:05,319
just real gently spray it with water and

574
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:07,319
pull it off of there another method that

575
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:08,839
a friend recently told me that they do

576
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:11,079
they spray it with water but then they

577
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:13,038
do the backwards version of what I do

578
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:15,000
they take the tweezers and put it inside

579
00:20:13,038 --> 00:20:16,480
the seed shell and let the tweezers open

580
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,240
on their own because the tweezers will

581
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,360
automatically pop open once their

582
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,960
default is open and they will pop that

583
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:24,000
seed shell open far enough and then the

584
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:25,400
seed shell will just fall off so that's

585
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,038
a couple of different ways to deal with

586
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:29,759
helmet head but what I want is comments

587
00:20:28,038 --> 00:20:32,279
you guys please let me know what is

588
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:35,240
