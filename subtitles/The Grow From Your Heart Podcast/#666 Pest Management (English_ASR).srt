70
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,080

i replied with there is so much to cover

78
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:57,360

going to get into details on uh each

80
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,480
specific pest we're going to talk about

81
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:04,959
basic integrated pest management let's

82
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:07,439

83
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,878
to making sure we don't get a we're

84
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:10,959
going to get let me start by saying this

85
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:13,840
you're going to experience bugs in your

86
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,920
garden [ __ ] does happen we can't stop

87
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,319
everything uh sometimes the best way to

88
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:19,598
learn how to prevent a pest is to get a

89
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:22,318
pest the best way to learn how to

90
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:24,399
eradicate a pest is to get that pest you

91
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:26,560
never learn about a problem until you

92
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,158
have to face it so you're going to get

93
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,158
problems in the group bugs are going to

94
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:31,919
show up powdery mildew is going to show

95
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:34,479
up things are going to happen that is

96
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:36,878
how life goes in a grow environment

97
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:38,878
whether it's indoors outdoors greenhouse

98
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:41,598
whatever you're doing there's the huge

99
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:43,280
opportunity very high likelihood for

100
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:45,839
bugs especially if you're growing in an

101
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,400
area where i grow where i live it's

102
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,080
legal here everybody grows everybody

103
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,400
works in a commercial facility or a

104
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,159
dispensary or their boyfriend or cousin

105
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,480
or roommate or somebody is involved in a

106
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:58,239
growth somewhere so we're all trading

107
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:59,840
bugs we go to a house to go play video

108
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,759
games or smoke with a friend you sit on

109
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,519
the couch and you're just passing spider

110
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:04,959
mites back and forth you go to your

111
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,799
other friend's house you take the mites

112
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,479
there or you get thermites that's just

113
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,400
how it works when everybody works in a

114
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:12,238
gross we've got to stay on top of it

115
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,319
you're gonna get bugs don't let the bugs

116
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,319
discourage you don't let them scare you

117
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:19,039
if we know what to do and how to

118
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:20,798
identify bugs before the time comes we

119
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,680
don't panic as much so i try to be

120
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:26,719
prepared try to read about what's coming

121
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,478
try to know what to expect try to google

122
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,080
research things i'm going to do a little

123
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:31,519
bit of that work for you

124
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:33,199
so you're going to get bugs no matter

125
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:36,240
how well you set up your grow how well

126
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:38,240
you design your things things may happen

127
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,759
so don't feel like uh like you've done

128
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,199
something wrong don't feel like you've

129
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,879
got shame or something you've got

130
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,879
something to hide if you've got bugs

131
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:46,478
it's a good learning opportunity and the

132
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:48,719
pride will come when you defeat the

133
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:51,039
problem and have a successful crop even

134
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,440
though you did have some fears in the

135
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,800
beginning or middle of the cycle all

136
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:57,199
right so

137
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,879
um that is my kind of disclaimer my what

138
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,478
is that a preface there so we you're

139
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:02,000
gonna get bugs and don't feel like it

140
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:04,959
like you failed or anything it's very

141
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,759
common especially in my area in my

142
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:10,959
industry so uh the number one way to

143
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:13,759
prevent uh problems is to

144
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:16,879
have a plan in place before problems

145
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:19,199
ever even start prevention is key like i

146
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:21,519
said a moment ago learn how to identify

147
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,360
bugs have a strategy where are you

148
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:25,198
growing i just said that i'm in i'm in

149
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,280
colorado it's legal to grow here i can

150
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,199
have six plants in my home everybody's

151
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:32,719
got six plants in their home anybody my

152
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:35,680
age in my age range uh if you're 21 to

153
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,880
45 maybe 60 you've probably got six

154
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,959
plants in your home if you've got a

155
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:40,879
medical marijuana recommendation you can

156
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:42,399
have six more so you may have up to 12

157
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:43,918
plants in your home

158
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:45,758
that means there's probably one house on

159
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:47,758
every block growing in my opinion in my

160
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,360
experience honestly it's about that

161
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,960
average

162
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,280
so where are you growing i know that

163
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:55,038
here in colorado everybody like i said

164
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:57,198
has got spider mites powdery mildew

get the bugs and it will help you out

186
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,759
tremendously a little bit of training

ahead of time and you'll know how to

188
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,600
react without going into panic mode

189
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:46,079
panic mode

190
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:48,479
panic mode in the garden causes more

191
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:50,639
problems than it ever fixes i see people

192
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:52,079
just decide to do random crazy [ __ ]

193
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,160
because they had a problem that was a

194
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:57,439
level two and they're like well then i

195
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:59,520
sprayed i defoliated i over watered i

196
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:01,279
changed the light cycle and then i fed

197
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:02,560
it completely different nutrients and

198
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:04,478
i'm like well you just took that level

199
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,800
two problem and made it a level seven by

200
00:07:04,478 --> 00:07:08,478
doing too many damn things to the plants

201
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,160
if you know what you're doing know how

202
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:13,038
to not panic you've got a much more

203
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:15,520
likelihood of a successful rescue or an

204
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:17,680
eradication of a problem so know what

205
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:20,000
problems are coming know what to expect

206
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,478
what kind of bugs are in your area most

207
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,759
common bugs for every grow you're going

208
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:27,038
to see spider mites fungus gnats thrips

209
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,639
i'm sure there's other stuff that we'll

210
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:30,079
talk about aphids are common especially

211
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,319
if you're growing outdoors everybody

212
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:34,800
gets worms and caterpillars outdoors

213
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,319
know what is coming prepare for those

214
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,759
things

215
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:42,960
then the next step is to think uh how

216
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:46,160
nuclear or organic do you want to go to

217
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:48,478
treat your garden for pest prevention

218
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,160
are you going to spray heavy pesticides

219
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:52,878
are you going to spray heavy fungicides

220
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:55,520
or are you only going to go with organic

221
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:57,039
pesticides and fungicides or are you not

222
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:59,519
going to spray at all are you going to

223
00:07:57,038 --> 00:08:01,918
use predator predator bugs in your

224
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:04,000
garden there are many very useful

225
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:05,839
insects that we can order

226
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,598
we can purchase them online or locally

227
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:09,839
from insectiaries if you have one near

228
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:12,000
you you can get live bugs delivered to

229
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:13,839
your grow and you can disperse those

230
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,839
live insects in your grow and they will

231
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:18,079
eat the problem bugs they will stick

232
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:19,758
around if you buy the right insects

233
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:21,918
they'll make babies and they'll keep

234
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,759
breeding in your garden those bugs are

235
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:25,198
beneficial they don't eat your plants

236
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,759
they don't cause any problems and they

237
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:29,759
work as security guards for the other

238
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,879
bugs if some spider might show up they

239
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,599
eat them

240
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:36,560
if you do decide to use sprays as your

241
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:39,278
plan of attack for pests and fungus

242
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:41,359
how harsh or gentle of a chemical will

243
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:42,958
you allow yourself to use in your garden

244
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,680
do you want to use something that is

245
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:47,439
crazy from uh some monsanto product or

246
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:49,759
do you just want to use some hippie uh

247
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,839
oil sprays where is your boundary where

248
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:53,600
is your uh your threshold there what

249
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,360
will and will you not use start thinking

250
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,440
about that now start researching the

251
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:00,159
products and find out what you are

252
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,920
comfortable with i don't like um

253
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:03,838
neem oil neem oil will make if you're

254
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:06,559
going to use your your finished product

255
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:08,240
for concentrates or any i don't like

256
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:09,838
neem oil neem oil will stick around in

257
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,240
the flavor of your product most of those

258
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:14,320
botanical oils and essential oils are

259
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,839
not good for growing cannabis in my

260
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,200
opinion because they stick around and

261
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,920
you will taste it in the finished

262
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:22,240
product if you use it too much so let me

263
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:23,679
find my notes again and see where i am

264
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,639
are you going to spray are you going to

265
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:29,599
use predator bugs i do have a note here

266
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:31,600
that says in my opinion ladybugs are

267
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,720
basically useless i know a lot of people

268
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,120
are going to throw their arms up in the

269
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,839
air and go what i love ladybugs

270
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,839
in my opinion for their price they are

271
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,680
not cost effective they're not hungry

272
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,279
enough they're not aggressive enough

273
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:44,559
they don't stick around long enough they

274
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:46,799
fly away

275
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:48,639
you release a [ __ ] ton of ladybugs

276
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:50,240
however many however many ladybugs you

277
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:51,919
release tomorrow you're only going to

278
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,080
have half of them if it's indoors

279
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:55,360
outdoors greenhouse whatever half of

280
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,560
them are going to fly into the lights

281
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,240
half of them are going to fly into the

282
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:59,838
blowers half of them are just going to

283
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,799
die because they don't have any food or

284
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,480
they don't know what they're doing it's

285
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:04,399
just overpopulated with ladybugs

286
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,079
suddenly they just die

287
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,679
then by halfway through that day you've

288
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:09,759
only got a third by the end of that day

289
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:11,439
you've probably got a quarter this is my

290
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:13,519
experience with ladybugs you let a bunch

291
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,920
of them go you end up sweeping them up

292
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,360
shop backing them up they stink you end

293
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:18,479
up crunching them on the floor now you

294
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,159
got to mop up the floor because you've

295
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,480
got scattered splattered ladybugs

296
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:24,000
everywhere i don't prefer ladybugs i see

297
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,639
people talk about it all the time on

298
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,559
social media

299
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:30,958
ladybugs are amateur hour there are much

300
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:32,879
more aggressive and qualified bugs out

301
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:35,759
there to do the job for you

302
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:37,838
swarskis persimilis hypoaspis miles

303
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:39,838
green lace wings i know i'm going fast

304
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:42,160
but you can do some research and you can

305
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:45,760
find those bugs that will work for you

306
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:47,360
which predators work in your environment

307
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:49,759
when you go shopping for predator

308
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,120
insects you can do a lot of research on

309
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:53,278
the website hopefully the website you

310
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:56,000
were looking at will tell you this

311
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:58,320
predator bug prefers this temperature

312
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,039
range and this humidity range the bugs

313
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:03,360
do have a vpd which they prefer also if

314
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:05,360
you don't have that type of a vpd then

315
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,959
you may want to get a different bug or

316
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,879
your insects that you just bought your

317
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:10,399
troopers your army your soldiers they

318
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:11,759
may come for a little while and hang out

319
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:13,440
and eat a couple of bugs and they'll go

320
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:14,799
you know what it's way too hot in here

321
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,760
bro they're gonna find an escape rod and

322
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:17,039
they're gonna go somewhere else and

323
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:18,799
they're gonna go to a garden where it's

324
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:20,000
a more appropriate temperature or

325
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:21,278
they'll just die off they'll quit

326
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,320
breeding they'll quit eating and they

327
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:26,799
will die off so find out the appropriate

328
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,640
predators for your environment a lot of

329
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:30,159
the good companies you can call them and

330
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:32,480
they will give you advice and guidance

331
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:35,919
you can say this is my greenhouse my

332
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,920
indoor my outdoor production

333
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,000
maybe be vague about cannabis but just

334
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:42,639
they don't care what plants you're

335
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,639
growing talk about canopy size and bug

336
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:46,559
infestation and bug pressure is what

337
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:48,000
they will be more worried about they're

338
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:50,078
going to want to know canopy size

339
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,240
temperature humidity environment

340
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:53,838
environmental swings things like that

341
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,560
then they're going to want to know what

342
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,800
pest are you trying to eradicate so get

343
00:11:56,559 --> 00:12:00,638
a good idea of which insects you need

344
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:02,639
for your environment and also be

345
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,879
prepared for which insects are coming to

346
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:07,919
your grow very commonly you're going to

347
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:09,200
get spider mites thrips fungus gnats

348
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:10,479
aphids

349
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,720
if you're outdoors you're going to get

350
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:15,200
those moths that lay eggs in there and

351
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,560
those moths turn into worms and they

352
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,639
become caterpillars and they become

353
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:21,039
butterflies i don't know what they are

354
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:22,799
in colorado we get a lot of melon worms

355
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:24,719
here in southern colorado they're orange

356
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:26,319
worms that grow in the buds

357
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:30,000
they'll really wreak havoc on your

358
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:31,920
plants quite quickly so which insects do

359
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,440
you think you're going to use uh find

360
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:36,000
out if they're cost effective for your

361
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:38,000
area can you afford those insects

362
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,679
learn how you're going to disperse them

363
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,200
some of them have to be hung up on each

364
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:42,559
individual plant some come in a

365
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,240
container and you just take off the lid

366
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:45,359
and they start climbing out you just got

367
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,759
to move them around a little bit

368
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,360
depending on the size of your grow it

369
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:51,838
may have may require a little bit of

370
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,919
manpower to spread out those

371
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,720
sachets or however they are delivered to

372
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:56,240
you

373
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,240
let me see where i'm in my notes i did

374
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,440
get lost uh which predators are you

375
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,399
going to use which bugs are you going to

376
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,240
battle

377
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:04,480
now let's talk about spraying are you

378
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,639
capable of spraying i don't know how

379
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:09,360
physically capable you are you may have

380
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:11,360
to mix up a 5 gallon 10 maybe a 20

381
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,440
gallon container of water with

382
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,039
pesticides mixed into it with fungicides

383
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,600
mixed into that and then you may have to

384
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:19,759
spray a large area i don't know your

385
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,600
physical limitations i try to keep in

386
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:23,519
mind some people aren't completely

387
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,519
physically able like some people are so

388
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,600
maybe you need to get predator bugs and

389
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,039
let them out maybe you have to spray

390
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,879
because you can't disperse the predator

391
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:32,480
bugs what's gonna work best for you what

392
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:33,759
can you physically manage do you have a

393
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,519
crew do you have a staff do you have a

394
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:37,200
helper do you have a couple strapping

395
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,720
young lads out there that can just be in

396
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,160
the heat all day putting out bugs or

397
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,160
maybe a guy that can suit up in the

398
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:43,600
middle of the day don't spray during the

399
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:45,439
day can't turn off the lights if you're

400
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,040
in the greenhouse but if you're outside

401
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,639
or whatever do you have a guy that can

402
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:50,399
spray when the sun goes down or before

403
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:52,639
the sun comes up do you have somebody

404
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,919
capable of spraying so think about that

405
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:56,560
sort of stuff are you going to be able

406
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:59,198
to stick to a routine and a cycle you

407
00:13:56,559 --> 00:14:00,958
can get the bugs delivered on a schedule

408
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:03,120
if you set up a deal with the places

409
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:05,919
that deliver the bugs they can come once

410
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,839
a week every two weeks twice a week

411
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:09,039
however you want to set up a routine and

412
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:10,639
they'll know what's best for you

413
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:13,198
depending on the

414
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:15,198
infestation the pest pressure the

415
00:14:13,198 --> 00:14:16,479
beneficial insect you're buying and the

416
00:14:15,198 --> 00:14:18,399
environment in which you're putting it

417
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,879
in the insectaries will have great

418
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,320
recommendations on frequency

419
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:24,480
and maybe they will try to sell you

420
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,399
extra but it is always better to have

421
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,560
extra security guards than not enough

422
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,958
you want more on your team so the other

423
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:32,799
team can't take over

424
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:35,198
if your gang is bigger you got a better

425
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:37,759
chance of winning um let me keep going

426
00:14:35,198 --> 00:14:39,838
to figure out how where i am

427
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:41,519
okay let's talk about spraying now if

428
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:44,399
you're spraying indoors that is a good

429
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:46,799
option i am hesitant of spraying

430
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,159
outdoors because in my opinion

431
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:50,479
i don't want to

432
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:52,159
disrupt the balance outdoors i don't do

433
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,759
a lot of outdoor growing i may have a

434
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:55,679
greenhouse project happening this year

435
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:58,000
that i haven't talked about but i don't

436
00:14:55,679 --> 00:15:00,399
do a lot of outdoor growing if i were to

437
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,399
grow outdoors i would use beneficial

438
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:06,559
insects and predator bugs as my way of

439
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,559
taking care of pest pressure

440
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,800
my reasoning for not wanting to spray

441
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,800
outside is i feel it disrupts the

442
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:14,319
outside outside is already doing its

443
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:16,000
thing it's great outside if we don't

444
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,240
mess with it outside is perfect it's

445
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,879
perfectly sustainable humans are what

446
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:23,198
mess up outside we put our plants out

447
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:25,679
there we're going to get a bug out there

448
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:27,838
uh something most likely is going to eat

449
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:29,838
that bug then that bug is either going

450
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:32,959
to move on or try to make home in our

451
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:34,720
plants then in most cases another bug

452
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:36,239
will come get rid of that

453
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,240
we do have to draw the line somewhere we

454
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,680
can't just have a bug battle happening

455
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,600
in our plants every day and there are

456
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:43,439
some things like i've seen spider mites

457
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,040
build webs and take over gardens really

458
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,519
quickly without any interaction or

459
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:49,838
prevention but i think that outside if

460
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:52,480
we mess around too much we do cause more

461
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:54,240
problems so my opinion

462
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,320
my preference would be to use the

463
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,079
beneficial insects for the outdoor grow

464
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,160
that way we're not spraying things we're

465
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:02,239
not destroying the environment that

466
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:04,319
patch of land you're growing on may be

467
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,079
yours it may not be it could be somebody

468
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,959
else's land you just snuck on don't be a

469
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:11,599
dick but either way treat that land with

470
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:13,838
respect that that 10 by 10 patch of land

471
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:16,000
may be yours everything around it is

472
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:17,920
ours somebody out there owns it somebody

473
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,320
next door to you owns it the environment

474
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:22,240
that it is actually a part of is all of

475
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,759
ours and please respect it and take good

476
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,198
care of it i don't know where your

477
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,320
sprays are going i don't know what

478
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:28,559
you're doing to the earth the

479
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,480
environment the air all of that stuff

480
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:32,000
we're sharing it keep that in mind

481
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,759
please i'm sure that most people

482
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,919
listening to my show

483
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,680
are gonna be very gentle and very

484
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:40,078
courteous and very mindful but still

485
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:42,159
keep in mind that that patch of land

486
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:44,239
that you're [ __ ] up for this one grow

487
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:46,078
season to have a successful crop that's

488
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,480
also our land that's also our

489
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:50,319
environment you won't be here forever

490
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,240
hopefully that land outlives you and

491
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,480
there are other generations that have to

492
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,159
live on that land let's not make it have

493
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,839
to live on that land let's make it they

494
00:16:56,159 --> 00:17:00,559
get to live on that land that you did

495
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,920
not destroy contaminate uh

496
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:03,838
what's the word i'm looking for make it

497
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:05,678
infertile let's not do that to the land

498
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:07,199
around us let's have respect all right

499
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,959
that's enough of my hippie ramble but

500
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,640
really you guys keep that stuff in mind

501
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,480
when you're spraying you're spraying

502
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,079
your area but where's the drift going

503
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,759
where's the pesticide going what are the

504
00:17:14,078 --> 00:17:17,438
long-term effects you were doing to that

505
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:19,599
plot of land what are you doing to the

506
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,798
ecosystem the balance the environment

507
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,159
and now you're gonna say yeah but you're

508
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:24,240
gonna release a bunch of beneficial

509
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,600
insects yeah uh they're beneficial

510
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,359
insects they're gonna help the garden

511
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:28,959
they're not gonna there's not chemical

512
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:30,719
stuff it's not gonna change the earth

513
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,558
for a long time and they're gonna help

514
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,798
out my fellow neighbor growers by eating

515
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:36,960
their pests as well all right let me

516
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:38,558
find my notes and get back where i am

517
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,360
now i know i did mention this already

518
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:44,160
but think about your strategy before it

519
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:46,159
is time to attack i know we don't want

520
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,919
bugs i know we don't want to have to get

521
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,759
in there or go out there and attack a

522
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:52,160
bunch of bugs and try to fix a problem

523
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:54,160
but have a plan in place what are you

524
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,000
going to do you know i keep talking

525
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,080
about greenhouse environments indoor

526
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,640
outdoor environments here is a huge

527
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:02,639
piece of advice we have built if you

528
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,400
have built a nice indoor environment

529
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,919
you've hung up your lights you've put up

530
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,600
the reflective coating on the wall

531
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,038
you've cleaned up the flooring real well

532
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:10,959
you went and bought a bunch of brand new

533
00:18:09,038 --> 00:18:13,038
gear we ran ducting we've got a carbon

534
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:15,038
filter in there if you're growing plants

535
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:16,960
indoors please

536
00:18:15,038 --> 00:18:18,240
don't take them outside i know you're

537
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,519
going to want to take them outside it's

538
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,960
like taking them for a walk you're going

539
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:22,798
to go get them some fresh air some

540
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,120
sunshine go expose them to the

541
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:27,519
environment but you're also going to

542
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:29,038
expose them to all of the bugs that are

543
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:30,960
outside and then you're gonna bring that

544
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:33,519
precious plant with its new uh

545
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:36,240
passengers its stowaways into your

546
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:38,639
beautiful grow now in your grow you are

547
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,480
creating the most perfect environment

548
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,640
hopefully you've got the most ideal

549
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:45,120
environment for that plant but also

550
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:47,440
that's the most ideal beautiful perfect

551
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:49,839
environment for whatever bugs you just

552
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,038
brought in on that plant to thrive

553
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:53,599
they're going to have a party they're

554
00:18:51,038 --> 00:18:55,599
going to say dude it is 77 degrees in

555
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:57,599
here it is the perfect humidity in here

556
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:59,678
there's not too much wind in here the

557
00:18:57,599 --> 00:19:02,240
light cycle is the same constantly

558
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:04,480
there's no pest pressure there's no rain

559
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,079
there's no do in the morning there's no

560
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,558
problem we could just have a party in

561
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:10,399
here it is the island of jamaica for the

562
00:19:08,558 --> 00:19:11,759
pests they're just gonna start partying

563
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,280
and then they're gonna start breeding in

564
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:15,279
there and then within a couple of days

565
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:16,639
you're gonna go oh i really [ __ ] up

566
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:18,079
putting that plant outside and bringing

567
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,720
it back in here because there's nothing

568
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:22,240
to stop that uh that party they're gonna

569
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,600
breed and they're gonna eat and they're

570
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,839
gonna breed and they're gonna eat and

571
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:28,399
they're just gonna take over your garden

572
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:30,480
so i really recommend not taking your

573
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,160
plants outside and bringing them back in

574
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,160
if you've got indoor plants they should

575
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,320
be indoor plants if you've got outdoor

576
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,160
plants those are outdoor plants if you

577
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:40,000
got greenhouse plants those are

578
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,080
greenhouse plants

579
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,679
really i wouldn't recommend bringing i

580
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:45,359
see it all the time on social media put

581
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,280
the plants outside today for a couple of

582
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:49,199
hours and i'm like oh you're gonna take

583
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:50,639
them indoors and contaminate the entire

584
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,120
grow space then you got to reclaim that

585
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,880
whole grow space yeah you've created

586
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:56,719
that beautiful indoor grow environment

587
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,720
let's just leave them in there they will

588
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,798
they will appreciate it now let's talk

589
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,880
about pest management

590
00:20:00,798 --> 00:20:04,400
we have talked about prevention

591
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,760
we've talked about thinking about what

592
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,880
we might use

593
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:11,919
let's talk about identifying our bugs

594
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,760
learn to identify bugs how about now

595
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,520
maybe you don't have an infestation now

596
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:18,240
right how about now while you're

597
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:21,359
listening to me maybe just google spider

598
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:23,440
mites two spotted spider mites ah russet

599
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:25,519
mites google all of the common spider

600
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,440
mites that could be found in your area

601
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:29,200
that way you know what they look like

602
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,519
then let's start looking for what does

603
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,120
spider mite damage look like it looks

604
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:34,639
like somebody just took your leaves and

605
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:36,798
just started poking it with a little

606
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,159
little needle and all the juices came

607
00:20:36,798 --> 00:20:40,079
out of that leaf where you poked it and

608
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:42,640
it just starts getting dry and they call

609
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:44,480
it stip stipule stipule i think that's

610
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,919
the word we learned in art class i

611
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,919
forgot the word it looks like somebody

612
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:49,280
just was just poking at that leaf and

613
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:50,880
just trying to just poke it and make a

614
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:52,399
little it'll look gradient it'll be

615
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,919
green and then it'll kind of gradient to

616
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,360
like a dead yellowy color and that's

617
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,360
where the spider mites are just having

618
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:59,119
lunch and they're probably on the

619
00:20:57,359 --> 00:21:00,879
underside of the leaf so pull off that

620
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:03,279
leaf and take a look at it

621
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,039
right along the main vein of the leaves

622
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:06,480
the long main vein they'll be tucked up

623
00:21:05,038 --> 00:21:07,839
there under the edge trying to hide

624
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,440
laying eggs

625
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:12,079
maybe you need a microscope or some sort

626
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,440
of magnification but pull off a leaf and

627
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:14,720
take a look you're going to find them

628
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,120
right there at the bottom so learn to

629
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,640
identify the bugs which we are expecting

630
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:21,038
to encounter

631
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,320
learn to identify spider mites uh learn

632
00:21:21,038 --> 00:21:24,480
to identify

633
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:26,639
who the devil in my opinion one of the

634
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,599
worst insects to face i'm not afraid of

635
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,240
most

636
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:32,000
i can battle and conquer almost any

637
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,839
infestation you'll get in a grow whether

638
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,519
it's a home grow a commercial

639
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:37,519
environment a greenhouse outdoor i'm not

640
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:40,639
the expert but most other places we will

641
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:43,038
conquer all problems my biggest fear my

642
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,799
biggest adversary would be

643
00:21:43,038 --> 00:21:46,960
the russet might those things are the

644
00:21:44,798 --> 00:21:49,200
[ __ ] devil learn how to identify them

645
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:51,519
learn how to identify the signs of their

646
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,880
presence in your garden they will trick

647
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:54,480
you they will make you think you've got

648
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,400
nutrient problems they'll make you think

649
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,000
you've got watering problems they'll

650
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,240
make you think the plants are just doing

651
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,640
weird [ __ ] and then you'll realize

652
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,159
oh i've got russet mites russet mites

653
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,759
are the devil that's the biggest problem

654
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:07,280
in the garden i do know how to get rid

655
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:09,759
of them but it does take a little bit of

656
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:11,839
uh some strategy and some persistence

657
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:13,839
you got to be on top of that [ __ ] so

658
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:16,720
learn to identify those bugs spotted

659
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:19,839
mites spider mites uh russet mites

660
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:22,240
aphids aphids are easy because

661
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:23,678
aphids have uh tailpipes if you look

662
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,839
they look like a little volkswagen

663
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:27,200
beetle with tailpipes two exhaust pipes

664
00:22:25,839 --> 00:22:29,678
coming out of them aphids always have

665
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,440
exhaust pipes uh and they come in all

666
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:33,038
colors i've been seeing new colors of

667
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,558
aphids which i've never seen before in

668
00:22:33,038 --> 00:22:36,879
colorado it's like every year we get a

669
00:22:34,558 --> 00:22:38,558
new color of aphid so if you got a

670
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:41,520
little green bug a little white bug a

671
00:22:38,558 --> 00:22:42,879
little it could be purple brown yellow

672
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:45,599
i've seen them of all colors i haven't

673
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:47,600
seen a blue aphid yet um have i no i

674
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:50,079
haven't seen purple or blue aphids but

675
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:51,519
anyway aphids can be all colors so those

676
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:52,798
weird looking little

677
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:54,240
shiny

678
00:22:52,798 --> 00:22:56,079
volkswagen beetle looking things that

679
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,880
are climbing around uh those are

680
00:22:56,079 --> 00:23:00,399
possibly aphids in your grow thrips you

681
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:03,360
probably won't see the thrips they're

682
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,640
tiny what you will see is uh honeydew it

683
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:06,079
looks like they just looks like they

684
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,840
blew their nose or something blew your

685
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:09,119
nose bullet's nose on your lower leaves

686
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:10,158
it'll be on the bottom leaves of the

687
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:12,000
plant because the thrips likes to go

688
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:13,440
hang out in the soil and they come up at

689
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,159
night and they [ __ ] all over your leaves

690
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,400
so

691
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:17,760
that's called honeydew thrips are super

692
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,759
easy to get rid of people panic when

693
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:22,158
they see thrips those are easy easy to

694
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:24,960
get rid of white flies white flies uh

695
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:26,640
you may confuse a thrip or a fungus gnat

696
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,000
let me [ __ ] try to say that again i'm

697
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,240
not even going to edit that

698
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,319
white flies you may confuse a white fly

699
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,079
with an aphid if it flies away when you

700
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:36,079
tap the plant that's a white fly

701
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:37,439
sometimes you'll be watering and you'll

702
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:39,519
bump the plant just gently just like i

703
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,919
did this mic stand and you'll just see

704
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:43,839
little ashy bugs come flying out those

705
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:47,120
[ __ ] are white flies they are very

706
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:49,599
easy to eradicate uh those are more uh

707
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:51,759
of an annoyance than a problem they can

708
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:53,278
be a vector and lead to further issues

709
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:54,640
but really they're more just annoying

710
00:23:53,278 --> 00:23:56,079
and obnoxious than anything else and

711
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,278
they [ __ ] up your pictures they get in

712
00:23:56,079 --> 00:23:59,119
your face

713
00:23:57,278 --> 00:24:01,119
those suck

714
00:23:59,119 --> 00:24:02,719
just like fungus gnats fungus gnats are

715
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:04,639
obnoxious and they fly around as well if

716
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,319
you tap the pot and these little black

717
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,400
flies come out those little [ __ ] are

718
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:10,158
fungus gnats that's probably from over

719
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,400
watering if you don't over water as

720
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:14,480
frequently let the soil dry up a little

721
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,759
bit you'll have less likelihood for

722
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,599
fungus gnats

723
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:19,519
something i've learned if you run

724
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:21,038
canon led lighting from black sail

725
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:23,839
market big shout out to my buddy keith

726
00:24:21,038 --> 00:24:26,879
at blacksail if you run the canon leds

727
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:29,519
the diode is about the size of a 50 cent

728
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,360
piece and i think the fungus gnats are

729
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:33,359
attracted to it they fly right into that

730
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:35,439
50 cent piece of a light and they fall

731
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:37,199
directly down onto the plant that is

732
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,558
right below that so you could just go

733
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,880
scoop them up off of that plant and

734
00:24:38,558 --> 00:24:42,079
you'll be able to identify your fungus

735
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,919
gnats you'll know it's like a little

736
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:46,079
indicator a little marker you'll know

737
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:47,759
they're there because that led light is

738
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:49,199
just nuking them they can't resist it

739
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:50,960
they fly right into it and they hit it

740
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,640
and they go oh that's too hot and then

741
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,159
they cook and they just fall right onto

742
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,919
the plants below

743
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,520
all right i did mention that outdoors

744
00:24:55,919 --> 00:25:00,320
you're going to get caterpillars and

745
00:24:57,519 --> 00:25:01,440
melon beetles those are not the easiest

746
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:03,200
to get rid of you're going to have to

747
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,679
treat with some probably some spray

748
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,278
products i'm not sure what predators are

749
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:09,200
large enough maybe a praying mantis

750
00:25:07,278 --> 00:25:11,119
maybe a giant lacewing

751
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,360
maybe big enough to eat some of those

752
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:14,479
caterpillars and melon beetles

753
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:16,319
those are things you're going to see

754
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,278
outdoors possibly in the greenhouse i

755
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:18,639
hope you don't get those in the

756
00:25:17,278 --> 00:25:21,679
greenhouse

757
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:23,440
more stuff you might see powdery mildew

758
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:25,200
powdery mildew is very common i keep

759
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,640
saying it's powdery mildew season here

760
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,720
in colorado

761
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:31,520
temperature swings humidity swings

762
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:33,759
diurnal swings will definitely lead to

763
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:34,960
powdery mildew here in colorado over

764
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:36,720
foliation

765
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,798
over leafy plants

766
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:41,519
low circulation things like that will

767
00:25:38,798 --> 00:25:42,960
definitely lead to powdery mildew

768
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:44,319
powdery mildew is definitely something

769
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,400
you'll run into in a greenhouse

770
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:47,759
environment very commonly we get it here

771
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:50,240
in colorado because we have a lot of

772
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:53,038
drastic temperature changes uh powdery

773
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:55,599
mildew is not very hard to get rid of

774
00:25:53,038 --> 00:25:57,440
it's also very easy to prevent you can

775
00:25:55,599 --> 00:25:59,599
spray a few products on your plants

776
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,278
there are some organic products that you

777
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:03,199
could spray that will work as a

778
00:26:01,278 --> 00:26:06,240
preventative i wasn't going to talk a

779
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:08,640
lot about stuff like that but i like

780
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,480
for a preventative and a corrective

781
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,559
product in a

782
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:15,200
powdery mildew situation i like the

783
00:26:12,558 --> 00:26:17,278
products cease i haven't used it but

784
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,679
i've seen a lot of great success with

785
00:26:17,278 --> 00:26:20,798
green cure and then if it really gets

786
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:23,600
nasty

787
00:26:20,798 --> 00:26:26,240
xerotal 2.0 is not organic but it is a

788
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:28,319
good product we've got a lot of options

789
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:30,558
but if you spray it with the c su or a

790
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:32,240
combination of the two you'll prevent a

791
00:26:30,558 --> 00:26:34,480
nice protective layer those are

792
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,720
beneficial bacterias that eat the

793
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:40,000
powdery mildew or one of them eats the

794
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,759
powdery mildew one creates a surface uh

795
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,679
ph on the leaf surface that makes it

796
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:45,919
undesirable for powdery mildew to

797
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:48,080
colonize so those are a couple of ways

798
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:49,919
to help you prevent powdery mildew

799
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:51,759
prevention there from a fungus you can

800
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:54,000
do that indoors outdoors greenhouse

801
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:56,400
environments uh cease is organic it's a

802
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,400
little bit expensive but it's cheaper

803
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,559
than powdery mildew

804
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,640
now another thing that is very important

805
00:27:00,558 --> 00:27:06,319
when it comes to integrated pest

806
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:08,000
management is scouting and indicators do

807
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:09,678
you know what you're looking for do you

808
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,519
know the signs of pests i've talked

809
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:13,360
about a couple of things to look for

810
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:14,558
spider mites you're gonna see stipuling

811
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:16,639
little pokeys you're gonna see little

812
00:27:14,558 --> 00:27:18,720
crawly bugs on the bottom of the leaves

813
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,159
if you see webbing you've got spider

814
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,600
mites and you have not been paying

815
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:23,840
attention it's time to get in there and

816
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:25,599
get rid of those [ __ ] things uh the

817
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:27,278
aphids you're gonna see little skittles

818
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:28,480
crawling around your plants thrips

819
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:30,079
you're gonna see the honeydew white

820
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,519
flies you'll see the ashes flying around

821
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:32,879
fungus gnats are little black things

822
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:34,798
flying around

823
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,559
caterpillars and melon beetles and

824
00:27:34,798 --> 00:27:39,839
orange worms those are going to be

825
00:27:36,558 --> 00:27:42,319
obvious uh powdery mildew looks like

826
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:43,678
you're starting to put powdered sugar on

827
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:45,200
the plants it looks like you were eating

828
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:46,559
a powdered donut and just dribbled it

829
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,558
right onto the plant that's what that

830
00:27:46,558 --> 00:27:51,519
looks like so uh do you know what you're

831
00:27:48,558 --> 00:27:53,359
looking for know the signs of bugs and

832
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:54,960
powdery mildew also pay attention for

833
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:56,798
bud rot but that's a little bit later in

834
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,399
the season when you've got buds if the

835
00:27:56,798 --> 00:28:00,558
inside of that bud looks brown and

836
00:27:58,398 --> 00:28:02,719
squishy and shitty you've got bud rot

837
00:28:00,558 --> 00:28:05,038
i'm sorry that happened to you um

838
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,880
scouting and indicators uh does the

839
00:28:05,038 --> 00:28:08,558
whole crew if you're working with a crew

840
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,559
more people than just yourself do they

841
00:28:08,558 --> 00:28:12,879
all know what they're looking for do you

842
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:15,278
have a specific person scouting every

843
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:17,200
day yes every day you should look at

844
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:18,558
every plant every single day if you're

845
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,640
looking for pests there should be one

846
00:28:18,558 --> 00:28:23,359
person or a team of people trained to

847
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:25,840
identify and scout four pests what are

848
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:27,599
your indicators a lot of people use

849
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:29,359
yellow sticky traps in their garden

850
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:32,319
unfortunately they're thinking that that

851
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:34,719
is a pest eradicator that is not a way

852
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:37,278
to get rid of pests that is simply there

853
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,880
to tell you you have got pests you look

854
00:28:37,278 --> 00:28:41,038
at the yellow sticky trap every day

855
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,880
maybe twice a day maybe take a peek at

856
00:28:41,038 --> 00:28:45,359
it before you leave the grow take a peek

857
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:47,440
when you come back and see how many bugs

858
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:49,038
are sticking to that yellow sticky trap

859
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,038
you're gonna get a few bugs just because

860
00:28:49,038 --> 00:28:52,480
life has bugs there are bugs wherever

861
00:28:51,038 --> 00:28:54,240
you are you may get a fly i'm sure you

862
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,599
saw the little gnat flying around here

863
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,000
may get some mosquitoes or something

864
00:28:55,599 --> 00:28:59,759
stuck to it but do you have a bunch of

865
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,759
white flies or a bunch of fungus gnats

866
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:03,359
or a bunch of something unidentifiable

867
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:05,599
stuck to those sticky cards pay

868
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:07,599
attention let them be indicators as soon

869
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:09,918
as you see that number getting towards

870
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:11,519
concerning it's time to step up your

871
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:13,840
prevention maybe start doing an

872
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:15,759
eradication maybe start putting more

873
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:18,158
beneficial insects into the room it's

874
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:19,679
time to start rethinking your strategy

875
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:22,559
if you're seeing the numbers on the

876
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:23,679
cards get too high do scouting don't be

877
00:29:22,558 --> 00:29:25,759
afraid

878
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:27,360
i talk a lot about defoliating when

879
00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:28,720
you're defoliating don't be afraid to

880
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:30,319
take off a few leaves and flip them

881
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,839
upside down and take a moment to see

882
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:34,000
what you've got going on on the bottom

883
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:36,639
of those leaves are there bugs are there

884
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,558
eggs take some time enjoy your plants

885
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,640
spend a minute with them inspect them

886
00:29:38,558 --> 00:29:43,519
scout them now let's talk about plant

887
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:45,679
damage and other signs of trouble do you

888
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:47,440
see signs of trouble do you see plant

889
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:49,360
damage i've told you what to look for

890
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:52,159
are you in there every day looking for

891
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:53,359
it the problem the problem plant i can

892
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:54,799
already tell you it's the one in the

893
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:56,639
back corner that you don't [ __ ] with

894
00:29:54,798 --> 00:29:58,798
enough that's the one that's got the

895
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,640
bugs on it get back there and look at it

896
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:02,158
love that plant give it kisses why are

897
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,679
you annoying why are you avoiding that

898
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:05,520
one plant what did it do to you there's

899
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:06,880
always that one in the grow it's always

900
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:08,798
just back there or back there in the

901
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,399
corner that's the one with bugs and

902
00:30:08,798 --> 00:30:11,839
those bugs are gonna move on pretty soon

903
00:30:10,398 --> 00:30:14,319
and they're gonna be in the whole grow

904
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:15,839
so uh look for signs of damage do you

905
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:17,678
know what you're looking for do you know

906
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:20,000
what kind of bugs are doing that damage

907
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:22,640
now do you know how to react properly

908
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,240
with intent and purpose just because you

909
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,960
see bug damage doesn't mean you need to

910
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,880
go get pesticide a and heavily spray

911
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,798
pesticide a what if the pesticide you

912
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,880
just got is for spider mites and the

913
00:30:30,798 --> 00:30:34,240
bugs that you've got are thrips is it

914
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,760
going to work is it going to do anything

915
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,759
or did you just spray the plants with

916
00:30:35,759 --> 00:30:39,440
some stressful [ __ ] spend some money

917
00:30:37,759 --> 00:30:42,240
spend some time spend some energy on the

918
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:44,159
wrong thing let's identify the pest do

919
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:46,399
some research on the appropriate product

920
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:49,919
or beneficial insect to eradicate that

921
00:30:46,398 --> 00:30:52,639
pest and apply with intent and purpose

922
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:55,120
have a strategy have a schedule how

923
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:57,759
often do you need to apply this product

924
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:59,839
um how many days apart do i need to wait

925
00:30:57,759 --> 00:31:02,558
to apply this product what other

926
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:05,359
products can i apply with this and what

927
00:31:02,558 --> 00:31:07,038
other products can i not apply with this

928
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:09,119
some things you can't mix some things

929
00:31:07,038 --> 00:31:11,440
you can mix some things you shouldn't

930
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:13,199
spray maybe five to seven days apart

931
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:15,038
from each other you may want to wait uh

932
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,880
if you treat with any sulfur products

933
00:31:15,038 --> 00:31:19,038
don't treat with any oils for five to

934
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:21,440
seven days before or after and the

935
00:31:19,038 --> 00:31:22,960
opposite sulfurs and oils shouldn't mix

936
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,640
it's going to give you huge problems on

937
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:27,120
your plants so

938
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,559
be ready to react properly with intent

939
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:31,839
and purpose have

940
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:34,720
a good idea is to have multiple modes of

941
00:31:31,839 --> 00:31:36,720
attack if you've got uh swarovskis and

942
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,720
persimilis and hypoasmus miles and

943
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,399
lacewings in there you've got multiple

944
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,839
modes of attack three different bugs

945
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:44,158
going in there you can't run and hide

946
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:46,079
from three or four different bugs but if

947
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:48,240
you've got a tank mix with multiple

948
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:50,480
ingredients you can spray multiple

949
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:52,960
things in the garden at one time that

950
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:55,679
way you hit with multiple modes of

951
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:58,159
attack some pesticides simply make the

952
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:59,840
plants undesirable for the bugs the bugs

953
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:02,399
are like oh that's sticky and stinky i

954
00:31:59,839 --> 00:32:05,119
don't want to go there other pesticides

955
00:32:02,398 --> 00:32:07,359
will infect your bugs with a mushroom or

956
00:32:05,119 --> 00:32:10,000
a fungus that grows inside of them and

957
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:12,398
then explodes them other pesticides will

958
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,398
simply make the bugs forget to eat and

959
00:32:12,398 --> 00:32:16,158
then they just don't eat and they die

960
00:32:14,398 --> 00:32:17,839
some pesticides will make the bugs

961
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:20,080
unable to breed so they'll just keep

962
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:21,839
going but they can't make any more so

963
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:23,599
multiple modes of attack what if i hit

964
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:25,759
you with the pesticide that makes you

965
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:26,959
not want to breed and forget to eat and

966
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:28,319
now you're just not eating and you're

967
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,919
not breeding you're just walking around

968
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:31,359
going i don't have a purpose and then

969
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:32,960
you die and you don't come back and the

970
00:32:31,359 --> 00:32:34,879
bugs are gone so if you hit with

971
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:37,038
multiple modes of attack you can

972
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:38,240
definitely eradicate your problems more

973
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:40,240
quickly

974
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:41,919
here is something to keep in mind i'm

975
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:44,480
talking about multiple modes of attack

976
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:46,880
and multiple products in a tank mix

977
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:49,120
bugs will get what is known as

978
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:51,200
resistance to a pesticide just think

979
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:52,879
about if you walk in the room every day

980
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:55,600
and i punch you right in the jaw every

981
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:57,679
day day one is gonna [ __ ] hurt day

982
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:59,119
two it's gonna hurt day three it's gonna

983
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:00,640
suck day four

984
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:03,839
all right i got punched in the jog and

985
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:05,519
day five yup day six right in the jaw by

986
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:06,639
day 12 you're just going to walk out the

987
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:08,079
door and you're going to put your jaw up

988
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:10,080
there and take it and keep doing your

989
00:33:08,079 --> 00:33:12,398
thing if you keep spraying the bugs the

990
00:33:10,079 --> 00:33:13,519
same thing over and over and over again

991
00:33:12,398 --> 00:33:15,199
they're going to start drinking it up

992
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:17,200
like kool-aid and it's not going to do

993
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:19,759
anything to them it doesn't take very

994
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:21,919
long for some of these new bugs we've

995
00:33:19,759 --> 00:33:24,879
we've evolved these bugs so quickly by

996
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:26,880
doing this they've developed such quick

997
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:29,200
resistance to pesticides that we've got

998
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:31,278
to rotate and use multiple modes of

999
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:33,679
attack so rotate your pesticides to

1000
00:33:31,278 --> 00:33:37,200
prevent resistance

1001
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:39,360
one thing that the bug lady suzanne says

1002
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,798
you cannot build a resistance to being

1003
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:43,199
eaten so if you want to use those

1004
00:33:40,798 --> 00:33:45,440
predator bugs they will always win

1005
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,840
because you cannot build a resistance to

1006
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:49,360
being eaten there's no resistance

1007
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:51,278
especially if you power in numbers if

1008
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:53,599
you overdo it with those uh predator

1009
00:33:51,278 --> 00:33:54,880
insects you will definitely win

1010
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:56,558
let's see

1011
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:58,159
i've already said that i don't like neem

1012
00:33:56,558 --> 00:34:00,798
oil i don't like oils with a lot of

1013
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:02,720
fragrances especially like spearmint

1014
00:34:00,798 --> 00:34:04,000
oils peppermint oils

1015
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,759
any of that

1016
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,278
sticky oil that you spray on the plants

1017
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:09,358
that you can see it kind of stick and

1018
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:11,039
leave a shine onto the plant i don't

1019
00:34:09,358 --> 00:34:13,199
like spraying that sort of stuff because

1020
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:15,440
i make a lot of concentrates out of my

1021
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:17,598
products i want to smoke a concentrate

1022
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:19,440
that is oil free when you make

1023
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:21,838
concentrates from products that have

1024
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:24,639
been sprayed with oils you can see an

1025
00:34:21,838 --> 00:34:26,239
experienced concentrate maker

1026
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:28,639
consumer i'm not even an experienced

1027
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:30,559
maker and i can see it i can see the

1028
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:32,559
oils float to the top of the

1029
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:34,320
concentrates when you're putting oils

1030
00:34:32,559 --> 00:34:36,320
and weird sprays and [ __ ] in the plants

1031
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:37,919
we can see it some people know how to

1032
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:40,159
remove it i don't know how to do that

1033
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:42,480
part that's not my area of expertise but

1034
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:43,919
i can see it i can identify it on the

1035
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,320
top of the concentrate it's a little

1036
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:47,918
oily sheen just like if you mix oil and

1037
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:50,079
water together you can watch the oil

1038
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:51,918
float i can see that i can see the

1039
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:54,399
pesticides when the products are being

1040
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:56,000
processed so i don't like a lot of crazy

1041
00:34:54,398 --> 00:34:58,239
hippie oils i would rather just go with

1042
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,440
a pesticide or insects than some of

1043
00:34:58,239 --> 00:35:00,959
those

1044
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,639
lower level

1045
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,079
hippie oils they sell at the store you

1046
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:06,480
know which brands i'm talking about i

1047
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:09,039
skip all of that stuff

1048
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:12,000
now um spray properly whatever you're

1049
00:35:09,039 --> 00:35:14,159
going to spray spray properly do you

1050
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,320
need to spray the top of the leaf do you

1051
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:18,879
need to spray the underside of the leaf

1052
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:20,480
some products like to be sprayed what is

1053
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,680
called two runoff so you spray the

1054
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,519
plants until they're just [ __ ]

1055
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:25,919
dripping to where you got a puddle of

1056
00:35:23,519 --> 00:35:28,159
pesticide or offspray around the bottom

1057
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:30,559
of the plant some plants do some

1058
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:32,319
pesticides do not want to be sprayed to

1059
00:35:30,559 --> 00:35:34,159
run off so they just want you to spray

1060
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:36,160
the plant with enough just to get enough

1061
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:37,759
of it on there and it stays there and

1062
00:35:36,159 --> 00:35:39,759
then some of them you got to spray the

1063
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,119
underside of the leaf extreme like if

1064
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,720
you got spider mites you need to spray

1065
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:44,320
the underside of the leaves because

1066
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:45,838
that's where the bugs are if you're

1067
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,280
spraying for powdery mildew you need to

1068
00:35:45,838 --> 00:35:49,519
spray the top because that's where the

1069
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:53,119
powdery mildew is going to go so

1070
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:56,400
understand how to spray properly also

1071
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:58,000
understand the pesticides you are using

1072
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,838
all this is something i probably should

1073
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,400
have started with but every bottle that

1074
00:35:59,838 --> 00:36:04,799
you're going to use has a booklet on the

1075
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:08,079
front open up that booklet and read

1076
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:10,160
about the re-entry interval what when

1077
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:12,320
you spray a pesticide there's a amount

1078
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:14,319
of time you should leave your grow and

1079
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:16,079
not enter that because it is

1080
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,519
those pesticides are fresh and flying

1081
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:18,880
around you just sprayed bubbles in there

1082
00:36:17,519 --> 00:36:20,880
and you got wet pesticide in there you

1083
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,160
don't want to be rubbing up against it

1084
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,079
you don't want that in your lungs and

1085
00:36:22,159 --> 00:36:26,159
your skin there is something called the

1086
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:27,680
re-entry interval written on that

1087
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:30,159
booklet inside of your on your

1088
00:36:27,679 --> 00:36:31,838
pesticides read that book there is so

1089
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:34,639
much information in there there are

1090
00:36:31,838 --> 00:36:36,880
dosage recommendations there is a part

1091
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:38,639
that tells you what personal protective

1092
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:40,160
equipment to wear always where the

1093
00:36:38,639 --> 00:36:41,920
appropriate personal protective

1094
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:44,799
equipment when applying any type of

1095
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:46,800
pesticide if you're just spraying water

1096
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,640
if you're making small enough bubbles i

1097
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:51,119
like to wear a mask or a respirator i

1098
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:53,118
don't want to inhale micronized bubbles

1099
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:55,358
of anything into my lungs that doesn't

1100
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:56,800
sound like a good idea we got enough

1101
00:36:55,358 --> 00:36:58,480
[ __ ] to deal with right now with our

1102
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,480
lungs let's try to not poison

1103
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:02,480
contaminate and injure ourselves while

1104
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:04,719
trying to take care of our plants so

1105
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:07,599
proper personal protective equipment at

1106
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:09,358
all times it will be listed inside of

1107
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:11,200
the pesticide book right on the front of

1108
00:37:09,358 --> 00:37:13,039
the bottle you just pull out this one

1109
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:14,799
little book all the info you need is

1110
00:37:13,039 --> 00:37:16,320
right there just read the book it's only

1111
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:18,880
going to take you a couple of minutes

1112
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:20,559
and it may really really help you out

1113
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:23,200
use all of the recommended personal

1114
00:37:20,559 --> 00:37:25,199
protective equipment always use gloves i

1115
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:27,279
recommend like a paper tyvek suit if you

1116
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:29,598
can't invest in that get a long sleeve

1117
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:31,280
shirt wear that get some long pants

1118
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:33,440
always wear shoes and socks in the grove

1119
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:35,599
that cover up your feet the bottoms of

1120
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:38,079
your feet are one of the most absorbent

1121
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:39,200
parts for contaminants and pesticides so

1122
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:41,599
think about

1123
00:37:39,199 --> 00:37:43,759
spray a pesticide drips off the plant

1124
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:45,680
lands on the floor you're barefoot you

1125
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:47,920
step on that [ __ ] you're going to get

1126
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:49,519
maximum pesticide absorption and

1127
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,720
exposure that you could possibly get

1128
00:37:49,519 --> 00:37:52,239
through the bottoms of your feet there

1129
00:37:50,719 --> 00:37:53,439
are a couple other spots

1130
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:56,559
of course your genitals because you got

1131
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:58,400
that thin soft skin armpits face but the

1132
00:37:56,559 --> 00:38:00,000
bottoms of your feet are a prime spot

1133
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,559
for you to accidentally contaminate

1134
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,559
yourself so please wear the appropriate

1135
00:38:02,559 --> 00:38:06,320
personal protective equipment and read

1136
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:08,239
the bottles learn about the equipment

1137
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:10,880
the re-entry intervals and learn about

1138
00:38:08,239 --> 00:38:13,519
the toxicity levels of those products

1139
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:15,920
you're using does it say like warning

1140
00:38:13,519 --> 00:38:17,679
hazard danger poison it's gonna have

1141
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,440
words like that on there know what

1142
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:20,399
you're working with

1143
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:23,920
also

1144
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:25,760
maybe have the msds sheets available

1145
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:27,119
maybe have a spray log available if

1146
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,960
you're in a commercial environment those

1147
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:30,720
are required if you're in a personal

1148
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,720
grow you can get crazy and willy-nilly

1149
00:38:30,719 --> 00:38:35,199
with all that [ __ ] but still it would be

1150
00:38:32,719 --> 00:38:37,838
a good idea to have a binder with an

1151
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:40,559
msds log for all of your products that's

1152
00:38:37,838 --> 00:38:42,320
simply find every product you've got and

1153
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:44,639
go to the internet go to the website

1154
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:46,320
type in whatever product um i'm just

1155
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:47,679
gonna i don't have any liquid products

1156
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:50,400
near me i've got i can see a bottle of

1157
00:38:47,679 --> 00:38:52,559
cease so cease biological pesticide or

1158
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:55,519
fungicide whatever it says on there uh

1159
00:38:52,559 --> 00:38:57,679
seize product msds sheet and you'll find

1160
00:38:55,519 --> 00:39:00,079
it every product has an msds sheet

1161
00:38:57,679 --> 00:39:01,759
available they have to print it uh i

1162
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:03,359
make i buy these little it's like a

1163
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,359
little laminate folder that you'd keep

1164
00:39:03,358 --> 00:39:06,639
like for a presentation and a folder and

1165
00:39:05,358 --> 00:39:08,480
i just print them off and i slide them

1166
00:39:06,639 --> 00:39:10,400
all into there and make a notebook out

1167
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:12,719
of them that way if anything does go

1168
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:14,639
wrong if i do end up sick if i do ingest

1169
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:16,319
something i can grab that folder i can

1170
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:17,679
grab my pesticide log and i can go to

1171
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,760
the hospital i can say there's probably

1172
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:21,598
clues in here and then they can help me

1173
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:23,599
out or maybe somebody can take that [ __ ]

1174
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:25,838
for me if i'm not able to do it

1175
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:28,160
just good ideas to protect yourself

1176
00:39:25,838 --> 00:39:29,838
that may be a different strategy if you

1177
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:31,759
were in what is known as a red state

1178
00:39:29,838 --> 00:39:33,838
maybe you don't that's all evidence at

1179
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:36,320
this point in a red state so be careful

1180
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:39,199
with that decision but i do like to have

1181
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:40,800
uh the msds sheets a spray log try to

1182
00:39:39,199 --> 00:39:42,480
have all that stuff available in case

1183
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,839
you never know what could go wrong and i

1184
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:46,079
was trained by the department of

1185
00:39:43,838 --> 00:39:47,599
agriculture the colorado department of

1186
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:49,839
agriculture to keep those types of

1187
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:51,440
records in a commercial environment it's

1188
00:39:49,838 --> 00:39:55,039
required you have to have all that stuff

1189
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:57,119
for i think uh three to five years it

1190
00:39:55,039 --> 00:39:58,719
all has to be kept on file uh the

1191
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:01,119
compliance officer knows how many years

1192
00:39:58,719 --> 00:40:03,519
she keeps it all for us but shout out to

1193
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:05,920
your compliance officer wherever you are

1194
00:40:03,519 --> 00:40:07,358
i am super off topic now where are we

1195
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:10,000
keep those books keep all that stuff

1196
00:40:07,358 --> 00:40:11,519
documented and then uh i was saying i'm

1197
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,920
uh trained by the department of

1198
00:40:11,519 --> 00:40:16,400
agriculture i guess maybe it would be a

1199
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:18,000
good time to drop my credentials in here

1200
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:20,000
since i'm talking about pesticides

1201
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,358
applications all this safety and stuff

1202
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,920
you're going well who the hell are you

1203
00:40:21,358 --> 00:40:26,078
bro uh that's a good question i have got

1204
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:28,159
a training from the colorado department

1205
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:31,039
of agriculture and the colorado state

1206
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:33,279
university i was trained by a very great

1207
00:40:31,039 --> 00:40:35,440
lady named theo walker i took like a

1208
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:37,839
it's either a six or eight hour class in

1209
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:39,679
a cool building in denver with uh there

1210
00:40:37,838 --> 00:40:41,759
were very few people in that class but

1211
00:40:39,679 --> 00:40:44,559
it was a good time and she taught us in

1212
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:47,599
great detail about pesticides pesticide

1213
00:40:44,559 --> 00:40:50,239
handling pesticide application pesticide

1214
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:52,960
exposure she taught us a great class i

1215
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:55,118
am what is called train the trainer

and the state of colorado and i can

1218
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:02,079
teach them how to be pesticide compliant

1219
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:05,359
i can train other people to train the

1220
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:06,800
staff how to be pesticide compliant so

1221
00:41:05,358 --> 00:41:08,719
that is my credential i'm train the

1222
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:11,039
trainer certified which means i can

1223
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:13,118
train other trainers i go to the grow

1224
00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:14,880
and i train the lead grower and he

1225
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:16,800
teaches the staff or i just do a big

1226
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:18,640
meeting teach the whole class all at one

1227
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,720
time teach up the whole uh the whole

1228
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:21,838
gang so those are my credentials i do

1229
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:23,679
have a little bit of training with

1230
00:41:21,838 --> 00:41:25,759
pesticides pesticide application

1231
00:41:23,679 --> 00:41:28,960
handling and safety i'm not just talking

1232
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:31,599
out of my ass on this episode the others

1233
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:33,039
use your best judgment um

1234
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:35,119
all right where am i i've got a lot of

1235
00:41:33,039 --> 00:41:36,480
notes here i try to just freestyle

1236
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:37,920
because it feels better i feel like i'm

1237
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,358
getting a good flow the notes make me

1238
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,960
feel too robotic

1239
00:41:39,358 --> 00:41:44,078
uh spray properly do you need to spray

1240
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:46,720
the top the bottom uh run off or not

1241
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:49,599
then the next part is soil drench a lot

1242
00:41:46,719 --> 00:41:51,199
of our pests live on the leaves and hang

1243
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:53,119
out in the plants but a lot of them

1244
00:41:51,199 --> 00:41:54,799
retreat to the soil

1245
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:56,079
for safety we can shake the plants we

1246
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,519
can disrupt things they just go hide

1247
00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:00,160
down in the dirt because a lot of things

1248
00:41:57,519 --> 00:42:01,519
can't get to them so for those pests

1249
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:04,559
that's when i would recommend what is

1250
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:06,079
known as a soil dredge or a soil drench

1251
00:42:04,559 --> 00:42:08,480
there are many great products you can

1252
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:10,800
use to get rid of many common pests in

1253
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:13,119
your soil most commonly you're going to

1254
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:15,680
find uh fungus gnats in your soil you

1255
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:19,680
may find root aphids in your soil those

1256
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:20,719
are all easy to defeat with a root

1257
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:23,199
drench

1258
00:42:20,719 --> 00:42:25,598
a root drench or a spray any kind of

1259
00:42:23,199 --> 00:42:29,039
pesticide treatment needs to be done on

1260
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:30,880
a good solid schedule i spray in a

1261
00:42:29,039 --> 00:42:33,679
commercial environment if we don't have

1262
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:36,160
any issues i spray every monday if i see

1263
00:42:33,679 --> 00:42:38,799
one sign of issues we spray every monday

1264
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:40,719
and every thursday if i see something in

1265
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:42,480
the soil we'll do a soil drench on

1266
00:42:40,719 --> 00:42:44,480
monday and then we'll do another soil

1267
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:45,679
drinch on the next monday if i feel like

1268
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:48,880
there's still an issue we'll hit the

1269
00:42:45,679 --> 00:42:50,960
soil again on thursday along with those

1270
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:52,480
sprays so we're spraying up top and

1271
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:54,960
we're soaking the soil we're really

1272
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:57,199
trying to attack from all angles with

1273
00:42:54,960 --> 00:43:00,240
multiple modes of attack so a soil

1274
00:42:57,199 --> 00:43:02,399
dredge is not a problem never be afraid

1275
00:43:00,239 --> 00:43:05,358
to soil dredge those plants if you've

1276
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:08,400
got a soil borne insect something like a

1277
00:43:05,358 --> 00:43:10,480
fungus gnat something like a root aphid

1278
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:13,680
uh really easy product to soil drench

1279
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:14,960
with is evergreen maybe 15 to 30 ml of

1280
00:43:13,679 --> 00:43:16,318
evergreen is that correct i don't want

1281
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,440
to steer you wrong that came out really

1282
00:43:16,318 --> 00:43:19,838
naturally

1283
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:22,318
15 to 30 millimeter milliliters of

1284
00:43:19,838 --> 00:43:24,239
evergreen per gallon of water a nice

1285
00:43:22,318 --> 00:43:25,440
soil dread start off with the 15 see if

1286
00:43:24,239 --> 00:43:27,838
that helps you out the plants are going

1287
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:29,838
to kind of react uh soil dredge till you

1288
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:31,599
get some runoff that should help get rid

1289
00:43:29,838 --> 00:43:32,799
of your bugs i'm going to do research

1290
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:36,000
and make sure i set the right numbers

1291
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:38,480
when i edit um so we got a soil dredge

1292
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,639
for soil borne pests if you're hitting

1293
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:42,719
the soil and you're hitting the foliage

1294
00:43:40,639 --> 00:43:44,078
and the plants and the room is right

1295
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:46,239
you're definitely going to be on the

1296
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:48,240
right path to getting rid of all of

1297
00:43:46,239 --> 00:43:50,159
those problem bugs but keep in mind if

1298
00:43:48,239 --> 00:43:52,159
you're using predators we can't go

1299
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:53,598
spraying some things we can't spray most

1300
00:43:52,159 --> 00:43:55,759
things and we definitely can't use most

1301
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:57,119
of these soil dredges they will destroy

1302
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:59,520
your predator so that's going to be some

1303
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:02,000
strategery to work on there the most

1304
00:43:59,519 --> 00:44:05,039
important part to all of this is to have

1305
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,639
a routine and a plan and a strategy if

1306
00:44:05,039 --> 00:44:08,559
you just go in there on monday and spray

1307
00:44:06,639 --> 00:44:10,559
and think i got rid of it all no you

1308
00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:12,639
didn't you killed the live bugs or you

1309
00:44:10,559 --> 00:44:14,159
killed the eggs but the opposite is

1310
00:44:12,639 --> 00:44:15,759
still there there's still a small

1311
00:44:14,159 --> 00:44:18,000
population that you missed you've got to

1312
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:20,400
be on top of it that's why i spray every

1313
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,318
monday and every thursday if i see any

1314
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:24,240
issues get in there monday with one or

1315
00:44:22,318 --> 00:44:26,400
two pesticides then get in there on

1316
00:44:24,239 --> 00:44:28,799
thursday with one or two different

1317
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:30,559
pesticides then go back monday with one

1318
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:32,640
of the products i used on monday one of

1319
00:44:30,559 --> 00:44:34,639
the products i used on thursday then on

1320
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:36,480
thursday i'll use the other two products

1321
00:44:34,639 --> 00:44:38,400
and we'll just keep rotating maybe add

1322
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:40,079
some new [ __ ]

1323
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:42,000
then i just keep rotating maybe add a

1324
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:44,318
product maybe take a product out but i

1325
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,880
really do try to attack those bugs with

1326
00:44:44,318 --> 00:44:48,719
all [ __ ] options

1327
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:50,880
all right another important part is to

1328
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:52,559
have boundaries and ethics don't spray

1329
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:54,800
[ __ ] laid into flour

1330
00:44:52,559 --> 00:44:57,279
don't spray the wrong things in flour at

1331
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:59,200
all don't spray [ __ ] that you would not

1332
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:00,720
admit spraying if you wouldn't write it

1333
00:44:59,199 --> 00:45:02,318
down and say hey i sprayed 30

1334
00:45:00,719 --> 00:45:03,679
millimeters of this

1335
00:45:02,318 --> 00:45:05,759
milliliters sorry i keep saying

1336
00:45:03,679 --> 00:45:07,598
millimeters for some reason uh if you're

1337
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:09,520
not proud of it if you wouldn't admit it

1338
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:11,039
if you wouldn't smoke it with me don't

1339
00:45:09,519 --> 00:45:13,039
[ __ ] spray it on your plants that is

1340
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:16,159
really the ethics of all of it if you

1341
00:45:13,039 --> 00:45:17,440
wouldn't smoke it please don't spray it

1342
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:19,598
if you wouldn't tell us about it and be

1343
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:20,480
honest about it just don't do it you

1344
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:21,838
know

1345
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:24,240
you know and you got to feel it imagine

1346
00:45:21,838 --> 00:45:25,679
if you spray some [ __ ] on your plants

1347
00:45:24,239 --> 00:45:27,199
and you sell it to me or give it to me

1348
00:45:25,679 --> 00:45:28,480
because you you're like bro thank you

1349
00:45:27,199 --> 00:45:30,960
for the lessons and you give me an ounce

1350
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:32,880
of weed and i smoke it and like i start

1351
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:34,559
going man my lungs feel weird and like

1352
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:35,920
two weeks later i'm like my lung is all

1353
00:45:34,559 --> 00:45:37,279
burning and like a week later i'm like i

1354
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:39,358
gotta go to the hospital my lung is

1355
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:40,880
[ __ ] on fire and four weeks later

1356
00:45:39,358 --> 00:45:42,239
like i had to pull my right lung out

1357
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:44,079
because i got some disease from a

1358
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:45,679
pesticide and you're like oh that could

1359
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:47,119
have been from the [ __ ] that i sold him

1360
00:45:45,679 --> 00:45:49,118
like imagine how you're going to feel i

1361
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:50,559
don't want anybody to feel that way so

1362
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:52,318
use some ethics when it comes to the

1363
00:45:50,559 --> 00:45:54,400
pesticides and things you were spraying

1364
00:45:52,318 --> 00:45:55,920
onto your plants any sort of foliar

1365
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:57,358
product anything you're feeding your

1366
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:59,519
plants anything you're doing should be

1367
00:45:57,358 --> 00:46:01,519
treated with all of that sort of ethics

1368
00:45:59,519 --> 00:46:03,519
what would rasta jeff do think about

1369
00:46:01,519 --> 00:46:05,358
that as you're doing [ __ ] in your garden

1370

00:46:21,519 --> 00:46:24,800
again for listening to another episode

1380
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:26,559
of the grow from your heart podcast i do

1381
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:27,839
want to stress that the most important

1382
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:29,358
part of this is that you read the

1383
00:46:27,838 --> 00:46:32,078
bottles and use all of the personal

1384
00:46:29,358 --> 00:46:34,078
protective equipment and do understand

1385
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:35,200
those re-entry intervals something i

1386
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:37,280
should add i didn't mention on the

1387
00:46:35,199 --> 00:46:39,118
re-entry interval part those products

1388
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:40,960
are meant to be sprayed outdoors all of

1389
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:43,119
those products the re-entry interval

1390
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:45,679
written on those bottles is for outdoors

1391
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:47,119
add two to four hours if you were in an

1392
00:46:45,679 --> 00:46:49,358
indoor environment i know that sounds

1393
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:51,280
crazy but they're used to having wind

1394
00:46:49,358 --> 00:46:53,679
and sun to break down those products you

1395
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:56,400
don't have that in your indoor grow so i

1396
00:46:53,679 --> 00:46:59,598
would add two to four hours to your

1397
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:01,920
re-entry interval for your sprayed

1398
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:03,680
applications all right i think that is

1399
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:05,519
all i've got for you really i hope you
