bunch of stuff in the room but yesterday

86
00:02:57,509 --> 00:03:02,549
the male plants are huge there are male

87
00:03:00,629 --> 00:03:04,620
colas the length of my arms on these

88
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:05,969
male plants and they're just pollen is

89
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:07,469
just falling out if you breathe too

90
00:03:05,969 --> 00:03:08,519
heavily pollen goes flying across the

91
00:03:07,469 --> 00:03:10,469
room so I didn't want to drag the whole

92
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:12,209
plant across the room to where the

93
00:03:10,469 --> 00:03:14,340
females were so I cut off a few select

94
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:15,959
branches that were quite large carried

95
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:18,180
them over to the male plant the female

96
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:20,400
plants and gave all those male plants a

97
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:22,500
nice shake there was a huge cloud of

98
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,959
pollen in my grow room for quite a while

99
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,250
I tastes like pollen everything tastes

100
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,439
like pollen around me my whole mouth was

101
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:29,969
just coated in pollen I had to take a

102
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:31,799
fat shower I had to clean everything up

103
00:03:29,969 --> 00:03:34,289
there was a lot of pollen in the air so

104
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:36,299
in about 50-60 ish days we're gonna have

105
00:03:34,289 --> 00:03:37,949

109
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:45,120

110
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:46,500

111
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,489
forget to talk about chitin I talked

112
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,099
about [ __ ] that doesn't even matter

113
00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:52,319
instead um let's see what did I do I

114
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:55,169
kinda want to brag a couple of days ago

115
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:57,180
on Friday night I got to take my lovely

116
00:03:55,169 --> 00:03:59,608
date Jenny Beth to comedy works to go

117
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:01,140
see Joe Rogan was the headliner there

118
00:03:59,609 --> 00:04:02,730
was a comedian named Doron Horton that

119
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:04,439
opened that dude was [ __ ] hilarious

120
00:04:02,729 --> 00:04:06,599
you guys I'd never heard of or seen him

121
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:08,340
before when he came on stage he walked

122
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:11,250
in made a presence and he crushed for

123
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:12,569
like 30 or 40 solid minutes and then he

124
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:13,829
wound down and he looked at the crowd

125
00:04:12,569 --> 00:04:15,090
and he was like I think I'm done

126
00:04:13,829 --> 00:04:18,660
and he said ladies and gentlemen Joe

127
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:20,848
Rogan and Joe Rogan came out and crushed

128
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:22,380
you guys Joe Rogan just did his new

129
00:04:20,848 --> 00:04:24,658
comedy special for the year and when a

130
00:04:22,379 --> 00:04:25,860
comedian records their special the way

131
00:04:24,658 --> 00:04:26,399
they do it they kind of record that

132
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,080
special

133
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:30,089
and they throw away that material once

134
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:31,709
your comedy special comes out on Comedy

135
00:04:30,089 --> 00:04:34,019
Central or Netflix or wherever it goes

136
00:04:31,709 --> 00:04:35,339
see so seems to be the new [ __ ] once

137
00:04:34,019 --> 00:04:36,750
your comedy special comes out you throw

138
00:04:35,339 --> 00:04:38,909
away that material you don't perform

139
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:40,918
that anymore and you work on your next

140
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:42,750
hour and then at the end of the year you

141
00:04:40,918 --> 00:04:44,430
want to put out your whole new special

142
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:46,379
of our material then you do that all

143
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:47,910
over again and that keeps the commedia

144
00:04:46,379 --> 00:04:49,978
on his toes but Rogan just put out a

145
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:52,410
special so he's only had a couple of

146
00:04:49,978 --> 00:04:54,449
months to work up new [ __ ] maybe a month

147
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:56,430
and he was here doing new [ __ ] he went

148
00:04:54,449 --> 00:04:57,780
for an hour and a half and about 45 to

149
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:59,100
an hour into the show he kind of looked

150
00:04:57,779 --> 00:05:01,019
up at the crowd with this look and he

151
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:02,220
goes I just ran out of [ __ ] about like

152
00:05:01,019 --> 00:05:03,629
three minutes ago I don't have any more

153
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:05,310
material and he just started making [ __ ]

154
00:05:03,629 --> 00:05:06,870
up on the fly and kind of joke in and

155
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:09,780
he's still crushed it he did a little

156
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:11,788
bit of crowd work but he destroyed for a

157
00:05:09,779 --> 00:05:13,168
comedian I love Joe Rogan style I love

158
00:05:11,788 --> 00:05:15,629
the way he does comedy and I agree with

159
00:05:13,168 --> 00:05:17,759
like 97% of what he says so that's

160
00:05:15,629 --> 00:05:18,990
always a great show so Joe does his show

161
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:22,949
he wraps up we're giving him a standing

162
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:25,019
ovation he walks off the stage and less

163
00:05:22,949 --> 00:05:27,300
than 40 seconds later he comes running

164

I've got some friends at Comedy Works I

180
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,259
happened to be front row and as you walk

181
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:03,090
out onto the stage there are a couple

182
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:04,699
stages a couple seats actually on the

183
00:06:03,089 --> 00:06:06,899
stage but then if you go a few more feet

184
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:09,090
those next two seats that are in the

185
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:11,638
crowd are where I was sitting and where

186
00:06:09,089 --> 00:06:12,959
Jenny Beth was sitting so Chappelle just

187
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:14,759
was [ __ ] up so he just walked out

188
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:16,649
barely onto the stage so he was on the

189
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:18,719
stage and he stood directly in front of

190
00:06:16,649 --> 00:06:20,819
her and I and told jokes for about 30

191
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,880
minutes and Shane smoked cigarettes and

192
00:06:20,819 --> 00:06:26,038
drank corona beers he did 40 solid

193
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:27,538

351
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:15,550
happen through editing all right I feel

352
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,780
like that's a little bit better of

353
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:18,069
course it'll come back because I took

354
00:11:16,779 --> 00:11:19,870
some dabs and I ate this uh

355
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:21,310
I'm not blaming it on the banana pudding

356
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:22,419
bar but it is kind of making my throat a

357
00:11:21,309 --> 00:11:25,059
little uh it's getting minute that

358
00:11:22,419 --> 00:11:26,649
buttery thing but anyway let's get to

359
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:28,269
this email let's start it off with an

360
00:11:26,649 --> 00:11:30,579
email from a dude who said call him

361
00:11:28,269 --> 00:11:32,949
Roscoe he says hey dude it's Roscoe I

362
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:35,050
message you for advice which I got from

363
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:37,000
you from your episodes and it was great

364
00:11:35,049 --> 00:11:38,859
stuff dude keep up the good work I catch

365
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,480
up every Monday at work on your podcast

366
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:42,639
and have done so for over a year now

367
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,110
when I came across it in fact dude it

368
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:46,389
was around that time you said he'd put

369
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:48,909
money in a pot for your curse words so

370
00:11:46,389 --> 00:11:50,889
you guys a long time ago I didn't find

371
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:52,569
it very professional to use any

372
00:11:50,889 --> 00:11:54,759
profanity on my podcast and when I would

373
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:56,680
drop f-bombs in other words I would try

374
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:57,759
to throw I forgot how much money I said

375
00:11:56,679 --> 00:11:59,289
I would put in a jar and we actually

376
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:00,370
donated that to a good cause but I

377
00:11:59,289 --> 00:12:01,839
filled up a jar with a bunch of money

378
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:03,399
you guys and then somebody was like

379
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,870
that's stupid be yourself I hate it when

380
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:06,519
he tried to restrain yourself and so I

381
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:07,960
decided you're right [ __ ] it and now I

382
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:09,250
say [ __ ] on the show is it's a lot but

383
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,509
it's more of me honestly it's more

384
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:10,899
comfortable and I hate trying to censor

385
00:12:10,509 --> 00:12:13,179
myself

386
00:12:10,899 --> 00:12:15,129
it's how I I don't know maybe it's not

387
00:12:13,179 --> 00:12:17,049
professional but that's how I roll and

388
00:12:15,129 --> 00:12:20,080
it's me I'd rather be me than not to

389
00:12:17,049 --> 00:12:22,419
tell you the truth so he's continues to

390
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:24,370
say anyway safe to say due to your

391
00:12:22,419 --> 00:12:26,620
podcast and the educated guess you have

392
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:28,990
on I have successfully grown a lot of

393
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:31,509
nice bushy plants awesome I'm glad to

394
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:33,549
hear that he also says I've saved a ton

395
00:12:31,509 --> 00:12:35,230
of money thanks to you guys thanks to

396
00:12:33,549 --> 00:12:37,089
you guys seriously not buying from the

397
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:39,519
local riffraff has been a weight lifted

398
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:41,379
off of me anyway I've been thinking for

399
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:44,409
a year now about doing a podcast much

400
00:12:41,379 --> 00:12:46,570
similar to yours bar a few things but

401
00:12:44,409 --> 00:12:48,159
I've got to back up that's something I

402
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:50,080
don't think about he says that I've

403
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:52,350
saved him money and a big hassle not

404
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:55,330
having to buy from the local riffraff

405
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:56,590
I'm six foot five and 200 pounds and I

406
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:57,910
don't worry a lot when I used to have to

407
00:12:56,590 --> 00:13:01,240
go buy cannabis but I can only imagine

408
00:12:57,909 --> 00:13:03,339
if I were not this stature and I didn't

409
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:06,070
have this type of upbringing where I'm

410
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:07,450
from and I had to go into my old

411
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:09,220
neighborhood where I'm actually from the

412
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:10,480
go buy weed I could just imagine how

413
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:11,980
that would feel to be some of those

414
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,750
people in the stress that that would be

415
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:15,519
I'm sure people get robbed and beat up

416
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:17,860
and [ __ ] and get sold terrible product

417
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:19,779
that isn't even weed that's gotta suck

418
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:21,009
so I'm sure I could lift a lot of weight

419
00:13:19,779 --> 00:13:22,779
off people's shoulders if there

420
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:24,460
to grow that is I can only imagine that

421
00:13:22,779 --> 00:13:26,289
I didn't even realize that just thinking

422
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:27,730
about the the people you can avoid by

423
00:13:26,289 --> 00:13:30,069
not having to buy herb that's helpful

424
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:31,480
anyway he goes on I'm rambling today you

425
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:32,980
guys I apologize I'm gonna blame it on

426
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:37,060
the 200 milligrams Schumann bar that I

427
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:38,980
ate and the like 16 ounces of dr. pepper

428
00:13:37,059 --> 00:13:42,279
together whoa that's a combo you guys

429
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:44,320
I'd be feeling it he says I've been

430
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:46,000
thinking about doing a four I've been

431
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,010
thinking for over a year now about doing

432
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,220
a podcast much similar to you similar to

433
00:13:48,009 --> 00:13:52,960
yours bar a few things then he says I am

434
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:55,149
in the UK and there's not really a

435
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:57,009
podcast out here for the UK people and

436
00:13:55,149 --> 00:13:59,709
you have inspired me to want to be that

437
00:13:57,009 --> 00:14:01,629
podcast the law is changing slowly here

438
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:04,000
the NHS are testing it for the first

439
00:14:01,629 --> 00:14:06,250
time now and all the MPs want to advise

440
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:10,000
our new prime minister mr. May

441
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:11,950
to legalize cannabis oh that's awesome

442
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,470
there's a lot of amazing stuff in that

443
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:16,660
one paragraph I have inspired somebody

444
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:19,779
to want to create a podcast for their

445
00:14:16,659 --> 00:14:21,399
fourth in the UK for the entire UK about

446
00:14:19,779 --> 00:14:24,009
cannabis because there isn't one

447
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:25,779
that's awesome I am that I'm honored

448
00:14:24,009 --> 00:14:27,189
that I inspired somebody to do that also

449
00:14:25,779 --> 00:14:29,169
I'm glad that I inspired you to do that

450
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:31,750
but that's gonna lead me to part of my

451
00:14:29,169 --> 00:14:33,370
reply to your email it's also great that

452
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:35,230
the law is slowly changing there I know

453
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:36,730
some areas in the UK have really strict

454
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:38,769
shitty cannabis laws I'm glad that

455
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:42,009
they're easing up on that I love that

456
00:14:38,769 --> 00:14:44,529
the MPs want to advise the minister that

457
00:14:42,009 --> 00:14:46,330
they want them to legalize cannabis when

458
00:14:44,529 --> 00:14:47,740
I'm pretty sure that's the military

459
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:49,450
police I'm not sure exactly I didn't

460
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:51,519
research that but whoever when other

461
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:53,920
when other people are like hey do this

462
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:55,360
that's really helpful so this guy goes

463
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:56,860
on to say I want to educate people and

464
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,379
teach them how to grow small secret

465
00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:02,110
setups and have fun doing it UK cannabis

466
00:14:59,379 --> 00:15:03,700
news culture education chats and more if

467
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:06,310
not illegal to encourage on a podcast

468
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:08,320
you know I don't think it's illegal to

469
00:15:06,309 --> 00:15:10,000
encourage on a podcast but where you are

470
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,680
you may want to talk to a lawyer because

471
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,029
I don't know the rules in the UK that

472
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:14,199
could be completely different I've been

473
00:15:13,029 --> 00:15:16,449
told that I'm safe as long as I'm

474
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:18,700
careful and we try to be careful here on

475
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:20,350
the show so check on that yourself

476
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,730
that's the best I can say there but you

477
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:24,370
go on to say could you give me any

478
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:26,950
advice on doing this any tips tricks et

479
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:28,600
cetera to a successful successful

480
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:31,300
podcast and he said thanks dude much

481
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:32,290
love rosco and they also said PS don't

482
00:15:31,299 --> 00:15:33,759
mind if you read it on your podcast

483
00:15:32,289 --> 00:15:34,000
which is good because I just read the

484
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:36,909

487
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:42,639
inspire you to do a podcast about

488
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,500
cannabis third thanks for being so

489
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:45,699
passionate about cannabis because it

490
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,990
sounds like it's illegal there and

491
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:48,280
you're risking your life and your safety

492
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:50,139
and your family and your freedom and

493
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:51,759
your finances in your future for this

494
00:15:50,139 --> 00:15:54,039
plant because you're in love so thanks

495
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:57,279
for being on this team and that leads me

496
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:59,439
to my answer my part of my reply I know

497
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:01,059
that you're the right person to do this

498
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:04,000
podcast because you have taken the

499
00:16:01,059 --> 00:16:04,509
effort to reach out to me to say what

500
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,639
should I do

501
00:16:04,509 --> 00:16:07,840
so that tells me right there you are

502
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,850
supposed to be the guy doing this

503
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:13,420
podcast be the confident dude that you

504
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:15,340
are when you go to make your podcast

505
00:16:13,419 --> 00:16:16,539
talk to the people just like you did to

506
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:17,680
me in this email because this is

507
00:16:16,539 --> 00:16:19,509
comfortable and it sounds like you're a

508
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:21,099
cool person and it sounds like you can

509
00:16:19,509 --> 00:16:23,679
connect with people so do that on your

510
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:25,810
podcast just be yourself that's the best

511
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:29,049
advice I can give to any person trying

512
00:16:25,809 --> 00:16:30,699
to do any podcast be you if your fake

513
00:16:29,049 --> 00:16:32,259
your listeners won't know it you won't

514
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:34,330
have any fun it won't feel good and

515
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:36,250
you'll come across fake and people can

516
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:37,750
spot fake and they won't listen to fake

517
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:39,730
and you'll get more shitty emails than

518
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:43,419
you could ever imagine so chill out be

519
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:45,700
yourself edit a little bit but don't

520
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:47,860
take out all of your mistakes I I

521
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:49,450
stutter I say dumb [ __ ] I say the wrong

522
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:51,370
[ __ ] and I talked over myself all the

523
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:53,410
time but that's me and I've learned to

524
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:55,179
accept me and it makes a good podcast

525
00:16:53,409 --> 00:16:57,100
just being me people don't want me to be

526
00:16:55,179 --> 00:16:58,689
a Paula I'm not the president I don't

527
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:00,550
need to come out you out here up here

528
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:01,990
and speak some perfect [ __ ] to you do

529
00:17:00,549 --> 00:17:04,389
you have to grow weed so be yourself be

530
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:06,549
comfortable get some good equipment

531
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:08,530
that's something I really should say you

532
00:17:06,549 --> 00:17:10,930
don't need to spend a lot of money my

533
00:17:08,529 --> 00:17:13,599
favorite set up is the zoom h6 on-the-go

534
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:17,350
I use a zoom h6 and I run four

535
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:18,669
Sennheiser 835 ee 835 microphones into

536
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:20,438
that I'm not sure what's available in

537
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:22,660
the UK you could probably get that or

538
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:25,810
very similar it's a great recording

539
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:27,189
device a lot of people use that for my

540
00:17:25,809 --> 00:17:29,950
big setup there's a lot of stuff

541
00:17:27,189 --> 00:17:32,110
happening but sound quality is certainly

542
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:34,360
important people if when people do phone

543
00:17:32,109 --> 00:17:37,719
calls on a podcast or if they Skype in I

544
00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:39,459
don't even listen so get good quality so

545
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:42,160
I'd really stress on good quality sound

546
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:43,690
good sound the best you can make sure

547
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,890
that there's no funky noise in the

548
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:46,390
background or if you're gonna do in a

549
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:47,320
coffee shop and you want that clunky

550
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:49,450
like dishes

551
00:17:47,319 --> 00:17:50,528
waitress sound vibe kind of thing go for

552
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:52,450
that if that's your vibe I don't like

553
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:53,798
that I like it quiet I talk when I don't

554
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:55,929
talk there's no noise in my background I

555
00:17:53,798 --> 00:17:57,429
love that sort of feel so sound how you

556
00:17:55,929 --> 00:17:59,288
want to sound achieve your sound figure

557
00:17:57,429 --> 00:18:02,889
out how you got to do that be yourself

558
00:17:59,288 --> 00:18:04,509
and then find content that relates to

559
00:18:02,888 --> 00:18:07,148
the audience you want to hit which is

560
00:18:04,509 --> 00:18:09,159
obviously cannabis and news and culture

561
00:18:07,148 --> 00:18:11,109
and education and chats so find some

562
00:18:09,159 --> 00:18:12,309
people in your community that you can

563
00:18:11,109 --> 00:18:14,168
get on a show and build a relationship

564
00:18:12,308 --> 00:18:16,928
with what I found is the people that

565
00:18:14,169 --> 00:18:18,519
come back to my show the third and

566
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,840
fourth time they come back they forget

567
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:21,970
they're on a podcast and they're now

568
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:23,230
hanging out in my little recording space

569
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:25,058
and we just happen to have headphones

570
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:27,308
and a microphone on and we really get

571
00:18:25,058 --> 00:18:29,589
talking about cannabis in a way that we

572
00:18:27,308 --> 00:18:31,509
love instead of a way that feels podcast

573
00:18:29,589 --> 00:18:33,220
II and interviewee like you guys notice

574
00:18:31,509 --> 00:18:34,450

576
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:40,179
episodes Jesse talked like this like

577
00:18:36,609 --> 00:18:41,408
said like four words like okay yeah and

578
00:18:40,179 --> 00:18:44,019

580
00:18:44,019 --> 00:18:46,899

582
00:18:46,898 --> 00:18:50,859

583
00:18:48,579 --> 00:18:54,398
areas of cannabis like I've got a guy

596
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:19,778
from being a podcast nerd if you want to

597

598
00:19:19,778 --> 00:19:24,579
10 episodes put together before you

599
00:19:21,788 --> 00:19:26,349

600
00:19:24,579 --> 00:19:28,480
eight weeks in iTunes is when they will

601
00:19:26,349 --> 00:19:30,459

602
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,620
ratings and you pop out with a lot of

603
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:34,298
quality content iTunes will put you in

604
00:19:32,619 --> 00:19:37,508

608

00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:00,429
the UK some of the setup may be

648
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:01,539
different but we'll get it going we'll

649
00:21:00,429 --> 00:21:03,159
figure it out between the two of us

650
00:21:01,538 --> 00:21:05,230
we're smart enough to get this going I

651
00:21:03,159 --> 00:21:06,460
can't wait to hear your show and also

656
00:21:11,528 --> 00:21:15,038

670
00:21:35,589 --> 00:21:38,678
been listening for over a year now first

671
00:21:37,419 --> 00:21:40,179
I want to thank you for spreading the

672
00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:42,548
knowledge and being a voice for the

673
00:21:40,179 --> 00:21:44,440
cannabis community awesome man first off

674
00:21:42,548 --> 00:21:46,000
thanks for listening second I guess I'm

675
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:48,009
glad to be that voice for the community

676
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,630
I guess I'm just the guy that grabbed a

677
00:21:48,009 --> 00:21:51,519
mic and wanted to do that I never

678
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:52,750
thought of that trying to think about it

679
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:54,460
then it'll put too much pressure on me

680
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:55,869
anyway he goes on and he says my

681
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:58,120
question I hope you can give your

682
00:21:55,869 --> 00:21:59,619
thoughts on is a term known as bud

683
00:21:58,119 --> 00:22:01,629
washing I had a good friend telling me

684
00:21:59,619 --> 00:22:03,548
to try it in case you're unfamiliar with

685
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:05,260
the term it's where you take your just

686
00:22:03,548 --> 00:22:07,720
harvested butts that are still on the

687
00:22:05,259 --> 00:22:10,599
branches and you dip or wash them in

688
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:12,460
water I read it's supposed to get dust

689
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:15,639
particles off of your herb and make it

690
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:17,500
cleaner tastier smoke then he also says

691
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,759
turning me on to Ritchie spice I heard

692
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:21,039
you mentioning him on a previous episode

693
00:22:18,759 --> 00:22:22,990
so I searched him out and then he quotes

694
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:24,579
some Richie spice oh man you're glad all

695
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:26,019
right you're welcome I'm glad you like

696
00:22:24,579 --> 00:22:27,970
Richie spice oh you guys I'm hiya [ __ ]

697
00:22:26,019 --> 00:22:30,220
tonight this Shumate bar is kicking in I

698
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:32,500
ate this an hour and a half I should go

699
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:34,329
and yeah I'm floating around on my chair

700
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:35,769
here 200 milligrams of THC distillate

701
00:22:34,329 --> 00:22:38,049
will get to you plus I've had a few dabs

702
00:22:35,769 --> 00:22:40,389
so kind of floating around I like it I

703
00:22:38,049 --> 00:22:41,919
love it try out so I'm gonna kind of

704
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:44,080
talk about what he asked here he said is

705
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:46,360
blood washing a term that I am familiar

706
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:48,669
with yes I learned this from Jorge

707
00:22:46,359 --> 00:22:49,000
Cervantes Jorge didn't do it with just

708
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:52,420
water

709
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,130
Jorge took a five-gallon bucket of he

710
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:55,660
used reverse osmosis water you can use

711
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:57,280
water from the hose if your water is

712
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:59,410
okay if you don't have funky ass water

713
00:22:57,279 --> 00:23:01,539
you can use water from your hose so fill

714
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:04,240
up a 5-gallon bucket of water and then

715
00:23:01,539 --> 00:23:07,210
Jorge was putting 25 I've seen people

716
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:08,829
put more you guys but 25 is probably

717
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:12,370
what I would recommend 25 or 30

718
00:23:08,829 --> 00:23:15,699
milliliters of 30% hydrogen peroxide

719
00:23:12,369 --> 00:23:17,349
into a five-gallon bucket of water not

720
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:19,330
the hydrogen peroxide that your mom's

721
00:23:17,349 --> 00:23:21,399
got in the cabinet the stuff that you

722
00:23:19,329 --> 00:23:24,939
buy you can get it at the Hydra store

723
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:28,680
probably and get it online but it's 30%

724
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:31,720
maybe 33 maybe 35% hydrogen peroxide

725
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:33,940
it's not expensive but you put about 30

726
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:36,400
milliliters of that 25 30 mils in a

727
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:38,350
5-gallon bucket stir it up real good and

728
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,450
then you harvest the branches and you

729
00:23:38,349 --> 00:23:42,009
leave is like kind of long branches you

730
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:45,519
know six to eight inch long branches and

731
00:23:42,009 --> 00:23:47,890
wear rubber gloves and dunk the entire

732
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:49,299
branch into the water and give it a

733
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:51,310
swirl like freshly chopped you want to

734
00:23:49,299 --> 00:23:53,529
chop the plants down cut off all the big

735
00:23:51,309 --> 00:23:54,940
leaves trim it up like you're gonna trim

736
00:23:53,529 --> 00:23:56,589
it up again later like you're just

737
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:57,640
cleaning it up you're not manicuring it

738
00:23:56,589 --> 00:24:00,369
you're just kind of trimming it

739
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:02,470
I've been dunk that into the water

740
00:24:00,369 --> 00:24:04,089
solution the peroxide water solution

741
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:06,850
give it a good swirl so that if there is

742
00:24:04,089 --> 00:24:08,619
perhaps powdery mildew on there you can

743
00:24:06,849 --> 00:24:10,629
knock that powdery mildew off that is a

744
00:24:08,619 --> 00:24:13,119
really good way to get powdery mildew if

745
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:14,920
you don't have the PM on there I guess

746
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:16,929
that would knock dust off if you drew it

747
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:18,340
outside and it got dusty and [ __ ] but I

748
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:19,690
don't see how much it dust is really

749
00:24:18,339 --> 00:24:20,889
gonna be on your plants if you grew

750
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:22,509
indoors in a good

751
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:24,940
grow environment but I've heard of this

752
00:24:22,509 --> 00:24:27,730
being done by Jorge Cervantes and I've

753
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:29,090
seen it done by other people for powdery

754
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:31,490
mildew and other problem

755
00:24:29,089 --> 00:24:33,859
like that to clean that stuff off so

756
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:36,049
brought a little bit of peroxide 25 to

757
00:24:33,859 --> 00:24:37,939
30 mils and a five-gallon bucket to

758
00:24:36,049 --> 00:24:39,349
clean water cut the branches into six or

759
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:40,789
eight inch maybe ten inch sections it's

760
00:24:39,349 --> 00:24:42,199
got to fit in that five-gallon bucket

761
00:24:40,789 --> 00:24:44,839
dunk it in there give it a good shake

762
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:46,039
then hang it up give the buds plenty of

763
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:47,689
space when they're hung up on there that

764
00:24:46,039 --> 00:24:49,490
way and they're just gonna drip onto the

765
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:50,960
floor you guys all that water is gonna

766
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:53,480
drip all over the floor

767
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:55,250
and it is gonna run right out and then

768
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:57,079
it'll dry keep a fan in the room maybe a

769
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:59,059
dehumidifier in there pay attention to

770
00:24:57,079 --> 00:25:00,289
the conditions in your drying area but

771
00:24:59,059 --> 00:25:02,629
if you're gonna do this you got to pay

772
00:25:00,289 --> 00:25:04,220
attention I don't let it get to you to

773
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:06,110
humaid in there a lot of people are

774
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:07,759
gonna say you're gonna soak buds that

775
00:25:06,109 --> 00:25:09,229
were just harvested you guys if you

776
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:11,029
think about it cannabis plants grow

777
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:12,680
outside and if it weren't for us getting

778
00:25:11,029 --> 00:25:14,930
in the way they would get wet all the

779
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:16,549
damn time I don't think that every

780
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:18,259
cannabis plant that ever got wet outside

781
00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:19,879
got destroyed I'm pretty sure that a lot

782
00:25:18,259 --> 00:25:22,039
of them got stronger and they got

783
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:24,080
tougher if you look at the shape of a

784
00:25:22,039 --> 00:25:26,389
cannabis plant it is kind of shaped like

785
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:29,899
an umbrella when water hits a cannabis

786
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:31,730
plant the leaves pushed the water in an

787
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:34,400
outward direction and it spreads it out

788
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:35,750
so that it falls down now that tells me

789
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,220
that you should water the plants around

790
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:38,569
that area because that's where the roots

791
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:40,400
are gonna grow out because in nature

792
00:25:38,569 --> 00:25:41,329
that's where the water is gonna land of

793
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,040
course you want to get it in toward the

794
00:25:41,329 --> 00:25:44,029
stock with the outward area is a little

795
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:46,250
bit more aware you want it because

796
00:25:44,029 --> 00:25:47,599
nature would spread it out so cannabis

797
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:50,750
is gonna search for roots out that way

798
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:52,579
because it knows that you guys also the

799
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:54,049
resin glands on your plant will protect

800
00:25:52,579 --> 00:25:56,329
it from the water you're not gonna bust

801
00:25:54,049 --> 00:25:57,710
that off by just giving it a little dunk

802
00:25:56,329 --> 00:26:00,049
it's not gonna come off there these guys

803
00:25:57,710 --> 00:26:02,090
that make ash they're using a washing

804
00:26:00,049 --> 00:26:03,859
machine and ice to pull those trichomes

805
00:26:02,089 --> 00:26:06,019
off of your buds so a little bit of a

806
00:26:03,859 --> 00:26:07,189
dunk isn't gonna gonna pull those off of

807
00:26:06,019 --> 00:26:09,259
there if you've already got a little bit

808
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:10,910
of PM or if you had an issue this is a

809
00:26:09,259 --> 00:26:12,529
good way to get rid of it it's funny

810
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:14,180
because in Colorado I make the joke that

811
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:16,430
nobody gets powdery mildew anymore ever

812
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:18,529
ever since anybody infinite or figured

813
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:20,000
out how to make BHO everybody just

814
00:26:18,529 --> 00:26:22,490
[ __ ] blast it even though it's got

815
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,470
powdery mildew on it but I wouldn't

816
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:26,539
recommend using a hole if it's got a lot

817
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:27,769
of powdery mildew don't don't use it get

818
00:26:26,539 --> 00:26:29,240
rid of that product get rid of that

819
00:26:27,769 --> 00:26:30,710
material but if you've just got a little

820
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:32,210
bit of a problem like people in Oregon

821
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:33,829
this year got pummeled with powdery

822
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:35,240
mildew and other molds this will not

823
00:26:33,829 --> 00:26:36,740
handle your Brown mold this will not

824
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:38,630
handle [ __ ] like that but a little bit

825
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:39,620
of powdery mildew this peroxide solution

826
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:41,180
will get rid of it

827
00:26:39,619 --> 00:26:43,369
yes you can do it if you want to get the

828
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:46,159
dust and the dirt off if you drew out

829
00:26:43,369 --> 00:26:48,918
a lot of people find like cocoons or

830
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:50,028
caterpillars silk on their buds that

831
00:26:48,919 --> 00:26:51,500
would be a good way to get rid of that

832
00:26:50,028 --> 00:26:52,940
stuff just give it a good dunk that way

833
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:54,200
you know it's clean just make sure you

834
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:56,120
getting plenty of ventilation plenty

835
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:57,288
airflow when it dries it's gonna dry up

836
00:26:56,119 --> 00:26:59,629
like normal it's just gonna take a

837
00:26:57,288 --> 00:27:01,099
little bit longer you won't notice a

838
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:02,899
difference I'm pretty sure you can take

839
00:27:01,099 --> 00:27:04,490
a bud that did not get dunked in a bud

840
00:27:02,898 --> 00:27:06,319
that did get dunked and dried properly

841
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:08,569
and trimmed and cured properly and you

842
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:11,058
can smoke them both and you will not be

843
00:27:08,569 --> 00:27:12,500
able to tell the difference that's my

844
00:27:11,058 --> 00:27:14,599
opinion on that so yes I've heard of

845
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:16,099
this I've seen it in practice I don't

846
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:17,418
know that I have personally tried it but

847
00:27:16,099 --> 00:27:19,730
I've seen it done I've been places that

848
00:27:17,419 --> 00:27:21,259
have done it it's kind of a semi common

849
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:22,700
practice and commercial grows to tell

850
00:27:21,259 --> 00:27:25,638
you the truth because it is legal in

851
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:28,548
Colorado to do that two buds grown in a

852
00:27:25,638 --> 00:27:29,750
commercial facility all right I think

853
00:27:28,548 --> 00:27:30,980
that's all I've got time for I don't

854
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:32,089
want to start another email because I've

855
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:34,038
been going for close to thirty minutes

856
00:27:32,089 --> 00:27:35,329
and it's hard to do a long episode by

857
00:27:34,038 --> 00:27:37,519
myself I feel like I just start

858
00:27:35,329 --> 00:27:38,778
chattering get way off course so I'm

859
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:40,190
gonna start wrapping up to show you guys

860
00:27:38,778 --> 00:27:43,190

not like having their service attached

869
00:27:55,069 --> 00:28:00,200
to my website that was about a podcast

870
00:27:57,429 --> 00:28:01,460
it was about growing cannabis they felt

871
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,720
like that was inappropriate and they

872
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:04,700
didn't want to be involved so they made

873
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,860
me take the PayPal link off of my

874
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:08,990
