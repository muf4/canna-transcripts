thank you i do appreciate that i do feel

62
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:22,639
like that is most of the rambling that i

63
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,680
had written down here for the start of

64
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:25,119
the show

65
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,360
i want to talk about something that i've

66
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,680
got called evolution of a strain and

67
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,560
then we will work our way into uh some

68
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,879
grow questions here i was recently in a

69
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,560
chat and somebody asked uh kind of how

70
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:38,719
long it takes from the time i make a

71
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,159
strain until it is released they're like

72
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:41,439
man didn't you make those like a long

73
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:43,519
time ago and why are you just now

74
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:44,800
putting them out and then i thought that

75
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,480
would be a great thing to talk about

76
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,719
here on the podcast so we're going to

77
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:50,719
talk about the evolution of a strain

78
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:52,560
when i make a new cross when i get a

79
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:54,080
male plant and a female plant i do some

80
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,959
pollen chucking and those plants make

81
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:59,280
magic happen how long from the time that

82
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:01,199
cross is made until those seeds are

83
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,360
actually released to the market let's

84
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:05,679
talk about the process that uh takes the

85
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,840
steps that takes uh just the way we do

86
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,840
that here we go we're gonna jump into it

87
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,640
let's just say that i'm gonna grow or

88
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,959
maybe somebody sends me a plant or i'm

89
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:16,878
working in my garden and i realize that

90
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,959
female plant right there would work

91
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:20,799
beautifully with that male plant over

92
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,120
there just something intuitively tells

93
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,319
me that or maybe i'm smoking a plant and

94
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,560
i go

95
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:28,158
this is really good but it's missing

96
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,878
this and then i go oh well this male

97
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:32,639
plant got that let's put those together

98
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:35,039
so there's an idea there's an inception

99
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:36,719
there's so a spawned idea in my brain

100
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:38,719
i've got to get the idea so i've got the

101
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:40,158
idea now i've got to cut some clones

102
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:42,400
i've got to clean out a room i've got to

103
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:43,840
get space there could be at this time

104
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,599
who knows i may have just put a room

105
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,200
into flower it could be 70 days before i

106
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:49,280
could [ __ ] do this project or i could

107
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:50,798
get it going right away so i've got the

108
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,039
idea in my head now i've got to get the

109
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:55,599
idea on paper i'm going to write this

110
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:57,598
down i want to breed plant a to plant b

111
00:03:55,598 --> 00:03:59,679
and my goal is going to be to improve

112
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:01,119
the part of this plant that sucks kind

113
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,480
of get this straight from this plant

114
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,920
this is what i'm hoping for so i'm going

115
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:06,000
to write that down then i will cut a

116
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:09,359
bunch of clones the appropriate clones

117
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,799
to breed this project about female a and

118
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,040
male a and we're going to cut those

119
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,400
plants then i'm going to veg them then

120
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:15,679
we're going to put them in the flower

121
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,759
room then of course there will be some

122
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,199
pollen chuck and then six to eight weeks

123
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,120
later we'll have seeds and it takes

124
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,199
about a week for them to dry pull the

125
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,360
seeds out separate them get them all

126
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,960
packaged up from the time i start

127
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,759
cutting those clones to the time i

128
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:32,959
actually have usable packageable seeds

129
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:35,919
in my hands is probably somewhere around

130
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:38,079
16 to 20-ish weeks depending on how

131
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:39,519
large i want those plants to get

132
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:41,039
depending on how much space i've got

133
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:43,519
depending on which strains i'm working

134
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,120
with some veg much more quickly some

135
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:47,439
don't veg as rapidly so they've got to

136
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,840
go another week but it could be up to 20

137
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:52,240
weeks from the time i cut the clones

138
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:54,478
till i have the first seeds in my hand

139
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,478
ready to put into packages then from

140
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:58,159
there there's a lot of work to do so

141
00:04:56,478 --> 00:05:00,079
let's just say i got the idea i wrote

142
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,600
down the goal i put the male plant the

143
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:04,000
female plant the room at the right time

144
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,759
they did their magic uh we let the seeds

145
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,519
harden up uh the seeds have been

146
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,960
harvested they get the plants get are

147
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:11,198
the plants get harvested they get cut

148
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:12,799
down the plants dry pull the seeds out

149
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,319
separate them it's been 20 weeks now

150
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,840
let's talk about the other steps that it

151
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:18,319
takes this is where the work really

152
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:21,038
begins before i can start releasing this

153
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:23,759
product we put 20 weeks into the grow

154
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:25,839
now i've got to harvest it package it up

155
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,360
and do some testing this is when i start

156
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:29,119
growing the seeds

157
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,479
it's been 20 weeks already and i don't

158
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,759
even know what i've made yet i'm going

159
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:33,120
to grow these seeds i'm going to veg

160
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,800
them out for just a couple of weeks

161
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,439
they're going to be really little on my

162
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,439
first run my tester plants are tiny they

163
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:41,759
go in a one gallon pot they veg till

164
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:43,600
they're about eight or nine inches tall

165
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,759
and then i flip them and then i take a

166
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,520
lot of pictures and a lot of notes so

167
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,960
the first step the first step is to make

168
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:51,038
the seeds we already established that's

169
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:52,560
about a 20 week process then i'm going

170
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:54,478
to grow them i'm going to veg for two

171
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,720
weeks then i'm going to flower for 10

172
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:58,719
weeks we're already up to approximately

173
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,560
a 30 week process and all i've done is

174
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,280
test the seeds myself nobody else has

175
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,759
even grown these yet so once i grow them

176
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:08,079
if i approve then i package up testers

177
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:10,319
and i go recruiting the test team to get

178
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:11,839
some seeds going for me now they're

179
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,919
going to take a week or two to get the

180
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:15,599
seeds then they're going to take two to

181
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:18,079
four weeks to veg though some guys go

182
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,840
even longer so we're looking at 40 weeks

183
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:21,680
already then they've got nine to ten

184
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:24,000
more weeks of flowering that's 50 weeks

185
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,918
you guys we're at nearly a year two more

186
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,759
weeks is a full year

187
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:29,599
so that is several weeks of work before

188
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,919
we even really get to put a seed out to

189
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,600
market i've got to make it then i've got

190
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:36,639
to test it i've got to send it out to

191
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,400
the testers now it's oftentimes when i

192
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,560
see that the testers are having success

193
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:42,159
with these seeds i will add them as

194
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,560
freebies to orders if you're getting

195
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,880
seeds off of ire direct then you will

196
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,959
get some brand new [ __ ] as freebies

197
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:50,800
those are testers instead of just

198
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:52,638
putting them out as test seeds i also

199
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,000
give them that give them away they're

200
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,519
labeled on the package that they're

201
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,120
testers that i don't know what they're

202
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:59,359
going to do yet i make it clear this is

203
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,598
a freebie tester but here you go have

204
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,439
fun with it what then happens after i

205
00:07:01,598 --> 00:07:05,279
give those testers away a lot of those

206
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:07,120
people will grow those before they even

207
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:08,638
grow the seeds they paid for because

208
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,240
they got some brand new exciting [ __ ]

209
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,560
they weren't expecting they're gonna

210
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,160
grow that then i get even more feedback

211
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,319
because now i've got the feedback i got

212
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,160
from the crop i grew i get feedback from

213
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,639
my testers now i get feedback from the

214
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,960
people that are growing it as freebies

215
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,400
so i test it the group tests it then it

216
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:26,239
goes out as freebies now i'm getting a

217
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:27,839
bunch of photos i'm getting a bunch of

218
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,840
data and a bunch of feedback and we know

219
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:31,519
what we've really got at this point if

220
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:33,119
it's gotten this far i know it's going

221
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:35,120
to make it it won't get this far if it's

222
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,560
not going to make it if if i didn't like

223
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,840
it if the testers didn't approve of it

224
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,680
if there were problems it just got

225
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:41,198
scrapped it got put on the back burner

226
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,639
it got forgotten about those seeds are

227
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,840
probably flushed down the toilet or in a

228
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:47,680
compost bin or fed to the birds so

229
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:49,038
once we once i see enough people growing

230
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,800
and i've got pictures and photos and

231
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:52,240
data then i can start hyping it up i

232
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,560
know it's going to come out for an

233
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:57,120
official release what i may do at this

234
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,360
point is do kind of a pre-release on my

235
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,079
website or another website a lot of

236
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:04,560
times i will pick one vendor and i will

237
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:06,560
do an exclusive drop with that one

238
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,000
vendor a lot of times it is seeds here

239
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,160
now because that's my preferred

240
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,560
exclusive vendor but sometimes i will

241
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,479
rotate it around to where vendor a is

242
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,000
going to get these packs on this day and

243
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:17,680
then vendor b is going to get these

244
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,839
packs on this day that way i don't

245
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,598
overload one vendor everybody gets to

246
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:22,799
play somebody gets to everybody gets to

247
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:24,478
eat the money gets spread around the

248
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,000
business gets moved around i like to

249
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:27,839
support all of the vendors because they

250
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,199
do support me and they support you the

251
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:31,839
consumer

252
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:34,158
so at this point we have gone from me

253
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:36,478
making seeds me testing seeds the test

254
00:08:34,158 --> 00:08:38,559
crew testing out seeds the freebies

255
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,680
going out now they are going to a

256
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:43,439
pre-drop at one vendor or on my website

257
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,559
we'll just put out a few of them we'll

258
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,560
let them go we'll see what the

259
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:48,159
excitement is like what the hype is like

260
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:50,159
get a count of how many sell and how

261
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:52,480
quickly then that lets me prepare for

262
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:53,679
the official drop where i will call up

263
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,680
all the vendors and say hey i got this

264
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:57,120
many packs how many do you want they'll

265
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:59,199
claim their packs i'll send it out to

266
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,959
them and we will all agree that at five

267
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,640
o'clock on this day they are going on

268
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:04,879
sale we'll all drop them on our websites

269
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:09,120
all at the same time sometimes that

270
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:10,639
process is over one full year many of

271
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,959
the seeds that you guys see me putting

272
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:14,720
out on the websites right now the seeds

273
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:18,479
that are dropping on i redirect were

274
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:20,879
made a solid year maybe 18 months ago

275
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,639
you'll notice the inspector royale

276
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:24,559
it is on the website on the iredirect

277
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:27,199
website right now it will make a huge

278
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:29,359
debut at the dgc growers cup i will have

279
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,680
plenty there that one was made in a

280
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:34,240
greenhouse approximately a year ago

281
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:36,079
those seeds were made uh we put plants

282
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,240
outdoors already in that greenhouse

283
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:41,040
again and i am just now dropping those

284
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,278
seeds so that that is what goes into

285
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:44,799
testing and ensuring that a seed is a

286
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:46,639
quality product i don't just make some

287
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:48,799
seeds and throw them out there i've got

288
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:50,319
these seeds sitting around being tested

289
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:51,759
they're in storage they're in a jar

290
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,440
they're in a vault they're being saved

291
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:55,439
and preserved for up to a year before

292
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,600
you guys get to get them because i want

293
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,040
to make sure it is a quality product

294
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,720
oftentimes

295
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:02,799
i'll make a small batch of these seeds

296
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,639
and we'll test those and once i realize

297
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:06,639
if it's a real big hit then i'll go back

298
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:08,319
and make a lot more sometimes that's

299
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:09,600
really time consuming i try to bang it

300
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,839
out on the first run so we could keep

301
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,759
moving forward remake stuff that really

302
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,800
sells well and move past the [ __ ] that

303
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:18,958
doesn't but that is the inception of a

304
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:21,039
seed sometimes from the time i think

305
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:23,919
about it to the time you get your first

306
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:25,919
batch of seeds is up to a solid year so

307
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:28,159
be patient with me be understanding

308
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:30,559
there's a lot of work to be done also as

309
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:32,480
a consumer as a buyer as a customer as a

310
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:34,559
grower you should be excited that i'm

311
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,800
spending a solid year doing research and

312
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:39,039
development on one package of seed so

313
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:40,479
that you don't get intersex plants dud

314
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:42,480
plants i really put a lot of care into

315
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,839
this is what i'm trying to say all right

316
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,920
that's what i wanted to talk about the

317
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,680
inception and evolution of a strain oh

318
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:49,838
there's one more part

319
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:51,278
before i will release a strain and this

320
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,360
was really frustrating shout out to my

321
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:54,639
buddy fiskell uh fiscal wanted to buy

322
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,480
some seeds off of me he's like you've

323
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:57,679
got that cross and i was like yeah but i

324
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,360
got a lot of them and he's like sell it

325
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:01,359
to me and i said i can't sell it until

326
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,120
i've got a name for it

327
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,959
he was throwing out names every day i

328
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,799
would get a list of names eventually

329
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:08,719
that one did become fist bump that's

330
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:10,879
available check out the fist bump on

331
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,560
irie direct all right that is all i've

332
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:14,639
got for the evolution of a strain let's

333
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:16,799
work our way into these emails that i

334
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:18,559
was talking about i've got a great email

335
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:21,439
right here in front of me this one comes

336
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:23,838
from my friend petepan007

337
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,079
and it goes a little bit like this it

338
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:28,160
says question maybe for the podcast this

339
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:29,919
is a good one bro it says a lot of

340
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:32,559
people are going on vacation right now

341
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:35,759
and harvest time always seems to fall on

342
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:36,958
one week you leave for vacay and then he

343
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:38,639
says the thing that i was going to say

344
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:40,958
right after that i need to plan better

345
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:42,559
yes uh you plan to the grow and the

346
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:45,119
vacation i bet your wife planned the

347
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:46,719
vacation i know how that [ __ ] goes but

348
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,320
you do need to plan better everyone's

349
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,160
got a calendar and a schedule and we got

350
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,879
alexa and siri to tell us when we [ __ ]

351
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:52,559
up

352
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:55,120
but planning is key right there but it

353
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:56,879
says my question is would you harvest

354
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,120
when things are looking super close at

355
00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:00,879
about a week nine or would you wait and

356
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,799
cut them down when you get home thank

357

366
00:12:20,078 --> 00:12:24,239
let's talk about this it's summertime

367
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,320
people are going on vacation people are

368
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,440
traveling around i'm guilty i've been

369
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,680
all over the place i haven't left

370
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,279
colorado but i've been to every freaking

371
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:32,799
border of colorado in the past couple of

372
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:34,879
weeks here it's been no complaints it's

373
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:37,439
been great but it's time consuming it's

374
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:38,879
exhausting and the garden does almost

375
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,399
suffer at times because i'll catch

376
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:41,759
myself driving home going [ __ ] i hope

377
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,519
the plants are okay i hope the plants

378
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:45,039
are okay and they are but it's a little

379
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,120
nerve-wracking so

380
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:48,879
if you're gonna go on vacation

381
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,200
it will be less nerve-wracking if you

382
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:53,278
cut before you go but the plants will do

383
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,399
you better if you wait until you get

384
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:56,480
back

385
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,240
don't cut them until you get back

386
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,320
when in doubt always just give them that

387
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,839
extra week 10 days let them grow longer

388
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,160
you're gonna have better buds if you go

389
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:06,320
longer you'll have more bud better bud

390
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:08,639
more dense bud more flavor more potent

391
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,560
more potency so just wait i would cut

392
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,240
them down after the vacation go have a

393
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:13,599
good time go enjoy your trip go enjoy

394
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,360
the time with the family or whatever

395
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,800
you're doing and then when you get back

396
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,720
you've got something really cool to look

397
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:20,958
forward to you don't want to cut it down

398
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,320
right before you leave anyway because

399
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:24,078
then it's just going to hang there your

400
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,278
whole trip it may get too dry it may get

401
00:13:24,078 --> 00:13:27,199
too crispy

402
00:13:25,278 --> 00:13:29,360
you may need to do some adjustments you

403
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,200
can't burp it you can't put it in jars i

404
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,039
would wait till i get back

405
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,639
as for watering while you're gone i

406
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:36,159
would just soak them real hard right

407
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,159
before you go unless you've got a buddy

408
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:39,519
or a grow helper which i really i don't

409
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:40,159
like that most of the time they always

410
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,000
end

411
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:44,078
i hear more stories about the grow

412
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,159
helper [ __ ] up than helping all the

413
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:48,479
time but uh just water them real hard

414
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:49,838
before you go and then just let them

415
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,600
ride it out until you come back and

416
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:53,279
maybe you'll have some some buds that

417
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,120
are already drying on the stick for you

418
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:57,360
getting a little pre-harvest going but

419
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:00,399
my advice is always let them go a little

420
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,000
bit longer don't do them too early ever

421
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:03,360
unless that is absolutely what you got

422
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,278
to do and i hope you learned your lesson

423
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,680
bro plan ahead next time so you're not

424
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:08,958
on vacation during the harvest all right

425
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:10,638
thank you for the great message all

426
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:13,119
right the next question here comes from

427
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:14,799
my buddy alabama man big shout out to my

428
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,720
buddy alabama man thank you for all of

429
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:19,359
the support this is a good question it

430
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,759
says i hope all is well sir bro things

431
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,519
are great it's summertime i'm healthy

432
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:25,360
business is booming relationships are

433
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:27,519
good we've been having a good time uh

434
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:30,560
the world hasn't exploded yet so i guess

435
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:32,560
things are going quite well the question

436
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:35,679
says have you ever initiated a back

437
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:36,638
cross using pollen from the original

438
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:39,198
male

439
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:41,120
donor the original male donor using

440
00:14:39,198 --> 00:14:42,719
pollen initiated a background so if i

441
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,679
had the original male

442
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,440
i probably wouldn't need to make a back

443
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:49,838
cross the reason i make a back cross

444
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,920
generally is because the male plant is

445
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,680
not present and i want to make seeds of

446
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:55,120
a female plant something we would call a

447
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:56,399
clone only

448
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,320
so generally

449
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:00,879
i wouldn't do that because i don't have

450
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,720
the original male pollen donor my main

451
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:05,600
goal when i'm making a back cross is to

452
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,440
replicate a female clone

453
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,959
so let's talk about how i make a back

454
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,959
cross since we're here uh what i would

455
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:14,000
do let's just say we want to make golden

456
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:15,599
goat back cross seeds people want golden

457
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,679
goat regular seeds they don't want the

458
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,600
femmes they want golden goat that's not

459
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:22,399
available because there's no male of the

460
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,480
golden goat available so what i did was

461
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,000
i took daybreaker daybreaker is a great

462
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,399
strain but it is completely different

463
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,559
than golden goat it is the opposite in

464
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,879
every way it's got big fat leaves it

465
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:34,559
grows kind of with a stretchier pattern

466
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:36,000
uh it's a little shorter and squatty but

467
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:37,679
stretchy at the same time if you grow

468
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,039
kush you know what i mean but it is

469
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:40,958
totally different than the golden goat

470
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:41,838
golden goat's got the big skinny sativa

471
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:44,239
leaves

472
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:46,880
really tight internode spacing so my

473
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:49,198
goal here i took a male daybreaker plant

474
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:50,639
and i pollinated a female golden goat

475
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:52,559
now when i found the plants that came

476
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,320
from there my goal was to replicate

477
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:56,879
golden goat so anything that looked like

478
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,639
daybreaker and that progeny got

479
00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:00,480
immediately eliminated that was harder

480
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,159
to say than it looked the plants that

481
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,480
looked like daybreaker got cold from the

482
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:06,399
population right away i only needed

483
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,839
plants that look like golden goat and i

484
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,679
only needed a boy that looked like

485
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:11,279
golden goat so females got pulled right

486
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:13,758
away and plants that look like

487
00:16:11,278 --> 00:16:16,078
daybreaker got pulled right away

488
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:18,800
eventually i narrowed it down to a male

489
00:16:16,078 --> 00:16:21,039
plant they looked just like the golden

490
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:23,679
goat he grew the same way he had the

491
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:25,679
same leaf serrations he reacted the same

492
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:28,000
way to stress it looked just like the

493
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:29,599
original female golden goat it looked so

494
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,360
close to the original golden goat though

495
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,360
when i took leaves off and held it up to

496
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,680
the other leaves they matched perfectly

497
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,839
they had the same serration same ripple

498
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:40,958
it was a perfect match so i took the

499
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:41,920
pollen from my golden goat to daybreaker

500
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,278
cross

501
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:45,519
and it's a male that looks just like

502
00:16:43,278 --> 00:16:48,480
golden goat i took that pollen and put

503
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:50,480
it on to the golden goat now my goal

504
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,639
here is to wash out the traits from that

505
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:55,039
daybreaker now we've got golden goat in

506
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:57,120
here twice daybreaker in here once

507
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:59,679
mathematically genetically this should

508
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,919
be mostly golden go the way that i saw

509
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:04,000
it in my prediction i thought that i

510
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:06,000
picked such a close golden goat dip

511
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,160
probably 80 to 90 percent of the

512
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,400
phenotypes should look just like golden

513
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,000
goat after we ran a bunch of the seeds

514
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,480
you guys have ran a bunch of them i'm

515
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,279
going to say 75 percent of them look

516
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:19,199
just like the original golden go so my

517
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:21,519
next step would be to back cross it

518
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:23,279
again in that process what i would do is

519
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:25,838
i would take the original golden goat

520
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:27,599
clone which is a female and i would find

521
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:29,440
some of those back cross the first

522
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:31,519
failure filial generation of the back

523
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,120
cross that's a back cross one i would

524
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:35,359
find a male out of there that looked

525
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:37,519
just like golden goat again and put that

526
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:40,319
pollen back on the original golden goat

527
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:42,879
clone again making a back cross number

528
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:45,279
two now the seeds that come out of there

529
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,400
should in theory if my selection was

530
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:48,240
done correctly

531
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,880
those should be approximately eighty

532
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:53,200
percent golden goat dominant phenotypes

533
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,960
maybe eighty two eighty four percent the

534
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,960
method here is to keep finding golden

535
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,880
goat looking males and putting that

536
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,519
pollen back onto the original golden

537
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:04,000
goat to solidify that golden goat trait

538
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:05,440
and in essence wash out all of the

539
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
traits of the daybreaker i don't want

540
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,919
the daybreaker in there i only used it

541
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,400
for that pollen for that one inception

542
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:14,880
for that one round to create some seeds

543
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:17,038
now my whole goal is to wash that out so

544
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,960
i don't think i would use the original

545
00:18:17,038 --> 00:18:21,519
male pollen um

546
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:24,000
unless my goal is to lock in that male

547
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:25,200
trait but that doesn't seem necessary

548
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,440
because

549
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,360
i'm working with a female clone only now

550
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,279
let's hypothetically say

551
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:32,959
that a friend of mine got a seed of a

552
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:35,759
plant that i've been wanting forever but

553
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:38,000
it turned out to be a male i could

554
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:40,960
in theory take that male plant pollinate

555
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,798
a female create seeds find a female that

556
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,960
looks like the male that i want use that

557
00:18:42,798 --> 00:18:47,119
original male to put on another female

558
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,798
and keep going but

559
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:50,639
i don't know what i'm looking for

560
00:18:48,798 --> 00:18:52,240
because i don't have the original female

561
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,400
so it's kind of a wild goose chase there

562
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,480
i don't know exactly what my goal is

563
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,919
unless i can identify the female that

564
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,759
i'm looking for i need to know what it

565
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:03,679
grows like what it looks like

566
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:06,079
what it smells like so in most cases no

567
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:08,000
i would not initiate a back cross using

568
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:10,159
pollen from the original male pollen

569
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,919
donor if i had the original male then i

570
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:14,000
wouldn't need the back cross

571
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,679
um that is going backwards my whole goal

572
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,839
is to wash out the pollen from that

573
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:19,120
original male so i think that answers

574
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:21,038
the question i hope i answered the

575
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:22,719
question there if that did spark any

576
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:24,400
more questions please do follow up i

577
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,480
would love to hear from you the email

578
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,720
address of course is grow from your

579
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,160
heart at

580
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:31,679
hotmail.com let's keep moving i do have

581
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,759
a big stack of emails here right in

582
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,200
front of me this one comes from our

583
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:36,640
friend do they want their name said it

584
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,720
does not say if they want their name

585
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,720
said this one goes a little bit like

586
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:43,038
this it says yo rasta jeff i'm asking

587
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:45,839
about that 10 days in flowering on the

588
00:19:43,038 --> 00:19:47,679
light change to 18 6. so let me recap a

589
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:49,359
little bit right there for about the

590
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:51,360
past year i've been talking about a

591
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:54,798
method where i turn my lights to 18

592
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:57,839
hours on and six hours off for the last

593
00:19:54,798 --> 00:19:59,918
10 to 14 days of flowering many people

594
00:19:57,839 --> 00:20:02,079
think that flushing is a myth if you do

595
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:05,200
or don't flush when you start flushing

596
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:07,519
just turn those lights back on to 18 6.

597
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,120
in my experience your buds will get

598
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:11,599
beefier they'll get more dense they'll

599
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:14,000
get fatter they may even finish up a few

600
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:16,079
days early that extra light really makes

601
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,159
the plants go faster i really think it

602
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:20,399
does a lot of great things so our friend

603
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:23,600
here is trying the 18 6 method and they

604
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:26,159
do ask how much ppfd should i run i'm

605
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:28,480
currently at about a thousand with 13

606
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:30,799
11. so that's a great switch from 13 11

607
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,960
to 18.6 that'll be a great cycle

608
00:20:30,798 --> 00:20:35,279
but i would not recommend changing the

609
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,319
ppfd all i do is change the amount of

610
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:38,399
hours

611
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:41,200
changing the pepfd will be too many

612
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,798
variables in my opinion i wouldn't go up

613
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,319
i wouldn't go down i would just change

614
00:20:42,798 --> 00:20:46,558
the amount of hours then you're going to

615
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:48,240
get more white without stressing them if

616
00:20:46,558 --> 00:20:50,000
you change it to more light you may burn

617
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,440
them if you change it to less light it's

618
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,079
kind of pointless to increase the amount

619
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,759
of hours so i don't change anything i go

620
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:57,439
with the exact same amount of light the

621
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:59,599
same number of lights all i do is

622
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,759
increase the amount of hours which the

623
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:04,558
plants are given somebody else also

624
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:06,960
asked me if i do a ramp up if i do like

625
00:21:04,558 --> 00:21:09,359
going from 12 12 do i do 13 hours one

626
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:12,798
day and then 14 the next no i go

627
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:14,879
straight from 12 12 to 18 on and six off

628
00:21:12,798 --> 00:21:16,480
sometimes i'll even do 19 and five

629
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,640
that's a new thing i'm [ __ ] with

630
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,960
seems to be working the plants do seem

631
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,640
to enjoy that i've got one more question

632
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,079
for this episode this one comes from

633
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,720
another person who would like to remain

634
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:29,119
anonymous it says what is the reason

635
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,558
some plants lose their aroma at the end

636
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:32,158
of flower

637
00:21:30,558 --> 00:21:34,240
there are a lot of things that could be

638
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:36,960
causing this this could be a nutrient

639
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,960
issue this could be a vpd issue this

640
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,880
could be a light intensity issue are

641
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,000
your lights too close and too hot to the

642
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,600
plant

643
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,679
the number one thing that breaks down

644
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:47,038
terpenes is heat so if you've got too

645
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:49,038
much heat in the room the terps are

646
00:21:47,038 --> 00:21:50,558
getting destroyed so the first thing i

647
00:21:49,038 --> 00:21:53,279
would do is check on the heat check the

648
00:21:50,558 --> 00:21:54,960
vpd how hot is it in that room maybe get

649
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:57,279
it a little bit cooler toward the end of

650
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:59,279
harvest uh cold temperatures later in

651
00:21:57,279 --> 00:22:01,119
the grow will give you better flavors

652
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:03,119
aromas and also will bring out some

653
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:05,759
really cool colors and may really help

654
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:07,678
with the density of your buds so this

655
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:10,720
could be a feed issue

656
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:12,880
this could be a vpd issue this could be

657
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,880
a lighting issue this also could be a

658
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,960
genetics issue are you not cutting down

659
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,960
on time are you letting them go too long

660
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,798
are they simply going into senescence

661
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,319
and just giving up are you not feeding

662
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:24,798
them long enough are you feeding them

663
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:26,879
too long are you feeding anything to

664
00:22:24,798 --> 00:22:28,480
enhance the terpenes are you giving it

665
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,960
anything to make it smell good what are

666
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,640
you doing um there are several things

667
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,319
that i would check on i would check on

668
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,400
like i've already said temperature

669
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:38,158
that's my number one uh culprit for

670
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,559
killing terps then i would check on

671
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,159
light intensity how far from the canopy

672
00:22:40,558 --> 00:22:43,759
is your light is it just roasting your

673
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:45,280
terps you should be able to tell by

674
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:47,279
looking at the plants

675
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:49,359
do you have plenty of airflow in there

676
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:50,960
do you have bugs then i would make sure

677
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:53,519
that you're feeding something to

678
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,120
encourage healthy plants i can't see the

679
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:57,279
room i don't have a lot of details but

680
00:22:55,119 --> 00:23:00,079
those are things that i do think could

681
00:22:57,279 --> 00:23:02,399
make plants lose their smell at the end

682
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:04,319
