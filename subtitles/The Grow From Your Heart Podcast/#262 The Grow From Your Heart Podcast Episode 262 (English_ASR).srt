00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,199
like you know not all the time but I

134
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,849

itchy for some reason I don't know about

can get from BHO in really quality rosin

166
00:05:25,329 --> 00:05:30,430
it's just a it's really credit to the

167
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,900
grower you know I mean because those

168
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:33,819
herbs can't they can't really be

169
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:37,120
captured unless the the cannabis was

170
00:05:33,819 --> 00:05:39,668
quality enough to to to do it in solving

171
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,918
lists that's the difference between you

172
00:05:39,668 --> 00:05:44,349
know doing BHO and solving lists is is

173
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:45,909
you can take some all right stuff would

174
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:48,039
be a Cho and and turn into a really

175
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:50,289
quality looking product yeah but in

176
00:05:48,038 --> 00:05:51,699
solving this it's very hard it's very

177
00:05:50,288 --> 00:05:53,379
rare that you see something like that

178
00:05:51,699 --> 00:05:55,659
happened you take some really quality of

179
00:05:53,379 --> 00:05:57,550
cannabis to to make a super premium

180
00:05:55,660 --> 00:06:00,400
product okay that makes more sense to me

181
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:01,240
I like smoking rosin it was made from

182
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:03,699
bubble hash

183
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:07,470
otherwise I have never had rosin made

184
00:06:03,699 --> 00:06:07,469
straight from flour that I appreciate

185
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:16,030
it's hash frozen you're just Guardian

186
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:18,879
there's people who isolate the turps in

187
00:06:16,029 --> 00:06:21,638
a nice wax and a full melt it's already

188
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:24,129
premiere so when you when you take away

189
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:26,410
what's not melting and you leave it in a

190
00:06:24,129 --> 00:06:28,180
freshly pressed rosin or just rosin

191
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:30,160
fresh frozen or whatever the case may be

192
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:32,530
you just have such a premier product

193
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:35,380
it's a no to be able to compare it to

194
00:06:32,529 --> 00:06:40,089
something like BHO and not have a

195
00:06:35,379 --> 00:06:41,189
carbohydrate extract it's it's it's just

196
00:06:40,089 --> 00:06:43,449
I don't know it's just

197
00:06:41,189 --> 00:06:44,920
it's really nice to have the peace of

198
00:06:43,449 --> 00:06:47,199
mind in the back of your mind that there

199
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:50,290
was nothing no butane ran over the plant

200
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:52,750
that you took your 60-day harvest to

201
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:54,670
grow you know I mean yeah yeah yeah

202
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:57,250
instead of just washing it yeah

203
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:58,600
I've seen my friends watch my wife I've

204
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,980
watched my friends faces when I've said

205
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,030
yeah and then you just blow butane over

206
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:03,160
it turn it into hash and they're like

207
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:04,750
what I grew this for so long

208
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:08,050
now don't worry Ron there's people that

209
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:10,329
do butane they're real artists that know

210
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:12,040
what they're doing that can explain to

211
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:14,019
you step by step what's really going on

212
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,670
I think there's so many people out there

213
00:07:14,019 --> 00:07:17,859
pretending that they know what's going

214
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:20,439
on there's a difference there's good

215
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:22,000
extracts and there's better yeah there's

216
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:24,250
and bad extractors just like all things

217
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,040
yeah okay so extractor is not a

218
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:29,350
derogatory term anymore do you guys

219
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:35,379
smoke the the high cannabinoid or high

220
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:37,810
terpene extracts okay okay I can't say

221
00:07:35,379 --> 00:07:40,269
we don't we we we haven't been smoking

222
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:43,600
pho for I would say over half a year now

223
00:07:40,269 --> 00:07:47,019
but what we have had our garden ran into

224
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:48,610
a full full spectrum extract and I mean

225
00:07:47,019 --> 00:07:50,529
it's not like we didn't try it or

226
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:53,350
anything it came out premier and stuff

227
00:07:50,529 --> 00:07:55,209
it's quality and quality out but it's

228
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:58,420
just it's just a choice thing at this

229
00:07:55,209 --> 00:08:01,180
point it's like I'm we're already

230
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:03,189
growing clean cannabis so it's like we

231
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:05,050
rather just stay on a solving this

232
00:08:03,189 --> 00:08:06,579
lifestyle it makes perfect sense to me

233
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:08,920
keep it clean don't put anything else in

234
00:08:06,579 --> 00:08:09,689
there facts all right I like it I like

235
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,890
it

236
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:13,000
I'm gonna quit coughing pretty soon you

237
00:08:11,889 --> 00:08:14,379
guys I'm gonna quit hitting that joint

238
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
yeah and I'll get I'll get my voice

239
00:08:14,379 --> 00:08:18,209
together let's see

240
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,790
you guys want to jump right into no-till

241
00:08:18,209 --> 00:08:22,930
so no-till no-till to the best of my

242
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:24,310
knowledge I know we've done an episode a

243
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:26,019
long time ago and I feel like I may have

244
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:28,600
learned a little bit you start a pot

245
00:08:26,019 --> 00:08:31,089
with a condition to soil with a very

246
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:33,100
amended soil then you let that soil come

247
00:08:31,089 --> 00:08:34,990
to life you know are there worms in that

248
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:36,159
soil yeah okay so you got worms and a

249
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:38,379
lot of ingredients we'll talk about the

250
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:42,189
ingredients next you got a pot filled

251
00:08:38,379 --> 00:08:43,659
with amendments lots of things worms and

252
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:44,080
it comes alive then you plant your plant

253
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:46,569
in there

254
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,340
then your plant grows and you only have

255
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:49,780
to feed it water is that correct because

256
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:51,610
everything's already in the soil you can

257
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:53,139
add teas by the look on your face I mean

258
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:54,250
you can do teas and stuff like that so

259
00:08:53,139 --> 00:08:56,799
see the very first

260
00:08:54,250 --> 00:09:00,639
son like um you got to get the the

261
00:08:56,799 --> 00:09:02,829
decomposition to be going quick enough

262
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:04,600
to be feeding the plant correctly okay

263
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:06,310
so all those things I mixed in have to

264
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:08,680
get broken down and start becoming

265
00:09:06,309 --> 00:09:10,269
bioavailable for my plant over time how

266
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:12,939
does how long does that take 3060 days

267
00:09:10,269 --> 00:09:14,409
you know I would say the first round the

268
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:15,580
first round you got to just be doing a

269
00:09:14,409 --> 00:09:18,189
whole lot of things you got to be doing

270
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:19,900
like a you know do a lot of Bo Kashi and

271
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:22,900
stuff okay top dressed a lot of Bo Kashi

272
00:09:19,899 --> 00:09:24,939
nice you know speed up that process yeah

273
00:09:22,899 --> 00:09:27,519
also the yeah the worms will like and

274
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:29,200
stuff like that feed a lot of malted

275
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:30,759
barley and stuff like that you know just

276
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,280
grind up a whole bunch of to roll matzo

277
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:34,899
ball malted barley and uh you know just

278
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,850
to top dress that a lot you'll see your

279
00:09:34,899 --> 00:09:39,100
worms come to the top and I think just

280
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:41,800
them coming up and mulching so much it

281
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:43,570
was just you know speed it up yeah all

282
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:46,419
right man the more you speed it up then

283
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:49,629
I think after that now you know I got

284
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:51,219
pots that are probably on 14 you know 15

285
00:09:49,629 --> 00:09:52,210
rounds or something like that so in

286
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:53,920
those pots

287
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:55,389
I am only feeding water and stuff like

288
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:57,610
that you know I do a few top dressings

289
00:09:55,389 --> 00:10:00,159
just like yeah you know earthworm

290
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:02,620
castings you know I do a few malted

291
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:05,559
barley 's but really nothing it's just

292
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:07,450
like after I pull the plants out I mean

293
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:08,949
I just pull like the you know the root

294
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:10,870
ball out just because I'm in like 10 and

295
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:13,690
15 gallons right now in the future when

296
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:14,589
I have more space I'll do beds okay beds

297
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:17,440
are better yeah

298
00:10:14,589 --> 00:10:18,700
I'll leave the stock and the rube all

299
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,160
stuff like that and I'll let it just

300
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:22,839
decompose oh nice let's plant right next

301
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:24,730
to it yeah okay but right now I'm having

302
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:26,530
a pull out you know the little bitty

303
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:28,659
root ball by the time I pull it out

304
00:10:26,529 --> 00:10:31,809
though I'll leave it in there a few days

305
00:10:28,659 --> 00:10:33,549
I top dress bouquet she I feed it the

306
00:10:31,809 --> 00:10:34,569
worms will come eat you know what they

307
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:35,829
need to and stuff like that the

308
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:37,150
beneficials will break down the roots

309
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:38,950
and stuff like that for food and stuff

310
00:10:37,149 --> 00:10:41,110
like that it'll speed it up and like

311
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:42,850
after like five or seven days then we'll

312
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:46,539
pull them out you know pull it out and

313
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:48,310
then all a plant in either a cup it'll

314
00:10:46,539 --> 00:10:49,689
be from a cup or a one gallon so we're

315
00:10:48,309 --> 00:10:52,659
not really disturbing the soil at all

316
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:54,940
you know maybe a the top layer a little

317
00:10:52,659 --> 00:10:56,799
bit a fist-sized section yeah all right

318
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:58,720
keep keeping everything just going no

319
00:10:56,799 --> 00:11:01,179
stuff like that that that ecosystems

320
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,040
just rock and do like I mean if you just

321
00:11:01,179 --> 00:11:05,439
saw how much like beneficials I have

322
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:06,819
going in my pots I mean it's insane dude

323
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,750
you put something in there and it

324
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:09,100
decomposes so

325
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:11,409
quicken dishes being broken down so

326
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:13,420
quick your life this is insane yeah so

327
00:11:11,409 --> 00:11:15,399
if I through excuse me what would you

328
00:11:13,419 --> 00:11:19,629
throw on top - why'd you throw on top -

329
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:20,980
let it decompose right now right now we

330
00:11:19,629 --> 00:11:23,230
don't really need to throw anything on

331
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:25,779
top right now like just because I'm so

332
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:27,340
far in flower on a you know on the

333
00:11:25,779 --> 00:11:29,289
section that I'm doing right now the the

334
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:30,730
right section though I would top dress I

335
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:33,279
just threw it in a flower so it's on

336
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:34,779
like five days in the flower so now when

337
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:36,279
you know top dress them some Niemann

338
00:11:34,779 --> 00:11:38,470
cope just to get a whole bunch of good

339
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:41,289
you know minerals and stuff like that

340
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:43,120
but what I what I've been feeding even

341
00:11:41,289 --> 00:11:46,000
you know right whenever I get into a

342
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,560
flower or even in a veg and stuff like

343
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,179
that as I've been feeding insect frass

344
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:51,279
has like every micro macro

345
00:11:49,179 --> 00:11:53,439
like available to Sean talks a lot about

346
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:56,379
insect frass also I mean it's like to to

347
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,760
to like it's everything do so like you

348
00:11:56,379 --> 00:11:59,649
feed it to your plan you see them just

349
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:01,090
like going ham you know you feed a few

350
00:11:59,649 --> 00:12:03,759
extra things with like some Hollow

351
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:07,840
you know but really what what I really

352
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:10,509
feed in a flower stuff like that is what

353
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:12,519
builds flowers for us you know not using

354
00:12:10,509 --> 00:12:14,588
any type of like synthetic you know

355
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:18,399
things to build the flowers what we're

356
00:12:14,589 --> 00:12:20,350
using is is a potassium okay potassium

357
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:22,600
is what builds a flower all right I mean

358
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:24,790
it appeals oh I mean it'll throw these

359
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:26,889
things huge you can do a fermented fruit

360
00:12:24,789 --> 00:12:28,209
juices with bananas stuff like that you

361
00:12:26,889 --> 00:12:30,370
know and so you can get it like

362
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:31,629
fermented fruit juice it's just you know

363
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:33,190
it's fermenting and stuff like that so

364
00:12:31,629 --> 00:12:33,610
it's super strong and potassium stuff

365
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:35,650
like that

366
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:37,419
but what I've been doing is I just been

367
00:12:35,649 --> 00:12:39,009
using coconut water if you look at

368
00:12:37,419 --> 00:12:40,509
coconut oil yeah do to have so much

369
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:42,399
potassium in that's crazy then I have

370
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:44,110
all the cast has a Hazzard coconut water

371
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,929
if you need to deliver guys I mean it's

372
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:48,190
crazy yeah fill the soil cells in but

373
00:12:46,929 --> 00:12:49,719
you know I feel like you can get other

374
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:52,030
places stuff like that I like Jeremy and

375
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:54,100
stuff like that like you know no bad

376
00:12:52,029 --> 00:12:56,049
words about Jeremy on them it's just you

377
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:58,149
know I think you can get things cheaper

378
00:12:56,049 --> 00:12:59,439
and go elsewhere and stuff like that I

379
00:12:58,149 --> 00:13:00,819
think in the beginning to use them and

380
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,200
stuff like that to buy some soil from

381
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:03,460
them and they make things easy so you

382
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,379
don't have to mix your own soil right

383
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:07,660
you know that's that's some good stuff

384
00:13:05,379 --> 00:13:09,580
but uh other than that you know say just

385
00:13:07,659 --> 00:13:10,449
just go where you can growing although

386
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:13,240
plant you know

387
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:14,860
yeah I'm although so huge in the no-till

388
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:18,129
regimen just because you want to just be

389
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:19,899
feeding you know the the whole soil

390
00:13:18,129 --> 00:13:20,870
system and stuff like that so you want

391
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:22,819
to be just you know

392
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:24,470
getting everything everywhere and stuff

393
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:29,180
like that I stopped using potassium

394
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:31,340
silica just use a jacilla canal it's

395
00:13:29,179 --> 00:13:33,139
pure silica from rice holes made from

396
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:34,820
rice holes so I'm not getting potassium

397
00:13:33,139 --> 00:13:36,740
boosts and stuff like that so the only

398
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:38,870
potassium I'm you know feeding to the

399
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:40,879
plants is the coconut that I'm you know

400
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:42,799
using this yeah yeah all right but I

401
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:44,299
mean assume if I stuck a carrot in one

402
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:45,699
of your no-till pots right now how long

403
00:13:44,299 --> 00:13:49,519
would it take for that carrot to be gone

404
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:50,390
um dude it'd be quick dude I'd say three

405
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:52,429
four days Wow

406
00:13:50,389 --> 00:13:55,519
Oh just eat that carrot up I mean quick

407
00:13:52,429 --> 00:13:57,409
yes um the fungi the fungus would

408
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,519
overtake it so quick - I think mushrooms

409
00:13:57,409 --> 00:14:00,350
will start growing around and stuff I

410
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:03,139
mean it's crazy if that white fur on it

411
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:05,330
real quick yeah it's amazing three days

412
00:14:03,139 --> 00:14:06,860
is fast I mean it's crazy that's awesome

413
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:08,120
it'll blow your mind yeah I'd love to

414
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:09,769
see it how hot is it in there if you

415
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,060
stick your hand in that pot how hot do

416
00:14:09,769 --> 00:14:12,769
you think it's real hot inside there no

417
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:16,279
dude it's cool like it's really cool

418
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:18,889
like it's like you know I would say it's

419
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:20,509
you know not not cold or nothing like

420
00:14:18,889 --> 00:14:22,399
that it's just cool it's like nice and

421
00:14:20,509 --> 00:14:24,980
you know it's always moist and stuff

422
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,730
like that the pots always say you know

423
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:27,889
very moist

424
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:29,659
you know I've a few pots in there that I

425
00:14:27,889 --> 00:14:30,860
grow some even some vegetables in and

426
00:14:29,659 --> 00:14:32,179
stuff like that we throw some peppers

427
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:34,399
and stuff in the positive stuff like

428
00:14:32,179 --> 00:14:36,169
that you know harvest your you know your

429
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,789
cannabis and be harvesting some peppers

430
00:14:36,169 --> 00:14:39,500
and peppers and [ __ ] like that yeah

431
00:14:37,789 --> 00:14:42,049
growing them all together and get is a

432
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:44,480
cover crop yeah I think I think pests

433
00:14:42,049 --> 00:14:45,409
hate that [ __ ] to you know ask plants

434
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,060
tell you they don't want to eat that

435
00:14:45,409 --> 00:14:49,189
[ __ ] you know they're they're [ __ ]

436
00:14:47,059 --> 00:14:50,779
scramming you know so you just throwing

437
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:52,190
good things up top like you know the

438
00:14:50,779 --> 00:14:54,500
cover crop that I usually plan is

439
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:55,550
lemongrass you know we do some clover

440
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,990
stuff like that cuz you're trying to

441
00:14:55,549 --> 00:14:59,029
pull nitrogen you're trying to pull

442
00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:00,289
nitrogen directly from the atmosphere so

443
00:14:59,029 --> 00:15:02,299
the best thing to do is a cover crop you

444
00:15:00,289 --> 00:15:03,500
have it you have a good cover crop and

445
00:15:02,299 --> 00:15:04,729
stuff like that and then you throw some

446
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,049
mulch on there and you know you throw

447
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:07,940
some some good mulch on there but that

448
00:15:06,049 --> 00:15:09,439
cover crop will grow so quick you know

449
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:10,880
you're throwing your you're cutting that

450
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,500
throwing that on there you're taking

451
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:14,000
leaves off stuff like that your mulch is

452
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,620
getting crazy and just see your

453
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,820
defoliation that you do the leaves you

454
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:19,250
pull off you just throw those in the pot

455
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:20,690
also uh-huh yeah remedy trash I think

456
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:22,519
yeah I think how much food is in those

457
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:23,710
leaves just nitrogen going right back

458
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:27,458
into your plant Oh

459
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:29,389
recycling bro is that cannibalism yeah

460
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:30,708
alright what else is in your cover crop

461
00:15:29,389 --> 00:15:32,269
bro since you're going on about cover

462
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:34,458
crop I'm gonna get as much info as I can

463
00:15:32,269 --> 00:15:38,269
about this cover crop um the best thing

464
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:39,979
to do is for sure's is clover and stuff

465
00:15:38,269 --> 00:15:42,799
like that is just you know crimson

466
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:43,970
clover and stuff like that but uh you

467
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:45,439
know that's just gonna pull like the

468
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:46,519
most nitrogen and stuff like that but

469
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,410
other than that you know if there's some

470
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:49,639
lemongrass in there you know you throw

471
00:15:48,409 --> 00:15:50,990
some good things like that throw pepper

472
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:52,519
plan you know throw some dough some

473
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:54,200
vegetables in there and stuff like that

474
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:55,370
I wouldn't really say but tomato or

475
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,410
nothing like that or like something

476
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:58,789
that's gonna pull a whole bunch of suck

477
00:15:57,409 --> 00:16:01,250
up all your nutrients to get too big

478
00:15:58,789 --> 00:16:03,379
yeah alfalfa the size type stuff yeah

479
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:05,089
there's some simple okay all right but

480
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:07,759
it's a little bit when I'm building my

481
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:09,740
when you're building a no-till pot what

482
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:12,980
ingredients go into the pot to get you

483
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:15,470
started well so the ingredients to go in

484
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:17,899
I think you know it's a pretty long

485
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:21,620
process so it's um you know they're

486
00:16:17,899 --> 00:16:23,570
using it's basically compost like just

487
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:26,120
for the most part like just say for the

488
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:28,610
most part is gonna be compost so you

489
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:30,078
know like Malibu compost okay easy to

490
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:31,850
find very easy to find you guys almost

491
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:33,919
all your larger grow stores will have

492
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:36,470
some Malibu compost for you it's not the

493
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:40,370
order yeah some amazon has it compost

494
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:42,170
earthworm castings you know that's gonna

495
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:44,620
be one part and then there's gonna be

496
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:49,639
one part you know peat moss okay and

497
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:51,679
then it would be you know I think or

498
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:54,319
though there are one part pumice you

499
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:56,449

587
00:19:32,299 --> 00:19:36,470
plants that are you know getting pretty

588
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:38,470
close to finishing and you know they

589
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:40,400
still price say they have like you know

590
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:42,589
you know three weeks or something like

591
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,030
that and then we just brought some new

592
00:19:42,589 --> 00:19:45,319
plants in and stuff like that and threw

593
00:19:44,029 --> 00:19:46,759
them in a flower and you know they had a

594
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:49,759
few mice on them stuff like that just

595
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:50,990
from you know not being on my IPM sprays

596
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:52,700
like I shouldn't stuff like that and

597
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:54,259
having little one gallons over here that

598
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:56,059
uh you know I get cuttings and stuff

599
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:57,890
like that from friends so they got a few

600
00:19:56,059 --> 00:19:59,629
spider mind stuff like that on there we

601
00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:01,460
take them in there and stuff like that I

602
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:02,720
mean we don't even have to spray or

603
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:03,769
nothing like that the left side or

604
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,089
nothing like that because they're so far

605
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:06,529
in the flower you know if we sprayed

606
00:20:05,089 --> 00:20:07,759
anything we spray something you know so

607
00:20:06,529 --> 00:20:11,269
organic that wouldn't matter

608
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:15,470
I probably spray oil after day 35 so if

609
00:20:11,269 --> 00:20:17,839
I sprayed anything I'd spray uh um you

610
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:19,220
know labs lactobacillus sir huh

611
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:20,689
yeah spray something like that that uh

612
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:22,220
your plant would eat your plant would

613
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:23,450
use it and stuff like that yeah she's

614
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:25,250
got to be kind of careful you spray that

615
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:26,990
too much it'll raise the Brix levels in

616
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:28,759
your soil so quick and stuff like that

617
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:30,950
you got test the Brix levels in your

618
00:20:28,759 --> 00:20:33,230
soil after you spray some [ __ ] lives

619
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:34,970
you're like you know this is crazy you

620
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:36,710
know but it just has so much sugar and

621
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:39,200
so much you know beneficial and so much

622
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:40,880
good [ __ ] to it you know you're playing

623
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,380
a sit though don't go too crazy with it

624
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,010
you can't overdo it yeah you totally

625
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:45,500
overdo it

626
00:20:43,009 --> 00:20:46,579
yeah you can't for sure but yeah so you

627
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,230
know I would spray something like that

628
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:49,789
or even spray like some Allah or some

629
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:51,110
you know some coconut water or something

630
00:20:49,789 --> 00:20:53,809
like that I wouldn't really say you know

631
00:20:51,109 --> 00:20:55,219
go spraying oil after day 35 but you

632
00:20:53,809 --> 00:20:57,230
wouldn't really need to like I'm saying

633
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:58,910
these plants are over here doing fine

634
00:20:57,230 --> 00:21:01,460
these other plants have been hitting in

635
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:03,860
here over a week they're clean now I

636
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:05,660
sprayed them a few times with an IPM

637
00:21:03,859 --> 00:21:07,849
that I you know normally doing stuff

638
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:09,140
like that but then naturally I think the

639
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:10,490
beneficial is coming from the left side

640
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:12,320
coming to the right side and all that

641
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:13,640
stuff it's a good mixture you know let

642
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:14,899
these mites come in here and play and

643
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,640
get real scared and [ __ ] like that and

644
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,990
they you know the beneficials gonna eat

645
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,310
them all and show like that and then you

646
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:21,620
know it's it's taken care of and then

647
00:21:19,309 --> 00:21:23,089
we're just you know sticking the land

648
00:21:21,619 --> 00:21:25,039
and we're like let's make sure we get

649
00:21:23,089 --> 00:21:28,309
this something I've noticed I've been

650
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:30,139
introducing lace wings into my IPM mix

651
00:21:28,309 --> 00:21:32,690
nice so I've got three different kinds

652
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:34,250
of party termites I've got the hypo

653
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:35,660
aspis in the dirt I've got some other

654
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:37,190
guys crawling around in the dirt I can't

655
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:40,009
pronounce and then I've been releasing

656
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:43,340
lacewing eggs something I think the lace

657
00:21:40,009 --> 00:21:44,480
wings are doing is they heard the little

658
00:21:43,339 --> 00:21:46,519
bit of spider mites that couldn't get

659
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:49,519
rid of our heard it onto one plant under

660
00:21:46,519 --> 00:21:51,259
one cola there's lace wings all around

661
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:53,180
the room and they're like in a circle

662
00:21:51,259 --> 00:21:54,589
around this one table and then there's

663
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:56,029
another ring of them around this one

664
00:21:54,589 --> 00:21:57,919
plant and all the spider mites have

665
00:21:56,029 --> 00:21:59,809
congregated in this one plant so I just

666
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:01,070
cut that nug off and all the spider

667
00:21:59,809 --> 00:22:03,139
mites they feel like will be gone and

668
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:04,759
all the lace wings will be like haha but

669
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:06,380
it was need to come in and be like I

670
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:07,878
don't see any mites anywhere oh they're

671
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:09,229
right here they were just on

672
00:22:07,878 --> 00:22:10,998
kolja I was like all the mites in the

673
00:22:09,229 --> 00:22:12,709
whole facility congregated here I think

674
00:22:10,999 --> 00:22:14,568
all those [ __ ] lations ate everybody

675
00:22:12,709 --> 00:22:15,889
else and they're just gathering and they

676
00:22:14,568 --> 00:22:17,989
were gonna have a feast on the left

677
00:22:15,888 --> 00:22:19,278
leftovers yeah but they're gone now cut

678
00:22:17,989 --> 00:22:20,509
that coal out and now they're just lace

679
00:22:19,278 --> 00:22:22,729
wings flying around looking for food

680
00:22:20,509 --> 00:22:24,469
yeah they like herded them as per day

681
00:22:22,729 --> 00:22:25,548
and then no eventually died and stuff

682
00:22:24,469 --> 00:22:26,749
like that you gotta yeah and they're

683
00:22:25,548 --> 00:22:28,729
[ __ ] in your pots and stuff like

684
00:22:26,749 --> 00:22:30,469
that too and throwing insect frass in

685
00:22:28,729 --> 00:22:32,690
there yeah well and they're breeding and

686
00:22:30,469 --> 00:22:34,759
making more eggs hopefully and dying and

687
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:35,929
[ __ ] like yeah and then you know

688

that has a lot of nutrients stuff like

690
00:22:37,608 --> 00:22:41,509
that and it's crazy go back into my pots

691
00:22:40,009 --> 00:22:45,169
and living for me it's fun watching

692
00:22:41,509 --> 00:22:46,909

713
00:23:19,608 --> 00:23:22,848
those all in in the soil dude yeah I

714
00:23:21,499 --> 00:23:24,649
mean they're everywhere they'll come

715
00:23:22,848 --> 00:23:25,848
organically if you come a little bit up

716
00:23:24,648 --> 00:23:27,288
on the stock and stuff but they don't

717
00:23:25,848 --> 00:23:28,908
really play in the leaves and stuff like

718
00:23:27,288 --> 00:23:30,469
that much not for me I bet you they do

719
00:23:28,909 --> 00:23:32,059
and the lights are off oh really yeah

720
00:23:30,469 --> 00:23:33,109
they climb up bits they hate light so

721
00:23:32,058 --> 00:23:35,269
they climb up there and the lights go

722
00:23:33,108 --> 00:23:36,769
off okay so you won't see during the day

723
00:23:35,269 --> 00:23:39,318
very much more the lights go off they go

724
00:23:36,769 --> 00:23:41,269
up there yeah California smites

725
00:23:39,318 --> 00:23:43,878
we're reading that they may not like

726
00:23:41,269 --> 00:23:46,219
cannabis yeah they may those the ones

727
00:23:43,878 --> 00:23:48,128
that we release to eat the bugs maybe

728
00:23:46,219 --> 00:23:50,749
may just be running away is what we read

729
00:23:48,128 --> 00:23:52,548
we use them still it's nice yeah not

730
00:23:50,749 --> 00:23:54,949
sure yes I need to get more into that

731
00:23:52,548 --> 00:23:56,808
yeah you guys use bugs to take care of

732
00:23:54,949 --> 00:23:58,249
your problems you listeners because bugs

733
00:23:56,808 --> 00:23:59,509
are better than sprays and the bugs

734
00:23:58,249 --> 00:24:01,068
don't make your extracts tastes like

735
00:23:59,509 --> 00:24:02,899
[ __ ] the bugs won't make you sick

736
00:24:01,068 --> 00:24:04,788
yeah once you cut down those plants and

737
00:24:02,898 --> 00:24:06,498
dry them and your buds start drying the

738
00:24:04,788 --> 00:24:07,578
bugs are gonna leave the predator mites

739
00:24:06,499 --> 00:24:08,838
you put on there they're gonna leave

740
00:24:07,578 --> 00:24:11,058
they're gonna go find food somewhere

741
00:24:08,838 --> 00:24:12,408
else those bugs are just like you well

742
00:24:11,058 --> 00:24:14,239
there's nothing to eat and nothing to

743
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:17,778
[ __ ] they'll go somewhere else yeah yeah

744
00:24:14,239 --> 00:24:19,159
let's yeah thanks fair I'll tell you

745
00:24:17,778 --> 00:24:20,538
good IPM though that'll keep everything

746
00:24:19,159 --> 00:24:21,500
away I want to hear it cuz that's one of

747
00:24:20,538 --> 00:24:23,299
the things I'm getting too

748
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:25,430
everybody wants to say that you know

749
00:24:23,299 --> 00:24:27,559
they get these crazy mites are these

750
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:28,970
crazy sheds you know Patrick goes to a

751
00:24:27,559 --> 00:24:30,740
few Gardens uh you know some of our

752
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:32,120
buddies having stuff like that you know

753
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:33,710
I'll go in people's gardens to that I'm

754
00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:36,069
not scared you know I'll bring whatever

755
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:38,210
they have back you know [ __ ] it um

756
00:24:36,069 --> 00:24:39,349
anyways you know Patrick you'll see some

757
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:40,700
[ __ ] he's like dude this is crazy

758
00:24:39,349 --> 00:24:43,459
whatever they have over here something

759
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:45,259
like that yeah I don't get to see these

760
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:46,610
these crazy things stuff like that I

761
00:24:45,259 --> 00:24:48,559
just haven't been know seeing just like

762
00:24:46,609 --> 00:24:50,779
having such a you know healthy ecosystem

763
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:52,579
and stuff like that but the IPM that I

764
00:24:50,779 --> 00:24:53,960
do that I think will even keep

765
00:24:52,579 --> 00:24:56,089
everything away the reason why they're

766
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:58,640
not jumping on this left side was

767
00:24:56,089 --> 00:25:00,709
because you know tilde 21 or till you

768
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,870
know day 28 or whatever like that I'm

769
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:05,539
over here spraying I mean it's real

770
00:25:02,869 --> 00:25:08,989
simple they say two to one no-name

771
00:25:05,539 --> 00:25:10,879
Carranza is better than neem or Carranza

772
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:13,819
by themselves okay so if you're gonna

773
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:16,970
spray a tablespoon per gallon per se

774
00:25:13,819 --> 00:25:19,279
alright you would do two teaspoons of

775
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:21,400
neem 1 teaspoon of piranha

776
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:23,509
alright you're gonna do that per gallon

777
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:26,000
then after that would do like a half

778
00:25:23,509 --> 00:25:28,240
ounce of essential oils that you can get

779
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,740
from builds soul they're pretty cheap

780
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:32,480
the essential oils are they're pretty

781
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:34,519
good yeah the essentials so you do a

782
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:38,240
half ounce of essential oils per gallon

783
00:25:34,519 --> 00:25:39,799
and then you would do what else would

784
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:43,970
you do after that you would do uh you

785
00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:48,139
know I guess 1/8 teaspoon of uh you know

786
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:50,990
uh silica just to keep it real nice okay

787
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:53,060
and then a little bit all oh that's real

788
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:55,130
easy that's simple and now is gonna get

789
00:25:53,059 --> 00:25:56,539
it juicy mystical silica is gonna be

790
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:57,950
good for the plants and everything else

791
00:25:56,539 --> 00:25:59,299
is gonna make bugs wish they weren't

792
00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:01,490
[ __ ] there if you want to feed a

793
00:25:59,299 --> 00:26:02,720
little bit of extra you know nutrients

794
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:04,039
and stuff like that to the plants while

795
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,319
you're doing hourly and flower stuff

796
00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:08,210
like that I would say feed some full

797
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:10,669
power in there too you know some humic

798
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:13,160
acid ok but yeah go spray that three

799
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:14,600
days in a row spray three days in a row

800
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,740
you know go in there and spray it all

801
00:26:14,599 --> 00:26:17,480
over your plants for three days whenever

802
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:20,870
the lights are off I'm telling you

803
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:22,400

805
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,310
paying attention a lot of people message

00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:27,529
me about how to get rid of mites there's

807
00:26:25,309 --> 00:26:29,089
a completely organic way to do it I get

808
00:26:27,529 --> 00:26:30,170
him to do it again because I hope you

809
00:26:29,089 --> 00:26:32,389
were listening you may have to use that

810
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:33,769
thirty-second back button there done

811
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:34,630
dude I'm telling you after you spray

812
00:26:33,769 --> 00:26:36,548
that

813
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:38,410
if you want to try another one I mean

814
00:26:36,548 --> 00:26:40,298
you can even do a one that we've really

815
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:44,320
found out you know enzymes will really

816
00:26:40,298 --> 00:26:46,990
[ __ ] up you know a pest you know they're

817
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:49,418
good for beneficials but they're bad for

818
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:51,609
pests and stuff like that yeah I don't

819
00:26:49,419 --> 00:26:53,650
know if you've heard of us soap nuts no

820
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:58,379
tell me about soap nuts okay something

821
00:26:53,650 --> 00:27:00,788
that's uh so they have like 25,000 uh or

822
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:06,490
250,000 I think PPM's or something like

823
00:27:00,788 --> 00:27:11,890
that 25,000 250,000 PBMs are some uh an

824
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:13,029
enzyme called was the enzyme called let

825
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:16,299
me think of what the enzyme is called

826
00:27:13,029 --> 00:27:17,740
but it's a it's it's super powerful and

827
00:27:16,298 --> 00:27:19,599
stuff like that so you take these soap

828
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:21,038
nuts and you can take these uh soap nuts

829
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:22,899
and it's just like a little shell and

830
00:27:21,038 --> 00:27:24,609
you know they're broken up and you take

831
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:25,870
you know you take a few of them grind

832
00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:28,779
them up and stuff like that put the

833
00:27:25,869 --> 00:27:30,969
powder and in the water and stuff like

834
00:27:28,779 --> 00:27:33,548
that and bubble it and watch how much it

835
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:35,079
bubbles up it's happening

836
00:27:33,548 --> 00:27:37,150
that's what okay so the enzyme is

837
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:39,308
sapping in so it's 25 percent zapping is

838
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:40,659
this little nut is 25% of sappiness

839
00:27:39,308 --> 00:27:42,730
so yeah I think how many snapping is

840
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:46,299
yeah so then you do two to one karanji

841
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:49,779
neem and then you do sappin is with it

842
00:27:46,298 --> 00:27:50,980
you know just that by itself that [ __ ]

843
00:27:49,779 --> 00:27:52,329
will come out you know you spray it out

844
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:53,440
of an auto miser if you got a pretty big

845
00:27:52,329 --> 00:27:54,519
garden or something like that I don't

846
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,048
know if you spray it out of a normal

847
00:27:54,519 --> 00:27:57,400
sprayer what it'll do but you spray it

848
00:27:56,048 --> 00:28:00,038
out of a auto minor stuff like that

849
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:01,840
that shit'll foam up like so much it's

850
00:28:00,038 --> 00:28:02,859
like foam covering like all your plants

851
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:05,859
and stuff like that

852
00:28:02,859 --> 00:28:07,029
can't nothin live in that soap nuts so

853
00:28:05,859 --> 00:28:09,490
you just take the soap nut water you

854
00:28:07,029 --> 00:28:11,259
bubble the soap nuts for 24 hours take

855
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:12,880
the soap nut water yeah it'll be real

856
00:28:11,259 --> 00:28:14,408
nice and bubbled up and stuff like it'll

857
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:17,289
bubble up like crazy this happens we'll

858
00:28:14,409 --> 00:28:20,440
be going crazy you take that water you

gallon do two gallons whatever you want

861
00:28:21,849 --> 00:28:26,798
to do and then you know do your uh neem

00:28:24,759 --> 00:28:28,690
and Carranza with that and then put some

863
00:28:26,798 --> 00:28:29,859
you know some silica in there if you

864
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:31,659

and stuff like that just too much

885
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:04,678
nutrients too much enzymes they'll be

886
00:29:03,278 --> 00:29:07,720
throwing up everywhere [ __ ] like that

887
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:10,269
alright just making the bugs they also

888
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:12,308
like yeah they like to get away from it

889
00:29:10,269 --> 00:29:13,509
because it's just like worm I mean a bug

890

00:29:16,179 --> 00:29:18,580
alright and then they say all those

895
00:29:17,378 --> 00:29:19,839
carcasses and they get scared and

896
00:29:18,579 --> 00:29:22,538
they're like I don't want to be there in

897
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:24,369
the the land the landfill of dead bodies

898
00:29:22,538 --> 00:29:26,109
it looks like Vlad the Impaler has been

899
00:29:24,369 --> 00:29:27,459
around it's pretty interesting alright

900
00:29:26,109 --> 00:29:28,689
alright I just bought us a little bit

901
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:30,460
more time than if you saw me pushing

902
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:32,080
buttons on the phone no no let's see

903
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:33,548
we've done cover crop we've done so what

904
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:35,918
else you doing for pest management when

905
00:29:33,548 --> 00:29:37,388
you were mixing up we had Shawn on the

906
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:39,070
show a while back and he said to put the

907
00:29:37,388 --> 00:29:42,099
neem in the quraan Jameel in the soil

908
00:29:39,069 --> 00:29:45,220
would you do that or no um see I put

909
00:29:42,099 --> 00:29:48,308
Niemann karanji mill in the in the soil

910
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:50,710
for sure okay um but the Niemen that

911
00:29:48,308 --> 00:29:52,869
karanji oil is a little different you

912
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:54,610
know I blend it up so like that's how

913
00:29:52,869 --> 00:29:57,099
I'm getting it you know I'm putting it

914
00:29:54,609 --> 00:29:58,689
in a small little container with some

915
00:29:57,099 --> 00:30:00,339
warm water and I'm blending all that

916
00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:02,230
stuff up so it's getting really nice and

917
00:30:00,339 --> 00:30:04,089
mixed up turns to like a real nice you

918
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:06,519
know white mixture and now I'm pouring

919
00:30:04,089 --> 00:30:07,778
that into my water into my few gallons

920
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:09,038
and stuff like that just get it real

921
00:30:07,778 --> 00:30:10,869
nice and mixed up stuff like that with a

922
00:30:09,038 --> 00:30:16,509
blender stuff like that yeah just do my

923
00:30:10,869 --> 00:30:18,668
own shows a little ninja yeah yeah but

924
00:30:16,509 --> 00:30:21,669
ya know you can I put Neiman karanji

925
00:30:18,669 --> 00:30:24,340
mill you know Neiman karanji cake more

926
00:30:21,669 --> 00:30:28,690
or less I put a Neiman karanji cake on

927
00:30:24,339 --> 00:30:30,730
on as a top dressing for sure and kelp

928
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:32,169
and stuff like that it builds the fungi

929
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:33,819
so quick you'll just see like the

930
00:30:32,169 --> 00:30:36,100
mycelium just building like crazy all

931
00:30:33,819 --> 00:30:37,898
right you know by the time it gets into

932
00:30:36,099 --> 00:30:40,058
that white fur going you guys if you are

933
00:30:37,898 --> 00:30:41,829
going organics or no-till or super soil

934
00:30:40,058 --> 00:30:43,480
when you see that white fuzz it's good

935
00:30:41,829 --> 00:30:44,829
that's good yeah don't freak out people

936
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,940
like to be like oh it's moldy I gotta

937
00:30:44,829 --> 00:30:47,740
throw it away no that's what you're

938
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:49,450
aiming for yeah now white powder is the

939
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:50,769
start of life oh yeah if you got [ __ ]

940
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:52,929
growing on the dirt you're gonna grow a

941
00:30:50,769 --> 00:30:54,759
good shape from your dirt oh yeah yeah

942
00:30:52,929 --> 00:30:56,080
good [ __ ] yeah people don't get scared

943
00:30:54,759 --> 00:30:57,368
people don't understand what's happening

944
00:30:56,079 --> 00:30:58,569
and they get scared and then they throw

945
00:30:57,368 --> 00:31:00,548
their [ __ ] away I've seen it happen a

946
00:30:58,569 --> 00:31:01,659
few times I got to throw that [ __ ] away

947
00:31:00,548 --> 00:31:02,980
and I'm like

948
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:04,570
you want to go dig through there

949
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:06,579
wherever their dirt is and get it like I

950
00:31:04,569 --> 00:31:10,539
want that dirt man [ __ ] was awesome you

951
00:31:06,579 --> 00:31:12,639
just tossed it all all right so what are

952
00:31:10,539 --> 00:31:14,079
some common problems that people are

953
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,790
gonna run into if they try to start a

954
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:17,169
no-till garden what are the basic like

955
00:31:15,789 --> 00:31:20,319
the first issues these guys are gonna

956
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:23,350
run into I think trying to do too much a

957
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:25,689
lot of people come in and and if you've

958
00:31:23,349 --> 00:31:26,799
grown any other way even if you haven't

959
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:28,269
it's just like you're gonna take

960
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:31,359
pointers probably from people that have

961
00:31:28,269 --> 00:31:32,769
grown you know with bottles or even if

962
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:33,969
they've grown organically with bottles

963
00:31:32,769 --> 00:31:36,160
or something like that or supercilious

964
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:37,329
you're constantly having to do something

965
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,550
to the plants constantly have to do

966
00:31:37,329 --> 00:31:41,829

Boileau you go to a house without them

985
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:15,150
yeah I don't know they're frustrating

986
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:18,039
when you're trying to dab in your nose

987
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:20,200
yeah I was watching mr. doctor poof over

988
00:32:18,039 --> 00:32:21,460
here slap him out of the air and we said

989

your name a few times a couple of

990
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:24,100
minutes ago bro I wrote down the times

they're gonna try to do too much so the

998
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,300
easy way to solve that is just leave em

999
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:42,340
alone you guys there cannabis plants if

1000
00:32:40,299 --> 00:32:44,139
you want to do something do some super

1001
00:32:42,339 --> 00:32:45,669
cropping pop the stems a little bit it

1002
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:47,770
happens in Venice foliate a little bit

1003
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:49,450
yeah you see everybody like water too

1004
00:32:47,769 --> 00:32:51,879
much or do something in veg and stuff

1005
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:52,990
like that and you know just [ __ ] their

1006
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:54,640
plants out and stuff like that what you

1007
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:57,880
got to do you know in veg and stuff like

1008
00:32:54,640 --> 00:33:00,940
that water one time a week and watch how

1009
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:03,190
moist and wet that soil is you got mulch

1010
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:05,110
on top you got you know it's just so

1011
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:06,820
much happening stuff like that I mean at

1012
00:33:05,109 --> 00:33:09,459
the least you're gonna have a ten gallon

1013
00:33:06,819 --> 00:33:11,349
pot you know okay but you know I like to

1014
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:13,539
do 15 gallons stuff like that right now

1015
00:33:11,349 --> 00:33:14,319
the pots that I Kevin so like that we

1016
00:33:13,539 --> 00:33:16,240
have more 15

1017
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:19,148
we do toons there's a lot of 15-gallon

1018
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:21,038
stuff in there and they're going hard

1019
00:33:19,148 --> 00:33:22,538
man like I'm telling you dude like you

1020
00:33:21,038 --> 00:33:24,220
lift out the mulch and you see so much

1021
00:33:22,538 --> 00:33:26,109
life so many worms [ __ ] like that and I

1022
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:27,759
didn't buy worms like I didn't put these

1023
00:33:26,109 --> 00:33:30,519
worms in there you know now what about

1024
00:33:27,759 --> 00:33:31,960
keeping the life in the pots what about

1025
00:33:30,519 --> 00:33:35,649
people running into problems or their

1026
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:36,970
life leaving the pots I think again you

1027
00:33:35,648 --> 00:33:38,199
know it's just people trying to do too

1028
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:40,120
much people try and get in and want to

1029
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,450
do like these these mega T's and [ __ ]

1030
00:33:40,119 --> 00:33:42,158
like that

1031
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:44,200
I think the plant needs a lot you know

1032
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:45,820
they're trying to do like these you know

1033
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,470
Niemann kelp teas constantly and [ __ ]

1034
00:33:45,819 --> 00:33:48,878
like that and it's like you know I think

1035
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:50,620
you need to do NEMA couches you know

1036
00:33:48,878 --> 00:33:53,109
everyone swans stuff like that you need

1037
00:33:50,619 --> 00:33:54,878
to do a few compost teas but uh chill

1038
00:33:53,109 --> 00:33:56,829
out you know I mean let these things

1039
00:33:54,878 --> 00:33:58,658
breathe let them do their thing let this

1040
00:33:56,829 --> 00:34:01,569
ecosystem Eden how is someone going to

1041
00:33:58,659 --> 00:34:03,129
know that the inside of that ecosystem

1042
00:34:01,569 --> 00:34:05,138
has gone to [ __ ] how are they gonna be

1043
00:34:03,128 --> 00:34:07,028
able to tell I think you're playing or

1044
00:34:05,138 --> 00:34:09,398
just you have a problems not really well

1045
00:34:07,028 --> 00:34:11,019
it'll be going to fish it okay you seem

1046
00:34:09,398 --> 00:34:13,118
yellowing you'll see spots it'll get

1047
00:34:11,019 --> 00:34:14,619
crunchy it'll get droopy stuff like that

1048
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:17,500
Oh what do we do for cal-mag in this

1049
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:20,619
situation so you don't need calcium and

1050
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:22,449
magnesium stuff like that uh then the

1051
00:34:20,619 --> 00:34:24,429
cow mag and stuff like that is coming

1052
00:34:22,449 --> 00:34:25,868
from all I guess the trace minerals and

1053
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:27,970
stuff like that come from the neem and

1054
00:34:25,869 --> 00:34:29,769
stuff like that yeah there's a lot of

1055
00:34:27,969 --> 00:34:30,969
calcium there's a lot of magnesium

1056
00:34:29,769 --> 00:34:32,168
there's a lot of trace minerals all

1057
00:34:30,969 --> 00:34:35,108
through there and stuff like that I

1058
00:34:32,168 --> 00:34:36,848
think it's I think we're getting a lot

1059
00:34:35,108 --> 00:34:39,219
of different ways I'd have to look more

1060
00:34:36,849 --> 00:34:41,769
into where I am getting the calcium in

1061
00:34:39,219 --> 00:34:44,138
the magnesium for my plants but they're

1062
00:34:41,769 --> 00:34:45,789
going hard man and they stay green uh as

1063
00:34:44,139 --> 00:34:47,769
long as they're doing it yeah I can ask

1064
00:34:45,789 --> 00:34:49,750
questions that they look good yeah all

1065
00:34:47,769 --> 00:34:51,608
right you never see a cal-mag deficiency

1066
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:52,989
at all no we don't see no deficiencies

1067
00:34:51,608 --> 00:34:54,489
the only thing I see is you know

1068
00:34:52,989 --> 00:34:55,838
sometimes if a plants like directly

1069
00:34:54,489 --> 00:34:57,489
under a light you know sometimes it

1070
00:34:55,838 --> 00:34:58,960
wants more food and once more we'll see

1071
00:34:57,489 --> 00:35:00,250
what I do is I don't do a lot of teas

1072
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,750
and stuff everybody wants to do a lot of

1073
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:03,818
teas to feed their soul and stuff like

1074
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:05,920
that you know what Patrick sees me doing

1075
00:35:03,818 --> 00:35:07,989
what Patrick helps me do is uh we do a

1076
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:10,210
lot of top dressing and stuff like that

1077
00:35:07,989 --> 00:35:11,679
let the ecosystem break it down if

1078
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:14,500
you're trying to make a tea and bypass

1079
00:35:11,679 --> 00:35:15,848
the ecosystem the ecosystems gonna leave

1080
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:17,440
or go to sleep what the [ __ ] do they

1081
00:35:15,849 --> 00:35:19,420
need to be there for you know all right

1082
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:21,039
but if you're if you're over here you

1083
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:23,769
know doing it correctly and saying okay

1084
00:35:21,039 --> 00:35:24,639
let me figure out how much they need how

1085
00:35:23,769 --> 00:35:27,519
much each plant needs

1086
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:29,529
top dress them but the ecosystem comes

1087
00:35:27,519 --> 00:35:31,389
see what that is they're like oh nice we

1088
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:33,310
like this then they break it down and

1089
00:35:31,389 --> 00:35:35,170
they can use it correctly and stuff like

1090
00:35:33,309 --> 00:35:37,119
that they can break it down correctly

1091
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:38,619
you know quit trying to bypass them you

1092
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:40,299
know ecosystems gonna die what what does

1093
00:35:38,619 --> 00:35:43,179
your ecosystem need to be there for if

1094
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:44,380
you're gonna be the ecosystem let it

1095
00:35:43,179 --> 00:35:47,199
work itself that's what you set up

1096
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:48,700
no-till pots for stop doing please stop

1097
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:50,109
doing all these teas and [ __ ] like that

1098
00:35:48,699 --> 00:35:53,019
all right you guys you heard it from

1117
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:30,550
from a young age and I just mmm I'm more

1118
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:32,889
of a consider myself more of an agent

1119
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:36,280
and I like to represent people that I

1120
00:36:32,889 --> 00:36:38,170
believe in so before I really got into

1121
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:40,330
cannabis on the business end of the the

1122
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:44,409
deal I just really liked quality

1123
00:36:40,329 --> 00:36:48,039
cannabis then know exactly what made it

1124
00:36:44,409 --> 00:36:49,989
super quality but um I knew there was a

1125
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:52,570
difference between your average pot and

1126
00:36:49,989 --> 00:36:55,329
like some super chronic so I always have

1127
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:58,780
this one for wanting to figure out who

1128
00:36:55,329 --> 00:37:01,210
and how you ended up with super chronic

1129
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:04,960
weed versus just your average Joe pot

1130
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:06,400
and I've been blessed to be around and

1131
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:10,000
fortunate to be around people that have

1132

not to think about

1147
00:37:41,179 --> 00:37:44,389
like if I have a meeting with the bosses

1148
00:37:43,099 --> 00:37:45,650
or something I won't go in the grove for

1149
00:37:44,389 --> 00:37:47,239
a few minutes after that I'll try to

1150
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:49,340
keep all the investors or owners or

1151
00:37:47,239 --> 00:37:50,509
whoever out of those kinds of just keep

1152
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:51,890
them away from the plants a little bit

1153
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:53,060
and just let's just go to one area and

1154
00:37:51,889 --> 00:37:54,650

if your grow room is too hot or too cold

1169

grown some supreme pot I would say Verde

1223
00:40:07,099 --> 00:40:10,730
is doing a more of a living so they're

1224
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:12,199
not no - but they're you know they're

1225
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:14,809
they're real men during the soil and

1226
00:40:12,199 --> 00:40:16,159
just doing their thing Verdes very good

1227
00:40:14,809 --> 00:40:20,000
it's Chuck the lemon man still behind

1228
00:40:16,159 --> 00:40:21,858
Verde um I don't know man you'd have to

1229
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,239
see on there they're killing it though

1230
00:40:21,858 --> 00:40:24,528
they're doing good and stuff like that

1231
00:40:23,239 --> 00:40:26,328
but there's a few other note to a place

1232
00:40:24,528 --> 00:40:28,760
stuff like that and you know I mean it's

1233
00:40:26,329 --> 00:40:29,990
kind of yeah it's subpar stuff like that

1234
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:31,549
you don't know if they're spraying too

1235
00:40:29,989 --> 00:40:33,618
late I don't know they're spraying oil

1236
00:40:31,548 --> 00:40:34,788
you know sometimes they just don't smoke

1237
00:40:33,619 --> 00:40:36,318
correctly and stuff like that you know

1238
00:40:34,789 --> 00:40:38,180
I'm not gonna you know say any names but

1239
00:40:36,318 --> 00:40:40,849
you know just just people need to you

1240
00:40:38,179 --> 00:40:42,889
know appreciate really what they're what

1241
00:40:40,849 --> 00:40:44,240
they're doing with the plant stuff like

1242
00:40:42,889 --> 00:40:45,828
that and really think about the people

1243
00:40:44,239 --> 00:40:47,328
and stuff like that and think about you

1244
00:40:45,829 --> 00:40:49,548
know having a superior prior if you're

1245
00:40:47,329 --> 00:40:51,349
having my problems are having to spray

1246
00:40:49,548 --> 00:40:52,969
late in Flour and stuff like that crazy

1247
00:40:51,349 --> 00:40:55,670
Layton flower you're doing things

1248
00:40:52,969 --> 00:40:58,219
incorrectly exactly you know exactly and

1249
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:59,480
a spray isn't the solution problem is

1250
00:40:58,219 --> 00:41:01,278
the solution there's a better reason

1251
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:02,599
there's a you don't get a weird bump on

1252
00:41:01,278 --> 00:41:03,739
your face because you have a bump on

1253
00:41:02,599 --> 00:41:04,910
your face you get a weird bump on your

1254
00:41:03,739 --> 00:41:05,929
face because you wait too much sugar or

1255
00:41:04,909 --> 00:41:07,308
you got cancer

1256
00:41:05,929 --> 00:41:08,838
you got to research a little deeper you

1257
00:41:07,309 --> 00:41:09,619
got to stop eating the sugar you got to

1258
00:41:08,838 --> 00:41:11,150
get rid of the cancer

1259
00:41:09,619 --> 00:41:12,769
you got to solve the problem or the

1260
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:14,389
bumps gonna come back the mites are

1261

what's your favorite of your of your

1292
00:42:26,699 --> 00:42:30,839
hybrids that you created this wire

1293
00:42:28,789 --> 00:42:32,239
somebody asked me a question similar to

1294
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:35,430
that the other day and my favorites

1295
00:42:32,239 --> 00:42:37,289
probably whatever I haven't grown yet

1296
00:42:35,429 --> 00:42:39,480
that I've got seeds of those are always

1297
00:42:37,289 --> 00:42:41,610
just the new one yeah yeah about to

1298
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:43,650
germinate next night yeah like that's my

1299
00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:45,090
favorite right now ah there's some stuff

1300
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:48,389
I have bread that's never been grown

1301
00:42:45,090 --> 00:42:51,450
like Kim for to arise and platon well G

1302
00:42:48,389 --> 00:42:52,980
to arise Jack flash to arise that shit's

1303
00:42:51,449 --> 00:42:54,449
never been grown they're about nine

1304
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:57,869
strains that have never even been

1305
00:42:54,449 --> 00:42:59,039
plotted sounds pretty it's Spence's from

1306
00:42:57,869 --> 00:43:03,170
garden of Weeden that was the exact

1307
00:42:59,039 --> 00:43:03,170
extract Platinum cookies to the tangi

1308
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:10,140
nice but Kim for there's a lot of good

1309
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:11,639
ones can identity arise there's a lot of

1310
00:43:10,139 --> 00:43:13,170
good stuff in my vault that's never been

1311
00:43:11,639 --> 00:43:15,569
you ain't killing it yeah well thank you

1312
00:43:13,170 --> 00:43:17,130
yeah Rhys wants to put pollen on

1313
00:43:15,570 --> 00:43:18,390
everything and I'm kind of working on

1314
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:20,579
another breeding project here pretty

1315
00:43:18,389 --> 00:43:21,960
soon that we'll talk about in the future

1316
00:43:20,579 --> 00:43:23,909
I want to get it a little more underway

1317
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:26,670
and secured before a nice brag about

1318
00:43:23,909 --> 00:43:29,699
that it's good I want to get some some

1319
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:31,230
irony back in my garden I had some what

1320
00:43:29,699 --> 00:43:34,139
was that that cookie stomper that you

1321
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:35,610
yeah the King cookies yeah you know I

1322
00:43:34,139 --> 00:43:37,019
don't I had some good ones of those for

1323
00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:38,490
a while and stuff like that but you know

1324
00:43:37,019 --> 00:43:43,739
we ended up let them go just bringing in

1325
00:43:38,489 --> 00:43:45,839
so many strains and yeah no I think I

1326
00:43:43,739 --> 00:43:47,849
did of that no to like maybe once or

1327
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:49,140
twice okay you know maybe one or two

1328
00:43:47,849 --> 00:43:51,029
times but I'll still doing like some

1329
00:43:49,139 --> 00:43:52,619
super Souls and stuff like that super so

1330
00:43:51,030 --> 00:43:53,970
cool you just gotta you know just really

1331
00:43:52,619 --> 00:43:55,109
be feeding enzymes like [ __ ]

1332
00:43:53,969 --> 00:43:56,789
constantly just to speed up

1333
00:43:55,110 --> 00:43:58,500
decomposition because you know there's

1334
00:43:56,789 --> 00:43:59,730
no because there's no worms there's

1335
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:01,440
nothing eating it for you it's gotta

1336
00:43:59,730 --> 00:44:02,519
break down slowly by itself just a

1337
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:05,970
living story you got to feel a lot of

1338
00:44:02,519 --> 00:44:07,409
microbes histoy was so far along right

1339
00:44:05,969 --> 00:44:09,509
now as you can't its kind of not

1340
00:44:07,409 --> 00:44:11,730
comparable to like early or early

1341
00:44:09,510 --> 00:44:13,470
beginning stages of no-till like his

1342
00:44:11,730 --> 00:44:14,969
pots are taking care of themselves like

1343
00:44:13,469 --> 00:44:16,619
raising their I think they're super

1344
00:44:14,969 --> 00:44:18,419
filler last time you were here you said

1345
00:44:16,619 --> 00:44:20,279
you were on like round six or seven of

1346
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:20,820
your no-till pots yeah that's how long

1347
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:22,170
it's been

1348
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:24,600
been quite a while since we got here

1349
00:44:22,170 --> 00:44:27,059
yeah only the same dirt that's around

1350
00:44:24,599 --> 00:44:28,650
that are super far in the yeah yeah yeah

1351
00:44:27,059 --> 00:44:31,170
it's probably the same variance it's

1352
00:44:28,650 --> 00:44:33,380
crazy like all uh even topdressing stuff

1353
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:35,670
a lot and stuff like that and you know

1354
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:37,019
transplant and stuff like that I'll be

1355
00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:38,460
like man you know there's there's a lot

1356
00:44:37,019 --> 00:44:40,320
of dirt up here there's a there's a lot

1357
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:41,820
of you know mulch oh so like that these

1358
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:43,530
pots are over phones stuff like that

1359
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:45,180
before you know it then things are like

1360
00:44:43,530 --> 00:44:46,740
broken down the [ __ ] like that and

1361
00:44:45,179 --> 00:44:48,899
they're back like in the pot and stuff

1362
00:44:46,739 --> 00:44:50,729
yeah you know I mean it's it's crazy I'm

1363
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:52,470
scrolling to see Leah I mean it's crazy

1364
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:53,820
I have to constantly cut it and stuff

1365
00:44:52,469 --> 00:44:57,179
like that try and grow with the plants

1366
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:58,500
and stuff that's right you've got room

1367
00:44:57,179 --> 00:44:59,849
to germinate seeds man you let me know

1368
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:01,199
and I'll give you what my newest hottest

1369
00:44:59,849 --> 00:45:03,630
[ __ ] is yeah you get the fried

1370
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:05,099
appreciate that nunu yeah yeah yeah I

1371
00:45:03,630 --> 00:45:06,210
would like to spawn some big keepers and

1372
00:45:05,099 --> 00:45:08,429
stuff like that there's good and then

1373
00:45:06,210 --> 00:45:10,019
just bring me a clone and yeah we'll

1374
00:45:08,429 --> 00:45:12,089
keep it going I'm trying to do a little

1375
00:45:10,019 --> 00:45:13,769
fake the little few crosses of my own

1376
00:45:12,090 --> 00:45:17,010
and stuff like that you know just trying

1377
00:45:13,769 --> 00:45:22,409
to you know do some you know some few

1378
00:45:17,010 --> 00:45:23,940
branches I would even like some pollen

1379
00:45:22,409 --> 00:45:25,469
or something definitely so I can just

1380
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:27,269
hit a few Brent take a plane now hit a

1381
00:45:25,469 --> 00:45:28,649
few branches of stuff like that spray it

1382
00:45:27,269 --> 00:45:30,840
down and stuff like that and put it back

1383
00:45:28,650 --> 00:45:33,090
in yep you know you got to do basically

1384
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:35,370
there's get those few branches and stuff

1385
00:45:33,090 --> 00:45:36,120
like that of those seasons good pollen

1386
00:45:35,369 --> 00:45:46,109
is the hard part

1387
00:45:36,119 --> 00:45:49,049
yeah we would like some good work so

1388
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:51,090
there may be some some IRA Frost collabs

1389
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:53,490
here in the future that would be you

1390
00:45:51,090 --> 00:45:55,260
know frozen mountain genetics or some

1391
00:45:53,489 --> 00:45:56,939
[ __ ] hey I brought that glue out here

1392
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:59,160
man I got that gorilla glue from some

1393
00:45:56,940 --> 00:46:01,139
guys that uh literally knew Josie Wells

1394
00:45:59,159 --> 00:46:03,329
in the mountain Avada back then and uh

1395
00:46:01,139 --> 00:46:04,650
my buddy Gary gave it to me back in

1396
00:46:03,329 --> 00:46:08,250
college I'm talking about we had this

1397
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:10,710
thing like 2010 2011 dude we've kept

1398
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:12,300
this gorilla glue this long so you can

1399
00:46:10,710 --> 00:46:14,579
talk about how long that is yeah yeah

1400
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:16,620
I've had my flow cut since I think 2008

1401
00:46:14,579 --> 00:46:18,329
or seven that's that Colorado flow

1402
00:46:16,619 --> 00:46:19,799
though yeah yeah a lot of you have some

1403
00:46:18,329 --> 00:46:21,569
boof flows and [ __ ] now I don't know

1404
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:23,070
where all these you know poopy ass and

1405
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:25,920
[ __ ] flows came from I think it's

1406
00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:27,930
like something sister what's the one

1407
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:29,880
that's real so yes there is

1408
00:46:27,929 --> 00:46:31,019
I think a lot of people have that and

1409
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:32,730
it's just like they're calling it

1410
00:46:31,019 --> 00:46:34,920
flowing it's just not the flow man yeah

1411
00:46:32,730 --> 00:46:36,480
that Colorado flow is it almost gives

1412
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:38,400
you like an indica high it's real sweet

1413
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:41,519
and real [ __ ] it's like it's real

1414
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:43,200
sweet tart og type right yeah incense

1415
00:46:41,519 --> 00:46:45,750
and hippie feet kind of a smell going on

1416
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:47,788
yeah yeah yeah I'd love it this is not

1417
00:46:45,750 --> 00:46:51,480
like like a like a piney like kinda has

1418
00:46:47,789 --> 00:46:53,309
a piney you - yeah I do not like there's

1419
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:54,719
also plenty of things I do like it was

1420
00:46:53,309 --> 00:46:56,220
nice back in the day I remember like I

1421
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:58,409
had the Colorado flow way back in the

1422
00:46:56,219 --> 00:47:00,239
day it was good I still have that cut my

1423
00:46:58,409 --> 00:47:01,618
came from you yeah possibly probably

1424
00:47:00,239 --> 00:47:03,719
came from pretty dry so it was Spencer

1425
00:47:01,619 --> 00:47:05,608
like they had probably started yeah yeah

1426
00:47:03,719 --> 00:47:07,769
sure that cut a lot yeah it makes so

1427
00:47:05,608 --> 00:47:09,598
much great clones yeah [ __ ] you cut

1428
00:47:07,769 --> 00:47:13,559
it it's got roots heals really well too

1429
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:15,750
right yeah it turns purple and stink so

1430

piff over here so it's just like I'm

1435
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:30,480
trying to grow some strings I don't

1436
00:47:28,199 --> 00:47:32,879
really have to yeah we got a lot of new

1437
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:34,528
age genetics I would say you know I mean

1438
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:37,079
we got some orange cream yeah we got

1439
00:47:34,528 --> 00:47:39,028
some solid like oh geez that are

1440
00:47:37,079 --> 00:47:41,460
definitely staple stones that would

1441
00:47:39,028 --> 00:47:43,559
never be old but we got a we got some

1442
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:45,990
like orange cream and the white Tahoe

1443
00:47:43,559 --> 00:47:47,849
cookies and the papaya and like some

1444
00:47:45,989 --> 00:47:50,189
stuff that is just like really sought

1445
00:47:47,849 --> 00:47:52,318
after you know like terpene wise yeah I

1446
00:47:50,190 --> 00:47:53,880
guess nugs I hear a lot about the papaya

1447
00:47:52,318 --> 00:47:57,028
yeah I don't have any experience with

1448
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:59,160
the papaya papaya yeah go ahead and

1449
00:47:57,028 --> 00:48:01,318
throw that on the [ __ ] air real

1450
00:47:59,159 --> 00:48:03,179
quick I'll shoot Jeff the papaya at the

1451
00:48:01,318 --> 00:48:05,190
papaya in house [ __ ] what do you call

1452
00:48:03,179 --> 00:48:07,019
a rise to papaya that's the new question

1453
00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:08,940
do this it's really good it throws like

1454
00:48:07,019 --> 00:48:10,079
so even in the notes and so like that

1455
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:11,670
that's the best thing that I found out

1456
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:13,970
with note is you know it allows the

1457
00:48:11,670 --> 00:48:16,099
plants to really express all their own

1458
00:48:13,969 --> 00:48:18,568
yeah we were talking earlier before

1459
00:48:16,099 --> 00:48:20,309
there's a certain nutrient brand that if

1460
00:48:18,568 --> 00:48:21,869
you feed your plants that nutrient brand

1461
00:48:20,309 --> 00:48:26,160
if you grow ten strains it looks like

1462
00:48:21,869 --> 00:48:27,750
you grew one stream [ __ ] yeah you want

1463
00:48:26,159 --> 00:48:30,568
that and it's equivalent with the high I

1464
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:33,269
mean it transitions hand for hand right

1465
00:48:30,568 --> 00:48:34,440
when when you smoke no tell you I mean

1466
00:48:33,269 --> 00:48:36,449
if you're smoking something's gonna

1467
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:37,829
wreck you you're gonna get wrecked and

1468
00:48:36,449 --> 00:48:39,480
it's not like there's a ceiling on it

1469
00:48:37,829 --> 00:48:40,859
like that you top out

1470
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:41,969
I'm there when he's getting higher yeah

1471
00:48:40,858 --> 00:48:44,460
like you're just gonna keep getting

1472
00:48:41,969 --> 00:48:45,719
stoned I think it's just more pure that

1473
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:47,429
that one time whenever you said that

1474
00:48:45,719 --> 00:48:49,139
there was all kinds of trichomes caked

1475
00:48:47,429 --> 00:48:51,269
on the weed like extra caked on the weed

1476
00:48:49,139 --> 00:48:53,099
I think whenever y'all use these

1477
00:48:51,269 --> 00:48:55,289
synthetics and stuff like that or even

1478
00:48:53,099 --> 00:48:56,880
just like you know organic synthetics or

1479
00:48:55,289 --> 00:48:58,949
whatever just a bottle stuff like that

1480
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:01,500
that is a synthesized nutrient nothing

1481
00:48:58,949 --> 00:49:03,449
is building calyx is so big and it's

1482
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:05,489
building trichomes so big they're like

1483
00:49:03,449 --> 00:49:06,539
these trichomes but you know I mean it's

1484
00:49:05,489 --> 00:49:08,519
good for extracting sure like that

1485
00:49:06,539 --> 00:49:10,409
you're getting huge trichomes like that

1486
00:49:08,519 --> 00:49:12,809
I think we aren't getting this big of

1487
00:49:10,409 --> 00:49:14,699
trichomes okay we're getting more

1488
00:49:12,809 --> 00:49:15,119
trichomes all right you see what I'm

1489
00:49:14,699 --> 00:49:16,679
saying

1490
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:18,030
like it's just caked up like it's just

1491
00:49:16,679 --> 00:49:19,829
like a whole bunch of a little fire a

1492
00:49:18,030 --> 00:49:21,960
strike on just caked up more natural

1493
00:49:19,829 --> 00:49:24,690
type of like trichomes stuff like that I

1494
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:26,579
say our Terps or more you know prevalent

1495
00:49:24,690 --> 00:49:28,349
than any type of bottle and stuff like

1496
00:49:26,579 --> 00:49:30,150
that like definitely so especially when

1497
00:49:28,349 --> 00:49:32,400
you get it down into bag form not even

1498
00:49:30,150 --> 00:49:34,260
not even an extract on that for sure

1499
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:37,019
it's probably definitely so but when you

1500
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:39,510
get it down to a bag form I think soil

1501
00:49:37,019 --> 00:49:41,429
grown weed is just so much louder like

1502
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:43,619
it finds your nose versus you going to

1503
00:49:41,429 --> 00:49:45,779
find the smell Terps for days you know

1504
00:49:43,619 --> 00:49:47,369
we all love the Terps yeah what it's all

1505
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:49,170
about nowadays yeah Terps are what drive

1506
00:49:47,369 --> 00:49:50,700
the hide the THC makes you grow up if I

1507
00:49:49,170 --> 00:49:51,960
have to decide how you're gonna get

1508
00:49:50,699 --> 00:49:53,549
there you're gonna get the munchies

1509
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:55,108
you're gonna get a high high you're

1510
00:49:53,550 --> 00:49:58,440
