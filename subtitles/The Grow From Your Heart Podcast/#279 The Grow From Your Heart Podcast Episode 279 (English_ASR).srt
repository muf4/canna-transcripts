else we gonna talk about you guys

73
00:02:37,979 --> 00:02:41,649
remember I talked a couple of weeks ago

74
00:02:39,789 --> 00:02:43,750
about getting sick ever since I got sick

75
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:46,810
when I take dad's I have just been

76
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:48,909
getting rekt high like holy [ __ ] I

77
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:50,620
probably smoked half as much hash in the

78
00:02:48,909 --> 00:02:52,959
past few days as I used to before I got

79
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:54,849
sick and I just had this killer chest

80
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,319
cold and a head cold everybody at the

81
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:58,329
Grove got it passed around everybody

82
00:02:56,318 --> 00:03:00,549
around here got sick but since then I've

83
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:01,959
just been able to get stupid high just

84
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:04,689
off of a couple of dads it's been kind

85
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:06,520
of nice it's um it's kind of not also

86
00:03:04,689 --> 00:03:08,079
because my friends be here's a big-ass

87
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,340
dad and I'll take anybody on I just

88
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,599
gotta sit here for 10 minutes and

89
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:13,000
figured my [ __ ] life out again

90
00:03:10,598 --> 00:03:14,649
there's been getting lit off dad's

91
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,120
lately it's kind of nice I don't know if

92
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:17,590
it's got anything to do with when I was

93
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,120
sick or if I'm eating a little

94
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:20,289
differently because I got sick and you

95
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,219
know when you get sick you try to be a

96
00:03:20,289 --> 00:03:23,049
little more healthy you start eating

97
00:03:21,219 --> 00:03:24,159
better got sick I better eat more fruit

98
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:24,760
and cut out all the crap so I'm doing

99
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,019
that again

100
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:27,370
maybe that's got something to do with it

101
00:03:26,019 --> 00:03:29,709
but holy crap I've been getting lit up

102
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:31,360
by him and getting red again and it's

103
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:33,729
pretty nice another thing I want to

104
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,260
mention my favorite rig got real dirty

105
00:03:33,729 --> 00:03:37,060
so I switched over to an even smaller

106
00:03:35,259 --> 00:03:38,859
rig I'm hitting the hitman phase 2 it's

107
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:40,930
a little tiny rig the phase 2 with the

108
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:42,340
thermal banger I really like the small

109
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:44,769
rigs you guys I see a lot of people

110
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:47,379
smoking out of big gigantic dab rigs why

111
00:03:44,769 --> 00:03:48,459
there's no need for that a bong when

112
00:03:47,379 --> 00:03:50,169
you're smoking a bong your turn to fill

113
00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:52,120
all that glass space that that whole

114
00:03:50,169 --> 00:03:53,708
chamber with smoke so that when you pull

115
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,239
it you get this big old blast of smoke

116
00:03:53,709 --> 00:03:56,799
whoa and then you choke and your eyes

117
00:03:55,239 --> 00:03:58,120
turn red it's [ __ ] awesome right you

118
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,680
got a big old bong rip when you're

119
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,599
taking a DAB I don't want to smoke a

120
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,069
liter of oxygen before my dad gets to me

121
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:04,840
I want to heat the nail I want to let it

122
00:04:03,068 --> 00:04:06,159
get still tore it's a little bit too hot

123
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,360
for most people I like my dad's hot you

124
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,039
guys I'm sorry that's how I like it I do

125
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,959
it people talk [ __ ] but I'm a hot bad

126
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:12,098
smoker I'll get tourists just a little

127
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,620
bit too hot then I put my dab in there

128
00:04:12,098 --> 00:04:16,298
then I cap it and then that dab goes

129
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:17,798
from the nail through the water poof

130
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:19,538
into my head Wow

131
00:04:17,798 --> 00:04:21,279
that's just like a punch to the face I

132
00:04:19,538 --> 00:04:22,629
feel like there's no need for all the

133
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:24,668
air I just need some bubbles to

134
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:26,620
percolate and cool down the wall down

135
00:04:24,668 --> 00:04:28,209
the smoke a little bit before I get some

136
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:29,319
I throw because it'll burn your throat

137
00:04:28,209 --> 00:04:31,029
if you don't cool it now I don't like to

138
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:32,620
smoke dabs out of something without

139
00:04:31,029 --> 00:04:34,929
water and get some water filtration some

140
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:36,629
bubbles but I like straight from the

141
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:38,680
nail through the water do the mouthpiece

142
00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:40,990
punch me in the head that's where I want

143
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,939
my dad ah you guys are smoking out of

144
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:45,129

00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:24,129
poor

165
00:05:22,779 --> 00:05:25,419
well I really love the shape and

166
00:05:24,129 --> 00:05:27,129
structure and the aroma that comes from

167
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:30,280
that mail if flowers in a great amount

168
00:05:27,129 --> 00:05:31,569
of time I makes trichomes I'd really

169
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:34,750
like this mail plant it makes great

170
00:05:31,569 --> 00:05:37,089
progeny so I have pollinated the star

171
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:38,889
dog the durbin poison platinum tangi and

172
00:05:37,089 --> 00:05:42,519
a couple of their select females with

173
00:05:38,889 --> 00:05:43,860
this arise today is day 45 of flowering

174
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:47,319
for those plants they got pollinated

175
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:50,319
about 25 days into flower so they will

176
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:52,540
be ready uh and whatsits got 45 days we

177
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:54,219
got about 15 maybe 20 25 days until

178
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:55,780
those seeds are ready we'll chop down

179
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:57,340
the plants well first we'll cut off all

180
00:05:55,779 --> 00:05:58,569
the big leaves chop down the plants that

181
00:05:57,339 --> 00:06:00,250
I'm hanging upside down and dry then

182
00:05:58,569 --> 00:06:01,240
we'll cut them into smaller pieces then

183
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,470
I'll crunch them up into a little

184
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:04,060
Tupperware dish and get all the seeds

185
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:06,370
out and then I'll grow a bunch of those

186
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:09,189
and see what I have created honestly I'm

187
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:11,019
pretty excited Starr dog is a great

188
00:06:09,189 --> 00:06:13,389
commercial strain it's a great yield er

189
00:06:11,019 --> 00:06:14,168
it makes a nice rock hard dense buds it

190
00:06:13,389 --> 00:06:16,930
smells real good

191
00:06:14,168 --> 00:06:18,789
it takes amazing photos I love the smoke

192
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:20,650
and the flavor it's got a nice head high

193
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:22,750
to it it does what I want from medicine

194
00:06:20,649 --> 00:06:25,389
so I think crossing it to the arise

195
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:27,189
which also smells good tastes good it

196
00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:28,959
does this I think when I smoke it arise

197
00:06:27,189 --> 00:06:30,279
makes my eyes feel real heavy and I miss

198
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:31,599
that in weed a lot of the new weed

199
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:34,299
doesn't have the I hide that the old

200
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,220
weed had and it's got that so I like

201
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:38,590
that I think by crossing the two I

202
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:40,960
should really make some I'm hoping to

203
00:06:38,589 --> 00:06:43,539
improve the harvests of the star dog I'm

204
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:45,009
hoping to put that that arise vigor into

205
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:46,960
the star dog I'm hoping to get that

206
00:06:45,009 --> 00:06:48,639
cushy smell I'm hoping to get a lot of

207
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:51,189
trichomes I'm hoping to get a lot of THC

208
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,329
I look forward to that one a la Durbin

209
00:06:51,189 --> 00:06:53,469
poison was the other one that I was

210
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:55,659
excited about him just dabbing the

211
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:57,760
Durbin poison live resin I loved the

212
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:59,560
flavor of Durbin poison you guys the

213
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,240
flavor is amazing but also the high from

214
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:03,189
Durbin poison that sativa head thing

215
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:04,600
that it does a lot of people if you

216
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:06,160
would have smoked as much Durbin poison

217
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,050
hashes I just smoked the live resin I

218
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,490
just call all concentrates hash if you

219
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:11,290
were to smoked as much Durbin poison

220
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:12,579
live resin as I just smoked that most

221
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:14,260
people would be kind of in like a

222
00:07:12,579 --> 00:07:15,519
panicky state or like a weird trippy

223
00:07:14,259 --> 00:07:16,478
state but it makes me just right I

224
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:18,189
really love it it makes me a little

225
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:20,259
talkative but I'm drinking a Dr Pepper

226
00:07:18,189 --> 00:07:21,910
and having some sativa dad's I'm trying

227
00:07:20,259 --> 00:07:25,300
to be talkative but I just love the

228
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:26,740
Durbin poison the Durbin poison ah it's

229
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:29,470
a little lanky in the grow it could be

230
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:30,939
better so I'm hoping to improve the

231
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:33,130
structure and prove the harvests and

232
00:07:30,939 --> 00:07:35,949
take that flavor into something that I

233
00:07:33,129 --> 00:07:36,699
can pass along and maybe find a cushier

234
00:07:35,949 --> 00:07:38,019
Durbin

235
00:07:36,699 --> 00:07:40,149
sort of a flavor I just want to see what

236
00:07:38,019 --> 00:07:41,649
I can do with it I'm gonna grow a bunch

237
00:07:40,149 --> 00:07:42,669
of those and then we'll see where that

238
00:07:41,649 --> 00:07:44,709
goes from there of course the Platinum

239
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:45,879
tangi that's gonna make just oranges I'm

240
00:07:44,709 --> 00:07:47,639
hoping that everything just tastes like

241
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:49,540
oranges and it's covered in Tri cones

242
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:51,639
Spence and Maddie from the garden of

243
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:53,770
Weeden bred the Platinum tangi that I've

244
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:55,629
got and they nailed it it's a perfect

245
00:07:53,769 --> 00:07:58,240
plant it tastes amazing it grows very

246
00:07:55,629 --> 00:08:00,189
well but it's small it stays short and

247
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,810
[ __ ] and it doesn't yield enough so by

248
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:04,149
putting the bigger rise mail to it I'm

249
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:05,949
hoping to just increase the size of that

250
00:08:04,149 --> 00:08:07,839
plant is my main goal I want to bring

251
00:08:05,949 --> 00:08:08,920
the orange flavor I want to increase the

252
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:10,959
resin and I want to make the plant

253
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,730
bigger it's my main goal there I'm super

254
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:14,560
excited about those so this is the part

255
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:18,759

recent review this one came from a

337
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,190
person who their iTunes handle his

338
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,519
lunchbox 3 which I like really well but

339
00:10:56,190 --> 00:11:01,170
they say I go by chronic Coby they were

340
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,549
kind enough to give me a 5 star review

341
00:11:01,169 --> 00:11:04,379
and it goes like this

342
00:11:02,549 --> 00:11:05,939
I recently started growing this year and

343
00:11:04,379 --> 00:11:08,189

00:11:21,059 --> 00:11:24,569
aspect about cannabis from state laws to

354
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:27,240
tips on growing I've done a fair amount

355
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:29,040
of research to familiar my familiarize

356
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:31,049
myself with the basics and being able to

357
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:32,819
hear you touch on them again and such a

358
00:11:31,049 --> 00:11:35,549
thorough manner was extremely helpful

359
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:39,300
hey man that means a lot to me I'm glad

360

361
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:42,539
your research and that we are matching

362
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:44,130
up and I'm kind of reaffirming the

363
00:11:42,539 --> 00:11:46,139
things that you read so it's always nice

364
00:11:44,129 --> 00:11:47,730
to have some affirmation so I'm glad I

365
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:49,799
could do that for you let me see where I

366
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:51,810
was also I really enjoy how you keep the

367
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:54,000
mood a good balance between serious and

368
00:11:51,809 --> 00:11:55,649
funny yes we got to be funny I love

369
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,320
comedy I hang out with a bunch of

370
00:11:55,649 --> 00:12:00,600
smartass people I was raised by a long

371
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,220
line of professional smart asses so I do

372
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,540
like to be kind of funny sometimes

373
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,980
sometimes it just comes

374
00:12:03,539 --> 00:12:07,259
accidentally and naturally in the show

375
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:09,028
so I'm glad you appreciate that I feel

376
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:10,709
like keeping it fun helps people learn I

377
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:12,120
always had more fun in school when I was

378
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:13,528
laughing and my teacher was actually

379
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,509
being cool and not being a dick and just

380
00:12:13,528 --> 00:12:17,698
forcing useless information down my

381
00:12:15,509 --> 00:12:19,169
throat so thanks for enjoying the

382
00:12:17,698 --> 00:12:20,578
balance between serious and funny and

383
00:12:19,169 --> 00:12:22,349
thanks for finding me funny I'm sure

384

of random lately I've fallen in love

403
00:12:56,039 --> 00:12:59,009
with the podcast they haven't put out a

404

the scales with Tom Marshall yes I am a

407
00:13:02,909 --> 00:13:07,169
big silly fish fan I am in love with the

408
00:13:05,578 --> 00:13:10,138
band of fish I've seen fish a lot of

409
00:13:07,169 --> 00:13:11,729
times I love fish the music of fish the

410
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:13,560
sound of Trey's guitar the sound of

411
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:15,300
Paige's keyboards the way

412
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:16,859
Fishman plays the drums the way mic

413

don'ts the bass it's all just [ __ ]

414
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:20,759
magical the way it all happens to me

415
00:13:18,179 --> 00:13:23,099
that is my favorite band there the guy

416
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:25,470
that writes a lot of their lyrics is not

417
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:27,180
in the band but he is closely connected

418
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:30,149
with the band he has made a podcast

419
00:13:27,179 --> 00:13:32,849

think I'm 12 episodes in now I won't

423
00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:41,490
listen to another podcast until I finish

424
00:13:39,389 --> 00:13:42,690
every episode of this one I feel I may

425
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:44,459
have to take a break just did not hear

426

430
00:13:49,769 --> 00:13:53,120
two episodes back to back where they

431
00:13:51,149 --> 00:13:56,339
interviewed Trey about his guitars

432
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:58,560
hearing Trey talk about his relationship

433
00:13:56,339 --> 00:14:01,319
with Paul the guy that built his guitars

434
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:03,929
and how Paul became a guitar builder and

435
00:14:01,318 --> 00:14:05,610

00:15:46,899 --> 00:15:50,589
obtained by the cannabis things are a

489
00:15:49,179 --> 00:15:52,508
little different here an assistant

490
00:15:50,589 --> 00:15:54,430
manager alleged allegedly told the

491
00:15:52,509 --> 00:15:57,879
employee during his first work shift at

492
00:15:54,429 --> 00:16:00,250
26 47 West 38th Avenue you'll get used

493
00:15:57,879 --> 00:16:01,799
to the loopers so with the old location

494
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:03,970
where this employee allegedly worked

495
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:06,448
they didn't allow looping but when they

496
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:08,769
moved them to this location allegedly

497
00:16:06,448 --> 00:16:10,328
one of the employees told them you'll

498
00:16:08,769 --> 00:16:12,308
get used to the loopers now let me tell

499
00:16:10,328 --> 00:16:14,109
you what loopers are really quickly in a

500
00:16:12,308 --> 00:16:16,269
dispensary in Colorado a recreational

501
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:18,188
dispensary a customer is allowed to

502
00:16:16,269 --> 00:16:20,980
purchase seven grams of cannabis per

503
00:16:18,188 --> 00:16:22,778
transaction now that there is been a

504
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:24,399
loophole found where per transaction

505
00:16:22,778 --> 00:16:26,139
means you can walk out the door

506
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:27,370
drive your car around the building go

507
00:16:26,139 --> 00:16:29,500
back in the door and make another

508
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:31,029
transaction and you can buy seven more

509
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:32,409
grams now there was a

510
00:16:31,029 --> 00:16:34,059
memo sent out by the marijuana

511
00:16:32,409 --> 00:16:36,189
Enforcement Division saying hey

512
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:39,069
dispensaries that's [ __ ] stop doing

513
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:40,750
that now they kept doing it now that's

514
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:41,890
looping that is looping and it was made

515
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:44,259
clear that it can't be done

516
00:16:41,889 --> 00:16:45,639
looping is when you just returned or a

517
00:16:44,259 --> 00:16:47,230
lot of people like to go to different

518
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:48,370
dispensaries which is that's cool

519
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:49,930
because that doesn't look like [ __ ]

520
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:51,279
you're not just going back it go

521
00:16:49,929 --> 00:16:52,539
different dispensary it makes you not

522
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,860
look so shitty but they're going to

523
00:16:52,539 --> 00:16:55,870
implement a tracking system

524
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:57,129
I bet because of stuff like this let me

525
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:59,019
continue with the article and stop

526
00:16:57,129 --> 00:17:00,490
assuming things the article says the

527
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:01,870
affidavit one of several file does

528
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:03,759
request research warrants in the case

529
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:05,500
provides some glimpses into the

530
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:07,089
year-long investigation of alleged

531
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:09,339
illegal marijuana sales at the

532
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:11,679
denver-based sweetleaf chain the

533
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:13,449
investigation which is ongoing zeroed in

534
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,980
on alleged incidents of looping in which

535
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:17,049
individuals would make repeated

536
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:19,390
purchases of one ounce of recreational

537
00:17:17,049 --> 00:17:21,430
marijuana oh I said seven grams Hunt

538
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:23,259
announced I'm sorry the maximum allowed

539
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:25,990
for purchase and possession per Colorado

540
00:17:23,259 --> 00:17:27,309
law several times a day so they would go

541
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:30,220
back several times and buy several

542
00:17:27,309 --> 00:17:31,929
ounces no I did [ __ ] up and say seven

543
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:33,759
grams but when we originally started

544
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:35,049
recreational cannabis in Colorado seven

545
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:37,000
grams was the limit that out-of-state

546
00:17:35,049 --> 00:17:38,559
folks were allowed to buy and they

547
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,089
quickly increase that once they realize

548
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,289
people were just shopping around and

549
00:17:40,089 --> 00:17:43,209
going place to place they're trying to

550
00:17:41,289 --> 00:17:46,149
slow that down but now they sell them an

551
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:47,769
ounce and an ounce if you were from out

552
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:49,420
of state you're visiting here an ounce

553
00:17:47,769 --> 00:17:51,099
is plenty of weed for you to have on you

554
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:52,539
and just be smoking if you're smoking

555
00:17:51,099 --> 00:17:54,069
more than an ounce a day you got to have

556
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:56,049
a lot of people with you you got to be a

557
00:17:54,069 --> 00:17:57,519
heavy heavy smoker or it looks

558
00:17:56,049 --> 00:17:59,559
suspicious and you're doing something if

559
00:17:57,519 --> 00:18:01,809
you're buying four or five eight ounces

560
00:17:59,559 --> 00:18:03,190
at a time something's happening so let

561
00:18:01,809 --> 00:18:04,480
me continue with the last paragraph of

562
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:06,460
this article here and we'll wrap up this

563
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,559
update it says on December 14th police

564
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:10,480
raided several Denver area sweetleaf

565
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:13,240
locations executing search warrants and

566
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:15,130
arresting thirteen bud tenders employees

567
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:16,960
involved in the sale of marijuana then

568
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:18,280
here's the final part as of Thursday ten

569
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,090
employees have been charged with either

570
00:18:18,279 --> 00:18:24,129
misdemeanor or felony distribution of

571
00:18:21,089 --> 00:18:25,389
marijuana so thirteen were arrested only

572
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:27,310
ten have been charged

573
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:28,780
there is another article attached to

574
00:18:27,309 --> 00:18:31,089
this and it says attorney for sweet leaf

575
00:18:28,779 --> 00:18:31,750
bud tenders files to dismiss felony

576
00:18:31,089 --> 00:18:33,490
charges

577
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:35,470
the article is fairly long but there is

578
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:37,779
a part in here that I wanted to share it

579
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:39,250
says that the the sweet leaf employees

580
00:18:37,779 --> 00:18:41,109
and it lists a bunch of names who were

581
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:42,609
each charged with felony distribution of

582
00:18:41,109 --> 00:18:44,250
marijuana more than four ounces

583
00:18:42,609 --> 00:18:46,859
acted within the bounds

584
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:48,359
of state law their attorney Robert J

585
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:51,479
Corey wrote in a court motion filed

586
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:53,250
Thursday to dismiss the charges the

587
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:55,890
article also states that amendment 64

588
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:57,569
the 2012 voter approved approved ballot

589
00:18:55,890 --> 00:19:00,390
measure legalizing adult use marijuana

590
00:18:57,569 --> 00:19:01,950
sales establishes threshold immunity

591
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:03,750
from criminal protection

592
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:05,309
Robert Corey claim the Colorado

593
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:07,349
Constitution allows for adults to

594
00:19:05,309 --> 00:19:09,419
possess one ounce or fewer of marijuana

595
00:19:07,349 --> 00:19:11,789
in additions to actions such as

596
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:13,560
transferring of one ounce or under to

597
00:19:11,789 --> 00:19:15,869
another adult as well as assisting

598
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:17,700
another adult Corey roe those and other

599
00:19:15,869 --> 00:19:20,459
personal rights included in legalization

600
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:23,069
amendment 64 specifically in muna

601
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:26,549
immunizes actions taken by marijuana

602
00:19:23,069 --> 00:19:28,230
establishments Corey added so it looks

603
00:19:26,549 --> 00:19:29,940
like they've got a good lawyer they were

604
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:31,710
trying to get the charges dismissed a

605
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:33,330
lot of people think that this was just

606
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:35,220
kind of a wake up call by the meed

607
00:19:33,329 --> 00:19:36,779
saying hey we see people doing things

608
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:38,220

609

649
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:03,710
more THC I wrote a little piece about

650

what's the podcasts gonna be about and I

653
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:10,549
said it's gonna be Airy buds and a

654
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,710
couple of my friends instantly said [ __ ]

655
00:21:10,549 --> 00:21:14,720
Airy buds I everyone's allowed to their

656
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:17,150
own opinion so I asked politely

657
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:19,759
why [ __ ] Carrie buds the answers I got

658
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:21,890
were they're terrible to trim yes Airy

659
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:25,009
buds do suck the trim that is very true

660
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:27,500
the other answer was zero bag appeal

661
00:21:25,009 --> 00:21:29,240
which is kind of true other than it

662
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:30,829
makes your bud your bag look huge but

663
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:32,720
everybody wants those little rocks

664
00:21:30,829 --> 00:21:35,210
everybody wants those cushy tight

665
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:37,579
compacted buds everybody wants not Airy

666
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:39,319
but they want dense buds they want a

667
00:21:37,579 --> 00:21:40,849
nice fat looking bag of weed they want

668
00:21:39,319 --> 00:21:42,950
some cream and some purple maybe some

669
00:21:40,849 --> 00:21:44,959
orange in there ah that's that's what

670
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:47,450
people are looking for not fluffy crappy

671
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,920
shitty trim - lookin weed so somebody

672
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:54,620
the first question that started this was

673
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:56,029
do airy buds have more THC ah maybe that

674
00:21:54,619 --> 00:21:57,469
depends on the genetics that depends on

675
00:21:56,029 --> 00:22:00,349
your stream that depends on the grower I

676
00:21:57,470 --> 00:22:03,380
don't think more THC because it's Airy

677
00:22:00,349 --> 00:22:05,449
is a thing what is possible however is

678
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:07,910
there is more surface area of an airy

679
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:10,910
bud so that may allow for more room for

680
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:14,570
more trichomes because that is where the

681
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:16,430
oils the THC are contained so there are

682
00:22:14,569 --> 00:22:18,019
more put your hand in a fist hold your

683
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:20,750
hand in a fist in front of you now

684
00:22:18,019 --> 00:22:23,539
imagine if I were to coat your fist and

685
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:24,859
trichomes you've got a fist covered in

686
00:22:23,539 --> 00:22:26,809
Tricon dry you can be convinced that

687
00:22:24,859 --> 00:22:29,119
your hand is covered in trichomes now

688
00:22:26,809 --> 00:22:31,309
open your hand now look at all the space

689
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:32,750
that would have been missed by those

690
00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:33,980
trichomes if we had just coated your

691
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:36,529
hand and trichomes well you had a fist

692
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:38,299
now if you've got an airy bud that is

693
00:22:36,529 --> 00:22:40,039
open like your hand you've got that much

694
00:22:38,299 --> 00:22:41,509
more surface area to put trichomes

695
00:22:40,039 --> 00:22:43,740
another way you could think about it

696
00:22:41,509 --> 00:22:44,970
make a fist spray

697
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:46,769
and with a spray bottle so your hands

698
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:48,420
all wet stick your hand in some flour or

699
00:22:46,769 --> 00:22:50,129
some powdered sugar pull your hand out

700
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:52,110
now you see where all the trichomes

701
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:53,700
would have gone open your hand now you

702
00:22:52,109 --> 00:22:55,169
see where all the trichomes did not go

703
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:56,880
spray your hand down with more water

704
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:58,679
stick that [ __ ] back in the flour or

705
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,929
the powdered sugar see how many more

706
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:04,470
trichomes you just gathered so the airy

707
00:23:00,929 --> 00:23:06,300
buds do not have more THC per se they

708
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:09,179
have more surface area so I guess if you

709
00:23:06,299 --> 00:23:12,480
lab tested a gram of those if you tested

710
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:15,480
a gram of hi-five buds against a gram of

711
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:17,579
fist punch buds I guess maybe the high 5

712
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:20,279
open-handed buds would probably contain

713
00:23:17,579 --> 00:23:23,970
more THC per gram because there is more

714
00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:25,980
surface area so that may be a thing now

715
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:27,990
we need to find out are the buds getting

716
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:30,569
fluffy and foxtail because of genetics

717
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:32,880
or because of heat and that may help us

718
00:23:30,569 --> 00:23:34,980
decide if we've got good genetics that

719
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,510
we want to use bit fox tail now you're

720
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:39,599
gonna say why would I even want it if it

721
00:23:36,509 --> 00:23:42,000
Fox tails because if it makes a lot of

722
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:44,089
big Fox tails and it produces huge

723
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,160
amounts of resin and huge amounts of THC

724
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:50,579
grow it and make concentrates out of it

725
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:54,240
the market in Colorado Springs is about

726
00:23:50,579 --> 00:23:56,879
70% concentrates 30% flower in Pueblo

727
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,170
it's about 50% in Denver I do not know

728
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,030
but I would assume it's right up there

729
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:02,130
with Colorado Springs and the 70%

730
00:24:00,029 --> 00:24:03,869
concentrate 30 percent flower range

731
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:05,670
I'm sure edibles take up some of that

732
00:24:03,869 --> 00:24:07,709
business but for what I'm watching in

733
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:09,480
the conversation that I had people sell

734
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:11,579
a lot more concentrates than they do

735
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:15,089
flowers and I see that becoming the

736
00:24:11,579 --> 00:24:16,619
trend people are people are in a hurry

737
00:24:15,089 --> 00:24:19,199
nowadays they don't have time to roll a

738
00:24:16,619 --> 00:24:21,089
joint smoked an entire joint and then

739
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,620
[ __ ] smoke another one to get as high

740
00:24:21,089 --> 00:24:25,049
as you want to be when you could grab a

741
00:24:22,619 --> 00:24:27,479
dabber heat the nail take a fat dab and

742
00:24:25,049 --> 00:24:28,799
be on your way also people are much more

743
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:31,380
health conscious they don't want to

744
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:33,299
consume as much flour and also dabbing

745
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:35,340
is just I like dabbing I don't get me

746
00:24:33,299 --> 00:24:37,230
wrong I like to smoke flowers but the

747
00:24:35,339 --> 00:24:40,069
trend is getting to where concentrates

748
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:43,380
are more popular concentrates sell more

749
00:24:40,069 --> 00:24:45,509
so if you are growing specifically to

750
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:47,850
make concentrates why wouldn't you want

751
00:24:45,509 --> 00:24:50,250
Airy buds that have more surface area to

752
00:24:47,849 --> 00:24:52,289
contain more THC

753
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:53,460
I don't see that to be a problem if

754
00:24:52,289 --> 00:24:54,779
you're just going to turn it into

755
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:56,610
concentrate so you just have to take off

756
00:24:54,779 --> 00:24:58,529
those big leaves if you've got big fan

757
00:24:56,609 --> 00:25:00,569
leaves go clip those off you can start

758
00:24:58,529 --> 00:25:01,710
taking those off a week before harvest

759
00:25:00,569 --> 00:25:02,519
just go in there and start cleaning up

760
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:03,059
the room whenever you're in there

761
00:25:02,519 --> 00:25:05,160
watering

762
00:25:03,059 --> 00:25:07,019
pick one plant just strip that [ __ ]

763
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:09,029
naked keep going every day until harvest

764
00:25:07,019 --> 00:25:10,589
however many plants you got I know you

765
00:25:09,029 --> 00:25:12,599
may have a lot of plants I know but just

766
00:25:10,589 --> 00:25:13,679
start cleaning up before harvest so you

767
00:25:12,599 --> 00:25:15,569
can just pull off all those leaves and

768
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:17,570
then a harvest time you got these area

769
00:25:15,569 --> 00:25:20,490
buds that are covered in trichomes so

770
00:25:17,569 --> 00:25:20,879
find out if it's Fox tailing and getting

771
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:22,410
Airy

772
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,750
because of environmental problems is it

773
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:26,730
too hot is it stressing out is it too

774
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:29,369
dry in there does it have a problem if

775
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:30,750
you have a problem you've got to figure

776
00:25:29,369 --> 00:25:32,789
that out maybe you've got a problem and

777
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:36,210
you're still getting mad THC if it ain't

778
00:25:32,789 --> 00:25:38,490
broke don't fix it but if it's genetics

779
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:39,930
that's making it foxtail and it's you've

780
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:42,690
got the room dialed in and it makes

781
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:44,640
foxtails and it's making a lot of THC

782
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:48,150
that may be a hash plant that is worth

783
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:50,190
keeping and I do predict that that is

784
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:51,810
the way that you're gonna see cannabis

785
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:53,130
turning for a lot of commercial grows in

786
00:25:51,809 --> 00:25:55,440
the future you're gonna see more fluffy

787
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:56,520
stuff the bag appeal right now is all

788
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,190
about like I said earlier it's about

789
00:25:56,519 --> 00:26:00,089
little acorns everyone wants rocks

790
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:02,789
acorns tight little buds that are

791
00:26:00,089 --> 00:26:05,069
covered in resin very well trimmed you

792
00:26:02,789 --> 00:26:06,720
want to see orange on there you want to

793
00:26:05,069 --> 00:26:08,099
see bright green in there you want to

794
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,480
see purple in there depending on what

795
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:11,039
you're into the purple and orange

796
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:12,509
combination looks really sharp to me I

797
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:13,859
think that really has a lot of bag of

798
00:26:12,509 --> 00:26:15,150
Peel that's usually not that we don't

799
00:26:13,859 --> 00:26:17,849
want to smoke I want the bright green

800
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:20,190
stuff most of the time I don't know but

801
00:26:17,849 --> 00:26:21,269
it's been all about the bag appeal since

802
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:22,559
you're not going for bag appeal for

803
00:26:21,269 --> 00:26:24,389
making concentrate so you can grow Airy

804
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:26,220
fluffy buds if it's based on the

805
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:28,680
genetics and not based on a problem and

806
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:30,960
if those fluffy Airy buds are producing

807
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:32,910
enough resin to make it worth your time

808
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,829
and energy so if you've got a strain

809
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:36,720
that's growing fluffy perhaps a haze or

810
00:26:34,829 --> 00:26:37,679
some sort of a tropical sativa that

811
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,839
takes a long time

812
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:41,759
and it's grown real fluffy buds when

813
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:44,069
you're finished with it make a shout of

814
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:45,839
it make BHO out of it make live resin

815
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:47,849
out of it and see what percentage of a

816
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:49,500
return you get see if it's higher than

817
00:26:47,849 --> 00:26:51,779
your standard return that you get on

818
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:53,279
your BHO or your live resin just see if

819
00:26:51,779 --> 00:26:55,410
you get more out of it and it may be

820
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:56,190
worth your time and energy just because

821
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:57,779
it's foxtail

822
00:26:56,190 --> 00:27:00,150
just because it's Airy does not

823
00:26:57,779 --> 00:27:03,029
necessarily mean that that is not able

824
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:04,060
to be high-quality concentrates and if

825
00:27:03,029 --> 00:27:05,319
you're not picky

826
00:27:04,059 --> 00:27:06,730
gonna put that butt in your grinder

827
00:27:05,319 --> 00:27:08,139
anyway and you're gonna spin that

828
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:09,490
grinder and turn it into this little

829
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:12,310
mulch eesh it you're gonna roll the

830
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:14,500
joint out of it so if it's your grow and

831
00:27:12,309 --> 00:27:17,529
it's airy and fluffy and it's got like

832
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:19,750
38 percent THC who gives a [ __ ] that it

833
00:27:17,529 --> 00:27:21,700
was fluffy right it might taste amazing

834
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:24,160
it might have all the trichomes in the

835
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:25,150
world and if it's just Airy who cares as

836
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,620
long as you're getting your weight that

837
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:27,400
you expect that you need to meet your

838
00:27:26,619 --> 00:27:28,959
needs

839
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:30,430
like if you're growing medically and you

840
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,829
smoke 2 ounces a week as long as you're

841
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:34,120
pulling 2 ounces a week maybe that's the

842
00:27:32,829 --> 00:27:35,319
product for you who cares that it's

843
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:37,149
hairy there's nothing wrong with it

844
00:27:35,319 --> 00:27:39,039
other than it doesn't have bag appeal

845
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:40,810
and it sucks the trim if you're making

846
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:42,220
concentrates it's the way to go all

847
00:27:40,809 --> 00:27:42,909
right I feel like I've rambled on enough

848
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:44,140
about that

849
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:46,930
ah thanks to my friends on Instagram

850
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:50,170
live first off for asking the question

851
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:51,700
about more THC and airy buds the answer

852
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:53,740
there is there's more surface area so

853
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:56,529
technically by weight there could be

854
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:58,509
there could be it's not always a thing

855
00:27:56,529 --> 00:28:00,069
there's not a general rule but if it's

856
00:27:58,509 --> 00:28:03,160
coated in trichomes because there's more

857
00:28:00,069 --> 00:28:05,169
surface area that is very possible also

858
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:06,580
big shout-out to all my friends who had

859

comm website I apologize for that

885
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:01,539
website it looks like total [ __ ] right

886
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:02,950
now I've been spending my energy more in

887
00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:04,240
the garden more at work more on the

888
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:06,250
podcast and actually working on the

889
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:08,049
website I am NOT the web guy I'm better

890
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:09,400
at breaking the website and improving it

891
00:29:08,049 --> 00:29:11,440
so I've got a guy that does that we

892
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:13,060
haven't spent any time together working

893
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,360
on that so I apologize the website looks

894
00:29:13,059 --> 00:29:17,279
like [ __ ] but it is alive inactive and

895
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:19,558
is where the podcast comes from that's

896
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:20,819
where the RSS feed is created our SS

897
00:29:19,558 --> 00:29:21,960
feed is then sent out to all of the

898
00:29:20,819 --> 00:29:24,779
other services where you're able to

899
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:26,340
listen for free it does cost me a little

900
00:29:24,779 --> 00:29:29,129
bit of money to keep I read genetics

901
00:29:26,339 --> 00:29:31,109
Colorado comm alive I post a lot of

902
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:32,880
content there there are two episodes

903
00:29:31,109 --> 00:29:34,439
every week one of those episodes is

904
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,720
about three hours every week and then

905
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,830
the other it varies between 30 and an

906
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,480
hour and a half just depends on who

907
00:29:37,829 --> 00:29:40,710
comes over and rambles with me but it

908
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:42,569
takes a lot of bandwidth to keep that

909
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:44,279
website alive so the people that

910
00:29:42,569 --> 00:29:46,259
