these episodes off by letting you know

29
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,060
what I'm smoking on today I'm taking

30
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,920
dabs of the chem Brule full-spectrum

31
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,899
extract from Green Dot labs

32
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,939
I love the chem Brule I think I bought

33
00:01:09,899 --> 00:01:13,649
all of the chem Brule they had in my

34
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:15,178
local dispensary I'm gonna have to find

35
00:01:13,649 --> 00:01:16,829
a new place to get that or wait for a

36
00:01:15,179 --> 00:01:18,780
fresh drop I went today and they did not

37
00:01:16,828 --> 00:01:20,699
have any more they had plenty of other

38
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:23,700
things to offer but the chem Brule has

39
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:26,609
been my favorite it tastes like lemon

40
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:28,319
peels lime peels and gasoline and then

41
00:01:26,608 --> 00:01:29,608
there's this after flavor but I can

42
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:31,469
barely figure out what it tastes like

43
00:01:29,608 --> 00:01:33,298
but I really enjoy it the high is

44
00:01:31,468 --> 00:01:36,328
perfect for what I'm looking for today

45
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:37,979
so the chem Brule full-spectrum extract

46
00:01:36,328 --> 00:01:40,708
from Green Dot labs that's what I'm

47
00:01:37,978 --> 00:01:42,899
smoking on but the best part is I'm

48
00:01:40,709 --> 00:01:44,700
smoking out of a brand new rig somebody

49
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:47,069
was sweet enough to gift me a brand new

50
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:49,289
rig it's got a sweet Rasta colored Star

51
00:01:47,069 --> 00:01:51,778
of David with a Star of David shaped

52
00:01:49,289 --> 00:01:53,609
opal on the back of that the rig of

53
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:55,108
course has red yellow and green line

54
00:01:53,608 --> 00:01:57,718
work in it because of course I love the

55
00:01:55,108 --> 00:02:00,059
red yellow and green work it is a little

56
00:01:57,718 --> 00:02:03,149
banger hanger style rig it's adorable

57
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:04,769
this was made by TW glass being shot up

58
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:06,209
to the person who gifted me this rig

59
00:02:04,769 --> 00:02:09,030
they would rather remain anonymous

60
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:12,090
I truly appreciate it this is beautiful

61
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:13,430
this is so me this is perfectly what I

62
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,769
would want for a rig

63
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:17,599
it's the right size it is Rasta colored

64
00:02:15,769 --> 00:02:19,849
and it hits like a [ __ ] truck so

65
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:22,639

to cannabis and it is a great episode so

133
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,270

134
00:04:31,009 --> 00:04:35,120

again to my friends at the growing with

138
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:41,720
fishes podcast I think I made six new

139
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:44,780
friends while being on that show

140
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:47,360
yesterday alright the next thing on my

141
00:04:44,779 --> 00:04:50,329
agenda to talk about is an apology once

142
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:53,000
again I like to think I put out a pretty

143
00:04:50,329 --> 00:04:54,560
high-quality podcast I think I put a lot

144
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,810
of work into it personally I write a lot

145
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,430
of notes I do a lot of thinking I do a

146
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:00,319
lot of preparation when the mic comes on

147
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:02,569
I try to be in a good mood I try to have

148
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:04,040
a nice flow I try to put out information

149
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:05,449
that can be absorbed by people that

150
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:07,730
learn from multiple different learning

151
00:05:05,449 --> 00:05:08,990
styles not everybody learns the same so

152
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:10,310
I try to teach you two or three

153
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:12,050
different ways that's why you hear me

154
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,670
kind of repeat myself a little bit but

155
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:15,259
I'm trying to paint the picture so that

156
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:18,170
everybody can visualize what I'm trying

157
00:05:15,259 --> 00:05:20,569
to do I try to be really thorough I feel

158
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:23,360
like the episode I wrote about building

159
00:05:20,569 --> 00:05:25,459
a water system an automated or assisted

160
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,259
watering system that was a really good

161
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:29,899
episode there were like seven pages of

162
00:05:27,259 --> 00:05:31,639
printed notes and when it came time to

163
00:05:29,899 --> 00:05:33,620
record it I thought I did a really good

164
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:36,169
job and then when it came time to edit

165
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:38,750
it my computer started eating the audio

166
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:41,390
file I think I have diagnosed the

167
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:42,800
problem I have unplugged the piece of

168
00:05:41,389 --> 00:05:44,509
equipment that I think was giving me

169
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,639
[ __ ] and I have replaced it with another

170
00:05:44,509 --> 00:05:48,709
piece of equipment and so far I'm about

171
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,599
six minutes into this recording and I

172
00:05:48,709 --> 00:05:53,689
haven't heard a glitch a pop a buzz a

173
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:56,360
hum I think I've identified the piece of

174
00:05:53,689 --> 00:05:58,699
equipment that has gone rogue on me what

175
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:01,879
I think has gone to [ __ ] is my tascam

176
00:05:58,699 --> 00:06:04,039
u.s. 1200 USB interface the part that

177
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:05,959
turns my audio signal into a digital

178
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:07,610
signal that lets me shoot it into the

179
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:10,069
computer that lets me shoot it to the

180
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:12,020
Internet I think that part has taken a

181
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:14,389
crap on me so I have unplugged that

182
00:06:12,019 --> 00:06:16,370
I've plugged in the zoom h6 and I'm

183
00:06:14,389 --> 00:06:19,009
using the h6 as the interface right now

184
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:20,750
it sounds good to my ears and the

185
00:06:19,009 --> 00:06:23,230
recording seems to be working smoothly

186
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:25,759
the software has accepted everything

187
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:27,170
honestly I didn't start seeing problems

188
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,240
in the recording last time until about

189
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:31,370
20 minutes in so I'm gonna record an

190
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:34,310
episode here with the zoom h6 this is

191
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:36,410
not going to be a grow intensive episode

192
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:38,600
I'm going to read some iTunes comments

193
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:40,729
and read a couple of emails that way if

194
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:43,159
something happens with this file I'd

195
00:06:40,728 --> 00:06:45,199
feel like a highly detailed grow lesson

196
00:06:43,158 --> 00:06:47,569
got ruined and wasted and I don't have

197
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:49,370
to redo that for you so this all started

198
00:06:47,569 --> 00:06:51,050
off with me saying I'm sorry I'm sorry

199
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:53,240
for that piece of [ __ ] episode that I

200
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:56,270
put out last time I worked really hard

201
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:58,519
on it I promise I think you can tell by

202
00:06:56,269 --> 00:07:00,528
what was presented but the audio file

203
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:02,299
disappeared and the more I tried to

204
00:07:00,528 --> 00:07:04,308
search and figure out what was going on

205
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:06,528
the more stuff just kept disappearing

206
00:07:04,309 --> 00:07:08,240
from ITAR from GarageBand and I didn't

207
00:07:06,528 --> 00:07:10,399
want to lose more so I put out what I

208
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,259
had I apologize for the incomplete

209
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:14,658
assignment I know you guys expect more

210
00:07:12,259 --> 00:07:16,639
than that from me and I know that I'm

211
00:07:14,658 --> 00:07:18,288
better than that I just want to say I

212
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,569
was embarrassed to put that out but I

213
00:07:18,288 --> 00:07:23,058
was also frustrated it was 1:30 in the

214
00:07:20,569 --> 00:07:25,009
morning I was exhausted I was frustrated

215
00:07:23,059 --> 00:07:26,930
I just wanted to put something out and

216
00:07:25,009 --> 00:07:28,879
give up and move forward so that's what

217
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:31,158
I did here we are with the next episode

218
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:33,080
it sounds good so far I've given you a

219
00:07:31,158 --> 00:07:35,658
solid apology I hope it doesn't happen

220
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:38,300
again I can't promise because I am NOT a

221
00:07:35,658 --> 00:07:40,399
USB device I can't promise you that I

222
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:42,889
may not just go rogue at some point and

223
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:44,538
start recording in a different bit rate

224
00:07:42,889 --> 00:07:47,149
or just start deleting chunks of the

225
00:07:44,538 --> 00:07:49,370
file I can't promise you but I can

226
00:07:47,149 --> 00:07:51,228
promise you that I will do my best to

227
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:54,408
keep bringing you the best quality

228
00:07:51,228 --> 00:07:56,060
podcast I can present you guys thanks

229
00:07:54,408 --> 00:07:58,310
for bearing with me for a crappy podcast

230
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:59,300
it kind of kind of made me feel bad to

231
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:01,579
tell you the honest truth it made me

232
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:03,709
feel guilty I you guys count on me for

233
00:08:01,579 --> 00:08:06,288
some [ __ ] and I delivered crap so I feel

234
00:08:03,709 --> 00:08:07,788
like a bad waiter I feel like a bad host

235
00:08:06,288 --> 00:08:09,438
but I'm recovering let's move forward

236
00:08:07,788 --> 00:08:10,728
from that crap I apologized

237
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:12,439
you guys are all giving me hugs and

238
00:08:10,728 --> 00:08:15,050
forgiving me I appreciate it thanks for

239
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:17,028
supporting me like I said I don't want

240
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:19,098
to put out a crazy grow episode in case

241
00:08:17,028 --> 00:08:20,689
this recording goes wrong I think that

242
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:22,819
my tascam device was the problem

243
00:08:20,689 --> 00:08:25,249
everything feels really smooth right now

244
00:08:22,819 --> 00:08:26,990
the zoom h6 is working I just want to

245
00:08:25,249 --> 00:08:29,120
record a couple of episodes before I go

246
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:30,680
super intense on gross stuff make sure

247
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,500
nothing's gonna screw up on me again

248
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:35,089
in fact I noticed my problem started

249
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:37,278
happening during playback so what I'm

250
00:08:35,089 --> 00:08:39,919
gonna do before I read some iTunes

251
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:41,328
comments I'm gonna press pause I'm gonna

252
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:43,458
play back this part of the show that

253
00:08:41,328 --> 00:08:45,078
I've already recorded I'm gonna see how

254
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:47,299
it sounds make sure everything looks

255
00:08:45,078 --> 00:08:49,969
good sounds good and feels good then if

256
00:08:47,299 --> 00:08:51,379
it works well I'll keep recording while

257
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:54,440
I'm listening back I'm gonna take a

258
00:08:51,379 --> 00:08:55,820
bunch of dabs I'm gonna get lit as [ __ ]

259
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,260
this episode I usually don't do that I

260
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:59,690
usually don't take a lot of dads during

261
00:08:57,259 --> 00:09:01,159
the show we're gonna see how this goes

262
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:02,450
we're gonna make sure the equipment

263
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:03,769
works we're gonna make sure the new rig

264
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:05,990
works we're gonna make sure the new hash

265
00:09:03,769 --> 00:09:07,669
works we're gonna make sure we're just

266
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:09,350
gonna have fun we're not gonna go all

267
00:09:07,669 --> 00:09:10,819
crazy on this episode you guys but

268
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:12,409
please hang out we'll listen to some

269
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:13,970
itunes comments we may read a couple of

270
00:09:12,409 --> 00:09:15,589
emails hang out with me

271
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:17,300
I'm gonna take some dabs I'm gonna

272
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:19,100
listen back a little bit I might drop a

273
00:09:17,299 --> 00:09:21,709
song in right here you never know what

274
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:23,600
could happen I do promise that if you

275
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:25,430
bear with me through a couple of funky

276
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,379
episodes then we're gonna get real crazy

277
00:09:25,429 --> 00:09:29,329
on Gro lessons I've got so much growths

278
00:09:27,379 --> 00:09:31,580
gross stuff written down that I can't

279
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:32,990
wait to get to it but I really want to

280
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:34,850
make sure my equipment works before I

281
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:36,950
start doing that so maybe one or two

282
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:38,360
episodes just some random stuff and then

283
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:40,129
we're gonna go hard on Gro lessons I

284
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:41,629
know you guys love the lessons a lot of

285
00:09:40,129 --> 00:09:43,279
you guys love hanging out please bear

286
00:09:41,629 --> 00:09:45,379
with me and also while I'm thinking

287
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:47,659
about it big shout out to everybody who

288
00:09:45,379 --> 00:09:49,909
supports me on patreon because of the

289
00:09:47,659 --> 00:09:52,129
patreon support having a broken piece of

290
00:09:49,909 --> 00:09:54,469
equipment is not a financial struggle I

291
00:09:52,129 --> 00:09:56,450
can replace this I need to decide which

292
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:58,820
one I want and then I can order it do I

293
00:09:56,450 --> 00:10:00,050
want the tascam to in two out or do I

294
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:01,610
want to get the one that fits in the

295
00:10:00,049 --> 00:10:03,229
rack I'd like another rack-mounted

296
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:05,930
device kind of debating if that's

297
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:08,149
necessary I honestly just use two

298
00:10:05,929 --> 00:10:10,039
channels for the USB I run a Mac II

299
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:12,769
mixer into a compressor the compressor

300
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:14,599
has a left and right out and I run that

301
00:10:12,769 --> 00:10:17,870
left and right out into channels one and

302
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:20,060
two on my tascam USB device so I

303
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:21,769
probably just need the - but it's not

304
00:10:20,059 --> 00:10:23,269
rack mounted and that's frustrating to

305
00:10:21,769 --> 00:10:25,250
me I like that it all fits in this nice

306
00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:25,789
rack I've got here yes I did say nice

307
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:28,580
rack

308
00:10:25,789 --> 00:10:30,169
you guys I'm [ __ ] rambly I am going to

309
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:31,850
press pause I'm gonna take a bunch of

310
00:10:30,169 --> 00:10:33,469
dads I hope you take some dads with me

311
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:34,970
I'm gonna listen back to everything I've

312
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:36,560
recorded make sure it sounds good and

313
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:38,950
then I'll be right back to keep going

314
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:38,949
with the show

315
00:10:39,029 --> 00:11:00,079
[Music]

316
00:10:57,129 --> 00:11:02,960
all right podcast world I am back I hope

317
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:04,490
you loved that funky cowbell groove you

318
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:06,590
guys I took a bunch of great dabs I dab

319
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:08,450
some of this Ken Brule I also dab some

320
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:11,690
of the soul cleanser the soul cleanser

321
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:14,240
tastes like gatorade powder and Windex

322
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:16,220
kind of it's delicious and weird all at

323
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,080
the same time I really enjoy that took a

324
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:20,180
bunch of dabs made sure this new rig

325
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:22,580
works it seems to be passing quality

326
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:24,409
control standards so far the part I've

327
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:26,450
recorded sounds pretty good other than

328
00:11:24,409 --> 00:11:27,579
my voice being in there the recording

329
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:29,540
works pretty well

330
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:31,160
thanks for hanging out with me you guys

331
00:11:29,539 --> 00:11:32,899
I'm having fun today I've had a great

332
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:35,509
day I'm having fun recording with you

333
00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:36,620
guys I hope you were enjoying this weird

334
00:11:35,509 --> 00:11:38,029
episode it's not gonna be a normal

335
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:39,049
episode it feels different to me because

336
00:11:38,029 --> 00:11:40,699
I'm recording with different equipment

337
00:11:39,049 --> 00:11:44,000
I'm waiting for something to go wrong

338
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:45,620
hopefully nothing does go wrong to me it

339
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,360
kind of feels like school on a rainy day

340
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:49,460
or like I've got a substitute teacher

341
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,169
I'm just my eyes are bouncing back and

342
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:53,480
forth from the computer screen to the

343
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:54,799
zoom h6 to the mixer to the compressor

344
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,420
I'm just making sure all the correct

345
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:58,250
lights are flashing at the right time

346
00:11:56,419 --> 00:12:00,259
just kind of making sure the gear works

347
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:02,330
I will get this dialed in we're only

348
00:12:00,259 --> 00:12:04,279
gonna have to do this one more time when

349
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:05,930
the new replacement piece comes in I'll

350
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:07,819
have to dial that in and then we'll have

351
00:12:05,929 --> 00:12:09,349
the podcast right back up to speed we'll

352
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:10,910
get into those killer Gro episodes like

353
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:12,200
I've been talking about because I'm not

354
00:12:10,909 --> 00:12:15,139
bullshitting you I've got an episode

355
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:17,990
about germinating seeds I've got an

356
00:12:15,139 --> 00:12:19,610
episode about cutting clones I've got an

357
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:22,039
episode about putting those seeds or

358
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:23,810
clones into soil I've got an episode

359
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:25,579
about transplanting those once they get

360
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:28,519
larger I've got an episode about

361
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:30,139
vegetative phase I'm sure that's enough

362
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:32,120
to let you know I've got a whole bunch

363
00:12:30,139 --> 00:12:34,490
of great [ __ ] lined up for you also I

364
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:37,159
have an episode planned to talk about

365
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:38,629
seed vs. clone if you're not sure if you

366
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:40,399
want to grow from seeds or clone when

367
00:12:38,629 --> 00:12:41,960
you start your fresh garden I've got an

368
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,029
episode all about that we'll talk about

369
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:45,800
the pros and cons of each so that's

370
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:47,659
coming up in the future but let's get

371
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:50,209
the equipment dialed in before we start

372
00:12:47,659 --> 00:12:52,039
putting out super intensive grow lessons

373
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:54,000
and then the computer fails and it makes

374
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:55,409
me want to just go crazy so

375
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,590
let's get that dialed in and we'll work

376
00:12:55,409 --> 00:13:02,209
on that in the meantime let's get to

377
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:04,350
some iTunes customer ratings and reviews

378
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:06,420
if you'd like to leave a rating and

379
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:08,100
review on iTunes I would appreciate it

381
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:12,360
through iTunes on your computer or if

382
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:14,910

00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:28,259
show you the ratings and reviews that

390
00:13:26,429 --> 00:13:29,639

channel so if you want to go listen to

488
00:17:02,009 --> 00:17:05,730
everything it's there it may seem weird

489
00:17:04,259 --> 00:17:08,099
because back in the day the show was

490
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:09,779
called the iGrow culture podcast I came

491
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:12,889
to find out that I grow culture is

492
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:15,949
already taken that is the name of a an

493
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:19,380
educational institution they teach about

494
00:17:15,949 --> 00:17:21,120
Agriculture on the college level over

495
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,720
the internet go figure right I thought

496
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:23,099
it was original

497
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,328
I wasn't trying to steal a name but as

498
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:25,588
soon as they told me that name was taken

499
00:17:24,328 --> 00:17:27,418
I changed my name to the girl from your

500
00:17:25,588 --> 00:17:29,730
heart podcast much more appropriate

501
00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:32,429

502
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:34,230

Nana boy I can't see the headline

523
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:14,130
because the review is short there's no

524
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:15,990
button to press more but I can see that

525
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:18,330
there is a headline and I think it says

526
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:19,980
thank you I can see fan I'm gonna hope

527

00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:23,970

love it when you step in and shine some

554
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:20,519
light on subjects that the boys are just

555
00:19:18,509 --> 00:19:22,470
way in the dark in that's my favorite so

556
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:24,750
chefs are those guys I should keep going

557
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:28,230

558
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:29,669
high and rambley so have fun with me so

559
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:30,960
far nothing has gone wrong with the

560
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:32,880
recording equipment I keep looking at

561
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,590
everything and I'm happy we're almost 20

562
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,340
minutes in and nothing is caught on fire

563
00:19:34,589 --> 00:19:36,389
no spring

564
00:19:35,339 --> 00:19:37,769
have flown out like it does on the

565
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:39,720
cartoons how come when something breaks

566
00:19:37,769 --> 00:19:41,759
on the cartoons Springs fly out Boing

567
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,350
and Springs and sprockets fly out it

568
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:45,210
could be a computer it could be anything

569
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:46,859
it could be somebody's heart and springs

570
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:48,269
fly out I think it's so [ __ ] funny

571
00:19:46,859 --> 00:19:50,789
right let's keep going

572
00:19:48,269 --> 00:19:52,500
this one was left on June 17th from

573
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:54,269
somebody who calls themselves Mateo

574
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,710

575
00:19:54,269 --> 00:19:57,809

00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:12,059
shares every week and goes into detail

583
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:14,730

you're not required to pay for this

600
00:20:44,339 --> 00:20:48,179
podcast it's free I want to put this out

601
00:20:46,109 --> 00:20:50,009
because I love recording I love cannabis

602
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:52,470
I love you guys and I think it's kind of

603
00:20:50,009 --> 00:20:54,480
my duty I know it sounds weird but we're

604
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:56,519
all put here for something and I've got

605
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,799
a few solid purposes that I know I'm

606
00:20:56,519 --> 00:21:01,619
meant to be doing and this is something

607
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:03,720
that I know like if if they came to

608
00:21:01,619 --> 00:21:05,039
something if whoever you believe in you

609
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:07,410
know you guys know what I believe in my

610
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:09,019
name is Rasta Jeff if Jah came to me and

611
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:11,040
said you can only pick five things

612
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:12,720
recording would be recording this

613
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:14,700
podcast would be one of the five things

614
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,620
I know I'm supposed to be doing you know

615
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:18,539
I wouldn't cut this out cuz I know it's

616
00:21:16,619 --> 00:21:20,849
right anyway I'm [ __ ] rambling you

617
00:21:18,539 --> 00:21:23,129
guys sharing the knowledge freely that's

618
00:21:20,849 --> 00:21:25,019
because I feel like it's my gift that I

619
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:26,580
need to give back to you guys to the

620
00:21:25,019 --> 00:21:28,079
cannabis community the cannabis plant

621
00:21:26,579 --> 00:21:30,539
and the cannabis community has been

622
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:33,149
super kind to me and super generous to

623
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:34,680
me so I just turned that back around and

624
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:38,640
just put that right back out as what I

625
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:40,380
feel like I'm doing also uh he says I go

626
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:43,440
into detail instead of skimming over

627
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:45,120
subjects I do kind of pick one subject

628
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,929
to beat the [ __ ] out of it for an entire

629
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:50,538
episode but like I said earlier pee

630
00:21:47,929 --> 00:21:52,129
don't all learn from the same thing the

631
00:21:50,538 --> 00:21:53,388
same type of teaching that's why in

632
00:21:52,128 --> 00:21:54,888
school the teacher used to bore the [ __ ]

633
00:21:53,388 --> 00:21:56,778
out of me because she would teach 5

634
00:21:54,888 --> 00:21:59,449
different ways and I caught on the first

635
00:21:56,778 --> 00:22:01,220
way I'm sure there were kids at that

636
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:02,749
first the way she taught that didn't

637
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:04,190
click she had to teach at the second way

638
00:22:02,749 --> 00:22:05,720
there were probably some kids weren't

639
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:07,788
velcro shoes that needed the third

640
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:10,129
teaching I just want to make sure that

641
00:22:07,788 --> 00:22:12,259
everybody can figure it out we all don't

642
00:22:10,128 --> 00:22:13,878
have some of us think in cartoon some of

643
00:22:12,259 --> 00:22:16,128
us think with [ __ ] graph paper in our

644
00:22:13,878 --> 00:22:17,449
brain some of us can think an autocad I

645
00:22:16,128 --> 00:22:19,579
just want to make sure that the people

646
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:21,619
thinking in crayons the people thinking

647
00:22:19,579 --> 00:22:22,939
in autocad the people that have done

648
00:22:21,618 --> 00:22:24,829
this a thousand times I wanna make sure

649
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:25,999
everybody feels included in the show I

650
00:22:24,829 --> 00:22:28,038
don't want to lose anybody

651
00:22:25,999 --> 00:22:29,990
I want the if the missions are first

652
00:22:28,038 --> 00:22:31,908
grow I want this to make sense to you if

653
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:34,609
you've been growing commercially for a

654
00:22:31,909 --> 00:22:36,019
hundred years and you've done it all I

655
00:22:34,609 --> 00:22:37,459
still want this show to be entertaining

656
00:22:36,019 --> 00:22:39,259
to you so that's why I hid things at

657
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:41,329
different angles and a lot of the other

658
00:22:39,259 --> 00:22:43,128
shows just skim right over stuff they'll

659
00:22:41,329 --> 00:22:45,199
be like what's the best kind of light I

660

like HBS's okay let's move forward and

661

[ __ ] skipped right over and I'm good

663
00:22:49,878 --> 00:22:53,538

664
00:22:52,099 --> 00:22:55,759
them and making sure you guys don't miss

665
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:57,019
detail so thanks for noticing that then

687
00:23:40,638 --> 00:23:44,689
into growing listen to Jeff explain

688
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:46,720
everything ranging from light cycles to

689
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:49,909
fee nose and everything else in between

690
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:52,639
Mike who is a regular guest is always a

691
00:23:49,909 --> 00:23:54,740
great addition to any episode hey that's

692
00:23:52,638 --> 00:23:55,699
a really cool review of my show I

693
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:57,259
appreciate that

694
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:58,609
aw that that's inviting that makes

695
00:23:57,259 --> 00:24:00,919
people want to listen to the show if

696
00:23:58,608 --> 00:24:02,139
you're even curious about the work that

697
00:24:00,919 --> 00:24:04,450
goes into growing list

698
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:05,980
to Jeff but that means that you trust me

699
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:07,509
that I could tell you what's going on

700
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:09,039
that you know I've done it enough and I

701
00:24:07,509 --> 00:24:10,599
figured out how to word it properly that

702
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:12,990
you trust me to explain it to the new

fee nose to everything else in between

706
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:19,960
that is pretty cool because light cycles

707
00:24:18,819 --> 00:24:21,700
is like the first [ __ ] you need to

708
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:23,920
figure out and then fee nose is like

709
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:25,450
some advanced stuff so you've you've

710
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,800

711
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:28,750
thank you and then everything in between

712
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:30,789

717
00:24:36,339 --> 00:24:40,000
likes to get us rambling and talkative

718
00:24:38,019 --> 00:24:41,980
and he opens up a whole new point of

719
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,900
view and a whole new perspective on the

720
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:45,130
way that things are done so I appreciate

721

763
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:05,590

764
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:06,910
over to iTunes type in a little review

765
00:26:05,589 --> 00:26:09,959
let me know what you think about the

766
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:11,340
show I would love to hear from you

767
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,960
all right you guys the show is creeping

768
00:26:11,339 --> 00:26:14,428
up on 30 minutes we're at 26 minutes

769
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,259
here we have not had any technical

770
00:26:14,429 --> 00:26:18,179
difficulties I've noticed that the

771
00:26:16,259 --> 00:26:20,069
previous issues would happen when I

772
00:26:18,179 --> 00:26:22,169
would stop the recording and go back and

773
00:26:20,069 --> 00:26:23,639
record over a messed up track I've done

774
00:26:22,169 --> 00:26:25,409
that a couple of times on purpose now

775
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,640
just to kind of mess with the recording

776
00:26:25,409 --> 00:26:28,919
software and see if that was where the

777
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:31,350
issue lies the issue does not seem to be

778
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:33,960
within the computer the issue I'm 90%

779
00:26:31,349 --> 00:26:36,058
certain was with this Tascam device so

780
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:38,399
I'm going to replace that I think

781
00:26:36,058 --> 00:26:40,259
everything should be just fine

782
00:26:38,398 --> 00:26:42,599
I'm not sure why I feel like I have to

783
00:26:40,259 --> 00:26:44,849
tell you about all of my tech issues but

784
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:46,859
now we're on the same page together and

785
00:26:44,849 --> 00:26:48,449
we're all friends all right you guys

786
00:26:46,859 --> 00:26:50,579
before I start wrapping up this podcast

787
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:52,798
let's talk a little bit about my most

788
00:26:50,579 --> 00:26:54,329
recent breeding project a lot of times I

789
00:26:52,798 --> 00:26:56,700
come on here and I share what I'm

790
00:26:54,329 --> 00:26:58,859
working on in my garden recently I

791
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:01,080
decided to make more lemon Jeffrey

792
00:26:58,859 --> 00:27:03,750
feminized seeds and more golden goat

793
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:06,240
feminized seeds golden goat is just a

794
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:08,339
golden goat female reversed I turn it

795
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,919
into a boy I used that pollen on another

796
00:27:08,339 --> 00:27:13,259
golden goat clone and that makes golden

797
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:15,990
goat s1 self seeds that will make

798
00:27:13,259 --> 00:27:17,879
progeny that'll make offspring they look

799
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:20,308
just like gold and go for the most part

800
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:22,740
you will have golden goat s1 feminized

801
00:27:20,308 --> 00:27:26,069
seeds that are reliable golden goat

802
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:28,079
looking seeds then I took that golden

803
00:27:26,069 --> 00:27:30,898
goat feminized pollen and I threw some

804
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:31,949
of that on my favorite lemon skunk plant

805
00:27:30,898 --> 00:27:35,339
that makes

806
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:39,240
lemon Jeffrey feminized r1 seeds those

807
00:27:35,339 --> 00:27:41,490
will be giant colas it smell like lemon

808
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:43,798
candy that are just coated in trichomes

809
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:45,870
the buds are usually bright green and

810
00:27:43,798 --> 00:27:48,960
super sticky and it makes amazing

811
00:27:45,869 --> 00:27:51,089
concentrates but the lemon Jeffery and

812
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:53,278
the golden goat feminized seeds are

813
00:27:51,089 --> 00:27:54,869
almost done I know I kind of quit

814
00:27:53,278 --> 00:27:56,490
talking about it for a minute it seemed

815
00:27:54,869 --> 00:27:57,989
like I was just hyping up a product that

816
00:27:56,490 --> 00:28:00,089
wasn't going to be available and a lot

817
00:27:57,990 --> 00:28:02,519
of people were asking you guys they

818
00:28:00,089 --> 00:28:03,898
should be harvested very soon the seeds

819
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:05,548
are hard I pulled a couple seeds out

820
00:28:03,898 --> 00:28:07,528
gave them a squeeze most of them are

821
00:28:05,548 --> 00:28:09,750
hard enough to my satisfaction I will

822
00:28:07,528 --> 00:28:12,690
cut them down very soon and we will have

823
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:15,589
lemon Jeffrey and golden goat feminized

824
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:17,399
