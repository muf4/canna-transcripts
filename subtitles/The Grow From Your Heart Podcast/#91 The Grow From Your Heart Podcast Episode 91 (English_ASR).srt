started I want to let you know that this

24
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,260
is a part two episode a few days ago

25
00:00:57,579 --> 00:01:01,118
Jesse was here and we recorded for quite

26
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:03,939
a while I put up the first half of the

27
00:01:01,118 --> 00:01:06,939
conversation on Monday this is part two

28
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:08,950
it starts off with me I asked Jesse if

29
00:01:06,939 --> 00:01:11,109
he had any guidance or advice to give

30
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:13,030
growers and then we'll just jump into

31
00:01:11,109 --> 00:01:14,739
right where he started before we get

32
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:18,099
there I do want to make an apology I

33
00:01:14,739 --> 00:01:19,719
posted episode 92 iTunes and my website

34
00:01:18,099 --> 00:01:23,229
and stitcher and for some reason episode

35
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:24,640
90 did not make it to stitcher I like it

36
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:26,650
normally would have that was not my

37
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,870
issue it was stitchers issue they have

38
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:31,180
since been emailed as soon as stitcher

39
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:33,640
gets episode 90 up I will post episode

40
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:35,500
91 I don't want to cause any confusion

41
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:37,329
with stitcher I've emailed them and let

42
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,950
them know that my latest episode did not

43
00:01:37,329 --> 00:01:40,870
post so I don't want to have another

44
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:42,549
episode on to that and confuse them as

45
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:44,950
soon as stitcher gets episode 90 out

46
00:01:42,549 --> 00:01:46,390
episode 91 will be posted right after

47
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:47,710
that I appreciate you guys for being

48
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:49,320
patient I do apologize for any

49
00:01:47,709 --> 00:01:51,250
inconvenience that may have caused I

50
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:52,509
feel like I've been rambling enough it's

51
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:54,219
almost a two-minute intro let's get

52
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:56,440
right down to the part where Jesse and I

53
00:01:54,219 --> 00:01:57,879
are talking so here we go I asked Jesse

54
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:59,349
I basically said do you have any

55
00:01:57,879 --> 00:02:02,408
guidance that you would like to share

56
00:01:59,349 --> 00:02:05,439
with our listeners and then here is what

57
00:02:02,409 --> 00:02:07,659
Jesse had to say don't sell junk clones

58
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:11,620
don't sell junk clones don't sell

59
00:02:07,659 --> 00:02:14,829
untested seeds oh my god I don't sell

60
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:15,150
clones of plants from seed that you have

61
00:02:14,829 --> 00:02:17,610
any

62
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:19,408
floured yet yeah definitely I've heard

63
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:21,810
so many horror stories at the gross

64
00:02:19,408 --> 00:02:25,109
store like I feel so bad for people like

65
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:27,239
I can't help them but it just it really

66
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:30,750
sucks if you do that stuff do it right

67
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:32,310
if you get a bag seed out of what's this

68
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:34,789
hash this is Startalk I'm taking a dab a

69
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:38,759
star dog from there just give it to max

70
00:02:34,789 --> 00:02:40,828
if if you I wasn't even gonna say now if

71
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:43,828
you get a bag seed of it okay you grow

72
00:02:40,829 --> 00:02:45,329
it out and then oh oh if you get if you

73
00:02:43,829 --> 00:02:48,120
grow some weed and it's got a bunch of

74
00:02:45,329 --> 00:02:50,189
seeds in it that star dog plant just cuz

75
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,259
it's wholly seeded to [ __ ] doesn't mean

76
00:02:50,189 --> 00:02:55,259
you can call those seed star dog those

77
00:02:52,259 --> 00:02:57,719
are not star dog seeds no no those are

78
00:02:55,259 --> 00:03:01,699
unknown seeds unless you hit that star

79
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:03,840
dog girl with male star dog pollen or

80
00:03:01,699 --> 00:03:07,979
manipulated the plant in some other

81
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:10,829
fashion to create s1 seeds it does

82
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:13,348
happen you know if you don't it's still

83
00:03:10,829 --> 00:03:15,269
not exactly it right but if you I thing

84
00:03:13,348 --> 00:03:17,608
is if you don't know what did it yeah

85
00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:19,019
don't call it start yeah yeah because it

86
00:03:17,609 --> 00:03:19,980
could be there could have been some

87
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:21,599
pollen in there it could have been

88
00:03:19,979 --> 00:03:23,848
another one of the plants that firmed on

89
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:26,159
it it could have been a male in there if

90
00:03:23,848 --> 00:03:27,750
if all you had was seven star dog plants

91
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,430
in there I guess you do have star dog

92
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,989
seeds if you light stressed it and it

93
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:32,849
produced a bunch of seeds you do now

94
00:03:30,989 --> 00:03:38,120
have star dog seat that could have been

95
00:03:32,848 --> 00:03:41,459
a a really special recessive clone

96
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:44,639
phenotype and and what comes out is the

97
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:48,299
dominant piece of junk you know Riya yes

98
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:49,709
you're gonna see grandpa when you see

99
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:51,840
what the grandpa was you're gonna see

100
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:53,848
what grandma was and sometimes those

101
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,639
plants were shitty or something you just

102
00:03:53,848 --> 00:03:59,369
never know a lot of what we have now the

103
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:01,349
plants that we're growing now are like

104
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:05,729
your dad's fault you know what I mean so

105
00:04:01,348 --> 00:04:08,459
Jessie's dad they're the ones who chose

106
00:04:05,729 --> 00:04:11,220
these actually did some breeding back

107
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:15,569
then so they had to use to steal

108
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:17,189
streetlights they couldn't run too much

109
00:04:15,568 --> 00:04:18,750
electricity they didn't know what the

110
00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:20,668
hell they were looking for they had the

111
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:23,418
shittiest books everything in the books

112
00:04:20,668 --> 00:04:26,158
back then was hand-drawn uh people were

113
00:04:23,418 --> 00:04:27,029
still they were still in electricity

114
00:04:26,158 --> 00:04:29,819
back

115
00:04:27,029 --> 00:04:32,309
yeah and hand-drawn books that you had

116
00:04:29,819 --> 00:04:35,550
to go to shady ass head shops to buy not

117
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:36,750
to Mel Frank I'm gonna take this dad

118
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:38,430
here then we'll start doing this but

119
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:40,139
yeah those that generation is

120
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:42,360
responsible for the plants that we have

121
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:43,949
now those guys some of the guys that

122
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,810
went to war in other countries brought

123
00:04:43,949 --> 00:04:47,219
back seeds from those regions they grew

124
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:48,959
those seeds they found that somewhere

125
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:51,180
too damn tall they found that some took

126
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:53,699
way too long and they got rid of them

127
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:55,860
and I bet you bro I bet they're now that

128
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:58,139
we've got room and space and lights and

129
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:01,290
Technology I bet some of the gold was

130
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:03,300
thrown the [ __ ] alone oh I guarantee if

131

00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:26,788
this business is mined air the building

165
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,529
in which they were located was sold and

166
00:06:26,788 --> 00:06:30,538
the new owner did not want a dispensary

167
00:06:28,529 --> 00:06:32,309
there it's basically the story so they

168
00:06:30,538 --> 00:06:34,740
were forced to move they do have a new

169
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:36,329
location by the time you hear this it is

170
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:38,579
likely that they are open to back for

171
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:40,528
business and if they are not trust me

172
00:06:38,579 --> 00:06:42,868
you guys green and healthy woman is fast

173
00:06:40,528 --> 00:06:44,728
like dude I saw them working to tear

174
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:46,499
down the building and it was like army

175
00:06:44,728 --> 00:06:47,068
ants and they're just going buck wild it

176
00:06:46,499 --> 00:06:48,838
was crazy

177
00:06:47,069 --> 00:06:50,429
everybody was sweaty and had this

178
00:06:48,838 --> 00:06:54,059
stressful look so they're getting melty

179
00:06:50,428 --> 00:06:55,138
crow to everything yeah so that's always

180

fun yeah

181
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:58,499

00:07:06,418 --> 00:07:10,348
building they got a better location is

188
00:07:08,608 --> 00:07:11,818
bigger that building was a little tight

189
00:07:10,348 --> 00:07:14,848
the parking would get a little cramped

190
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:17,218

wellness will be carrying the flowers

231
00:08:42,328 --> 00:08:46,438
for sure in the near future the spot

232
00:08:44,669 --> 00:08:47,938
will have the flowers but you guys this

233
00:08:46,438 --> 00:08:49,169
is a year-long project don't think this

234
00:08:47,938 --> 00:08:51,928
something this is something that's going

235
00:08:49,169 --> 00:08:53,449
to go in a few weeks we bred a strain we

236
00:08:51,928 --> 00:08:56,120
bred a seed line

237
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:58,490
red 3c lines we took those seedlings

238
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:01,009
they germinated they are now in veg they

239
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:02,269
just got put into three gallon pots I've

240
00:09:01,009 --> 00:09:05,299
got to run

241
00:09:02,269 --> 00:09:07,579
I think 22 of them out of the original I

242
00:09:05,299 --> 00:09:08,990
think 30 started 22 of them have made it

243
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,720
to where I think they'll make it to the

244
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:14,120
flour room I may take one or two out

245
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:16,100
ones too tall and lanky it's a boy I can

246
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:18,049
tell just by looking so I kind of want

247
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:19,909
to just pull that one but then they'll

248
00:09:18,049 --> 00:09:22,399
flower once they're flowered there's a

249
00:09:19,909 --> 00:09:24,019
private party set up the dates already

250
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,909
been chosen as a location being put

251
00:09:24,019 --> 00:09:27,939
together and the Graeme Gatsby is gonna

252
00:09:25,909 --> 00:09:30,649
throw a tasting party and there will be

253
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:32,660
scorecards and video done and full-on

254
00:09:30,649 --> 00:09:34,789
reviews so yeah we're taking this one

255
00:09:32,659 --> 00:09:36,439
quite seriously and this just a Fino

256
00:09:34,789 --> 00:09:39,589
hunt imagine if he was actually taking

257
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:41,600
the seeds to market right so two year

258
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:43,310
project yeah exactly because I would run

259
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,860
a run at least a hundred of those seeds

260
00:09:43,309 --> 00:09:47,509
myself after I ran 20 or 50 of them

261
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:49,009
myself I would start sending 10 packs

262
00:09:47,509 --> 00:09:53,720
out to friends I'd give you ten of them

263
00:09:49,009 --> 00:09:55,189
no sin amounts of friends that are eager

264
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,899
to grow they would grow them right away

265
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:58,820
they would send me pictures they would

266
00:09:56,899 --> 00:10:00,559
send me feedback if they're local I get

267
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:02,150
to go I get to go to Rasta Ralph's

268
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:04,069
garden and look at my blue heeler growin

269
00:10:02,149 --> 00:10:05,689
I get to go to people's places and see

270
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:08,750
my plants growing in their garden to get

271
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:09,980
feedback which improves my breeding

272
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:11,240
because then I could say oh god I never

273
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:14,269
want to breed with that [ __ ] plant

274
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:17,019
ever again what is the blue heeler blue

275
00:10:14,269 --> 00:10:19,279
heeler is the blue band The Grateful dog

276
00:10:17,019 --> 00:10:20,629
okay shout out to Spencer for the name I

277
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:22,220
was like I'm gonna cross through the

278
00:10:20,629 --> 00:10:27,470
Blue Dream and The Grateful dog because

279
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:30,680
that's blue heeler packs of seeds for

280
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:33,050
that I I don't think I've ever grown a

281
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:34,789
blue dream cross it's not my favorite

282
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:38,240
strain in the world to be honest that

283
00:10:34,789 --> 00:10:40,669
was Colorado was in love with Blue Dream

284
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,740
and the girls in California are in love

285
00:10:40,669 --> 00:10:44,959
with blue dream it's a cash crop plant

286
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:47,720
it does have some medicinal value but

287
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:52,430
it's used too much here as a cash crop

288
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:54,710
plant for what it is it's uh I forgot

289
00:10:52,429 --> 00:10:57,259
the cross of it suddenly that blueberry

290
00:10:54,710 --> 00:11:00,139
and Silver Haze yeah yeah I guess it's

291
00:10:57,259 --> 00:11:03,889
by DJ shorts son or something like that

292
00:11:00,139 --> 00:11:05,720
isn't it yeah or son-in-law I'm not sure

293
00:11:03,889 --> 00:11:07,309
if that's actually true because I

294
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,689
yeah that's up for debate guys if you

295
00:11:07,309 --> 00:11:12,198
know the truth of where the Blue Dream

296
00:11:08,688 --> 00:11:13,909
came from but it's a haze and it's a

297
00:11:12,198 --> 00:11:15,469
blue dream and it's got some og I think

298
00:11:13,909 --> 00:11:16,759
in there but you would think from what

299
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:18,709
I've read I remember thinking that would

300
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:19,818
be the ideal strain but then I remember

301
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:21,409
getting my hands on a couple of

302
00:11:19,818 --> 00:11:23,289
different grows of it and smoking it I

303
00:11:21,409 --> 00:11:26,000
mean like this is medium there's a

304
00:11:23,289 --> 00:11:27,649
amazing [ __ ] phenotype of it and

305
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,708
these blue dream phenotype is the most

306
00:11:27,649 --> 00:11:32,629
impressive I've seen yeah there's just a

307
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:34,429
phenotype you guys it's labeled abd it's

308
00:11:32,629 --> 00:11:36,560
an easy thing that's just the blue dream

309
00:11:34,429 --> 00:11:40,429
that's everywhere yeah it's all over

310
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:43,219
Colorado oh I'm pretty sure it's the one

311
00:11:40,429 --> 00:11:45,078
i bred - yeah but the blue dream kicks

312
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:46,519
out you can pull two pounds under a

313
00:11:45,078 --> 00:11:48,559
thousand watt light and soil with that

314
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:51,769
blue dream Co easily with a short short

315
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:53,778
veg time we did a one with a real short

316
00:11:51,769 --> 00:11:56,929
veg time last year outdoors that did

317
00:11:53,778 --> 00:11:59,269
like three and a half pounds but the

318
00:11:56,929 --> 00:12:01,250
problem is it doesn't have an appealing

319
00:11:59,269 --> 00:12:03,230
hi to me and it doesn't make enough hash

320
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:05,120
to make it worth its time space energy

321
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:06,560
nutrients whatever else you know what I

322
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,139
mean I could replace that with a Bounty

323
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:10,128
Killer and have way better medicine if

324
00:12:09,139 --> 00:12:12,318
it smelled like it

325
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:14,028
or if it tasted like it smelled would be

326
00:12:12,318 --> 00:12:16,278
the most popular strain in the world

327
00:12:14,028 --> 00:12:18,610
yeah my going to hit it with the

328
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:21,169
Grateful dog was to put that resin on it

329
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:23,000
it worked it definitely worked it made

330
00:12:21,169 --> 00:12:24,649
it i shortened the flowering time it

331
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,208
made the plants a little stockier and it

332
00:12:24,649 --> 00:12:28,669
put some resin and a little bit of funk

333
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:30,109
to it which is what all that's all that

334
00:12:28,669 --> 00:12:31,610
blue dream was missing was resin and

335
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:34,188
funk and it was getting too tall for a

336
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:38,240
lot of indoor grows I bet the DJ short

337
00:12:34,188 --> 00:12:39,528
came out of I mean hit anything with his

338
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:43,430
stuff's always seems to be really

339
00:12:39,528 --> 00:12:45,019
dominant a lot you know it says a lot

340
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:47,778
for his breeding it's because he's

341
00:12:45,019 --> 00:12:49,250
taking it to the five before he releases

342
00:12:47,778 --> 00:12:53,720
his packages which is pretty impressive

343
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:57,078
and he has a style of his own I've heard

344
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:59,569
him argue with many people on podcasts

345
00:12:57,078 --> 00:13:02,528
and interviews yes you know a couple of

346
00:12:59,568 --> 00:13:04,969
minutes ago I dissed the old generation

347
00:13:02,528 --> 00:13:06,948
DJ shorten is the old generation bro we

348
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:08,329
got to give him mad love oh he's one of

349
00:13:06,948 --> 00:13:09,799
the guys back in the day that was doing

350
00:13:08,328 --> 00:13:11,448
it right for genetics if it weren't for

351
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:13,250
DJ Shore I don't think you and I would

352
00:13:11,448 --> 00:13:14,789
be where we are in the cannabis game no

353
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:17,220
I don't think anyone would be

354
00:13:14,789 --> 00:13:20,339
I mean yeah DJ's done a lot for the

355
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:21,870
preservation and just everything it's I

356
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:24,530
might be a brick in the wall but DJ's

357
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:28,110
short was part of the foundation oh yeah

358
00:13:24,529 --> 00:13:29,819
cornerstone yes it's up there with some

359
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:32,940
of the original authors and stuff like

360
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:34,950
that guys like that yeah

361
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:37,920
I'll get some cool mad credit also he's

362
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:39,629
not as old as sub cool or as DJ short

363
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:42,329
but he's in that generation between them

364
00:13:39,629 --> 00:13:43,620
between us and DJ gotta give him mad

365
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:44,940
love for his breeding and for what you

366
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:46,620
did for the community also since we're

367
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:48,630
chef first readers yeah and if we're

368
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:49,230
gonna go with old guys you guys know I'm

369
00:13:48,629 --> 00:13:52,950
gonna say it

370
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:57,060
soma deserves a high five okay so what

371
00:13:52,950 --> 00:14:00,120
taught me how to grow on og I did not

372
00:13:57,059 --> 00:14:01,919
know anything about I'd never I read so

373
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:03,299
most posts but I never realized he was a

374
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:04,740
dreadlock and I never knew he was a

375
00:14:03,299 --> 00:14:07,199
dirty hippie and I didn't know we had

376
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:09,180
amethyst everywhere and crystals on

377
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:13,470
everything I figured he was an Indian

378
00:14:09,179 --> 00:14:16,079
dude the country India yeah and my

379
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:18,660
friend Donovan one day who was a big

380
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:20,639
user of overgrown calm

381
00:14:18,659 --> 00:14:22,469
he was always on there and one day he's

382
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:23,759
like bro you remind me so much of so my

383
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:25,440
the way that you talk because I was

384
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:26,970
preaching my Grove from your heart

385
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,500
theory you know what I mean you own your

386
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:29,730
grow room and I still think this you

387
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,889
gotta go in a grow room once in a while

388
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:33,420
and just sit there and just meditate and

389
00:14:31,889 --> 00:14:34,919
just close your eyes and think about the

390
00:14:33,419 --> 00:14:37,049
goodness that those plants are gonna do

391
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:39,059
because you're growing a plant that is

392
00:14:37,049 --> 00:14:40,469
going to heal somebody in some sort of

393
00:14:39,059 --> 00:14:41,939
way they're gonna feel better even if

394
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:43,680
they're a recreational smoker if they're

395
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:45,690
a medical smoker somebody is gonna be

396
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:47,039
uplifted and better because of the

397
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:49,260
product that you're growing and that's

398
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:50,849
got to feel good inside so I go in there

399
00:14:49,259 --> 00:14:52,679
and kind of meditate a little bit on

400
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:54,779
that and feel that golden we'd share it

401
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:56,219
the plants learn me I love them and then

402
00:14:54,779 --> 00:14:57,899
they heal somebody else and that person

403
00:14:56,220 --> 00:15:01,680
hugs me when they see me the next time

404
00:14:57,899 --> 00:15:03,149
they go do that then I get to go grow

405
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:04,979
better we because I just got a good hug

406
00:15:03,149 --> 00:15:07,559
and it just perpetuates this golden

407
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:08,940
cycle so I was talking about that exact

408
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:10,049
hippie [ __ ] that I just said and my

409
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:12,750
buddies like dude you're like [ __ ]

410
00:15:10,049 --> 00:15:14,609
soma it was like a person read his post

411
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,840
and he's like no go get his book and I

412
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:18,509
went got his book and I was like this

413
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:22,500
guy is who I was going to be in 20 years

414
00:15:18,509 --> 00:15:24,600
if I didn't know I was already on the

415
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:27,120
path of being soma so much respect we

416
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,389
just got off on a random tangent he

417
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:32,139
didn't know two organic

418
00:15:28,389 --> 00:15:34,360
before any of y'all thought of as cool

419
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:34,750
as it is no one's doing nothing new

420
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:39,879
there

421
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:41,919
true yes I built for my kids I built him

422
00:15:39,879 --> 00:15:43,960
out of Rubbermaid containers but I used

423
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:47,469
the same you know principle with the

424
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:50,080
drainage do you think I can support 99%

425
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:51,550
of what psalmist says sub cool I love

426
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,600
his growing style sometimes he says some

427
00:15:51,549 --> 00:15:55,479
shoot that I'm not gonna put my

428
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:56,950
signature on yeah I don't I don't

429
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:59,110
discredit that the dude's got [ __ ]

430
00:15:56,950 --> 00:16:01,330
integrity he's made a lot of strains and

431
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:05,740
he was one of the first people to take

432
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:08,080
good pictures with a good camera buds

433
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:10,090
and send him into High Times anybody

434
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:12,610
that's followed me on Facebook since the

435
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:14,950
beginning knows without any saying that

436
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:21,810
[ __ ] sub cool inspired 50 percent of

437
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:25,030
my photography that's a gross style or

438
00:16:21,809 --> 00:16:26,199
style like the whole thing I didn't know

439
00:16:25,029 --> 00:16:27,819
that until someone's like you should

440
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,800
check out the weed nerd knows like okay

441
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:32,020
there's a lot to learn in some of his

442
00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:34,419
older episodes if you're interested in

443
00:16:32,019 --> 00:16:37,659
the way he does things yeah sub cool on

444
00:16:34,419 --> 00:16:39,370
the youtubes the you to buy some weed

445
00:16:37,659 --> 00:16:41,169
nerds the weed nerd yeah check that out

446
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:43,139
the older stuff is really good there

447
00:16:41,169 --> 00:16:45,819
came a point when it got to be too

448
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:48,519
redundant redundant and he had maybe

449
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:51,460
even yeah even he knows he says it all

450
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:52,569
the time - a hundred episodes and

451
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,680
there's only so much you could talk

452
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:55,120
about about cannabis you know what I

453
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,379
mean like there's always news and stuff

454
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,259
so that's why I fall to the news

455
00:16:56,379 --> 00:17:00,759
sometimes but it's going to be now that

456
00:16:59,259 --> 00:17:02,110
once we get to episode 100 we're gonna

457
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:03,970
go a little more in depth I've gone

458
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:05,860
through the basics and now it's time to

459
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:08,259
dig in a little bit I think our friends

460
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:10,719
our listeners periscope I think that's a

461
00:17:08,259 --> 00:17:12,430
really great tool for a podcast okay so

462
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,500
I've been opening periscope and doing

463
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:16,240
random [ __ ] on there occasionally but

464
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,709
now that we've got this good foundation

465
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,539
you guys have had your basic rudimentary

466
00:17:17,709 --> 00:17:21,430
classes I think it's almost time around

467
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:23,170
episode 100 to start pushing it and

468
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:24,519
start going to the B level courses we're

469
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:26,709
in a college level you guys here pretty

470
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:28,240

471
00:17:26,709 --> 00:17:32,830

472
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:34,059
real ones so we're gonna wrap this part

473
00:17:32,829 --> 00:17:36,369
up we've been doing for a long time dude

474
00:17:34,059 --> 00:17:36,730
Jesse thanks for coming man oh yeah no

475
00:17:36,369 --> 00:17:38,829
problem

476
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:41,680
oh let's see let's do outdoor update

477
00:17:38,829 --> 00:17:42,069
real quick okay here lately in southern

478
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:45,100
collar

479
00:17:42,069 --> 00:17:47,019
at least it has been cold and humid at

480
00:17:45,099 --> 00:17:50,250
night and hot and dry during the day

481
00:17:47,019 --> 00:17:56,049
yeah that is a recipe for powdery mold

482
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:58,359
so bud rot it's part of the reason Cali

483
00:17:56,049 --> 00:18:01,779
bud stands out and they get a marine

484
00:17:58,359 --> 00:18:04,029
layer with this too but you know this

485
00:18:01,779 --> 00:18:06,879
year I've seen some a lot of Cali style

486
00:18:04,029 --> 00:18:08,410
or what I always call Cali style

487
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:12,310
problems that we've never had here

488
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:14,080
before so be prepared for that stuff how

489
00:18:12,309 --> 00:18:15,849
can we prevent getting powdery mildew

490
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:17,169
with these crispy cold nights that we're

491
00:18:15,849 --> 00:18:20,679
getting there's a lot of moisture in the

492
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:21,700
air tonight yeah yeah there's I mean any

493
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:24,340
number of things

494
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:28,600
I'm personally using AK teen ovate I

495
00:18:24,339 --> 00:18:30,579
mean we're in bloom too but it's you

496
00:18:28,599 --> 00:18:32,319
know that's I see it on the cucumbers I

497
00:18:30,579 --> 00:18:36,309
see it on the squash I see it on the

498
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:39,849
watermelon that's a different strain it

499
00:18:36,309 --> 00:18:44,440
doesn't really affect cannabis from what

500
00:18:39,849 --> 00:18:47,049
I've seen and been told but to me it's

501
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:50,110
an indication that the the climate for

502
00:18:47,049 --> 00:18:53,589
to grow is oh yeah this presence yes I

503
00:18:50,109 --> 00:18:55,779
can't speak on that now but in the next

504
00:18:53,589 --> 00:18:57,459
within the next thirty days I am going

518
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:29,620
industry for what nine months and Wow

519
00:19:27,369 --> 00:19:31,329
things have changed yes yes you have to

520
00:19:29,619 --> 00:19:32,799
have Department of Agriculture meetings

521
00:19:31,329 --> 00:19:35,589
there's about an hour and a half long

522
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:38,409
meeting they told us basically what we

523
00:19:35,589 --> 00:19:40,269
need to do to be compliant which is it's

524
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:41,950
all basic stuff and it's mostly since

525
00:19:40,269 --> 00:19:44,500
the spot was designed well it's [ __ ]

526
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:47,440
that we're already doing but you have to

527
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:51,190
have one at least one person on the

528
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:53,650
staff that can train employees on a

529
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:55,240
pesticide and insecticide and fungicide

530
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:57,370
safety

but yeah activate Green cure I don't

562
00:21:20,109 --> 00:21:26,288
really see that as a preventative but if

563
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:30,429
you do use it make sure you use it at

564
00:21:26,288 --> 00:21:32,558
night and follow the directions one of

565
00:21:30,429 --> 00:21:34,778
you know there's all kinds of stuff you

566
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:39,058
can be spraying on it just get it get a

567
00:21:34,778 --> 00:21:42,369
good one to stay away from neem oil

568
00:21:39,058 --> 00:21:46,509
since it's all your plant should be in

569
00:21:42,369 --> 00:21:49,658
bloom yeah I was gifted a product called

570
00:21:46,509 --> 00:21:52,089
stylin oil I've heard of it

571
00:21:49,659 --> 00:21:54,640
I did a consultation and somebody an

572
00:21:52,089 --> 00:21:56,648
older gentleman who is not as

573
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,028
able-bodied as most of us he's a little

574
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:58,658
he's a little slower he might call in

575
00:21:58,028 --> 00:22:00,009
handicapped

576
00:21:58,659 --> 00:22:01,899
he's trying to grow his own cannabis

577
00:22:00,009 --> 00:22:03,339
it's his first grow that's the second

578
00:22:01,898 --> 00:22:04,269
growth and I give him a free

579
00:22:03,339 --> 00:22:05,980
consultation

580
00:22:04,269 --> 00:22:08,230
and he had just the starts of powdery

581
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:08,769
mildew and I was like man I and he was

582
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:12,220
in

583
00:22:08,769 --> 00:22:13,960
about starting week three of flower and

584
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:15,819
I like man I don't really want you to

585
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:18,490
spray anything on there but you're gonna

586
00:22:15,819 --> 00:22:20,679
lose your crop if you don't and he said

587
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:22,299
I googled some stuff and they say oils

588
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:25,539
and things and I said don't put neem oil

589
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:27,909
on there I said put some worm casting

590
00:22:25,539 --> 00:22:31,200
tea on there the world didn't do a damn

591
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:35,350
thing that's most definitely preventive

592
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:37,450
yeah [ __ ] so I told him I said well

593
00:22:35,349 --> 00:22:38,769
you're gonna his crop is gonna be [ __ ]

594
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:40,299
because the powdery mildew was getting

595
00:22:38,769 --> 00:22:41,920
it wasn't thick but you could see it

596
00:22:40,299 --> 00:22:44,740
popping up into little circles ooh and

597
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:46,450
so I said you know I've got a product

598
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:48,549
called stylin oil that I've never used

599
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:50,890
and a friend of mine sent it to me to

600
00:22:48,549 --> 00:22:52,809
encourage me to use it and he said that

601
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:55,000
it will destroy powdery mildew on

602
00:22:52,809 --> 00:22:57,460
contact and he says spray it on there

603
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,049
and he's an old dude I said this is your

604
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:01,750
medicine that you and he said yes I know

605
00:22:59,049 --> 00:23:03,609
I need this spray that on there he knew

606
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:05,769
what I was doing and it was it was his

607
00:23:03,609 --> 00:23:07,599
decision I sprayed the stylet oil on

608
00:23:05,769 --> 00:23:10,150
there dude that [ __ ] took down the

609
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:12,639
powdery mildew on contact it destroyed

610
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:15,040
it nice I've never actually used it I've

611
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,750
heard you can burn the [ __ ] out some

612
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:19,149
plants with it absolutely that's one of

613
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:21,069
the things a guy named I don't know if I

614
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:23,230
should say his real name he's known as

615
00:23:21,069 --> 00:23:24,549
tree town is what I know him as a tree

616
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:25,990
town farmer he's the one that

617
00:23:24,549 --> 00:23:28,299
recommended this to me and hooked me up

618
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:31,059
with a vendor for the product of course

619
00:23:28,299 --> 00:23:32,200
he's like check this out so uh I didn't

620
00:23:31,059 --> 00:23:33,549
well I didn't have anything to use it on

621
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,350
in my grows like I didn't have any

622
00:23:33,549 --> 00:23:36,700
mildew or anything like that so when

623
00:23:35,349 --> 00:23:37,899
this dude was like I got powdery mildews

624
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:40,600
like this is what I've got to offer you

625
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:44,200
and something about the way that it

626
00:23:40,599 --> 00:23:46,509
coats the leaves it causes it breaks the

627
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:48,250
membrane of the powdery mildew and it

628
00:23:46,509 --> 00:23:51,069
doesn't allow it to grow on your leaf is

629
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:52,960
basically what I read and when that [ __ ]

630
00:23:51,069 --> 00:23:55,059
hit the leaf it just washed it right off

631
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:58,029
we do it with the lights off turn the

632
00:23:55,059 --> 00:24:00,039
lights off just turn in normal yeah as

633
00:23:58,029 --> 00:24:01,389
you should with most pesticides actually

634
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:03,700
with any with any spray you want the

635
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:06,940
lighter RFU that you actually need the

636
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:08,740
lights on but sometimes you need to heat

637
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:09,070
the room up do yeah yeah that's what the

638
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,990
deal is

639
00:24:09,069 --> 00:24:13,119
yeah actually need to heat the room to

640
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:15,490
activate the oils and the plants so well

641
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:17,979
we sprayed it with the the the stylet

642
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:19,299
oil and then let it sit overnight and

643
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:21,190
then we went back the next morning and

644
00:24:19,299 --> 00:24:21,740
rinsed the stylet oil off with just

645
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:24,019
clean while

646
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:26,509
also very important yes the most

647
00:24:24,019 --> 00:24:27,798
pesticides yes you want to unclog the

648
00:24:26,509 --> 00:24:30,140
plants they want to be able to breathe

649
00:24:27,798 --> 00:24:31,788
so don't rinse that [ __ ] off and then

650
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:34,159
dude those plants just came out of it

651
00:24:31,788 --> 00:24:35,569
and they're amazing nice yeah you got to

652
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:37,549
harvest his crop this was several weeks

653
00:24:35,569 --> 00:24:38,778
ago he got to harvest his crop I looked

654
00:24:37,548 --> 00:24:39,829
at it I helped him trim something I

655
00:24:38,778 --> 00:24:42,048
showed him how to trim it

656
00:24:39,829 --> 00:24:44,269
no signs of powdery mildew gorgeous

657
00:24:42,048 --> 00:24:46,190
crops smelled pretty good I haven't

658
00:24:44,269 --> 00:24:48,829
smoked any of it so I don't know if it

659
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:50,480
tastes like stylet oil but he's an older

660
00:24:48,829 --> 00:24:52,490
cat he's been he's like your dad you

661
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,589
know just needs a bunch of herb to smoke

662
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:56,990
so he doesn't get hurt what what is mine

663
00:24:54,589 --> 00:24:58,970
stylin oil I think that's a hybrid it's

664
00:24:56,990 --> 00:25:00,230
you know I don't have it in this room I

665
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:01,909
should have had it handy before I

666
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:05,839
brought it up but I wasn't prepared for

667
00:25:01,909 --> 00:25:07,309
that so fail on my part oil yeah I did

668
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:09,319
some research on it once and I said

669
00:25:07,308 --> 00:25:11,028
white it's not it's not colored white

670
00:25:09,319 --> 00:25:12,619
it's just considered a white oil it's

671
00:25:11,028 --> 00:25:14,690
not thick and white or anything nice

672
00:25:12,619 --> 00:25:17,449
yeah when I heard about it it was kind

673
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:20,298
of pre Amazon times I just couldn't get

674
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:21,620
my hands on it yeah it's it's available

675
00:25:20,298 --> 00:25:23,658
now and it's cheap it's actually quite

676
00:25:21,619 --> 00:25:24,979
affordable so smooth as a preventative

677
00:25:23,659 --> 00:25:26,419
as an outdoor if you need to rescue

678
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:28,669
something it's something you could look

679
00:25:26,419 --> 00:25:31,340
into and drink your if you hit it just

680
00:25:28,669 --> 00:25:34,730
right we'll we'll take care of a light

681
00:25:31,339 --> 00:25:37,099
infestation but it's kind of touchy too

682
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:38,960
right it's anything when you're in the

683
00:25:37,099 --> 00:25:41,629
flowering phase and applying a foliar

684
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:44,750
spray of any type is a touchy so such de

685
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:47,510
leafing just removing the leaf of and

686
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:50,179
taking it out of the area washing your

687
00:25:47,509 --> 00:25:52,490
hands don't touch them when they're when

688
00:25:50,179 --> 00:25:56,169
it's wet that's actually I've been told

689
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:59,558
it spreads easier at that point so okay

690
00:25:56,169 --> 00:26:01,909
that's something I've been told so I

691
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:06,019
would believe it I haven't been able to

692
00:26:01,909 --> 00:26:07,970
put that to work too much but yeah I

693
00:26:06,019 --> 00:26:09,440
haven't had a need to if you've got

694
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:11,450
powdery mildew in your grow room you've

695
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,679
got something to correct in the room and

696
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:14,360
you've got some work to do it's gonna

697
00:26:12,679 --> 00:26:16,220
take you a little bit to fix that you

698
00:26:14,359 --> 00:26:18,048
cannot spray away that problem yeah

699
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:19,788
there's an environmental problem gotta

700
00:26:18,048 --> 00:26:21,679
clean it you get started getting fresh

701
00:26:19,788 --> 00:26:23,269
air out of the refresher into the room

702
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:26,149
stealer out of the room lower the

703
00:26:23,269 --> 00:26:27,769
humidity but if you get it all so don't

704
00:26:26,148 --> 00:26:30,619
feel bad I mean it can even happen

705
00:26:27,769 --> 00:26:31,829
outdoors happens yeah yeah I was talked

706
00:26:30,619 --> 00:26:33,418
about having it in a grow

707
00:26:31,829 --> 00:26:35,788
it happened the first time I moved into

708
00:26:33,419 --> 00:26:37,769
a new house it was August when I moved

709
00:26:35,788 --> 00:26:40,710
in so it was warm and then that first

710
00:26:37,769 --> 00:26:41,940
winter crop I got powdery mildew was in

711
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:44,548
the back corner of the room because it

712
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:47,070
was the concrete basement walls drastic

713
00:26:44,548 --> 00:26:48,329
climate change season changes yes easier

714
00:26:47,069 --> 00:26:49,589
to run that room in the fall probably

715
00:26:48,329 --> 00:26:57,269
wasn't prepared for that

716
00:26:49,589 --> 00:27:00,720
yeah mildew boom experience don't I've

717
00:26:57,269 --> 00:27:03,538
been told that when I talk about powdery

718
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:06,000
mold and both of us have been told that

719
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:08,099
we make people feel bad so don't feel

720
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:12,750
bad if it happens now you guys the

721
00:27:08,099 --> 00:27:15,408
person at the store told me that it's

722
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:17,759
because I just don't take pictures nails

723
00:27:15,409 --> 00:27:20,370
you never take a picture your poops do

724
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:21,690

730
00:27:28,829 --> 00:27:31,648
the next time I make a mistake I'll get

731
00:27:30,329 --> 00:27:34,888
out the camera and I'll own that [ __ ]

732
00:27:31,648 --> 00:27:40,259
this is my dumbness right when I get

733
00:27:34,888 --> 00:27:41,759
lazy straight into the floor only a

734
00:27:40,259 --> 00:27:46,259
couple of gallons of water but still

735
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:47,879
when you hear that [ __ ] overflow just

736
00:27:46,259 --> 00:27:51,869
totally focused on what I was doing and

737
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:53,669
I heard oh [ __ ] you just sit there and

738
00:27:51,869 --> 00:27:55,379
you feel like a slow kid have to take

739
00:27:53,669 --> 00:27:58,860
the short bus to work tomorrow after

740
00:27:55,380 --> 00:28:01,289
this [ __ ] I was with some people that uh

741
00:27:58,859 --> 00:28:03,569
in the early days we were Phil and

742
00:28:01,288 --> 00:28:10,619
Reza's and took off to lunch and went to

743
00:28:03,569 --> 00:28:12,808
the bar had a couple beers came back two

744
00:28:10,619 --> 00:28:15,168
and a half hours later and water was

745
00:28:12,808 --> 00:28:15,168
still running

746
00:28:15,829 --> 00:28:22,558
it was luckily it was a big like an old

747
00:28:20,278 --> 00:28:25,019
mechanic shop just a big steel building

748
00:28:22,558 --> 00:28:27,329
with a roll-up door on one side this was

749
00:28:25,019 --> 00:28:30,089
still real early days it was most

750
00:28:27,329 --> 00:28:33,629
definitely Trap House worthy but uh it

751
00:28:30,089 --> 00:28:35,759
was a early legal girl it was fun we

752
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:38,370
just roll up the door and I was a blast

753
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:40,169
back then yeah back in the day you could

754
00:28:38,369 --> 00:28:43,209
do all kinds of dumb [ __ ] that you can

755
00:28:40,169 --> 00:28:45,490
do no [ __ ]

756
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:47,559
smoked in the grove while your girl like

757
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:49,450
we had our grow and our dispensary was

758
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:51,700
attached they were one floor was the

759
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:54,190
grow one floor was the dispensary and so

760
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:55,509
I would be I'd have we had a camera of

761
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:56,680
course with the monitor up there so I

762
00:28:55,509 --> 00:28:58,839
could just look at the monitor and hear

763
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:01,269
the doorbell so I've been water similar

764
00:28:58,839 --> 00:29:03,369
situation smoking a fat joint just water

765
00:29:01,269 --> 00:29:04,480
plants living my life got reggae on and

766
00:29:03,369 --> 00:29:05,709
then you hear the doorbell just run

767
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:12,390
downstairs I wouldn't even put up the

768
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:17,819
joint I've seen barefoot and shirtless

769
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:17,820
felons working in a felons running them

770
00:29:18,509 --> 00:29:23,259
with like little hippie drawings and

771
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:24,849
colors like my girlfriend did it and

772
00:29:23,259 --> 00:29:26,980
[ __ ] because that's how it was done

773
00:29:24,849 --> 00:29:28,869
there was nothing printed on a printer

774
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:30,730
back in the day there's no bar code on

775
00:29:28,869 --> 00:29:32,889
any weed product it was all just grown

776
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:35,259
in someone's basement or upstairs from

777
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:36,700
the from the dispensary then trimming

778
00:29:35,259 --> 00:29:38,650
that brought right immediately to the

779
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:40,840
grow or to the dispensary put in a jar

780
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:42,850
and sold and just what do you mean we

781
00:29:40,839 --> 00:29:45,579
had some weed just surviving it money

782
00:29:42,849 --> 00:29:50,589
and despite all that certain shops still

783
00:29:45,579 --> 00:29:53,949
just boom had the fire I used to be

784
00:29:50,589 --> 00:29:56,829
better I do I think it is the dispensary

785
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:59,350
grows a lot of the growers grow was like

786
00:29:56,829 --> 00:30:01,449
honest I used to grow I worked at madam

787
00:29:59,349 --> 00:30:02,799
our dispensary I was the manager my

788
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:04,450
friend Tom was the owner I was the

789
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:06,099
manager right underneath him

790
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:07,299
Tom handed me the keys one day and he

791
00:30:06,099 --> 00:30:09,939
was like here you got a dispensary have

792
00:30:07,299 --> 00:30:11,680
fun he paid me very well so I've worked

793
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:15,460
at this dispensary and I would grow

794
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:17,289
cherry widow at home in my own home Russ

795
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:20,079
and then I would take that cherry widow

796
00:30:17,289 --> 00:30:22,539
to the shop and sell it to the boss for

797
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:24,609
a decent price put it on the shelf and

798
00:30:22,539 --> 00:30:27,460
that was the most fire we we had in

799
