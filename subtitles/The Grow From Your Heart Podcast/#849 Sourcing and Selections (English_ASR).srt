00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:29,199
way the pet peeve goes a little bit like

59
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,239
this it says hey Ross to Jeff I for sure

60
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:33,280

61
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:35,480
Growers can relate to and yes bro I

62
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,800
definitely connected on this one uh made

63
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:39,199
me chuckle I had a conversation recently

64
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,159
uh with a friend about this I had a

65
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:42,919
friend who bought a fat sack of good

66
00:02:41,158 --> 00:02:44,400
herb and they were a victim of what

67
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:46,839
you're about to talk about anyway the

68
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:50,319
question says I hate seeing beautiful

69
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:53,400
dense nugs with dog or cat hair all over

70
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:55,839
them pet hair is our enemy as a grower

71
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:58,158
yes absolutely a friend of mine recently

72
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,400
bought some really good weed except uh

73
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:02,239
about 78 of that weed is coated in

74
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,719
kitten hair so yes that can definitely

75
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,319
ruin a good bag of good weed uh it's all

76
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:07,840
Frosty green it's got bright orange

77
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:10,119
hairs it's covered in tricomes and he

78
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,360
turn that nugget over and there's a big

79
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:14,319
sticky lump of cat hair on there I've

80
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,319
definitely taken great photos in my own

81
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:18,119
garden I've been in there super proud of

82
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:20,238
the nugs I'm in there taking nug shots I

83
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,120
take a picture I'm excited I bring it to

84
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,439
the computer I throw the disc into the

85
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,200
computer I load the image up on the

86
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:27,120
computer and it's a really nice nug shot

87
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:29,119
with one [ __ ] dog hair right down the

88
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,360
middle of it been there so many times

89
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,920
I've done that I do not have a pet at

90
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,280
this time but I do plan to acquire a new

91
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:36,679
dog in the near future there are some

92
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,680
steps in front of that but there will be

93
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:40,040
a new dog when the new dog does come

94
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,680
into the world I will have to make

95
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:43,679
adjustments I'll have to reconfigure the

96
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,319
grow so there's more filtration to make

97
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,438
sure the dog hair does not make it too

98
00:03:45,318 --> 00:03:49,399
there also I will have to change clothes

99
00:03:47,438 --> 00:03:51,878
more frequently when going in and out of

100
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:53,760
the grow space to avoid that dog hair uh

101
00:03:51,878 --> 00:03:55,518
from being moved into the grow but yes

102
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:56,798
my dude uh I'm just going to call you

103
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,200

104
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,159

photo or any kind of product and there's

109
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,640
a dog or a cat hair in it that is almost

110
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:13,158
a heartbreaker it almost makes you want

111
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:14,919
to cry it's so near Perfection and then

112

00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:18,918

I really like it says I just bought a

164
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,519
tester pack and I'm curious as to where

165
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:08,959
your original lineage comes from for

166
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:11,079
your selections like what beans or cuts

167
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:14,239
are your go-to when you are trying to

168
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:16,120
find a new strain uh as a breeder that

169
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,519
is a very fun question that's a very uh

170
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,439
opening question and gives me a lot of

171
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:21,719
stuff to talk about so basically this

172
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:24,439
person is asking how do I acquire new

173
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:26,120
seeds or new clones or new plants for my

174
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:28,038
breeding projects where do these plants

175
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:30,079
come from how do I make the decisions

176
00:06:28,038 --> 00:06:32,159
where to get them what to use this is a

177
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:34,598
very great great question as a seed

178
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,439
breeder as a seed maker as a plant lover

179
00:06:34,598 --> 00:06:38,918
uh this definitely opens me up to a lot

180
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:40,598
of conversation so where do my plants

181
00:06:38,918 --> 00:06:43,279
come from that I choose to breed with my

182
00:06:40,598 --> 00:06:46,279
clones my seeds my cuting uh where does

183
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:49,239
all of this come from they come from a

184
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:51,799
plethora of different places and sources

185
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:54,759
if you will um let's talk about I've got

186
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:56,038
a sort of a list here of things um let's

187
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:58,879
see the first one that I've got written

188
00:06:56,038 --> 00:07:01,839
down is Cherry Paloma uh Cherry Paloma

189
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:04,120
was almost forced upon me uh when Cherry

190
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:05,839
Paloma became popular two different

191
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:07,120
people sent me the Cherry Paloma cut

192
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:08,318
they're like hey bro I really think you

193
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,079
should breed with this and you should

194
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:12,080
work with this and I was like ah it

195
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:13,598
seems okay I might work with that I put

196
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:14,878
one out in a greenhouse it didn't make

197
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:17,159
it that plant got destroyed that

198
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:18,960
Greenhouse got hit by a storm uh that

199
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,199
cherry Paloma plant was murdered out

200
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:21,918
there I thought it was gone and then

201
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:23,199
guess what somebody else was like hey do

202
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:25,198
you have the Cherry Paloma and I was

203
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,598
like No And they sent it to me and then

204
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,280
another friend of mine in my close

205
00:07:26,598 --> 00:07:29,639
breeding circle in my group came to me

206
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:32,399
one day he's like hey bro I got my my

207
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:35,079
hands on this Jr's cut of cherry Paloma

208
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:36,959
so it felt like Cherry Paloma was almost

209
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:39,560
forced upon me it was like the universe

210
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:41,719
the weed world I listened also the world

211
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:43,280
was like take this plant do something

212
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,560
great with this and I did I've done a

213
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:46,878
couple of great things with the Cherry

214
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,839
Paloma we made the Cherry skunk I've

215
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:51,158
also crossed it to the BC Lemon Skunk uh

216
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:52,439
I will talk about those in the near

217
00:07:51,158 --> 00:07:56,079
future maybe those will be on the

218
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:57,560
testing uh the testing table soon but

219
00:07:56,079 --> 00:08:00,560
that is where the Cherry Paloma came

220
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:02,360
from um three different people mailed me

221
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,839
cuts of the Cherry Paloma and then

222
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,560
somebody else a different Source

223
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:08,079
actually mailed one of my very best

224
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:10,158
friends another cut of the Cherry Paloma

225
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:11,959
so over time I had four different cuts

226
00:08:10,158 --> 00:08:14,279
of the same plant arrive at my growing

227
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:16,560
areas and it was like a sign it was a

228
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:18,478
sign from the weed gods or whatever God

229
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,918
you believe in it was a sign as said hey

230
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:23,399
rosta Jeff put this in the mix so Cherry

231
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:25,878
Paloma is a fun one to start with um I

232
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:28,959
get a lot of cuts from my friends uh

233
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:31,280
locally and not so locally and also I

234
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:33,158
work worked in commercial cultivation

235
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:35,439
facilities where I would see a lot of

236
00:08:33,158 --> 00:08:37,599
Great Cuts one good thing about working

237
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,800
in a commercial grow no offense to you

238
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,680
guys working there but uh those guys are

239
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:43,439
overworked sometimes there's two or

240
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,879
three dudes running a giant Warehouse

241
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,040
they're overworked the plants get

242
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:49,120
overlooked sometimes if they're focused

243
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:51,759
on room a room B may not even get

244
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,839
touched all day some of the plants get

245
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:55,639
slightly abused they get beat up in

246
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:58,120
there and I get to go to that facility

247
00:08:55,639 --> 00:09:00,399
and see which plants handled the stress

248
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,839
uh which plants are not getting the pest

249
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:03,679
maybe the whole room got spidermites

250
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,079
there's one section that didn't get it

251
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:06,199
I'm going to keep my eye on that plant

252
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:07,559
try to remember these don't get

253
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,600
spidermites those might go into my

254
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:11,599
breeding projects later but I pay

255
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,600
attention in the commercial facility

256
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,639
watching these young dudes [ __ ] these

257
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,639
plants up for nine weeks and then I get

258
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:19,759
to see at the end of that 9we abuse what

259
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:21,439
comes out real well and how things react

260
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:23,159
to that abuse sometimes they

261
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,839
accidentally get overwatered sometimes

262
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:26,639
they accidentally get underwatered

263
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:28,720
sometimes they get bugs sometimes it

264
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:30,159
gets too hot sometimes it gets too cold

265
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,480
sometimes everything goes freaking

266
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:35,078
perfectly I get to see how these plants

267
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,560
in large numbers react in that sort of

268
00:09:35,078 --> 00:09:38,799
environment with those sort of

269
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:41,159
conditions and so in multiple cases and

270
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:42,919
multiple occasions I've acquired cuts

271
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:44,439
from those commercial facilities to add

272
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:47,719
to my breeding projects I've written

273
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:50,480
down a couple of those um the Platinum

274
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:52,839
Tangi and the Strawberry Fields cut that

275
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,519
I have both came from a commercial

276
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:59,440
cultivation facility in Pueblo West

277
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:01,560
Colorado um the Platinum Tangi was just

278
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,320
a great cut it was vigorous it was hyper

279
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:06,199
vigorous it grew very quickly it could

280
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:08,040
handle a lot of problems uh we had one

281
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:10,000
room with an air conditioner intake that

282
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:12,000
in the winter a lot of cool air would

283
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,559
come in there it would mess up a lot of

284
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,879
plants I knew if I put that Platinum

285
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:17,439
Tangi up against that section they'd be

286
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:19,799
just fine those plants were super

287
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,880
resilient they handled all of the stress

288
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:24,278
so when it was time I acquired a cut of

289
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:26,240
that Platinum Tangi uh also that

290
00:10:24,278 --> 00:10:28,480
Strawberry Fields that I got came from

291
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,879
the same commercial facility I watched

292
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:33,800
that plant tolerate all types of abuse

293
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:36,399
and bang out gigantic strawberry candy

294
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:38,799
flavored buds with high potency all day

295
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:41,519
long I had to get a cut of that uh the

296
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:43,759
Platinum Tangi made um it made orange

297
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:46,000
gasm it also made sunkiss it's made

298
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:47,759
other things the strawberry Starburst

299
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,958
cut ended up or the Strawberry Fields

300
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:52,200
cut made strawberry Starburst Raphael um

301
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:54,319
probably other things that I can't think

302
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:56,839
of off the The Red Pill came from that

303
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,440
one so that's where that one came from

304
00:10:56,839 --> 00:11:00,079
uh another popular cut that I work with

305
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:02,120
a lot is the gold goat where did I get

306
00:11:00,078 --> 00:11:05,958
the Golden Goat I've had the Golden Goat

307
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:08,078
since probably 2008 or 9 2010 at the

308
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:10,278
latest I'm going to say it's in Circa

309
00:11:08,078 --> 00:11:12,879
2009 I guess is kind of where I think it

310
00:11:10,278 --> 00:11:15,078
fell in but uh there was a dispensary up

311
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:17,360
north that sold Golden Goat flowers all

312
00:11:15,078 --> 00:11:19,919
the time and the flowers were always

313
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:23,240
fire uh super good wheat it was super

314
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:24,679
potent um it always tastes real nice and

315
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:26,879
I just love the flavor and the buzz of

316
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:29,319
the Golden Goat one day A friend of mine

317
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:30,879
came to me um we're going to call him uh

318
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,399
Pineapple Express he happened to be from

319
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:34,278
Hawaii he was a really cool dude really

320
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,000
good grower really good friend uh

321
00:11:34,278 --> 00:11:38,000

322
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,480
anyway he came to me he said hey do you

323
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,600

324
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,159
said yeah I know that guy I don't think

325
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:44,120
he likes me and he goes oh no he [ __ ]

326
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:45,360
hates you for some reason and that's a

327
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,759
totally different story it doesn't

328
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,879
matter why I don't even care why that

329
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:50,559
guy didn't like me I sold weed at the

330
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:53,679
time he sold weed at the time I had all

331
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:56,078
the good customers he didn't like me um

332
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:58,039
he gave my buddy Pineapple Express a cut

333
00:11:56,078 --> 00:11:59,638
of Golden Goat and he's like I will give

334
00:11:58,039 --> 00:12:01,679
you this Golden Goat as long as you

335
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:03,200
don't give it to Jeff you know how

336
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:04,838
things go in this community my buddy was

337
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,360
like sure thing we'll do that and he

338
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:08,200
took the cut guess what he did drove it

339
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:10,600
straight to me so that's how I acquired

340
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:12,040
the Golden Goat that was kind of a uh

341
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,399
there was multiple reasons there first

342
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:14,719
of all that dude was a dick and said

343
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:16,519
don't give it to me and my buddy was

344
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,639
like haha and he brought it to me that

345
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:20,240
was just kind of a spite move also my

346
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,959
buddy knew that I was a good grower one

347
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,039
of the uh the known growers in town

348
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:25,599
somebody that should have that good cut

349
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:27,159
I got it and I grew it a few times and I

350
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,680
realized that Golden Goat was special

351
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:30,639
and that's why it got into my breeding

352
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:31,958
project um a lot of people in other

353
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,079
places were like it's not fair that

354
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:35,838
you've got that Golden Goat I'm I've got

355
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:37,838
cancer I've got other problems also I'd

356
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,880
love to have that cut it maybe medicinal

357
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:42,079
for me so that inspired me to make it

358
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:43,559
into fem seeds and ship it everywhere so

359
00:12:42,078 --> 00:12:46,559
that's how Golden Goat fem seeds got

360
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:49,078
made and put out um where are we now the

361
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:52,000
Medusa many of you don't even know about

362
00:12:49,078 --> 00:12:55,559
Medusa what the heck is Medusa Medusa is

363
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:59,399
a 16w we flowering sativa that will

364
00:12:55,559 --> 00:13:00,958
knock your socks off um it doesn't make

365
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:03,720
me high it doesn't make me stoned it

366
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:05,759
makes me feel bent or crooked or it

367
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:07,480
makes me feel like I did different drugs

368
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:09,600
it's I don't know it does weird [ __ ] to

369
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:11,278
my brain it's pleasant but it can be a

370
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,959
lot sometimes if you're a smoker that

371
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:15,720
really wants to go to another planet and

372
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:17,799
try something new uh Medusa will get you

373
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:21,278
there fortunately I have crossed the

374
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:23,159
Medusa to the Afterglow I made feminized

375
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:25,078
seeds and I call that Wings suit I call

376
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:26,679
a wing suit cuz when you smoke it it's

377
00:13:25,078 --> 00:13:28,159
like you just jumped off the [ __ ]

378
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:29,559
roof of a building and you spread your

379
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:30,919
wings and you were hoping for the

380
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:32,679
[ __ ] best that's what it's like when

381
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:34,120
you smoke this [ __ ] you'll sit at the

382
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:35,399
chair and wonder about life and your

383
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:37,519
heart will just race and you'll be

384
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:39,559
sweaty uh you'll burn calories by

385
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:41,320
smoking this weed just chilling out so

386
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:44,919
the wing suit takes about 14 weeks to

387
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:48,000
flower Medusa is like 16 17 weeks um

388
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:50,240
that cut came from a friend of mine who

389
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,879
wants nothing to do with the weed world

390
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,399
he wants to grow and breed good cannabis

391
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:56,120
and that's what he wants to do that's

392
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,278
his contribution to the weed world is he

393
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:59,839
gives us good plants to play with he

394
00:13:58,278 --> 00:14:01,320
doesn't want to be on social media he

395
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,800
doesn't want any Spotlight that's not

396
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:05,639
what he's about he's a businessman he's

397
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:07,198
a family man in other Realms he uh he

398
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:09,000
hides in the shadows he was he's like

399
00:14:07,198 --> 00:14:11,159
bane of the weed World he's born in the

400
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,120
shadows but that dude breeds some

401
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:14,639
amazing stuff and he gave me a cut of

402
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,600
the Medusa he's a really good friend of

403
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,680
mine also shout out bro I hope you see

404
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,278
this podcast um you know who you are I

405
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:22,879
don't even need to say your name he gave

406
00:14:20,278 --> 00:14:25,078
me the Medusa cut and I breed with that

407
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:27,120
because um it adds diversity to my

408
00:14:25,078 --> 00:14:29,198
breeding mix most of my stuff is sativa

409
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,440
dominant candy flavored but the Medusa

410
00:14:29,198 --> 00:14:33,120
got a really unique sort of a buzz to it

411
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,519
um it's a different sort of a buzz than

412
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,959
what comes with most of my lineup it's

413
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:38,799
more paranoia inducing it's I I can't

414
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:40,518
even explain it properly most of the

415
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:42,919
time I'm high or I'm stoned and this one

416
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:44,560
is I'm bent and crooked and I don't know

417
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:47,000
I'm trying to park my car in motorcycle

418
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:49,439
spaces and losing my sunglasses while

419
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I'm wearing them and [ __ ] like that uh

420
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,839
that but that that my friends is the

421
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
wing suit and the Medusa I'm going to

422
00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:55,920
keep going I'm going to try to stay

423
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,799
focused obviously I've been taking a lot

424
00:14:55,919 --> 00:15:00,919
of dabs today another one to talk about

425
00:14:57,799 --> 00:15:03,278
is the cream where does my cream breeder

426
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:05,599
cut come from that's crazy random right

427
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:07,240
I made the cream I bred the cream seeds

428
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,680
I've been making cream seeds for quite a

429
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:11,720
while that is the cookies and cream

430
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:13,479
number 13 to arise I named it the cream

431
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:15,560
because the cream Rises to the top

432
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:18,399
cookies and cream arise cream Rising the

433
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:21,000
cream bro so I got the name the cream is

434
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:23,198
an amazing plant I've seen uh so many

435
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,879
people send me amazing pictures of the

436
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:27,519
cream it's frosty it's chunky it grows

437
00:15:25,879 --> 00:15:30,278
very well it's got amazing flavors and

438
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:32,839
Aromas the buzz is very desirable

439
00:15:30,278 --> 00:15:34,799
recently I gave a friend some seeds of

440
00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:36,560
the cream and many other seeds and he

441
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:37,758
ran them in his grow locally in my

442
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:39,039
neighborhood right down the street I

443
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:42,278
pointed right there like you guys knew

444
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:43,759
where his house was I hope you don't but

445
00:15:42,278 --> 00:15:45,639
my dude grew a bunch of seeds for me

446
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:47,639
locally right down the street I got to

447
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:48,919
go over there every three or four days

448
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:50,159
he's my homie I just go over there and

449
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:51,838
smoke and hang out and look at his

450
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:53,318
plants and check on him and see how the

451
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,279
day was going just kill some time over

452
00:15:53,318 --> 00:15:57,639
there and stare into the plants uh like

453
00:15:55,278 --> 00:16:00,318
Hank Hill and [ __ ] Dale Gribble just

454
00:15:57,639 --> 00:16:02,959
yep you got plants we just stare at him

455
00:16:00,318 --> 00:16:05,159
but we found he found he grew a cut of

456
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:07,039
the cream he grew a seed of the cream

457
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:08,799
that was amazing luckily we got clones

458
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:11,000
of it I've got a clone he's got a clone

459
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:12,599
also it's backed up in two spots uh

460
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,958
that's his cut but he was nice enough to

461
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,360
give me a clone of the cream um I

462
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:18,439
promised him when I breed to it he'll

463
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:20,159
get some seeds back from it but I have

464
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:22,959
got a cut of the cream that came from a

465
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:25,480
local friend that is phenomenal it will

466
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:26,919
be in my breeding uh rotation very soon

467
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:29,000
you'll see it as a pollen donor you'll

468
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:31,198
see it as a pollen receiver the new

469
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,559
cream cut that we recently found is I

470
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:35,278
want to say hot fire but it's frosty

471
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:37,479
cool this one is Frosty cool it's

472
00:16:35,278 --> 00:16:40,639
covered in tricomes the structure is

473
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:43,199
real nice the color is beautiful um the

474
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:45,198
turps are mostly there but the turps are

475
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:46,519
not overpowering to where I think so

476
00:16:45,198 --> 00:16:48,318
what's real what it's all it's really

477
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:50,679
missing is powerful turps it tastes good

478
00:16:48,318 --> 00:16:52,198
it smells good but it's not like shabow

479
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:54,239
I think when I breed that to some of my

480
00:16:52,198 --> 00:16:56,879
more flavorful females that will leave

481
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:59,480
room for that structure that Vigor that

482
00:16:56,879 --> 00:17:01,480
potency that triome content The Leaf

483
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:03,159
color um then we're going to get flavor

484
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:05,120
from everybody else is what I'm really

485
00:17:03,159 --> 00:17:06,480
hoping for so we'll leave some room for

486
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,798
those ladies to do some work in the

487
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,679
breeding project but that's where the

488
00:17:07,798 --> 00:17:13,240
Cream came from I do have more um on the

489
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:15,798
list also I've got AJ Sour Diesel I've

490
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:17,599
got AJ Sour Diesel AJ's cut I've got a

491
00:17:15,798 --> 00:17:19,759
couple other Sour Diesel Cuts but right

492
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:22,240
now we're going to focus on the AJ sour

493
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:25,000
and Kosher Kush where did I get AJ sour

494
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,838
and Kosher Kush um I've been smoking

495
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,240
those strains for years I love those

496
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:31,759
cuts those are awesome I honestly got

497
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:34,079
them from reputable clone vendors in the

498
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:35,599
Colorado area I knew people back in the

499
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:37,319
day that sold clones they'd give you a

500
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:40,038
menu they'd say we got these the Clones

501
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:41,759
are somewhere between 10 and $10,000 a

502
00:17:40,038 --> 00:17:43,240
cut depending on what you want to buy

503
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:44,440

504

505
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:49,558

506
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:51,679

507
00:17:49,558 --> 00:17:54,558
amazing Cuts I love those you will see

508
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:57,440
those in the breeding uh very soon so

509
00:17:54,558 --> 00:18:01,119
there are a lot of avenues and ways that

510
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:03,320
I acquire clones also so um I buy seeds

511
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:05,399
and clones off of websites just like

512
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:07,558
normal civilians I'm not afraid to go to

513
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:09,000
a website and if I heard about something

514
00:18:07,558 --> 00:18:10,480
that I want and it gets my attention

515
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,079
I'll go find it on the internet and buy

516
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,319
it just like a normal customer I'm a

517
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:16,240
customer I'm a a civilian I'm a shopper

518
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:17,879
just like you guys I like to go buy new

519
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:21,038
[ __ ] and add it to my repertoire but

520
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:23,600
also uh people love to send me random

521
00:18:21,038 --> 00:18:25,679
seeds and clones I've got a box I can

522
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:27,759
see it it's a box that sits on my table

523
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,559
uh it is a small lunch box just filled

524
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:31,519
with seeds that people have given me

525
00:18:29,558 --> 00:18:33,480
that I do want to grow eventually but

526
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:35,679
I've got so many seeds that it's not

527
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:38,159
possible within my lifetime to grow out

528
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:40,519
all these seeds but people love to send

529
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:42,679
me seeds and they love to send me clones

530
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:44,079
like I said that cherry Paloma just kept

531
00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:45,720
popping up couldn't get rid of the

532
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:47,480
Cherry Paloma so I did take the hint

533
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:49,079
ladies and gentlemen I did uh listen to

534
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:51,519
the universe I did breed with it I made

535
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:53,519
some great [ __ ] with the Cherry Paloma

536
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:55,079
um if you bred with cherry Paloma are

537
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:56,879
you seeing a couple of mutants are you

538
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:59,000
seeing weird Offspring and anything that

539
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,679
came from the Cherry Paloma just curious

540
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,919
let's talk as breeder friends post your

541
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:04,320
pictures send them to me let me know

542
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:06,640
what you think so where was I I buy and

543
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:08,319
trade seeds and [ __ ] also um if you've

544
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,919
got some cool seeds and I may be

545
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:11,798
interested in them and I've got some

546
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:13,480
cool [ __ ] I'm open to Trad sometimes

547
00:19:11,798 --> 00:19:15,720
don't be offended if I don't want your

548
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:17,200
stuff but there is some stuff that's

549
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,839
hard to find that I was looking for and

550
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,159
I also will trade clones if it's the

551
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:22,519
right clone my inbox is going to [ __ ]

552
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:25,640
blow up because of that and in the

553
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:27,200
future I do intend to sell a few clones

554
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:30,120
on IE Direct that's right we'll be

555
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:32,120
selling a few clones on um very minimal

556
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:34,119
clones at premium prices because it will

557
00:19:32,119 --> 00:19:36,000
be just me handling everything I tried

558
00:19:34,119 --> 00:19:37,759
to sell clones before with help I did

559
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,279
not like the way it went I want to do it

560
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:41,839
myself I will uh cut the Clone I will

561
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:43,240
package the Clone I will ship the Clone

562
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:45,279
it will all be me so that when there's a

563
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:47,079
complaint it's [ __ ] on me last time I

564
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:49,399
had a helper didn't go the way we hoped

565
00:19:47,079 --> 00:19:51,439
for I apologize now I'm talking in the

566
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:53,080
weeds all right where are we um I buy

567
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,880
seeds off the internet I buy clones off

568
00:19:53,079 --> 00:19:56,960
the internet I buy clones sometimes from

569
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,240
dispensaries if I'm somewhere sometimes

570
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,279
a friend of mine will just give me a

571
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,480
really Killer cut as a breeder something

572
00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:04,319
I appreciate and enjoy if you grow a

573
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,839

574
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:08,798
Killer cut um I would love it if you

575

the Afterglow she found a [ __ ]

586
00:20:29,038 --> 00:20:33,679

601
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,519
have we been going we're about 20

602
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:01,400
minutes in with some edits all right we

603
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:02,879
do have time for another question but

604
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:05,600
before we go that far I want to send my

605
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:07,520
buddy Doug a big thank you Doug um I

606
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:10,038
hope I rambled on and explained how I

607
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:12,400
got my cuts uh that is how I find seeds

608
00:21:10,038 --> 00:21:14,278
and cuts I am just places where they are

609
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,720
people send them to me I buy them on the

610
00:21:14,278 --> 00:21:19,400
Internet just like a shopper uh luckily

611
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,880
I'm in Colorado I know clone vendors

612
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:22,400
sometimes uh people send me a text

613
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,278
message with like just 10 things on

614
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,840
there like I got these you interested

615
00:21:24,278 --> 00:21:27,599
and I'll say sure I want this one and

616
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:29,678
this one and then suddenly those clones

617
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:31,240
just appear how do I choose to breed

618
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:33,080
with them is a totally different story I

619
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,359
need to run those in my environment

620
00:21:33,079 --> 00:21:37,240
before I'm going to choose to breed with

621
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:38,719
them 99% of the time uh sometimes like

622
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:41,240
the the strawberry and the Platinum

623
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,759
Tangi I grew that so many times that I

624
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:44,480
just brought it home and we we [ __ ]

625
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:46,079
with that right away but most of the

626
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,599
time it comes to the personal grow I

627
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:49,359
grow it out a couple of times see what

628
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:50,480
it does then I'll spread it around to

629
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:52,678
the homies and we'll put it in some

630
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:55,200
breeding tents but I think I answered

631
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:57,000
that one quite uh in depth so my buddy

632
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,159

00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:25,759
out to my new friend zany in Michigan

646
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:27,320
also big shout out to all the Growers

647
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:29,240
out there in Michigan killing it holding

648
00:22:27,319 --> 00:22:30,918
it down keeping it real I hope all of

649
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:34,159
your Gardens come out very well this

650
00:22:30,919 --> 00:22:36,960
season the question says Hey Rasta Jeff

651
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:40,240
is it wise to do a few pheno hunts of

652
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:42,319
different crosses all in the same room

653
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,919
um so I'm assuming you've got uh

654
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:46,119
multiple packs of seeds and you want to

655
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:48,120
run multiple packs and see if you can

656
00:22:46,119 --> 00:22:50,678
find a good pheno out of all of those

657
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:51,959
packs or maybe a population of each pack

658
00:22:50,679 --> 00:22:53,200
maybe three of this one three of this

659
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:55,759
one three of this one I understand what

660
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:58,880
you're doing I think here uh Is it wise

661
00:22:55,759 --> 00:23:00,919
do I advise this yes I absolutely do um

662
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:03,000
that way you get to see how all those

663
00:23:00,919 --> 00:23:05,759
different plants react to that room not

664
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,440
only do you get to see how plant a

665
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:09,558
reacts to that room but you could see if

666
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,519
maybe plant B acts differently in the

667
00:23:09,558 --> 00:23:13,879
room if plant C reacts differently in

668
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:16,359
the room that will help you find not

669
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:18,120
only the phenotype that you are hoping

670
00:23:16,359 --> 00:23:20,119
to find to smoke and consume but the one

671
00:23:18,119 --> 00:23:22,239
that works the best in your grow

672
00:23:20,119 --> 00:23:23,879
environment perhaps one of these strains

673
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,240
we're just going to go very basic one's

674
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:27,919
an Indo one's a sativa one's a [ __ ]

675
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,960
hybrid maybe you'll find that one of

676
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:32,240
those works way better in that grow

677
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:34,600
environment so not only are you pheno

678
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,720
hunting for the plants that you wish to

679
00:23:34,599 --> 00:23:39,399
consume and smoke but also you are pheno

680
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:41,200
hunting to see which plants work best in

681
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:43,159
that environment there are pros and cons

682
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,120
to running a monocrop which means just

683
00:23:43,159 --> 00:23:47,120
putting one pack of seeds in the room

684
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:48,918
and doing a pheno hunt from that whole

685
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:51,319
pack there but I do like seeing the

686
00:23:48,919 --> 00:23:52,880
diversity of the different packs of

687
00:23:51,319 --> 00:23:55,000
seeds in this room that will show you a

688
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,840
lot of different things and like I said

689
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,119
before now you're not just picking that

690
00:23:56,839 --> 00:23:59,678
one plant that works you're going to

691
00:23:58,119 --> 00:24:01,558
find a a lot of different options you

692
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:04,240
may find that one gem that works the

693
00:24:01,558 --> 00:24:06,440
best in that room uh don't fall in love

694
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,759
with any plants uh before you've smoked

695
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:10,240
everything don't fall in love with

696
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:11,879
anything too early uh give every plant

697
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,079
in there an equal chance because some of

698
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:16,440
those ugly plants some of those slower

699
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:18,599
plants uh those often times turn out to

700
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:20,400
be the Beauties so give everybody a fair

701
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:22,839
chance in this run see what grows the

702
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:25,440
best smokes the best and Suits the needs

703
00:24:22,839 --> 00:24:27,439
are you growing for a um a personal

704
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,200
consumption reason is it medical or

705
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,240
recreational are you growing for

706
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:34,600
somebody else's medical needs or are you

707
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:36,919
growing simply uh for a profit um find

708
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:39,038
the one that fits your uh your needs

709
00:24:36,919 --> 00:24:40,320
fits your Niche fills your demands

710
00:24:39,038 --> 00:24:42,919
that's the phenotype which you are

711
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:44,359
looking for um so now briefly let me

712
00:24:42,919 --> 00:24:46,278
jump into what I kind of just brought my

713
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:48,678
mind to there are pros and cons to

714
00:24:46,278 --> 00:24:50,519
running multiple packs of seeds um if

715
00:24:48,679 --> 00:24:52,480
you're just running that one pack of

716
00:24:50,519 --> 00:24:54,599
seeds you get a larger population you

717
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,798
may find uh you're going to find

718
00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:57,519
different phenotypes you're going to

719
00:24:55,798 --> 00:25:00,038
find it's like opening up more baseball

720
00:24:57,519 --> 00:25:02,558
cards you got that more of a chance of

721
00:25:00,038 --> 00:25:04,359
finding that uh that rookie card of the

722
00:25:02,558 --> 00:25:05,918
popular player for today I have no idea

723
00:25:04,359 --> 00:25:07,479
who the [ __ ] plays baseball today you

724
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:09,000
guys but it's like finding that Mickey

725
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:11,038
manual baseball card there the more

726
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,319
cards you open the more chances you have

727
00:25:11,038 --> 00:25:15,278
for that Mickey if you're running 10

728
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:17,000
seeds of something you got a one in 10

729
00:25:15,278 --> 00:25:19,200
chance of finding that super gem you're

730
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,798
looking for if you run a 100 seeds you

731
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,480
got that one in 100 if you only run

732
00:25:20,798 --> 00:25:24,480
three seeds of something you're

733
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,960
diminishing your chances of finding that

734
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:29,079
phenotype however then then my brain

735
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:31,120
does this also does this AR argument how

736
00:25:29,079 --> 00:25:33,079
many seeds do you need to run out of a

737
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:34,918
pack of seeds to find a keeper and my

738
00:25:33,079 --> 00:25:36,879
fem seeds there's six of them if you run

739
00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:38,240
three to six I really think you'll find

740
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,760
a keeper so I think your numbers are

741
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,319
going to be okay if you do at least

742
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:44,278
three of each thing in this fenal hunt

743
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:46,278
all right I'm rambling at this point um

744
00:25:44,278 --> 00:25:48,440
there are pros and cons to this um like

745
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:49,839
I said before if you run a whole pack of

746
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:52,840
something and fill the tent with one

747
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:54,879
thing you got a much more uh a much more

748
00:25:52,839 --> 00:25:56,959
a broader view of what those genetics

749
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:59,278
have to offer you may find something uh

750
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:01,558
more special in there but if you want to

751
00:25:59,278 --> 00:26:03,319
fenal hunt multiple things uh you will

752
00:26:01,558 --> 00:26:05,759
see what your nutrients are doing your

753
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:07,639
environment is doing what your skills

754
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:09,558
and work are doing to multiple different

755
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:11,120
plants you may learn things that way

756
00:26:09,558 --> 00:26:12,879
you'll see that some things do work like

757
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:14,678
we said before Indica sativa hybrid

758
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,200
you'll see that some things work well

759
00:26:14,679 --> 00:26:17,840
for this plant that don't work on this

760
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,519
plant and this plant tolerates some [ __ ]

761
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:22,079
that these don't this one really likes

762
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:24,200
something you'll see the diversity in

763
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:26,199
that population and how they all respond

764
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:27,840
to different treatment all right my dude

765
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:29,880
you really got me rambling on this one

766
