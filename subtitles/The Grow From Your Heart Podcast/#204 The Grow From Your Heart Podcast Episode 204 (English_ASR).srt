32
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:34,129
videos of this podcast making a video as

33
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:35,930
a big pain in the ass and it really

34
00:01:34,129 --> 00:01:38,149
detracts from the quality of the show in

35
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:40,368
my opinion I was too distracted by toys

36
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:43,160
and equipment I wasn't able to make a

37
00:01:40,368 --> 00:01:45,140
good podcast so I've decided to not make

38
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:47,569
videos of the show what I will do is

39
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:50,239
keep making cheesy ass YouTube videos

40
00:01:47,569 --> 00:01:51,679
with iMovie and just put up videos that

41
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:53,239
are mostly still shot so it'll be some

42
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,610
video in there but it mostly be stills

43
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:57,530

47
00:02:01,609 --> 00:02:06,019

gallery it's a little smaller than I

64
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:45,358
expected but boy do I approve came with

00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:48,000
this super-awesome chain saw dabber here

66
00:02:45,359 --> 00:02:49,739
I think this little handle here they're

67
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,049
encouraging me to wear this is a pendant

68
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:53,549
as what I think's happening and this rig

69
00:02:52,049 --> 00:02:56,430
is certainly designed to be worn as a

70
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:57,659
pendant this thing I think Adam said

71
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:59,790
what is that three inches tall

72
00:02:57,658 --> 00:03:01,229

73
00:02:59,789 --> 00:03:03,688

00:14:57,919 --> 00:15:02,689
medical cannabis or cannabis in Alaska

350
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:07,039
and this lady was reporting on it and

351
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:09,800
then during her report she states that

352
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:12,139
she supports cannabis and that she

353
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:14,419
actually is the owner of the Alaska

354
00:15:12,139 --> 00:15:16,250
cannabis club so this is kind of where

355

364
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:52,549
like she pissed her pants when she said

365
00:15:50,659 --> 00:15:56,059

366

369
00:15:59,809 --> 00:16:03,769

370
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:05,899

374
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:13,850
relaying the news

375
00:16:11,259 --> 00:16:17,330
then I read who it's by I don't know if

376
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:19,340
I said who it's by it's by Molly Riley

377
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:22,550
from The Huffington Post I think I'm

378
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:24,560
gonna give me a dirty nasty recycled jar

379
00:16:22,549 --> 00:16:27,079
to bring over here and set on your table

380
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:29,089
during these podcast just for ya just so

381
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:30,590
you feel dirty even dirty had to put it

382
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:36,320
like you have to stick it to the bottom

383
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:38,030
of the jar all right so it says a local

384
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,620
news the local news anchor who

385
00:16:38,029 --> 00:16:41,059
dramatically quit her job on-air

386
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:42,740
following a segment on marijuana

387
00:16:41,059 --> 00:16:43,819
explained her exit and a YouTube video

388
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:47,000
released Monday

389
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:49,190
Charlo Greene a reporter for Anchorage's

390
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,080
Katie VA announced on air that she would

391
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:53,060
be leaving her job at the TV station to

392
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:56,300
focus on marijuana legalization in

393
00:16:53,059 --> 00:16:58,189
Alaska so like I said they ran the clip

394
00:16:56,299 --> 00:16:59,929
about cannabis and then she says this

395
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:02,030
everything you've heard is why I the

396
00:16:59,929 --> 00:17:03,769
actual owner of the Alaska cannabis club

397
00:17:02,029 --> 00:17:05,480
will be dedicating all of my energy to

398
00:17:03,769 --> 00:17:07,370
fighting for freedom and fairness which

399
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:10,009
begins with legalizing marijuana here in

400
00:17:07,369 --> 00:17:12,078
Alaska she said and as for this job

401
00:17:10,009 --> 00:17:14,509
well not that I have a choice but [ __ ]

402
00:17:12,078 --> 00:17:18,740
it I quit so that's where she stirred up

403
00:17:14,509 --> 00:17:23,269
a lot of controversy she in my opinion

404
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:26,449
the attention should have been on her

405
00:17:23,269 --> 00:17:28,970
advocacy her support and her fight to

406
00:17:26,449 --> 00:17:31,850
legalize in support of cannabis instead

407
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:34,370
she chose one wrong word on the air on

408
00:17:31,849 --> 00:17:36,259
TV now and distracted it from all of

409
00:17:34,369 --> 00:17:38,239
what she was trying to do she said the

410
00:17:36,259 --> 00:17:40,970
word that cost me a dollar on the air on

411
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,769
TV so that I hadn't pointed it out that

412
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:44,870
that TV stations gonna face a fine

413
00:17:42,769 --> 00:17:46,668
absolutely the FCC's gonna do something

414
00:17:44,869 --> 00:17:52,250
even if it was early morning and there

415
00:17:46,669 --> 00:18:01,549
was very small numbers yeah goes from

416
00:17:52,250 --> 00:18:04,429
like 2500 to like can they find her and

417
00:18:01,548 --> 00:18:05,990
her choice of words distracted from her

418
00:18:04,429 --> 00:18:09,200
whole fight and made her kind of look

419
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:10,759
bad she could acquit on air and probably

420
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,519
send a better message but it wouldn't

421
00:18:10,759 --> 00:18:21,859
have been heard it wouldn't have been

422
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:24,379
heard so broadly on my facebook it was

423
00:18:21,859 --> 00:18:27,138
all anybody had posted all day so

424
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:29,649
apparently she she got herself popular

425
00:18:27,138 --> 00:18:34,428
the way she was trying to do but I

426
00:18:29,648 --> 00:18:35,839
there's also the you know I'm not saying

427
00:18:34,429 --> 00:18:38,600
that the marijuana business is gonna

428
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:40,250
fail but maybe she hits a snafu and it

429
00:18:38,599 --> 00:18:42,168
kind of crumbles from underneath her

430
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:45,138
maybe she trusts the wrong partner or

431
00:18:42,169 --> 00:18:46,820
there's some kind of illegal there's all

432
00:18:45,138 --> 00:18:48,798
kinds of things that could happen and

433
00:18:46,819 --> 00:18:50,839
from here on out she's never getting a

434
00:18:48,798 --> 00:18:52,429
reporting job again oh no you know

435
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:54,918
you're never getting on any kind of

436
00:18:52,429 --> 00:18:57,048
cable access let alone you know making a

437
00:18:54,919 --> 00:18:58,580
comedy show you know maybe that she can

438
00:18:57,048 --> 00:19:00,619
come on our podcast whenever she'd like

439
00:18:58,579 --> 00:19:02,298
oh there you go there's the invitation

440
00:19:00,619 --> 00:19:04,189
yeah all right I'll keep going with the

441
00:19:02,298 --> 00:19:05,869
article in the YouTube clip Green

442
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:07,639
explained why she believes the fight for

443
00:19:05,869 --> 00:19:08,819
marijuana legalization in her home state

444
00:19:07,638 --> 00:19:11,099
is so important

445
00:19:08,819 --> 00:19:12,898
there comes a time in each and every one

446
00:19:11,099 --> 00:19:14,849
of our lives or we must choose to

447
00:19:12,898 --> 00:19:16,589
continue to spectate or stand up for

448
00:19:14,849 --> 00:19:19,349
what's right she said why are Americans

449
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:22,589
arrested every 30 seconds alaskans every

450
00:19:19,349 --> 00:19:23,969
4.3 hours why shouldn't aspiring someone

451
00:19:22,589 --> 00:19:25,859
lose their ability to earn a higher

452
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:27,929
education to become someone they were

453
00:19:25,859 --> 00:19:29,908
not meant to be and why should you lose

454
00:19:27,929 --> 00:19:33,509
the ability to get public assistance in

455
00:19:29,909 --> 00:19:35,278
times of struggle and need she continued

456
00:19:33,509 --> 00:19:36,870
advocating for freedom and fairness

457
00:19:35,278 --> 00:19:38,819
should be everybody's duty

458
00:19:36,869 --> 00:19:40,949
I'm making it my life work to uphold

459
00:19:38,819 --> 00:19:42,710
what America stands for truly life

460
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:49,379
liberty and the pursuit of happiness

461
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:51,990
ideals now need to be defended I agree

462
00:19:49,378 --> 00:19:54,719
with her but as I've been told numerous

463
00:19:51,990 --> 00:20:00,120
times throughout my life it's not what

464
00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:01,769
you do it's how you do it and as hearing

465
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:03,928
it over and over again is you shouldn't

466
00:20:01,769 --> 00:20:06,179
have said if you shouldna said [ __ ] you

467
00:20:03,929 --> 00:20:12,298
shoulda said this you know I hear it

468
00:20:06,179 --> 00:20:14,788
constantly but if that's the type that

469
00:20:12,298 --> 00:20:16,378
you know I'm not the type of person to

470
00:20:14,788 --> 00:20:17,819
bite my tongue especially if you cross

471
00:20:16,378 --> 00:20:21,658
me and I felt like I haven't done

472
00:20:17,819 --> 00:20:27,569
anything wrong so if they were gonna

473
00:20:21,659 --> 00:20:30,629
fire her they were gonna fire her until

474
00:20:27,569 --> 00:20:32,579
she said that she owned why she was

475
00:20:30,628 --> 00:20:34,378
legit anyway she's got a backup job so

476
00:20:32,579 --> 00:20:36,210
she could have just said and I since

477
00:20:34,378 --> 00:20:39,990
that's probably my last report so it's

478
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:45,690
nice seeing you guys instead of I quit

479
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:47,308
yeah the opportunity to go on the news

480
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:49,139
in front of camera would you rather say

481
00:20:47,308 --> 00:20:50,638
and tonight I respectfully design or

482
00:20:49,138 --> 00:21:04,229
would you rather be like you suck you

483
00:20:50,638 --> 00:21:06,178
suck [ __ ] it I quit yeah alright so the

484
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:08,038
last line of the article says Alaskans

485
00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:09,750
are set to vote on ballot measure 2

486
00:21:08,038 --> 00:21:11,009
which would legalize possession of small

487
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:14,128
amounts of marijuana for recreational

488
00:21:11,009 --> 00:21:16,710
use in November Colorado and Washington

489
00:21:14,128 --> 00:21:19,038
have implemented similar legislation in

490
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:21,720
the last year

491
00:21:19,038 --> 00:21:23,429
they made it against the law to like

492
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:29,899
drink in separate counties that was

493
00:21:23,429 --> 00:21:32,399
ballot initiative one I'm guessing a

494
00:21:29,898 --> 00:21:34,728
minute ago when it was like every 30

495
00:21:32,398 --> 00:21:38,819
seconds an American is rested in put in

496
00:21:34,729 --> 00:21:46,519
for pot and every 4.3 minutes in four

497
00:21:38,819 --> 00:21:50,358
point three hours in Alaska like get out

498
00:21:46,519 --> 00:21:50,358
they're all after the Moose knuckles

499
00:21:50,829 --> 00:21:55,499
[Music]

500
00:21:52,548 --> 00:21:57,028
legalize possession of small amounts of

501
00:21:55,499 --> 00:21:58,489
marijuana for recreational use in

502
00:21:57,028 --> 00:22:01,470
November that would be freakin awesome

503
00:21:58,489 --> 00:22:05,399

513
00:22:19,888 --> 00:22:23,368
herself by using the language she did or

514
00:22:21,749 --> 00:22:24,868
did she actually help herself out by

515
00:22:23,368 --> 00:22:27,089
using that language it's what I want to

516

517

border of I'm down with saying [ __ ] it

518
00:22:29,429 --> 00:22:34,590
quit but in all my friends who have

519
00:22:31,888 --> 00:22:38,219
respectable businesses and respectable

520
00:22:34,589 --> 00:22:40,199
things would be like no you really

521
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:41,788
should and that's usually afterwards you

522
00:22:40,200 --> 00:23:02,399
know it's usually at this point in time

523
00:22:41,788 --> 00:23:12,778
where we're talking now so you're just

524
00:23:02,398 --> 00:23:14,878
about to put once I warn you you're

525
00:23:12,778 --> 00:23:18,598
pretty on it I have been guilty to fail

526
00:23:14,878 --> 00:23:20,278
you know you got to learn how many if

527
00:23:18,598 --> 00:23:21,868
you try stuff and you do it perfectly

528
00:23:20,278 --> 00:23:23,460
you're like I'm [ __ ] good at that you

529
00:23:21,868 --> 00:23:25,168
have a dollar for that one but if you do

530
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:26,909
something you fail you're like boy I'm

531
00:23:25,169 --> 00:23:28,470
humbled I really feel like I'll learn

532
00:23:26,909 --> 00:23:30,000
how to do this right

533
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:33,180
yeah you don't learn anything the first

534
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:36,259
time you get stuff right so where'd that

535
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:38,519
article go where is it here it is

536
00:23:36,259 --> 00:23:41,029
Adam actually brought this article to my

537
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:44,220
attention it's written by Jeremy P Meyer

538
00:23:41,029 --> 00:23:47,129
we found this on the Denver Post calm

539
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:51,170
it says Colorado school's out millions

540
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:55,230
due to marijuana excise tax loophole

541
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:56,670
well it's not they're not out this

542
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:58,019
sounds like they had millions in their

543
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:59,190
pockets and somebody reached in and took

544
00:23:58,019 --> 00:24:01,349
it out that's not the way this went

545
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:03,299
that's the way I read it yeah I read

546
00:24:01,349 --> 00:24:04,740
this article it's a little misleading

547
00:24:03,299 --> 00:24:06,809
but they have to do that with headlines

548
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:08,400
to get you to read it the schools did

549
00:24:06,809 --> 00:24:10,769
get kind of punked a little bit but it

550
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,900
wasn't a loophole it was a business move

551
00:24:10,769 --> 00:24:14,730
and it wasn't aimed nobody was like

552
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:16,290
let's screw the schools nobody did that

553
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:17,610
it was just what business people were

554
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:20,059
doing because it's how business was

555
00:24:17,609 --> 00:24:22,889
being done at the time the law was wrote

556
00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:24,509
yeah so it says a loophole built into

557
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:26,580
Colorado's marijuana system has allowed

558
00:24:24,509 --> 00:24:28,170
thousands of pounds of pot to go untaxed

559
00:24:26,579 --> 00:24:29,339
and has cost the state millions of

560
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:32,550
dollars that should have gone to school

561
00:24:29,339 --> 00:24:34,619
construction fund in 2012 Colorado

562
00:24:32,549 --> 00:24:36,960
voters overwhelmingly approved amendment

563
00:24:34,619 --> 00:24:39,119
64 which among other things promised

564
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,920
that the first forty million dollars in

565
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:42,659
excise tax revenue would be dedicated

566
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:44,789
every year for the state school

567
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:46,710
construction fund but this year only

568
00:24:44,789 --> 00:24:48,269
about ten million dollars is expected to

569
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:50,940
be raised thanks to a rule that allows

570
00:24:48,269 --> 00:24:53,490
marijuana retailers to avoid paying the

571
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:57,660
tax in a one-time transfer of wholesale

572
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:59,549
pot sure sorry I declare my myface there

573
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:01,410
surely revenue will increase over time

574
00:24:59,549 --> 00:25:03,269
as the industry continues to mature and

575
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:06,090
fewer license holders are able to use

576
00:25:03,269 --> 00:25:07,799
the one-time tax free transfer so what

577
00:25:06,089 --> 00:25:08,849
they're able to do I don't haven't read

578
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:10,529
far enough into the article here but

579
00:25:08,849 --> 00:25:13,049
what they're able to do shops that have

580
00:25:10,529 --> 00:25:15,119
medical marijuana are able to move it

581
00:25:13,049 --> 00:25:16,829
from their medical marijuana side to the

582
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:18,569
recreational marijuana side to make it

583
00:25:16,829 --> 00:25:21,509
available for everybody instead of just

584
00:25:18,569 --> 00:25:24,299
medical patients but there must be a tax

585
00:25:21,509 --> 00:25:26,730
paid when that happens because the taxes

586
00:25:24,299 --> 00:25:29,849
are different on the medical side and

587
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:31,650
the REC side and Colorado tried to

588
00:25:29,849 --> 00:25:33,209
protect the medical side a little bit by

589
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:37,110
doing this but in my opinion it has

590
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:39,509
failed so I'll continue into the article

591
00:25:37,109 --> 00:25:41,609
whether the excise tax revenue will ever

592
00:25:39,509 --> 00:25:43,230
reach 40 million is anyone's guess

593
00:25:41,609 --> 00:25:46,259
Bishan is the amount will never be

594
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:49,140
attained as and was a pie in the sky

595
00:25:46,259 --> 00:25:51,150
figure meant to attract voters if that

596
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:53,700
sounds familiar you may be remembering

597
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:54,960
the 2008 campaign for a man with 50 that

598
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:57,179
promised a hundred and eighty-two

599
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,429
million over five years to Community

600
00:25:57,179 --> 00:26:01,259
College's from the expansion of gaming

601
00:25:59,429 --> 00:26:02,759
however only twenty five point three

602
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:06,779
million has been generated through the

603
00:26:02,759 --> 00:26:10,079
fiscal year 2012 to 2013 after people

604
00:26:06,779 --> 00:26:12,750
are spending their money on marijuana

605
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:15,389
tax revenues would certainly grow if the

606
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:17,220
loophole that was created by regulators

607
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:19,799
to watch the industry was closed there

608
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:21,360
are still 275 license holders who could

609
00:26:19,798 --> 00:26:25,440
take advantage of it according to one

610
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:27,808
source the loophole was created to make

611
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,640
sure enough pop would be in the retail

612
00:26:27,808 --> 00:26:31,759
marketplace when doors opened on January

613
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:33,870
1st 2014

614
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:36,298
regulators allowed medical marijuana

615
00:26:33,869 --> 00:26:40,409
licensees converting to retail a

616
00:26:36,298 --> 00:26:42,089
one-time tax free transfer that transfer

617
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:43,860
was a big difference between Colorado

618
00:26:42,089 --> 00:26:46,480
and Washington the other state that

619
00:26:43,859 --> 00:26:49,779
legalized retail marijuana

620
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:51,160
and why the sorry I had to reread that

621
00:26:49,779 --> 00:26:53,049
census it looked weird to me something

622
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:54,610
didn't sound right but okay that

623
00:26:53,049 --> 00:26:56,889
transfer was a big difference between

624
00:26:54,609 --> 00:26:58,209
Colorado was the big difference is what

625
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:59,290
it should say between Colorado and

626
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:01,360
Washington the other state that

627
00:26:59,289 --> 00:27:02,799
legalized retail marijuana okay and why

628
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:03,519
the Centennial state was out the door

629
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:05,529
first

630
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:08,589
Washington had to grow its retail crop

631
00:27:05,529 --> 00:27:10,750
from seed Colorado officials say nine

632
00:27:08,589 --> 00:27:14,349
thousand seven hundred and eleven pounds

633
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:17,470
of medical paw was transferred tax-free

634
00:27:14,349 --> 00:27:19,000
to recent retail stores four thousand

635
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:20,799
seven hundred and twenty four pounds of

636
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,470
medical marijuana was moved to retail

637
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:25,899
marijuana products and manufacturers an

638
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:27,309
eight thousand five hundred and seventy

639
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:28,810
six pounds of medical pot was

640
00:27:27,309 --> 00:27:32,139
transferred to retail marijuana

641
00:27:28,809 --> 00:27:34,569
cultivation facilities that last tranche

642
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:36,550
will be subject to the tax

643
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:40,000
once it is transferred or sold to

644
00:27:36,549 --> 00:27:41,740
another marijuana establishment there

645
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,920
will be taxes made on this just not that

646
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:46,569
original transfer tax so it says it is

647
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:48,370
estimated the untaxed pot would have

648
00:27:46,569 --> 00:27:50,139
provided three million dollars for the

649
00:27:48,369 --> 00:27:51,669
state school construction fund or twice

650
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:53,950
what the fund received in the fiscal

651
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:55,269
year Cathie girp are a member of the

652
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:59,980

for schools construction and renovation

656
00:28:04,269 --> 00:28:08,680
knew the numbers were going to be low

657
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:10,270
after seeing February's receipts the

658
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:12,160
first month we were thinking we're going

659
00:28:10,269 --> 00:28:13,539
to be rolling in cash she said then the

660
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,769
second month it was wait a minute we're

661
00:28:13,539 --> 00:28:16,740
only getting fractions of what we

662
00:28:14,769 --> 00:28:20,289
thought were we were going to get in

663
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:22,509
this this was not the voter intent she

664
00:28:20,289 --> 00:28:22,990
said I don't think anyone who voted for

665
00:28:22,509 --> 00:28:24,609
a minute

666
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:27,970
sixty four thought this would happen she

667
00:28:24,609 --> 00:28:29,500
said they thought the money would go to

668
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:32,230
school kids this is coming at the

669
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:35,890
expense of kids in really needy school

670
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:37,930
districts sorry there's the Texas broken

671
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:40,210
up oddly with ads here sorry the

672
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:41,950

674
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:45,400
helps districts the districts with

675
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:46,870
capital construction it is able to

676
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:48,280
support projects in rural school

677
00:28:46,869 --> 00:28:51,069
districts that don't have large property

678
00:28:48,279 --> 00:28:52,690
bases necessary for bond projects the

679
00:28:51,069 --> 00:28:54,189
best fund over the years has received

680
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:56,289
more than three hundred and eighty five

681
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:58,830
million dollars in revenue ninety

682
00:28:56,289 --> 00:29:00,750
percent from the state land trust

683
00:28:58,829 --> 00:29:03,148
this year the best fund is helping

684
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:05,130
construction buildings in the Edson 54

685
00:29:03,148 --> 00:29:06,719
JT School District and supporting

686
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:08,340
projects and dozens of school districts

687
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:11,519
around the state for things like roof

688
00:29:08,339 --> 00:29:13,199
replacements and boilers marijuana taxes

689
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:16,319
were providing less than 1% of the

690
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:18,210
program's funds or 3.1 million dollars

691
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:20,308
it would have made a big difference she

692
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:22,470
said whether there is a tax credit on

693
00:29:20,308 --> 00:29:25,490
the other side there is somebody to whom

694
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:27,778
the tax credit should have gone okay

695
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:31,138
proposition double-a which was approved

696
00:29:27,778 --> 00:29:34,230
by voters in 2013 mandates a 15% excise

697
00:29:31,138 --> 00:29:37,589
tax on imposed imposed on unprocessed

698
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:39,538
retail marijuana but amendment 64 says

699
00:29:37,589 --> 00:29:41,339
no excise taxes can be charged on pot

700
00:29:39,538 --> 00:29:43,919
cultivated as medical marijuana a

701
00:29:41,339 --> 00:29:46,019
transfer illogically of medically drom

702
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:47,759
pot couldn't be taxed which is the basis

703
00:29:46,019 --> 00:29:50,519
for the loophole the simple solution

704
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:52,259
then is to discontinue transfers the

705
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:53,880
state doesn't need them anyway the

706
00:29:52,259 --> 00:29:55,500
retail pot industry is up and running

707
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:57,440
now and doesn't need the influx of

708
00:29:55,500 --> 00:30:01,138
medical pot to prop up retail stores

709
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:02,788
plus transfers disadvantage retail

710
00:30:01,138 --> 00:30:04,528
growers who have to pay the tax when

711
00:30:02,788 --> 00:30:07,679
medical growers don't for that one-time

712
00:30:04,528 --> 00:30:09,538
swap it was never our intent to

713
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:12,690
manipulate the market said rep dan pay

714
00:30:09,538 --> 00:30:15,000
bond it's correct it's a correction that

715
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:16,889
needs to be made he said also a draft

716
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:20,730
bill already had been written that would

717
00:30:16,888 --> 00:30:22,558
stop the transfer after January 1st 2016

718
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:24,720
but the loophole should be closed sooner

719
00:30:22,558 --> 00:30:26,970
to match the voters intent and make good

720
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:31,798
on a promise that the revenue should be

721
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:34,769
going to schools I agree and the revenue

722
00:30:31,798 --> 00:30:39,720
should go to the schools but where's the

723
00:30:34,769 --> 00:30:45,120
other money going like if why did he get

724
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:47,819
exempt from the schools if I understand

725
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:49,768
40 million 40 million sounds a lot just

726
00:30:47,819 --> 00:30:52,220
that money they said would make 40

727
00:30:49,769 --> 00:30:57,660
million in like the first

728
00:30:52,220 --> 00:31:00,539
it's 48 hours maybe in total sales maybe

729
00:30:57,660 --> 00:31:02,580
but what they're saying is uh this tax

730
00:31:00,539 --> 00:31:04,319
that they had this tax set up this tax

731
00:31:02,579 --> 00:31:05,939
was supposed to go here and the money

732
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:11,099
didn't happen because these guys found a

733
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:13,980
way to not make the money it was one

734
00:31:11,099 --> 00:31:15,990
point nine point nine million dollars of

735
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:18,480
taxable money from this County alone

736
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:21,299
right all that was to go to different

737
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:22,680
places this one is the one that didn't

738
00:31:21,299 --> 00:31:27,629
happen because they said this money

739
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:30,330
right here specifically was like cut the

740
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:31,680
kid down you know like in the council

741
00:31:30,329 --> 00:31:33,029
was like I got a good idea that's what

742
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:34,320
I'm saying they didn't that's it wasn't

743
00:31:33,029 --> 00:31:36,359
even aim to do that it's just kind of

744
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:39,059
this rule is set up to help them have

745
00:31:36,359 --> 00:31:40,649
enough herb for when the shops open but

746
00:31:39,059 --> 00:31:42,210
that was also they said when this

747
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:44,550
money's made it's going to the schools

748
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:46,200
but they just didn't get made nobody was

749
00:31:44,549 --> 00:31:48,899
really like [ __ ] that fund [ __ ] those

750
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:50,160
kids that's two dollars nobody was

751
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:52,110
really like that it's just that's just

752
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,980
how it worked out that there's a way

753
00:31:52,109 --> 00:31:55,829
around that

754
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:57,269
like if I told you it would be nice if

755
00:31:55,829 --> 00:32:00,779
they were like all right this is we we

756
00:31:57,269 --> 00:32:03,809
thought we were expecting you know maybe

757
00:32:00,779 --> 00:32:07,549
a hundred million dollars for the first

758
00:32:03,809 --> 00:32:07,549
year and they just said you know what

759
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:22,140
but why not you know drop that common

760
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:24,299
course [ __ ] and get on with your lives

761
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:29,820
tell the rest of the country that you

762
00:32:24,299 --> 00:32:30,419
were the high ones yeah we're not gonna

763
00:32:29,819 --> 00:32:33,210
do that

764
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:36,330
I kind of agree that they should change

765
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:37,529
the rule by 2016 they're right if the

766
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:40,470
shops are doing it right they don't need

767
00:32:37,529 --> 00:32:42,029
to move herb around and if you draw a

768
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:44,819
medical herb it needs to be there for

769
00:32:42,029 --> 00:32:46,920
the patients mmm yeah so they didn't

770
00:32:44,819 --> 00:32:49,409
really purposely screw the kids out

771
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:51,330
that's just how like if I told you if

772
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:52,650
you drive around the block every day on

773
00:32:51,329 --> 00:32:54,210
your work you don't have to pay the $3

774
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:56,100
toll fee mm-hmm but that three dollar

775
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:57,809
total fee goes to the skit to the school

776
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:59,189
kids still drive her on the Block he

777
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:00,839
wouldn't give a [ __ ] about three dollars

778
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:02,400
that's what they did they just drove

779
00:33:00,839 --> 00:33:03,750
around the block they didn't really they

780
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,960
didn't go take the three bucks and stab

781
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:07,148
somebody for it and

782
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:10,419
just skip painted this speaking of this

783
00:33:07,148 --> 00:33:13,808
whole taking medical and taking it

784
00:33:10,419 --> 00:33:16,240
recreational I went out to the shop the

785
00:33:13,808 --> 00:33:20,048
other day I won't say which one but it

786
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:23,440
was further special there was nothing on

787
00:33:20,048 --> 00:33:24,940
the medical side zero and they're like

788
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:27,640
well you can choose from the

789
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:31,840
recreational there's literally four

790
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:33,700
kinds and it was all sativa heavy

791
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:35,230
seventy percent you know who knows what

792
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:37,000
they're talking fracture I know it shop

793
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:40,599
you went to and they've recently opened

794
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,859
up another location north of here and I

795
00:33:40,599 --> 00:33:43,629
have a friend who stopped there just the

796
00:33:41,859 --> 00:33:45,129
other day and they were hopping and the

797
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:46,630
place was full and had all kinds of

798
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:48,340
great [ __ ] so what they've done is

799
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:51,399
they've taken all their product they go

800
00:33:48,339 --> 00:33:56,589
west location no it's full like oh oh

801
00:33:51,398 --> 00:33:59,168
maybe there but they did a whole shelf

802
00:33:56,589 --> 00:34:09,909
of shatter a whole bunch of new extracts

803
00:33:59,169 --> 00:34:11,289
and things like that you know yeah the

804
00:34:09,909 --> 00:34:14,289
shops need to get it together in my

805
00:34:11,289 --> 00:34:16,119
opinion for sure I'm just saying that

806
00:34:14,289 --> 00:34:18,009
affected us you know that affected us

807
00:34:16,119 --> 00:34:21,129
here locally that affected me local

808
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:22,990
patients yeah that's so why that really

809
00:34:21,128 --> 00:34:26,710
sucks is because as a medical on the

810
00:34:22,989 --> 00:34:31,209
medical side the herb is cheaper to just

811
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:35,050
to start it's considered medicine it's

812
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:37,329
it's not even you know I I'm not gonna

813
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:46,179
lie about I have it for not strangling

814
00:34:37,329 --> 00:34:48,219
my wife a little side they charge you

815
00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:51,639
more then on the recreational side dad

816
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:53,529
attacks to it so let's just move the

817
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:54,820
same product from the recreational sir

818
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:56,950
from the medical side right over to the

819
00:34:54,820 --> 00:35:02,710
recreational side mark it up ten bucks

820
00:34:56,949 --> 00:35:05,439
an eighth more half let's half the price

821
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:07,750
it's so so yeah just mark it up way high

822
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,980
charge an extra tax for it and then

823
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:09,670
don't even care about the medical

824
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:11,380
patients anymore

825
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:12,849

826
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:14,740
business owner do that and look his

827
00:35:12,849 --> 00:35:18,130
patients his customers whoa

828
00:35:14,739 --> 00:35:19,779
they give you priority over the wreck

829
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:22,090
patience that means the rec patience is

830
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:24,250

831
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:27,940
patients come in come in come in and

832
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:29,199
they do and they just sit there so if

833
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:30,849
you got that's the only thing you get

834
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:32,139
though right is that red card priority

835
00:35:30,849 --> 00:35:33,909

[Music]

881
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:11,880
all right so prosecutors object to war

882
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:14,309
on weed is the title of this article

883
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:27,510
looking for someone who wrote it where's

884
00:38:14,309 --> 00:38:29,429
the author on the road all right

885
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:31,890
prosecutors object to war on weed by

886
00:38:29,429 --> 00:38:34,169
Chris Wiggins I probably said that wrong

887
00:38:31,889 --> 00:38:35,670
but you know that's how I do stuff whoa

888
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:39,809
technical glitch there's sound like a

889
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:41,250
cutout for a second anyway all right the

890
00:38:39,809 --> 00:38:43,409
prosecution objects that's one way to

891
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:45,539
put it at any rate to news stories from

892
00:38:43,409 --> 00:38:47,549
the Pacific Northwest today pose an

893
00:38:45,539 --> 00:38:48,869
interesting question our prosecutors

894
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:50,880
beginning to get fed up with the war on

895
00:38:48,869 --> 00:38:53,100
weed the two stories are completely

896
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:55,108
unrelated I should mention one is about

897
00:38:53,099 --> 00:38:57,750
a current prosecutor at the local level

898
00:38:55,108 --> 00:38:59,190
and one is about a formal former federal

899
00:38:57,750 --> 00:39:01,440
prosecutor making a noteworthy

900
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:03,659
endorsement neither has anything to do

901
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:05,909
with the other but both show some common

902
00:39:03,659 --> 00:39:08,879
sense being applied in a refreshing ways

903
00:39:05,909 --> 00:39:10,799
it's too early to call it a trend even a

904
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,390
regional one regional one but it

905
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,030
certainly is a step in the right

906
00:39:12,389 --> 00:39:18,509
direction at the very least

907
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:22,170
so first the local story Seattle's

908
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:24,720
electric oh jeez Seattle's elected

909
00:39:22,170 --> 00:39:26,579
prosecutor said Monday he's dropping all

910
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:28,559
tickets issued for the public use of

911
00:39:26,579 --> 00:39:30,480
marijuana through the first seven months

912
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:33,059
of this year because most of them were

913
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:35,579
issued by a single officer who disagrees

914
00:39:33,059 --> 00:39:37,710
with the legal pot law in a briefing to

915
00:39:35,579 --> 00:39:40,079
City Council on Monday city attorney

916
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:41,818
Pete Holmes says he is moving to dismiss

917
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:43,978
approximately 100

918
00:39:41,818 --> 00:39:46,228
tickets issued by the Seattle Police

919
00:39:43,978 --> 00:39:49,139
Department between January 1st and July

920
00:39:46,228 --> 00:39:52,348
31st his office also said it would be

921
00:39:49,139 --> 00:39:56,308
seeking a refund for 22 people who have

922
00:39:52,349 --> 00:39:58,140
already paid their $27 ticket so one

923
00:39:56,309 --> 00:40:00,509
state to the south a former federal

924
00:39:58,139 --> 00:40:02,400
prosecutor for Oregon has thrown her

925
00:40:00,509 --> 00:40:04,498
support behind a ballot initiative to

926
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:06,660
legalize recreational marijuana for

927
00:40:04,498 --> 00:40:09,028
adults in the state Chris Olson who

928
00:40:06,659 --> 00:40:10,920
served as Oregon's chief federal

929
00:40:09,028 --> 00:40:12,929
prosecutor during the Clinton

930
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:15,719
administration made the news by joining

931
00:40:12,929 --> 00:40:18,208
House member Earl Blumenauer and a

932
00:40:15,719 --> 00:40:20,608
former Oregon Supreme Court justice by

933
00:40:18,208 --> 00:40:22,768
publicly publicly supporting the ballot

934
00:40:20,608 --> 00:40:24,449
measure and here's the story I enforce

935
00:40:22,768 --> 00:40:26,308
our marijuana laws but they don't work

936
00:40:24,449 --> 00:40:28,440
Olson said in a statement announcing her

937
00:40:26,309 --> 00:40:30,900
endorsement filling our courts and jails

938
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:32,969
has failed to reduce marijuana use and

939
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:35,190
drug cartels are pocketing all the

940
00:40:32,969 --> 00:40:38,068
profits she said citing federal federal

941
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:40,289
statistics that show about 1 in 14

942
00:40:38,068 --> 00:40:45,538
Oregon arrests is for marijuana

943
00:40:40,289 --> 00:40:47,459
possession you know we're not the

944
00:40:45,539 --> 00:40:49,589
government here in Colorado is not

945
00:40:47,458 --> 00:40:51,929
bitching about the cartel really any

946
00:40:49,588 --> 00:40:55,108
much anymore running pot now they're

947
00:40:51,929 --> 00:40:57,568
starting to look at like you guys you

948
00:40:55,108 --> 00:40:59,190

949
00:40:57,568 --> 00:41:03,358
care of patients they're like hold on

950
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:06,449
they're not just we don't have control

951
00:41:03,358 --> 00:41:08,489
over everything so we need that and and

952
00:41:06,449 --> 00:41:10,289
that's what it's become it's not even a

953
00:41:08,489 --> 00:41:13,170
crime anymore so now they're starting to

954
00:41:10,289 --> 00:41:14,969
turn into oh we're making tons of money

955
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:16,469
but how can we get just a little more

956

964
00:41:33,239 --> 00:41:37,769
Mexican brick weed for $25 1/2 ounce and

965
00:41:36,958 --> 00:41:40,108

they only smoked a bowl of day 2 balls a

967
00:41:40,108 --> 00:41:42,958

968
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:45,539
them you know - it's and they'd just be

969

and this is my interjection here I'm not

979
00:42:04,769 --> 00:42:08,670
into the article right now the first

980
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:10,289
story here is about a prosecutor saying

981
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:13,829
that he's gonna drop tickets written by

982
00:42:10,289 --> 00:42:19,829
a cop because that cops a dick and you

983
00:42:13,829 --> 00:42:23,969
reported on this yeah and then we have

984
00:42:19,829 --> 00:42:25,639
another person saying the laws don't

985
00:42:23,969 --> 00:42:29,399
work and they state that they actually

986
00:42:25,639 --> 00:42:30,539
the drug cartels are profiting so it

987
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:32,130
looks like the people are starting to

988
00:42:30,539 --> 00:42:33,779
understand some people are starting to

989
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:36,720
see the light these are positive reasons

990
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:38,670
why we want to legalize cannabis so I'll

991
00:42:36,719 --> 00:42:40,980
get back into the article in the first

992
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:42,800
instance this was nothing short of a

993
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:45,480
prosecutor using it using his

994
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:47,130
prosecutorial discretion to avoid

995
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:49,769
wasting a lot of time in the courts and

996
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:51,599
more importantly to rain and rain in one

997
00:42:49,769 --> 00:42:53,429
police officer who was obviously on a

998
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:55,519
vendetta against the voters for passing

999
00:42:53,429 --> 00:42:58,619
in law he did not personally approve of

1000
00:42:55,519 --> 00:43:00,659
one single police officer Brisbane was

1001
00:42:58,619 --> 00:43:02,730
responsible for eight out of all ten

1002
00:43:00,659 --> 00:43:04,469
tickets issued in the Seattle for public

1003
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:06,090
in Seattle for public consumption of

1004
00:43:04,469 --> 00:43:08,579
marijuana during the first half of this

1005
00:43:06,090 --> 00:43:11,490
year the other 20% were written by the

1006
00:43:08,579 --> 00:43:13,170
entire rest of the police force to put

1007
00:43:11,489 --> 00:43:16,199
this in another way this officer wrote

1008
00:43:13,170 --> 00:43:18,389
one ticket he considered this officer on

1009
00:43:16,199 --> 00:43:21,419
one ticket row he considered the new

1010
00:43:18,389 --> 00:43:23,129
legalization law silly well the other

1011
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:25,730
off well the officer has been reassigned

1012
00:43:23,130 --> 00:43:28,019
to new duties after this came to light

1013
00:43:25,730 --> 00:43:29,789
there are a lot of folks with cases

1014
00:43:28,019 --> 00:43:32,610
still in the legal system as a result of

1015
00:43:29,789 --> 00:43:34,199
his actions what a dick of a cop

1016
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:35,280
cops don't realize what they're doing to

1017
00:43:34,199 --> 00:43:36,899
you when they screw you up for having

1018
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,490
some a little bit of weed or whatever

1019
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:40,920
you're doing they'll and some of them do

1020
00:43:38,489 --> 00:43:42,029
and they love it that [ __ ] sucks come on

1021
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:43,500
guys if you're a cop some cops are

1022
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:45,620
listening to the podcast I know you are

1023
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:47,760
I know you're a law enforcement officer

1024
00:43:45,619 --> 00:43:50,219
we want to educate you about how not

1025
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:54,030
dangerous cannabis is it's something

1026
00:43:50,219 --> 00:43:58,649
that asked us yeah I mean especially if

1027
00:43:54,030 --> 00:43:59,970
it's inform yourself listen to me I'm a

1028
00:43:58,650 --> 00:44:01,019
smart dude I'm an educated dude I'm

1029
00:43:59,969 --> 00:44:02,719
reading news I'm trying to educate

1030
00:44:01,019 --> 00:44:05,219
people I'm trying to keep people safe

1031
00:44:02,719 --> 00:44:07,439
people did you not just hear stoners

1032
00:44:05,219 --> 00:44:07,659
with words right there with ya that was

1033
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:10,000
a

1034
00:44:07,659 --> 00:44:11,588
that was impressive smokes pot not a bad

1035
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,298
person right yeah

1036
00:44:11,588 --> 00:44:15,489
in Washington State of course

1037
00:44:13,298 --> 00:44:16,989
recreational marijuana use is legal the

1038
00:44:15,489 --> 00:44:18,578
voters approve the change in state law

1039
00:44:16,989 --> 00:44:20,139
and the prosecutors actions quite

1040
00:44:18,579 --> 00:44:22,119
obviously reflect the peep the will of

1041
00:44:20,139 --> 00:44:24,009
the people but it didn't have to happen

1042
00:44:22,119 --> 00:44:26,079
this way prosecutors in general are

1043
00:44:24,010 --> 00:44:28,240
pretty much tough on crime types of

1044
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:30,309
people and if this particular prosecutor

1045
00:44:28,239 --> 00:44:31,689
has agreed with the cops way of thinking

1046
00:44:30,309 --> 00:44:33,910
then all these cases would have

1047
00:44:31,690 --> 00:44:34,960
continued to clog the legal system all

1048
00:44:33,909 --> 00:44:38,318
the way to the bitter end

1049
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:40,150
all $27 of it this prosecutor however

1050
00:44:38,318 --> 00:44:42,099
objected to that scenario and applied

1051
00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:43,900
some common sense he's even going the

1052
00:44:42,099 --> 00:44:46,119
extra mile and trying to refund fines

1053
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:48,190
already paid that is truly commendable

1054
00:44:46,119 --> 00:44:49,630
that is a truly commendable action once

1055
00:44:48,190 --> 00:44:53,260
again reflecting the will of the voters

1056
00:44:49,630 --> 00:44:54,608
in legal reality the second news item

1057
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:57,130
doesn't seem to deal with actual legal

1058
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:59,828
cases it comes from a prosecutor who no

1059
00:44:57,130 --> 00:45:01,900
longer works for the federal Department

1060
00:44:59,829 --> 00:45:04,539
of Justice still this is a stunning

1061
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:06,519
development federal prosecutors after

1062
00:45:04,539 --> 00:45:08,500
all are not bound by any state law and

1063
00:45:06,519 --> 00:45:10,389
therefore can apply federal law whether

1064
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:13,119
marijuana is still the most illegal of

1065
00:45:10,389 --> 00:45:14,650
all drugs a where marijuana is still the

1066
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:17,108
most legal of all drug illegal of all

1067
00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:19,450
drugs without even having to weigh in on

1068
00:45:17,108 --> 00:45:21,009
State Politics believe it or not there

1069
00:45:19,449 --> 00:45:22,929
are some extremely zealous federal

1070
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:24,549
prosecutors all up and down the west

1071
00:45:22,929 --> 00:45:26,469
coast who are fighting tooth and nail

1072
00:45:24,548 --> 00:45:29,710
against any state legalization efforts

1073
00:45:26,469 --> 00:45:31,808
an unprecedented and creative ways so

1074
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:34,869
hearing even a former prosecutor bluntly

1075
00:45:31,809 --> 00:45:36,400
refute the entire purpose of the federal

1076
00:45:34,869 --> 00:45:39,220
war on weed is a welcome development

1077
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:41,170
indeed the language used is a pretty

1078
00:45:39,219 --> 00:45:43,419
strong condemnation of federal laws

1079
00:45:41,170 --> 00:45:45,088
she upheld while in office enforced our

1080
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:47,048
marijuana laws and they don't work

1081
00:45:45,088 --> 00:45:48,699
prosecutors are practical people who

1082
00:45:47,048 --> 00:45:50,650
deal with the real end aftermath of

1083
00:45:48,699 --> 00:45:53,139
arresting marijuana users so the

1084
00:45:50,650 --> 00:45:55,510
argument used is not a ISM or is not a

1085
00:45:53,139 --> 00:45:58,118
moral one walking up marijuana users is

1086
00:45:55,510 --> 00:45:59,260
wrong or one of racial equality black

1087
00:45:58,119 --> 00:46:01,510
and brown people are treated differently

1088
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:04,059
by the court system or even a political

1089
00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:05,710
one the public's mood is shifted instead

1090
00:46:04,059 --> 00:46:07,420
it's a view from the front lines of the

1091
00:46:05,710 --> 00:46:09,250
drug war which relies on personal

1092
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:11,318
experience and applying federal laws and

1093
00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:13,449
the relative effectiveness of carrying

1094
00:46:11,318 --> 00:46:15,969
out this job I enforced our marijuana

1095
00:46:13,449 --> 00:46:18,679
laws and they don't work

1096
00:46:15,969 --> 00:46:21,019
so this person instead of just playing

1097
00:46:18,679 --> 00:46:23,179
by the book basically saying had we'd go

1098
00:46:21,019 --> 00:46:25,309
to jail had we'd go to jail had a lotta

1099
00:46:23,179 --> 00:46:26,779
we'd go to prison they're actually

1100
00:46:25,309 --> 00:46:28,519
looking at what they're doing to people

1101
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:31,400
like I was saying they're saying you had

1102
00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:33,199
some weed human quit smoking weed here's

1103
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:34,550
a fine get your [ __ ] together don't go

1104
00:46:33,199 --> 00:46:36,889
to prison forever don't go get butt

1105
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:42,680
raped they're taking some compassion

1106
00:46:36,889 --> 00:46:44,480
into this finally the story and that's

1107
00:46:42,679 --> 00:46:47,449
all you nine times out of ten you got to

1108
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:48,800
do yeah you know when you're going to

1109
00:46:47,449 --> 00:46:51,049
court and stand in front of the judge

1110
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:53,630
everybody just kind of pushes you behind

1111
00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:55,850
your lawyer or public detent pretender

1112
00:46:53,630 --> 00:46:58,430
you know sitting there and that's the

1113
00:46:55,849 --> 00:46:59,690
they say you have your day but a lot of

1114
00:46:58,429 --> 00:47:01,279
times they just ask you if you

1115
00:46:59,690 --> 00:47:05,150
understand and it's a yes or no question

1116
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:07,130
is all you really get so it's good

1117
00:47:05,150 --> 00:47:10,039
they're finally starting to be like what

1118
00:47:07,130 --> 00:47:12,079
did you have you know yeah so all right

1119
00:47:10,039 --> 00:47:13,820
so of all the pro legalization arguments

1120
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:16,309
this could perhaps be the strongest one

1121
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:17,660
the laws don't work they don't have the

1122
00:47:16,309 --> 00:47:19,309
intended effect the feds have been

1123
00:47:17,659 --> 00:47:21,679
fighting the war on weed for almost a

1124
00:47:19,309 --> 00:47:23,019
century now with precious little to show

1125
00:47:21,679 --> 00:47:26,779
for it

1126
00:47:23,019 --> 00:47:29,239
yeah and in fact they have severe

1127
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:31,670
unintended consequences joke cartel drug

1128
00:47:29,239 --> 00:47:34,369
cartels are pocketing all of the profits

1129
00:47:31,670 --> 00:47:36,680
therefore mindlessly continuing on the

1130
00:47:34,369 --> 00:47:38,389
same course is nothing short of madness

1131
00:47:36,679 --> 00:47:40,219
I think that's what they call insanity

1132
00:47:38,389 --> 00:47:41,569
Chris Wilson is not the first law

1133
00:47:40,219 --> 00:47:43,609
enforcement officer to have this

1134
00:47:41,570 --> 00:47:45,559
revelation and begin publicly trying to

1135
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:47,450
change the situation an entire

1136
00:47:45,559 --> 00:47:49,039
organization already exists Law

1137
00:47:47,449 --> 00:47:51,409
Enforcement Against Prohibition or leap

1138
00:47:49,039 --> 00:47:53,480
for members of the law enforcement

1139
00:47:51,409 --> 00:47:56,000
community past and present to advocate

1140
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:58,639
the marijuana legal reform many members

1141
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:00,500
are former cops who have first-hand who

1142
00:47:58,639 --> 00:48:02,539
saw firsthand how pointless the entire

1143
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:05,000
war on wheat truly was throughout their

1144
00:48:02,539 --> 00:48:06,259
careers now free to the prospect of

1145
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,940
ending their career over a public

1146
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:09,890
statement many are speaking out on the

1147
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:12,289
subject their message is a simple one

1148
00:48:09,889 --> 00:48:15,769
prohibition didn't work and prohibition

1149
00:48:12,289 --> 00:48:18,739
of marijuana isn't working either Chris

1150
00:48:15,769 --> 00:48:21,559
Olson is to be commended for raising her

1151
00:48:18,739 --> 00:48:23,269
own prosecute prosecutorial objection

1152
00:48:21,559 --> 00:48:24,679
and for knowing her public support

1153
00:48:23,269 --> 00:48:26,869
behind a ballot measure in the state

1154
00:48:24,679 --> 00:48:29,059
where she used to uphold the law the

1155
00:48:26,869 --> 00:48:31,250
personal connection to the state ballot

1156
00:48:29,059 --> 00:48:34,730
might convince a few voters even though

1157
00:48:31,250 --> 00:48:36,289
even tough-on-crime types that the sorry

1158
00:48:34,730 --> 00:48:37,599
let me move this page it's all scrolling

1159
00:48:36,289 --> 00:48:40,519
on its own there we go

1160
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:42,049
where were we all the rest of the

1161
00:48:40,519 --> 00:48:43,849
arguments aside the law needs changing

1162
00:48:42,050 --> 00:48:45,710
because it doesn't work it does nothing

1163
00:48:43,849 --> 00:48:47,269
sure of waste time for the entire

1164
00:48:45,710 --> 00:48:48,800
judicial system for something which

1165
00:48:47,269 --> 00:48:51,289
shouldn't even be illegal in the first

1166
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:53,570
place the Oregon ballot measure race may

1167
00:48:51,289 --> 00:48:55,789
be closed near Washington and Colorado

1168
00:48:53,570 --> 00:48:57,170
legalized recreational marijuana Oregon

1169
00:48:55,789 --> 00:48:59,840
had a similar but badly written

1170
00:48:57,170 --> 00:49:01,400
initiative on its ballot it failed this

1171
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:03,500
time around the effort is a lot more

1172
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:05,750
serious but reliable polling on the

1173
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:08,510
subject isn't a Tory ously hard to do so

1174
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:10,849
the vote might be very close in November

1175
00:49:08,510 --> 00:49:14,480
guys if you're in Oregon when this comes

1176
00:49:10,849 --> 00:49:16,789
up go vote to legalize cannabis so

1177
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:18,440
pro-legalization groups will be very

1178
00:49:16,789 --> 00:49:21,230
closely watching the vote this year in

1179
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:24,409
Oregon and Alaska and Washington DC so

1180
00:49:21,230 --> 00:49:26,170
assuming Lee assumably sorry my throat's

1181
00:49:24,409 --> 00:49:29,329
burning out I'm trying to go fast

1182
00:49:26,170 --> 00:49:31,130
assumably they'll also be closely

1183
00:49:29,329 --> 00:49:33,619
watching the impact of Olson simple the

1184
00:49:31,130 --> 00:49:35,150
laws don't work message Olson's message

1185
00:49:33,619 --> 00:49:37,210
is a powerful one because it could reach

1186
00:49:35,150 --> 00:49:39,800
voters not generally open to other

1187
00:49:37,210 --> 00:49:41,630
pro-legalization arguments if you're a

1188
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:43,700
law and order type of voter a formal

1189
00:49:41,630 --> 00:49:45,200
former federal prosecutors opinion

1190
00:49:43,699 --> 00:49:47,599
should carry some weight in other words

1191
00:49:45,199 --> 00:49:49,909
perhaps more prosecutors both state and

1192
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:51,949
federal both current and former can be

1193
00:49:49,909 --> 00:49:54,409
enlisted in this movement as I said it

1194
00:49:51,949 --> 00:49:55,699
is far too early to call this any sort

1195
00:49:54,409 --> 00:49:58,279
of trend but it certainly is a

1196
00:49:55,699 --> 00:50:00,409
development worth taking note of Dan on

1197
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:02,350
the legal theme we began on perhaps new

1198
00:50:00,409 --> 00:50:07,730
voters will sustain these prosecutors

1199
00:50:02,349 --> 00:50:09,739
objections and you can follow chris on

1200

it's glad to see the people or just open

1207
00:50:29,329 --> 00:50:38,299
for debate at least yeah and maybe like

1208
00:50:34,250 --> 00:50:40,250
they said maybe now that the state has

1209
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:42,320
melted the older people don't want to

1210
00:50:40,250 --> 00:50:42,949
hear from you and me then weed is

1211
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:45,019
harmless

1212
00:50:42,949 --> 00:50:46,429
cannabis is helpful that medical

1213
00:50:45,019 --> 00:50:48,349
marijuana will help you people don't

1214
00:50:46,429 --> 00:50:51,199
want to hear that but if you're a farmer

1215
00:50:48,349 --> 00:50:52,550
if you're a former from the Fed then

1216
00:50:51,199 --> 00:50:54,399
they have to listen to you because

1217
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:57,349
you're obviously not full of [ __ ] oh

1218
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:58,700
well at least they should trust you

1219
00:50:57,349 --> 00:51:00,440
because you're the one been feeding them

1220
00:50:58,699 --> 00:51:03,980
the [ __ ] for the best you know however

1221
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:05,659
many years so well now what do we

1222
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:07,190

00:51:05,659 --> 00:51:10,159
that you told us for many many years or

1224
00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:11,990
do we believe your new [ __ ] soon as

1225
00:51:10,159 --> 00:51:13,489
we start believing the new [ __ ] from

1226
00:51:11,989 --> 00:51:16,098
the person that used to be like

1227

1352
00:58:52,420 --> 00:58:55,510
[Music]

1353
00:58:57,329 --> 00:59:03,789
so Spence is the winner of the mountain

1354
00:59:00,909 --> 00:59:05,379
region secret cup some people might not

1355
00:59:03,789 --> 00:59:07,358
be familiar with the secret cup so let's

1356
00:59:05,380 --> 00:59:11,829
take a little bit to tell them what that

1357
00:59:07,358 --> 00:59:14,318
is oh the secret cup is a it's actually

1358
00:59:11,829 --> 00:59:16,568
a tour which they go to different places

1359
00:59:14,318 --> 00:59:19,900
they go to places in Cali if I'm correct

1360
00:59:16,568 --> 00:59:21,789
I don't know if it's ever been put that

1361
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:23,318
way as a tour because that would be a

1362
00:59:21,789 --> 00:59:37,719
hell of a marketing way to put some

1363
00:59:23,318 --> 00:59:38,650
shirts out here maybe Michigan not sure

1364
00:59:37,719 --> 00:59:41,048
Arizona

1365
00:59:38,650 --> 00:59:43,930
Rhode Island and then all that it's

1366
00:59:41,048 --> 00:59:47,650
basically a competition of anywhere from

1367
00:59:43,929 --> 00:59:51,759
30 to 40 hash makers all in ER a certain

1368
00:59:47,650 --> 00:59:53,769
amount of product and then each one of

1369
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:55,119
the people that enter are considered

1370
00:59:53,769 --> 00:59:57,159
judges because we all receive a judge

1371
00:59:55,119 --> 01:00:00,760
pack go through them and kind of give

1372
00:59:57,159 --> 01:00:03,129
everything a score from smell you know

1373
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:07,690
strength smoothness harshness color

1374
01:00:03,130 --> 01:00:11,470
flavor you know lunch so each contestant

1375
01:00:07,690 --> 01:00:13,929
actually gets 0.3 of every sample right

1376
01:00:11,469 --> 01:00:20,230
yeah you get to taste what everybody

1377
01:00:13,929 --> 01:00:22,118
else has a good thing about is you know

1378
01:00:20,230 --> 01:00:25,039
it's not being judged by just you know

1379
01:00:22,119 --> 01:00:27,739
random people or like

1380
01:00:25,039 --> 01:00:29,299
just it's not a most technically is a

1381
01:00:27,739 --> 01:00:33,199
blind judge there's nobody gets to see

1382
01:00:29,298 --> 01:00:34,788
what you know yeah so it's all just

1383
01:00:33,199 --> 01:00:36,469
numbered and whatever numbers are what

1384
01:00:34,789 --> 01:00:38,778
you vote for so when you got your

1385
01:00:36,469 --> 01:00:41,929
judge's kid how long did it take you to

1386
01:00:38,778 --> 01:00:43,759
find your your entry like two minutes

1387
01:00:41,929 --> 01:00:47,689
two minutes yeah yours you just had a

1388
01:00:43,759 --> 01:00:51,199
lot of taste I just in trees and kind of

1389
01:00:47,688 --> 01:00:55,118
just smell and I make the hash you kind

1390
01:00:51,199 --> 01:00:55,119
of get attached I guess you could say

1391
01:00:58,358 --> 01:01:03,768
you find it it's perfect yeah that's it

1392
01:01:01,309 --> 01:01:05,239
I could tell my flowers sorry guys I'm

1393
01:01:03,768 --> 01:01:06,498
all choked up actually I went to the

1394
01:01:05,239 --> 01:01:08,599
secret cup for two days and took a

1395
01:01:06,498 --> 01:01:09,708
amazing amount of dabs and then today I

1396
01:01:08,599 --> 01:01:11,989
would hang out some friends in Denver

1397
01:01:09,708 --> 01:01:13,639
and my lungs and throat are burnt out

1398
01:01:11,989 --> 01:01:14,809
from dab and you guys got a hydrate if

1399
01:01:13,639 --> 01:01:16,818
you're dabbing that's something that I'm

1400
01:01:14,809 --> 01:01:18,829
learning more hydration Spence reaches

1401
01:01:16,818 --> 01:01:22,759
for the water as I say that we're all

1402
01:01:18,829 --> 01:01:24,528
red eyed and throat dried so yeah

1403
01:01:22,759 --> 01:01:26,119
everybody got to I had the honor of

1404
01:01:24,528 --> 01:01:28,338
tasting a couple of my friends were

1405
01:01:26,119 --> 01:01:29,239
judges and entrance contenders I don't

1406
01:01:28,338 --> 01:01:30,768
know what the hell they were called they

1407
01:01:29,239 --> 01:01:32,539
were judges and they entered and I got

1408
01:01:30,768 --> 01:01:36,678
to taste parts of their sample packs

1409
01:01:32,539 --> 01:01:38,449
some were amazing some I don't think I

1410
01:01:36,679 --> 01:01:40,809
would take a second dad loved a lot of

1411
01:01:38,449 --> 01:01:46,418
those yeah I mean there's definitely

1412
01:01:40,809 --> 01:01:49,519
there was 38 competitors in this one so

1413
01:01:46,418 --> 01:01:52,129
38.3 you've got to go through and you

1414
01:01:49,518 --> 01:01:53,658
know it's kind of tough depending on

1415
01:01:52,130 --> 01:01:55,849
which kind of what kind of like I'm a

1416
01:01:53,659 --> 01:01:57,709
wheat snob so I'm definitely gonna be an

1417
01:01:55,849 --> 01:01:59,749
oil snob you know I'm saying so it's

1418
01:01:57,708 --> 01:02:01,489
just a lot of it's personal preference

1419
01:01:59,748 --> 01:02:03,379
whether or not you like it this way you

1420
01:02:01,489 --> 01:02:05,688
like it that way so it's kind of that's

1421
01:02:03,380 --> 01:02:07,929
why it's good that were the judges

1422
01:02:05,688 --> 01:02:09,949
because it's at least honest opinions I

1423
01:02:07,929 --> 01:02:12,079
wanted to wait a little bit to get into

1424
01:02:09,949 --> 01:02:13,668
live resin but I was worried with you

1425
01:02:12,079 --> 01:02:15,859
entering live resin people were gonna

1426
01:02:13,668 --> 01:02:18,379
say it's not stable because the popular

1427
01:02:15,858 --> 01:02:20,869
[ __ ] the rage is shattered and the live

1428
01:02:18,380 --> 01:02:22,880
resin is not chattery at all it's kind

1429
01:02:20,869 --> 01:02:28,369
of it looks like it's loyal yeah it's

1430
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:30,459
like you know it's I think somebody said

1431
01:02:28,369 --> 01:02:33,619
66 degrees is when it actually gets

1432
01:02:30,458 --> 01:02:35,598
it'll shatter if you're if your house is

1433
01:02:33,619 --> 01:02:37,720
66 degrees you like your house cold

1434
01:02:35,599 --> 01:02:39,700
you'll have chattery live residence

1435
01:02:37,719 --> 01:02:41,139
but it's almost that in here tonight

1436
01:02:39,699 --> 01:02:42,909
it's getting nice and cool Alvarado

1437
01:02:41,139 --> 01:02:46,118

1438
01:02:42,909 --> 01:02:47,710

1439
01:02:46,119 --> 01:02:49,420
thanks dude the other day you gave me a

1440
01:02:47,710 --> 01:02:50,889
little sample of Earl and I didn't even

1441
01:02:49,420 --> 01:02:52,780
realize that I've been dabbing off of

1442
01:02:50,889 --> 01:02:57,759
the entry I've been dabbing the winter

1443
01:02:52,780 --> 01:02:59,830
hair for several days thank you tasty so

1444
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:02,080
in a second we'll talk about what's in

1445
01:02:59,829 --> 01:03:04,449
that the event we kind of talked about

1446
01:03:02,079 --> 01:03:06,489
what it is the people that enter the

1447
01:03:04,449 --> 01:03:09,879
judges we every buddy gets to taste the

1448
01:03:06,489 --> 01:03:12,339
entries so that's what it's all about

1449
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:14,740
and Spence was actually chosen as the

1450
01:03:12,340 --> 01:03:15,730
overall champion there's a couple of the

1451
01:03:14,739 --> 01:03:20,319
things I want to talk about there was

1452
01:03:15,730 --> 01:03:24,010
two location changes I was if not if you

1453
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:26,200
could probably count three yeah switched

1454
01:03:24,010 --> 01:03:28,030
twice I want to give a huge shout out to

1455
01:03:26,199 --> 01:03:30,909
Big D right now Big D was smart enough

1456
01:03:28,030 --> 01:03:33,580
he hired a professional event company

1457
01:03:30,909 --> 01:03:35,529
who hired hired the right event services

1458
01:03:33,579 --> 01:03:36,730
group right event groups or something

1459
01:03:35,530 --> 01:03:39,760

energy from us in city seat um and it

01:05:56,989 --> 01:06:04,429
was mixed with Scott Shoji from air tank

1514
01:05:59,329 --> 01:06:23,269
this classy mix yeah yeah the synergy

1515
01:06:04,429 --> 01:06:25,730
was a kosher cush dominant yeah Scott 2g

1516

was just an awesome og nice it was

1517
01:06:25,730 --> 01:06:31,639

1518
01:06:30,110 --> 01:06:34,660
tall but it was you know taller than I

1519
01:06:31,639 --> 01:06:39,589
would usually like plans to be but um

1520
01:06:34,659 --> 01:06:43,069
super fuel II a heavy indica just you

1521
01:06:39,590 --> 01:06:45,320
know awesome resin production and a

1522
01:06:43,070 --> 01:06:46,970
pretty decent yield err - oh that was

1523
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:49,760
the one I mix with the sins which was a

1524
01:06:46,969 --> 01:06:52,989
kosher dominate which the Sensoji is

1525
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:55,390
blue power and kosher fish

1526
01:06:52,989 --> 01:06:58,239
so there was a kosher kosher kosher

1527
01:06:55,389 --> 01:07:02,049
dominant um FINA I just had a way better

1528
01:06:58,239 --> 01:07:05,279
kosher like burnt rubber is she smell

1529
01:07:02,050 --> 01:07:09,190
which comes out in hash as an OG smell

1530
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:11,200
it's got a few li functionally has a few

1531
01:07:09,190 --> 01:07:13,510
li funk to it it's delicious

1532
01:07:11,199 --> 01:07:15,639
I smoked a lot of sativas because like

1533
01:07:13,510 --> 01:07:17,260
you said I'm a sativa breeder I smoke a

1534
01:07:15,639 --> 01:07:19,480
lot of the sativa or a lot of sativa in

1535
01:07:17,260 --> 01:07:20,920
this indica kind of dominance in here it

1536
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:22,838
really sits me down it makes my eyes

1537
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:25,269
droopy I really appreciate it it's

1538
01:07:22,838 --> 01:07:27,549
really not a really nice cross what's

1539
01:07:25,269 --> 01:07:29,710
got the citrusy spice to it what's that

1540
01:07:27,550 --> 01:07:31,950
and that there's like sort of a spice to

1541
01:07:29,710 --> 01:07:38,139
the end it's almost got a lemony citrus

1542
01:07:31,949 --> 01:07:40,149
it comes from the Scot okay like that oh

1543
01:07:38,139 --> 01:07:44,219
gee pine this and sometimes the pond can

1544
01:07:40,150 --> 01:07:46,990
transfer over to like a citrusy lemon um

1545
01:07:44,219 --> 01:07:49,719

01:08:46,750 --> 01:08:51,939
literally go plant to plant and just you

1571
01:08:49,779 --> 01:08:54,609
know you can't you can't do it in the

1572
01:08:51,939 --> 01:08:56,919
day it kind of takes you know a week or

1573
01:08:54,609 --> 01:08:58,449
two you know as they're finishing to be

1574
01:08:56,920 --> 01:08:59,509
able to tell which flavors are gonna

1575
01:08:58,448 --> 01:09:00,039
come through

1576
01:08:59,509 --> 01:09:02,270
Oh

1577
01:09:00,039 --> 01:09:04,640
[Music]

1578
01:09:02,270 --> 01:09:06,560
I was only ever think I was gonna do I

1579
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:09,319
made another batch the green ribbon

1580
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:11,390
batch um but the green ribbon just

1581
01:09:09,319 --> 01:09:12,830
didn't carry it the same like when you

1582
01:09:11,390 --> 01:09:15,710
feel some plants you know how they're

1583
01:09:12,829 --> 01:09:17,269
like some plants like super sticky where

1584
01:09:15,710 --> 01:09:18,859
you touch them and then your fingers are

1585
01:09:17,270 --> 01:09:20,480
stuck together and there's some you

1586
01:09:18,859 --> 01:09:22,310
touch and you get like the string penis

1587
01:09:20,479 --> 01:09:23,929
present and then there's some you touch

1588
01:09:22,310 --> 01:09:25,850
where it's like just wet where you don't

1589
01:09:23,930 --> 01:09:27,200
even it's like slick uh-huh

1590
01:09:25,850 --> 01:09:29,810
so you just kind of go and look for

1591
01:09:27,199 --> 01:09:32,298

dollar for that one I owe a dollar every

1618
01:10:38,119 --> 01:10:44,960
time I say the f-word on the show yeah

1619
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:47,000
will you teach me and our listeners a

1620
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:50,020
little lesson about what live resin is

1621
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:50,020
and kind of how it's done

1622
01:10:50,489 --> 01:10:55,420
okay so everybody's heard of fresh

1623
01:10:53,289 --> 01:10:58,210
frozen bubble hash so basically where

1624
01:10:55,420 --> 01:11:01,960
you harvest your plant you essentially

1625
01:10:58,210 --> 01:11:03,640
freeze it or flash freeze it um and then

1626
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:07,710
for ice hash you'd you know wash it in

1627
01:11:03,640 --> 01:11:10,869
your bags or whatever so now instead of

1628
01:11:07,710 --> 01:11:12,939
you know as far as opening blasting I

1629
01:11:10,869 --> 01:11:16,239
know people who do it live resin but I

1630
01:11:12,939 --> 01:11:17,829
think it's what the closed closed loop

1631
01:11:16,239 --> 01:11:19,809
game came out and we figured out you

1632
01:11:17,829 --> 01:11:22,659
could do that same process in a closed

1633
01:11:19,810 --> 01:11:25,780
loop at a bigger scale it completely

1634
01:11:22,659 --> 01:11:37,269
changes patched for the better in my

1635
01:11:25,779 --> 01:11:39,729
opinion I think so if done proper that

1636
01:11:37,270 --> 01:11:42,190
one he's taking plants that are ready

1637
01:11:39,729 --> 01:11:43,989
for harvest chop them down freeze them

1638
01:11:42,189 --> 01:11:46,929
in the deep freeze and then put them in

1639
01:11:43,989 --> 01:11:49,329
a closed loop butane extraction system

1640
01:11:46,930 --> 01:11:50,560
which we'll talk more about that

1641
01:11:49,329 --> 01:11:52,479
I think Kevin and I have talked about

1642
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:54,460
that but there's open blasting and

1643
01:11:52,479 --> 01:11:56,500
closed loop Spence uses a closed loop

1644
01:11:54,460 --> 01:11:58,810
method and blasts the fresh frozen like

1645
01:11:56,500 --> 01:12:03,489
that does it need to be vacuumed first

1646
01:11:58,810 --> 01:12:07,840
after that yeah once it comes to Mew

1647
01:12:03,489 --> 01:12:09,550
it's really you know it takes a lot of

1648
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:13,690
the butane out before you even get to

1649
01:12:09,550 --> 01:12:15,900
touch the product so it pumps it out

1650
01:12:13,689 --> 01:12:17,949
because it takes all the liquid back out

1651
01:12:15,899 --> 01:12:22,119
you know so then you're left which is

1652
01:12:17,949 --> 01:12:24,429
your product um as far as you know

1653
01:12:22,119 --> 01:12:26,470
flavors I really think it keeps a better

1654
01:12:24,430 --> 01:12:27,520
term profile it honestly if you can

1655
01:12:26,470 --> 01:12:29,740
alright so this is gonna be kind of hard

1656
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:31,990
to understand but it tastes like it

1657
01:12:29,739 --> 01:12:34,000
smells when it's growing if you could

1658
01:12:31,989 --> 01:12:35,529
understand what you know you touch a

1659
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:37,779
plant and you smell your fingers that

1660
01:12:35,529 --> 01:12:39,729
crazy smell you get that it doesn't ever

1661
01:12:37,779 --> 01:12:44,019
smell like that once it's dried and

1662
01:12:39,729 --> 01:12:46,539
cured but once you when you're stripping

1663
01:12:44,020 --> 01:12:48,820
or making hash from a fresh product you

1664
01:12:46,539 --> 01:12:50,979
get that fresh flavor it's like if your

1665
01:12:48,819 --> 01:12:52,420
bud was approved and you took a bite out

1666
01:12:50,979 --> 01:12:55,439
of that fruit that's what this hash

1667
01:12:52,420 --> 01:12:57,329
tastes like yeah and I love it

1668
01:12:55,439 --> 01:12:58,979
de turpan annoyed and that's the other

1669
01:12:57,329 --> 01:13:00,750
profile in there and that's just not

1670
01:12:58,979 --> 01:13:02,099
everyone's one new word now is Terps

1671
01:13:00,750 --> 01:13:04,079
terpstra yeah so I just feel like an

1672
01:13:02,100 --> 01:13:06,870
[ __ ] every time I say Terps but the

1673
01:13:04,079 --> 01:13:08,550
Terps in that is trippy Slurpee it's

1674
01:13:06,869 --> 01:13:10,069
just like a big it's like a bite of

1675
01:13:08,550 --> 01:13:13,560
candy every time you hit a dab it

1676
01:13:10,069 --> 01:13:15,329
literally like it could be desert one

1677
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:18,000
somebody needs to make some Jillybean

1678
01:13:15,329 --> 01:13:20,279
life resin oh don't worry there's do

1679
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:23,550
this crazy that crisis a blueberry Sour

1680
01:13:20,279 --> 01:13:24,689
Diesel that sounds ridiculous doesn't it

1681
01:13:23,550 --> 01:13:32,369
sounds delicious

1682
01:13:24,689 --> 01:13:33,989
yeah yeah I made cookies live it was we

1683
01:13:32,369 --> 01:13:36,229
got across some tangi and some grateful

1684
01:13:33,989 --> 01:13:36,229
dog

1685
01:13:36,599 --> 01:13:41,190
see the tangerine dog the look on your

1686
01:13:38,908 --> 01:13:42,539
face tangerine dog I've been writing

1687
01:13:41,189 --> 01:13:43,979
down strained names guys if you have

1688
01:13:42,539 --> 01:13:45,719
neat straight names you can feel free to

1689
01:13:43,979 --> 01:13:48,448
tweet those to me at microculture I

1690
01:13:45,719 --> 01:13:50,189
might use one of them I might send you a

1691
01:13:48,448 --> 01:13:55,678
pack of it when I make it if I remember

1692
01:13:50,189 --> 01:13:59,069
and if I can find you to eat but yes

1693
01:13:55,679 --> 01:14:00,960
saliva is basically you know from fresh

1694
01:13:59,069 --> 01:14:08,158
frozen vho just I think it's a more

1695
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:09,480
flavor goes into an oven after you know

1696
01:14:08,158 --> 01:14:12,059
you're extracted from your system

1697
01:14:09,479 --> 01:14:14,908
because your system takes pretty much

1698
01:14:12,060 --> 01:14:16,619
good majority of it out so but she still

1699
01:14:14,908 --> 01:14:17,848
got to go through your vacuum process to

1700
01:14:16,618 --> 01:14:21,328
you know keep cleaning and removing

1701
01:14:17,849 --> 01:14:23,400
certain gases stuff like that do you

1702
01:14:21,328 --> 01:14:25,408
know do you do anything special to your

1703
01:14:23,399 --> 01:14:27,029
plants or flowers uh if you know you're

1704
01:14:25,408 --> 01:14:37,799
gonna make oil out of them for live

1705
01:14:27,029 --> 01:14:39,899
resin was it 48 hours of dark before but

1706
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:41,730
no I really think with this far is live

1707
01:14:39,899 --> 01:14:44,819
it's all about the product you put in

1708
01:14:41,729 --> 01:14:46,948
you know the better you know the flowers

1709
01:14:44,819 --> 01:14:48,599
that are going in the better the oils

1710
01:14:46,948 --> 01:14:51,948
gonna come out so no trim run in this

1711
01:14:48,599 --> 01:14:55,469
room right yeah I'll pass no trim run

1712
01:14:51,948 --> 01:14:57,569
honestly from my trim like my personal

1713
01:14:55,469 --> 01:15:10,319
stuff I still open blast it and I'll

1714
01:14:57,569 --> 01:15:11,849
make it it's even smoke and shatter I

1715
01:15:10,319 --> 01:15:15,149
can tell the difference in oak and Earl

1716
01:15:11,849 --> 01:15:17,449
nug run and trim run yeah definitely you

1717
01:15:15,149 --> 01:15:20,309
can taste once you start smoking live

1718
01:15:17,448 --> 01:15:22,348
you can taste the difference between if

1719
01:15:20,310 --> 01:15:24,300
it's in a closed loop and if it's not in

1720
01:15:22,349 --> 01:15:27,900
the closed loop I feel super spoiled now

1721
01:15:24,300 --> 01:15:30,389
that I smoke so much like it's a good I

1722
01:15:27,899 --> 01:15:34,379
find myself hiding my live like just

1723
01:15:30,389 --> 01:15:36,029
over here and we can smoke this shatter

1724
01:15:34,380 --> 01:15:37,869
all day the live resin I'll bark at you

1725
01:15:36,029 --> 01:15:40,389
like a dog if you get in there

1726
01:15:37,869 --> 01:15:41,890
yeah all right so a little bit more

1727
01:15:40,390 --> 01:15:43,840
about the secret cup stuff dude you're a

1728
01:15:41,890 --> 01:15:45,910
freaking champion now bro you are a

1729
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:50,079
secret cup winner has it sunk in yet

1730
01:15:45,909 --> 01:15:53,170
oh no well what's funny is about this is

1731
01:15:50,079 --> 01:15:56,739
I went to what was it secret cup last

1732
01:15:53,170 --> 01:15:58,840
year when they had it in Denver with a

1733
01:15:56,739 --> 01:16:00,519
couple buddies of mine and that was like

1734
01:15:58,840 --> 01:16:03,579
right when I was really first getting

1735
01:16:00,520 --> 01:16:07,080
into really making like oil like more

1736
01:16:03,579 --> 01:16:10,269
than just you know every now and then um

1737
01:16:07,079 --> 01:16:11,739
and I remember telling everybody I was

1738
01:16:10,270 --> 01:16:13,060
like dude we're gonna enter this Cup

1739
01:16:11,739 --> 01:16:15,779
next year and we're gonna win it and

1740
01:16:13,060 --> 01:16:18,070
then you know a year later we [ __ ] oh

1741
01:16:15,779 --> 01:16:19,840
my bad you could say whatever you want

1742
01:16:18,069 --> 01:16:21,429
I'm just trying not to say [ __ ] that's

1743
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:25,140
another dollar actually every time I say

1744
01:16:21,430 --> 01:16:25,140
it I owe a dollar to a charity so

1745
01:16:25,159 --> 01:16:29,680
[Music]

1746
01:16:27,250 --> 01:16:33,039
as I said we were gonna win it and we

1747
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:35,409
came out and you know brought I think we

1748
01:16:33,039 --> 01:16:38,409
came real proper and a lot of the

1749
01:16:35,409 --> 01:16:39,849
differences between I think which I

1750
01:16:38,409 --> 01:16:41,920
don't speak for everybody you know

1751
01:16:39,850 --> 01:16:44,470
because I don't you know I don't know

1752
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:47,050
everybody that competed but like we

1753
01:16:44,470 --> 01:16:48,699
didn't have to source our product we

1754
01:16:47,050 --> 01:16:50,980
were able to actually go pick it and I

1755
01:16:48,699 --> 01:16:52,630
think that made a difference different

1756
01:16:50,979 --> 01:16:55,299
flavor being able to pick certain

1757
01:16:52,630 --> 01:16:57,340
flavors and knowing what you want - you

1758
01:16:55,300 --> 01:16:59,560
know it was just easy I would I would

1759
01:16:57,340 --> 01:17:01,270
hate to have to go source you know

1760
01:16:59,560 --> 01:17:03,400
changes find something that's good

1761
01:17:01,270 --> 01:17:05,830
enough to actually have a guy that comes

1762
01:17:03,399 --> 01:17:12,819
straight to me for his material yeah

1763
01:17:05,829 --> 01:17:16,750
he's always like bro for sure for sure

1764
01:17:12,819 --> 01:17:19,719
home and then I grow weed first before I

1765
01:17:16,750 --> 01:17:21,699
make hash so you know it's it's a lot

1766
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:23,650
different when you spend ten weeks with

1767
01:17:21,699 --> 01:17:25,569
the plant and then make hash instead of

1768
01:17:23,649 --> 01:17:28,059
buying it off the shelf and making hash

1769
01:17:25,569 --> 01:17:30,609
with it it's a lot more full circle yeah

1770
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:33,720
um which is important to us because we

1771
01:17:30,609 --> 01:17:37,960
say it's grown by us process bus and

1772
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:40,360
seed to live resin to a cup yeah nice

1773
01:17:37,960 --> 01:17:41,829
that's that's super awesome so it's it's

1774
01:17:40,359 --> 01:17:44,109
cool it's been a fun experience hasn't

1775
01:17:41,829 --> 01:17:46,239
really I don't know if it's sink in

1776
01:17:44,109 --> 01:17:49,359
because I wasn't you know honestly I

1777
01:17:46,239 --> 01:17:51,819
went in with thinking I was gonna have a

1778
01:17:49,359 --> 01:17:55,000
top-three finish that's just how I'm

1779
01:17:51,819 --> 01:17:57,099
just competitive I hate losing um so it

1780
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:59,050
was cool being able to go in I almost

1781
01:17:57,100 --> 01:18:00,700
thought I lost once they did all the

1782
01:17:59,050 --> 01:18:02,529
awards and in third second I was like oh

1783
01:18:00,699 --> 01:18:04,989
no we didn't win that's something I

1784
01:18:02,529 --> 01:18:07,389
wanted to ask you I they did they did

1785
01:18:04,989 --> 01:18:09,460
like highest CBD they did best Terps

1786
01:18:07,390 --> 01:18:11,520
they did crowd choice or something like

1787
01:18:09,460 --> 01:18:11,520
that

1788
01:18:11,670 --> 01:18:18,640
and then they do third second and then

1789
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:20,199
Big D said so first place and he said

1790
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:22,810
something to the equivalent of you guys

1791
01:18:20,199 --> 01:18:24,279
already know who it is and I was like oh

1792
01:18:22,810 --> 01:18:25,690
then it's probably somebody that's

1793
01:18:24,279 --> 01:18:28,090
already gotten an award yeah that's what

1794
01:18:25,689 --> 01:18:29,679
I assumed but then he said Garden and as

1795
01:18:28,090 --> 01:18:30,069
soon as he said Garden I think I peed a

1796
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:32,360
little

1797
01:18:30,069 --> 01:18:35,750
I was like wow

1798
01:18:32,359 --> 01:18:37,849
he went through and did second place and

1799
01:18:35,750 --> 01:18:39,710
it was the bubble which the boat was far

1800
01:18:37,850 --> 01:18:41,389
I'll give it that you know I'm saying um

1801
01:18:39,710 --> 01:18:41,750
I didn't even know it was bubble that

1802
01:18:41,389 --> 01:18:45,739
want

1803
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:48,050
yeah the solvent less bubble but I

1804
01:18:45,738 --> 01:18:56,000
looked at Mattie and I was like we might

1805
01:18:48,050 --> 01:18:58,029
not win I wasn't thinking I was gonna

1806
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:02,510
win so like my speech was super like

1807
01:18:58,029 --> 01:19:04,519
short and to the point I guess you could

1808
01:19:02,510 --> 01:19:06,500
say it was it was perfect you said

1809
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:08,060
something about where you're from this

1810
01:19:06,500 --> 01:19:09,380
is illegal so it's great to be here with

1811
01:19:08,060 --> 01:19:11,360
all these people making hash and

1812
01:19:09,380 --> 01:19:14,029
celebrating and we're sure that's pretty

1813
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:22,069
dumb pretty awesome you didn't know

1814
01:19:14,029 --> 01:19:24,170
you're gonna win you know I think we

1815
01:19:22,069 --> 01:19:26,299
really just put in everything we had

1816
01:19:24,170 --> 01:19:28,730
into the competition so it paid off for

1817
01:19:26,300 --> 01:19:35,600
us there any other samples that stood

1818
01:19:28,729 --> 01:19:37,789

1823
01:19:52,158 --> 01:19:57,679
guys out here doing you know my same

1824
01:19:54,050 --> 01:20:02,150
technique that are killing it um I'm

1825
01:19:57,679 --> 01:20:05,840
gonna say he was regarding me his was on

1826
01:20:02,149 --> 01:20:09,198
point he did it it was sour D deep chunk

1827
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:10,730
and Gorilla Glue I think it was just it

1828
01:20:09,198 --> 01:20:14,210
was really good but it was just too

1829
01:20:10,729 --> 01:20:15,819
complex it wasn't like straight to the

1830
01:20:14,210 --> 01:20:18,050
not straight to the point but just

1831
01:20:15,819 --> 01:20:20,299
there's like the glue and the sour

1832
01:20:18,050 --> 01:20:22,730
almost the same thing and the deep chunk

1833
01:20:20,300 --> 01:20:24,020
is I think a Sour Diesel deep shock or

1834
01:20:22,729 --> 01:20:26,899
something like that it's just a

1835
01:20:24,020 --> 01:20:28,459
perfectly strange I think if you would

1836
01:20:26,899 --> 01:20:30,708
have done

1837
01:20:28,458 --> 01:20:32,479
the sour Dean the glue would have been a

1838
01:20:30,708 --> 01:20:34,670
hole it would came out a whole lot

1839
01:20:32,479 --> 01:20:36,469
better in my opinion I think the flavors

1840
01:20:34,670 --> 01:20:38,828
would have pulled through just that sour

1841
01:20:36,469 --> 01:20:38,828
with

1842
01:20:40,119 --> 01:20:44,859
was it saint gorilla glue acrylic glue

1843
01:20:42,340 --> 01:20:46,239
is basic for the old school sours I'm

1844
01:20:44,859 --> 01:20:49,239
like a big gorilla cool it was a

1845
01:20:46,239 --> 01:20:50,529
ridiculous plant bro yeah some crazy

1846
01:20:49,239 --> 01:20:52,359
[ __ ] I've got one growing right now you

1847
01:20:50,529 --> 01:20:54,699
gotta tie it down and it will break the

1848
01:20:52,359 --> 01:20:56,529
tie downs it's like no I literally had

1849
01:20:54,699 --> 01:20:59,260
worn the head I think it started with

1850
01:20:56,529 --> 01:21:01,179
three tops literally just as it would

1851
01:20:59,260 --> 01:21:03,789
girl we're just super crop each top down

1852
01:21:01,180 --> 01:21:07,030
and then now it has like a teen top's

1853
01:21:03,789 --> 01:21:11,350
have a 10-gallon girl that has 25 stakes

1854
01:21:07,029 --> 01:21:12,729
in it I'm gonna have to take a plant out

1855
01:21:11,350 --> 01:21:14,350
of the room or something because these

1856
01:21:12,729 --> 01:21:19,119
two gorillas glues are taking more space

1857
01:21:14,350 --> 01:21:21,100
than I completely predicted yeah yeah

1858
01:21:19,119 --> 01:21:22,449
yeah and I read the cross too and I'm

1859
01:21:21,100 --> 01:21:27,130
not surprised that it's so killer now

1860
01:21:22,449 --> 01:21:28,210
that I know what is it Kim yeah yeah

1861
01:21:27,130 --> 01:21:29,140

01:21:28,210 --> 01:21:30,369
were talking about the chocolate I'm

1863

the hydro culture podcast I had a great

2270
01:41:58,238 --> 01:42:02,079
long discussion with Mike and Jesse it

2271
01:42:00,488 --> 01:42:05,319
starts off with some random chatter I

2272
01:42:02,079 --> 01:42:07,630
decided to hit record in the show so

2273
01:42:05,319 --> 01:42:32,738
without further ado here comes the

2274
01:42:07,630 --> 01:42:35,889
podcast so six years ago Mike and I were

2275
01:42:32,738 --> 01:42:39,789
employed at a dispensary together I was

2276
01:42:35,889 --> 01:42:42,219
mostly the dude in charge I managed I

2277
01:42:39,789 --> 01:42:45,130
thought I applied for the job with you

2278
01:42:42,219 --> 01:42:46,510
and then like I was told you weren't the

2279
01:42:45,130 --> 01:42:48,010
manager and then you were them and I

2280
01:42:46,510 --> 01:42:50,619
don't know that place had structure

2281
01:42:48,010 --> 01:42:52,929
issues right yeah yes definitely

2282
01:42:50,618 --> 01:42:55,238
I was hired well I was I was hired as

2283
01:42:52,929 --> 01:42:57,158
the guy there to help transplant you

2284
01:42:55,238 --> 01:42:59,919
kept the place from like wandering away

2285
01:42:57,158 --> 01:43:01,359
like the customers from like carrying

2286
01:42:59,920 --> 01:43:03,039
the furniture off and the employees

2287
01:43:01,359 --> 01:43:05,649
showing up on time and not stealing

2288
01:43:03,039 --> 01:43:09,639
everything there were there were a lot

2289
01:43:05,649 --> 01:43:10,689
of chiefs and no Indians like I was

2290
01:43:09,639 --> 01:43:12,279
straight up with the boss was like dude

2291
01:43:10,689 --> 01:43:13,689
you were a great pot grower you're a

2292
01:43:12,279 --> 01:43:15,759
good man you've got a good business but

2293
01:43:13,689 --> 01:43:17,738
honestly you have no idea how to run a

2294
01:43:15,760 --> 01:43:19,000
damn business and he kind of laughed at

2295
01:43:17,738 --> 01:43:20,649
me the way that he did he's a southern

2296
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:22,179
guy and he's real laid-back so he just

2297
01:43:20,649 --> 01:43:24,129
chuckled at me huh you might be right

2298
01:43:22,179 --> 01:43:25,300
about that and he handed me the keys to

2299
01:43:24,130 --> 01:43:28,380
the shop and he said here you have a

2300
01:43:25,300 --> 01:43:28,380
dispensary and see what it's like

2301
01:43:29,109 --> 01:43:34,149
[Music]

2302
01:43:30,689 --> 01:43:37,119
I pretty much had a dispensary we rocked

2303
01:43:34,149 --> 01:43:39,729
that place we did I had days over

2304
01:43:37,119 --> 01:43:41,800
$10,000 in sales and one day I think of

2305
01:43:39,729 --> 01:43:43,809
it as the time I had the best job ever

2306
01:43:41,800 --> 01:43:46,090
that was the wild wild west it was

2307
01:43:43,810 --> 01:43:47,800
wonderful it was it was crazy it was

2308
01:43:46,090 --> 01:43:51,750
definitely the Wild West kids coming in

2309
01:43:47,800 --> 01:43:52,980
with quarter pounds and backpacks and

2310
01:43:51,750 --> 01:43:58,140
[Music]

2311
01:43:52,979 --> 01:43:58,139
edibles at the beginning how they tasted

2312
01:43:59,699 --> 01:44:02,849
[Music]

2313
01:44:11,970 --> 01:44:17,409
at the bud bar so they to be fair we

2314
01:44:15,039 --> 01:44:19,359
usually smoke joints upstairs away from

2315
01:44:17,409 --> 01:44:22,659
the customer services but there was

2316
01:44:19,359 --> 01:44:24,579
plenty of I was reckless and just

2317
01:44:22,659 --> 01:44:26,739
smoking joints because it was the rules

2318
01:44:24,579 --> 01:44:28,090
there were no rules everybody had a

2319
01:44:26,739 --> 01:44:29,710
medical marijuana card we could be

2320
01:44:28,090 --> 01:44:32,409
smoking medical marijuana so there were

2321
01:44:29,710 --> 01:44:34,420
19 things to worry about right so we're

2322
01:44:32,409 --> 01:44:36,039
all in there smoking and customers are

2323
01:44:34,420 --> 01:44:37,510
coming people would show up and be like

2324
01:44:36,039 --> 01:44:39,850
hey do you want to check out this Sour

2325
01:44:37,510 --> 01:44:40,989
Diesel that I grew and be like I sure do

2326
01:44:39,850 --> 01:44:42,370
and then they'd offer it to you I'll

2327
01:44:40,989 --> 01:44:43,840
give it to you for this much a quarter

2328
01:44:42,369 --> 01:44:45,399
pound and I'd be like what do you see

2329
01:44:43,840 --> 01:44:47,409
what we sell it for and eight so you got

2330
01:44:45,399 --> 01:44:48,969
to give me a deal on that and then we'd

2331
01:44:47,409 --> 01:44:50,800
get a good price together and we'd start

2332
01:44:48,970 --> 01:44:54,240
selling that person's quarter pounds NIF

2333
01:44:50,800 --> 01:44:57,439
so the good old days

2334
01:44:54,239 --> 01:44:57,438
[Music]

2335
01:44:58,350 --> 01:45:02,530
every employee had something on this

2336
01:45:00,699 --> 01:45:04,149
shelf that they had arranged and had a

2337
01:45:02,529 --> 01:45:07,149
little profit cut of I remember that I

2338
01:45:04,149 --> 01:45:08,739
was little infused candies yeah I of

2339
01:45:07,149 --> 01:45:10,269
course had herb on the Shelf that I was

2340
01:45:08,739 --> 01:45:14,289
growing a lot of white rhino and cherry

2341
01:45:10,270 --> 01:45:16,930
widows so I would take my quarter pound

2342
01:45:14,289 --> 01:45:19,449
that I grew in my basement and take that

2343
01:45:16,930 --> 01:45:22,090
to work sell it to the boss essentially

2344
01:45:19,449 --> 01:45:25,158
for a specified price and then gonna do

2345
01:45:22,090 --> 01:45:27,539
hourly rate to stand there and say

2346
01:45:25,158 --> 01:45:30,719
it'll sell out sooner so I could bring

2347
01:45:27,539 --> 01:45:32,039
another quarter pound a little more the

2348
01:45:30,719 --> 01:45:34,020
boss would come to you at the end of the

2349
01:45:32,039 --> 01:45:38,488
day it'd be like great job we want more

2350
01:45:34,020 --> 01:45:40,050
of that for you bud yeah one of the

2351
01:45:38,488 --> 01:45:42,959
benefits of having that job was I got to

2352
01:45:40,050 --> 01:45:44,670
see a lot of cannabis and one thing I

2353
01:45:42,960 --> 01:45:46,020
got one day off every week they made

2354
01:45:44,670 --> 01:45:47,460
sure to give me after a while we heard

2355
01:45:46,020 --> 01:45:48,750
more people I got two days off week but

2356
01:45:47,460 --> 01:45:51,448
I had one day off a week and I would

2357
01:45:48,750 --> 01:45:55,050
spend that one day I would drive to

2358
01:45:51,448 --> 01:45:56,729
another city and not be the dispensary

2359
01:45:55,050 --> 01:45:58,500
employee I would go in as a customer to

2360
01:45:56,729 --> 01:46:00,238
his mini shops as I could and just go do

2361
01:45:58,500 --> 01:46:01,679
recon work at all these dispensaries and

2362
01:46:00,238 --> 01:46:03,988
see what they had to offer and see how

2363
01:46:01,679 --> 01:46:05,699
their shops are set up see what who's

2364
01:46:03,988 --> 01:46:08,039
working there see what the bud tenders

2365
01:46:05,698 --> 01:46:09,419
know because I wanted I'm always that

2366
01:46:08,039 --> 01:46:12,329
guy if I'm doing something I want to be

2367
01:46:09,420 --> 01:46:14,279
really good at it the best so I always

2368
01:46:12,329 --> 01:46:15,719
go to see what the best looks like you

2369
01:46:14,279 --> 01:46:17,698
know let's go try to see what I want to

2370
01:46:15,719 --> 01:46:20,670
do and also learn what I do not want to

2371
01:46:17,698 --> 01:46:29,419
do because I saw a lot of ways to do it

2372
01:46:20,670 --> 01:46:31,949
wrong you can smell that musty hay

2373
01:46:29,420 --> 01:46:33,989
improperly cured and dried cannabis

2374
01:46:31,948 --> 01:46:36,299
smell in the waiting room right and

2375
01:46:33,988 --> 01:46:38,098
you're like I just want to leave I can

2376
01:46:36,300 --> 01:46:41,279
already tell that this is gonna be be

2377
01:46:38,099 --> 01:46:43,289
great product right I got my feet wet of

2378
01:46:41,279 --> 01:46:49,170
growing commercial cannabis in one of

2379
01:46:43,289 --> 01:46:51,510
those places so how how challenging is

2380
01:46:49,170 --> 01:46:54,090
it to go from being an outdoor grower to

2381
01:46:51,510 --> 01:46:56,369
being like you're a caregiver you're an

2382
01:46:54,090 --> 01:46:58,139
indoor but they call us basement growers

2383
01:46:56,368 --> 01:47:00,269
is what we're labeled as but you know

2384
01:46:58,139 --> 01:47:03,730
that's a derogatory term it kind of is

2385
01:47:00,270 --> 01:47:06,040
but if you've got the right basement

2386
01:47:03,729 --> 01:47:08,259
it's not that you can't be a really

2387
01:47:06,039 --> 01:47:14,590
awesome sexy basement grower it's that

2388
01:47:08,260 --> 01:47:17,079
it's sort of like private caregivers how

2389
01:47:14,590 --> 01:47:19,239
was your power changes going from being

2390
01:47:17,079 --> 01:47:24,029
a caregiver in a residential growth to

2391
01:47:19,239 --> 01:47:26,920
having a gigantic commercial growth I

2392
01:47:24,029 --> 01:47:28,630
always say it's you're on a commercial

2393
01:47:26,920 --> 01:47:34,779
grow you're not growing weed you're

2394
01:47:28,630 --> 01:47:37,000
managing a schedule it's more of a plant

2395
01:47:34,779 --> 01:47:38,319
management no fund intended but you know

2396
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:40,449
you're trying to keep all the wheels

2397
01:47:38,319 --> 01:47:44,619
greased and rolling and functioning

2398
01:47:40,449 --> 01:47:47,679
properly and if you started to a grow

2399
01:47:44,619 --> 01:47:51,010
that didn't have that mindset to begin

2400
01:47:47,680 --> 01:47:52,240
with it's quite disastrous so you had to

2401
01:47:51,010 --> 01:47:54,340
come in and kind of take over for

2402
01:47:52,239 --> 01:47:57,909
somebody else I had to learn that from

2403
01:47:54,340 --> 01:48:00,310
you know I I have no card laying the

2404
01:47:57,909 --> 01:48:01,510
middle of it off yeah yeah exactly trial

2405
01:48:00,310 --> 01:48:05,200
by fire yeah

2406
01:48:01,510 --> 01:48:08,289
sink or swim because the shop that you

2407
01:48:05,199 --> 01:48:10,779
were thrown into they did not provide

2408
01:48:08,289 --> 01:48:24,220
the proper equipment supplies no

2409
01:48:10,779 --> 01:48:27,969
actually there was just as beneficial as

2410
01:48:24,220 --> 01:48:30,490
learning what to do sometimes it helps

2411
01:48:27,970 --> 01:48:32,110
to figure out why you do it that way by

2412
01:48:30,489 --> 01:48:34,149
seeing how what happens when it's done

2413
01:48:32,109 --> 01:48:35,649
wrong yeah some people can only learn

2414
01:48:34,149 --> 01:48:38,649
that way I've worked for a few of those

2415
01:48:35,649 --> 01:48:41,829
people just stand back and let it crash

2416
01:48:38,649 --> 01:48:43,509
I made a completely amateur mistake I've

2417
01:48:41,829 --> 01:48:45,609
got a gorilla glue plant and it's

2418
01:48:43,510 --> 01:48:47,650
growing out of control so I'm sort of

2419
01:48:45,609 --> 01:48:48,969
its kind of mainlining but not really

2420
01:48:47,649 --> 01:48:50,559
because I'm not cleaning everything off

2421
01:48:48,970 --> 01:48:52,240
I'm just trying to pull it down I split

2422
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:55,110
that [ __ ] right down the middle trying

2423
01:48:52,239 --> 01:48:57,309
to pull one side too far from the other

2424
01:48:55,109 --> 01:49:07,449
one piece of duct tape and a twisty tie

2425
01:48:57,310 --> 01:49:09,130
it was all happy quick first dates she's

2426
01:49:07,449 --> 01:49:10,899
cool she's happy four or five days later

2427
01:49:09,130 --> 01:49:12,500
she's happier she looks stronger there

2428
01:49:10,899 --> 01:49:14,359
than she did before

2429
01:49:12,500 --> 01:49:18,439
so yeah they're Hardy made a super noob

2430
01:49:14,359 --> 01:49:25,279
mistake I was just gonna say there's a

2431
01:49:18,439 --> 01:49:28,009
reason they called it weed through I've

2432
01:49:25,279 --> 01:49:32,420
been dead shops from Pueblo Colorado

2433
01:49:28,010 --> 01:49:34,460
Springs Denver east and west of Denver

2434
01:49:32,420 --> 01:49:36,020
both directions I haven't gotten up to

2435
01:49:34,460 --> 01:49:38,329
Boulder Fort Collins to the dispensaries

2436
01:49:36,020 --> 01:49:41,240
but it seems like I have but you know

2437
01:49:38,329 --> 01:49:43,359
shops in Fort Collins I was up a couple

2438
01:49:41,239 --> 01:49:49,340
in Fort Collins before they got killed

2439
01:49:43,359 --> 01:49:51,679
along battle days again but they were

2440
01:49:49,340 --> 01:49:54,319
about like you'd see everywhere there

2441
01:49:51,680 --> 01:49:56,210
are good and bad examples and the good

2442
01:49:54,319 --> 01:49:59,210
examples range the spectrum from very

2443
01:49:56,210 --> 01:50:02,300
culture eat a very medical office II and

2444
01:49:59,210 --> 01:50:03,560
sort of the bad ones but these a lot of

2445
01:50:02,300 --> 01:50:05,630
both do you think that the huge

2446
01:50:03,560 --> 01:50:10,400
regulation has changed the quality and

2447
01:50:05,630 --> 01:50:14,810
product yes no I think it hurt and

2448
01:50:10,399 --> 01:50:17,359
helped it become a lot of the incredible

2449
01:50:14,810 --> 01:50:20,360
growers couldn't handle the regulation

2450
01:50:17,359 --> 01:50:23,679
when it first came down and then quality

2451
01:50:20,359 --> 01:50:26,149
dropped and it stayed kind of down I

2452
01:50:23,680 --> 01:50:28,850
don't want it to you know bash it too

2453
01:50:26,149 --> 01:50:30,710
bad but quality dip for a while when the

2454
01:50:28,850 --> 01:50:32,120
best growers were all forced out of the

2455
01:50:30,710 --> 01:50:35,210
legal industry and it took a while for

2456
01:50:32,119 --> 01:50:37,189
the people who were great at business

2457
01:50:35,210 --> 01:50:39,380
and great at following regulations to

2458
01:50:37,189 --> 01:50:41,500
catch up with making a great product

2459
01:50:39,380 --> 01:50:43,819
[Music]

2460
01:50:41,500 --> 01:50:46,489
there were industry leaders for a while

2461
01:50:43,819 --> 01:50:50,389
and I think now solid product is more

2462
01:50:46,489 --> 01:50:52,279
common than shady product but then again

2463
01:50:50,390 --> 01:50:53,780
I'm not up at the shops as often as I'd

2464
01:50:52,279 --> 01:50:55,909
like to be to say this [ __ ] with more

2465
01:50:53,779 --> 01:50:57,289
confidence right one of the things that

2466
01:50:55,909 --> 01:50:59,949
kind of annoys me we made all these

2467
01:50:57,289 --> 01:51:03,229
regulations to prevent shitty weed

2468
01:50:59,949 --> 01:51:04,880
pesticides mildew problems guess what

2469
01:51:03,229 --> 01:51:06,829
we're still getting it they have it they

2470
01:51:04,880 --> 01:51:08,420
don't go inspect the butter at all they

2471
01:51:06,829 --> 01:51:09,890
just pay attention to the dollars and

2472
01:51:08,420 --> 01:51:11,420
the sales and it'll care about the

2473
01:51:09,890 --> 01:51:12,650
products or the safety they check on the

2474
01:51:11,420 --> 01:51:15,680
edibles and make sure the edibles are

2475
01:51:12,649 --> 01:51:19,549
the proper dosage they don't really care

2476
01:51:15,680 --> 01:51:23,000
there isn't a regulatory system for

2477
01:51:19,550 --> 01:51:24,409
safety inspections for smokable as other

2478
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:26,198
than through tobacco and

2479
01:51:24,408 --> 01:51:29,328
didn't really have that infrastructure

2480
01:51:26,198 --> 01:51:30,859
with the foodstuff kitchen safety and

2481
01:51:29,328 --> 01:51:32,658
all of those rules are already in place

2482
01:51:30,859 --> 01:51:35,929
and we saw what happened when those

2483
01:51:32,658 --> 01:51:40,728
first inspections came out everybody at

2484
01:51:35,929 --> 01:51:44,418
the table kind of smiled and just

2485
01:51:40,729 --> 01:51:45,949
recently started enforcing these over

2486
01:51:44,418 --> 01:51:49,309
the weekend and it's good to see him

2487
01:51:45,948 --> 01:51:51,109
smiling his lake is awesome what's up AJ

2488
01:51:49,309 --> 01:51:53,300
good to see hope you listen to the show

2489
01:51:51,109 --> 01:51:55,009
AJ Cashman shut up over a hundred people

2490
01:51:53,300 --> 01:51:59,119
got dinged and it's not like they were

2491
01:51:55,010 --> 01:52:02,119
doing anything that bad or that wrong it

2492
01:51:59,118 --> 01:52:05,058
was just their first taste of what the

2493
01:52:02,118 --> 01:52:07,188
high-end food quality regulations really

2494
01:52:05,059 --> 01:52:09,409
looked like in a medical edible

2495
01:52:07,189 --> 01:52:11,719
production kitchen like even Dixie got

2496
01:52:09,408 --> 01:52:16,518
hit and they're the ones that are like

2497
01:52:11,719 --> 01:52:18,828
the shining example in the industry as

2498
01:52:16,519 --> 01:52:20,418
the regulations come down the people

2499
01:52:18,828 --> 01:52:22,308
that were great at following them have

2500
01:52:20,418 --> 01:52:25,069
to step up and figure out how to be

2501
01:52:22,309 --> 01:52:27,139
great at growing weed too because they

2502
01:52:25,069 --> 01:52:29,268
haven't been practicing for 20 years

2503
01:52:27,139 --> 01:52:30,708
because they were terrified of breaking

2504
01:52:29,269 --> 01:52:33,458
the rules that's why they're good at

2505
01:52:30,708 --> 01:52:33,458
following them now

2506
01:52:34,760 --> 01:52:38,510
that's why you can't find my product on

2507
01:52:36,619 --> 01:52:39,738
the shelf because they changed all those

2508
01:52:38,510 --> 01:52:41,090
rules yeah I think when it was all the

2509
01:52:39,738 --> 01:52:43,209
basement growers and the care givers

2510
01:52:41,090 --> 01:52:45,890
doing it in the basement

2511
01:52:43,210 --> 01:52:47,600
yeah because while the cameras all the

2512
01:52:45,890 --> 01:52:51,260
regulations all that stuff is super

2513
01:52:47,600 --> 01:52:53,630
expensive but the big expense to start

2514
01:52:51,260 --> 01:52:55,579
off is the property like unless you can

2515
01:52:53,630 --> 01:52:57,560
find a landlord willing to give Uncle

2516
01:52:55,579 --> 01:53:00,769
Sam his property to let you live your

2517
01:52:57,560 --> 01:53:03,170
dream which thanks dad other than that

2518
01:53:00,770 --> 01:53:04,610
you ain't finding it so you gotta buy

2519
01:53:03,170 --> 01:53:06,230
the property yourself and unless you've

2520
01:53:04,609 --> 01:53:10,159
got a million dollars you're not owning

2521
01:53:06,229 --> 01:53:13,399
a retail property in Colorado sir other

2522
01:53:10,159 --> 01:53:16,930
people live anyway well I know several

2523
01:53:13,399 --> 01:53:16,929
people that are on the look for property

2524
01:53:17,829 --> 01:53:23,569
from a grower standpoint to most

2525
01:53:21,050 --> 01:53:26,060
business or most dispensary owners earn

2526
01:53:23,569 --> 01:53:29,179
more at this day and age they're more of

2527
01:53:26,060 --> 01:53:32,000
a business minded person and like he

2528
01:53:29,180 --> 01:53:33,770
said know nothing about growing and they

2529
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:36,199
can be incredibly hard to work with from

2530
01:53:33,770 --> 01:53:38,720
a growers point of view I wish I would

2531
01:53:36,199 --> 01:53:40,250
have learned the business school instead

2532
01:53:38,720 --> 01:53:42,710
of learning to be a super good pot

2533
01:53:40,250 --> 01:53:46,279
grower I went to business school these

2534
01:53:42,710 --> 01:53:49,789
regulations are confusing [ __ ] it ain't

2535
01:53:46,279 --> 01:53:51,500
the lack of schooling you're better a

2536
01:53:49,789 --> 01:53:53,269
business than most of the people that I

2537
01:53:51,500 --> 01:53:55,550
went to do you Business School with and

2538
01:53:53,270 --> 01:53:58,160
you dropped out of society and went on

2539
01:53:55,550 --> 01:54:00,050
tour while they went to college like it

2540
01:53:58,159 --> 01:54:01,250
doesn't have a lot to do with how well

2541
01:54:00,050 --> 01:54:02,810
you did in business school

2542
01:54:01,250 --> 01:54:05,659
I think the life experience was

2543
01:54:02,810 --> 01:54:08,420
priceless right now following the

2544
01:54:05,659 --> 01:54:11,840
regulations is really a question of are

2545
01:54:08,420 --> 01:54:13,460
you willing to pay your lawyer gotta

2546
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:15,050
have that capital to have that lawyer

2547
01:54:13,460 --> 01:54:19,130
because the way lawyers are ridiculous

2548
01:54:15,050 --> 01:54:20,539
right now from my perception I'm kind of

2549
01:54:19,130 --> 01:54:22,789
from the outside cuz I really don't do a

2550
01:54:20,539 --> 01:54:25,519
lot of shop shopping or not as much as

2551
01:54:22,789 --> 01:54:29,180
I'd like but the really successful shops

2552
01:54:25,520 --> 01:54:31,670
that have a handful of locations a

2553
01:54:29,180 --> 01:54:35,119
reputation for amazing consistent

2554
01:54:31,670 --> 01:54:38,329
product are the ones that really invest

2555
01:54:35,119 --> 01:54:38,929
it in a good grower and setting up a

2556
01:54:38,329 --> 01:54:42,920
grow

2557
01:54:38,929 --> 01:54:48,739
that grower can really run and paid the

2558
01:54:42,920 --> 01:54:50,989
[ __ ] out of that lawyer and there's so

2559
01:54:48,738 --> 01:54:53,058
many shops died because the grower and

2560
01:54:50,988 --> 01:54:55,308
the business people got in a pissing

2561
01:54:53,059 --> 01:54:57,650
contest then rather than succeed they

2562
01:54:55,309 --> 01:54:59,059
just peed on each other a bunch one of

2563
01:54:57,649 --> 01:55:01,488
the most popular dispensaries in the

2564
01:54:59,059 --> 01:55:03,498
state does not have their super popular

2565
01:55:01,488 --> 01:55:05,118
grower and grow team anymore because of

2566
01:55:03,498 --> 01:55:11,538
recent political changes they chose to

2567
01:55:05,118 --> 01:55:13,248
make I was kind of sad to see that but

2568
01:55:11,538 --> 01:55:26,208
it did make for some great new

2569
01:55:13,248 --> 01:55:27,618
opportunities upwards yeah fix it okay

2570
01:55:26,208 --> 01:55:30,738
it's cuz I got here my turned up real

2571
01:55:27,618 --> 01:55:31,998
hot cool learnin how to work sound

2572
01:55:30,738 --> 01:55:37,308
equipment only took me thirty four

2573
01:55:31,998 --> 01:55:38,840
episodes so the reason that Mike

2574
01:55:37,309 --> 01:55:41,029
actually Mike and Jesse have been

2575
01:55:38,840 --> 01:55:43,550
contacting me talking to me about this

2576
01:55:41,029 --> 01:55:45,498
topic this I was sleeping on this mic

2577
01:55:43,550 --> 01:55:46,519
thankfully is a super active member of

2578
01:55:45,498 --> 01:55:48,469
our community

2579
01:55:46,519 --> 01:55:50,050
he goes to City Council meetings he

2580
01:55:48,469 --> 01:55:52,998
supports cannabis any way that he can

2581
01:55:50,050 --> 01:55:55,369
jesse works at a hydro shop and try and

2582
01:55:52,998 --> 01:55:59,019
is also a farmer a grower and tries to

2583
01:55:55,368 --> 01:56:01,368
do what he can to stay up on politics I

2584
01:55:59,019 --> 01:56:02,479
don't pay attention to the local news to

2585
01:56:01,368 --> 01:56:04,188
tell you the truth I just pay attention

2586
01:56:02,479 --> 01:56:06,139
to the world international cannabis news

2587
01:56:04,189 --> 01:56:07,760
and the state news so luckily Mike

2588
01:56:06,139 --> 01:56:09,260
brought this to my attention and Jesse

2589
01:56:07,760 --> 01:56:10,639
had some stuff to add to it I put these

2590
01:56:09,260 --> 01:56:12,320
guys in touch and then they were like we

2591
01:56:10,639 --> 01:56:13,819
got to get on the podcast tonight so

2592
01:56:12,319 --> 01:56:15,319
their idea to do a show about this so

2593
01:56:13,819 --> 01:56:17,988
big shout out to these guys thank you

2594
01:56:15,319 --> 01:56:23,779
guys were giving me material thank you

2595
01:56:17,988 --> 01:56:25,669
Mike took some notes and I've got a

2596
01:56:23,779 --> 01:56:29,630
little opening an opening statement if

2597
01:56:25,670 --> 01:56:30,109
you will it says again without a frog in

2598
01:56:29,630 --> 01:56:31,969
my throat

2599
01:56:30,109 --> 01:56:33,978
it says city staff is attempting to

2600
01:56:31,969 --> 01:56:35,689
draft the new ordinance that would ban

2601
01:56:33,979 --> 01:56:37,670
all indoor growing in the city of Puebla

2602
01:56:35,689 --> 01:56:39,709
they want to make the rules that say

2603
01:56:37,670 --> 01:56:41,269
they want to make rules that say we have

2604
01:56:39,708 --> 01:56:43,158
to grow in a separate building detached

2605
01:56:41,269 --> 01:56:45,320
from our house and that is [ __ ]

2606
01:56:43,158 --> 01:56:48,019
because of many reasons

2607
01:56:45,319 --> 01:56:49,069
pretty accurate what I wrote there yeah

2608
01:56:48,020 --> 01:56:52,580
cool

2609
01:56:49,069 --> 01:56:55,819
not just indoor home growing though all

2610
01:56:52,579 --> 01:56:58,100
home growing so green Oh green house in

2611
01:56:55,819 --> 01:57:01,880
your backyard no just out in your

2612
01:56:58,100 --> 01:57:05,570
backyard no in your basement no in your

2613
01:57:01,880 --> 01:57:07,550
bedroom no little grow cabinet which

2614
01:57:05,569 --> 01:57:10,819
means everything at your local hydro

2615
01:57:07,550 --> 01:57:13,100
store is pretty much pointless because

2616
01:57:10,819 --> 01:57:17,269
you can't use any of it unless you build

2617
01:57:13,100 --> 01:57:20,060
a special outbuilding just for your six

2618
01:57:17,270 --> 01:57:22,010
personal cannabis plants which is

2619
01:57:20,060 --> 01:57:24,080
ridiculous how many of us can afford to

2620
01:57:22,010 --> 01:57:29,480
build a special outbuilding just for our

2621
01:57:24,079 --> 01:57:32,630
cannabis chieftain the last couple of

2622
01:57:29,479 --> 01:57:34,279
weeks has been revolving around most

2623
01:57:32,630 --> 01:57:35,869
people in this will not most people in a

2624
01:57:34,279 --> 01:57:38,229
city several people in the city not

2625
01:57:35,869 --> 01:57:40,460
being able afford trash service

2626
01:57:38,229 --> 01:57:42,259
electricity payments things like this

2627
01:57:40,460 --> 01:57:46,369
and we're talking about having people

2628
01:57:42,260 --> 01:57:50,150
build a special airtight smell proof

2629
01:57:46,369 --> 01:57:52,130
building so they can grow six pot plants

2630
01:57:50,149 --> 01:57:54,069
well technically three because you're

2631
01:57:52,130 --> 01:57:56,510
only allowed three in bloom at one time

2632
01:57:54,069 --> 01:57:58,279
so you'd only have three stinky

2633
01:57:56,510 --> 01:58:00,050
flowering plants in that building ever

2634
01:57:58,279 --> 01:58:03,259
at once this would also affect

2635
01:58:00,050 --> 01:58:04,430
caregivers he's using a 64 as a

2636
01:58:03,260 --> 01:58:09,130
reference but it would also affect

2637
01:58:04,430 --> 01:58:09,130
caregivers thank you so it would just

2638
01:58:11,949 --> 01:58:16,340
make it easier to steal harder to take

2639
01:58:14,659 --> 01:58:17,449
care of it's gonna be another building

2640
01:58:16,340 --> 01:58:18,050
you're gonna have to get a building

2641
01:58:17,449 --> 01:58:20,439
permit

2642
01:58:18,050 --> 01:58:22,460
you're gonna need to wire that building

2643
01:58:20,439 --> 01:58:24,949
everybody in the neighborhood would know

2644
01:58:22,460 --> 01:58:26,329
that that's why he has six people on the

2645
01:58:24,949 --> 01:58:27,859
block or in the neighborhood or whatever

2646
01:58:26,329 --> 01:58:29,720
just built that special new building

2647
01:58:27,859 --> 01:58:33,649
behind their house you'd have to only

2648
01:58:29,720 --> 01:58:35,510
said property it's the first place my

2649
01:58:33,649 --> 01:58:37,579
mind went is it's a huge kick to Black

2650
01:58:35,510 --> 01:58:40,550
Hills because everybody who's been using

2651
01:58:37,579 --> 01:58:42,649
a green house or following the very

2652
01:58:40,550 --> 01:58:45,289
letter of the law and just chain linking

2653
01:58:42,649 --> 01:58:47,000
their plants into a cage and essentially

2654
01:58:45,289 --> 01:58:50,619
growing them purely outdoors in their

2655
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:52,529
backyard but in an enclosed lock space

2656
01:58:50,619 --> 01:58:55,689
now you've got to put them under

2657
01:58:52,529 --> 01:58:58,149
expensive grow lights with its fancy you

2658
01:58:55,689 --> 01:59:00,009
know air filtration equipment and all of

2659
01:58:58,149 --> 01:59:02,379
that is just a huge give the Black Hills

2660
01:59:00,010 --> 01:59:05,739
that you said that you had an idea of

2661
01:59:02,380 --> 01:59:08,739
why this ordinance was being drafted so

2662
01:59:05,739 --> 01:59:11,529
a couple weeks ago and I'm the City

2663
01:59:08,739 --> 01:59:15,579
Council policy nerd I go attend just

2664
01:59:11,529 --> 01:59:17,859
about every meeting I was there two

2665
01:59:15,579 --> 01:59:20,350
weeks ago listening to the interviews

2666
01:59:17,859 --> 01:59:22,539
for the new city council seat and then

2667
01:59:20,350 --> 01:59:25,600
for the budgetary meeting they had after

2668
01:59:22,539 --> 01:59:27,550
that and during the budgetary meeting

2669
01:59:25,600 --> 01:59:29,800
just sort of offhandedly a couple of the

2670
01:59:27,550 --> 01:59:31,570
council members referenced a complaint

2671
01:59:29,800 --> 01:59:34,989
they had all received to the previous

2672
01:59:31,569 --> 01:59:37,210
week from a homeowner on the south side

2673
01:59:34,989 --> 01:59:39,279
who's an elderly gentleman and wakes up

2674
01:59:37,210 --> 01:59:42,189
every day to the stink of marijuana

2675
01:59:39,279 --> 01:59:43,719
plants and now everybody's sitting at

2676
01:59:42,189 --> 01:59:45,699
this table is like you asked why'd you

2677
01:59:43,720 --> 01:59:47,710
say stink well it's because that's how

2678
01:59:45,699 --> 01:59:50,349
this old guy sees it that's how what he

2679
01:59:47,710 --> 01:59:54,340
called City Council about in being City

2680
01:59:50,350 --> 01:59:56,710
Council and not having a whole lot to do

2681
01:59:54,340 --> 01:59:59,140
other than please your constituents and

2682
01:59:56,710 --> 02:00:01,029
you know respond to stuff like this a

2683
01:59:59,140 --> 02:00:07,390
number of them drove out to this guy's

2684
02:00:01,029 --> 02:00:09,969
house and gave it a smell sandy Daffy

2685
02:00:07,390 --> 02:00:11,350
said it was very strong from the

2686
02:00:09,970 --> 02:00:13,300
driveway she pulled up into this

2687
02:00:11,350 --> 02:00:14,980
gentleman's house so next she pulls up

2688
02:00:13,300 --> 02:00:18,909
next door and she can smell this guy's

2689
02:00:14,979 --> 02:00:20,739
garden he said that he didn't really

2690
02:00:18,909 --> 02:00:22,359
smell it but when he was standing in the

2691
02:00:20,739 --> 02:00:24,239
backyard he could clearly see several

2692
02:00:22,359 --> 02:00:26,769
plants over the top of a privacy fence

2693
02:00:24,239 --> 02:00:28,679
so you know gives you an idea how big

2694
02:00:26,770 --> 02:00:31,330
this caregiver was doing in his backyard

2695
02:00:28,680 --> 02:00:33,430
it doesn't sound like he's meeting all

2696
02:00:31,329 --> 02:00:35,260
of the basic city code stuff because

2697
02:00:33,430 --> 02:00:38,470
they weren't enclosed or locked

2698
02:00:35,260 --> 02:00:40,090
they were just in his backyard but the

2699
02:00:38,470 --> 02:00:42,730
cops have been out at this guy's house

2700
02:00:40,090 --> 02:00:44,289
his neighbors are pissed like what any

2701
02:00:42,729 --> 02:00:49,269
of you ever sneak out your neighbors

2702
02:00:44,289 --> 02:00:50,979
like this it's a pretty easy way to

2703
02:00:49,270 --> 02:00:52,750
bring problems on yourself like it's I

2704
02:00:50,979 --> 02:00:54,339
would be embarrassed if my neighbors

2705
02:00:52,750 --> 02:00:56,050
smelled me every morning there's an

2706
02:00:54,340 --> 02:00:57,640
indoor grower I try to be really covert

2707
02:00:56,050 --> 02:00:59,020
my neighbors I'm certain my neighbors

2708
02:00:57,640 --> 02:01:01,030
know what I do because they've seen me

2709
02:00:59,020 --> 02:01:02,570
carrying things they see my dreadlocks

2710
02:01:01,029 --> 02:01:04,340
they know who I am

2711
02:01:02,569 --> 02:01:06,009
they've seen my facebook they probably

2712
02:01:04,340 --> 02:01:08,659
listen to the podcast

2713
02:01:06,010 --> 02:01:10,340
one of my neighbors was a vendor I don't

2714
02:01:08,659 --> 02:01:13,969
know what he sold exactly but he brought

2715
02:01:10,340 --> 02:01:15,560
me a large box of lighters fresh

2716
02:01:13,969 --> 02:01:16,880
lighters like just he's like this I'm

2717
02:01:15,560 --> 02:01:19,070
pretty sure you guys smoke you want some

2718
02:01:16,880 --> 02:01:23,779
lighters and that big gigantic box over

2719
02:01:19,069 --> 02:01:28,579
there is that's all lighters but I still

2720
02:01:23,779 --> 02:01:30,409
I don't city council on you saying

2721
02:01:28,579 --> 02:01:32,449
you're a bad neighbor because they don't

2722
02:01:30,409 --> 02:01:33,619
wake ups like I would be mortified like

2723
02:01:32,449 --> 02:01:35,569
clearly my mother did not raise

2724
02:01:33,619 --> 02:01:39,140
whoever's growing these pot plants but

2725
02:01:35,569 --> 02:01:40,130
you know so city council went out there

2726
02:01:39,140 --> 02:01:42,230
and during the meeting the other night

2727
02:01:40,130 --> 02:01:44,359
they mentioned sort of offhandedly that

2728
02:01:42,229 --> 02:01:46,609
they had all received this complaint and

2729
02:01:44,359 --> 02:01:48,319
they all agreed that this guy should be

2730
02:01:46,609 --> 02:01:51,439
able to wake up in the morning and not

2731
02:01:48,319 --> 02:01:52,849
smell his neighbor's pot plants and they

2732
02:01:51,439 --> 02:01:54,409
didn't really say anything else about it

2733
02:01:52,850 --> 02:01:56,930
they kind of chuckled about the smell

2734
02:01:54,409 --> 02:01:59,420
and the contact how I got thrown around

2735
02:01:56,930 --> 02:02:01,159
a little bit they were busy they were

2736
02:01:59,420 --> 02:02:03,440
going over budgetary stuff in the cities

2737
02:02:01,159 --> 02:02:07,609
millions of dollars in the hole so he

2738
02:02:03,439 --> 02:02:09,589
got dropped pretty quick and you being

2739
02:02:07,609 --> 02:02:11,509
Who I am and doing what I do all day

2740
02:02:09,590 --> 02:02:15,710
when I read the article in the chieftain

2741
02:02:11,510 --> 02:02:18,619
today I called every city council member

2742
02:02:15,710 --> 02:02:21,199
in Pablo and three of them called me

2743
02:02:18,619 --> 02:02:22,849
back today and discussed this issue and

2744
02:02:21,199 --> 02:02:25,519
all of them said that this isn't

2745
02:02:22,850 --> 02:02:27,230
something that they asked for or that

2746
02:02:25,520 --> 02:02:30,170
they're aware that any other council

2747
02:02:27,229 --> 02:02:33,049
person asked for rather it's something

2748
02:02:30,170 --> 02:02:36,859
the city staff has put together based on

2749
02:02:33,050 --> 02:02:38,960
those offhanded comments the council

2750
02:02:36,859 --> 02:02:41,000
meeting the other night so this is all

2751
02:02:38,960 --> 02:02:43,189
the brainchild of somebody in Planning

2752
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:47,090
and Zoning who's attempting to please

2753
02:02:43,189 --> 02:02:49,819
his bosses who might not or whom he

2754
02:02:47,090 --> 02:02:53,180
decided might want to weed can't smell

2755
02:02:49,819 --> 02:02:55,069
weed in pueblo type ordinance the City

2756
02:02:53,180 --> 02:02:58,070
Council people I talked to all use the

2757
02:02:55,069 --> 02:03:00,559
word unenforceable or all agreed to any

2758
02:02:58,069 --> 02:03:02,809
sort of ordinance that covered growing

2759
02:03:00,560 --> 02:03:04,730
pot in a basement or in a garage like

2760
02:03:02,810 --> 02:03:06,410
all of that is unenforceable they can't

2761
02:03:04,729 --> 02:03:08,899
send somebody to every house in Pueblo

2762
02:03:06,409 --> 02:03:10,488
in check so essentially if you're not

2763
02:03:08,899 --> 02:03:13,250
being a jerk and stinking up your

2764
02:03:10,488 --> 02:03:14,099
neighbor to begin with there'd be no way

2765
02:03:13,250 --> 02:03:15,720
for them to find

2766
02:03:14,100 --> 02:03:18,240
you making this totally pointless so I

2767
02:03:15,720 --> 02:03:21,060
don't see it really going anywhere but

2768
02:03:18,239 --> 02:03:23,760
regardless everybody who gives a [ __ ]

2769
02:03:21,060 --> 02:03:26,430
needs to show up on the 13th at 7:00

2770
02:03:23,760 --> 02:03:30,329
p.m. at the City Council building down

2771
02:03:26,430 --> 02:03:31,409
on Union and grand you're the City

2772
02:03:30,329 --> 02:03:33,090
Council guy you should be telling me

2773
02:03:31,409 --> 02:03:35,010
don't look at me with a question I Drive

2774
02:03:33,090 --> 02:03:38,000
I Drive there without thinking at this

2775
02:03:35,010 --> 02:03:41,610
point I will tweet the correct address

2776
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:43,140
guys we want to go on October 13th to

2777
02:03:41,609 --> 02:03:45,779
City Council and tell them that this

2778
02:03:43,140 --> 02:03:47,850
proposed idea is unacceptable and it

2779
02:03:45,779 --> 02:03:49,019
will not work for us great while you

2780
02:03:47,850 --> 02:03:52,079
were talking I came up with an

2781
02:03:49,020 --> 02:03:53,790
alternative a cannabis courtesy law it's

2782
02:03:52,079 --> 02:03:55,559
like a Don't Ask Don't Tell but if we

2783
02:03:53,789 --> 02:03:59,609
can smell it you got to turn it down

2784
02:03:55,560 --> 02:04:01,800
that's a cannabis courtesy good I'd like

2785
02:03:59,609 --> 02:04:03,089
to see more of a public service

2786
02:04:01,800 --> 02:04:09,989
announcement that's like don't be a

2787
02:04:03,090 --> 02:04:12,329
[ __ ] [ __ ] it's it's a common

2788
02:04:09,989 --> 02:04:13,590
courtesy I would be mortified as the

2789
02:04:12,329 --> 02:04:15,059
word I would use to describe and not

2790
02:04:13,590 --> 02:04:16,770
embarrassed not ashamed [ __ ]

2791
02:04:15,060 --> 02:04:18,870
mortified if my neighbor smelled me

2792
02:04:16,770 --> 02:04:21,290
every morning yeah and if you're growing

2793
02:04:18,869 --> 02:04:23,909
30 or 40 cannabis plants as a caregiver

2794
02:04:21,289 --> 02:04:25,800
you're putting yourself at risk your

2795
02:04:23,909 --> 02:04:29,579
patients medicine at risk just having

2796
02:04:25,800 --> 02:04:31,020
that wafting down the alley like we

2797
02:04:29,579 --> 02:04:32,399
already had one kid gets shot in the

2798
02:04:31,020 --> 02:04:34,020
stomach with an air rifle this summer

2799
02:04:32,399 --> 02:04:37,259
because someone's too stupid they'll put

2800
02:04:34,020 --> 02:04:38,850
their [ __ ] in a fence throw a chain-link

2801
02:04:37,260 --> 02:04:40,680
fence over it teenagers aren't gonna

2802
02:04:38,850 --> 02:04:42,780
bother they can barely work scissors a

2803
02:04:40,680 --> 02:04:44,430
long freakin wire cutters most of them

2804
02:04:42,779 --> 02:04:45,599
are so lazy that they're not ready to

2805
02:04:44,430 --> 02:04:48,030
steal unless it's right in their face

2806
02:04:45,600 --> 02:04:50,880
anyway right if you're growing in town

2807
02:04:48,029 --> 02:04:52,769
don't don't push the limits you know I

2808
02:04:50,880 --> 02:04:56,670
think that's the thing we're getting it

2809
02:04:52,770 --> 02:04:59,400
but all this is because one guys being

2810
02:04:56,670 --> 02:05:00,810
inconsiderate yes yes we're all gonna

2811
02:04:59,399 --> 02:05:03,059
get punished for that that kind of sucks

2812
02:05:00,810 --> 02:05:04,500
everybody who would like to grow their

2813
02:05:03,060 --> 02:05:06,720
own cannabis plants in the city of

2814
02:05:04,500 --> 02:05:10,260
Pueblo now has that right in jeopardy

2815
02:05:06,720 --> 02:05:12,000
because one jerk on the south side is

2816
02:05:10,260 --> 02:05:13,260
stinking up his neighbor's house but two

2817
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,489
jerks because somebody had to shoot

2818
02:05:13,260 --> 02:05:17,159
somebody also and I'm sure that

2819
02:05:14,489 --> 02:05:17,939
contributes that's surely not helping

2820
02:05:17,159 --> 02:05:23,039
anybody

2821
02:05:17,939 --> 02:05:24,659
and there's another jerk out in County I

2822
02:05:23,039 --> 02:05:29,550
almost said too much of the neighborhood

2823
02:05:24,659 --> 02:05:31,409
but he's the the main thing for the

2824
02:05:29,550 --> 02:05:32,850
county kind of doing the same thing that

2825
02:05:31,409 --> 02:05:34,710
they're wanting to do the same thing

2826
02:05:32,850 --> 02:05:36,510
that the city's gonna do or try to do

2827
02:05:34,710 --> 02:05:38,939
the county's talking about proposed

2828
02:05:36,510 --> 02:05:43,590
plant limits as ever they are talking

2829
02:05:38,939 --> 02:05:49,710
limits but regardless of caregiver ship

2830
02:05:43,590 --> 02:05:53,220
or anything like that it would be 18

2831
02:05:49,710 --> 02:05:56,390
plants yeah 18 plants per single-family

2832
02:05:53,220 --> 02:06:01,710
residence and 12 plants per apartment or

2833
02:05:56,390 --> 02:06:05,190
multifamily residence and it limits or

2834
02:06:01,710 --> 02:06:06,899
forbids outdoor going to so that's you

2835
02:06:05,189 --> 02:06:09,089
know let's ridiculous especially in the

2836
02:06:06,899 --> 02:06:12,629
county the forbidding of outdoor growing

2837
02:06:09,090 --> 02:06:16,680
is just a silly gift to Black Hills that

2838
02:06:12,630 --> 02:06:19,289
they don't deserve the Sun is free

2839
02:06:16,680 --> 02:06:21,180
abundant energy and plants are meant to

2840
02:06:19,289 --> 02:06:23,279
be outdoors and the only reason

2841
02:06:21,180 --> 02:06:30,030
marijuana was forced indoors to begin

2842
02:06:23,279 --> 02:06:31,469
with was prohibition yeah ridiculous

2843
02:06:30,029 --> 02:06:33,090
[ __ ] but that thing you just said about

2844
02:06:31,470 --> 02:06:34,650
the only reason marijuana was forced

2845
02:06:33,090 --> 02:06:35,760
indoors was because the prohibition is

2846
02:06:34,649 --> 02:06:45,839
one of the greatest things I've ever

2847
02:06:35,760 --> 02:06:47,760
heard you say and I agree with you and a

2848
02:06:45,840 --> 02:06:49,829
lot of people moved to Colorado to the

2849
02:06:47,760 --> 02:06:52,619
Pueblo area to grow outdoors because

2850
02:06:49,829 --> 02:06:55,619
this is an ideal climate there's the

2851
02:06:52,619 --> 02:06:58,199
reason that uh most the army troops that

2852
02:06:55,619 --> 02:06:59,970
have been Afghanistan and Iraq now go

2853
02:06:58,199 --> 02:07:03,479
through Fort Carson for training before

2854
02:06:59,970 --> 02:07:04,980
they go there yeah similar environment

2855
02:07:03,479 --> 02:07:06,750
we're up this altitude the air is thin

2856
02:07:04,979 --> 02:07:08,849
the temperature is the same yeah the

2857
02:07:06,750 --> 02:07:11,100
Hindukush valley no does that mean that

2858
02:07:08,850 --> 02:07:15,270
when they take over and they all come

2859
02:07:11,100 --> 02:07:17,010
here that they're coming to pueblos my

2860
02:07:15,270 --> 02:07:18,900
favorite place on the planet before we

2861
02:07:17,010 --> 02:07:21,090
legalize what I think it's beautiful

2862

2864
02:07:23,640 --> 02:07:27,240
food here is great

2865
02:07:25,050 --> 02:07:28,520
Olathe sweet corn people you don't know

2866
02:07:27,239 --> 02:07:30,679
what you're missing

02:07:28,520 --> 02:07:32,870
in Colorado right people are pretty

2868
02:07:30,680 --> 02:07:34,909
chill when family comes to visit they

2869
02:07:32,869 --> 02:07:40,760
always comment on how nice the drivers

2870
02:07:34,909 --> 02:07:43,579

2871

just all weren't dicks at the same time

2876
02:07:57,319 --> 02:08:01,309
somebody was telling me a story about

2877
02:07:58,909 --> 02:08:02,840
the cannabis cup another person was in

2878
02:08:01,310 --> 02:08:04,730

2880

02:08:05,149 --> 02:08:10,399
they spoke all crazy but she said the

2882
02:08:09,140 --> 02:08:11,810
friend that told me the story said he

2891
02:08:29,659 --> 02:08:35,359
grief from locals if they come here and

2892
02:08:32,569 --> 02:08:47,059
get excited about legal weed no live at

2893
02:08:35,359 --> 02:08:54,589

2894
02:08:47,060 --> 02:08:56,450

2897
02:08:58,069 --> 02:09:06,409
at all the first thing back in the good

2898
02:09:03,710 --> 02:09:08,000
old days but on the first watching

2899
02:09:06,409 --> 02:09:11,720

purchase and do the I've got legal weed

2901
02:09:11,720 --> 02:09:15,289
oh my god oh my god shuffle that's just

2902
02:09:13,850 --> 02:09:17,120
how I think of it is they're walking out

2903
02:09:15,289 --> 02:09:19,519
that it's more than a strut it's more

2904
02:09:17,119 --> 02:09:24,260
than a glide it's like a bounce kind of

2905
02:09:19,520 --> 02:09:26,060
ticker walks like this so yeah it didn't

2906
02:09:24,260 --> 02:09:26,659
matter if it was a gram or a half an

2907
02:09:26,060 --> 02:09:29,210
ounce

2908
02:09:26,659 --> 02:09:31,519
there's just the feeling of only [ __ ]

2909
02:09:29,210 --> 02:09:33,949
freedom it yeah no one can take this

2910
02:09:31,520 --> 02:09:36,320
away from you with it's magical and come

2911

2912
02:09:36,319 --> 02:09:42,269
yourself

2913
02:09:37,819 --> 02:09:45,179
it has become a verb it's so dumb it

2914
02:09:42,270 --> 02:09:46,530
became a verb instantly I was I was

2915
02:09:45,180 --> 02:09:48,030
actually I don't know if I've said this

2916
02:09:46,529 --> 02:09:49,859
on this show I was the first person to

2917
02:09:48,029 --> 02:09:55,198

2918
02:09:49,859 --> 02:09:57,420

2919
02:09:55,198 --> 02:10:02,819

2920

2938
02:10:37,738 --> 02:10:51,899
one where the reporter is that was a

2939
02:10:49,469 --> 02:10:54,149
really cool day those were all day I

2940
02:10:51,899 --> 02:11:00,448
remember a lot of stuff for that day for

2941
02:10:54,149 --> 02:11:02,488
sure so I was burst I bought weed first

2942
02:11:00,448 --> 02:11:04,169
and then I came home and met up with my

2943
02:11:02,488 --> 02:11:05,698
buddy that I did another podcast with

2944
02:11:04,170 --> 02:11:07,859
back in the day and him and I went back

2945
02:11:05,698 --> 02:11:09,149
out there it took our recording devices

2946
02:11:07,859 --> 02:11:12,149
and went and had a little bit of fun out

2947
02:11:09,149 --> 02:11:13,859
there for that and by then I was already

2948
02:11:12,149 --> 02:11:15,509
well known as the first guy that bought

2949
02:11:13,859 --> 02:11:16,679
pie don't know how everybody knew

2950
02:11:15,510 --> 02:11:18,480
already had only been three or four

2951
02:11:16,680 --> 02:11:20,449
hours there wasn't a lot to talk about

2952
02:11:18,479 --> 02:11:25,039
on that line so the news

2953
02:11:20,448 --> 02:11:26,419
came to my house and filmed us Mike and

2954
02:11:25,039 --> 02:11:38,090
I and another friend here hanging out

2955
02:11:26,420 --> 02:11:40,460
smoke I'm glad that they were way more

2956
02:11:38,090 --> 02:11:43,400
fascinated with the dreadlocks and the

2957
02:11:40,460 --> 02:11:45,829
dab rig than they were with the pasty

2958
02:11:43,399 --> 02:11:47,529
white guy in the corner two or three

2959
02:11:45,829 --> 02:11:50,479
dabs when the camera crew was here and

2960
02:11:47,529 --> 02:11:56,029
they put the tiny shitty week dab on the

2961
02:11:50,479 --> 02:11:57,439
news the news if I remember right they

2962
02:11:56,029 --> 02:12:00,889
didn't even actually put the whole dab

2963
02:11:57,439 --> 02:12:03,439
on either sister just me blown it out at

2964
02:12:00,890 --> 02:12:07,880
noon by then the camera guy was a little

2965
02:12:03,439 --> 02:12:14,899
lit his fault we got carried away in

2966
02:12:07,880 --> 02:12:17,600
sort of hotbox this room real fast and a

2967
02:12:14,899 --> 02:12:18,979
still camera lady and the still camera

2968
02:12:17,600 --> 02:12:20,630
lady was talking about how she wished

2969
02:12:18,979 --> 02:12:25,879
she could smoke but they drug test her

2970
02:12:20,630 --> 02:12:28,190
so I was making sure you know they did a

2971
02:12:25,880 --> 02:12:32,239
beep [ __ ] straight to Windy City last

2972
02:12:28,189 --> 02:12:49,159

2973
02:12:32,238 --> 02:12:51,169
asking questions every other week

2974
02:12:49,159 --> 02:12:53,210
council meetings she's always a real

2975
02:12:51,170 --> 02:12:55,460
sweetheart and tries to block me out of

2976
02:12:53,210 --> 02:12:57,560
her shot of whoever speaking just by

2977
02:12:55,460 --> 02:12:59,119
fate lines of stuff if she was if she

2978
02:12:57,560 --> 02:13:01,100
wanted to she could tip her camera up a

2979
02:12:59,119 --> 02:13:03,679
degree and a half and have my dumb bug

2980
02:13:01,100 --> 02:13:06,079
in every background shot but she cuts me

2981
02:13:03,679 --> 02:13:07,880
and I appreciate you've been seen as the

2982
02:13:06,079 --> 02:13:09,409
guy smoking bud here at the house you

2983
02:13:07,880 --> 02:13:18,409
don't need to be the guy on city council

2984
02:13:09,409 --> 02:13:19,939
also that'll look weird for us she's the

2985
02:13:18,409 --> 02:13:21,920
one that got this important news on the

2986
02:13:19,939 --> 02:13:24,139
air that cleans up real good yeah this

2987
02:13:21,920 --> 02:13:26,029
holds this all started when a reporter

2988
02:13:24,140 --> 02:13:27,650
from the chief 'men sent me an email how

2989
02:13:26,029 --> 02:13:31,309
he got my email I have no earthly idea

2990
02:13:27,649 --> 02:13:33,658
but I woke up to can you please find us

2991
02:13:31,310 --> 02:13:36,539
someone from the cannabis using

2992
02:13:33,658 --> 02:13:38,638
community that wants to comment on the

2993
02:13:36,539 --> 02:13:40,500
City Council attempting to ban all home

2994
02:13:38,639 --> 02:13:45,270
growing in Iowa

2995
02:13:40,500 --> 02:13:52,529
wait what that's news to me and yeah it

2996
02:13:45,270 --> 02:13:54,270
seems like we need to remind people that

2997
02:13:52,529 --> 02:13:57,269
what's gonna happen is the draft will be

2998
02:13:54,270 --> 02:13:58,920
presented on October 15th to the City

2999
02:13:57,270 --> 02:14:00,989
Council well we've got to do is go to

3000
02:13:58,920 --> 02:14:02,639
the City Council meeting on the 13th and

3001
02:14:00,988 --> 02:14:04,289
kind of be pre-emptive show them look we

3002
02:14:02,639 --> 02:14:07,079
know this is coming we're here to

3003
02:14:04,289 --> 02:14:08,760
influence you first if come up with good

3004
02:14:07,079 --> 02:14:10,559
reasons why it's [ __ ] and if you

3005
02:14:08,760 --> 02:14:11,670
have if you got a speaking voice if

3006
02:14:10,560 --> 02:14:14,340
you're not scared to speak in front of

3007
02:14:11,670 --> 02:14:16,230
people go speak to the City Council it's

3008
02:14:14,340 --> 02:14:18,449
a public forum explain to them that they

3009
02:14:16,229 --> 02:14:19,948
can't make us grow in private buildings

3010
02:14:18,448 --> 02:14:21,960
because first that tells the robbers

3011
02:14:19,948 --> 02:14:22,919
right where our weed is second that

3012
02:14:21,960 --> 02:14:24,658
tells your neighbors that you are

3013
02:14:22,920 --> 02:14:26,969
actually growing cannabis if they didn't

3014
02:14:24,658 --> 02:14:29,339
already know if third you can't afford a

3015
02:14:26,969 --> 02:14:30,929
damn building for that's gonna make more

3016
02:14:29,340 --> 02:14:33,050
electricity for Black Hills to go wire

3017
02:14:30,929 --> 02:14:35,369
up that should be number one okay

3018
02:14:33,050 --> 02:14:37,289
see all these reasons already add up

3019
02:14:35,369 --> 02:14:39,469
second of all what are we doing wrong

3020
02:14:37,289 --> 02:14:41,639
there's a couple of people screwing up

3021
02:14:39,469 --> 02:14:43,710
go make those people correct their

3022
02:14:41,639 --> 02:14:45,810
things don't for a couple of people

3023
02:14:43,710 --> 02:14:47,698
screw-ups this does nothing to go over

3024
02:14:45,810 --> 02:14:50,100
to actor try to attack the actual

3025
02:14:47,698 --> 02:14:54,589
criminal element that does happen from

3026
02:14:50,100 --> 02:14:57,449
some home gross well the person growing

3027
02:14:54,590 --> 02:14:58,949
weed in their home on the black market

3028
02:14:57,448 --> 02:15:00,509
for sale on the black market isn't

3029
02:14:58,948 --> 02:15:02,069
bothering to follow any of the rules and

3030
02:15:00,510 --> 02:15:03,449
they're doing so they're doing

3031
02:15:02,069 --> 02:15:05,549
everything covertly because they don't

3032
02:15:03,448 --> 02:15:07,319
want to get caught and arrested the

3033
02:15:05,550 --> 02:15:09,600
people who are standing up following the

3034
02:15:07,319 --> 02:15:11,549
letter Aloha but being dickish about it

3035
02:15:09,600 --> 02:15:12,840
are just bringing a black eye to the

3036
02:15:11,550 --> 02:15:16,560
whole community and causing everybody

3037
02:15:12,840 --> 02:15:19,980
problems if we legalize if enough idiots

3038
02:15:16,560 --> 02:15:21,929
grew up they're gonna take that away the

3039
02:15:19,979 --> 02:15:27,809
next president could send the [ __ ]

02:17:00,468 --> 02:17:09,569
anymore we'd like to give you a dad but

3055
02:17:07,649 --> 02:17:11,308
on the show you're gonna like 30 minutes

3056
02:17:09,569 --> 02:17:12,779
give me the tiniest little baby girlie

3057
02:17:11,308 --> 02:17:13,949
dad start talking while I get him ready

3058
02:17:12,780 --> 02:17:14,909
I'll take one first and by the time

3059
02:17:13,950 --> 02:17:18,450
they're done I'll have a couple dabs

3060
02:17:14,909 --> 02:17:21,959
going so one of the things me about the

3061
02:17:18,450 --> 02:17:23,550
cannabis community is for the last 80

3062
02:17:21,959 --> 02:17:25,739
years or so we've been forced

3063
02:17:23,549 --> 02:17:28,228
underground and into the dark and then

3064
02:17:25,739 --> 02:17:29,940
out of the way and out of sight and

3065
02:17:28,228 --> 02:17:33,558
that's how we survived and that's how

3066
02:17:29,940 --> 02:17:36,659
we've thrived but now that it's legal

3067
02:17:33,558 --> 02:17:40,529
more of us need to stand the [ __ ] up

3068
02:17:36,659 --> 02:17:43,739
and show up to City Council and show up

3069
02:17:40,530 --> 02:17:46,250
to vote and show up during budget

3070
02:17:43,739 --> 02:17:48,289
meetings and have our voices heard

3071
02:17:46,250 --> 02:17:51,500
we're used to hiding and pretending like

3072
02:17:48,290 --> 02:17:55,489
we're not part of the system and we're

3073
02:17:51,500 --> 02:17:58,909
against the system but we live here too

3074
02:17:55,488 --> 02:18:01,818
it's our city - were we have just as

3075
02:17:58,909 --> 02:18:04,398
much right to have our city be like we

3076
02:18:01,818 --> 02:18:08,539
would like it as anyone else in the city

3077
02:18:04,398 --> 02:18:11,539
and if nobody shows up and speaks out

3078
02:18:08,540 --> 02:18:14,000
against a ban on all home growing that

3079
02:18:11,540 --> 02:18:15,950
requires you to build a building city

3080
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:18,200
councils not gonna care that it's

3081
02:18:15,950 --> 02:18:19,340
ridiculous and unenforceable and a

3082
02:18:18,200 --> 02:18:21,439
horrible idea

3083
02:18:19,340 --> 02:18:24,648
they're gonna go ahead and approve it

3084
02:18:21,439 --> 02:18:27,019
because without thinking about it just

3085
02:18:24,648 --> 02:18:28,670
on a quick gut check it seems like you

3086
02:18:27,019 --> 02:18:30,469
ought to have the right to wake up in

3087
02:18:28,670 --> 02:18:33,409
the morning and not smell marijuana and

3088
02:18:30,468 --> 02:18:35,598
this ordinance might do that once for

3089
02:18:33,409 --> 02:18:38,119
somebody maybe so sure go ahead and

3090
02:18:35,599 --> 02:18:40,370
approve it and if nobody's willing to

3091
02:18:38,120 --> 02:18:42,889
throw on some clean clothes and show up

3092
02:18:40,370 --> 02:18:46,099
Monday night at 7 o'clock and say hey I

3093
02:18:42,888 --> 02:18:47,959
think this is a really bad idea and I'd

3094
02:18:46,099 --> 02:18:50,568
appreciate you not passing this

3095
02:18:47,959 --> 02:18:52,728
ordinance who knows what's gonna happen

3096
02:18:50,568 --> 02:18:54,859
I mean I think they're gonna kill it I

3097
02:18:52,728 --> 02:18:57,558
think that if I show up and one or two

3098
02:18:54,859 --> 02:18:59,450
other people show up and speak that

3099
02:18:57,558 --> 02:19:01,218
they'll go ahead and kill it on the

3100
02:18:59,450 --> 02:19:03,649
fifteenth or next month or whatever but

3101
02:19:01,218 --> 02:19:05,709
who knows nobody's willing to stand up

3102
02:19:03,648 --> 02:19:08,869
and that's part of the reason city

3103
02:19:05,709 --> 02:19:11,449
doesn't have any medical shops in it or

3104
02:19:08,870 --> 02:19:13,370
any rec shops yet because so far it's

3105
02:19:11,450 --> 02:19:15,679
just me down at City Council saying we

3106
02:19:13,370 --> 02:19:17,750
ought to have these for a minute we had

3107
02:19:15,679 --> 02:19:19,488
a little cannabis community group but

3108
02:19:17,750 --> 02:19:21,468
they fell apart pretty quick quite

3109
02:19:19,488 --> 02:19:23,420
quickly like you don't need a group

3110
02:19:21,468 --> 02:19:27,589
though you just you just need to be a

3111
02:19:23,420 --> 02:19:29,000
citizen who's willing to show up so

3112
02:19:27,590 --> 02:19:32,389
here's something that I've kind of

3113
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:35,540
tossed around in my head way Mike and I

3114
02:19:32,388 --> 02:19:37,250
had a shop together you know we ran that

3115
02:19:35,540 --> 02:19:38,989
place there were a couple times when we

3116
02:19:37,250 --> 02:19:41,599
had to go to court for a couple of

3117
02:19:38,988 --> 02:19:42,949
things and to support a member of our

3118
02:19:41,599 --> 02:19:45,200
group that I always had a court trial

3119
02:19:42,950 --> 02:19:49,069
also we went to a couple of City Council

3120
02:19:45,200 --> 02:19:51,050
things to try to speak up I look like

3121
02:19:49,068 --> 02:19:52,969
your tip I I know it I look like a

3122
02:19:51,049 --> 02:19:55,399
cliche for you can pothead that's cool

3123
02:19:52,969 --> 02:19:57,379
to email out of my court no problem

3124
02:19:55,399 --> 02:19:59,970
[Music]

3125
02:19:57,379 --> 02:20:02,640
it's not the first time that's happened

3126
02:19:59,970 --> 02:20:05,039
to tell you the truth how to take with a

3127
02:20:02,640 --> 02:20:07,800
mic in front of me also so I'm talking

3128
02:20:05,040 --> 02:20:09,960
about I used to go to those City Council

3129
02:20:07,800 --> 02:20:12,720
meetings and then I'm saying I'm six

3130
02:20:09,959 --> 02:20:15,029
foot five with dreadlocks to my ass do

3131
02:20:12,720 --> 02:20:16,591
my dreadlocks go past my ass now I've

3132
02:20:15,030 --> 02:20:23,101
got four foot ropes hanging off of my

3133
02:20:16,591 --> 02:20:24,780
head he does a collared shirt and I look

3134
02:20:23,101 --> 02:20:26,940
good I still got these rastaman

3135
02:20:24,780 --> 02:20:27,391
dreadlocks dr. Carl Hart feels your pain

3136
02:20:26,940 --> 02:20:30,829
sir

3137
02:20:27,390 --> 02:20:34,170
I feel theirs

3138
02:20:30,829 --> 02:20:35,670
I'm almost a detriment to the community

3139
02:20:34,170 --> 02:20:37,860
when I go to city council meetings and

3140
02:20:35,670 --> 02:20:39,899
show like look here's Rasta man hear

3141
02:20:37,860 --> 02:20:41,341
that I feel like I'm a weight on the

3142
02:20:39,899 --> 02:20:45,659
community when I show up I kind of hide

3143
02:20:41,341 --> 02:20:49,110
because of that I would say that you're

3144
02:20:45,659 --> 02:20:51,300
a self-employed successful citizen of

3145
02:20:49,110 --> 02:20:53,130
our beautiful city and have as much of a

3146
02:20:51,300 --> 02:20:55,649
right to stand up and claim your piece

3147
02:20:53,129 --> 02:20:58,409
of it is the best dressed cleanest

3148
02:20:55,649 --> 02:21:04,979
shaved [ __ ] in here I was just

3149
02:20:58,409 --> 02:21:11,431
gonna say you don't have to change who

3150
02:21:04,979 --> 02:21:14,670
you are everybody gets a vote everybody

3151
02:21:11,431 --> 02:21:16,591
gets to say period the rules of this the

3152
02:21:14,670 --> 02:21:19,890
City Council meetings anyone who comes

3153
02:21:16,591 --> 02:21:21,841
and signs up to speak before the meeting

3154
02:21:19,890 --> 02:21:23,369
I they usually limit it to six but

3155
02:21:21,841 --> 02:21:24,720
they've been allowing more than six

3156
02:21:23,370 --> 02:21:27,391
people to speak at the beginning of most

3157
02:21:24,720 --> 02:21:30,511
meetings lately because of all the

3158
02:21:27,390 --> 02:21:33,149
hubbub and the recall stuff but if you

3159
02:21:30,511 --> 02:21:34,470
show up to speak you can't you get your

3160
02:21:33,149 --> 02:21:37,379
five minutes as long as you're not

3161
02:21:34,470 --> 02:21:38,430
cussing or throwing things you can say

3162
02:21:37,379 --> 02:21:41,189
whatever you want and there's these old

3163
02:21:38,431 --> 02:21:43,460
crotchety people that show up and [ __ ]

3164
02:21:41,190 --> 02:21:47,190
about whatever their passion issue is

3165
02:21:43,459 --> 02:21:49,169
every two weeks at every single meeting

3166
02:21:47,190 --> 02:21:50,971
they take five minutes at the beginning

3167
02:21:49,170 --> 02:21:52,890
of the meeting to stand up and say I

3168
02:21:50,970 --> 02:21:55,079
don't like any of you I hate what you're

3169
02:21:52,890 --> 02:21:58,170
doing I need all of you to stop right

3170
02:21:55,079 --> 02:22:00,181
now it's illegal I hate you he takes

3171
02:21:58,170 --> 02:22:01,800
five minutes to do every meeting and he

3172
02:22:00,181 --> 02:22:04,239
sits down and his crotchety friend gets

3173
02:22:01,800 --> 02:22:07,059
up and does the same thing

3174
02:22:04,239 --> 02:22:09,850
they're not any more valid or legitimate

3175
02:22:07,059 --> 02:22:11,799
than you with your dreadlocks or Jessie

3176
02:22:09,850 --> 02:22:13,690
with this beard or me with my earrings

3177
02:22:11,799 --> 02:22:15,549
just cuz I clean up a little better than

3178
02:22:13,690 --> 02:22:18,069
y'all as far as the cops your concern

3179
02:22:15,549 --> 02:22:21,189
doesn't mean you deserve less or more

3180
02:22:18,069 --> 02:22:23,110
space in City Council than I take the

3181
02:22:21,190 --> 02:22:24,280
only reason they talk to me is cuz I

3182
02:22:23,110 --> 02:22:26,739
show up all the time and I'm familiar

3183
02:22:24,280 --> 02:22:29,680
face most people leave halfway through

3184
02:22:26,739 --> 02:22:31,930
the meeting and then it's just the

3185
02:22:29,680 --> 02:22:34,569
people that are stuck there playing a

3186
02:22:31,930 --> 02:22:36,309
role in going through the pageantry of

3187
02:22:34,569 --> 02:22:39,129
city government and because I'm willing

3188
02:22:36,309 --> 02:22:41,590
to hang out for that last hour I can

3189
02:22:39,129 --> 02:22:43,509
call City Council on two o'clock in the

3190
02:22:41,590 --> 02:22:45,100
afternoon and by 8 o'clock I've talked

3191
02:22:43,510 --> 02:22:49,889
to the three of them personally for like

3192
02:22:45,100 --> 02:22:52,450
15 minutes each [ __ ] stoner do like

3193
02:22:49,889 --> 02:22:55,269
I'm just willing to stand up and claim

3194
02:22:52,450 --> 02:22:56,829
my little spot at the table I like it my

3195
02:22:55,270 --> 02:22:58,840
other question is am I gonna attract

3196
02:22:56,829 --> 02:23:00,370
unwanted attention to myself like I'm

3197
02:22:58,840 --> 02:23:05,020
not doing anything I shouldn't be but am

3198
02:23:00,370 --> 02:23:11,500
i bringing we'd had trouble to myself

3199
02:23:05,020 --> 02:23:12,729
that the cops are too busy yeah a friend

3200
02:23:11,500 --> 02:23:14,260
of mine likes to tell a story a

3201
02:23:12,728 --> 02:23:17,079
girlfriend got mad at him and called the

3202
02:23:14,260 --> 02:23:20,340
cops and said my boyfriend's growing too

3203
02:23:17,079 --> 02:23:20,340
much weed in the conference

3204
02:23:22,228 --> 02:23:26,829
we've got heroin falling off the truck

3205
02:23:24,700 --> 02:23:28,600
here we've got teen pregnancy rate that

3206
02:23:26,829 --> 02:23:32,559
rivals most counties high school

3207
02:23:28,600 --> 02:23:34,750
graduation rates like cops are busy the

3208
02:23:32,559 --> 02:23:36,760
kids that's going to City Council with

3209
02:23:34,750 --> 02:23:38,559
dreadlocks and standing up saying I

3210
02:23:36,760 --> 02:23:40,840
don't like this ordinance please don't

3211
02:23:38,559 --> 02:23:42,850
vote for it it's not someone they need

3212
02:23:40,840 --> 02:23:44,978
to worry about now if you show up to

3213
02:23:42,850 --> 02:23:46,870
throw a rock at Sandy DAF they're

3214
02:23:44,978 --> 02:23:48,159
probably gonna pay attention to who you

3215
02:23:46,870 --> 02:23:49,479
are and follow you out of the building

3216
02:23:48,159 --> 02:23:52,629
and give you a lot of problems but if

3217
02:23:49,478 --> 02:23:55,449
you stand up and act like a citizen they

3218
02:23:52,629 --> 02:23:57,670
will treat you like a citizen because

3219
02:23:55,450 --> 02:23:59,530
doing so anything else is technically a

3220
02:23:57,670 --> 02:24:06,010
crime can I wear a hat in the courtroom

3221
02:23:59,530 --> 02:24:07,720
yep nice people show up in pajamas the

3222
02:24:06,010 --> 02:24:09,850
trash haulers are down there a lot a lot

3223
02:24:07,719 --> 02:24:12,760
of them come straight from work

3224
02:24:09,850 --> 02:24:15,760
I mean Araki works full-time is a mail

3225
02:24:12,760 --> 02:24:19,630
carrier and more often than not is in

3226
02:24:15,760 --> 02:24:22,050
her work uniform like even Montoya shows

3227
02:24:19,629 --> 02:24:26,770
up in a t-shirt nine meetings out of ten

3228
02:24:22,049 --> 02:24:27,459
I mean if someone on the council isn't a

3229
02:24:26,771 --> 02:24:30,010
t-shirt

3230
02:24:27,459 --> 02:24:31,779
you should feel fine and a grassroots

3231
02:24:30,010 --> 02:24:35,889
hat keeping your dreadlocks out of your

3232
02:24:31,780 --> 02:24:39,370
face like it's a lot of us he's talking

3233
02:24:35,889 --> 02:24:41,409
to you guys it's really boring it's it's

3234
02:24:39,370 --> 02:24:43,570
city government it's a lot of people

3235
02:24:41,409 --> 02:24:45,789
mumbling about really hyper specific

3236
02:24:43,569 --> 02:24:49,469
rules and it's sort of bore yourself to

3237
02:24:45,790 --> 02:24:52,420
tears dull but it affects your life on a

3238
02:24:49,469 --> 02:24:54,189
number of in a number of ways regularly

3239
02:24:52,420 --> 02:24:57,340
and right now they're looking to kill

3240
02:24:54,190 --> 02:25:01,300
countless small businesses in every

3241
02:24:57,340 --> 02:25:03,729
caregiver in the in the city limits rule

3242
02:25:01,299 --> 02:25:05,739
trying to kill smells we just wrote them

3243
02:25:03,729 --> 02:25:18,430
a pretty nice little sales tax check for

3244
02:25:05,739 --> 02:25:20,260
her first quarter business to derail

3245
02:25:18,430 --> 02:25:21,309
Mike subject here but guys a lot of

3246
02:25:20,260 --> 02:25:23,920
people want to talk to Jesse about

3247
02:25:21,309 --> 02:25:26,020
growing stuff from the show catch him at

3248
02:25:23,920 --> 02:25:27,280
hydro indoor growing supplies distract

3249
02:25:26,021 --> 02:25:28,390
him so that he can't get his work done

3250
02:25:27,280 --> 02:25:29,771
it's much more fun to stand there and

3251
02:25:28,389 --> 02:25:31,719
help you guys out there it is the stack

3252
02:25:29,771 --> 02:25:43,300
[ __ ] up all day if you bring tabs down

3253
02:25:31,719 --> 02:25:44,260
that's a good way to distract you are if

3254
02:25:43,299 --> 02:25:47,459
you're taking dads while you're working

3255
02:25:44,260 --> 02:25:47,460
I'm just about to law

3256
02:25:48,479 --> 02:25:53,229
come to city if you live in Pueblo

3257
02:25:50,739 --> 02:25:55,000
Colorado is it just City or does the

3258
02:25:53,229 --> 02:25:56,529
county count if you're part of the

3259
02:25:55,000 --> 02:25:59,920
county come out to all of this stuff

3260
02:25:56,530 --> 02:26:02,471
affects you guys if if the city bans all

3261
02:25:59,920 --> 02:26:05,681
home growing the county is going to

3262
02:26:02,470 --> 02:26:07,869
experience a mass exodus of cannabis

3263
02:26:05,681 --> 02:26:10,210
caregivers into the county and with the

3264
02:26:07,870 --> 02:26:12,431
fit they've been pitching over one weed

3265
02:26:10,209 --> 02:26:15,339
farm out and whatever that road is I

3266
02:26:12,431 --> 02:26:19,450
don't imagine they'd like the 3,000 plus

3267
02:26:15,340 --> 02:26:21,729
caregivers in Pablo County in have since

3268
02:26:19,450 --> 02:26:24,070
the medical where medical marijuana

3269
02:26:21,729 --> 02:26:27,670
program started publishing that

3270
02:26:24,069 --> 02:26:29,079
information about a decade ago like all

3271
02:26:27,670 --> 02:26:30,460
these people gonna have to pack their

3272
02:26:29,079 --> 02:26:32,351
[ __ ] up take it to the county and the

3273
02:26:30,459 --> 02:26:34,000
county arity to handle that so County

3274
02:26:32,351 --> 02:26:36,069
folks show up and say this is a terrible

3275
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:38,530
idea I'm a well-established caregiver

3276
02:26:36,069 --> 02:26:40,270
I've been caregiving for five or six

3277
02:26:38,530 --> 02:26:42,101
years professionally I call myself a

3278
02:26:40,271 --> 02:26:44,590
professional caregiver I do very well at

3279
02:26:42,101 --> 02:26:48,940
it my patients love my products right

3280
02:26:44,590 --> 02:26:50,920
they count on it they rely on it I have

3281
02:26:48,940 --> 02:26:52,899
got a system designed where I can

3282
02:26:50,920 --> 02:26:54,579
provide exactly what they need I know

3283
02:26:52,899 --> 02:26:57,129
when my patients are gonna call I know

3284
02:26:54,579 --> 02:26:58,659
when I know when my old friend I know

3285
02:26:57,129 --> 02:27:01,839
exactly when he's gonna run out I know

3286
02:26:58,659 --> 02:27:04,090
when everybody I've got him scheduled to

3287
02:27:01,840 --> 02:27:05,860
have to redo my grow to build another

3288
02:27:04,090 --> 02:27:09,280
building would cause me to have to leave

3289
02:27:05,860 --> 02:27:11,950
this town which would put five people

3290
02:27:09,280 --> 02:27:14,940
that I'm responsible for and some deep

3291
02:27:11,950 --> 02:27:16,690
[ __ ] with their cannabis needs yeah one

3292
02:27:14,940 --> 02:27:17,980
where are they gonna get it because

3293
02:27:16,690 --> 02:27:19,300
there's not there aren't gonna be any

3294
02:27:17,979 --> 02:27:21,520
other care givers to take my spot

3295
02:27:19,299 --> 02:27:24,189
because they can't grow no in their

3296
02:27:21,521 --> 02:27:25,630
indoor environment like not everybody's

3297
02:27:24,190 --> 02:27:27,899
got a breeding facility somewhere else

3298
02:27:25,629 --> 02:27:27,899
to work with

3299
02:27:31,760 --> 02:27:40,260
not to mention I mean just the the loss

3300
02:27:34,590 --> 02:27:44,280
of revenue I think a minute 64 even with

3301
02:27:40,260 --> 02:27:47,370
pueblos every corner they've been able

3302
02:27:44,280 --> 02:27:50,370
to stop being having retail stores and

3303
02:27:47,370 --> 02:27:53,399
grows in city limits and of Pueblo still

3304
02:27:50,370 --> 02:27:57,300
prospered from amendment 64 you know in

3305
02:27:53,398 --> 02:28:00,180
in in small ways but the secondary

3306
02:27:57,299 --> 02:28:02,159
employment this is come from 64 public

3307
02:28:00,180 --> 02:28:04,680
still enjoying all the electricians the

3308
02:28:02,159 --> 02:28:07,200
plumbers the caregivers you know the

3309
02:28:04,680 --> 02:28:14,460
grossed or people moving makes a lot of

3310
02:28:07,200 --> 02:28:16,710
money from us there was a higher profit

3311
02:28:14,459 --> 02:28:19,589
margin on it there's a last depression

3312
02:28:16,709 --> 02:28:22,529
the one gross store on fourth Streets

3313
02:28:19,590 --> 02:28:26,700
rung up what three new locations and two

3314
02:28:22,530 --> 02:28:30,319
new competitors bloomed yeah folks and

3315
02:28:26,700 --> 02:28:33,359
we've got four now they're five or six

3316
02:28:30,318 --> 02:28:36,719
driving distances here right and they're

3317
02:28:33,359 --> 02:28:38,670
all surviving just fine because there's

3318
02:28:36,719 --> 02:28:40,559
a lot of employment bleeding off this

3319
02:28:38,670 --> 02:28:41,969
industry yeah I'm gonna do a shameless

3320
02:28:40,559 --> 02:28:43,139
plug right here I've been to all of the

3321
02:28:41,969 --> 02:28:46,019
hydro shops in this town

3322
02:28:43,139 --> 02:28:47,909
that's no doubt at all all of them

3323
02:28:46,020 --> 02:28:50,220
several times and there's a reason why

3324
02:28:47,909 --> 02:28:52,459
I've chosen one specific shop to be my

3325
02:28:50,219 --> 02:28:52,459
sponsor

3326
02:28:53,140 --> 02:28:57,460
I was almost out there today just by

3327
02:28:55,630 --> 02:28:58,989
happenstance yeah he did something and

3328
02:28:57,460 --> 02:29:01,300
that was what dawned on me that's the

3329
02:28:58,989 --> 02:29:02,681
place to go yeah we're gonna have to

3330
02:29:01,300 --> 02:29:05,081
work out some kind of coupon code or

3331
02:29:02,681 --> 02:29:07,091

3332
02:29:05,081 --> 02:29:08,831

02:29:17,921 --> 02:29:24,761
work at the Pueblo location because

3338
02:29:19,890 --> 02:29:30,489

3345
02:29:40,450 --> 02:29:44,230
possibly a t-shirt and maybe a couple of

3346
02:29:42,341 --> 02:29:44,831
hat pins they need to be given away to

3347

3348
02:29:44,831 --> 02:29:48,521

3349
02:29:46,360 --> 02:29:53,409
Instagram and Facebook giveaways feel

3350
02:29:48,521 --> 02:30:09,671
cheesy to anybody who talks not [ __ ]

3351
02:29:53,409 --> 02:30:12,610
at council back on the subject of the

3352
02:30:09,671 --> 02:30:15,761
proposed ordinance they mentioned

3353
02:30:12,610 --> 02:30:17,381
something about realtor landlords in

3354
02:30:15,761 --> 02:30:21,640
there and I kind of thought that was BS

3355
02:30:17,380 --> 02:30:24,581
too I know a couple local landlords one

3356
02:30:21,640 --> 02:30:26,979
of them has over 30 properties and the

3357
02:30:24,581 --> 02:30:29,140
other one has 18 properties and some of

3358
02:30:26,979 --> 02:30:32,680
those are big duplexes or apartment

3359
02:30:29,140 --> 02:30:34,380
buildings they don't care they actually

3360
02:30:32,681 --> 02:30:37,829
tell their tenants they don't care that

3361
02:30:34,380 --> 02:30:40,430
you know I'm sorry I can't name them but

3362
02:30:37,829 --> 02:30:43,260
they don't care golden information

3363
02:30:40,430 --> 02:30:45,060
almost all of their tenants grow almost

3364
02:30:43,260 --> 02:30:47,810
all their tenants pay rent on time they

3365
02:30:45,060 --> 02:30:51,539
take care of their houses they love them

3366
02:30:47,810 --> 02:30:53,039
they you know so I don't know where they

3367
02:30:51,540 --> 02:30:56,250
came up with landlords are pissed about

3368
02:30:53,040 --> 02:30:58,410
this because no one in the industry

3369
02:30:56,250 --> 02:31:00,690
stands up if you're on City Council if

3370
02:30:58,409 --> 02:31:04,260
you're the police chief or the fire

3371
02:31:00,690 --> 02:31:06,659
chief you don't meet care givers like

3372
02:31:04,260 --> 02:31:09,120
you to you meet the care giver who said

3373
02:31:06,659 --> 02:31:11,760
his [ __ ] house on fire you meet the

3374
02:31:09,120 --> 02:31:14,490
care giver who got to got drunk at the

3375
02:31:11,760 --> 02:31:18,800
bar and back into the somebody's car

3376
02:31:14,489 --> 02:31:18,799
with three pounds in the trunk and like

3377
02:31:18,889 --> 02:31:23,399
somebody blew that garage apart open

3378
02:31:21,479 --> 02:31:27,869
blasting and smoking a cigarette at the

3379
02:31:23,399 --> 02:31:29,579
same time good point and because you

3380
02:31:27,870 --> 02:31:31,470
guys are good at what you do and you've

3381
02:31:29,579 --> 02:31:34,590
never blown yourself up or set your

3382
02:31:31,469 --> 02:31:36,659
house on fire they've never met you

3383
02:31:34,590 --> 02:31:38,969
they've never heard of you've never seen

3384
02:31:36,659 --> 02:31:41,489
pictures of your garden if I could take

3385
02:31:38,969 --> 02:31:44,129
pictures of your grow room and take them

3386
02:31:41,489 --> 02:31:47,430
to City Council I could give them an

3387
02:31:44,129 --> 02:31:48,899
idea of what looking or what doing it

3388
02:31:47,430 --> 02:31:50,850
right looks like because they've only

3389
02:31:48,899 --> 02:31:52,649
ever seen the one that the cops got

3390
02:31:50,850 --> 02:31:54,989
called on and the cops took pictures of

3391
02:31:52,649 --> 02:31:57,779
I mean that's part of the problem there

3392
02:31:54,989 --> 02:32:02,280
unless you're reading High Times or Kush

3393
02:31:57,780 --> 02:32:03,540

02:32:28,500 --> 02:32:33,569
nice little secret cup sir

3406
02:32:30,629 --> 02:32:35,779
man I was dabbing I looked up and

3407
02:32:33,569 --> 02:32:38,149
suddenly Jesse was at the secret cup

3408
02:32:35,780 --> 02:32:40,890
that was pretty sweet

3409
02:32:38,149 --> 02:32:43,260
and then I blinked and he was gone

3410
02:32:40,889 --> 02:32:43,869
I was literally repotting plants I was

3411
02:32:43,260 --> 02:32:45,649
like [ __ ] it

3412
02:32:43,870 --> 02:32:48,090
[Music]

3413
02:32:45,649 --> 02:32:49,500
it was about 45 minutes to get there I

3414
02:32:48,090 --> 02:32:55,770
think your travel time was more than

3415
02:32:49,500 --> 02:32:59,569
what you spent there best drive time

3416
02:32:55,770 --> 02:33:02,579
ever you know there was so like exciting

3417
02:32:59,569 --> 02:33:04,590
yes so cool yeah big shout out to our

3418
02:33:02,579 --> 02:33:07,228
buddy Spitz for taking home the first

3419
02:33:04,590 --> 02:33:09,000
place at the secret cut Mountain region

3420
02:33:07,228 --> 02:33:10,199
I keep wishing him the best of luck in

3421
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:11,159
Vegas but I'm pretty sure he's gonna

3422
02:33:10,200 --> 02:33:12,870
bring it home for us

3423
02:33:11,159 --> 02:33:15,780
okay he put this little town on the map

3424
02:33:12,870 --> 02:33:17,520
bro yeah and see I mean that's so

3425
02:33:15,780 --> 02:33:19,439
positive too we're always on the map for

3426
02:33:17,520 --> 02:33:22,500
some psychotically horrid [ __ ] you know

3427
02:33:19,439 --> 02:33:24,479
it's so nice when it's positive you know

3428
02:33:22,500 --> 02:33:27,299
um another thing I want to say is most

3429
02:33:24,478 --> 02:33:29,429
caregivers basements I've seen that's

3430
02:33:27,299 --> 02:33:33,478
just a general term for where their girl

3431
02:33:29,430 --> 02:33:35,850
is most of them are way cleaner than

3432
02:33:33,478 --> 02:33:37,879
most dispensaries uh girls I've seen

3433
02:33:35,850 --> 02:33:40,770
that's just the honest truth

3434
02:33:37,879 --> 02:33:43,920
nine days out of ten I'd be happy eating

3435
02:33:40,770 --> 02:33:45,810
off Jeff's grill on the floor I've got a

3436
02:33:43,920 --> 02:33:49,020
little bit of OCD and that plays very

3437
02:33:45,809 --> 02:33:50,699
well being a pot farmer it does notice

3438
02:33:49,020 --> 02:33:52,409
my front yard is clean my back yard is

3439
02:33:50,700 --> 02:33:54,270
clean the sides of my house are clean I

3440
02:33:52,409 --> 02:33:55,829
asked my neighbors neighbors to remove

3441
02:33:54,270 --> 02:33:57,720
some debris they had over there they had

3442
02:33:55,829 --> 02:33:58,829
a trailer with like old wood they had

3443
02:33:57,719 --> 02:34:00,539
chopped down and they didn't take it

3444
02:33:58,829 --> 02:34:01,950
away for a long time I was like hate to

3445
02:34:00,540 --> 02:34:03,960
be a stickler but could you possibly

3446
02:34:01,950 --> 02:34:05,220
take away that wood and if you need some

3447
02:34:03,959 --> 02:34:07,199
more reasons why I'll let you know why

3448
02:34:05,219 --> 02:34:10,728
it's bugging me I'm sorry we'll get rid

3449
02:34:07,200 --> 02:34:13,260
of it and they took every little board

3450
02:34:10,728 --> 02:34:15,420
my weeds are pulled all the time my

3451
02:34:13,260 --> 02:34:17,550
garden my back backyard garden is clean

3452
02:34:15,420 --> 02:34:19,260
because I can't afford the bugs that

3453
02:34:17,549 --> 02:34:20,340
that will frame I'll bring more problems

3454
02:34:19,260 --> 02:34:22,350
and it also makes your house look like

3455
02:34:20,340 --> 02:34:23,728
[ __ ] and being a pot grower I want to be

3456
02:34:22,350 --> 02:34:26,909
a good citizen and not make my house

3457
02:34:23,728 --> 02:34:29,369
look like [ __ ] I mean that's part of the

3458
02:34:26,909 --> 02:34:31,739
thing no one sees this no one sees how

3459
02:34:29,370 --> 02:34:33,780
well most of the industry does it the

3460
02:34:31,739 --> 02:34:36,299
most of City Council hasn't bothered to

3461
02:34:33,780 --> 02:34:38,250
go out and visit any of the legal

3462
02:34:36,299 --> 02:34:39,750
marijuana stores in town some of which

3463
02:34:38,250 --> 02:34:42,120
have been open for like seven eight

3464
02:34:39,750 --> 02:34:45,989
years now I mean how long's marisol been

3465
02:34:42,120 --> 02:34:47,640
open and they can't make that drive it's

3466
02:34:45,989 --> 02:34:49,398
not exactly the best example like this

3467
02:34:47,639 --> 02:34:52,218
run out but like it's been

3468
02:34:49,398 --> 02:34:54,559
that's the first dispensary we gotta

3469
02:34:52,218 --> 02:34:56,269
give them credit it's the first and I

3470
02:34:54,559 --> 02:34:57,918
mean you can't go out there and check if

3471
02:34:56,270 --> 02:34:59,179
it's something that's so scary and

3472
02:34:57,918 --> 02:35:00,798
should be fought like shouldn't you

3473
02:34:59,179 --> 02:35:02,509
understand your opponent to kill it or

3474
02:35:00,799 --> 02:35:04,459
at least some nonsense like that and go

3475
02:35:02,509 --> 02:35:04,789
see it once some Jedi [ __ ] right there

3476
02:35:04,459 --> 02:35:07,668
bro

3477
02:35:04,789 --> 02:35:09,770
but it's if they see it from the parking

3478
02:35:07,668 --> 02:35:17,838
lot don't have to go in and inject some

3479
02:35:09,770 --> 02:35:20,658
marijuana's walk into your grow room and

3480
02:35:17,838 --> 02:35:23,689
close your eyes and breathe and if it

3481
02:35:20,658 --> 02:35:24,978
smells like wet or smells like plants

3482
02:35:23,689 --> 02:35:26,328
you're doing it wrong

3483
02:35:24,978 --> 02:35:28,338
you need more ventilation you need more

3484
02:35:26,328 --> 02:35:29,509
air out and more fresh air in you don't

3485
02:35:28,338 --> 02:35:31,248
want to be able to smell that [ __ ] in

3486
02:35:29,509 --> 02:35:34,309
your own grow room you should be able to

3487
02:35:31,248 --> 02:35:36,020
smell it in there this random grow tip

3488
02:35:34,309 --> 02:35:37,939
has been brought to you by I'm just

3489
02:35:36,020 --> 02:35:40,459
thinking about filtration and if we're

3490
02:35:37,939 --> 02:35:42,318
gonna grow indoors yeah I got a couple

3491
02:35:40,459 --> 02:35:43,310
carbon filters by the way we're gonna be

3492
02:35:42,318 --> 02:35:44,689
growing indoors and doing it right

3493
02:35:43,309 --> 02:35:46,128
that's that's how you know you're not

3494
02:35:44,689 --> 02:35:47,929
putting humidity and mildew problems

3495
02:35:46,129 --> 02:35:49,189
into the house and that's how you know

3496
02:35:47,929 --> 02:35:51,138
you're filtering it to your neighbors

3497
02:35:49,189 --> 02:35:53,359
aren't gonna complain I blew a guy's

3498
02:35:51,138 --> 02:35:56,809
mind the other day uh sold him into a

3499
02:35:53,359 --> 02:35:58,279
carbon filter for the intake when I

3500
02:35:56,809 --> 02:36:00,978
first told him about it he was like

3501
02:35:58,279 --> 02:36:01,399
sounds like a waste of money and with

3502
02:36:00,978 --> 02:36:06,648
him

3503
02:36:01,398 --> 02:36:09,259
45 seconds he was like oh so I did it

3504
02:36:06,648 --> 02:36:11,838
even like it makes your light bulbs last

3505
02:36:09,259 --> 02:36:14,509
longer I mean everything is just it's

3506
02:36:11,838 --> 02:36:16,699
better yeah yeah carbon filters guys

3507
02:36:14,509 --> 02:36:18,828
carbon scrubbers if you're not using it

3508
02:36:16,699 --> 02:36:20,810
to just pull they're out of the room

3509
02:36:18,828 --> 02:36:22,068
that you're growing in put a filter with

3510
02:36:20,809 --> 02:36:23,059
a blower in there just right in the

3511
02:36:22,068 --> 02:36:25,248
middle of the room either on the floor

3512
02:36:23,059 --> 02:36:26,809
or hanging a ceiling to keep their clean

3513
02:36:25,248 --> 02:36:28,248
and keep air moving you can't have too

3514
02:36:26,809 --> 02:36:30,528
much air flow in your grow room

3515
02:36:28,248 --> 02:36:32,418
you really can't random tips from some

3516
02:36:30,529 --> 02:36:36,469
pros need a and we have really good air

3517
02:36:32,418 --> 02:36:39,289
here to had everyone in town taking that

3518
02:36:36,468 --> 02:36:42,309
advice at the beginning of the summer we

3519
02:36:39,289 --> 02:36:45,549
would not be here recording this episode

3520
02:36:42,309 --> 02:36:47,958
really you know I'm an outdoor grower

3521
02:36:45,549 --> 02:36:50,569
it's hard to keep that stink away I

3522
02:36:47,959 --> 02:36:53,159
don't have a good same time have you

3523
02:36:50,568 --> 02:37:00,000
ever had a neighbor

3524
02:36:53,159 --> 02:37:03,450
no I've been in many backdoor or

3525
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:05,700
backyard gardens Jesus I've been in many

3526
02:37:03,450 --> 02:37:10,890
backyard get something on your mind that

3527
02:37:05,700 --> 02:37:12,560
kind of I haven't seen a lot of

3528
02:37:10,889 --> 02:37:15,529
pissed-off neighbors on either side

3529
02:37:12,559 --> 02:37:20,369
generally because unless you're doing it

3530
02:37:15,530 --> 02:37:21,439
in large quantities or you're really

3531
02:37:20,370 --> 02:37:24,240
good at it

3532
02:37:21,439 --> 02:37:26,670
you're not gonna produce a level of

3533
02:37:24,239 --> 02:37:29,969
stink that's there for more than two

3534
02:37:26,670 --> 02:37:32,370
weeks in any sort of obnoxious level I

3535
02:37:29,969 --> 02:37:33,929
mean we're not talking more than like

3536
02:37:32,370 --> 02:37:35,430
the [ __ ] from the guy next door

3537
02:37:33,930 --> 02:37:37,860
wasn't raked it up in a couple of weeks

3538
02:37:35,430 --> 02:37:41,220
or the compost pile that's baking in the

3539
02:37:37,860 --> 02:37:45,479
Sun type odor here it's not that strong

3540
02:37:41,219 --> 02:37:48,090
it's just peculiar and unless you're a

3541
02:37:45,478 --> 02:37:49,920
real dick your neighbors not gonna call

3542
02:37:48,090 --> 02:37:53,549
the cops and every member of City

3543
02:37:49,920 --> 02:37:56,100
Council instead of you those people that

3544
02:37:53,549 --> 02:37:57,929
claim just the smell of pot makes me

3545
02:37:56,100 --> 02:37:59,399
sick I get a headache and I think that's

3546
02:37:57,930 --> 02:38:00,960
[ __ ] because I've smelled some all

3547
02:37:59,398 --> 02:38:03,239
kinds of [ __ ] and no smells I've ever

3548
02:38:00,959 --> 02:38:05,250
really given me a headache just smelling

3549
02:38:03,239 --> 02:38:07,260
something probably that's but there are

3550
02:38:05,250 --> 02:38:10,709
some people that love to clean to a

3551
02:38:07,260 --> 02:38:13,590
problem or there's a lot of people

3552
02:38:10,709 --> 02:38:16,109

3556
02:38:20,040 --> 02:38:25,050
really you're hurting the cause man we

3557
02:38:23,040 --> 02:38:26,790
succeeded and we got full legalization

3558
02:38:25,049 --> 02:38:28,920
now we've got people looking to throw

3559
02:38:26,790 --> 02:38:32,970

3567
02:38:47,370 --> 02:38:52,670

greenhouse and put the greenhouse inside

3578
02:39:16,159 --> 02:39:20,478
the dog run but Blake seven out of ten

3579
02:39:19,040 --> 02:39:22,130
growers that have grown some outdoor pot

3580
02:39:20,478 --> 02:39:24,289
this year have either had caterpillars

3581
02:39:22,129 --> 02:39:26,869
or thieves in this neighborhood and I'm

3582
02:39:24,290 --> 02:39:28,670
just gonna pass on the outdoor one of

3583
02:39:26,870 --> 02:39:30,950
the things most people don't take into

3584
02:39:28,670 --> 02:39:34,520
account for the outdoor is you're giving

3585
02:39:30,950 --> 02:39:36,290
up like 90 percent of your control so

3586
02:39:34,520 --> 02:39:52,340
that you can also give up 90 percent of

3587
02:39:36,290 --> 02:39:53,990
your energy cause I mean I just grew a

3588
02:39:52,340 --> 02:39:56,600
bunch of veggies outdoor this year in

3589
02:39:53,989 --> 02:39:58,398
the weather bugs pretty much killed me

3590
02:39:56,600 --> 02:40:00,290
but I still got a massive harvest at do

3591
02:39:58,398 --> 02:40:02,028
you use old pot dirt to grow veggies I

3592
02:40:00,290 --> 02:40:05,270
know a bunch of growers that gave me two

3593
02:40:02,029 --> 02:40:07,520
trifles uh old pot dirt mix it with sand

3594
02:40:05,270 --> 02:40:09,380
so holds water a little better I mix it

3595
02:40:07,520 --> 02:40:12,229
with that clay crap Pablo is built on

3596

3607
02:40:44,998 --> 02:40:49,318
it's kind of a dietary decision but also

3608
02:40:47,248 --> 02:40:51,779
because eggs are disgusting

3609
02:40:49,318 --> 02:40:52,978

would ever bring up a pot ordinance

3672
02:43:27,940 --> 02:43:34,659
again if we had 80 people show up they

3673
02:43:31,239 --> 02:43:37,329
would do whatever we asked if we had

3674
02:43:34,659 --> 02:43:40,719
five people show up this ordinance would

3675
02:43:37,329 --> 02:43:42,219
never see the light of day with a public

3676
02:43:40,719 --> 02:43:44,500

think this is a terrible ordinance it's

3683
02:43:56,049 --> 02:44:01,000
unenforceable it's really bad for

3684
02:43:58,420 --> 02:44:05,170
pueblos there's no point don't do it and

3685
02:44:01,000 --> 02:44:06,879
we're not psychotic about it when they

3686
02:44:05,170 --> 02:44:09,399
present it on the 15th it'll get killed

3687
02:44:06,879 --> 02:44:10,569
immediately and it will never make it on

3688
02:44:09,399 --> 02:44:12,190
to the official agenda

3689
02:44:10,569 --> 02:44:14,979
it will never be voted on by City

3690
02:44:12,190 --> 02:44:17,680
Council it will die quickly if 30 or 40

3691
02:44:14,979 --> 02:44:21,399
of us show up we'll have the City

3692
02:44:17,680 --> 02:44:22,510
overlay for the retail stores shaken out

3693
02:44:21,399 --> 02:44:24,930

3694
02:44:22,510 --> 02:44:29,050

02:46:34,248 --> 02:46:37,578
I'm just gonna do it now because we've

3747
02:46:35,869 --> 02:46:39,918
got it going on because I want to ask my

3748
02:46:37,578 --> 02:46:42,529
listeners for one thing I need a theme

3749
02:46:39,918 --> 02:46:43,968
song I've been playing other artists

3750
02:46:42,529 --> 02:46:45,498
songs and I've been playing that one

3751
02:46:43,968 --> 02:46:47,929
reggae song you hear is it seem that I

3752
02:46:45,498 --> 02:46:48,478
made on iTunes it's not acceptable or on

3753
02:46:47,930 --> 02:46:50,220
garage man

3754
02:46:48,478 --> 02:46:52,828
sorry that's not acceptable if somebody

3755
02:46:50,219 --> 02:46:56,488
would make me a super cool theme about

3756
02:46:52,828 --> 02:46:59,010
two minutes long maybe see a few key

3757
02:46:56,488 --> 02:47:00,748
phrases agriculture podcast hosted by

3758
02:46:59,010 --> 02:47:03,719
Rasta Jeff brought to you by eye region

3759
02:47:00,748 --> 02:47:05,189
etics you know I would make it up to you

3760
02:47:03,719 --> 02:47:06,988
in some sort of way depending on what

3761
02:47:05,189 --> 02:47:08,699
state you live in and how old you are we

3762
02:47:06,988 --> 02:47:09,809
could work on a little compensation but

3763
02:47:08,699 --> 02:47:11,279
there would definitely be some pay in

3764
02:47:09,809 --> 02:47:12,748
there I'm not begging I just need a

3765
02:47:11,279 --> 02:47:15,270
theme song I'm tired of listening to

3766
02:47:12,748 --> 02:47:17,309
cheesy reggae tune I made and I've been

3767
02:47:15,270 --> 02:47:19,498
putting the show on you on YouTube and

3768
02:47:17,309 --> 02:47:21,478
YouTube gets mad at me for using all

3769
02:47:19,498 --> 02:47:22,889
those other people's songs I've got

3770
02:47:21,478 --> 02:47:24,389
their written permission all the artists

3771
02:47:22,889 --> 02:47:26,309
that I use I've got permission proving

3772
02:47:24,389 --> 02:47:27,568
that to Google's tricky exactly they

3773
02:47:26,309 --> 02:47:28,618
don't even care if you do prove it

3774
02:47:27,568 --> 02:47:30,118
they're like that email doesn't mean

3775
02:47:28,619 --> 02:47:32,248
[ __ ] to us we need a written letter from

3776
02:47:30,119 --> 02:47:34,819
a record label with notary and yeah

3777
02:47:32,248 --> 02:47:36,689
sorry dude have fun we'll call us

3778
02:47:34,818 --> 02:47:38,340
artists I'm using are actually my

3779
02:47:36,689 --> 02:47:39,630
friends it's like mystic roots and tasks

3780
02:47:38,340 --> 02:47:41,309
rock and I've been like hey can I use

3781
02:47:39,629 --> 02:47:42,748
your music like yeah of course bro so

3782
02:47:41,309 --> 02:47:44,788
there's like you know they've said yes

3783
02:47:42,748 --> 02:47:46,170
but that's as far as we've gotten yeah

3784
02:47:44,789 --> 02:47:48,149
you can't play Google that voicemail

3785
02:47:46,170 --> 02:47:49,978
that's right so somebody if you want to

3786
02:47:48,148 --> 02:47:51,118
write I like reggae obviously if you

3787
02:47:49,978 --> 02:47:53,010
wanted to write a couple of them that'd

3788
02:47:51,119 --> 02:47:54,899
be badass maybe one for the start of the

3789
02:47:53,010 --> 02:47:56,988
show one for the end of the show maybe a

3790
02:47:54,898 --> 02:47:58,680
short piece for like between segments

3791
02:47:56,988 --> 02:48:00,389
something with the real aggressive

3792
02:47:58,680 --> 02:48:02,130
dancehall reggae beat would be pretty

3793
02:48:00,389 --> 02:48:03,358
smooth I don't know I'm just begging at

3794
02:48:02,129 --> 02:48:04,828
this point I could use a theme song

3795
02:48:03,359 --> 02:48:11,010
that's what I'm trying to get at he also

3796
02:48:04,828 --> 02:48:12,328
likes death metal there's nothing like

3797
02:48:11,010 --> 02:48:14,130
getting real high just listening to a

3798
02:48:12,328 --> 02:48:27,828
thousand

3799
02:48:14,129 --> 02:48:27,828
[Music]

3800

3801
02:48:33,940 --> 02:48:39,101
compensated in some way or another

3802
02:48:36,870 --> 02:48:40,841

3803

3814

4021
02:56:47,109 --> 02:56:50,318
every time I say the f-word because I'm

4022
02:56:49,209 --> 02:56:53,619

4104
02:59:45,209 --> 02:59:48,779

4105
02:59:47,340 --> 02:59:53,340

and they're like no dude you need I can

4107
02:59:53,340 --> 02:59:58,290
feel the same thing snowboarding as well

4108
02:59:56,180 --> 03:00:00,450
be on a snowboard it's like trying to

4109
02:59:58,290 --> 03:00:06,061
put a telephone pole on a snowboard it's

4110
03:00:00,450 --> 03:00:08,521
just a lot of me rolling down it I do

4111
03:00:06,060 --> 03:00:12,090
but I spend more time on the lift and on

4112
03:00:08,521 --> 03:00:13,650
my ass than I do on the actual board the

4113
03:00:12,090 --> 03:00:16,200
left-knee disagrees with the snowboard

4114
03:00:13,649 --> 03:00:17,879
now it feels like feels like my left

4115
03:00:16,200 --> 03:00:19,950
knee wants to fly out of the socket the

4116
03:00:17,879 --> 03:00:28,920
entire time I'm strapped in but I can't

4117
03:00:19,950 --> 03:00:30,420
ski for that this winter case-to-case my

4118
03:00:28,920 --> 03:00:32,879
snowboard friends have moved away miss

4119
03:00:30,420 --> 03:00:34,620
you guys hope you're listening so weird

4120
03:00:32,879 --> 03:00:36,719
to talk about curing herb not talking

4121
03:00:34,620 --> 03:00:38,130
about curing ourselves actually during

4122
03:00:36,719 --> 03:00:40,019
herbal cure ourselves I'm talking into a

4123
03:00:38,129 --> 03:00:44,670
circle because I'm really dab doubt

4124
03:00:40,020 --> 03:00:46,859

4125
03:00:44,670 --> 03:00:48,869

4126
03:00:46,859 --> 03:00:50,220
regular rig the you know couldn't keep

4127
03:00:48,869 --> 03:00:51,689
up with the puddles we were putting on

4128
03:00:50,219 --> 03:00:53,788
it and I think it took a [ __ ] today so

4129
03:00:51,689 --> 03:00:55,710
hey giddyup remember what you're telling

4130
03:00:53,789 --> 03:00:57,930
me I shout out to giddyup I ran into

4131
03:00:55,709 --> 03:00:59,429
giddy on chatroulette that was amazing

4132
03:00:57,930 --> 03:01:00,238
and you said something about sending me

4133
03:00:59,430 --> 03:01:01,920
a G nail homey

4134
03:01:00,238 --> 03:01:04,618
don't forget cuz my nail just took a

4135
03:01:01,920 --> 03:01:05,670
[ __ ] so that'd be great timing um we

4136
03:01:04,619 --> 03:01:07,619
want to cure some weed that's why

4137
03:01:05,670 --> 03:01:08,789
everybody's listening you doing good bro

4138
03:01:07,619 --> 03:01:09,989
by the way I just kind of skipped right

4139
03:01:08,789 --> 03:01:11,159
over introduce for sure you'd have a

4140
03:01:09,988 --> 03:01:14,038
good day you look like you're working

4141
03:01:11,158 --> 03:01:15,750
hard tendon is very very sick some dads

4142
03:01:14,039 --> 03:01:19,920
take break what record will be awesome

4143
03:01:15,750 --> 03:01:21,238
so if you're gonna cure some weed you're

4144
03:01:19,920 --> 03:01:23,219
gonna need a few things you should have

4145
03:01:21,238 --> 03:01:25,260
a dehumidifier maybe you should have an

4146
03:01:23,219 --> 03:01:28,500
air conditioner maybe you for sure need

4147
03:01:25,260 --> 03:01:30,898
fans at least one fan you need what I

4148
03:01:28,500 --> 03:01:33,119
call a hydrometer that say it's a

4149
03:01:30,898 --> 03:01:35,250
thermometer with a humidity reading on

4150
03:01:33,119 --> 03:01:38,100
it also then you're gonna need some kind

4151
03:01:35,250 --> 03:01:39,840
of jars I prefer glass mason jars if

4152
03:01:38,100 --> 03:01:41,158
you're going a little bigger there's a

4153
03:01:39,840 --> 03:01:43,350
company I think it's called quick back

4154
03:01:41,158 --> 03:01:44,699
there a little suction fact live jars

4155
03:01:43,350 --> 03:01:45,960
they sell them at most of the head shops

4156
03:01:44,699 --> 03:01:47,069
those are pretty chill to cure your weed

4157
03:01:45,959 --> 03:01:49,198
and a lot of people don't like them

4158
03:01:47,068 --> 03:01:50,818
because those are plastic I don't think

4159
03:01:49,199 --> 03:01:53,460
they leave any taste or smell those

4160
03:01:50,818 --> 03:01:56,129
don't if you're going bigger I like to

4161
03:01:53,459 --> 03:01:57,719
buy those Rubbermaid 32 quart containers

4162
03:01:56,129 --> 03:01:59,908
I think that's what it is it's a big

4163
03:01:57,719 --> 03:02:02,398
container it's like a two handed

4164
03:01:59,908 --> 03:02:03,600
container you can fit a lot of herb in

4165
03:02:02,398 --> 03:02:04,858
one of those to cure it those work

4166
03:02:03,600 --> 03:02:07,939
perfectly so you're gonna need something

4167
03:02:04,859 --> 03:02:11,970
to cure it in and a room to get it

4168
03:02:07,939 --> 03:02:15,090
started to cure it ed Rosenthal actually

4169
03:02:11,969 --> 03:02:18,379
taught me that curing begins at the

4170
03:02:15,090 --> 03:02:21,210
start of harvest I'm not sure how much I

4171
03:02:18,379 --> 03:02:22,349
subscribe to Ed's teaching but in a

4172
03:02:21,209 --> 03:02:23,818
sense that is accurate

4173
03:02:22,350 --> 03:02:25,408
the minute you cut down that plant

4174
03:02:23,818 --> 03:02:29,519
you're starting the curing process you

4175
03:02:25,408 --> 03:02:32,398
need that herb to dry uniformly not too

4176
03:02:29,520 --> 03:02:33,689
fast not too slow and you don't want it

4177
03:02:32,398 --> 03:02:34,449
in a hot room you don't want it in a

4178
03:02:33,689 --> 03:02:37,390
cool room

4179
03:02:34,450 --> 03:02:38,800
so we're gonna kind of go from and one

4180
03:02:37,390 --> 03:02:40,539
of our lessons before we talked from

4181
03:02:38,799 --> 03:02:43,329
where we talked about harvest and drying

4182
03:02:40,540 --> 03:02:45,400
and we ended drawing as when where the

4183
03:02:43,329 --> 03:02:47,200
sticks on your buds that's pretty much

4184
03:02:45,399 --> 03:02:48,760
where we decided we were entering cure

4185
03:02:47,200 --> 03:02:52,329
so if you've done everything right

4186
03:02:48,760 --> 03:02:54,489
you've got all your leaves off your buds

4187
03:02:52,329 --> 03:02:55,840
have dried evenly in a nice room that

4188
03:02:54,489 --> 03:02:57,399
was temperature controlled not too fast

4189
03:02:55,840 --> 03:02:59,440
not too cool and now the sticks are

4190
03:02:57,399 --> 03:03:01,989
snapping and the buds are a little bit

4191
03:02:59,440 --> 03:03:03,880
damp a little bit juicy if you squeeze

4192
03:03:01,989 --> 03:03:05,199
them they kind of stick to your fingers

4193
03:03:03,879 --> 03:03:06,520
but they kind of spring back to life

4194
03:03:05,200 --> 03:03:09,159
they don't you don't crush them when you

4195
03:03:06,521 --> 03:03:11,260
squeeze them you wanted to have a little

4196
03:03:09,159 --> 03:03:13,659
spring left into it for sure all right

4197
03:03:11,260 --> 03:03:18,370
so I guess I should really and don't be

4198
03:03:13,659 --> 03:03:19,719
deceived by the crunchy layer some I

4199
03:03:18,370 --> 03:03:21,431
guess it goes strain to strain but

4200
03:03:19,719 --> 03:03:25,719
sometimes there's a lot more leaf on the

4201
03:03:21,431 --> 03:03:27,159
outside well yeah you know that's the

4202
03:03:25,719 --> 03:03:29,799
way you could get tricked either way you

4203
03:03:27,159 --> 03:03:33,340
know for sure if I letting it over dry

4204
03:03:29,799 --> 03:03:37,060
and also by taking this dry too soon so

4205
03:03:33,340 --> 03:03:39,219
right the weed dries from the outside or

4206
03:03:37,060 --> 03:03:40,690
from the outside in so even though the

4207
03:03:39,219 --> 03:03:43,329
outside leaves are crispy and dry the

4208
03:03:40,690 --> 03:03:47,351
inside could be really juicy still so

4209
03:03:43,329 --> 03:03:51,760
you got to be careful little buds or go

4210
03:03:47,351 --> 03:03:54,420
to dry quicker than the big buds when I

4211
03:03:51,760 --> 03:03:56,950
grow big but actually cut that all down

4212
03:03:54,420 --> 03:03:58,569
ball size nuggets if you if you're one

4213
03:03:56,950 --> 03:04:00,820
of my patients usually get a bagful of

4214
03:03:58,569 --> 03:04:02,739
golf balls is what I give you I do and

4215
03:04:00,819 --> 03:04:06,250
uh when I'm doing like the final trim

4216
03:04:02,739 --> 03:04:08,079
okay sometimes when they're hanging you

4217
03:04:06,250 --> 03:04:11,190
know the bigger butts are a little

4218
03:04:08,079 --> 03:04:13,271
harder to break down sometimes so

4219
03:04:11,190 --> 03:04:14,829
nothing to do with them yeah you don't

4220
03:04:13,271 --> 03:04:16,750
want to put them on a rack yeah let em

4221
03:04:14,829 --> 03:04:18,159
hang okay all right before we before

4222
03:04:16,750 --> 03:04:19,840
we're gonna cure this is when the sticks

4223
03:04:18,159 --> 03:04:21,159
will pop so everything's all trimmed up

4224
03:04:19,840 --> 03:04:23,110
now we don't have any leaves left

4225
03:04:21,159 --> 03:04:25,030
they look pretty they're manicured the

4226
03:04:23,110 --> 03:04:26,141
way you want when you grab one of the

4227
03:04:25,030 --> 03:04:27,909
buds you pick it up and you bend the

4228
03:04:26,140 --> 03:04:29,529
stick it should snap you don't want it

4229
03:04:27,909 --> 03:04:31,510
to bend like a straw you want it to

4230
03:04:29,530 --> 03:04:32,950
actually break pop you don't want to

4231
03:04:31,510 --> 03:04:35,040
leave it until it like explodes and

4232
03:04:32,950 --> 03:04:38,351
breaks cuz then you're a little too dry

4233
03:04:35,040 --> 03:04:40,570
too dry or too wet of cannabis will not

4234
03:04:38,351 --> 03:04:42,370
cure properly if you're too dry you've

4235
03:04:40,569 --> 03:04:43,899
already missed your point you're gonna

4236
03:04:42,370 --> 03:04:44,609
get stale buds you're just gonna put in

4237
03:04:43,899 --> 03:04:46,619
the jar waste

4238
03:04:44,609 --> 03:04:48,120
if you're too wet and you try to cure it

4239
03:04:46,620 --> 03:04:51,210
you're actually going to print but

4240
03:04:48,120 --> 03:04:52,740
promote mold so you want it about right

4241
03:04:51,209 --> 03:04:54,858
where those sticks snap and that's when

4242
03:04:52,739 --> 03:04:57,420
you're going to start the curing process

4243
03:04:54,859 --> 03:04:59,880
let me read you what I wrote of what

4244
03:04:57,420 --> 03:05:02,040
curing actually is and what the per the

4245
03:04:59,879 --> 03:05:03,089
purpose of curing is this is what I just

4246
03:05:02,040 --> 03:05:05,880
what I wrote down to give an actual

4247
03:05:03,090 --> 03:05:08,250
reason curing is used to remove excess

4248
03:05:05,879 --> 03:05:10,379
moisture to convert complex sure to

4249
03:05:08,250 --> 03:05:12,840
convert complex carbs back into sugars

4250
03:05:10,379 --> 03:05:15,029
while removing chlorophyll chlorophyll

4251
03:05:12,840 --> 03:05:17,100
is green pigment and chlorophyll makes

4252
03:05:15,030 --> 03:05:19,380
your buds taste harsh and smell bad and

4253
03:05:17,100 --> 03:05:21,899
it also makes your buds burn pork if you

4254
03:05:19,379 --> 03:05:22,889
guys ever smoked herb that kind of maybe

4255
03:05:21,898 --> 03:05:24,599
tastes like you just stuck your tongue

4256
03:05:22,889 --> 03:05:26,129
in a white socket you just want to

4257
03:05:24,600 --> 03:05:28,590
scrape your tongue off or you need a

4258
03:05:26,129 --> 03:05:30,629
drink real bad that stuff was not dried

4259
03:05:28,590 --> 03:05:35,909
and cured properly probably not flushed

4260
03:05:30,629 --> 03:05:38,309
properly either also as THC drives the

4261
03:05:35,909 --> 03:05:40,799
THC dries in your buds if it dries more

4262
03:05:38,309 --> 03:05:42,629
slowly there's more slower it loses its

4263
03:05:40,799 --> 03:05:44,670
water moisture it's a more psychoactive

4264
03:05:42,629 --> 03:05:46,920
it will become once the water comes out

4265
03:05:44,670 --> 03:05:49,139
of that THC that's when it's ripe and

4266
03:05:46,920 --> 03:05:51,180
nice and primed for you to smoke so by

4267
03:05:49,139 --> 03:05:52,858
curing it you slowly let that happen and

4268
03:05:51,180 --> 03:05:57,329
you don't destroy the THC you don't

4269
03:05:52,859 --> 03:05:59,850
destroy your terpenes essentially curing

4270
03:05:57,329 --> 03:06:01,379
allows aerobic bacteria to consume the

4271
03:05:59,850 --> 03:06:04,950
chlorophyll in the plants chlorophyll is

4272
03:06:01,379 --> 03:06:06,179
what we want to remove bacteria sounds

4273
03:06:04,950 --> 03:06:08,310
like a bad thing it's actually a good

4274
03:06:06,180 --> 03:06:11,398
thing in this instance aerobic bacteria

4275
03:06:08,309 --> 03:06:14,459
is made from air light and moisture

4276
03:06:11,398 --> 03:06:17,449
being sealed inside of that jar so what

4277
03:06:14,459 --> 03:06:20,849
I do I actually take my buds that snap I

4278
03:06:17,450 --> 03:06:22,290
fill my mason jar about 90% of the way

4279
03:06:20,850 --> 03:06:23,579
fool I don't want to squish him in there

4280
03:06:22,290 --> 03:06:27,960
I just want to lightly set him in there

4281
03:06:23,579 --> 03:06:30,239
then I seal that jar as soon as that jar

4282
03:06:27,959 --> 03:06:32,849
is sealed the aerobic bacteria begins to

4283
03:06:30,239 --> 03:06:34,409
form and that aerobic bacteria will

4284
03:06:32,850 --> 03:06:38,220
start eating away the chlorophyll in

4285
03:06:34,409 --> 03:06:41,909
there so when you open that jar that's

4286
03:06:38,219 --> 03:06:44,519
when the reaction will restart so what

4287
03:06:41,909 --> 03:06:47,010
you want to do what I do is I put the

4288
03:06:44,520 --> 03:06:49,439
buds in the jar I seal it up and then I

4289
03:06:47,010 --> 03:06:51,960
wait about two hours and then I go open

4290
03:06:49,439 --> 03:06:54,210
the jar and that first time I'll pour

4291
03:06:51,959 --> 03:06:55,289
the buds out onto my little tray and I

4292
03:06:54,209 --> 03:06:56,549
want to feel the buds and make sure

4293
03:06:55,290 --> 03:06:57,700
they're not they haven't gotten really

4294
03:06:56,549 --> 03:07:00,699
moist or they haven't

4295
03:06:57,700 --> 03:07:01,601
if you can see sweat inside the jar get

4296
03:07:00,700 --> 03:07:03,280
him out of there immediately

4297
03:07:01,601 --> 03:07:06,641
you [ __ ] up get him out of there right

4298
03:07:03,280 --> 03:07:07,989
away take him out of the jar nice start

4299
03:07:06,640 --> 03:07:09,909
squeezing him and I want to feel a

4300
03:07:07,989 --> 03:07:11,530
little bit of moisture at the edge cuz

4301
03:07:09,909 --> 03:07:13,569
it's coming out of the middle on the

4302
03:07:11,530 --> 03:07:14,800
surface but I don't want him to be damp

4303
03:07:13,569 --> 03:07:16,629
and sticky to where I'm afraid they're

4304
03:07:14,799 --> 03:07:18,699
gonna get mold so I'll leave them out

4305
03:07:16,629 --> 03:07:19,779
this first time I dumped them out and

4306
03:07:18,700 --> 03:07:21,040
check them all out I leave them sitting

4307
03:07:19,780 --> 03:07:22,780
out for a couple minutes if I feel like

4308
03:07:21,040 --> 03:07:25,740
they need it then I'll put them back in

4309
03:07:22,780 --> 03:07:28,090
the jar and seal that jar off if they're

4310
03:07:25,739 --> 03:07:29,920
properly dry like I'm hoping they are at

4311
03:07:28,090 --> 03:07:31,479
this point I'll leave it closed for four

4312
03:07:29,920 --> 03:07:33,610
hours this time and I know this sounds

4313
03:07:31,479 --> 03:07:35,379
tedious but this is where this is what

4314
03:07:33,610 --> 03:07:36,970
separates the pros from the regular

4315
03:07:35,379 --> 03:07:39,819
growers this is where you get that super

4316
03:07:36,969 --> 03:07:41,049
high-grade cured cannabis that's enough

4317
03:07:39,819 --> 03:07:43,299
you're getting at the dispensary that

4318
03:07:41,049 --> 03:07:44,529
tastes kind of hay like and I don't mean

4319
03:07:43,299 --> 03:07:47,109
to call out the shops but they don't

4320
03:07:44,530 --> 03:07:49,840
have time or space or manpower or the

4321
03:07:47,110 --> 03:07:51,730
patience to cure herb your caregiver or

4322
03:07:49,840 --> 03:07:54,399
your private grower or you are the only

4323
03:07:51,729 --> 03:07:56,199
way you're gonna get good cured herb the

4324
03:07:54,399 --> 03:07:57,579
dispensaries not gonna do it it tastes

4325
03:07:56,200 --> 03:07:59,771
you can taste the nutrients you can

4326
03:07:57,579 --> 03:08:01,390
taste the leaves you can taste whatever

4327
03:07:59,771 --> 03:08:03,311
other plant it was growing next to or

4328
03:08:01,390 --> 03:08:05,170
hang it next to in the dry room you can

4329
03:08:03,310 --> 03:08:07,750
taste that in these dispensary buds in

4330
03:08:05,170 --> 03:08:09,431
my opinion there are very few shops that

4331
03:08:07,750 --> 03:08:11,860
are actually curing their herb in my

4332
03:08:09,431 --> 03:08:13,090
opinion I don't work there so I can't

4333
03:08:11,860 --> 03:08:15,190
tell you what they're doing I thought

4334
03:08:13,090 --> 03:08:17,890
you're gonna say this for very few shops

4335
03:08:15,190 --> 03:08:27,130
flushing their stuff back to that to

4336
03:08:17,890 --> 03:08:28,270
adhering it well where I was you gotta

4337
03:08:27,129 --> 03:08:29,649
put your put your buds back in the jar

4338
03:08:28,271 --> 03:08:32,800
you seal the jar you wait for hours

4339
03:08:29,649 --> 03:08:34,029
that's when I open it again and then I

4340
03:08:32,799 --> 03:08:36,489
want to check the buds and make sure

4341
03:08:34,030 --> 03:08:38,170
that they're not getting too much

4342
03:08:36,489 --> 03:08:39,909
moisture is not coming out of there if I

4343
03:08:38,170 --> 03:08:42,909
feel like it's really humid inside of

4344
03:08:39,909 --> 03:08:45,459
the jar I said humid if it's not too

4345
03:08:42,909 --> 03:08:47,110
humid inside of the jar I'll put them

4346
03:08:45,459 --> 03:08:49,569
back in there seal it up and let them

4347
03:08:47,110 --> 03:08:51,040
sit for like six hours I've pretty much

4348
03:08:49,569 --> 03:08:52,569
increased the time just by a couple

4349
03:08:51,040 --> 03:08:54,970
hours until I get to about twelve hours

4350
03:08:52,569 --> 03:08:57,940
and then once you're checking them twice

4351
03:08:54,969 --> 03:08:59,709
a day so I'll do six hours and then I'll

4352
03:08:57,940 --> 03:09:01,060
do like ten hours and then I'll wait

4353
03:08:59,709 --> 03:09:02,709
till about twelve hours and then I'll

4354
03:09:01,060 --> 03:09:04,270
usually open them like every morning

4355
03:09:02,709 --> 03:09:06,250
when I wake up and then right before I

4356
03:09:04,271 --> 03:09:08,141
go to bed that's about 12 hours usually

4357
03:09:06,250 --> 03:09:09,640
in my world so you pop open the jar make

4358
03:09:08,140 --> 03:09:10,789
sure it's not too moist let it sit open

4359
03:09:09,640 --> 03:09:11,750
for just like ten Rafi

4360
03:09:10,790 --> 03:09:13,820
fifteen minutes you just want to

4361
03:09:11,750 --> 03:09:16,610
exchange the air and then seal it back

4362
03:09:13,819 --> 03:09:19,010
up and let it sit there once you've got

4363
03:09:16,610 --> 03:09:21,260
it to a point where you know it's not

4364
03:09:19,010 --> 03:09:22,909
gonna get any mold in it that's what I

4365
03:09:21,260 --> 03:09:30,290
like to just seal it up and leave it I

4366
03:09:22,909 --> 03:09:35,000
won't open it anymore it should burn

4367
03:09:30,290 --> 03:09:36,620
nice and smooth and that you can tell I

4368
03:09:35,000 --> 03:09:38,209
don't know if you guys have ever had

4369
03:09:36,620 --> 03:09:41,420
perfectly cured or if it's hard to get

4370
03:09:38,209 --> 03:09:42,919
honestly very but it you know that you

4371
03:09:41,420 --> 03:09:45,440
can smell down the block you're going oh

4372
03:09:42,920 --> 03:09:48,049
man that stuff was slowly dried and

4373
03:09:45,440 --> 03:09:49,909
cured I let all of the chlorophyll sneak

4374
03:09:48,049 --> 03:09:51,709
out and it let all of the flavor that

4375
03:09:49,909 --> 03:09:53,569
should have been there when the

4376
03:09:51,709 --> 03:09:55,129
chlorophyll disappears that's when the

4377
03:09:53,569 --> 03:09:56,809
other colors the Reds and the purples

4378
03:09:55,129 --> 03:09:58,189
start popping up and you can see in

4379
03:09:56,809 --> 03:10:00,979
those that's what gives you really

4380
03:09:58,190 --> 03:10:03,380
pretty buds and that's when the THC is

4381
03:10:00,979 --> 03:10:06,139
allowed to dry slowly that's when it

4382
03:10:03,379 --> 03:10:07,939
becomes more psychoactive I'm not

4383
03:10:06,139 --> 03:10:09,289
completely sure about the terpenoids but

4384
03:10:07,940 --> 03:10:10,880
it sounds like we need to give these

4385
03:10:09,290 --> 03:10:12,380
terpenoids a little bit of time to cure

4386
03:10:10,879 --> 03:10:15,170
they're also so they're not getting

4387
03:10:12,379 --> 03:10:16,670
destroyed or taken out along with the

4388
03:10:15,170 --> 03:10:18,440
chlorophyll or with the moisture if we

4389
03:10:16,670 --> 03:10:19,639
let it go slowly I think we're making it

4390
03:10:18,440 --> 03:10:22,280
smell better because we're doing

4391
03:10:19,639 --> 03:10:24,229
something to the terms and from what I

4392
03:10:22,280 --> 03:10:28,190
know about them they seem very fragile

4393
03:10:24,229 --> 03:10:30,139
too so this is you know mild to moderate

4394
03:10:28,190 --> 03:10:32,780
temperatures in darkness I think are all

4395
03:10:30,139 --> 03:10:34,029
very key to this I think I read that

4396
03:10:32,780 --> 03:10:38,390
terpenoids

4397
03:10:34,030 --> 03:10:40,550
evaporate at approximately 85 degrees we

4398
03:10:38,389 --> 03:10:42,289
read on another on another episode about

4399
03:10:40,549 --> 03:10:44,689
a hundred and six degrees was I think

4400
03:10:42,290 --> 03:10:46,340
where we said so I think it's right

4401
03:10:44,690 --> 03:10:47,870
around 100 degrees and something here

4402
03:10:46,340 --> 03:10:51,969
guys is drying and curing rooms or

4403
03:10:47,870 --> 03:10:51,970
getting that hot excuse me I need a sip

4404
03:10:52,299 --> 03:10:54,739
nice all those dad's got me all dried

4405
03:10:54,559 --> 03:10:56,959
out

4406
03:10:54,739 --> 03:10:59,079
thirsty dude we took some monster dad's

4407
03:10:56,959 --> 03:11:02,659
before the show that was pretty killer

4408
03:10:59,079 --> 03:11:05,659
so you need to keep opening those jars

4409
03:11:02,659 --> 03:11:08,090
until you're confident that it's not

4410
03:11:05,659 --> 03:11:10,100
going to mold up in there you want a

4411
03:11:08,090 --> 03:11:12,440
little bit of moisture Kyle kushman

4412
03:11:10,100 --> 03:11:14,030
prefers a bud he likes to open his jar

4413
03:11:12,440 --> 03:11:15,620
and take out a couple of nugs and set

4414
03:11:14,030 --> 03:11:17,150
him on the table and he would have sat

4415
03:11:15,620 --> 03:11:18,590
here and talked for 20 minutes before he

4416
03:11:17,149 --> 03:11:19,909
would have been able to roll him up he

4417
03:11:18,590 --> 03:11:20,860
would had to give you a lecture about

4418
03:11:19,909 --> 03:11:23,379
beginnings

4419
03:11:20,860 --> 03:11:26,050
and then after that the bud would be

4420
03:11:23,379 --> 03:11:27,459
almost dry enough to roll hump

4421
03:11:26,049 --> 03:11:29,979
sorry Kyle I'm just picking on your

4422
03:11:27,459 --> 03:11:32,379
brother great but so Kyle likes his buds

4423
03:11:29,979 --> 03:11:34,119
a little more moist our buddy Adam will

4424
03:11:32,379 --> 03:11:36,009
take a nicely dried and cured bud that

4425
03:11:34,120 --> 03:11:38,561
I've given him and he'll set that [ __ ]

4426
03:11:36,010 --> 03:11:39,940
out all day until it's crispy drive and

4427
03:11:38,560 --> 03:11:46,750
he grinds it up in the grind retorts

4428
03:11:39,940 --> 03:11:49,149
dust and takes heroic sighs bonk it but

4429
03:11:46,750 --> 03:11:51,760
what you want to do is I like to get it

4430
03:11:49,149 --> 03:11:53,260
to where it's it's not fluffy but it's a

4431
03:11:51,760 --> 03:11:54,790
it's got some squishy to it so if you've

4432
03:11:53,260 --> 03:11:56,170
got a nice hard den snug you want to be

4433
03:11:54,790 --> 03:11:58,150
able to give it a squeeze and it just

4434
03:11:56,170 --> 03:12:00,129
pops back up you don't want to crush it

4435
03:11:58,149 --> 03:12:02,299
and you don't want dust you definitely

4436
03:12:00,129 --> 03:12:04,560
don't I don't want that dry dusty buds

4437
03:12:02,299 --> 03:12:06,639
[Music]

4438
03:12:04,560 --> 03:12:10,840
how long do you try to store your

4439
03:12:06,639 --> 03:12:15,989
cannabis some of it gets stored for up

4440
03:12:10,840 --> 03:12:18,340
to nine months I suppose xenoverse stuff

4441
03:12:15,989 --> 03:12:20,799
some of my patients I can give them

4442
03:12:18,340 --> 03:12:22,120
their whole year supply at once and

4443
03:12:20,799 --> 03:12:25,000
they're fine with it

4444
03:12:22,120 --> 03:12:28,900
some of my other patients asked me to

4445
03:12:25,000 --> 03:12:30,639
hold on to it for anything you know some

4446
03:12:28,899 --> 03:12:32,979
of them on Endor but throughout the year

4447
03:12:30,639 --> 03:12:36,670
so you know it's all a balance but yeah

4448
03:12:32,979 --> 03:12:38,760
okay the last couple years my stuff

4449
03:12:36,670 --> 03:12:41,710
that's got nine ten months so it just

4450
03:12:38,760 --> 03:12:44,229
really wasn't happy with it

4451
03:12:41,709 --> 03:12:46,179
by the time it was that age let's uh

4452
03:12:44,229 --> 03:12:48,250
let's work on curing a little better and

4453
03:12:46,180 --> 03:12:51,700
I bet if those buds will store longer I

4454
03:12:48,250 --> 03:12:53,771
think I messed up in the beginning I do

4455
03:12:51,700 --> 03:12:56,950
pretty much you what you do for the

4456
03:12:53,771 --> 03:13:00,159
2-hour pull it out of the jar then the

4457
03:12:56,950 --> 03:13:03,311
4-hour but then it normally it'll go 24

4458
03:13:00,159 --> 03:13:05,139
hours 18 hours before I need it again

4459
03:13:03,310 --> 03:13:08,229
you gotta set some alarms I've got my

4460
03:13:05,139 --> 03:13:10,000
iPhone full of alarms just ridiculous

4461
03:13:08,229 --> 03:13:11,500
beeps if people think I'm doing

4462
03:13:10,000 --> 03:13:13,271
something crazy is every two hours I got

4463
03:13:11,500 --> 03:13:15,399
to run away I'll be back dude and got to

4464
03:13:13,271 --> 03:13:17,079
go somewhere go pop open a bunch of jars

4465
03:13:15,399 --> 03:13:18,909
and then go back and get them for sure

4466
03:13:17,079 --> 03:13:21,039
if you're using larger batches I guess I

4467
03:13:18,909 --> 03:13:23,340
should have covered this what I like to

4468
03:13:21,040 --> 03:13:25,300
do is get one of those big like purple

4469
03:13:23,340 --> 03:13:27,819
Tupperware containers or Rubbermaid

4470
03:13:25,299 --> 03:13:29,170
containers fill that up with your you

4471
03:13:27,819 --> 03:13:31,719
can leave it on the sticks a little bit

4472
03:13:29,170 --> 03:13:32,859
if you have to it's easier

4473
03:13:31,719 --> 03:13:36,129
right off the stick for this curing

4474
03:13:32,859 --> 03:13:37,930
process fill those containers and then I

4475
03:13:36,129 --> 03:13:39,849
actually flip them upside down and take

4476
03:13:37,930 --> 03:13:41,648
the container off the lid instead of

4477
03:13:39,850 --> 03:13:44,500
taking the lid off the container seal

4478
03:13:41,648 --> 03:13:46,028
even more exposed area and then just pop

4479
03:13:44,500 --> 03:13:47,529
that container back onto the lid try not

4480
03:13:46,029 --> 03:13:49,420
to squish any buds I hope that makes

4481
03:13:47,529 --> 03:13:50,680
sense pop it open lift the container off

4482
03:13:49,420 --> 03:13:53,318
the lid sit there like a tray full of

4483
03:13:50,680 --> 03:13:55,238
buds for sure yeah that gets a lot of

4484
03:13:53,318 --> 03:13:57,459
airflow in there yeah I like to use

4485
03:13:55,238 --> 03:14:01,029
those actually those same ones that

4486
03:13:57,459 --> 03:14:04,419
first same simiiar size but they're like

4487
03:14:01,029 --> 03:14:06,640
the size of a brownie pan yeah those

4488
03:14:04,420 --> 03:14:08,680
work for a short-term storage pretty

4489
03:14:06,639 --> 03:14:10,750
good okay in the beginning I talked

4490
03:14:08,680 --> 03:14:13,809
about we should have a dehumidifier and

4491
03:14:10,750 --> 03:14:15,879
AC unit fans a hydrometer I'm gonna back

4492
03:14:13,809 --> 03:14:18,689
up and talk a little bit about how Edie

4493
03:14:15,879 --> 03:14:21,519
Rosenthal says curing starts and harvest

4494
03:14:18,689 --> 03:14:26,790
hold on I got one thing let's do it I

4495
03:14:21,520 --> 03:14:32,920
like it how you packed your jar yeah I

4496
03:14:26,790 --> 03:14:35,140
don't like to over pack it mmm learning

4497
03:14:32,920 --> 03:14:38,889
but I think there's a lot of validity to

4498
03:14:35,139 --> 03:14:42,219
it yeah I think we need to over pack it

4499
03:14:38,889 --> 03:14:44,920
you create you know possible different

4500
03:14:42,219 --> 03:14:47,438
little microclimates in there you almost

4501
03:14:44,920 --> 03:14:48,728
prevent the aerobic acid from being able

4502
03:14:47,439 --> 03:14:50,738
to form in there when you don't have

4503
03:14:48,728 --> 03:14:53,079
enough oxygen for sure what creates

4504
03:14:50,738 --> 03:14:55,420
aerobic acid I think I said before was

4505
03:14:53,079 --> 03:14:58,600
oxygen light and moisture and so we need

4506
03:14:55,420 --> 03:14:59,680
plenty of that air in there Thanks don't

4507
03:14:58,600 --> 03:15:01,149
worry about giving it why you guys a

4508
03:14:59,680 --> 03:15:02,470
little bit of light we'll start it off

4509
03:15:01,148 --> 03:15:08,019
and once you get it started it's going

4510
03:15:02,469 --> 03:15:09,429
I'm fixing the echoes in here there's a

4511
03:15:08,020 --> 03:15:10,720
fan that we're fighting with but I'm

4512
03:15:09,430 --> 03:15:15,370
gonna make it happen I think I got it

4513
03:15:10,719 --> 03:15:16,959
just there sweet all right so like I

4514
03:15:15,370 --> 03:15:18,910
said II D Rosenthal says that curing

4515
03:15:16,959 --> 03:15:21,250
starts from pretty much when you cut it

4516
03:15:18,909 --> 03:15:23,020
down so if your buds have gotten too dry

4517
03:15:21,250 --> 03:15:25,719
they're not gonna cure they're gonna

4518
03:15:23,020 --> 03:15:27,069
crumble if your buds are too moist you

4519
03:15:25,719 --> 03:15:29,920
still have a chance but hopefully they

4520
03:15:27,068 --> 03:15:31,719
didn't dry too quickly you got to cut

4521
03:15:29,920 --> 03:15:33,189
down the plant and get all those leaves

4522
03:15:31,719 --> 03:15:34,510
off and let it dry nice and slowly

4523
03:15:33,189 --> 03:15:36,279
that's why we're talking about a room

4524
03:15:34,510 --> 03:15:37,750
with a dehumidifier with an air

4525
03:15:36,279 --> 03:15:38,200
conditioner and some fans and a high

4526
03:15:37,750 --> 03:15:41,530
drama

4527
03:15:38,200 --> 03:15:44,909
you want to keep your plants between 60

4528
03:15:41,530 --> 03:15:47,440
and 75 degrees at about 50% humidity

4529
03:15:44,909 --> 03:15:50,159
until you put them in this jar until

4530
03:15:47,440 --> 03:15:53,050
they reach that stick snap in period

4531
03:15:50,159 --> 03:15:55,239
that's how you keep from not drying too

4532
03:15:53,049 --> 03:15:57,819
fast I had a guy that a long time ago I

4533
03:15:55,239 --> 03:16:04,271
used to have to buy some herb and this

4534
03:15:57,819 --> 03:16:05,709
guy usually had the greatest bud anymore

4535
03:16:04,271 --> 03:16:06,970
that LA Confidential do you have any

4536
03:16:05,709 --> 03:16:08,409
more of that LA Confidential and he

4537
03:16:06,969 --> 03:16:10,000
didn't and he kept telling me I

4538
03:16:08,409 --> 03:16:11,530
harvested it it's almost ready I

4539
03:16:10,000 --> 03:16:14,021
harvested it's almost ready and I was

4540
03:16:11,530 --> 03:16:15,101
getting eager and so I asked him and

4541
03:16:14,021 --> 03:16:16,750
he's like sure man I'll bring it to you

4542
03:16:15,101 --> 03:16:19,870
tonight and he brought it to me and it

4543
03:16:16,750 --> 03:16:22,870
was it was a really weird texture it

4544
03:16:19,870 --> 03:16:24,820
felt like a pine cone it was hard but it

4545
03:16:22,870 --> 03:16:26,681
was also squeezy but the outside was

4546
03:16:24,819 --> 03:16:28,209
really hard then he broke it open in the

4547
03:16:26,681 --> 03:16:30,190
middle was soft and it was kind of

4548
03:16:28,209 --> 03:16:31,600
fluffy on the inside so I immediately

4549
03:16:30,190 --> 03:16:34,000
called him was like what the hell

4550
03:16:31,601 --> 03:16:36,190
happened bro and he said that he dried

4551
03:16:34,000 --> 03:16:37,840
it by opening the oven and setting it

4552
03:16:36,190 --> 03:16:41,230
next to the oven so that it would dry it

4553
03:16:37,840 --> 03:16:43,989
out on yeah so that is a prime example

4554
03:16:41,229 --> 03:16:45,729
of what not to do to dry your herb I

4555
03:16:43,989 --> 03:16:47,440
could taste it you smell it

4556
03:16:45,729 --> 03:16:49,930
I mean the weed smell like spaghetti

4557
03:16:47,440 --> 03:16:51,579
sauce like you smelled like marinara for

4558
03:16:49,931 --> 03:16:53,200
some reason it was the first thing that

4559
03:16:51,579 --> 03:16:56,469
came to mind that's gonna kill all the

4560
03:16:53,200 --> 03:16:58,710
Turks yeah yeah some sort of tomato we

4561
03:16:56,469 --> 03:17:02,350
paste or something it was terrible

4562
03:16:58,709 --> 03:17:04,109
better dried properly and slowly you

4563
03:17:02,351 --> 03:17:06,130
don't want to dry it up too fast

4564
03:17:04,110 --> 03:17:07,450
anything to add to curing bro I feel

4565
03:17:06,129 --> 03:17:11,459
like we went over that really super

4566
03:17:07,450 --> 03:17:17,159
quickly yeah um just really stoned me to

4567
03:17:11,459 --> 03:17:20,879
reject a lot of my spots II need crowns

4568
03:17:17,159 --> 03:17:23,728
so the dehumidifier they see you

4569
03:17:20,879 --> 03:17:26,488
and the hygrometer you need that

4570
03:17:23,728 --> 03:17:28,019
regardless of where you're at yeah you

4571
03:17:26,488 --> 03:17:29,520
gotta keep you need a proper room for

4572
03:17:28,020 --> 03:17:31,079
drying a lot of guys are just throwing

4573
03:17:29,520 --> 03:17:33,930
it in a closet or something you need a

4574
03:17:31,079 --> 03:17:35,969
good area for drying I'm gonna keep the

4575
03:17:33,930 --> 03:17:38,220
air moving the reason for a dehumidifier

4576
03:17:35,969 --> 03:17:40,079
what we're trying to do is we are

4577
03:17:38,219 --> 03:17:41,670
pulling water out of these plants that

4578
03:17:40,079 --> 03:17:43,469
water ends up in the atmosphere around

4579
03:17:41,670 --> 03:17:44,908
your plants and it has nowhere to go so

4580
03:17:43,469 --> 03:17:47,010
you gotta suck that water out of there

4581
03:17:44,908 --> 03:17:49,469
the dehumidifier is a perfect place for

4582
03:17:47,010 --> 03:17:51,449
that water to go and you can reuse that

4583
03:17:49,469 --> 03:17:52,379
water to water your plants later oh yeah

4584
03:17:51,449 --> 03:17:56,819
that's good water

4585
03:17:52,379 --> 03:18:00,209
yeah however I dunno if you if say

4586
03:17:56,818 --> 03:18:05,039
you're drying not a lot of plants in a

4587
03:18:00,209 --> 03:18:07,318
large room in the southwest you might

4588
03:18:05,040 --> 03:18:09,449
actually want a humidifier to help slow

4589
03:18:07,318 --> 03:18:11,818
things down right I'm trying to you know

4590
03:18:09,449 --> 03:18:12,569
kind of help out people regionally yeah

4591
03:18:11,818 --> 03:18:14,340
that's a good idea

4592
03:18:12,568 --> 03:18:18,000
we're kind of talking about Colorado but

4593
03:18:14,340 --> 03:18:19,619
yeah you need to keep about sixty to

4594
03:18:18,000 --> 03:18:22,529
seventy-five degrees that cool actually

4595
03:18:19,619 --> 03:18:24,899
I think will make your buds dry a little

4596
03:18:22,529 --> 03:18:26,699
more dense I think it hardens them up a

4597
03:18:24,898 --> 03:18:29,129
little bit also I got to mention dark

4598
03:18:26,699 --> 03:18:30,600
you want that dry room dark yeah drying

4599
03:18:29,129 --> 03:18:33,719
and curing should happen in mostly a

4600
03:18:30,600 --> 03:18:35,369
dark area I feel like literally a room

4601
03:18:33,719 --> 03:18:38,519
exact to same climates

4602
03:18:35,369 --> 03:18:40,619
when this dark an one that's light the

4603
03:18:38,520 --> 03:18:44,399
room with lights got a plastic out dry

4604
03:18:40,619 --> 03:18:46,199
faster it's kind of EF just kind of

4605
03:18:44,398 --> 03:18:50,549
experienced a half with my dry room and

4606
03:18:46,199 --> 03:18:54,329
keeping a window open sometimes and and

4607
03:18:50,549 --> 03:18:55,679
I know nothing else changed it is gonna

4608
03:18:54,329 --> 03:18:57,209
take a little bit of practice to get

4609
03:18:55,680 --> 03:19:00,840
your drying and curing method down right

4610
03:18:57,209 --> 03:19:03,209
you may have to ruin a jar or to seal

4611
03:19:00,840 --> 03:19:04,949
that jar up go to sleep open it the next

4612
03:19:03,209 --> 03:19:06,929
day and you open it it smells like

4613
03:19:04,949 --> 03:19:08,489
ammonia you might have just kind of

4614
03:19:06,930 --> 03:19:10,439
killed that crop if it's not moldy if

4615
03:19:08,488 --> 03:19:11,969
you don't see any mold break it open as

4616
03:19:10,439 --> 03:19:14,850
small as you can get those buds pour it

4617
03:19:11,969 --> 03:19:16,318
out on a tray let it dry taste it give

4618
03:19:14,850 --> 03:19:17,609
it a smoke see if it tastes all right it

4619
03:19:16,318 --> 03:19:19,228
might be all right it might be smokeable

4620
03:19:17,609 --> 03:19:21,840
if you left it in there too long and it

4621
03:19:19,228 --> 03:19:23,789
mold it up throw it away remember what

4622
03:19:21,840 --> 03:19:26,340
you did fix it next time don't do that

4623
03:19:23,790 --> 03:19:28,920
same [ __ ] again yeah always start with

4624
03:19:26,340 --> 03:19:31,500
clean jars clean jars yeah

4625
03:19:28,920 --> 03:19:33,840
I spend a lot of time today cleaning

4626
03:19:31,500 --> 03:19:37,829
jars and thinking man this really sucks

4627
03:19:33,840 --> 03:19:39,750
this isn't you know but it's you know be

4628
03:19:37,829 --> 03:19:41,309
every little thing counts has anybody

4629
03:19:39,750 --> 03:19:43,079
tried to cut off their feet and stick

4630
03:19:41,309 --> 03:19:51,719
cloning gel on their ankles so that we

4631
03:19:43,079 --> 03:19:54,209
can do the growing work you gotta do

4632
03:19:51,719 --> 03:19:56,129
life and then you gotta clean up after

4633
03:19:54,209 --> 03:19:57,419
yourself and that's always the part that

4634
03:19:56,129 --> 03:19:59,429
gets skipped in then you gotta go start

4635
03:19:57,420 --> 03:20:00,629
by cleaning tomorrow hey guys keep your

4636
03:19:59,430 --> 03:20:02,460
girl rooms clean cuz it builds up

4637
03:20:00,629 --> 03:20:04,469
quickly then you gotta clone yourself

4638
03:20:02,459 --> 03:20:07,889
cuz you just can't keep everything going

4639
03:20:04,469 --> 03:20:10,949
thank you - um you would crush yeah yeah

4640
03:20:07,889 --> 03:20:13,769
if you have a lot of money and you'd

4641
03:20:10,950 --> 03:21:14,060
have no shame and you wanna clean pots

4642
03:20:13,770 --> 03:21:14,060
and scrub floors and with us yeah yeah I

4643
03:21:16,489 --> 03:21:21,360
feel like we've covered curing I don't

4644
03:21:19,290 --> 03:21:22,530
know what else to add to this you're

4645
03:21:21,360 --> 03:21:24,600
gonna mess up some stuff that's where I

4646
03:21:22,530 --> 03:21:25,800
was it takes prick practice and patience

4647
03:21:24,600 --> 03:21:26,100
you're not gonna get it right the first

4648
03:21:25,799 --> 03:21:31,379
time

4649
03:21:26,100 --> 03:21:34,380
yeah what you can do is go you can open

4650
03:21:31,379 --> 03:21:36,569
it too often that's a good thing

4651
03:21:34,379 --> 03:21:38,459
leaving it close to long will screw you

4652
03:21:36,569 --> 03:21:41,340
up so go there and open it if you think

4653
03:21:38,459 --> 03:21:42,719
maybe I need to open it do if you have

4654
03:21:41,340 --> 03:21:44,159
another jar next to it don't open not

4655
03:21:42,719 --> 03:21:46,019
want to just kind of compare take notes

4656
03:21:44,159 --> 03:21:48,299
that's the best way to become a good

4657
03:21:46,020 --> 03:21:50,729
grower and a good sure and dryer is

4658
03:21:48,299 --> 03:21:55,009
divide practice it and take notes what's

4659
03:21:50,728 --> 03:21:55,010
your thoughts on rehydrating trade

4660
03:21:57,290 --> 03:22:02,340
company book the humidity the humidity

4661
03:21:59,790 --> 03:22:04,470
ex worked great for rehydrating your

4662
03:22:02,340 --> 03:22:06,680
buds been wondering what they'd be like

4663
03:22:04,469 --> 03:22:09,000
for long-term long-term storage as well

4664
03:22:06,680 --> 03:22:11,040
I've seen a lot of people throw their

4665
03:22:09,000 --> 03:22:11,850
herb in a sea vault which doesn't

4666
03:22:11,040 --> 03:22:13,260
sponsor me either

4667
03:22:11,850 --> 03:22:26,610
with a couple of human impacts and leave

4668
03:22:13,260 --> 03:22:28,020
it for a really long time yeah that'll

4669
03:22:26,610 --> 03:22:34,350
make your stuff not taste right it

4670
03:22:28,020 --> 03:22:37,670
doesn't it'll be funky flavor

4671
03:22:34,350 --> 03:22:37,670
unfortunately it doesn't work that way

4672
03:22:38,079 --> 03:22:43,500
[Music]

4673
03:22:39,530 --> 03:22:46,530
curing herb that you've possibly

4674
03:22:43,500 --> 03:22:48,629
purchased from someone you know just

4675
03:22:46,530 --> 03:22:50,760
trying to help out listeners here you

4676
03:22:48,629 --> 03:22:53,938
know ask them so if you've gotten herb

4677
03:22:50,760 --> 03:22:55,950
that you don't feel is dry enough if

4678
03:22:53,939 --> 03:22:58,139
you've got some patience you can cure it

4679
03:22:55,950 --> 03:23:00,510
if it's sticky you can leave it in the

4680
03:22:58,139 --> 03:23:02,250
jar and let it let it kind of dry real

4681
03:23:00,510 --> 03:23:02,610
slowly in the jar leave it in there

4682
03:23:02,250 --> 03:23:04,200
overnight

4683
03:23:02,610 --> 03:23:05,819
open it up check on in the morning and

4684
03:23:04,200 --> 03:23:07,890
leave it open for like 15 minutes and

4685
03:23:05,819 --> 03:23:09,659
just repeat that every day until it's

4686
03:23:07,889 --> 03:23:13,519
good or open it every six hours and

4687
03:23:09,659 --> 03:23:13,520
check on it if you're impatient yeah

4688
03:23:13,790 --> 03:23:18,240
brown paper sacks are great because they

4689
03:23:16,649 --> 03:23:20,250
kind of I did this when I was just

4690
03:23:18,239 --> 03:23:21,780
starting I kind of think that they kind

4691
03:23:20,250 --> 03:23:24,959
of make a little bit of a flavor in my

4692
03:23:21,780 --> 03:23:26,790
buds now and I've also lost a nice

4693
03:23:24,959 --> 03:23:29,039
amount of weed a whole brown paper

4694
03:23:26,790 --> 03:23:31,320
sandwich bag to mold I feel like it's

4695
03:23:29,040 --> 03:23:33,770
the mold process I kind of feel like

4696
03:23:31,319 --> 03:23:33,770
they may

4697
03:23:33,931 --> 03:23:39,630
very true but if you can time it right

4698
03:23:36,719 --> 03:23:42,810
it's a great step between the hanging

4699
03:23:39,629 --> 03:23:44,219
process and the jar it's that one if you

4700
03:23:42,810 --> 03:23:45,899
have to leave it out for if you've got

4701
03:23:44,219 --> 03:23:47,729
to be a way at work all day but you know

4702
03:23:45,899 --> 03:23:49,560
it should be in the jar but it's not dry

4703
03:23:47,729 --> 03:23:50,579
enough for the jar that bag is probably

4704
03:23:49,560 --> 03:23:54,989
gonna work for you

4705
03:23:50,579 --> 03:23:56,760
there's a company ideal for someone come

4706
03:23:54,989 --> 03:24:00,440
up with a brown paper sack that doesn't

4707
03:23:56,760 --> 03:24:00,440
have all those issues we just mentioned

4708
03:24:01,790 --> 03:24:11,330

4709

doesn't seem that - I just prefer I

4711
03:24:13,649 --> 03:24:18,810

4712
03:24:15,450 --> 03:24:22,771

people yell at City Council before

4768
03:26:31,290 --> 03:26:35,070

03:26:56,969 --> 03:27:00,659
spokesperson he'll sign up and he

4779
03:26:58,859 --> 03:27:03,600
definitely will speak hopefully after he

4780
03:27:00,659 --> 03:27:04,709
speaks they just denied the thing what

4781
03:27:03,600 --> 03:27:06,000
they're looking for hasn't even been

4782
03:27:04,709 --> 03:27:07,289
submitted to or what they're talking

4783
03:27:06,000 --> 03:27:11,100
about hasn't been shown to them yeah

4784
03:27:07,290 --> 03:27:15,630
we're gonna preempted this maybe we

4785
03:27:11,100 --> 03:27:16,979
shouldn't do all 60 of us sitting there

4786
03:27:15,629 --> 03:27:18,509
at the City Council meeting telling them

4787
03:27:16,978 --> 03:27:20,699
why it sucks they'll just go okay you're

4788
03:27:18,510 --> 03:27:24,000

4789
03:27:20,700 --> 03:27:25,260
sometimes especially on Tuesday after a
