a blend of headbanger

33
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,359
and han solo burger the flavor is

34
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,079
described as garlic

35
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,599
cookies and sour i think i agree with

36
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:09,118
that when i crack open the jar i'm

37
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:10,239
punched in the face with a pungent

38
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:12,159
garlic aroma

39
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:14,319
when i take a dab i get that garlic

40
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,040
aroma on the exhale i get a little bit

41
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:16,719
of sour

42
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,640
and then as it sits on my tongue i do

43
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:19,359
get a little bit of sweet cookies and

44
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,759
garlic

45
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:23,519
on my tongue as an aftertaste so i find

46
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,959

led talk

96
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,360
i need to mention music somebody has

97
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:54,799
asked me to post a list of the songs

98
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,680
which i have played at the end of the

99
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,280
podcast

100
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,040
i'm going to update that and i will post

101
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,800
that to social media so you guys can get

102
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:02,158
a good list of the songs i've played

103
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,439
though if you've enjoyed some of those

104
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:04,318
tracks you can download them you can

105
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:06,079
listen to them

106
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:07,839
hopefully you support those artists the

107
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,360
music industry is a pain in the ass

108
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,200
show some love to the artists that i

109
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,720
introduce you to you probably already

110
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:14,158
know who half of them are but there will

111
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:15,680
be some reggae bands in there that are

112
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:18,318
slightly obscure to some of you

113
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,760
so i will post that list something i'm

114
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:20,238
going to have to do in the future is

115
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:22,079
stop

116
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,599
putting in other people's music if i

117
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,760
want the podcast to grow

118
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:26,639
if i want it playable on other platforms

119
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:28,318
i want it to

120
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:29,759
expand i'm going to have to quit using

121
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:31,518
copyrighted music

122
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:32,878
every time i put somebody else's music

123
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,480
in the show i do get a

124
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:36,000
copyright notice from youtube they

125
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:37,518
aren't mad about it but i think over

126
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,080
time eventually they'll say hey you've

127
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,360
used

128
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,719
500 uh of 500 instances of somebody

129
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,159
else's songs we're gonna have to [ __ ]

130
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:46,000
with you for that eventually

131
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:47,439
it may limit me in growing down the

132
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,519
future so i'm going to

133
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:51,359
shy away from using other people's music

134
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,480
in the future probably another 10 or 12

135
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,319
episodes before we can

136
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:55,919
uh stop doing that we can get away with

137
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:57,359
it but if i want the show to grow it's

138
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:58,958
something i need to do and i would like

139
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,640
the show to grow i'd like to make the

140
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,158
video show uh go further i'd like to

141
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:03,759
make the audio show go further some

142
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:04,479
platforms will not take it with other

143
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:06,639
music

144
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:08,878
so uh the short version of this story is

145
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:09,679
if you are a producer if you make music

146
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:11,840
out there

147
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,719
i would like a short intro track just

148
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,039
about something

149
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:16,079
uh 30 45 maybe a minute and a half at

150
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:18,238
the longest

151
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,600
uh of course you know i like reggae i'd

152
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:21,039
like something that kicks in the door

153
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,560
with a big fat beat

154
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,000
uh something that lets you know you're

155
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,319
listening to the grow from your heart

156
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,560

cannabis community

159
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:33,758
um stay positive in the [ __ ] wording

160
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:35,839
if you put words in there

161
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,280
um reggae is best you know i like reggae

162

i'm picky when it comes to music

167
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,040
especially if i'm paying you for it

168
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,319
uh if you'd like to trade for seeds

169
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,040
that's always an option if you'd like to

170
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:51,439
be paid in

171
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,800
cash or paypal that is always an option

172
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:54,240
if you're a producer out there doing

173
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,919
music doing production

174
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,600
especially some some sort of a reggae

175
00:04:55,918 --> 00:04:58,560
project let me know i'd love to get some

176
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,759
music on the show

177
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:05,038
the catch is it has got to be 100

178
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:06,160
original music i can't use a remix i

179
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:07,918
can't use a dub

180
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,000
i can't use anything that has ever been

181
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:12,240
put on youtube or copyrighted

182
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,680
before it's got to be for me you can

183
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,439
copyright it but you've got to give me

184
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,560
the rights to that music it is mine once

185
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:17,839
i buy it from you

186
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,680
i guess that means i own the copyright

187
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:21,198
right so i'll be copyrighting it but

188
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,199
what happens is once somebody puts a

189
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,120
track on youtube youtube

190
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,800
has an algorithm that can find that

191
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,800
track and any other music

192
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,319
especially popular [ __ ] so if i put an

193
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,919
obscure song on there it takes him a

194
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:33,279
couple of days to flag me if i put a

195
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:34,879
popular song on there the minute that

196
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:36,239
[ __ ] uploads youtube goes hey

197
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:38,159
you just played metallica we know

198
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,079
metallica real well you can't do that

199
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,600
so it has to be something that has never

200
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:43,279
been heard by youtube something that has

201
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,919
never been copyrighted played in a video

202
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:45,679
before

203
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:47,120

led talk you guys holy [ __ ]

225
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,280
i have been very hesitant to switch over

226
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:21,758
to led lighting a lot of people tell me

227
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:23,519
led

228
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,120
is the way it's more effective it's more

229
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:27,120
efficient it's more affordable

230
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,199
uh the plants seem they say the plants

231
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,000
seem to like it i am a commercial grower

232
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,680
i'm known

233
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,079
my reputation is for running commercial

234
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,800
grows and also for being a breeder

235
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:38,000
in a commercial environment i rely on

236
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,600
numbers and we're going to talk about

237
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,839
numbers in the future but i rely on

238
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,160
weights and potency and scheduling

239
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:46,079
and i know that the double-ended gavita

240
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,360
lights the double-ended hps lights which

241
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:48,240
i've been using in a commercial

242
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,400
production

243
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,280
they hit all of the numbers i need i

244
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:53,519
don't know that

245
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:56,879
i would ever switch my commercial grow

246
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:58,560
away from double ended hps bulbs

247
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:00,000
in talking with a few friends they've

248
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,079
convinced me to give

249
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,918
led lighting a try i've made good

250
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:05,519
friends with a guy who owns an led

251
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:07,120
company shout out to my buddy keith

252
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:08,879
keith and i were talking and he said bro

253
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,959
why don't you run a couple of these leds

254
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:14,000
in a tent and let me know what you think

255
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:16,079
he honestly gave me two canon

256
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,279
lights from black sail market so i've

257
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:19,918
got two cannons from black sail in a 5x5

258
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:22,000
tent

259
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:23,758
i've been running them for um i'm

260
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,399
looking at the date i'm going to say

261
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:28,240
uh all of april and most of may uh most

262
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:29,519
of april and all of may i messed that up

263
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,400
but they've been going for almost two

264
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:33,198
months now

265
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:33,679
and i'm honestly completely impressed

266
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,680
with

267
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,879
the growth that i am seeing from these

268
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,959
led lights

269
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:40,879
i was really hesitant to spend money on

270
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:42,560
them and change my setup but when

271
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:44,240
somebody gave me two of them i put a

272
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,839
tent in a spare room i put some lights

273
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,280
some plants some seedlings under there

274
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:49,279
my tongue is tied up today but we'll get

275
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:50,799
a podcast going don't worry guys i put

276
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:53,119
plants under the lights is the way that

277
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,400
worked um and they've been growing for a

278
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,598
while and i am seeing

279
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:59,679
amazing growth i also put a cloner

280
00:07:57,598 --> 00:08:00,959
on the peripheral edge of that tent it

281
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,720
was outside of the tent just

282
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:05,038
on the outside of the tent on a little

283
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,280
uh little table and those clones rooted

284
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:08,478
super quickly they loved that led

285
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:10,399
lighting so the clones

286
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:11,758
showed me right away when i cut clones

287
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:13,279
they never drooped they never did

288
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,919
anything weird they went into an easy

289
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:15,839
cloner

290
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:17,198
there was at the edge of the tent and

291
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:18,959
that light from that uh

292
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,800
cannon light at the middle of the tent

293
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:21,279
shone out enough to make those clones

294
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,960
grow

295
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:24,719
super happily they never drooped they

296
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:26,239
never skipped a beat that told me

297
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,759
something right away

298
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,680
i've been watching the plants that i put

299
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:32,399
in there grow they're staying

300
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,120
super short and super squat the node

301
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,360
spacing

302
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,719
is super tight most of the time i would

303
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,479
get i'm going to guess about an

304
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,320
inch between nodes and right now we're

305
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,519
about a half maybe three quarters of an

306
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,000
inch between nodes

307
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:46,639
so normally i would veg under t5

308
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,360
lighting was my go-to lighting for veg

309
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:49,759
i've edged under leds and i see much

310
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,480
more

311
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:54,559
rapid growth i see much more nodes

312
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,959
tighter node spacing i see more

313
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:58,319
branching so i've got my node spacing my

314
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:59,838
branches are growing out and off of

315
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,399
those branches i am getting

316
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:04,080
more shoots the plants are in veg they

317
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,360
are still what i would consider small

318
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,519
plants i have had to

319
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,039
defoliate them two times and i've

320
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,440
bottomed and cleaned them up because

321
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:12,958
they are so bushy and so branchy

322
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,480
that they would survive the way they are

323
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:15,439
but being a commercial cultivator i like

324
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,440
to go in and take off

325
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,959
excessive leaves and excessive branches

326
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,640
that makes my plants grow

327
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:23,039
more at the top it encourages growth to

328
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:24,000
the top excuse me it also allows for

329
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:25,278
more airflow

330
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,519
throughout the canopy throughout the

331
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:29,679
plants so i did some defoliating because

332
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,519
these leds are making the plants grow

333
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:33,199
rapidly i'm not used to this fast of

334
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:36,000
growth in my bedroom so

335
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,680
i think i'm really impressed um they're

336
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,399
growing faster they're growing very

337
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:40,239
healthy

338
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,000
they are eating like a champion i've

339
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,000
noticed that i don't see any nutrient

340
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,600
burn and i am feeding the [ __ ] out of

341
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,360
these plants usually by now

342
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,800
uh what i call getting the nails done

343
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,320
the little tips of the leaves would have

344
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:51,838
browned up a little bit that is not

345
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,560
happening to these plants i think they

346
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,920
love it

347
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:58,399
also uh it is not as hot i replaced

348
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:58,958
a so in that normal room there would be

349
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,440
a

350
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:03,039
600 or a thousand watt hbs depending on

351
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,640
the season in the summer i would run the

352
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:06,240
six in the winter i'd run the thousand

353
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:07,759
that's just things we do in colorado to

354
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,440
adjust it's colder in the winter run

355
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:10,720
that thousand keep the house warm

356
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,399
uh it gets a little bit hotter in the

357
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,800
summer take that thousand out put a six

358
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,078
in there

359
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:16,719
so we don't have to compete with it as

360
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:17,759
much but so in flour i would have a

361
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,480
thousand in there

362
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:21,838
and veg or a six in veg i would have two

363
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,200
t5s in there

364
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:27,680
right now i've got two 320 watt canon

365
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,200
leds from black sail and the room is not

366
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:30,399
too hot i don't have any air

367
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,240
conditioning running i don't have a

368
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,600
swamp cooler running i've just got the

369
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,839
lights running in the room with the

370
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,519
ambient uh airflow from the house

371
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,880
and the air exchange i've got a fan

372
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,320
blowing the air out of the room so that

373
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:41,600
we get a little air exchange

374
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,519
other than that there's no special

375
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,920
arrangements and it is not too hot in

376
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,000
there

377
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:47,199
the plants really seem to be thriving

378
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,559
they're not stretching

379
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,399
they're not doing anything weird they're

380
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:53,518
not having any nutrient deficiencies

381
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:56,000
i think i am impressed with led lighting

382
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,039
especially these canon leds from our

383
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,879
friends at blacksail

384
00:10:57,039 --> 00:11:00,159
they did not pay me to say this keith

385
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:01,679
does not know this podcast

386
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:03,199
is happening right now i'm just so

387
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:04,479
excited about the lights that i wanted

388
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,278
to honestly come on here

389
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,959
and talk about it with you guys the part

390
00:11:07,278 --> 00:11:10,879
i really wanted to talk about

391
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:13,599
that was kind of a setup it made me

392
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:15,759
think about by watching these plants

393
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,600
they're growing differently than my

394
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:19,039
plants in the past have grown because of

395
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,399
the lighting i've got brand new

396
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:22,559
seedlings in there that i've never grown

397
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,360
before plus i've also got familiar

398
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:24,958
plants in there

399
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,879
that i'm very familiar with which i've

400
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:28,879
grown lots of times for

401
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:30,559
years 10 years some of them three years

402
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:32,799
others some of them are not as old but

403
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:34,319
i'm familiar with them

404
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:35,679
i'm seeing different growth i'm seeing

405
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,959
different leaf shapes i'm seeing

406
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:38,559
different structures

407
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:40,319
not completely different but as a

408
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:42,159
breeder i am noticing differences the

409
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,480
plants are squattier they're not

410
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:46,719
uh branching the branches aren't as long

411
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,039
the apical tops the dominant tops aren't

412
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,278
as

413
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:50,799
uh dominant they're not as ridiculous

414
00:11:49,278 --> 00:11:51,919
everything is staying a little bit

415
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:53,838
shorter and tighter

416
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:55,439
the canopy is more even without as much

417
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:59,120
manipulation

418
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:01,440
i am wondering uh if i would have chosen

419
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,120
different phenotypes in all of my

420
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,639
selections in the past if i had been

421
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,639
growing with led lighting

422
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,240
i may have seen different traits i may

423
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:09,680
have seen different features i may have

424
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,039
seen different colors i may

425
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:12,799
i haven't flowered under these lights

426
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:13,838
yet i may discover that i'm getting

427
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:15,679
different aromas

428
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,360
i may have discovered that i'm getting

429
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:18,239
different buzzes from these finished

430
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,959
flowers

431
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,399
i'm wondering uh if i've been growing

432
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:23,759
under leds maybe

433
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,600
my breeding would have gone different

434
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:26,958
directions i'm wondering if my growing

435
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,600
would have gone a completely different

436
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:29,518
direction

437
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,959
had i been using led lighting in the

438
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,320
past because my plants are acting

439
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:34,078
completely different

440
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,079
was there a phenotype in the past they

441
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:37,919
got too stretchy that i eliminated

442
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:39,199
but maybe under these led lights it

443
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:40,799
would have stayed nice and squat and it

444
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,320
would have been a [ __ ] champion

445
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:44,240
that's just some weird path that my

446
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,760
brain went down did i select

447
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,959
wrong plants i know i didn't select

448
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:48,159
wrong plants you guys are breeding with

449
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:49,359
them you guys are growing them i'm

450
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:50,799
having fun you're having fun they're

451
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,399
definitely successful

452
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:54,000
but it's got me second guessing

453
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,919
selections now it's got me

454
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,399
wondering like did we make mistakes in

455
00:12:55,919 --> 00:13:00,159
the past it's also got me thinking about

456
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,759
going back and getting old batches of

457
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:04,159
seeds and growing them

458
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:04,879
and looking through them again to see

459
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:06,719
let's just take

460
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:08,559
a rise for an example you guys know i've

461
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,480
grown tons of rye seeds i grew up

462
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:11,919
probably 500 seeds looking for king

463
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,000
solomon just for that male

464
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:16,559
so i got to see 500 different plants of

465
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,480
that grow what if i grow 500 more under

466
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:21,359
leds am i going to see different [ __ ]

467
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,839
i probably am just that one variation is

468
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,800
going to

469
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:27,040
give me such different [ __ ] so keep that

470
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:28,479
puts me down a lot of other paths

471
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:31,199
keep that in mind when you're shopping

472
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,720
for seeds uh most of my stuff i send out

473
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,000
to a lot of people and let them test it

474
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,399
so we get to see what it does

475
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,120
under leds under hps under ceramic metal

476
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,120
halides

477
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,720
under t5s we also get to see some

478
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,480
experimental [ __ ] that crazy people do

479
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,160
out there and i love it keep doing that

480
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,399
but keep in mind you're going to get

481
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:47,278
different results i say when i grow it i

482
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,120
get this

483
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:51,838
but until now i've been growing under

484
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,560
hps's now that i'm growing under leds i

485
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,199
may

486
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:56,559
my flavor profiles may expand i may see

487
00:13:55,198 --> 00:13:58,479
completely different things

488
00:13:56,559 --> 00:13:59,599
out of my breeding out of my growing

489
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,360
this may change

490
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,800
a lot for me and keep that in mind when

491
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,039
you're selecting that what i have said

492
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:05,919
is based on my hps lights i do use

493
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:07,599
feedback from

494
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:09,599
a lot of other growers i've got testers

495
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,720
i've got friends they're they all get

496
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,639
the seeds they grow them

497
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,160
i use their input but obviously my

498
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:16,000
descriptions and things are mostly from

499
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:16,799
what i discover because i can rely on

500
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,159
myself

501
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:19,759
when three people say it tastes like

502
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:21,278
strawberries the word strawberries goes

503
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:22,720
into the description if one guy says it

504
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:24,240
tastes like a dog fart i don't put the

505
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,160
word dog fart in the description

506
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,919
if six people said dog fart that goes in

507
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:29,519
the description but ultimately i make

508
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:31,519
the description decisions

509
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,639
um so keep that kind of stuff in mind

510
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,159
you guys i was just kind of

511
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,759
i thought it was really profound i had a

512
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:37,120
lot of deep thought maybe i was baked

513
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:38,720
but i was sitting there thinking man was

514
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,560
i [ __ ] up for all these years

515
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,320
growing under hbss and selecting

516
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:44,078
differently making a switch really

517
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,680
triggered thoughts in my brain then

518
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:46,319
there's another path that my brain went

519
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:49,519
down

520
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:51,440
um i'm gonna call them our forefathers

521
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,639
the guys before me the guys before them

522
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,480
and the guys before them

523
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,879
the guys that were growing cannabis in

524
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,320
the 60s and or 70s i don't know exactly

525
00:14:56,879 --> 00:14:59,120
when people started doing home grows

526
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,720
around here

527
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,879
but in the states when people started

528
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,959
doing home grows we were very limited on

529
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:06,799
equipment we didn't have a growth store

530
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:08,958
what was a grow light nobody was growing

531
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:10,559
indoors so we didn't have a grow light

532
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:11,838
and if you had access to a grow light

533
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:13,039
you weren't going to go buy it because

534
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:14,480
people would say what the [ __ ] are you

535
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:15,519
doing with the grow light

536
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,199
they would expect you to have a

537
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,799
greenhouse or show up with tomatoes or

538
00:15:17,198 --> 00:15:19,838
cucumbers in a few weeks and that shit's

539
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:21,759
not going to happen

540
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:23,360
so there were no grow lights back in the

541
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:25,759
day also

542
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,480
there weren't websites with very

543
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:28,559
detailed

544
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,079
strain descriptions and seeds available

545
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:32,719
for people to work with so

546
00:15:30,078 --> 00:15:33,120
people back in the day were very limited

547
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,240
on

548
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:38,720
equipment uh products and everything

549
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,320
everything knowledge especially but they

550
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,240
were relying on

551
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,680
the lighting they had a lot of people i

552
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,278
know older growers that would tell us

553
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:46,559
about stealing street lights or older

554
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:47,759
growers they would talk about stealing

555
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:49,359
the lights at the gym

556
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:51,278
they were using whatever lights were

557
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,079
available to them and experimenting they

558
00:15:51,278 --> 00:15:53,919
didn't know

559
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:55,278
that certain colors would do certain

560
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:55,599
things to the plants they didn't know

561
00:15:55,278 --> 00:15:57,120
that

562
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,120
certain lights made certain color

563
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,639
spectrums they did not have any clue of

564
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,198
that [ __ ] yet they were still trying to

565
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:03,919
figure out

566
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:05,838
indoor cultivation from the beginning so

567
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:07,599
the pioneers is what we'll call them the

568
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,120
cannabis indoor pioneers

569
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,879
were getting whatever lights were

570
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,799
available they were getting whatever

571
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:14,240
dirt was available we didn't have a lot

572
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:15,758
of studying we didn't have a lot of

573
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,240
access if you lived in

574
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:20,159
rural arizona you were using probably

575
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,360
rural arizona dirt you didn't have

576
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:22,879
a growth store you may not have a

577
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,240
nursery and if you did like i said

578
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:25,120
before you didn't have an excuse to go

579
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,198
buy the [ __ ]

580
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,720
so you may have to drive an hour away

581
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:29,439
buy something that works you know

582
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,040
whatever

583
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,199
grandma betty's potting soil from

584
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:33,759
whatever local farm store that was near

585
00:16:33,198 --> 00:16:35,519
you and then

586
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,039
drive that back home an hour away so

587
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,959
that nobody knew what you bought

588
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:40,240
and then put your hopefully get some

589
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:41,599
seeds from somewhere that's

590
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,360
another thing where are we going to get

591
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,360
seeds from back in the day you either

592
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,278
had to know somebody that had some seeds

593
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,480
you had to buy some weed that had seeds

594
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:49,439
in it and grow those and hope for

595
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,278
success

596
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,720
or what a lot of people were doing is

597
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:54,320
our military members were

598
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,759
traveling overseas or a lot of

599
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,440
adventurous folks were traveling

600
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,399
overseas and they were acquiring seeds

601
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,240
from farms

602
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:02,320
where the cannabis was originated and

603
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,880
they were bringing those seeds back here

604
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,919
then they would get here with seeds who

605
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,120
knows where they came from well the

606
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:08,720
soldiers know where they came from but i

607
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:10,318
mean we had seeds coming from everywhere

608
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,838
we had seeds coming from thailand we had

609
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:13,519
seeds coming from afghanistan we had

610
00:17:11,838 --> 00:17:14,240
seeds coming from vietnam we had seeds

611
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:16,160
coming from

612
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,759
uh brazil we probably had seeds from

613
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,640
morocco there were seeds coming from

614
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:20,720
mexico

615
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,919
there were seeds coming from everywhere

616
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,279
all over the place

617
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,880
and we didn't know what we had we

618
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:25,678
probably had colombian gold seeds we

619
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,839
probably had

620
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:30,640
uh panama red seeds we probably had some

621
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:32,480
jamaican seeds probably some colombian

622
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,080
something of everything but who knows

623
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,880
what it was unless you knew which buds

624
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:36,399
it came from

625
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,840
you were just growing seeds at random

626
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,720
there was no you couldn't google it and

627
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:40,879
say i've got

628
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,558
arise seeds a rise is across a golden

629
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,760
goat and daybreaker it should take nine

630
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:45,519
weeks it should taste like

631
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:47,119
this we can [ __ ] look at ross to

632
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:48,400
jeff's podcast to know exactly how to

633
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:49,678
grow it they didn't have that [ __ ] they

634
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,200
were all experimenting

635
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,720
and flying by the seat of their pants

636
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,038
while they were getting stoned

637
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,079
so a lot of what we've got now a lot of

638
00:17:55,038 --> 00:17:58,480
the selections

639
00:17:56,079 --> 00:17:59,519
were done through the shittiest

640
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,558
equipment through

641
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:03,918
the shittiest sources like the where

642
00:18:02,558 --> 00:18:04,960
were where did the seeds come from what

643
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:06,320
equipment were they using

644
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,600
what kind of nutrients were they using

645
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:08,558
we didn't know much about nutrients i

646
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:10,079
mean there were a few

647
00:18:08,558 --> 00:18:11,599
guys i mean people were studying people

648
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:13,119
were advanced there were horticultural

649
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:14,319
specialists back then but nobody was

650
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:15,678
advanced as we are now

651
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:17,038
and you couldn't dial [ __ ] up you

652
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,480
couldn't just click on the internet you

653
00:18:17,038 --> 00:18:20,160
had to go to the library and read

654
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,599
books and people wouldn't go do that

655
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,200
back in the day especially potheads if

656
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:24,558
they caught a pothead at the library

657
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,440
reading a cultivation book they already

658
00:18:24,558 --> 00:18:26,558
know what you're doing

659
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,000
and you don't want to go there anyway

660
00:18:26,558 --> 00:18:28,798
you stink like weed you don't fit in it

661
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,119
felt weird

662
00:18:28,798 --> 00:18:33,119
so a lot of our selections came from our

663
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:35,839
forefathers they had to select [ __ ]

664
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:37,678
from random seeds from random lighting

665
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:38,959
with random nutrients with random grow

666
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,640
equipment they were probably grown with

667
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,079
rocks and five gallon buckets under a

668
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,120
street light in the basement just trying

669
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:44,319
to figure it all out

670
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:46,558
i don't know i really got my mind

671
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:47,439
thinking uh so now we're using all of

672
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:49,279
that stuff

673
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,960
as our breeding stock now all of the

674
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:53,119
[ __ ] that those guys selected

675
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,558
uh in the 60s and the 70s maybe even

676
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:55,599
before that because cannabis has been

677
00:18:54,558 --> 00:18:57,519
around for a while

678
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:58,959
i've heard stories of way back in the

679
00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:00,720
day jazz musicians

680
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,319
would come into town let's just say that

681
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,919
i know jazz musicians they play at the

682
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:05,279
club down the street after the show

683
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:06,720
they all come here we smoke a little bit

684
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:08,000
of weed we hang out they crash on my

685
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,038
couch they get up the next day

686
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,640
they go to the next state to play

687
00:19:09,038 --> 00:19:12,640
another gig while they're here we're

688
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,000
gonna smoke right that's just what we do

689
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,919
this was way back in the day before

690
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,759
everybody had herb they would leave me

691
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:19,520
some seeds they'd say hey jeff

692
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:21,200
these seeds came out of our herb i know

693
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:22,480
you like to smoke we like to smoke we're

694
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,080
gonna come on tour next year because

695
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,558
we're traveling musicians it's what we

696
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:26,720
do

697
00:19:24,558 --> 00:19:28,399
we want you to grow this grow these

698
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,839
seeds produce this herb

699
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,600
and then next year when we come back

700
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:33,119
you'll have more seeds and more herb for

701
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:34,480
us we can smoke with you you can

702
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:35,439
give us you could probably sell us some

703
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,480
herb if you grow it i don't know how

704
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,480
that worked i don't know the

705
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,919
arrangement but you give them herb you

706
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,798
give them seeds and then you end up with

707
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,080
herb and seeds

708
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:43,918
and then they travel around and they

709
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:45,359
take that herb to the next state maybe

710
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,120
i'm in pueblo colorado we'll say their

711
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:48,639
next gig is in [ __ ] santa fe

712
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:50,639
they drive down to santa fe they leave

713
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,480
some of my new seeds that i've made with

714
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,840
those people in santa fe and some weed

715
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,319
with them and they say grow this next

716
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:55,918
year

717
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:57,599
so everywhere they travel they dropped

718
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,880
off weed and seeds if they had it

719
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:00,959
and then every time they came back next

720
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,400
year weed and seeds and they expand

721
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,440
every year they got bigger they did more

722
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,960
gigs they didn't have to wait till

723
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,480
albuquerque to get to the next gig they

724
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,159
got to play in trinidad next year so

725
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,759
that was pueblo trinidad

726
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:11,600
albuquerque santa fe and they've got

727
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:13,119
weed growing everywhere that's just some

728
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:13,519
stories i've heard about how people used

729
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:15,038
to

730
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:17,759
start getting people growing weed and

731
00:20:15,038 --> 00:20:19,038
having a supplyable a reliable supply

732
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:20,798
of cannabis for when you're traveling

733
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:22,240
around old jazz musician story

734
00:20:20,798 --> 00:20:24,158
that was told to me by some old jazz

735
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,000
musician cats but

736
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:27,679
man think about those guys were the ones

737
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,679
selecting your cannabis

738
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,038
breeding strains they just dropped off

739
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:33,038
some seeds somebody grew it

740
00:20:31,038 --> 00:20:35,038
and then those guys had to select from

741
00:20:33,038 --> 00:20:36,319
that from that gene pool was what they

742
00:20:35,038 --> 00:20:38,798
got to work with

743
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:40,399
so we've got to either i'm not sure do

744
00:20:38,798 --> 00:20:42,240
we thank or do we blame

745
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,440
our forefathers for the selections which

746
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,038
we're working with now there were a lot

747
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,080
of guys like mel frank out there doing

748
00:20:45,038 --> 00:20:47,679
great selections

749
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:49,279
but also there were a lot of guys out

750
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:50,480
there in basements just doing random

751
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:52,798
selections

752
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,480
and then all of that became our future

753
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:56,400
gene pool what we've got now

754
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,759
so all of the stuff we're working with

755
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,320
now was based off of

756
00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:01,200
just really archaic equipment archaic

757
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:03,279
selections

758
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,640
i don't know really makes my brain think

759
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:06,240
would selections have been different

760
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,759
would we work be working with different

761
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,359
cannabis plants today would different

762
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:10,640
ship be popular would it have taken a

763
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:12,479
totally different route

764
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,240
i also think that they didn't have lab

765
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,319
testing nobody was looking for

766
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,480
other secondary cannabinoids everybody

767
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:20,480
was focused on high thc because

768
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,919
the only thing they had as a test was

769
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,519
them they could smoke it and go

770
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:25,120
i'm high as [ __ ] or they could smoke it

771
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:27,038
and go man i didn't get high

772
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:28,798
that was the lab test for them so we

773
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:30,158
tossed out everything that didn't get

774
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:31,679
you high as [ __ ] if it didn't have the

775
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:32,400
red eye head buzz to it that we were

776
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,640
looking for

777
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,919
it went away so basically i was just

778
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,440
daydreaming and wondering

779
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:39,038
how cannabis would be different if we'd

780
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,519
done different selections if we'd had

781
00:21:39,038 --> 00:21:41,759
different

782
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:42,720
equipment different technology uh

783
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:44,400
different seeds

784
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,839
uh just i don't know my brain went down

785
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,400
that path and i thought it was a fun

786
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:50,319
ramble to share with you guys but that

787
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,200
is my rant on led lighting big shout out

788
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:52,960
to my buddy keith

789
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,640
at black sail market for hooking me up

790
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,480
with two canon leds

791
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,400
i honestly was so impressed with the

792
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,038
first two but i ordered three more

793
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,720
already

794
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:02,400
uh they're here they'll be hung up very

795
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,798
soon they're going to go in

796
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,440
the mother room and the small veg space

797
00:22:04,798 --> 00:22:07,359
and then

798
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,360
once i see how this first room flowers

799
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:10,959
out if i'm as excited as i think i'm

800
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:13,599
going to be i will replace

801
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,240
all of the lights in my personal flower

802
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:16,000
space

803
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,359
with led lighting that's right i'll

804
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,919
switch my personal grow

805
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:21,519
from hps all to led lighting the

806
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:23,600
commercial grow will stay the same

807
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:25,359
trust me i'm not ready to make that leap

808
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:26,719
maybe when the technology evolves a

809
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:28,158
little a little better

810
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,159
and maybe but i'm a little more

811
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,960
impressed with it but not yet but so far

812
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:32,720
the homegrown

813
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,840
is going to make the switch all right

814
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,679

please don't stress on that but i do

840

appreciate all of the people who have

841
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,558
stepped up during this weirdness

842
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:25,600
thank you and big thanks to our friend

843
00:23:22,558 --> 00:23:28,000
smoke what for the new patreon support

844
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:29,279
his message goes on to say i'm starting

845
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,038
to experiment with creating some

846
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:33,119
personal seats but i battle temps with

847
00:23:31,038 --> 00:23:35,038
my leds in small spaces and i have

848
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:37,279
trouble running over 400 watts and

849
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:38,558
summer is right around the corner yes it

850
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:39,759
is my friend you better figure out how

851
00:23:38,558 --> 00:23:41,599
to cool that off

852
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:43,278
it says i don't have any questions but

853
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:45,119
the project i am starting is going to be

854
00:23:43,278 --> 00:23:46,880
a fun one and i cannot wait to update

855
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:48,319
you in a year or so

856
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,080
bro i look forward to the updates i

857
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:52,480
cannot wait to see what you do

858
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:54,158
it says since i might have to wait until

859
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,919
winter to produce any seeds

860
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:57,520
it could be an uphill battle reaching

861
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,799
some of my goals until we find some

862
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:01,119
legalization here

863
00:23:58,798 --> 00:24:02,879
and i can stretch out a bit bro don't

864
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:04,000
get yourself in trouble and my advice is

865
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,679
if it's going to be an uphill

866
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,278
battle wait until the winter because you

867
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:09,840
don't want to make struggle

868
00:24:07,278 --> 00:24:10,960
seeds now there is another paragraph

869
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:12,720
here and it says

870
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,640
one thing i thought might be a good idea

871
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,720
is to collect genetics for when my state

872
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,640
opens up to the legal markets

873
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,319
what would you suggest for strains that

874
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,400
are either overlooked in the legal

875
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:25,119
community or ones that possibly never

876
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,880
made it into the legal cannabis markets

877
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:28,479
i have the most i have most of the

878
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,440
popular ones in your collection but i

879
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,360
don't know much about

880
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,278
other strains out there despite there

881
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:34,719
being epic strains everywhere

882
00:24:33,278 --> 00:24:36,400
i'm thinking of something that i can

883
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,079
bring to the groves that lack the

884
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,759
product the product to fill them when

885
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:42,639
legalization passes

886
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:45,119
i says anyways until next time stay irie

887
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,480
hug your mom and take a fat dab for me

888
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:48,399
emphasis on the dabs because

889
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:51,200
concentrates are too illegal here

890
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,919
and i don't want to risk the 10 to 20

891
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,319
year

892
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:55,038
lodging they offer for having them holy

893
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:57,599
[ __ ]

894
00:24:55,038 --> 00:24:58,640
that puts life into perspective dude

895
00:24:57,599 --> 00:25:00,480
this person said

896
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,919
10 to 20 years for possession of

897
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:05,278
concentrates where they are

898
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:06,960
and i have got 4 8 12 and there is at

899
00:25:05,278 --> 00:25:08,319
least 20 grams of concentrate sitting

900
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,400
here on the table

901
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:12,000
bro that puts [ __ ] into perspective i am

902
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,278
blessed i'm thankful to be here to be

903
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,200
able to take these dabs

904
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:16,400
i will for sure take a fat dab for you

905
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,240
my friend smoke what

906
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,320
now let's focus focus on the question

907
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,319
here uh smoke what asked

908
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:23,839
uh they want to start saving genetics

909
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:25,918
they want to have genetics ready

910
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:27,839
for when legalization happens in their

911
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:29,440
area they want to be able to put quality

912
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:30,399
genetics into a dispensary

913
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,919
and they want to know what i would

914
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,798
suggest for strains that are either

915
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:35,440
overlooked

916
00:25:32,798 --> 00:25:36,158
or possibly never made it into legal

917
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:40,000
cannabis

918
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:41,520
markets that's a really good question um

919
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,599
strains that never made it that are

920
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:45,839
often overlooked are kind of some of the

921
00:25:43,599 --> 00:25:46,639
older strains that people ask for you're

922
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:48,240
going to get

923
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,000
if you open a dispensary and you start

924
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,400
getting traffic you're going to get

925
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,640
an older demographic that will ask for

926
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:58,000
uh stuff like acapulco gold

927
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:59,520
and uh colombian gold and the panama red

928
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,759
and stuff like that they're gonna want

929
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:03,918
that stuff the older uh like the veteran

930
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:05,679
age guys are gonna want that [ __ ]

931
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:06,960
then there's gonna be another crowd that

932
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:09,440
comes in and they're gonna want

933
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,000
durbin poison and white widow and train

934
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,558
wreck

935
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,679
that is a generational thing then after

936
00:26:12,558 --> 00:26:15,278
that you're going to get people that

937
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:17,840
come in and want sour diesel

938
00:26:15,278 --> 00:26:19,599
and chem dog and og kush that's another

939
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:21,119
generational thing then right after that

940
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:23,759
you're going to get people that want

941
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:25,678
all of the wedding cake and cake balm

942
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:27,679
and [ __ ] girl scout cookies and all

943
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:29,519
the girl scout cookies out crosses that

944
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:31,759
shit's gonna happen also

945
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:33,679
it is really hard to fill all of the

946
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:36,960
needs for a dispensary

947
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:38,720
for the shelves um you kind of asked

948
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,480
me to mention things that were

949
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,839
overlooked or things that have been

950
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,759
forgotten about

951
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:45,678
like i said before the panama's the

952
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:47,359
acapulcos the colombians those things

953
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:48,960
missed the dispensary they never made it

954
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:50,000
into the dispensary but there's probably

955
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,798
a reason

956
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,519
um in a commercial environment you've

957
00:26:52,798 --> 00:26:55,278
got to meet

958
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:57,440
goals you've got to reach production

959
00:26:55,278 --> 00:26:59,440
goals and that has to be a schedule

960
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,960
if the plants take 11 or 12 weeks to

961
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,880
flower they're probably not going to

962
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,159
make it in a commercial grow i need 9

963
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,080
weekers

964
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:07,278
if it takes 8 to ten weeks i'm going to

965
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:09,439
run it nine weeks

966
00:27:07,278 --> 00:27:11,519
to fit into my schedules and that plant

967
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,360
if it wants to go nine if it survives

968
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:15,278
if it makes everybody happy that

969
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:17,599
qualifies for the commercial grow

970
00:27:15,278 --> 00:27:18,960
it's got to put out weight it's got to

971
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:20,639
hit harvest goals

972
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,079
most of my plants hit certain weights if

973
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,600
they don't hit enough weight i'm not

974
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:24,798
going to reach goals i'm not going to

975
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:26,398
get bonuses we're not going to have

976
00:27:24,798 --> 00:27:27,200
enough medicine for the shelves nobody

977
00:27:26,398 --> 00:27:29,199
will be happy

978
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,120
i cannot keep that plant in the facility

979
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,120
it's got to go so it's got to reach

980
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:34,639
the weight goals that has also got to

981
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:36,239
reach potency goals

982
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,759
if it puts out a whole bunch of weed in

983
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,720
nine weeks but when people smoke it

984
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:40,720
nobody gets high

985
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,480
that plant's got to go so it's got a

986
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,000
flower on time it's got to put out

987
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,919
weight it's got to be potent

988
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,599
it's also got to sell when i put it on

989
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:50,559
the shelf does it go anywhere

990
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:51,519
there are probably 70 strains in a lot

991
00:27:50,558 --> 00:27:52,960
of my commercial

992
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:55,278
production facilities we have somewhere

993
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:58,000
between 50 and 70 mother plants

994
00:27:55,278 --> 00:27:59,839
per commercial cultivation facility

995
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,398
there's a reason for each and every one

996
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:02,319
of them

997
00:28:00,398 --> 00:28:04,079
if one of them slows down or doesn't

998
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:05,038
have momentum on the shelf if it sits

999
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:06,720
there for long enough

1000
00:28:05,038 --> 00:28:08,240
toward the time i grow the next batch if

1001
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,919
they've still got some of that i don't

1002
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,599
grow it anymore that plant gets cold we

1003
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:13,520
remove that from the system

1004
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:15,038
bye bye it doesn't work for a commercial

1005
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:16,879
cultivation facility

1006
00:28:15,038 --> 00:28:18,240
so there are a lot of things to think

1007
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,240
about when you're trying to

1008
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,919
select genetics for a commercial

1009
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,240
cultivation facility

1010
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:26,399
um everybody every dispensary should

1011
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,640
have something fruity

1012
00:28:26,398 --> 00:28:30,079
whether it's like a i'm saying fruity

1013
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,919
you want fruity flavors if it's blue

1014
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:32,639
dream or golden goat that qualifies as

1015
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:34,799
fruity

1016
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,320
everybody needs a berry flavor if it's

1017
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:37,839
blueberry if it's cherry

1018
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:39,439
you need some kind of berries in there a

1019
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:40,319
berry mix you need fruit you need

1020
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,159
berries

1021
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:43,839
uh you need floral i think every

1022
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:45,840
dispensary needs something floral it's

1023
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:47,678
gotta smell like sweet flowers girls

1024
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:48,720
love that floral smell and [ __ ] some

1025
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:51,120
guys love it too

1026
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,839
so you need fruit berries and floral

1027
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:53,439
that could be

1028
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:55,038
one strain that covers all of those and

1029
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,798
hopefully they don't catch on but if

1030
00:28:55,038 --> 00:28:58,879
you've got three strains to cover fruit

1031
00:28:56,798 --> 00:29:00,879
berries and floral you're in business

1032
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,159
also every dispensary needs something

1033
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:06,240
that smells gassy

1034
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:07,039
and or fuelly sour diesel uh chem di95

1035
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,919
something in that

1036
00:29:07,038 --> 00:29:11,839
fuely funky gassy kind of range we also

1037
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:13,278
need some earthy smelling [ __ ] something

1038
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:15,599
like og kush

1039
00:29:13,278 --> 00:29:17,519

berries floral gas and earth is

1044
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:27,840
something that i think all dispensaries

1045
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,759
require required to have on their shelf

1046

that is your basic shopping area right

1047
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:32,480
there

1048
00:29:30,558 --> 00:29:33,599
uh then after that people are going to

1049
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,919
ask for your highest

1050
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:37,278
lab tests it's all about the lab test so

blend perfectly well together it's not

1183
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:28,720
the best marketing strategy that may

1184
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,919
sound crazy because they've both got

1185
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,798
money in their pockets they're all

1186
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:32,559
buying herb

1187
00:33:30,798 --> 00:33:34,558
but you've got to set the environment

1188
00:33:32,558 --> 00:33:36,879
that you expect for your dispensary

1189
00:33:34,558 --> 00:33:38,960
it you'll see what i mean it's a niche

1190
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,440
thing if you've got the acapulco gold

1191
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,200
and

1192
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,798
the [ __ ] cake bomb you'll get a good

1193
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,919
crowd it's hard to keep it balanced out

1194
00:33:42,798 --> 00:33:45,359
of what stays on the shelf

1195
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:46,799
you've only got so much shelf space

1196
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:48,158
you've only got so many plants there's a

1197
00:33:46,798 --> 00:33:49,679
lot of thinking to do

1198
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:51,200
so which kind of crowd do you want to

1199
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:52,159
bring what kind of atmosphere do you

1200
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,360
want to invent

1201
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:55,760
what type of products do you want to

1202
00:33:53,359 --> 00:33:57,439

produce it's got to hit numbers it's got

1264
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,359
to be

1265
00:35:33,838 --> 00:35:36,960
not a pain in the ass to trim if it

1266
00:35:35,358 --> 00:35:37,598
slows down the trim crew too much get

1267
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,920
rid of it

1268
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:41,519
if it messes up any of your flow it

1269
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:43,200
needs to go if it works well for

1270
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:44,000
everything from the beginning to the end

1271
00:35:43,199 --> 00:35:45,679
if it goes from the

1272
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,760
seed to the cash register without

1273
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:49,039
problems put that [ __ ] on the shelf put

1274
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,800
that [ __ ] in the grow

1275
00:35:49,039 --> 00:35:52,559
but it also has to make all of the

1276
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,880
consumers happy so

1277
00:35:52,559 --> 00:35:56,559
you have to kind of decide what ends up

1278
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:58,160
happening as people set up dispensaries

1279
00:35:56,559 --> 00:35:59,519
kind of based on like my breeding is

1280
00:35:58,159 --> 00:36:00,960
based on what i enjoy

1281
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:02,719
my dispensary would be filled with

1282
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:04,240
strains that i enjoy i would attract a

1283
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:06,159
crowd similar to myself

1284
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:08,000
that smokes and enjoys things that i

1285
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:10,639
enjoy the demographic would end up being

1286
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,079
probably 25 to 45 year old dudes that

1287
00:36:10,639 --> 00:36:13,199
listen to reggae and have dreadlocks

1288
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:15,200
that would be a big part of my

1289
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:16,078
demographic at my dispensary but that

1290
00:36:15,199 --> 00:36:17,358
that would be cool with me because

1291
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:18,640
that's who i hang out with i want

1292
00:36:17,358 --> 00:36:19,440
everybody to come and shop but i mean

1293
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:21,598
the main core

1294
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,960
would just be 25 to 40 year old dudes

1295
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:24,640
with dreadlocks listening to reggae

1296
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:26,639
music on their way to band practice

1297
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:27,920
probably who would stop by all right um

1298
00:36:26,639 --> 00:36:29,598
so it's all up to you what you want to

1299
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,639
put in the dispensary it's got to work

1301
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:33,039

1302
