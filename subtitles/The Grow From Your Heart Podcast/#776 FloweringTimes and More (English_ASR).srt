of support let's send a big shout out to

48
00:01:49,978 --> 00:01:54,239
everybody in Colorado who voted to

49
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:56,399
support the legalization of medical

50
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:58,140
mushrooms that's right here in the state

51
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,560
of Colorado we recently had an election

52
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:03,719
and we did pass the legalization of

53
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,180
medical mushrooms in my opinion that is

54
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:07,739
a huge step forward I believe that if a

55
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,840
medicine works for you you should be

56
00:02:07,739 --> 00:02:11,280
able to take it I was a big proponent

57
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,439
obviously a big supporter of medical

58
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,598
cannabis and I am also a big supporter

59
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:17,039
of the medical mushroom movement I

60
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:18,959
believe like I said if something helps

61
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:20,280
you improve the quality of your life if

62
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,439
your mental state is improved if you're

63
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,598
physical state is improved we should be

64
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:26,159
able to consume what we like even if it

65
00:02:24,598 --> 00:02:28,199
doesn't improve our state we should be

66
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:29,878
able to do what we like to do with and

67
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:31,560
to our bodies that's the freedom that I

68
00:02:29,878 --> 00:02:34,318
feel we should be given so I do support

69
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,000
this legalization of medical mushrooms

70
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:38,219
big up to the entire state of Colorado

71
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,080
uh thank you to everybody who voted for

72
00:02:38,219 --> 00:02:41,759
that I definitely voted for that no

73
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,620
several people who were on team

74
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:46,500
mushrooms so big up proud of you

75
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:49,200
Colorado you guys this can be taken as a

76
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:51,120
very serious change in time this is how

77
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:53,339
the medical marijuana movement started

78
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,500
this is how dispensaries popped up this

79
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,300
is how we started the Cannabis movement

80
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:59,580
in Colorado it started with the medical

81
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:01,680
cannabis we had a couple of dispensaries

82
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:03,480
then we had a lot of dispensaries than

83
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,040
they were everywhere that led to people

84
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:06,659
that didn't have medical marijuana

85
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:08,459
seeing dispensaries and saying why can't

86
00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:10,799
I shop there then we passed recreational

87
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:12,900
Cannabis now we've got legal adult use

88
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,760
cannabis where everybody 21 and over can

89
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,500
walk into a dispensary if they've got

90
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:18,959
the proper ID they can buy illegal

91
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:21,180
cannabis this is the same thing that is

92
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,800
happening with medical mushroom pretty

93
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:24,840
soon if we shape the laws correctly

94
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,140
there will be stores where you can go

95
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:29,939
and you can buy your legal medical

96
00:03:27,139 --> 00:03:32,339
mushrooms if you have been growing

97
00:03:29,939 --> 00:03:34,199
cultivating uh spreading mushroom magic

98
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:36,479
since before legalization this could be

99
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:38,579
the time for you to take control of a

100
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:41,340
brand new business opportunity you could

101
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:43,019
possibly open a mushroom dispensary this

102
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:45,000
is how the medical marijuana movement

103
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:47,640
happened this will be no different with

104
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,199
medical mushrooms in my opinion A lot of

105
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:50,639
people look up to those few people who

106
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:52,619
started the medical cannabis movement

107
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:54,719
here who are well known for growing

108
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:56,459
making concentrates just being involved

109
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:58,439
in the movement you look at those people

110
00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:00,000
like Pioneers you can be that in the

111
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:02,519
mushroom movement if you take the

112
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,318
initiative to do that now so if you are

113
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:05,819
a business-minded person if you are a

114
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:08,098
mushroom cultivator if you've been a

115
00:04:05,818 --> 00:04:10,199
mushroom mushroom magician if you've

116
00:04:08,098 --> 00:04:11,938
been a mushroom Shaman for several years

117
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:13,738
there are a few of my friends that your

118
00:04:11,938 --> 00:04:16,079
faces are popping into my mind right now

119
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:17,639
you know who I'm talking to bro you're

120
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,560
here in Colorado you're already

121
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:21,478
cultivating mushrooms you know how to do

122
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,699
it let's get you a building let's set

123
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:25,740
you up a fully legal mushroom dispensary

124
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:27,720
now is the time you guys let's figure

125
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:29,759
out how legal that is how you can do it

126
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:31,919
get ahead of the game and let's get that

127
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,620
going because if you don't get it going

128
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:36,839
eventually some Corporation or some big

129
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:38,819
time company will come in and they will

130
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:40,679
take over your spot you've got passion

131
00:04:38,819 --> 00:04:42,360
you've got commitment you've got the

132
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,040
magic you don't want some company coming

133
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,840
in that doesn't have that they've got

134
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,280
money and they've got the ability to buy

135
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:49,319
a building and produce mushrooms and

136
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:51,119
sell them I'd prefer somebody with some

137
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:53,279
experience and some passion in it just

138
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,780
like we preferred in cannabis all right

139
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:56,459
so now is the opportunity you guys that

140
00:04:54,779 --> 00:04:58,439
was the bottom line there big up to

141
00:04:56,459 --> 00:05:00,899
Colorado for uh passing the medical

142
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:03,000
mushroom initiative there and also you

143
00:05:00,899 --> 00:05:05,279
guys if this is your uh your spot in the

144
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,019
world this may be your time to shine

145
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:09,059
let's get that medical mushroom

146
00:05:07,019 --> 00:05:11,819
Dispensary going and hey once you get it

147
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:14,160
going uh reach out I would love to trade

148
00:05:11,819 --> 00:05:17,099
some advertising for some store credit

149
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,080
if you know what I'm saying all right

150
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:20,400
big up to the mushroom gang big up to

151
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:22,199
everybody who voted I know I try not to

152
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:23,339
get too political on this show Mike's

153
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:25,319
not here today we don't need to talk

154
00:05:23,339 --> 00:05:27,599
about politics but big up to everybody

155
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:30,779
who voted we are obviously making change

156
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,759
because we did legalize mushrooms that's

157
00:05:30,779 --> 00:05:34,079
pretty amazing to me all right let's

158
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:36,419
move forward I do have something else I

159
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:38,399
want to talk about there is one person

160
00:05:36,418 --> 00:05:41,038
uh who watches and listens to this

161
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:43,918
podcast who sends me plenty of emails

162
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:45,959
and they question every single thing

163
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:47,819
that I say they doubt all of my

164
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:50,459
techniques they doubt all of my methods

165
00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:52,199
but then they grow using a lot of my

166
00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:54,538
techniques and methods but every podcast

167
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:55,919
I put out I get feedback about how one

168
00:05:54,538 --> 00:05:57,379
thing I said could have been wrong how

169
00:05:55,918 --> 00:06:00,240
it would have been better if I did this

170
00:05:57,379 --> 00:06:03,478
I want to say that is good you guys

171
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:05,220
question everything I am not the only uh

172
00:06:03,478 --> 00:06:06,779
cannabis grower on the planet I'm not

173
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:08,880
the only breeder on the planet I'm not

174
00:06:06,779 --> 00:06:10,918
the only podcaster on the planet I'm not

175
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:12,959
the only one with ideas and standard

176
00:06:10,918 --> 00:06:16,019
operating procedures of how this plant

177
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:17,519
could and can be grown I don't know your

178
00:06:16,019 --> 00:06:18,899
room I don't know your environment I

179
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:20,939
don't know your needs maybe I'm

180
00:06:18,899 --> 00:06:22,318
completely wrong with what you you need

181
00:06:20,939 --> 00:06:24,899
from a cannabis plant or your

182
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,879
cultivation when I say something I'm

183
00:06:24,899 --> 00:06:28,318
speaking what works for me and what has

184
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:31,139
been proven to work in a commercial

185
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:33,900
environment and several other uh private

186
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:36,120
and personal cultivation areas it might

187
00:06:33,899 --> 00:06:38,579
not work for you so take everything I

188
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:40,019
say as suggestion do your own research

189
00:06:38,579 --> 00:06:41,399
and if you question things that I say

190
00:06:40,019 --> 00:06:43,079
that is good you should question

191
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:45,120
everything you should never trust

192
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:47,639
anybody you should always double check

193
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,379
me reference me cross-check me make sure

194
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:51,780
that what I'm saying applies to the

195
00:06:49,379 --> 00:06:52,680
project you were working on I enjoy that

196
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:54,359
there's somebody out there who's

197
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:56,459
questioning everything that I say it

198
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,620
keeps me on my toes and it reminds me

199
00:06:56,459 --> 00:07:00,599
that the things I'm teaching maybe I say

200
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:01,860
do this to your plan on one episode then

201
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,900
I'll read a totally different message

202
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:06,120
and I'll say do not do this to your

203
00:07:03,899 --> 00:07:07,799
plant and it'll just be situational but

204
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,720
maybe in a different situation it would

205
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,060
be totally different advice so take

206
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:14,400
everything I say situationally and take

207
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:16,199
it all as a suggestion and remember I am

208
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:18,418
not The Wizard of Oz I'm not the grow

209
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:19,800
Guru I've got a lot of experience in

210
00:07:18,418 --> 00:07:21,598
different types of environments I've

211
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:23,220
grown and in homes I've grown in

212
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:25,620
warehouses I've grown in garages I've

213
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:27,000
grown in Shacks I've grown in any type

214
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:28,800
of environment you can imagine a

215
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,259
beautiful Warehouse a filthy Warehouse

216
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,180
I've done grows indoors and Outdoors in

217
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:34,740
greenhouses so that makes me think that

218
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:36,780
I know how to do a lot of things but I

219
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:39,060
may not know how to do exactly what you

220
00:07:36,779 --> 00:07:40,859
need done so get some ideas do some

221
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:42,839
research and definitely cross-reference

222
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:44,220
and double check because I'm not the

223
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:46,258
only one out here teaching there are

224
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:48,060
other ideas and ways to do it the way

225
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:49,319
that I do it is the way that I do it the

226
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:51,418
way you do it may be totally different

227
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:52,800
and guess what it's not wrong the way

228
00:07:51,418 --> 00:07:55,079
another guy does it could be totally

229
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,360
different guess what still not wrong as

230
00:07:55,079 --> 00:08:00,300
long as we are all having a safe

231
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,860
effective satisfying Harvest nobody's

232
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:03,598
doing it wrong when you do it wrong is

233
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:05,939
when you are contaminating product

234
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:07,978
poisoning patients or killing plants

235
00:08:05,939 --> 00:08:09,300
that's when you're doing it wrong so if

236
00:08:07,978 --> 00:08:12,180
you're questioning what I'm teaching you

237
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:13,860
that is good question everything don't

238
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:15,660
believe anything anybody says like I

239
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:17,400
said double check me cross check me

240
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:19,680
check some references listen to other

241
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:21,839
podcasts read some other books honestly

242
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,699
before you even listen to my podcast I

243
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:26,098
would highly recommend that you read a

244
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:27,900
few basic grow Books A lot of people

245
00:08:26,098 --> 00:08:30,719
send me questions I see crazy questions

246
00:08:27,899 --> 00:08:32,158
on social media and I honestly think

247
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,778
that many of those questions could have

248
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:35,399
been answered if somebody just bought a

249
00:08:33,778 --> 00:08:37,979
basic grow book from your favorite grow

250
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:40,679
author it could be Ed Rosenthal Jorge

251
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:41,820
Cervantes Greg green Mel Frank there are

252
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:44,098
a bunch of people out there that write

253
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:46,920
great cannabis books uh read one of them

254
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:48,360

255
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:50,819
teaches you the basics so that you

256
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:53,278
understand the basics learn the basics

257
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:55,620
then listen to these podcasts then read

258
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:57,240
more books Listen to More podcast expand

259
00:08:55,620 --> 00:09:00,120
your knowledge double check everything

260
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,860
cross-reference it but I am not offended

261
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,899
that you question everything that I say

262
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:05,339
that you doubt some of my advice that is

263
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:07,440
a great thing challenge me challenge

264
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:10,500
yourself uh the number one thing that

265
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,720
people challenge me on is the 18 6 uh

266
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:14,220
increasing uh Bud density and speeding

267
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,019
up flowering time at the end of flower

268
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,820
uh let me talk about that really quickly

269
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:20,220
I believe that at the end of flower for

270
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:22,980
the past for the last 10 to 14 days of

271
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:25,320
flower I turned my lights back to 18 on

272
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:26,940
and six hours off because I believe it

273
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,980
makes my plants finish a little more

274
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:30,660
quickly and they get a little more dense

275
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:32,159
I just feel like they're they get

276
00:09:30,659 --> 00:09:33,659
chunkier and fatter and there's more

277
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:35,579
weight and more density so that's

278
00:09:33,659 --> 00:09:37,860
something that I do a lot of people

279
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:39,240
think that that is completely crazy you

280
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:41,278
know who really doesn't think it's crazy

281
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:43,500
the people who have tried it they all

282
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:45,299
report back with great results the only

283
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,220
people who have negative feedback and

284
00:09:45,299 --> 00:09:49,919
negative ideas are the people who have

285
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:51,420
not tried that so question me doubt me

286
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:52,979
but then go try the [ __ ] that I

287
00:09:51,419 --> 00:09:55,019
recommend and see if it works for you

288
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:56,639
don't be afraid to experiment you may

289
00:09:55,019 --> 00:09:58,379
kill a couple of plants you may also

290
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:00,419
realize that you just learned a super

291
00:09:58,379 --> 00:10:02,220
amazing technique that will improve your

292
00:10:00,419 --> 00:10:04,199
grow and increase the amount of harvest

293
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:06,000
you're going to get this time and every

294
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:08,459
Harvest from here on out

295
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,679
but please do question me I am not some

296
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:13,199
grow Guru I've got a lot of experience

297
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:15,059
and I've got insomnia I don't sleep very

298
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,220
well and instead of just playing video

299
00:10:15,059 --> 00:10:19,319
games or doing something weird I read

300
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:20,879
the internet I read books I scroll

301
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,740
around and figure out how to grow weed

302
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:24,240
better that's how I got really good at

303
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:26,820
producing cannabis is I just have

304
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,500
insomnia instead of wasting that time I

305
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:30,899
do a lot of reading and then after I

306
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:33,600
read I apply what I read you can read a

307
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:35,519
lot of books you could read how to do a

308
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,200
lot of things but until you put your

309
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,419
hands in the dirt get some scissors in

310
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,220
your hand pull on some leaves smell

311
00:10:39,419 --> 00:10:42,719
those plants you're not going to get the

312
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:44,820
experience from the book you got to get

313
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,160
in there but read those books then get

314
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:49,019
in there and grow that weed that's why

315
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:50,399
I'm uh that's why I know a lot of stuff

316
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:52,078
because I've read the books and then I

317
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,240
just went and did it I got lucky enough

318
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:56,879
to build my own personal grow way early

319
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,560
on in the legalization movement uh

320
00:10:56,879 --> 00:11:01,139
possibly before that but we won't talk

321
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:02,639
too much about that and then I got lucky

322
00:11:01,139 --> 00:11:04,379
enough to be involved in several

323
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:05,939
commercial facilities and I learned a

324
00:11:04,379 --> 00:11:07,439
lot in every one of those facilities

325
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:09,480
he's also I'm friends with a lot of

326
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,000
great Growers and breeders so that helps

327
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:14,759
out that gives me a lot of input I'm

328
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,860
passionately curious I love learning if

329
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:18,899
I care about a subject I will absorb all

330
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:20,519
of the info that I can as quickly as

331
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:22,078
possible and that's what I've done with

332
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:24,778
cannabis and I kind of feel like it's my

333
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:26,879
job to feed that information to you guys

334
00:11:24,778 --> 00:11:28,559
in an understandable way I take in a lot

335
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:30,120
of things and then I try to filter it

336
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:32,219
and put it back out there in a way that

337
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,600
all of you listening learn in a

338
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:35,759
different way and I try to teach each

339
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,920
and every one of you in a way that you

340
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:39,179
can be entertained and learn the thing

341
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:41,399
I'm trying to teach without getting

342
00:11:39,179 --> 00:11:42,838
bored because I did not like listening

343
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:44,458
in school you could tell by my Rambles

344
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:46,860
here I've got add and I don't like to

345
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:48,778
stay on one subject for very long unless

346
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:51,480
I'm super interested obviously cannabis

347
00:11:48,778 --> 00:11:53,039
keeps me interested anyway

348
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,480
um just because I teach one way doesn't

349
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:57,299
mean that's the only way to do things

350
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,459
double check me cross-reference me and

351
00:11:57,299 --> 00:12:01,078
um be flexible you guys and like I said

352
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:02,939
a minute ago there's no wrong way to do

353
00:12:01,078 --> 00:12:04,199
it the only wrong way to do it is it

354
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:05,880
like I said if you're poisoning somebody

355
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,440
if you burn down the grow if you kill

356
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:09,480
filled out if you kill all the plants

357
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,980
[ __ ] like that is when you fail you know

358
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,240
when you do that if you're happy with

359
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:14,459
your Harvest you can do everything

360
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,620
completely differently than me I grow in

361
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:18,239
soilless mix and cocoa you may do it in

362
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:20,220
Hydro we're already going way different

363
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,620
we're both going to have successful

364
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:24,600
outcomes we're both on the same team and

365
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:26,339
that is what counts all right I rambled

366
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,680
for way too long on that let's move

367
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:30,240
forward into the next topic here I

368
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:32,578
recently popped into a chat room and

369
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:35,820
they were having a heated debate the

370
00:12:32,578 --> 00:12:39,000
topic of that debate was when is day one

371
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:40,140
of flower we like to keep track of how

372
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,179
long our plants have been in the

373
00:12:40,139 --> 00:12:44,220
flowering phase it's good to have a mark

374
00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:45,838
of wind day one is that way you know how

375
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:48,060
long you've been going how long to

376
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:51,899
anticipate before Harvest so a lot of

377
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:55,078
people are arguing when is day one day

378
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:59,879
one is the day that you turn your timer

379
00:12:55,078 --> 00:13:02,578
from 18 6 or 24 or whatever it's on 2 12

380
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:05,278
12. day one is the day you change that

381
00:13:02,578 --> 00:13:09,120
timer to a shorter day that first short

382
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:10,860
day is day one that is day one I

383
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,179
wouldn't wait until you see pistols I

384
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:14,879
wouldn't wait until something else

385
00:13:12,179 --> 00:13:16,859
happens why make it an algebra problem

386
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:19,860
we've already got the answer it was

387
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:23,159
today I changed the light from 1806 to

388
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:24,899
1212 on Thursday November 10th that is

389
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:26,819
day one we're gonna write that down that

390
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:29,399
will forever be day one that can't

391
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:32,639
change that won't be adjusted that is

392
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:34,500
the solid day one the Breeders right on

393
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,659
the seed pack how long we think those

394
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:38,159
seeds should probably take and I am

395
00:13:36,659 --> 00:13:40,500
putting those numbers on the pack I'm

396
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:42,838
making the seeds I'm the one making the

397
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:44,220
packages I'm making the labels I know

398
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:47,279
that those seeds are going to take

399
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:48,959
approximately 70 days from the day that

400
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:51,059
you change the light cycle I didn't

401
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:52,859
change the light cycle wait to see

402
00:13:51,059 --> 00:13:54,899
something happen then start counting

403
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:56,759
that is that's silly that is what I'm

404
00:13:54,899 --> 00:13:59,278
calling that an algebra problem it's not

405
00:13:56,759 --> 00:14:01,139
flower time plus two minus two weeks

406
00:13:59,278 --> 00:14:03,659
minus five days plus the amount of light

407
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:05,519
hours no it's from [ __ ] like I said

408
00:14:03,659 --> 00:14:08,039
November 10th is day one because that's

409
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:10,560
when we we change the timer that is the

410
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:12,659
day on my seed packages you will see

411
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:15,359
stuff like nine to ten weeks flowering

412
00:14:12,659 --> 00:14:16,799
time 10 to 12 weeks flowering time I put

413
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,480
that stuff on there because I have

414
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:20,519
determined that that is how long those

415
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,740
seeds take in the average grow

416
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:24,480
environment I have grown those seeds

417
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:26,278
myself I've grown them plenty of times

418
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,440
to see how long they take in my grow

419
00:14:26,278 --> 00:14:30,240
space then I sent those seeds out to

420
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:32,399
friends to testers and they grow them

421
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,620
they send me test results they send me

422
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,778
test reports they tell me how long it

423
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:38,519
took those plants to flower I compile

424
00:14:36,778 --> 00:14:40,679
all of that data and I do an average

425
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:43,078
basically most of the time it's about 70

426
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:44,759
days for the stuff that I breed I see

427
00:14:43,078 --> 00:14:46,679
some stuff come a little bit early I see

428
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:48,778
some stuff a little bit longer but I do

429
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:51,059
include that on the package if I say

430
00:14:48,778 --> 00:14:53,039
these plants finish in nine to ten weeks

431
00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:55,799
that means out of the hundred tester

432
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:57,899
packs I sent probably 70 to 80 percent

433
00:14:55,799 --> 00:15:00,179
of them finished in the time frame I

434
00:14:57,899 --> 00:15:02,519
printed on that package there will be

435
00:15:00,179 --> 00:15:05,039
outliers there will always be outliers

436
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:07,259
those outliers May finish earlier than

437
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:09,240
the time I recommend those outliers also

438
00:15:07,259 --> 00:15:11,278
could take longer than the time I

439
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:13,500
recommended on the package but that

440
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:15,659
number I put on the package is ideally

441
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:17,458
the amount of time it should take for

442
00:15:15,659 --> 00:15:19,980
those plants to finish in most

443
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:21,359
conditions you may have extreme heat you

444
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:23,759
may have extreme cold you may have

445
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:26,278
extreme dry or humid you may over or

446
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:27,659
under water you may over or under feed I

447
00:15:26,278 --> 00:15:30,179
don't know what could go on in your room

448
00:15:27,659 --> 00:15:33,179
but in most cases the time I put on the

449
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:35,039
back of that package is fairly accurate

450
00:15:33,179 --> 00:15:36,899
so when I say those seeds are going to

451
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:39,059
take approximately nine to ten weeks

452
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:41,278
that means that when I grew them most of

453
00:15:39,059 --> 00:15:43,319
my phenotypes took nine to ten weeks

454
00:15:41,278 --> 00:15:45,120
when my testers grew them most of them

455
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:47,220
took nine to ten weeks I get a lot of

456
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,899
pictures I get a lot of reports and I

457
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:50,399
just compile that data together and I

458
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:52,379
really pay attention to what people tell

459
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:54,539
me and then I make all the descriptions

460
00:15:52,379 --> 00:15:56,578
and reports based on what I saw and

461
00:15:54,539 --> 00:15:59,099
based on what all of the test Rovers saw

462
00:15:56,578 --> 00:16:01,679
and then I try to compile and convey

463
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:04,019
that information to you in a useful way

464
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:06,059
I try to put that data on the package I

465
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:08,100
try to make sure it's on the website I

466
00:16:06,059 --> 00:16:10,198
really do try my best to get all of that

467
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:12,420
accurate data to you because I know how

468
00:16:10,198 --> 00:16:14,458
critical and crucial that is in Agro it

469
00:16:12,419 --> 00:16:17,099
does really help to have a good idea of

470
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:19,319
how long it is going to take for these

471
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:21,959
seeds or plants to finish in your grow

472
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:24,000
now let me add on to this I keep saying

473
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:25,979
the plants may take nine to ten weeks or

474
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,078
eight to nine weeks to finish let's talk

475
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:30,720
about something very important here when

476
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:33,120
I'm saying nine weeks I mean they will

477
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,920
take nine full weeks to finish not let

478
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,259
eight weeks happen and then cut it down

479
00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:39,659
at the start of week nine I mean let

480
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:42,899
nine weeks finish if I said nine weeks

481
00:16:39,659 --> 00:16:44,759
that is 63 full days I want that ninth

482
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:47,578
week to finish you've got to put in that

483
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:49,919
last week don't cut it down a full week

484
00:16:47,578 --> 00:16:51,778
early Let It Go long enough most of what

485
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:53,759
I'm gonna breed and sell to you is going

486
00:16:51,778 --> 00:16:56,100
to take about 70 days so make sure

487
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:59,459
you're letting it go at least nine maybe

488
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:01,379
even ten maybe 11 weeks uh the only real

489
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:03,239
way to tell when that plant is done is

490
00:17:01,379 --> 00:17:05,160
to have a scope maybe a magnifying glass

491
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:06,779
that hooks up to your computer some way

492
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:09,779
to look at the trichomes you need at

493
00:17:06,779 --> 00:17:11,338
least a 60 maybe a 100x scope get in

494
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:13,798
there look at those trichomes when they

495
00:17:11,338 --> 00:17:15,599
are starting to get amber in color is

496
00:17:13,798 --> 00:17:17,578
when it is time to harvest your plants

497
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:19,379
look at a couple of different spots at

498
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:21,359
the plant look at the top look at the

499
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:23,220
Middle look kind of lower the tops are

500
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:24,838
going to be more done the middles won't

501
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:26,338
be done as much and the bottoms are not

502
00:17:24,838 --> 00:17:28,019
nearly as finished on some plants

503
00:17:26,338 --> 00:17:29,519
depending on the size but if you got

504
00:17:28,019 --> 00:17:32,160
large plants they'll finish at different

505
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:33,779
rates look up here see how much look at

506
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,960
the trichomes they're going to go from

507
00:17:33,779 --> 00:17:39,538
clear to like a silvery blue to milky

508
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,519
then they'll start turning Amber when 20

509
00:17:39,538 --> 00:17:43,798
to 30 percent of those trichomes look

510
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:45,480
like you dip them in Dr Pepper that is

511
00:17:43,798 --> 00:17:46,980
when it is time to cut down that plant

512
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,200
but I would look on several different

513
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:50,940
locations of the plant look kind of high

514
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,220
look around the main top look around the

515
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:55,798
secondaries look at the lowers see what

516
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:57,720
color the trichomes are also don't

517
00:17:55,798 --> 00:18:00,179
stress too much on the exact day when

518
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:02,038
you harvest there is a harvest window we

519
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:03,600
like to say it's a harvest window of

520
00:18:02,038 --> 00:18:05,759
peak ripeness it's not going to be right

521
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:07,980
at one day one hour you've got a couple

522
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:10,019
of days of a window some people really

523
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:12,058
overthink and they stress way too hard

524
00:18:10,019 --> 00:18:14,279
on when to harvest their plants as long

525
00:18:12,058 --> 00:18:16,200
as you've got 20 to 30 percent of that

526
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:18,599
Amber trichomes going on on your buds

527
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:20,220
you will have a quality Harvest I

528
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:22,798
recommend letting that first batch go

529
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:24,600
probably 10 maybe 11 weeks pay really

530
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:26,038
close attention to the trichomes pay

531
00:18:24,599 --> 00:18:28,558
really close attention to the health of

532
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:30,960
the plant then I don't recommend doing

533
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:32,819
the 18 6 on the first run I recommend

534
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,380
that on runs after you've learned the

535
00:18:32,819 --> 00:18:36,178
plan out we need to see how long it

536
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:37,799
takes we need to learn when to start

537
00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:39,419
flushing we need to learn when to flip

538
00:18:37,798 --> 00:18:40,918
the light again we need to learn the

539
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:43,200
details of this plant before we start

540
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:46,140
doing too many tricks to it so this

541
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:48,058
first run Let It Go 70 days pay

542
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:50,759
attention to it then maybe next time let

543
00:18:48,058 --> 00:18:52,918
it go 77. let it go too long the first

544
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:54,720
time maybe this is just the first date

545
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:56,520
make a good first date so you can learn

546
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,779
something the second the third the

547
00:18:56,519 --> 00:18:59,400
fourth date that's when things will

548
00:18:57,779 --> 00:19:00,720
really start getting hot build a

549
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,480
relationship with your plants you guys

550
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:05,880
too many people want to grow uh new [ __ ]

551
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:07,319
every time and I feel like you that's

552
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:09,299
fun that's really cool you get new

553
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:11,639
flavors new Aromas a new Buzz every time

554
00:19:09,298 --> 00:19:13,259
but if you pick one or two plants and

555
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:15,360
you grow the [ __ ] out of them for four

556
00:19:13,259 --> 00:19:17,579
or five Cycles you'll learn that like

557
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:19,439
around week three if I defoliate this

558
00:19:17,579 --> 00:19:21,240
one it really starts chunking up around

559
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,919
week six if I give this one a whole

560
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:25,500
bunch of buds well it really takes off

561
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:27,840
if I let this one go 11 weeks it really

562
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:29,160
finishes super fat you'll start learning

563
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:30,839
things like that you'll learn if I give

564
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:32,640
it a little more Cal Mag or if I cut out

565
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:34,439
the Cal Mag or give it a little bit of

566
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,600
this or that at a certain time it really

567
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:38,519
goes shebang start paying attention to

568
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:40,980
the plants dial them in get each

569
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:44,160
cultivar perfected before you add too

570
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:47,460
many more to the mix all right so that

571
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:50,100
is my rant on day one is day one don't

572
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:51,660
let anybody else tell you otherwise I am

573
00:19:50,099 --> 00:19:53,519
the one who puts the numbers on the

574
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:55,620
package I made the seeds I made the

575
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:57,960
package I made the label I did the

576
00:19:55,619 --> 00:20:00,239
testing I know how long they should take

577
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:02,460
so take my advice follow that number

578
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,660
that I put on my package of my seeds

579
