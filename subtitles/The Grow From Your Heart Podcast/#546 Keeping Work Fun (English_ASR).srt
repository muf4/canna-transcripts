and biker Kush on the package the flavor

27
00:01:03,509 --> 00:01:07,349
is described as sour and fuel they

28
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,740
should have followed that up with

29
00:01:07,349 --> 00:01:13,919
[ __ ] delightful I love the flavor of

30

concentrate I'm gonna crack the jar open

34
00:01:21,209 --> 00:01:25,618
and let you see what it looks like that

35
00:01:23,368 --> 00:01:27,118
was the four gram jar of manna for my

36
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:28,799
way about halfway through you can see

37
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:31,530

enjoy the live batter from our friends

40
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:37,408
at Green Dot labs on the back of the

41
00:01:35,578 --> 00:01:40,228
package it does say the product contains

42
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:44,189

44
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:48,359
again big shout-out to our friends at

45
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:51,739
Green Dot labs for the delicious and

46
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:53,909
tremendous headbanger live batter

47
00:01:51,739 --> 00:01:56,218
all right podcast roll they do have a

48
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:58,829
fun show lined up for you before we get

49
00:01:56,218 --> 00:02:01,199
there let's do some shoutouts to a few

50
00:01:58,828 --> 00:02:03,419
of our friends on patreon I do need to

51
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,359
remind you that they have started adding

52
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:08,429
taxes to patreon I don't think any of

53
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:10,649
the things I offer on patreon are

54
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:13,680
taxable since all the things I give you

55
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:14,818
as patreon tiers as rewards our

56
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,560
they're all like thank yous and

57
00:02:14,818 --> 00:02:18,598
shoutouts and I read your question I

58
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,150
don't think those things will be taxable

59
00:02:18,598 --> 00:02:23,310
it is based on your location not my

60
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:25,408
location is based on where you are when

61
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:26,938
you contribute to patreon I tried to

62
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:29,219
adjust all of the tiers to keep things

63
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:31,378
tax free I also have to be honest and

64
00:02:29,219 --> 00:02:34,560
legal I did my best to keep it the same

65
00:02:31,378 --> 00:02:36,179
for everybody I did however increase the

66
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,250
price of a few tiers I did talk about

67
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:39,810
this on a previous episode I just want

68
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,459
to talk about it again because this will

69
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:45,750
take effect by the time this episode

70
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:48,030
comes out there are new tiers on patreon

71
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:49,500
I moved everything up I was getting I

72
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:52,289
make promises that if you contribute to

73
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:54,479
my patreon I will do things for you to

74
00:02:52,289 --> 00:02:56,489
say thank you I was getting overwhelmed

75
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:57,959
I'm not complaining I love the support I

76
00:02:56,489 --> 00:02:59,670
loved the contributions but I wasn't

77
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:01,739
able to keep up with my end of the

78
00:02:59,669 --> 00:03:03,030
agreement people were contributing they

79
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:05,280
were not getting their shoutouts and

80
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:06,840
their questions read to slow that down I

81
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,370
raised the prices normally when you

82
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,280
raise prices you sell less of something

83
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:13,408
ah hopefully you guys just continue you

84
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,598
keep sending me the extra funds that

85
00:03:13,408 --> 00:03:16,949
will result in me doing extra podcasts

86
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:19,168
I'm already trying to find scheduling

87
00:03:16,949 --> 00:03:21,659
time and energy to do another show every

88
00:03:19,169 --> 00:03:23,549
week so there will be some changes in

89
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:25,709
the patreon and there may be changes

90
00:03:23,549 --> 00:03:27,959
coming up in the podcast if the patreon

91
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:29,848

92
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:31,799

00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:53,579
a lot of emails every day I get a lot of

167
00:05:51,329 --> 00:05:55,408
questions every day I focused a lot of

168
00:05:53,579 --> 00:05:57,870
my time on catching up on patreon

169
00:05:55,408 --> 00:05:59,728
messages and questions so if you've been

170
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:01,348
waiting for an email or a reply via

171
00:05:59,728 --> 00:06:04,258
patreon I should have caught up with you

172
00:06:01,348 --> 00:06:07,408
by now if not you are probably next um

173
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:09,780
the emails and musical submissions are

174
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:11,490
also being caught up I've gotten a lot

175
00:06:09,779 --> 00:06:13,019
of great musical submissions you guys

176
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:15,590
good work there are some out there that

177
00:06:13,019 --> 00:06:17,968
were a little bit too much for an intro

178
00:06:15,589 --> 00:06:20,399
keep in mind if you're sending me music

179
00:06:17,968 --> 00:06:23,699
I've got to talk over it so it can't

180
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:25,888
sound like trash cans and trash trucks

181
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:27,090
and it can't be dubstep is what I think

182
00:06:25,889 --> 00:06:29,009
I'm trying to say if it is dubstep

183
00:06:27,089 --> 00:06:30,718
mellow it down in a part where I could

184
00:06:29,009 --> 00:06:31,139
talk don't make the robots battle all at

185
00:06:30,718 --> 00:06:32,848
once

186
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:34,199
I think dubstep sounds like the toaster

187
00:06:32,848 --> 00:06:35,819
in the microwave having a fight but if

188
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:38,759
that's what you're into do your bad

189
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:40,259
thing um but I'm still reviewing the

190
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:41,219
musical submissions there are a couple

191
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:43,199
that I

192
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:45,360
enjoy there are a couple couple of guys

193
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,560
really get my vibe and I've sent a

194
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,790
couple of emails out I asked for

195
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,139
permission to play one on the show

196
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:51,150
tonight but it's a little bit late it

197
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:52,800
was spontaneous when I do have

198
00:06:51,149 --> 00:06:54,659
permission to play the samples and I

199
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,920
know what is expected of me and once

200
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:58,200
we've worked some things out I will

201
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:59,640
debut some really cool music there's

202
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:01,050
some really cool digital music some

203
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:03,199
really cool live music that has been

204
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:06,079
produced for the show even if I don't

205
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:08,610
select the tracks as a permanent

206
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:10,680
start-stop commercial type of track that

207
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:12,240
I play in the show it still may end up

208
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,709
being played on the show at least once

209
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,420
so that you guys can hear these people's

210
00:07:13,709 --> 00:07:17,069
hard work because people put some time

211

into it I make music myself I know what

212

Ripper mail to make it Jack the Ripper

[ __ ] questions some cool had a lot of

291
00:09:56,078 --> 00:10:00,278
answers he was uh miles ahead of me in

292
00:09:58,929 --> 00:10:02,229
this industry he was doing the same

293
00:10:00,278 --> 00:10:03,730
thing I'm doing but he's faced a lot of

294
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:05,170
the trials and tribulations and had a

295
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:06,909
lot of the questions so he's got a lot

296
00:10:05,169 --> 00:10:07,149
of the [ __ ] answers that I need right

297
00:10:06,909 --> 00:10:09,219
now

298
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:11,649
ah so wish some of you was around but I

299
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:14,170
have got a Jack the Ripper mail plant in

300
00:10:11,649 --> 00:10:16,389
a room I have got for Jack the Ripper

301
00:10:14,169 --> 00:10:19,028
females in a room I have narrowed down

302
00:10:16,389 --> 00:10:21,579
my selections to where I know which

303
00:10:19,028 --> 00:10:23,828
three Jack the Ripper females I'm gonna

304
00:10:21,578 --> 00:10:25,359
keep maybe two I've got a good idea

305
00:10:23,828 --> 00:10:27,308
numbers two and four that doesn't make

306
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,220
any difference to you though when I drew

307
00:10:27,308 --> 00:10:31,509
them I labeled them one through ten um

308
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:33,519
number one happened to be the [ __ ]

309
00:10:31,509 --> 00:10:34,509
best male he was a stud from the

310
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,039
beginning I was like that one right

311
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:37,449
there I liked it labeled at number one

312
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:39,429
it's what I was looking for this whole

313
00:10:37,448 --> 00:10:42,008
project was based on finding a jtr male

314
00:10:39,429 --> 00:10:43,539
so I labeled him number one and I

315
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:44,528
labeled an ex plant number two the next

316
00:10:43,539 --> 00:10:46,899
one number three the next one number

317
00:10:44,528 --> 00:10:48,399
four down the line up to ten uh as they

318
00:10:46,899 --> 00:10:49,808
grew and look shitty I got rid of that

319
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,938
not not shitty but not up to my

320
00:10:49,808 --> 00:10:54,370
standards for breeding I eliminated that

321
00:10:51,938 --> 00:10:56,828
not keepers i shun the non-believers

322
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:58,360
then I was left with five oh there's a

323
00:10:56,828 --> 00:10:59,078
male and four girls I think I've

324
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:02,589
eliminated

325
00:10:59,078 --> 00:11:04,629
number five doesn't root well ah and I

326
00:11:02,589 --> 00:11:05,769
think two and four are the keepers and I

327
00:11:04,629 --> 00:11:07,389
think seven is the one that's

328
00:11:05,769 --> 00:11:08,310
questionable that might stick around

329
00:11:07,389 --> 00:11:10,889
we'll grow

330
00:11:08,309 --> 00:11:12,959
but one two and four are the keepers

331
00:11:10,889 --> 00:11:14,759
those are the champs so I've got some

332
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:17,070
Jack the Ripper Jack the Ripper male

333
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:19,980
some Jack the Ripper girls the Jack the

334
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:21,629
Ripper male has successfully pollinated

335
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:23,490
I said in a couple episodes ago it

336
00:11:21,629 --> 00:11:25,649
looked like the pollination worked that

337
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:27,149
room is seated those pistols are brown

338
00:11:25,649 --> 00:11:28,949
they're crinkled up the calyxes are

339
00:11:27,149 --> 00:11:31,709
stuffed with seeds the plants look

340
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:33,150
amazing they're nice and pregnant what

341
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:35,490
have we pollinated I've been hinting

342
00:11:33,149 --> 00:11:36,659
slowly on the show at the strains that

343
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:39,839
I've got in there that are getting

344
00:11:36,659 --> 00:11:42,329
pollinated by the jtr of course I think

345
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:44,580
I've mentioned there is an arise plant

346
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:46,650
in that mix part of the idea of making

347
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:49,020
the Jack the Ripper cross was to cross

348
00:11:46,649 --> 00:11:50,519
sub cools plant to one of my popular

349
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:52,949
plants which of course would be the

350
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:55,620
arize so there's a female arise we will

351
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:56,790
have a rise X Jack the Ripper you always

352
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:58,470
list the ladies first when you're

353
00:11:56,789 --> 00:12:01,829
listening genetics so it'd be a rise

354
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:04,019
cross to Jack the Ripper also I put a

355
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:05,580
golden goat female in there we've talked

356
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:07,500
about that previously on the show people

357
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:08,850
are sending me name suggestions I'll

358
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,710
reveal some of those on the show I'll

359
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:12,389
share some of those I of course will

360
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:14,339
reveal the names of these crosses on the

361
00:12:12,389 --> 00:12:16,559
show as well there's a golden goat in

362
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:17,790
there lots of great name suggestions in

363
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:20,309
the comments thank you guys

364
00:12:17,789 --> 00:12:21,899
there is a blueberry cookies female in

365
00:12:20,309 --> 00:12:24,149
there so we will have blueberry cookies

366
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:26,399
cross to the Jack the Ripper

367
00:12:24,149 --> 00:12:28,110
um I think with the blueberry cookies

368
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,480
we're going to get the blueberry cookies

369
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:32,250
flavor and potency but I think the Jack

370
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,019
the Ripper is going to give it a more

371
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:36,509
bubblegum sweetness the Jack the Ripper

372
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:37,939
that I have selected the phenotypes I'm

373
00:12:36,509 --> 00:12:40,350
finding in the room have a bubblegum

374
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:42,240
strawberry sweetness maybe a watermelon

375
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:43,759
sort of a thing so I think out of the

376
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,799
blueberry cookies we're gonna get like

377
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:48,720
strawberry blueberry skittles II uh

378
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:50,279
I smell Laffy Taffy when I think about

379
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,810
it my brain smells the pink and purple

380
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:54,179
Laffy Taffy so that's what my brain

381
00:12:51,809 --> 00:12:55,979
thinks I also put a platinum tangi in

382
00:12:54,179 --> 00:12:57,929
there that platinum tan she's a great

383
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:59,610
plant it's a very good breeder but I've

384
00:12:57,929 --> 00:13:02,159
noticed all of its offspring are not

385
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:03,899
major monster growers I'm wondering if

386
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:05,519
this Jack the Ripper will make it bigger

387
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:06,958
that's what I'm going for four there so

388
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,549
there's a platinum tangi there's

389
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:10,679
blueberry cookies there's golden goat

390
00:13:08,549 --> 00:13:12,750
and of course there is a rise there are

391
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:14,338
a few more other ladies in there I will

392
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,720
reveal more of those as time goes on

393
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:17,760
there's no need to spill all of the

394
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,959
beans on one show I got to keep your

395
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:21,088
attention got to keep you coming back

396
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:21,739
for more somehow so that is a garden

397
00:13:21,089 --> 00:13:23,330
update

398
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:25,639
of course all of those plants are

399
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:28,610
underneath a cannon underneath two

400
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:32,899
cannon LED lights in a five by five 10 I

401
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:35,840
am loving the cannon LEDs after vegging

402
00:13:32,899 --> 00:13:37,909
one round under the cannon LEDs I went

403
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:40,460
back to Keith and I bought three more so

404
00:13:37,909 --> 00:13:43,069
now I've got five cannons running the

405
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:47,120
entire veg space myclone area my mom

406
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:49,730
area is all cannon LEDs I'm going to

407
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,740
finish this flower run in a small room

408
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:53,659
with cannons and see how I like the

409
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:55,850
finished product and if I completely

410
00:13:53,659 --> 00:13:57,529
approve with the seed production and the

411
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:59,240
way that everything goes and grow so far

412
00:13:57,529 --> 00:14:02,149
we're half way in and I'm [ __ ] happy

413
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:04,730
so if that continues I may I probably

414
00:14:02,149 --> 00:14:07,459
will replace all of the lights in my

415
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:10,070
personal flowering space with cannon

416
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:11,840
LEDs or I'm gonna try to be really

417
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:13,940
patient and get to be a tester for some

418
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:15,550
of his new [ __ ] because I heard there's

419
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:17,570
new things coming down the pipeline

420
00:14:15,549 --> 00:14:19,629
probably not supposed to say that

421
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:21,920
shout out Keith getting you some hype

422
00:14:19,629 --> 00:14:24,169
alright what do we want to move forward

423
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:28,849
from here I think this is a good time to

424
00:14:24,169 --> 00:14:30,889
segue into the patreon question for this

425
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:32,629
episode I've only got one email for this

426
00:14:30,889 --> 00:14:35,000
episode I thought it was a really good

427
00:14:32,629 --> 00:14:37,039
question it also works with another

428
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,500
question that another podcaster and

429
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:41,809
fellow grower asked me so let's start

430
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:44,210
with V email part that was sent in by a

431
00:14:41,809 --> 00:14:45,889
listener then I'll also add on the other

432
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:48,560
part that my friend attached and then I

433
00:14:45,889 --> 00:14:51,679
will get on a nice little ramble here

434
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:54,169
about this topic so this one comes from

435
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:55,849
a person let's see they did not sign

436
00:14:54,169 --> 00:14:59,059
their name I don't think they want their

437
00:14:55,850 --> 00:15:01,460
name said easy enough for me let's get

438
00:14:59,059 --> 00:15:02,899
to the point it goes hey hey just was

439
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:04,940
high as hell and wondered if growing

440
00:15:02,899 --> 00:15:07,370
commercially has taken the fun out of

441
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:09,920
growing for you bro that's all for now

442
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:11,990
I'm waiting on my new canon to pop some

443
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:14,779
orange chasm seeds take care

444
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:17,090
PS here's my favorite part PS kombucha

445
00:15:14,779 --> 00:15:19,189
makes me poo and that's how the news

446
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:21,050
goes they didn't sign their name but I

447
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:23,360
think this is a great question they're

448
00:15:21,049 --> 00:15:26,120
asking if growing commercially has taken

449
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,259
the fun out of growing for me then they

450
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:29,120
also said they're waiting for their

451
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:31,429
Canon LED so this person's got some

452
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,960
canons and some orange gasm seeds you're

453
00:15:31,429 --> 00:15:35,120
gonna have a good time with that I have

454
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,690
seen the orange gasm under canons they

455
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,460
do vary

456
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:39,740
well I think with that one cannon you

457
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:42,050
probably want to run about a 3x3 maybe a

458
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:43,940
4x4 space at the at the most

459
00:15:42,049 --> 00:15:45,439
keep that uh that light a little bit

460
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:47,180
above that ceiling and as the seedling

461
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,490
grows it that light closer and closer

462
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:51,199
we're off topic I'm just excited that

463
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:53,029
you've got my genetics and a like run by

464
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,560
my friend I made by my friend now I

465
00:15:53,029 --> 00:15:56,329
recommend you get some new millennium

466
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:58,189
nutrients and you do the trifecta bro

467
00:15:56,330 --> 00:16:00,050
you can't go wrong that way also you

468
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:02,600
need a peel grill minder unit in that

469
00:16:00,049 --> 00:16:03,949
temp to make sure everything's Irie she

470
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,500
can't go wrong if you got I read

471
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:08,360
genetics a peel minder unit if you've

472
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,950
got a canon light and you've got some

473
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:12,110
new millennium nutrients you were

474
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:14,660
setting yourself up for success you've

475
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:16,850
got the [ __ ] Ferrari the keys the

476
00:16:14,659 --> 00:16:18,620
fast tires you got cool paint you're

477
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:20,029
ready to shred it let's get my high ass

478
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:22,850
back on track cuz there was a question

479
00:16:20,029 --> 00:16:23,990
here also kombucha makes me poo that's a

480
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:25,310
good thing bro you don't need that stuff

481
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:27,440
sit in there for too long I probably

482
00:16:25,309 --> 00:16:29,989
needed to come out it'll fix your your

483
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:34,030
guts right up now as commercial growing

484
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:36,230
takin the fun out of growing for me um

485
00:16:34,029 --> 00:16:38,329
no because I won't let it

486
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:39,889
I live to have a good time I look like a

487

490
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:47,779
backwards hat and I'm [ __ ] 41 years

491
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:49,970
old ah I come across fairly serious I

492
00:16:47,779 --> 00:16:52,819
get [ __ ] done people can rely on me I

493
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:54,800
like to give the yep the appearance the

494
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:56,240
presentation that people can rely on me

495
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:58,399
I can get [ __ ] done that's what I like

496
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,500
to give off I even be in a stoner with

497
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:02,509
dreadlocks and whatever I still like to

498
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,980
give people confidence that I can get

499
00:17:02,509 --> 00:17:07,039
[ __ ] done so I seem kind of serious

500
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:09,078
especially being uh in charge being the

501
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:10,879
boss peon whatever the lead grower the

502
00:17:09,078 --> 00:17:14,029
team leader the cultivation director at

503
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:16,069
a facility it can become stressful there

504
00:17:14,029 --> 00:17:18,379
are a lot of things to worry about I am

505
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:20,389
the person between upper management and

506
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:21,920
the employees so when they employees

507
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:22,910
[ __ ] up I gotta yell at them and it's

508
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,920
hard I don't like yelling at people

509
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:26,600
they're my friends or my they're my

510
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:28,310
buddies we dab after work we hang out

511
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:30,109
and [ __ ] but I also don't like getting

512
00:17:28,309 --> 00:17:33,139
yelled at by management so it's a

513
00:17:30,109 --> 00:17:35,000
[ __ ] it's a weird place to be I don't

514
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:37,430
I don't like being I don't like being

515
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,529
the disciplinarian kind of person so I

516
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:41,090
don't let it suck the fun out of it

517
00:17:39,529 --> 00:17:43,160
because we are there to have fun

518
00:17:41,089 --> 00:17:45,079
I let the first person that shows up to

519
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:47,179
the grow select the music for the day so

520
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:48,439
if you're the first grow tech there you

521
00:17:47,179 --> 00:17:49,490
get to go in the back and you get to

522
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,750
select music if you're the

523
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:52,400
first tremor there you get to go up

524
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:53,839
front you get to select music there's a

525
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,290
big divide between the two parts of the

526
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:55,939
building

527
00:17:54,289 --> 00:17:57,349
I can't hear tremor music when I'm in

528
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:59,029
the back I can't her grow her music when

529
00:17:57,349 --> 00:18:01,099
I look toward the front so the first

530
00:17:59,029 --> 00:18:03,170
person in each part gets to select music

531
00:18:01,099 --> 00:18:04,579
that gives a person a little bit of

532
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:06,800
groove they're there they're first there

533
00:18:04,579 --> 00:18:08,720
kicking ass that makes it fun I put the

534
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:10,970
music up loud I don't care what you want

535
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,130
to play I'll give you like 45 minutes of

536
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:14,990
whatever you want if it's gangster rap

537
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:17,480
if it's hip-hop if it's [ __ ] Swedish

538
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:18,620
country folk death metal I'm in if

539
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:20,210
that's what you want to hear and you

540
00:18:18,619 --> 00:18:22,039
were first let's do it but we're gonna

541
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:23,029
switch it up throw the turd there before

542
00:18:22,039 --> 00:18:24,170
a break we're gonna change it when we

543
00:18:23,029 --> 00:18:26,149
come back from break it's definitely

544
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:27,980
gonna be different when we go to break

545
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:29,059
we'll know after we go take a dab or two

546
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:31,910
we'll come back we'll know what to put

547
00:18:29,058 --> 00:18:32,808
on after that ah but I don't let it suck

548
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:35,450
the fun out of it

549
00:18:32,808 --> 00:18:37,308
I walk through the grow I make sure that

550
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:38,840
all the guy I assigned tasks for

551
00:18:37,308 --> 00:18:41,119
multiple guys I get them going they're

552
00:18:38,839 --> 00:18:42,949
doing their thing right I know that this

553
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:45,229
guy doesn't really enjoy doing this job

554
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:46,490
so I'm gonna walk by him every couple of

555
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:49,429
minutes and tell him he looks [ __ ]

556
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:50,870
good doing his job he knows I'm [ __ ]

557
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:53,000
with him he knows I'm just [ __ ]

558
00:18:50,869 --> 00:18:55,879
patronizing him but it's fun it keeps us

559
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,039
he knows he's doing a job that sucks but

560
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:59,809
the boss is acknowledging it and I go

561
00:18:58,039 --> 00:19:01,759
check on every guy so say I've got five

562
00:18:59,808 --> 00:19:03,109
guys growing I've got them all doing

563
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:04,429
separate things maybe two guys are

564
00:19:03,109 --> 00:19:05,928
putting up trellis one guys doing

565
00:19:04,429 --> 00:19:07,730
transplants one guys cutting clones and

566
00:19:05,929 --> 00:19:08,870
one guys doing some [ __ ] I'll bounce

567
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:10,099
through all the guys and make sure

568
00:19:08,869 --> 00:19:11,239
they're all doing something that they

569
00:19:10,099 --> 00:19:12,558
need to be doing make sure they don't

570
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,420
need help if they need help I'll help

571
00:19:12,558 --> 00:19:15,950
them ah the guy's putting a trellis I'm

572
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:17,900
six five if they need a guy to go run

573
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:19,519
[ __ ] zip ties down the poles I'll zip

574
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:21,380
tie the [ __ ] out of it keep him up catch

575
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:23,450
them up while they're doing it I'll

576
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:26,059
[ __ ] I shoot and holler like Ric

577
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:27,950
Flair if we accomplish something and we

578
00:19:26,058 --> 00:19:29,389
get lunch ten minutes early you'll hear

579
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:30,950
me go whoa

580
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:32,450
cuz we get to go to lunch 10 minutes

581
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:33,529
[ __ ] early we're gonna go have a good

582
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:35,090
time we're gonna that means he get two

583
00:19:33,529 --> 00:19:38,058
more dabs in is what that really means

584
00:19:35,089 --> 00:19:40,129
so a hoot and holler I [ __ ] scream

585
00:19:38,058 --> 00:19:41,899
and yell I had nothing bad I'm like

586
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:43,520

587
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:44,600

588
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:46,279
you just gotta have a good time in there

589
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:47,719
I think keeping morale up really helps

590
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:48,920
so I go check on the guys hanging

591
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,870
trellis then I'll go look at the guys

592
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:52,370
transplanting when they're transplanting

593
00:19:50,869 --> 00:19:54,409
I'll walk by if they look like they've

594
00:19:52,369 --> 00:19:55,879
fallen behind I'll catch them up I can

595
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:57,440

596
00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:00,350
[ __ ] so I get my hands dirty I do a

597
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:02,390

598
00:20:00,349 --> 00:20:03,959

600
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,990
you guys keep it going if it's just a

601
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:08,190
couple bros if it's a lady I won't say

602
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:09,420

603
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:10,769
you know what I mean I'll say you guys

604
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:12,750

606
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:15,960
random they know what I'm doing but it

607
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:17,430
still feels good we're bonding

608
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:19,079
they're not just sucking at work all day

609
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:20,640
so then I go find the other guy who's

610
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:21,960

611

618

628

leave the parking lot it's cuz they

647
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:25,740
don't got no weed or no money I'll buy

648
00:21:24,329 --> 00:21:27,839
pizza the next day just to keep those

649
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:29,670
guys [ __ ] fed one meal will get your

650
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:32,459
[ __ ] crew back back on your team it

651
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:34,710
prevents a mutiny so I'm Ric Flair in

652
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:36,569
the [ __ ] girl I go whoa all day long

653
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:38,670
[ __ ] you know I'm coming I cannot

654
00:21:36,569 --> 00:21:42,299
sneak up on you I'm loud we have a good

655
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:43,680
time we're bros I love growing so it

656
00:21:42,299 --> 00:21:45,930
hasn't sucked the fun out of it because

657
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:48,090
I make it fun part of my job is to make

658
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:49,410
it fun I get to do different tasks every

659
00:21:48,089 --> 00:21:51,119
day I was saying I get to help all the

660
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:53,070
guys at different stations that means I

661
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:54,839
get to do different [ __ ] every single

662
00:21:53,069 --> 00:21:58,019
day and I learn new stuff by doing that

663
00:21:54,839 --> 00:22:00,240
I love learning I'm passionately curious

664
00:21:58,019 --> 00:22:03,299
is what I think the term is I love that

665
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:05,670
so it has not sucked the fun out of

666
00:22:03,299 --> 00:22:08,609
growing for me because I just simply

667
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:10,440
won't let it um I make it fun I love it

668
00:22:08,609 --> 00:22:13,439
and it's never gonna stop being fun

669
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:15,029
el-amin segue into the second part I was

670
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,990
on a live chat with my friend Scottie

671
00:22:15,029 --> 00:22:19,539
real and a few other folks

672
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:21,339
and Scottie real dropped a question he

673
00:22:19,539 --> 00:22:23,139
said man with all of the technology and

674
00:22:21,339 --> 00:22:26,470
all of the things we have learned as

675
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:28,990
growing become easier or harder for you

676
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:30,940
and there are a couple of good answers

677
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:35,019
from me for that question

678
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:36,759
um I am at a level where I call myself a

679
00:22:35,019 --> 00:22:38,440
black belt grower I don't try to be

680
00:22:36,759 --> 00:22:40,720
egotistical about it I don't try to

681
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:42,970
boast I just know that I'm confident and

682
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,980
if there's a grow issue a plant issue a

683
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:47,200
commercial cultivation issue a small

684
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:48,940
grow issue a breeding question I can

685
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,650
probably cover and answer the question

686
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:52,420
without much research sometimes I gotta

687
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:53,740
go I don't know let me check a couple of

688
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:56,289
resources so I don't give you wrong

689
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:59,640
details but for the most part I know the

690
00:22:56,289 --> 00:23:01,990
answers so I'm like a black belt grower

691
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:04,570
with being a black belt grower there's a

692
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:06,490
lot of information I know how to do a

693
00:23:04,569 --> 00:23:07,869
lot of [ __ ] hypothetically I know how to

694
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:09,549
throw a lot of kicks and a lot of

695
00:23:07,869 --> 00:23:11,709
[ __ ] blocks but that also gives me a

696
00:23:09,549 --> 00:23:13,869
lot of decisions to make which kick in

697
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:15,490
which block do I throw sometimes you got

698
00:23:13,869 --> 00:23:17,469
to make a decision on the fly you really

699
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:18,789
hope you block that right punch and you

700
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:21,429
don't get hit with a [ __ ] left punch

701
00:23:18,789 --> 00:23:23,170
on accident ah I hope you guys follow my

702
00:23:21,429 --> 00:23:24,580
karate analogies it's [ __ ] simple for

703
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:26,850
me I'm a black belt grower you know

704
00:23:24,579 --> 00:23:29,129
where I'm going so

705
00:23:26,849 --> 00:23:31,169
is growing harder or easier now that I'm

706
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:33,450
a black belt grower I've been given not

707
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:35,730
given but I've got the controls the keys

708
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:39,090
the driver's seat and the codes the

709
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:41,400
launch codes to several large commercial

710
00:23:39,089 --> 00:23:43,889
cultivation facilities I could make

711
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:45,960
those facilities and those jobs as hard

712
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:48,180
as I wanted to make them there is a lot

713
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:50,910
of [ __ ] to go wrong in a commercial

714
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:53,700
cultivation facility when I train new

715
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:54,930
people and agro the first it usually

716
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:56,400
they start in the middle of the day we

717
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:58,259
hire them they come in about lunchtime

718
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,790
the second day they meet me at the door

719
00:23:58,259 --> 00:24:01,230
to go in at 8:00 or 9:00 in the morning

720
00:23:59,789 --> 00:24:03,690
or 7:00 in the morning wherever we are

721
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:06,720
as I'm turning off the alarm I go okay

722
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:08,880
here is the fun part the first thing we

723
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:11,279
do at every grow after you turn off the

724
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:14,160
alarm and clock in is find what went

725
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:16,170
wrong last night I know it sounds shitty

726
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:17,730
but there are a lot of moving parts

727
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:19,470
there's more to break there's more to

728
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:21,990
maintain there's more to take care of

729
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:24,569
there is more to find what the [ __ ] went

730
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:25,980
wrong last night some of my facilities

731
00:24:24,569 --> 00:24:28,230
have five to seven hundred lights

732
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:29,910
something went wrong there are pumps

733
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:31,860
there fans there are a lot of moving

734
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:33,330
parts something went wrong so every day

735
00:24:31,859 --> 00:24:35,009
we got to walk in and find out what went

736
00:24:33,329 --> 00:24:38,250
wrong sometimes that's the hardest part

737
00:24:35,009 --> 00:24:39,539
of commercial growing also

738
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:41,640
commercial growing is everything you're

739
00:24:39,539 --> 00:24:44,430
doing at scale mixing nutrients you can

740
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:45,780
really make a mistake if you put in if

741
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:48,000
you do the math wrong if you're trying

742
00:24:45,779 --> 00:24:50,369
to add 450 gallons you accidentally do 7

743
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,049
milliliters times 50 instead of 5 you

744
00:24:50,369 --> 00:24:53,609
just did a lot more nutrients on

745
00:24:52,049 --> 00:24:56,909
accident your mistakes can be much

746
00:24:53,609 --> 00:24:58,889
larger so it's easier but it's also

747
00:24:56,910 --> 00:25:01,769
harder but I don't let it get too

748
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:04,230
difficult I try to keep it simple stoner

749
00:25:01,769 --> 00:25:05,519
ah the more parts you add the more [ __ ]

750
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:08,039
that can break so I try to keep a

751
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:09,779
commercial grow reliable and

752
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:11,759
self-sufficient I don't like to water by

753
00:25:09,779 --> 00:25:14,279
myself by hand I like an auto watering

754
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:16,259
system but it's not harder because I can

755
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:17,579
see the issues I've learned to read the

756
00:25:16,259 --> 00:25:19,410
plants that makes things a lot easier

757
00:25:17,579 --> 00:25:23,129
I've learned to calm the [ __ ] down

758
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:25,050
my grower panic button is much pressed

759
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:26,610
less much often when I was a new grower

760
00:25:25,049 --> 00:25:27,899
and I would see something weird in the

761
00:25:26,609 --> 00:25:30,059
plants I call it the panic button you

762
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:31,680
just go oh [ __ ] I have to flush I have

763
00:25:30,059 --> 00:25:33,149
to spray I have to defoliate I have to

764
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:35,370
call 6 friends and find out what they

765
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:36,630
think I should do now I go huh those

766
00:25:35,369 --> 00:25:38,369
leaves look like [ __ ] I wonder what we

767
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:41,430
did and I just think about it I solved

768
00:25:38,369 --> 00:25:43,739
the problem so in the sense of my

769
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:45,570
knowledge growing is much easier with

770
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:48,359
all of the technologies [ __ ] can become

771
00:25:45,569 --> 00:25:50,129
way difficult we've got controllers and

772
00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:52,069
watering controllers and light

773
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:55,110
controllers and climate controllers and

774
00:25:52,069 --> 00:25:56,819
gigantic HVAC systems I don't understand

775
00:25:55,109 --> 00:25:59,039
some of the J I don't understand most of

776
00:25:56,819 --> 00:26:00,899
the giant HVAC systems so when they

777
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:03,240
break that's hard for me that's the hard

778
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:05,009
part is maintaining all of the gear the

779
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:07,140
hard part is maintaining the staff the

780
00:26:05,009 --> 00:26:10,410
hard part is maintaining scheduling for

781
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:12,990
rooms employees vacations plants

782
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:14,279
transplants [ __ ] inspections that's

783
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:15,930
the hard part it's not really the

784
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:18,569
growing I'm a black belt grower I can

785
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:20,670
handle 99% of what you throw at me as a

786
00:26:18,569 --> 00:26:23,789
grower now most of what I've said is

787
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:25,920
relating to a commercial grow let's talk

788
00:26:23,789 --> 00:26:27,960
about a home grow in a home grow you

789
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:31,350
would be surprised at how much of a

790
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:33,900
caveman grow I run I have got vented

791
00:26:31,349 --> 00:26:36,269
lights with a carbon filter and a blower

792
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:36,720
blowing air over the vented light out of

793
00:26:36,269 --> 00:26:38,910
a window

794
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,589
that's my light setup thousand watt HBS

795
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:42,420
lights for my breeding in my main area

796
00:26:40,589 --> 00:26:44,309
like I said they may switch to be

797
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:48,060
cannons but for now that's what we've

798
00:26:44,309 --> 00:26:49,289
got the lights are plugged into a the

799
00:26:48,059 --> 00:26:51,889
blue one what's it called the blue

800
00:26:49,289 --> 00:26:53,240
control box power box I've got the one

801
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:55,220
controls for lights with the two

802
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:57,769
accessory switches on there and that is

803
00:26:55,220 --> 00:27:00,110
set on 1212 what else is in there a

804
00:26:57,769 --> 00:27:02,900
couple of fans everything is lifted up

805
00:27:00,109 --> 00:27:04,339
off the ground uh very low-tech is just

806
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:05,630
so the plants aren't touching the floor

807
00:27:04,339 --> 00:27:08,178
because I don't like my plants on the

808
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:10,340
floor floor gets cold I like them lifted

809
00:27:08,179 --> 00:27:12,320
up very low-tech three gallon pots

810
00:27:10,339 --> 00:27:13,669
[ __ ] some sticks sometimes I do

811
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:15,200
trellising in that room I move the

812
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:18,500
plants a lot so I prefer the sticks in

813
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:21,410
there but my technology for my personal

814
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:23,929
grow is very simple keep it simple

815
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:25,970
stoner that keeps it really easy

816
00:27:23,929 --> 00:27:27,740
the only things they can really die I've

817
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:29,329
got an air conditioner the things that

818
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:31,429
could really break in the room the

819
00:27:29,329 --> 00:27:33,740
ballast could burn out the light bulbs

820
00:27:31,429 --> 00:27:35,780
could burn out the fan could die the air

821
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:38,140
conditioner could die or the power box

822
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:40,339
could die but those are about my major

823
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:42,110
pieces of equipment that I would have to

824
00:27:40,339 --> 00:27:43,730
replace or the pl minor units and

825
00:27:42,109 --> 00:27:47,329
they're telling me what's going on also

826
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:50,240
I've got a high temp shutoff switch my

827
00:27:47,329 --> 00:27:52,639
power box plugs into so I've got a piece

828
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:55,849
that plugs into my main plug the power

829
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:57,559
box plugs into that the piece has a

830
00:27:55,849 --> 00:27:59,480
thermometer that hangs in the middle of

831
00:27:57,558 --> 00:28:01,428
the room if the temperature exceeds a

832
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:03,319
hundred degrees it cuts the power to

833
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:05,419
everything in the room everything shuts

834
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:07,668
off not everything the fans in the air

835
00:28:05,419 --> 00:28:09,830
conditioner may stay on depending on how

836
00:28:07,669 --> 00:28:11,390
I've got the plugs configured but my

837
00:28:09,829 --> 00:28:13,009
cooling will stay on the lights will go

838
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:14,419
off that way the lights don't continue

839
00:28:13,009 --> 00:28:15,589
to roast the room mainly I've got the

840
00:28:14,419 --> 00:28:17,690
lights plugged into that most of the

841
00:28:15,589 --> 00:28:19,668
time so the lights will turn off I'll

842
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:21,919
rescue the room then I'll get a

843
00:28:19,669 --> 00:28:23,120
notification from the PL minder unit it

844
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:24,620
will say bro it's a hundred and five

845
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:26,089
degrees in the room the lights went off

846
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:28,129
we don't know what the [ __ ] happenin I

847
00:28:26,089 --> 00:28:29,659
can either drive home or I can walk to

848
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:32,750
the grow room and see what's going on

849
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:35,269
and solve the issue so I mainly like to

850
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:37,220
keep it simple stoner in my personal

851
00:28:35,269 --> 00:28:39,379
grows that keeps it easy nothing can

852
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:41,360
break it makes it easier to grow when

853
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:43,640
I'm spinning and the commercial grow we

854
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:46,428
spend a lot of time cleaning filters

855
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:49,490
cleaning nozzles cleaning sprayer jets

856
00:28:46,429 --> 00:28:51,230
ah cleaning the dehumidifier there is a

857
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:52,849
lot of cleaning to be done so it's not

858
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:54,440
harder but it's more maintenance and a

859
00:28:52,849 --> 00:28:56,149
personal grow I've got an air

860
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:58,190
conditioner I don't have a dehumidifier

861
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:59,509
or a humidifier in that room I let the

862
00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:00,830
plants and the [ __ ] rest of the

863
00:28:59,509 --> 00:29:02,329
equipment kind of do that part it's

864
00:29:00,829 --> 00:29:05,029
Colorado it's kind of easy in my room to

865
00:29:02,329 --> 00:29:06,439
dial that in ah I let you

866
00:29:05,029 --> 00:29:07,639
we do all the work for me I think I lost

867
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,930
track of my [ __ ] train of thought

868
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:11,690
there but I don't have a lot of

869
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:13,340
equipment so I can spend more time not

870
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:15,140
so much time cleaning filters cleaning

871
00:29:13,339 --> 00:29:16,579
[ __ ] I'm just cleaning one air

872
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:17,840
conditioner filter and that's about

873
00:29:16,579 --> 00:29:19,250
really all I got to clean in there I got

874
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:20,599
a mop the floor occasionally I got a

875
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:22,220
[ __ ] spray things down and cleaned

876
00:29:20,599 --> 00:29:23,929
[ __ ] up and change the bulbs and I

877
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:26,299
cleaned the glass the glass between the

878
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:27,950
bulb and the [ __ ] plants there's a

879
00:29:26,299 --> 00:29:29,240
little glass bulb in there so the heat

880
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:31,009
stays in there and the air moves it out

881
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:32,660
I cleaned that quite frequently

882
00:29:31,009 --> 00:29:34,519
but there's not a lot of moving parts to

883
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:36,410
take care of so that gives me so much

884
00:29:34,519 --> 00:29:38,119
more time to play and focus on the

885
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:40,370
plants I don't have to touch so much

886
00:29:38,119 --> 00:29:43,459
working parts and machinery less [ __ ] to

887
00:29:40,369 --> 00:29:46,669
break Lester a place that keeps it more

888
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:48,200
fun um does commercial growing suck the

889
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:49,940
fun out of it was the original question

890
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:52,549
that got me triggered on this sometimes

891
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:54,650
it's stressful but I keep it fun in

892
00:29:52,549 --> 00:29:56,779
there then I know that I get to come

893
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:59,300
home and do whatever I want and that

894
00:29:56,779 --> 00:30:01,039
grow if I want to run in and run around

895
00:29:59,299 --> 00:30:02,599
in there with no clothes and no shoes

896
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:04,549
and just my earbuds in my ears and

897
00:30:02,599 --> 00:30:06,709
listen to Joe Rogan talk about aliens I

898
00:30:04,549 --> 00:30:08,389
can do that if I want to wear my full-on

899
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:10,430
clothes just to get that other image out

900
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:12,320
of your head and my shoes and still I

901
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:14,330
have Joe Rogan in my headphones I can do

902
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:15,919
that if I want to sit on a five gallon

903
00:30:14,329 --> 00:30:17,750
bucket and smoke a joint I don't smoke

904
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:20,000
in the grow room but if I wanted to I

905
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:22,849
could sit on a five gallon bucket smoke

906
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,250
a joint listen to uh the fighter and the

907
00:30:22,849 --> 00:30:26,959
kid in my headphones or on their [ __ ]

908
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:27,950
radio nice and loud I don't have to

909
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,110
worry about anybody in there it's my

910
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:31,490
personal grow if I want to cut down all

911
00:30:30,109 --> 00:30:33,139
these plants cuz it looks like fun I

912
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:35,059
could cut them all down if I want to

913
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:37,340
light him on fire we could do it ah I

914
00:30:35,059 --> 00:30:39,500
got my own personal gross so I'll never

915
00:30:37,339 --> 00:30:42,230
quit having fun and my personal grow I'm

916
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:44,119
a breeder I find two plants and I make

917
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:46,039
them [ __ ] I'm gonna make seeds and then

918
00:30:44,119 --> 00:30:48,319
I get to grow those seeds I'm like

919
00:30:46,039 --> 00:30:50,359
making packages of baseball cards and

920
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:52,730
looking for Mickey Mantle's all day but

921
00:30:50,359 --> 00:30:54,529
I'm printing the cards so that's a lot

922
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:58,190
of fun fino hunts are fun breeding is

923
00:30:54,529 --> 00:31:00,379
fun watching what you do with my seeds

924
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:02,059
is a lot of fun I send seed packs out

925
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:03,890

926
00:31:02,059 --> 00:31:06,319
I get to see what you did with my

927
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:09,410
creations that is really fun to me

928
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:12,409
so commercial growing can be stressful

929
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:15,080
but I handle stress with a big smile um

930
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:16,640
I don't take [ __ ] like it's [ __ ] I take

931
00:31:15,079 --> 00:31:18,619
[ __ ] like it's life because shit's

bug you

934

weak the dog is gonna bite you more I

936
00:31:21,778 --> 00:31:25,109
