harvest season in Canada yes and also in

51
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:04,879
call and many other places across our

52
00:02:02,118 --> 00:02:06,599
beautiful continent here it says do you

53
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:09,679
have or have you ever washed your

54
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:13,039
outdoor crop for outdoor contaminants if

55
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:14,800
so is there a process that you recommend

56
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:16,878
yes I have done this before I have seen

57
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,800
this done a lot I've actually washed an

58
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:20,598
indoor crop because a facility that I

59
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,360
worked in uh they hired me to kind of

60
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:24,238
rescue this facility and they were in

61
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:26,160
the middle of a a flowering phase and

62
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,480
that crop had a bunch of weird stuff on

63
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:30,159
it just dirt and debris and possibly

64
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:32,719
bugs and I felt like it was pretty

65
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:35,239
filthy so we even washed an indoor crop

66
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:36,519
uh just to be extra careful but yes uh

67
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:38,519
let's talk about this a little bit

68
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:40,959
you've got plants Outdoors they've been

69
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:43,239
out there for at least N9 or 10 weeks

70
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:46,080
they've had big fat Sticky Buds on them

71
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:48,080
for probably four or five of those weeks

72
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,879
uh within that time frame those plants

73
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,319
have probably gathered a lot of just

74
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:54,000
natural dirt and dust every time you go

75
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:56,000
out there your feet kick up dirt and

76
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,400
dust every time the wind comes by more

77
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,639
dirt and dust you may not see it but it

78
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,000
is happening there's a little bit of

79
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:03,759
dust dust and dirt traveling every time

80
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,598
the wind comes by every time your feet

81
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:07,399
stomp every time a car drives by I don't

82
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:09,839
know where your plants are but [ __ ]

83
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,680
happens life happens nature happens dust

84
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,200
and dirt do happen those things are in

85
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:17,200
the air and your plants should hopefully

86
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:18,959
they should be sticky uh sticky plants

87
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:20,839
dust in the air you're going to get

88
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,039
Dusty dirty plants this just naturally

89
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,400
how it's going to happen it's not

90
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:26,079
because you're dirty it's not because

91
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:28,438
outside is dirty it's because wind dirt

92
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,599
dust that's how [ __ ] works so basically

93
00:03:28,438 --> 00:03:31,359
you're going to start with a little bit

94
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:33,280
of dirt and dust then there's a good

95
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,879
chance for a little bit of bird poop how

96
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,400
many times has a bird flown over your

97
00:03:34,878 --> 00:03:38,399
garden and taken a poop if you got a

98
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,039
whole bunch of yardage more opportunity

99
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,840
for more bird poop there may be a bird

100
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:43,120
turd you don't even know about so that's

101
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,640
more stuff that could end up on your

102
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,599
plants also we're going to get a lot of

103
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:49,359
bugs uh not just the uh the bugs that

104
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:50,798
you're used to on your ganja plants but

105
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,360
bugs that may have just been traveling

106
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,159
through they didn't realize that that

107
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:56,120
plant was a sticky trap they walked up

108
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:57,639
against that kush plant and got stuck

109
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:59,239
now you got a ladybug here you got a

110
00:03:57,639 --> 00:04:01,119
little Beetle over here you're going to

111
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:03,360
find stuff like that where there's bugs

112
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,400
guess what else you get bug poop there's

113
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,120
going to be bug poop on these plants so

114
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,000
what I'm saying is outdoors you may have

115
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,000
the opportunity for a lot of funky [ __ ]

116
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,519
to develop on these plants so it is

117
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,199
never a bad idea to wash these plants a

118
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,199
lot of people may be freaking out

119
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:17,478
they're thinking you're going to put the

120
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:19,879
plants in water you're going to put the

121
00:04:17,478 --> 00:04:21,719
plants in a solution and wet them yes we

122
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:24,478
are these outdoor plants have probably

123
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:26,360
been uh possibly been hit by rain and

124
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:28,359
moisture so a little bit of rinse will

125
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:30,560
not harm them will not do them any harm

126
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:32,240
if you do it correctly uh for you people

127
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,600
that say that's how you make hash yes

128
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,360
we're not going to add the ice we're not

129
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,800
going to do it as aggressively it's a

130
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,680
little bit different of a process

131
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,360
however very similar but we're not going

132
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,840
to damage the plant all right let's jump

133
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,160
right into the process there's nothing

134
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:47,279
left to do here but talk about the

135
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,000
process of how I would go about washing

136
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:50,879
some of these plants I wrote down a very

137
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,399
short very simple standard operating

138
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:54,879
procedure uh as a responsible adult as

139
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:56,519
somebody who is giving guidance and

140
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:58,800
teaching people I should start off by

141
00:04:56,519 --> 00:05:00,758
saying uh I'm going to tell you to use a

142
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,160
couple of products or one of two

143
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:05,360
products mainly when you use this

144
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:07,320
product or these products please use all

145
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,240
of the recommended personal protective

146
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:10,959
equipment if you use any of these

147
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:13,600
products and you do harm hurt damage

148
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:15,279
yourself others your plants your stuff

149
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,919
uh I am not responsible CU I'm telling

150
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:19,439
you right now read the [ __ ] label do

151
00:05:16,918 --> 00:05:23,318
it properly be safe uh I highly

152
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:25,600
recommend good n trial glove 6 Mill Mill

153
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:28,360
M 6m or thicker we're just going to say

154
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,520
6m so what it says in the package 6m or

155
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:33,000
thicker gloves I think it's Mill

156
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:34,519
uh 6 mm gloves or thicker is what we

157
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,560
would recommend in the Department of

158
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:38,758
Agriculture recommendations so you want

159
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,360
gloves for sure uh especially while

160
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:42,199
you're mixing this stuff the uh

161
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:44,479
undiluted products that I'm going to

162
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:45,919
tell you to use are very uh costic they

163
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:48,199
will damage your skin you'll get white

164
00:05:45,918 --> 00:05:49,918
burns on your skin it sucks it kind of

165
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:51,439
does hurt if it goes deep don't do that

166
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:53,839
if you get it in your eyes you're [ __ ]

167
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:55,918
so wear some goggles especially while

168
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:57,279
pouring and mixing I recommend gloves

169
00:05:55,918 --> 00:05:59,719
and goggles and if you could do a long

170
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:01,159
sleeve shirt always wear pants and shoes

171
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,280
try to be as covered as possible if you

172
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:05,680
got dreadlocks tie those up uh get them

173
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:07,318
covered up cover up any kind of hair you

174
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,959
got but you do not want this on your

175
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:10,840
skin you do not want it in your eyes it

176
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:12,478
will burn your eyes uh it will be a

177
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:14,758
problem what we're going to use we're

178
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:17,079
going to use one of two products use one

179
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:19,720
of these two do not use both it is

180
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:21,318
overkill you don't need both uh one may

181
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:23,319
be easier to find than the other

182
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:25,520
depending on your location uh depending

183
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:27,560
on how your uh how much of a hurry you

184
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:29,399
were in depending on your budget is the

185
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,959
word I'm seeking but the two products I

186
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:33,000
would recommend we would start with a

187
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:34,839
product called zero tall not the one

188
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,598
from Ed Rosenthal there's another Zero

189
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:39,159
Tolerance product from Ed Rosenthal do

190
00:06:36,598 --> 00:06:41,038
not use that we want zero tall the one

191
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:43,439
that smells like hydrogen peroxide that

192
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:45,038
is the zero tall product you want uh

193
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:47,199
that is the product I'm looking for the

194
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:51,038
other product I would recommend is the

195
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:52,639
30 or 35% hydrogen peroxide that's why I

196
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:54,279
recommend using gloves both of these

197
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,759
products are costic they will burn your

198
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:57,959
skin they will burn the [ __ ] out of your

199
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,120
eyes use gloves use goggles that's the

200
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:01,799
last time I'm going to say it be a

201
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,800
responsible grower responsible adult so

202
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:08,240
we have got either the zero tall or the

203
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:10,160
35 or 30% hydrogen peroxide the next

204
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,079
thing I recommend we need is a five

205
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,080
gallon bucket the next thing guess what

206
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:15,598
we need some water brao we're going to

207
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:17,439
fill this five gallon bucket up with

208
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:18,639
water uh leave a little bit of room

209
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:21,038
because we're going to be dunking [ __ ]

210
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,439
in here allow room for displacement uh

211
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:24,878
you may want to top it off a little bit

212
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:26,319
later as you go cuz water will spill out

213
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:28,919
and water's going to disappear into the

214
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:31,759
plants but a 5 gallon bucket is the next

215
00:07:28,918 --> 00:07:34,560
step that I recommend then I would put

216
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:36,360
depending on how dirty your product is

217
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,240
uh depending on how hard you want to go

218
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:41,879
with these products I would start with

219
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:46,079
somewhere between 25 and 50 milliliters

220
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:49,520
of the 33% hydrogen peroxide or zero

221
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:52,000
tall in a 5 gallon bucket so that's 25

222
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:53,279
to 50 milliliters in a 5 gallon bucket

223
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,839
of water you should have about 4 and a

224
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:59,000
half 4 and 3/4 of a gallon of water in

225
00:07:55,839 --> 00:08:01,198
there and 25 to 50 milliliters of this

226
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,800
product depending on how dirty you think

227
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:06,360
your crop is if you've got powdery

228
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,840
mildew uh maybe go up to the 50 ml uh if

229
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,240
you don't have any powdery Milo you

230
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:10,839
could start lower and work your way up

231
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,918
and watch the water and see what happens

232
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:15,158
it's going to be funky so we're going to

233
00:08:12,918 --> 00:08:17,198
pour in the either one of the two

234
00:08:15,158 --> 00:08:20,439
products not both you're going to put

235
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:22,400
zero tall or hydrogen peroxide at 25 to

236
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:23,879
50 milliliters while wearing gloves and

237
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:26,120
goggles I said it'd be the last time I

238
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:27,840
lied to you stir that up get that in

239
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:30,120
there get it homogeneous that's the word

240
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:32,240
right get it all stirred up properly

241
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,918
um then basically what we're going to do

242
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,120
we're going to chop the plants into

243
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:38,240
manageable pieces I like so if you cut

244
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,759
the plant properly uh think about you're

245
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,278
cutting the plant from the top if you

246
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:43,038
work your way down there's a point where

247
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:44,519
that main branch is coming up there's

248
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:47,080
another Branch coming off of the side

249
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:48,879
just a little short shoot cut below that

250
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,959
and you can use that little short shoot

251
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:53,000
as a hook to hang that plant upside down

252
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:54,919
or to hang that Branch upside down

253
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,879
repeat that process all the way down

254
00:08:54,919 --> 00:08:59,479
that's how I usually do it so I would

255
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:01,399
cut a branch off or cut a a section off

256
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:04,079
a node uh then what I would do while

257
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:06,320
wearing my gloves I would just dunk uh

258
00:09:04,078 --> 00:09:08,120
chop and then dunk that straight into

259
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,320
that hydrogen peroxide get all of the

260
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:11,440
flour part in there uh if you got buds

261
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,600
all the way up here go all the way to

262
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,800
your fingers dunk that into the hydrogen

263
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,879
peroxide solution give it a couple of

264
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:20,039
swirls don't go too crazy just a couple

265
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:22,039
of Swirls and you'll see what floats out

266
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:23,799
of it if you've got powdery Milo you

267
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:26,039
watch that powdery Milo break off and

268
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:29,240
Float out of it if there's bug [ __ ] bird

269
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:30,679
[ __ ] bug eggs bugs dirt dust debris all

270
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,120
that stuff is just going to float right

271
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:34,679
up to the top you're going to see all of

272
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:37,120
it pull that flower pull that uh branch

273
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:39,278
that flower out of there now the other

274
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,120
option some people do this some people

275
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:43,919
don't do this you can give it a rinse in

276
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,879
another bucket of just clean water a lot

277
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:48,319
of people go from that hydrogen peroxide

278
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:50,519
bucket into a Clean Water Rinse and then

279
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,839
at that point I put it on a uh I use

280
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:54,120
like a hanger like you would for a

281
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:56,519
t-shirt the same exact hangers I buy for

282
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:59,200
all my t-shirts uh I buy another bundle

283
00:09:56,519 --> 00:10:00,480
of hangers and then I hang those up so

284
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,879
the we should probably talk about

285
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,759
harvesting we'll talk about more of that

286
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:05,958
part in detail toward the end but I will

287
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:07,720
use that coat hanger and I'll put two or

288
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:09,719
three of these wet branches on there and

289
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:11,440
hang those on a line or something which

290
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,759
we're going to talk about in the future

291
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,839
so dunk it give it a good swirl and hang

292
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:18,319
it um it's really not that much of a

293
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:20,600
challenge I've got my notes are um 5

294
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:24,120
gallon bucket 30 to 50 milliliters

295
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:26,360
gloves and goggles uh chop dunk swish

296
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:28,799
hang and then it says optional second

297
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:30,680
rinse and that's basically how you do a

298
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:32,240
bud wash it's really not that difficult

299
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:33,838
it's just like it would sound you're

300
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,759
going to take these fresh buds they're

301
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,360
fresh buds do this when the plant is wet

302
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:40,000
I've got to stress that right now right

303
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:42,919
do this while the plant is fresh and wet

304
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
you want this like literally chop dunk

305
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:47,039
if you can do chop dunk like in that

306
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,839
quick of a process maybe chop the whole

307
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:51,159
plant move it to the area chop it into

308
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:52,920
manageable pieces uh like remember that

309
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:54,439
little part I said we're using the one

310
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:57,120
the hook is your your little hanger

311
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:59,360
piece so chop mindfully with hooks and

312
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,159
then chop them dunk them swish them

313
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,440
around hang them up and then get them to

314
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:05,000
your dry and cure area now let's focus a

315
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:08,120
little bit on the area where we are

316
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,720
going to hang these plants um these

317
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:11,799
plants are going to be dripping water

318
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:14,079
you just dunk them into a bucket of

319
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:15,559
water and possibly into another bucket

320
00:11:14,078 --> 00:11:17,638
of water if you're choosing to do the

321
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:19,359
second bucket um they're going to be

322
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:20,480
dripping water I recommend doing this

323
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,440
somewhere where you can just get the

324
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,480
floor completely soaked and not have too

325
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,680
much of an issue stressing over it or

326
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,320
you're going to have to mop up that

327
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:30,159
water frequently or manage that water uh

328
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,519
in one of the facil where I did this we

329
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:34,159
had a fully concrete floor so it wasn't

330
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:35,879
too big of a deal that water dripped out

331
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:38,278
into the concrete floor it made a little

332
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:40,000
mess right under the plants put a fan on

333
00:11:38,278 --> 00:11:42,000
there it dried up quite quickly wasn't

334
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,399
too big of a deal and another place we

335
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,278
did it we did it Outdoors it just

336
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:47,159
dripped onto the ground not too big of a

337
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:48,919
deal but keep in mind there will be

338
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:50,360
water dripping out of these plants not a

339
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:52,240
whole lot of water depending on the size

340
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:55,519
of your plants the size of your buds but

341
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:57,919
there will be water dripping out so um

342
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,600
think about having a way to move that

343
00:11:57,919 --> 00:12:01,240
water you want some air flow in there

344
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,000
and you want some water to be removed

345
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,480
from these plants and from the room not

346
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,839
rapidly you want this to happen at a

347
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,839
natural slow pace but you may want a few

348
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:10,600
fans in that room to move that air

349
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:12,880
around you don't want any stagnant water

350
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,639
sitting anywhere so don't have don't

351
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:17,120
have a fan just blowing on the plant

352
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:19,480
just the whole time that's going to piss

353
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,399
things off have it passing occasionally

354
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:23,199
and just have it moving and mixing don't

355
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:25,519
have all your fans moving together in

356
00:12:23,198 --> 00:12:27,039
sink have the air mixing and moving and

357
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,799
try to have some sort of extraction

358
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:31,919
moving that air out of that areir that

359
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:33,198
water out of that area where those

360
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:34,759
plants are let me get back to my notes

361
00:12:33,198 --> 00:12:36,599
and get myself back on track I'm high as

362
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:38,799
[ __ ] in Rambling shout out to my friends

363
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,920
at green. Labs I took a dab of lemon

364
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:42,958
butter rum and it's got me going a

365
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:45,240
million miles an hour big fist bump to

366
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:46,838
the crew uh where were we hang them dry

367
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:49,120
put a fan on there but not direct the

368
00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:51,320
Florida is going to get wet you may need

369
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,198
a uh dehumidifier depending on the size

370
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,879
of your room the amount of plants a

371
00:12:53,198 --> 00:12:57,519
dehumidifier will help you out

372
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:58,759
drastically uh try to keep the room just

373
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:02,039
like when you're drying and curing

374
00:12:58,759 --> 00:13:04,759
around 50 to 60% relative humidity and

375
00:13:02,039 --> 00:13:06,838
also about 60° if you possibly can do

376
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:09,240
that a lot of people argue about

377
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:11,399
parameters I'm not super picky it's

378
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:14,120
going to work you will have good product

379
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:17,078
I like that 50 to 60% uh relative

380
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:19,198
humidity range uh that works for me uh

381
00:13:17,078 --> 00:13:21,679
people say 50 people say 60 if I give

382
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:23,838
you a range nobody can argue all right

383
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:25,278
let me stay on track here uh the Florida

384
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,040
is going to be wet get lots of air

385
00:13:25,278 --> 00:13:29,120
exchange if you can move the air in and

386
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:30,639
out of that room like get that humid a

387
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,278
air out and fresh air in that room that

388
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,839
will help you uh we just don't want

389
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:36,278
these wet buds to get stale funky uh

390
00:13:34,839 --> 00:13:38,160
that's when you'll start to get problems

391
00:13:36,278 --> 00:13:40,399
we need air flow we need fresh air in

392
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:42,559
there uh we don't want any stagnant air

393
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:44,600
at this time because we've got wet soggy

394
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:46,719
buds we just purposely dunked these buds

395
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:49,720
they are super wet keep the air moving I

396
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,920
can't stress that enough um gentle fans

397
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:54,160
and lots of air exchange is underlined

398
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:55,519
twice on this page so uh make sure you

399
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:57,439
got fans in there I'm going to say it

400
00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:00,078
again moving the air around mixing and

401
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,680
moving that air uh not blowing directly

402
00:14:00,078 --> 00:14:03,120
on the plants cuz that will piss them

403
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:05,399
off even if they're just drying they'll

404
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,000
dry too quickly we still want to slow

405
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:09,320
dry them we just want to get this water

406
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,360
out and then actually restart the

407
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:13,320
regular dry and cure process once this

408
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,839
water is gone it may depending on the

409
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:17,399
size of your plants it could take four

410
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:18,880
hours it could take 24 hours uh to get

411
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:20,958
back to where you started before you

412
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:22,480
dunked them honestly depends on the room

413
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:25,958
and the size of the plants the density

414
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:28,000
of the buds lots of factors there um so

415
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:30,359
um get a lot of air flow in there air

416
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,958
exchange a dehumid fire may be an option

417
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,600
at this time you may need some ducting

418
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:35,518
to suck the air out of that room I don't

419
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,278
know your setup but I want you to be

420
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,679
prepared for this before we even get

421
00:14:37,278 --> 00:14:41,159
there be mindful when you are hanging

422
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:43,479
these plants I talked about putting them

423
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:45,240
on a hanger and hanging them up be

424
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,560
mindful when you are hanging up these

425
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:48,360
plants you don't want them touching you

426
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:49,879
don't want them pressed together have a

427
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:52,120
couple of inches at least be able to put

428
00:14:49,879 --> 00:14:53,958
your hands between every plant between

429
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:55,720
every Branch that's hanging so that we

430
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:57,239
do not get any water trapped in there if

431
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:59,360
you can go in there and move them around

432
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,720
you'll notice that uh no matter how much

433
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,879
air flow you put in that room you're

434
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,720
going to have microclimates some of the

435
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:07,000
buds over here are going to dry more

436
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,680
quickly than some of the buds over here

437
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,679
switch them why not just swap them

438
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:11,958
places don't be shy don't be afraid to

439
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:13,958
go in there and move [ __ ] around that

440
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:15,919
could be a very good idea the stuff

441
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:17,518
that's been right by the fan for 3 hours

442
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:19,159
Put it way over here and put some new

443
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:21,480
[ __ ] that hasn't been near the fan by

444
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:23,159
the fan just adjust and keep those give

445
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:25,159
them a lot of love care and attention is

446
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:26,480
basically what I'm trying to say uh so

447
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:29,399
be mindful when you're hanging those

448
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:31,120
plants be prepared before before you

449
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:32,559
start chopping these plants that's

450
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,240
something that I should have talked

451
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:36,399
about in the beginning before you even

452
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,720
cut down before you think about cutting

453
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:39,639
down the plants before you put on your

454
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:41,160
gloves and get your big cutting shears

455
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:45,278
or whatever your chainsaw whatever

456
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:48,318
you're using um be prepared 100% for

457
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:51,720
this process have your buckets have your

458
00:15:48,318 --> 00:15:53,879
water have your peroxide or your zerotol

459
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:56,759
have your gloves have your goggles have

460
00:15:53,879 --> 00:15:58,318
a table and some space uh keep in mind

461
00:15:56,759 --> 00:16:00,879
this is going to be a process you're not

462
00:15:58,318 --> 00:16:02,679
just try that give yourself a clean safe

463
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:04,240
sanitary workspace that you're proud of

464
00:16:02,679 --> 00:16:05,919
that you're going to be comfortable in

465
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,480
depending on how many plants you may be

466
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:09,759
at this for a while make it something

467
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:11,480
you're proud of the more you prepare the

468
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:13,000
more you will have success I know that

469
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:15,120
sounds like some [ __ ] that Dad would say

470
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,480
but guess what I'm a dad and I'm [ __ ]

471
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,120
right dude the more you prepare the more

472
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,879
the better chance you have for a success

473
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,799
and also the more chance you have to

474
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:24,439
enjoy it if you just clean up the space

475
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:26,879
around you get the things you need on

476
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:28,360
the table have everything you need uh

477
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:30,198
before you start doing it when it comes

478
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,759
time to do it but it's so smooth that

479

00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:43,680
everything you need before you even

485
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:45,360
start chopping the plants and having

486
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:46,879
everything you need also includes having

487
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,879
the room ready I've got some notes here

488
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:52,000
that I did Overlook uh air flow

489
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:53,399
temperature humidity and security when

490
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,120
these plants are going somewhere you

491
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:56,679
need to have air flow in that room you

492
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,480
need to get the temperature and humidity

493
00:16:56,679 --> 00:17:00,638
right I talked about those things but I

494
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,120
did not talk about security where are

495
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,318
you going to put this Harvest where is

496
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:05,759
it going where is this Harvest going to

497
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:07,519
go once you chop it down it's been

498
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:09,720
growing for a while outside everybody

499
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:11,359
knew you had it when you cut it down if

500
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,720
anybody was looking they'll know those

501
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:15,279
plants are gone and they'll know they

502
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,798
are hanging somewhere too dry there may

503
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:18,359
be somebody out there looking for those

504
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:20,318
plants I don't mean to make you paranoid

505
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:22,078
but I want to make you aware that people

506
00:17:20,318 --> 00:17:24,119
were looking there were probably a

507
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:25,838
couple of people somebody you know knows

508
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:27,479
that these plants just got harvested one

509
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:29,159
of your neighbors has been looking over

510
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:31,000
the fence every day and they saw those

511
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,798
plants now they're gone they're going to

512
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,519
go oh I wonder where they are that's

513
00:17:32,798 --> 00:17:35,759
just how people think uh that's how

514
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:37,319
people in my neighborhood think

515
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:39,200
unfortunately that's the [ __ ] I've got

516
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:41,279
to prepare for so I'm going to tell you

517
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,798
to think about security and safety of

518
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:44,480
these plants where are they going to go

519
00:17:42,798 --> 00:17:46,200
when you cut them down do you have a

520
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,720
locked area where you can put them a

521
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,200
garage a safe and think double think

522
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,839
about your security think about

523
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:54,160
everybody you know if you've got cameras

524
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:56,240
now it's the time to adjust them uh put

525
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,720
them focused on where these plants are

526
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,839
all right that's security is a huge

527
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,200
issue right now that's what I'm talking

528
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:02,639
talking about now let's talk about

529
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:04,440
having all of the [ __ ] that we need uh

530
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,600
before we even start chopping down these

531
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:09,720
plants I want you to be prepared this is

532
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:11,480
going to not just be around the chopping

533
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,919
of the plants initially this is going to

534
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:16,200
lead us into the full Harvest process

535
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:18,559
and also leading up to the trim process

536
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:20,679
I like to uh I prefer a dry trim I let

537
00:18:18,558 --> 00:18:22,240
the plants dry before I trim them but

538
00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:25,280
the time between chopping them down and

539
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,960
trimming them uh could be 7 10 14 days

540
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:29,079
depending on your location your

541
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,840
environment uh a lot of things will into

542
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:33,158
play here so start thinking about that

543
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:35,839
now before we cut down these plants be

544
00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:38,039
ready all the way to chop them down dunk

545
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:40,359
them hang them keep them preserved to

546
00:18:38,038 --> 00:18:42,000
where they dry and cure slowly then be

547
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:43,678
ready to trim them that is the thought

548
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,640
process I want you to have now it's all

549
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:48,360
one week long work process maybe a two

550
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,080
long maybe even longer for some of you

551
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:52,158
folks out there some of you guys will be

552
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:54,319
cutting down till New Year's but be

553
00:18:52,159 --> 00:18:55,960
prepared now so that [ __ ] goes correctly

554
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:57,519
I think I gave this same speech last

555
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:59,240
year now that I'm talking about it I

556
00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:00,519
think I gave this exact talk last year

557
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:02,200
now that I'm thinking about it make sure

558
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:04,200
you check that episode for the things

559
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:06,798
that I missed on this episode combine

560
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:08,519
them you'll have the turbo Harvest prep

561
00:19:06,798 --> 00:19:09,839
episode all right where were we things

562
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:12,000
we're going to need for this Harvest

563
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:14,240
I've mentioned them before gloves uh I

564
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,319
like to buy a fresh pack of gloves the

565
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,200
box of gloves right before Harvest Time

566
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:19,359
in multiple sizes who's coming over to

567
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,360
help you are you going to have friends

568
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:23,000

569
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:24,839
crop is your girlfriend helping you is

570
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,038
your best friend helping you uh is

571
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:29,599
another grow partner helping you do you

572
00:19:27,038 --> 00:19:31,519
all wear the same size gloves unlikely I

573
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:33,399
would say order find out who's coming

574
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:35,400
over what size gloves they wear and

575
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:37,000
order them or go buy them as soon as

576
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,759
possible so you've got them before the

577
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,240
Harvest starts we're going to need

578
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:43,319
gloves we're going to need scissors um

579
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:45,720
scissors for each person to trim and

580
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:47,519
also bigger scissors to cut the plant

581
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:49,720
down do you have some sort of shears

582
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:52,038
some sort of Chopper a chainsaw a

583
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:53,839
handsaw anything we need something to

584
00:19:52,038 --> 00:19:55,960
cut that plant down with start thinking

585
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:57,519
about that now the bigger the plant the

586
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:59,120
more cutting power you're going to need

587
00:19:57,519 --> 00:20:01,119
don't [ __ ] your hand up by buying the

588
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:04,038
wrong tool buy the right tool it will

589
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:05,678
cut smoothly if you do it correctly um

590
00:20:04,038 --> 00:20:06,919
some sort of hangers what are so we're

591
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:08,759
going to cut down the Plant we're going

592
00:20:06,919 --> 00:20:10,240
to cut it into smaller pieces we're

593
00:20:08,759 --> 00:20:11,400
going to dunk it we're going to swish it

594
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,960
we're going to rinse it we're going to

595
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:16,280
hang it up in my uh system it goes onto

596
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:18,960
a coat hanger and that coat hanger hangs

597
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:20,480
on a line that goes across a full room

598
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,720
there's an ey hook on that side of the

599
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,440
room an IH hook on that side of the room

600
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,279
and a piece of fishing line goes across

601
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:28,360
the room and then I hang all of the

602
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:30,359
hangers on that fishing line make sure

603
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:31,798
you know how to tie a real good knot so

604
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:33,439
that [ __ ] doesn't fall in the middle of

605
00:20:31,798 --> 00:20:36,519
the night and freak you out and piss you

606
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:38,240
off wet weed hitting the dirty floor if

607
00:20:36,519 --> 00:20:40,038
that that is frustrating especially

608
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,359
after you've already dunked it so hang

609
00:20:40,038 --> 00:20:44,038
that [ __ ] up properly one fishee here

610
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:46,798
one fishee here you got a cable a

611
00:20:44,038 --> 00:20:48,440
fishing line a good twine going across

612
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:50,558
then I put two or three little branches

613
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:52,720
on each coat hanger I hang those coat

614
00:20:50,558 --> 00:20:54,240
hangers up on that fishing line so

615
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,480
whatever you need to get that line

616
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,079
system going uh you can do a vertical

617
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,720
rack if you want to use chicken wire and

618
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:01,879
put coat hangers or just branches of

619
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:03,279
weed on the chicken wire spread them out

620
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:05,640
properly there are a lot of ways to do

621
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:07,720
it but start thinking about that now

622
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:10,278
before we cut down the plants so we got

623
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:12,319
gloves scissors hangers a line or a rack

624
00:21:10,278 --> 00:21:14,558
to hang that [ __ ] on now we're going to

625
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:16,038
get into the small details some rubbing

626
00:21:14,558 --> 00:21:17,879
alcohol to clean all of your scissors

627
00:21:16,038 --> 00:21:19,839
and all your [ __ ] because uh

628
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:22,278
everything's going to get sticky during

629
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:24,079
Harvest Time also all the hippies use

630
00:21:22,278 --> 00:21:26,079
coconut oil if you get your fingers all

631
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:27,839
sticky uh you need to get this the

632
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:30,240
sticky off your fingers out of your arm

633
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:32,720
hair coconut oil Works beautifully go

634
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,159
buy a fresh jar of coconut oil uh dish

635
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,839
some of it out for each person I think

636
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:38,240
it's tacky as [ __ ] stick in everybody's

637
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:40,000
hand in the same coconut oil jar uh but

638
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,440
dish some out maybe uh bring your own

639
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,720
coconut oil but that will clean your

640
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,880
hands real good get the sticky off there

641
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:47,519
it also works to clean your scissors put

642
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:49,480
a little coconut oil in a dish set the

643
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:51,480
scissors in there rub them massage it

644
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:54,120
off that uh the sticky will come right

645
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:55,960
off um what else do we need some snacks

646
00:21:54,119 --> 00:21:57,959
bro trimming and harvesting people

647
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:00,440
forget about eating and how long it's

648
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:02,480
going to be get a cooler put some ice in

649
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:03,880
that cooler put some good [ __ ] drinks

650
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,360
in there ask everybody that's coming

651
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:08,360
over what do you like to drink uh folks

652
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:12,199
know that I like coconut water Fiji

653
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:13,599
Water and a good lime flavored hitos um

654
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,000
get the drinks that your friends like

655
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:16,599
it's not that hard to stop by the store

656
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,640
and pick up a few drinks especially if

657
00:22:16,599 --> 00:22:20,119
they're coming over to help you trim and

658
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,960
harvest your weed they'll be there for

659
00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:23,759
hours you're going to be smoking and

660
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:25,440
laughing it's going to be worth the the

661
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:28,119
whatever it cost to go get a couple of

662
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:30,360
sodas a couple of juices um I prefer not

663
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:31,879
to have alcohol at the trim party but if

664
00:22:30,359 --> 00:22:34,038
you've got responsible friends who may

665
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:35,600
want a glass of wine or one beer that's

666
00:22:34,038 --> 00:22:37,480
your place you're all adults do what you

667
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:39,240
want to do but go grab a couple of

668
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:41,240
drinks for the people I like a hitos

669
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,558
Mike would be just happy with a hitos

670
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,919
going and grabbing the drinks that your

671
00:22:42,558 --> 00:22:45,440
friends and your trim crew want just

672
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:46,759
shows that you want them to be there and

673
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,919
you want them comfortable and they will

674
00:22:46,759 --> 00:22:50,960
trim longer and they will be happier so

675
00:22:48,919 --> 00:22:52,559
go get them some snacks and drinks also

676
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,720
tip your trim crew at the end of the day

677
00:22:52,558 --> 00:22:54,960
I don't know what you're paying them I

678
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:57,400
don't know what kind of deal you've got

679
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:59,000
worked out but a little tip of some sort

680
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:01,480
always makes people happy they'll come

681
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,038
back tomorrow trim harder trim better uh

682
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,640
and they'll remember you and everybody

683
00:23:03,038 --> 00:23:06,119
likes a little bit of a tip like that

684
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,278
that's just how I do it you don't have

685
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:10,079
to do it that way but all the trim crew

686
00:23:08,278 --> 00:23:11,759
was going yeah bro [ __ ] tip me out I

687
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:13,918
worked hard I did I didn't steal I did a

688
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:16,519
good job I had to listen to your music

689
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:18,038
all day tip me the [ __ ] out all right so

690
00:23:16,519 --> 00:23:20,319
um something I wrote down here I talked

691
00:23:18,038 --> 00:23:22,519
about this last year don't rub your eyes

692
00:23:20,319 --> 00:23:24,639
bro do not rub your eyes when you're

693
00:23:22,519 --> 00:23:26,639
trimming if your eye itches if your nose

694
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,880
itches don't touch it uh because as soon

695
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,720
as you touch your eyeball when you've

696
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:31,440
been trimming it is going to feel like

697
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:33,000
fire tricomes in your eyes are one of

698
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,640
the worst things ever I've actually I

699
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,359
remember doing a video about this last

700
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,320
year uh guys when you're trimming when

701
00:23:36,359 --> 00:23:40,000
you're harvesting don't touch your eyes

702
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:41,759
all that sticky [ __ ] ends up in your eye

703
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,240
and it is the worst feeling you will

704
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:44,640
ever endure we're going to move on from

705
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:46,519
that cuz I remember saying this last

706
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,759
year also when we're setting up for

707
00:23:46,519 --> 00:23:49,918
Harvest and trimming if you've got

708
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:52,158
people coming over for a while uh be

709
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:54,759
mindful and courteous of the podcasts

710
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:56,640
and or music that you play I get it it's

711
00:23:54,759 --> 00:23:58,480
my house it's my music but if you're

712
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,640
into something extreme like I like fish

713
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,919
fish I know that Fish the band fish is

714
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,320
not everybody's cup of uh cup of tea I

715
00:24:02,919 --> 00:24:05,919
was going to try something smartass to

716
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:08,278
say but it's not everybody's cup of tea

717
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:10,080
and I get that I may play some fish but

718
00:24:08,278 --> 00:24:12,038
not enough to make you want to punch

719
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:13,639
yourself in the face some people uh it's

720
00:24:12,038 --> 00:24:15,359
only one or two songs so they do want to

721
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:17,120
punch themselves in the face for fish I

722
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:19,278
get that so I'll throw down one good

723
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:20,639
song and we heard fish and we'll move on

724
00:24:19,278 --> 00:24:21,720
but think about who's coming over I'm

725
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,640
not telling you what to do with your

726
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:25,440
place but the trimmers will trim better

727
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,679
if they're happier they'll stick around

728
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,960
longer if they're happier and they'll

729
00:24:26,679 --> 00:24:30,159
come back to trim more if they're

730
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:31,919
happier uh if you play [ __ ] Cannibal

731
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:33,880
Corpse all day for the wrong crowd

732
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:35,559
they're not coming back of course if

733
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:37,120
Joe's coming over play Cannibal Corpse

734
00:24:35,558 --> 00:24:38,678
all day I got a friend Nam Joe shout out

735
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:41,359

736
00:24:38,679 --> 00:24:43,159

737
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:44,798
the same [ __ ] like that all day long so

738
00:24:43,159 --> 00:24:46,760
mix it up find out what people like be

739
00:24:44,798 --> 00:24:48,319

740
00:24:46,759 --> 00:24:49,679
listen to Joe Rogan all day not

741
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:51,918
everybody wants to listen to Legion of

742
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:53,679
skanks all day try to be mindful all I'm

743
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:56,038
saying guys is if you want the trim crew

744
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:58,399
to come back give them what they like uh

745
00:24:56,038 --> 00:24:59,798
don't run them off don't scare them away

746
00:24:58,398 --> 00:25:01,239
show them that you care about them and

747
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:03,519
that they're invited and that you like

748
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:05,960
them uh what else do we got for you

749
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:07,720
comfortable chairs dude um a good

750
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:10,319
comfortable chair at the right height

751
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:12,278
will make a trimmer uh trim much longer

752
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:14,359
or take a lot more smoke breaks if

753
00:25:12,278 --> 00:25:16,278
you're set up too low and you're hunched

754
00:25:14,359 --> 00:25:17,798
and you're [ __ ] struggling all day

755
00:25:16,278 --> 00:25:19,398
all of your back is going to hurt those

756
00:25:17,798 --> 00:25:21,000
trimmers are going to need more snack

757
00:25:19,398 --> 00:25:22,359
breaks uh they're going to take more

758
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,119
phone breaks they're going to take more

759
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:25,479
cigarette breakes just to get out of

760
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:27,278
that damn chair and stretch around

761
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:29,000
you'll see them walking around your grow

762
00:25:27,278 --> 00:25:30,480
you'll see them wandering out outside

763
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,880
they'll just be doing other [ __ ] than

764
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,679
trimming because the chairs suck so try

765
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,640
to have good comfortable chairs and good

766
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:38,600
comfortable seating also a table at a

767
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:41,120
reasonable height that matches those

768
00:25:38,599 --> 00:25:43,599
[ __ ] chairs also trim bins if you can

769
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:45,519
get some kind of trim tray or trim bin

770
00:25:43,599 --> 00:25:47,079
that a trimmer can set directly in their

771
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:49,319
lap and be comfortable with and trim

772
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:51,240
right on their own lap it's ergonomical

773
00:25:49,319 --> 00:25:53,000
if you buy the good trim bins uh

774
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:54,720
ergonomical that's the right word yeah

775
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,599
it's good for their body they can sit

776
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,640
with proper posture and they can get the

777
00:25:56,599 --> 00:26:00,199
trim bin on their arms or on the table

778
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,679
and they can trim how they need it and

779
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,440
not have to do weird [ __ ] with their

780
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:04,640
neck and back and shoulders and arms I

781
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,480
know it just seems like they're sitting

782
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,480
there all day uh listening to music

783
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,200
eating snacks but guys it is taxing on

784
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,839
your body to trim for more than two or

785
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:14,120
three or 4 hours it starts to hurt it

786
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:16,240
starts to suck you need the proper gear

787
00:26:14,119 --> 00:26:20,079
the proper setup speaking of proper gear

788
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:21,679
and proper setup how about good lighting

789
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:24,240
we need some good bright lighting but

790
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:26,038
also not overwhelming lighting uh the

791
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:28,558
right color of lighting the bright white

792
00:26:26,038 --> 00:26:30,359
lighting really helps for trimming uh if

793
00:26:28,558 --> 00:26:32,599
you can get the lights closer to the

794
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:34,519
trim area that's even better uh some

795
00:26:32,599 --> 00:26:35,959
places offer a little movable lights for

796
00:26:34,519 --> 00:26:38,119
some of the trimmers I've seen places

797
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:39,640
offer the lights with the magnifying

798
00:26:38,119 --> 00:26:41,079
glass in it so you can get a big View

799
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:43,200
and you can so if you're older if you're

800
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:44,720
going blind uh you can trim from far

801
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,679
away shout out to my buddy gay blind

802
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,759

right where were we we're talking about

806
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:57,080
Good lighting good gear basically think

807
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,520
about all of this uh before you start

808
00:26:57,079 --> 00:27:00,000
cutting down the Plant I don't want to

809
00:26:58,519 --> 00:27:01,599
see you in a situation where you just

810
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,319
chop down a plant you've got it sitting

811
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:05,319
on a table or hanging up somewhere

812
00:27:03,319 --> 00:27:06,720
precariously while you've got to run to

813
00:27:05,319 --> 00:27:08,519
the hardware store and run to the

814
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,038
grocery store and go get a couple of

815
00:27:08,519 --> 00:27:11,440
snacks and a couple of five gallon

816
00:27:10,038 --> 00:27:13,440
buckets and some whatever else you

817
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,919
forgot I'd rather you just be super

818
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,120
prepared now so I'm trying to give you a

819
00:27:14,919 --> 00:27:18,960
heads up in a list of the things uh that

820
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:21,519
I use and that you may use when it comes

821
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:23,319
to harvest time so get your space ready

822
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:25,240
have a space ready not only to chop down

823
00:27:23,319 --> 00:27:26,918
and do the work but a space to hang all

824
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:28,960
of that Harvest however much Harvest

825
00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:30,600
you've got it's going to take about

826
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,440
probably I don't know how well you did

827
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:33,959
but think at least half of that space

828
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:35,640
where you're growing you're going to

829
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:37,840
need that much space to hang this and

830
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:39,919
let it dry so start prepping for your

831
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:41,278
space uh start prepping your space where

832
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:42,919
you're going to do the work and where

833
00:27:41,278 --> 00:27:45,038
you're going to do the hang and where

834
00:27:42,919 --> 00:27:46,880
you're going to do the trim then also

835
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:48,640
the dry and cure do you have jars do you

836
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,440
have something to dry and cure this in

837
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,919
we did not even get that far in my

838
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:54,240
little talk here I got us up to trimming

839
00:27:52,919 --> 00:27:56,679
um that's as far as I got you're going

840
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,399
to need bins to collect the uh trimmed

841
00:27:56,679 --> 00:28:00,798
flowers in you're going to need bins for

842
00:27:58,398 --> 00:28:02,678
the trim you're going to need trash bags

843
00:28:00,798 --> 00:28:04,200
for all the waste there are a lot of

844
00:28:02,679 --> 00:28:06,159
things to think about if we want to go

845
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:08,798
all the way up to uh right to the point

846
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:10,600
of dry and cure you're definitely going

847
00:28:08,798 --> 00:28:12,038
to need more scissors you're going to

848
00:28:10,599 --> 00:28:13,959
need to clean those scissors scissors

849
00:28:12,038 --> 00:28:15,679
for each person I like to have two pairs

850
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:17,440
of scissors per person so when one gets

851
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:19,200
too sticky drop the other one in the

852
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,919
alcohol or the coconut oil use the other

853
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,679
pair for a while let that other pair

854
00:28:20,919 --> 00:28:24,960
soak anyway I'm getting nonsensical now

855
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:26,278
talking about all the small details but

856
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,679
as time goes on you're going to need

857
00:28:26,278 --> 00:28:29,038
trash bags you're going to need trim

858
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:30,278
trays you're going to need containers

859
00:28:29,038 --> 00:28:32,200
for all of the buds that have been

860
00:28:30,278 --> 00:28:33,640
trimmed so you got trim crew there

861
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:35,360
they're chopping [ __ ] up they're going

862
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:36,440
to have waste that's got to go somewhere

863
00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:37,798
what are you going to do with all the

864
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:39,558
waste have you thought about this if

865
00:28:37,798 --> 00:28:40,918
you've got a big Harvest you're going to

866
00:28:39,558 --> 00:28:42,398
have a bunch of sticks are you going to

867
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:44,679
be comfortable putting all those sticks

868
00:28:42,398 --> 00:28:46,119
in the outdoor trash do you have a fire

869
00:28:44,679 --> 00:28:47,960
pit that maybe you could burn those in

870
00:28:46,119 --> 00:28:49,479
out in the backyard have a little party

871
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:51,200
just randomly throw some of those sticks

872
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:52,440
in there get rid of them that way going

873
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,960
to have a lot of waste you're going to

874
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,960
have trim what are you going to do with

875
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,240
all the trim are you going to make

876
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,480
edibles do you know somebody that can

877
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:00,159
make concentrates um maybe some of the

878
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,440
trimmers want some of the trim as a tip

879
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:03,240
they might want to go make their own

880
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,759
Edibles or something with it do you have

881
