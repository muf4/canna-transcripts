the free seeds I do want to apologize

25
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,159
I've had to make an adjustment on I

26
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:17,040
redirect we can no longer ship to Canada

27
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,740
the Canadian border patrol has sent me a

28
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,240
letter saying please stop then they sent

29
00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:23,579
me another letter saying no really

30
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:25,199
please [ __ ] stop I don't want that

31
00:01:23,579 --> 00:01:27,359
third letter so at this point I have

32
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,219
stopped sending orders to Canada I

33
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:31,019

36
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:37,978

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,959
Canada maybe they'll make it maybe they

38
00:01:37,978 --> 00:01:41,519

t-shirt or something up there in Canada

41
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:47,340
again I apologize it's not my decision

42
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:49,320
it wasn't my move this is the decision

43
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:51,000
of the Canadian border patrol

44
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:52,859
and I don't want to mess with the

45
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,078
Canadian border patrol any more than I

46
00:01:52,859 --> 00:01:56,219
already have so I apologize no seeds are

47
00:01:55,078 --> 00:01:58,500

63
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:27,420

Mike back on the podcast in the future

67
00:02:31,378 --> 00:02:35,399
because I've got a uh a setup idea a

68
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:37,319
little production idea that'll be a

69
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,939
little bit different I was cool with the

70
00:02:37,318 --> 00:02:40,619
way we did it side by side but it kind

71
00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:42,239
of looked like uh the Cannabis version

72
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:44,159
of are you garbage if you get that joke

73
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,200
you're [ __ ] awesome but I was hard to

74
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:47,878
edit that one a little bit symmetry

75
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:49,018
problems there I found a new way in my

76
00:02:47,878 --> 00:02:51,299
head that I think will work better look

77
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:53,340
better on camera so Mike I can't wait to

78

00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,819
the setup a little bit and I have a good

80
00:02:55,378 --> 00:02:58,199
idea to make us both look sharp on

81
00:02:56,818 --> 00:02:59,939
camera it's going to be great so Mike

82

00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,978
answer part today I'm answering a

166
00:05:51,478 --> 00:05:55,560
question that came from the grow help

167
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:58,379
tap on the irie genetics website if you

168
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,879
go to my website irygenetics.com there

169
00:05:58,379 --> 00:06:01,259
are a bunch of tabs on the top one of

170
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:03,300
them does say grow help or grow

171
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:05,520
questions click on there that will take

172
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:07,020
you to a little questionnaire we ask a

173
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:08,639
few questions about your grow and then

174
00:06:07,019 --> 00:06:10,560
we give you the opportunity to type in

175
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,780
your main concern main question about

176
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,000
your grow this one came from our friend

177
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:17,159
Gabe on the grow from your arm the irie

178
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,319
genetics website grow help tab the

179
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:21,060
question goes roster Jeff thank you for

180
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:23,099
reading my question and I hope you and

181
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:25,560
the fam are having an amazing year bro

182
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,879
everything is irie so far thanks for the

183
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,680
well wishes I hope you and your family

184
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:30,959
and your garden are killing it as well

185
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,579
it says I've been watching a lot of the

186
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:34,859
podcast with other breeders like

187
00:06:32,579 --> 00:06:38,519
yourself one topic that has caught my

188
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:40,319
eye was breeding out the Herm Gene then

189
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:42,599
he said I have a strain that was fire

190
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,340
but had a super high Herm rate an

191
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,860
intersex rate is the word I prefer to

192
00:06:44,339 --> 00:06:48,478
use what would be the best way to breed

193
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:51,000
this out would it be worth reversing

194
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:53,219
stable female who knows if that Gene is

195
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,579
recessive P.S if you do read this on the

196
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:57,960
podcast my friends call me Panda big

197
00:06:56,579 --> 00:07:00,538
shout out to my buddy Panda what's up

198
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:02,939
bro thank you for the great question

199
00:07:00,538 --> 00:07:04,079
um as a breeder so I've got a couple of

200
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:05,399
different answers on a couple of

201
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:08,698
different levels you have to keep in

202
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:10,739
mind I make seeds for a somewhat

203
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:13,319
commercial level I'm selling seeds to

204
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:16,439
people on the internet I need my seeds

205
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:18,479
to be top-notch reliable uh not have any

206
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:21,719
intersex traits hidden in those seeds in

207
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:23,579
any Generations in any form because uh

208
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,680
my customers my clients my friends the

209
00:07:23,579 --> 00:07:28,500
ivory Army do not deserve intersex

210
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,180
plants it's my job to weed that out so

211
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,519
if this were me

212
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:34,860
this strain that is fire but shows

213
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:36,359
intersex traits would disappear I would

214
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:38,699
cut that [ __ ] down I would get rid of

215
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:40,979
it it would not last in my garden with

216
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:42,960
all of the seeds all of the strains all

217
00:07:40,978 --> 00:07:44,159
of the Clones all of the options why

218
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:46,500
would you pick a plant that's got

219
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,780
intersex traits to breed with set

220
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:51,180
yourself up for success is my opinion

221
00:07:48,779 --> 00:07:54,418
that's my situation in my breeding

222
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:56,699
company in my grow uh in my rules but

223
00:07:54,418 --> 00:07:58,680
you may not be selling seeds you might

224
00:07:56,699 --> 00:08:00,538
just be making seeds for yourself these

225
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:02,699
seeds aren't going to go anywhere if

226
00:08:00,538 --> 00:08:04,439
you're making seeds for yourself it may

227
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:07,020
be worth breeding out that intersex

228
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:08,519
trait and but on somebody who's putting

229
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:10,740
seeds out to other people I don't want

230
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:12,839
to do that but you could breed it out

231
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:14,098
you could find another plant so you've

232
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:15,839
got the female that you know makes

233
00:08:14,098 --> 00:08:18,120
intersex trades I would grow until you

234
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:19,258
find one that does not make the intersex

235
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,478
if you can find out if you've got

236
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:22,979
several seeds if you can find one test

237
00:08:21,478 --> 00:08:25,199
it if you finally get one that doesn't

238
00:08:22,978 --> 00:08:26,519
make intersex trades I would pollinate

239
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,860
it with a different male and then start

240
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:31,198
working on the bat cross make sure every

241
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:32,459
generation is test tested thoroughly to

242
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,560
make sure it does not have that

243
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:36,598
intersect straight hidden in there you

244
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:39,119
could also reverse it if you find a

245
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:41,459
phenotype that you really like but like

246
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,379
I said a moment ago this is like

247
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:45,000
um this girl is really pretty she's

248
00:08:43,379 --> 00:08:46,799
pretty nice to you but on the weekends

249
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,778
she stabs you with the butter knife in

250
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:50,519
your nut sack like why don't you just

251
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:51,958
find one that doesn't stab you with a

252
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:54,600
butter knife in your nut sack it would

253
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:56,518
be that easy in my opinion uh this plant

254
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:59,879
can't be that good that it's worth

255
00:08:56,519 --> 00:09:01,679
having this intersex trait so you asked

256
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:03,720
um what would be the best way to breed

257
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:06,000
out that intersex trait

258
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,379
um find one that is minimally intersex

259
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,179
which doesn't even make sense to me

260
00:09:07,379 --> 00:09:11,338
that's intersex intersex is intersex

261
00:09:09,179 --> 00:09:13,199
it's got to go but find one that doesn't

262
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:15,540
uh show intersex traits or minimal

263
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,700
pollinate that one with a stable solid

264
00:09:15,539 --> 00:09:19,860
male and then repeat the process keep

265
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:21,778
back Crossing with that mail and then

266
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:24,360
eventually you could wash out that trait

267
00:09:21,778 --> 00:09:26,639
but uh the first thing I wrote is why

268
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,839
don't you have other options like you've

269
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:29,220
got to have other options you're going

270
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,200
to get a free pack of seeds since you

271
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:32,879
sent me a question so you could start

272
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,519
with my seeds and not have to run those

273
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:36,958
intersex plants would be my theory uh my

274
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,120
dude I wish I had a better answer for

275
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:40,979
you my friend panda instead of telling

276
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,539
you uh don't breed with something that's

277
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:44,940
intersex that's not setting yourself up

278
00:09:42,539 --> 00:09:46,379
for success that's uh trying to work out

279
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,640
a problem with the plant that you know

280
00:09:46,379 --> 00:09:48,720
that's problematic when there are

281
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:51,600
thousands of packs of seeds available

282
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,920
that probably aren't as problematic so I

283
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,300
get one that doesn't stab you in the

284
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:56,338
nuts with the butter knife is my theory

285
00:09:54,299 --> 00:09:58,379
and then breed with that so I'm going to

286
00:09:56,339 --> 00:09:59,940
send you a free pack of seeds because if

287
00:09:58,379 --> 00:10:01,559
you send me a question on the grow help

288
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:04,500
Tab and I read that question here on the

289
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:06,419
show you in free seeds my friend panda

290
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:08,100
as long as you are in the states and I

291
00:10:06,419 --> 00:10:09,599
don't have to ship to Canada please do

292
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,278
send me your shipping address with a

293
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,500
real name I can't call you panda on your

294
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:14,820
box it's not gonna fly but send me a

295
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:17,399
name and an address and I will send you

296
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:19,379
a free pack of irie genetic seeds my

297
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:20,879
friend if you are in Canada let me know

298
00:10:19,379 --> 00:10:22,679
and I will send you a T-shirt and some

299
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:24,539
stickers I apologize like I said before

300
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:26,399
you just can't have any seeds up there

301
00:10:24,539 --> 00:10:28,319
in Canada until I get your government to

302
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:30,059
play nice with me also I wish I had a

303
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,860
better answer for you but as a breeder

304
00:10:30,059 --> 00:10:33,479
who puts a lot of work into this plant

305
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:35,759
has a lot of passion for this plant I

306
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:38,039
can't find the heart in me to tell you

307
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:39,299
to breed with this intersex plant I tell

308
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:41,399
you to get the [ __ ] away from that

309
00:10:39,299 --> 00:10:43,079
that's what probably what a therapist

310
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:44,639
and a good breeder and a good grower and

311
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,920
a good podcaster should tell you to do

312
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:48,958
run from that problem you can do better

313
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:50,338
all right let's move forward also bro

314
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:51,778
thank you for the great question and I

315
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:53,100
hope to see pictures of those seeds when

316
00:10:51,778 --> 00:10:54,600
you do get them I've got another

317
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:56,820
question here in front of me this one

318
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:59,159
also did come from the grow help tab on

319
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:01,320
the irie genetics website this person

320
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:03,240
also is going to win a free pack of irie

321
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:05,879
genetic seeds congratulations my dude

322
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:08,339
this one is a general grow question and

323
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:10,679
it goes just like this it says Rasta

324
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:12,480
Jeff I love your podcast thank you for

325
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:13,620
the great info you are very welcome my

326
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,300
friend thank you for being a great

327
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:17,278
audience member and sending a great

328
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:19,620
question it says I have recently

329
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:21,299
embarked in pollen chucking just for fun

330
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:23,399
that's a fun Endeavor I hope it goes

331
00:11:21,299 --> 00:11:26,399
well for you then it says can you please

332
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:28,379
explain how to finish a seed harvest the

333
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:31,139
first detailed question is should the

334
00:11:28,379 --> 00:11:33,240
light schedule stay at 12 12. of

335
00:11:31,139 --> 00:11:36,720
um I've done several podcasts on

336
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:39,539
changing my light schedule from 12 12 to

337
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:42,420
18 hours on and six hours off four

338
00:11:39,539 --> 00:11:44,519
seated crops if you've bred made

339
00:11:42,419 --> 00:11:46,319
completed several crops of seeds before

340
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:48,720
and you know what you're looking for in

341
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,700
a seated crop I always recommend turning

342
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,560
that light to 18 6. on your first time

343
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:54,000
maybe wait a little while to do that

344
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:56,159
just so you could see what happens with

345
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,440
the plants understand it before you [ __ ]

346
00:11:56,159 --> 00:12:00,539
with it but the first few times you

347
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:02,820
breed do that 12 12 all the way till the

348
00:12:00,539 --> 00:12:04,919
end then eventually you're going to want

349
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:07,459
to change that white timer to 18 hours

350
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:10,620
on and six hours off after pollination

351
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:12,958
if my plants are seeded I generally do

352
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:15,240
that about 10 days after pollination

353
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:17,578
that's my goal so I'll pollinate 10 days

354
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:19,019
later I'll flip that timer back to 18 6.

355
00:12:17,578 --> 00:12:21,179
now you're gonna freak out you're gonna

356
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:23,278
say that's gonna [ __ ] up my plants no

357
00:12:21,179 --> 00:12:25,578
that would [ __ ] up your flowers if you

358
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:28,200
were growing for usable smokable

359
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:30,419
photographable buds as photographable a

360
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:32,040
word anyway photogenic buds that that

361
00:12:30,419 --> 00:12:33,719
would [ __ ] up your buds these plants are

362
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:35,039
going to look like [ __ ] these plants are

363
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:37,379
going to look like [ __ ] they're going to

364
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:39,000
start to re-vege but that's not a big

365
00:12:37,379 --> 00:12:40,320
deal because we're not growing for buds

366
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,458
I'm not growing for buds when I'm

367
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:47,579
seeding my plants my 100 focus is seed I

368
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:49,739
want as many and as many healthy and as

369
00:12:47,578 --> 00:12:51,778
many high quality germinating seeds and

370
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:53,820
as few crappy white seeds as I can

371
00:12:51,778 --> 00:12:56,519
possibly have in my Harvest and I

372
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:58,560
achieved that by pollinating two times I

373
00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:00,120
pollinate at the peak pollination time I

374
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:02,278
let that male plant build up a load

375
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:04,740
again pollinate one more time cut him

376
00:13:02,278 --> 00:13:06,720
down let the plants absorb that pollen

377
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:09,180
let them adjust for about a week then I

378
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,579
switch that light to 18 6 and I get a

379
00:13:09,179 --> 00:13:13,799
tremendous amount of positively healthy

380
00:13:11,578 --> 00:13:15,719
amazing beautiful seeds so that's the

381
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:17,219
way I do that now the reason I like to

382
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:19,560
give those plants more light is because

383
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:21,899
I believe light is the number one source

384
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:24,059
of energy for these plants so I give it

385
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:25,860
more light that lets more energy into

386
00:13:24,059 --> 00:13:28,379
the plant they can metabolize more guess

387
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:31,320
what they can feed that seed more also

388
00:13:28,379 --> 00:13:33,240
you can cut down on several days of the

389
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,800
flowering cycle most of the time it'll

390
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,720
take about six to seven maybe eight

391
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:38,399
weeks for some seeds to be done you'll

392
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,980
have them done by the end of week six

393
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:42,720
with this method so by changing the

394
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:44,278
light cycle back it does make the plants

395
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,899
look a little bit wonky they start to

396
00:13:44,278 --> 00:13:47,939
re-vege they get a little bit fluffy

397
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:49,799
they start growing kind of crazy but

398
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:52,380
that's not the point we make a bunch of

399
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:54,000
amazing seeds is what I'm going for now

400
00:13:52,379 --> 00:13:55,379
if you don't want your plants to look

401
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,659
crazy if you don't want them to grow

402
00:13:55,379 --> 00:14:00,120
wildly if you don't want them to re-vege

403
00:13:57,659 --> 00:14:02,458
only change them back to 18 6 for the

404
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:04,078
last 10 to 14 days at the end of your

405
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:06,119
flowering cycle this will still speed

406
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:07,859
you up this will still give you healthy

407
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:10,799
fat seeds but it won't make the plant

408
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:12,419
room look like [ __ ] as bad alright so do

409
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:14,338
change the light cycle is something I do

410
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:16,620
same temperature and humidity basically

411
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:18,060
yes sometimes I don't like the room to

412
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:19,740
get too humid when the seeds are in

413
00:14:18,059 --> 00:14:21,299
there I may let it get a little bit if

414
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:23,399
you've got struggles if you can get it

415
00:14:21,299 --> 00:14:26,099
too humid or too dry I would prefer to

416
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:28,019
dry with the seeds in there also don't

417
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,459
spray the plants once they've been at

418
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:31,200
all I was going to say once they've been

419
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:32,819
pollinated don't spray them and I spit

420
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:35,100
as I said it which is pretty ironic I

421
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:36,240
sprayed it and saved it but don't spray

422
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:38,459
the plants if you're going to breed to

423
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,320
them you want all those pistols to be as

424
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:42,539
healthy and fat and robust as possible

425
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:45,240
so avoid any sprays on those plants

426
00:14:42,539 --> 00:14:47,458
especially thick oils before and or

427
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:49,019
after pollination you may want to use

428
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:51,479
predator bugs in there if you're going

429
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:54,179
to use a pest prevention program The

430
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:56,879
Predator bugs may be ideal so same tip

431
00:14:54,179 --> 00:14:59,578
in humidity keep the feeding flour

432
00:14:56,879 --> 00:15:02,519
nutrition or some NPK ratio thanks in

433
00:14:59,578 --> 00:15:03,958
advance so generally you don't need to

434
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:05,639
add the bloom boosters because you're

435
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:07,078
not making big fat buds we're not

436
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:09,240
growing for the buds like I was talking

437
00:15:07,078 --> 00:15:10,739
about earlier we're growing for seed so

438
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:13,079
you don't need the bloom boosters in

439
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:14,399
there as much all the the bat guano the

440
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:16,259
uh what's what's the product the bud

441
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,820
swell I would take out the buds well

442
00:15:16,259 --> 00:15:19,740
because I don't need the buds to swell I

443
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:22,199
want seed swell which is a totally

444
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:25,560
different feeding regimen so I kind of

445
00:15:22,198 --> 00:15:27,179
stick to a vegetative nutrient with a

446
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:28,859
lot of microbes and add a little bit of

447
00:15:27,179 --> 00:15:30,419
more calmag than usual

448
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:32,459
and I said this on another podcast

449
00:15:30,419 --> 00:15:34,078
recently I don't think I've ever talked

450
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:36,659
about this publicly until I was on that

451
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:39,000
cannabis podcast but add some Amino

452
00:15:36,659 --> 00:15:40,198
products to your seed regimen when

453
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,240
you're feeding the plants that are

454
00:15:40,198 --> 00:15:43,859
seated and those Liquid Aminos will help

455
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,959
you create more healthy fatter more

456
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:48,000
robust seeds which will also be more

457
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:51,838
resistant to problems when they do grow

458
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,759
so add that uh the liquid aminos uh

459
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,980
boost up the Cal Mag just a little bit

460
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:57,958
and then feed that vegetative nutrient

461
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:59,579
is basically what you want to do put

462
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:00,778
some microbes in there feed whatever

463
00:15:59,578 --> 00:16:03,659
else you feed to keep that plant

464
00:16:00,778 --> 00:16:05,820
optimized and healthy but basically base

465
00:16:03,659 --> 00:16:08,338
notes a basic NPK from your vegetative

466
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:09,720
nutrients a little bit of extra Cal Mag

467
00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:11,339
just to boost that up and then some

468
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:13,740
liquid amino products would definitely

469
00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:15,959
help in there if you can so I think that

470
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:18,060
is most of how to finish the seed

471
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:19,979
Harvest do you mean like when they're

472
00:16:18,059 --> 00:16:21,239
done so eventually the seeds are going

473
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,620
to start getting harder right you'll

474
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:24,539
start seeing them popping out of the

475
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:26,039
plants uh they'll just start peeking out

476
00:16:24,539 --> 00:16:27,419
at the top the plants will pop open the

477
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:28,919
calyx will pop open a little seed will

478
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:30,419
pop out of there the Brack will open up

479
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:32,698
it'll be peeking out like I'm almost

480
00:16:30,419 --> 00:16:33,899
ready daddy uh pull some of those seeds

481
00:16:32,698 --> 00:16:36,059
out of there from different parts of the

482
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:38,039
plant and give them a squeeze if they

483
00:16:36,059 --> 00:16:39,359
rupture they're not ready yet if you can

484
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:41,039
squeeze it pretty good to where you get

485
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,620
a dent in your finger a little indention

486
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:46,198
a little Mark that seed is probably done

487
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:47,578
you should know by now what a done seed

488
00:16:46,198 --> 00:16:49,379
looks like you've played with so many

489
00:16:47,578 --> 00:16:50,758
seeds right you've grown them you could

490
00:16:49,379 --> 00:16:52,919
roll it on the table and press it it

491
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:55,259
doesn't pop that's what you want but you

492
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:56,759
can also go too far so once they start

493
00:16:55,259 --> 00:16:58,440
heart being hard enough to where they

494
00:16:56,759 --> 00:16:59,820
don't crunch you want to take them out

495
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,620
pretty soon after that because if you

496
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:02,940
wait too long they'll become too hard

497
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:04,859
and they'll be hard to germinate and

498
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:06,360
when you put them in the water or the

499
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:08,159
root cubes or whatever they won't pop

500
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:09,719
open you'll have to scar them or crunch

501
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,120
them a little bit to get them pop to pop

502
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:13,500
open so when they're hard enough that is

503
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:15,719
about when it is Harvest time you'll

504
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:17,759
have to determine that on your own the

505
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:19,558
way that I harvest this is just how I do

506
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:21,179
it there are a thousand ways to skin a

507
00:17:19,558 --> 00:17:23,459
cat you pick your way I'm gonna tell you

508
00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:25,140
the way that I do it a few days before

509
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:27,298
Harvest time I'll go in the grow room

510
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:28,860
and pick off all of the big leaves any

511
00:17:27,298 --> 00:17:30,839
Leaf I can pull off I just take it off

512
00:17:28,859 --> 00:17:32,279
right now I don't need that coming in

513
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:34,319
the dry room with me at all that's just

514
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:36,298
gonna keep humidity in the room and I

515
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:37,859
don't want that with my seed drying so

516
00:17:36,298 --> 00:17:40,259
just get all those big leaves off

517
00:17:37,859 --> 00:17:41,819
anything I can take off chop it off then

518
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:43,500
I stop watering I let the plants get

519
00:17:41,819 --> 00:17:45,000
kind of dry before I cut them down I

520
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:47,279
don't need all that extra humidity in

521
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,660
the grow room or in the dry room so I'll

522
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:50,759
let them dry a little bit don't water

523
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:52,679
them then I cut them down then I take

524
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:54,779
the plant tag that is in the pot and I

525
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:56,759
attach that to the plant just use some

526
00:17:54,779 --> 00:17:58,440
duct tape or a wrap or whatever and make

527
00:17:56,759 --> 00:18:00,119
sure that plant tag stays with my plant

528
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:02,100
I don't want to [ __ ] this part up it's

529
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:04,259
very important to me so I got my plant

530
00:18:02,099 --> 00:18:05,879
my plant tag traveling together I put

531
00:18:04,259 --> 00:18:07,980
that on a I've got a little hanger thing

532
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:10,380
that I use and I hang those in a spot in

533
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:11,880
the dry and cure area I chop all of the

534
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:13,679
plants down and I spread them out a

535
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:16,799
little bit and I just let them hang dry

536
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:18,840
I've got these um they're sterlite bins

537
00:18:16,798 --> 00:18:20,519
they're actually bins that are made to

538
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:21,959
put like store your clothes or your

539
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:23,940
shoes in and they slide underneath the

540
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:25,200
bed they got wheels on one end these

541
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:26,940
bins are made to slide under the bed

542
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,500
they're kind of shallow I like these

543
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:30,960
because I can set them underneath the

544
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:32,460
plant and as the plant dries if any of

545
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,919
the seeds do fall out it'll fall down

546
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:37,440
into that bin eventually these plants

547
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:39,720
are going to get real real dry I don't

548
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,640
really pay attention to

549
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:43,740
um temperature humidity airflow or

550
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:45,720
anything like that in this room the room

551
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:47,339
is just naturally ambiently acceptable

552
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:49,620
it's a cool it's a decent room it's cool

553
00:18:47,339 --> 00:18:51,000
it's dry it's dark it's very acceptable

554
00:18:49,619 --> 00:18:53,399
for having plants I don't have to adjust

555
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,200
anything for the drying and curing of

556
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,700
seeded plants in this room so in this

557
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,220
room they'll be drying about 10 to 14

558
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:00,419
days I want to get them real dry so once

559
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:01,980
they start getting dry enough to where

560
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:03,900
I'm worried about the buds crumbling and

561
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:05,880
the seeds falling out I will take the

562
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:08,640
plant and basically cut the sticks off

563
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:10,080
and take a glove and just grab the

564
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,179
bottom of the branch and just pull the

565
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:13,798
branch out to where all the buds fall

566
00:19:12,179 --> 00:19:15,179
off into that Rubbermaid or that

567
00:19:13,798 --> 00:19:17,279
Sterilite bin that I was talking about

568
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:18,179
earlier just catch all the and seeds are

569
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:19,918
going to fall out as this happens

570
00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:21,298
depending on how dry those buds are

571
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:22,500
it'll just go crunch crunch crunch

572
00:19:21,298 --> 00:19:24,538
crunch crunch and it'll fall right into

573
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,859
that bin I'm collecting all the buds and

574
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:28,140
all the seeds into there I'll do that

575
00:19:25,859 --> 00:19:30,119
with every plant and carefully do not

576
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:31,500
cross the sea seeds from one bin to the

577
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:33,479
other make sure that you move the bins

578
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:35,339
when you're pulling [ __ ] so seeds don't

579
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,839
fly into the wrong bin so I'll get all

580
00:19:35,339 --> 00:19:38,459
of the buds off of the sticks now I've

581
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:40,678
just got a bunch of bins with sticks

582
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:42,720
then I'll put on fresh gloves because by

583
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:44,100
now my gloves are caked and torn put on

584
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,140
some fresh gloves then I go to those

585
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:48,359
bins and sometimes I wear a mask too

586
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:49,980
because this can get very dusty then I

587
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:51,240
let it get super dry and I just take the

588
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,558
buds in my hands and just crunch them

589
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:54,419
crunch crunch crunch crunch crunch just

590
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:56,339
rub all the buds through my hands

591
00:19:54,419 --> 00:19:57,780
there's other ways to do this I've

592
00:19:56,339 --> 00:19:59,579
thrown the buds into a five gallon

593
00:19:57,779 --> 00:20:02,220
bucket and use the paint stirrer paddle

594
00:19:59,579 --> 00:20:03,599
on a drill it is and that'll go ahead

595
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:05,759
and spin all your [ __ ] seeds out of

596
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:07,199
your buds real quick but uh try to be

597
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:08,579
gentle with the seeds break them up with

598
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,740
my hands break them up with the drill

599
00:20:08,579 --> 00:20:12,000
bit I've used a big spoon and gone in

600
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:14,038
there and just used a spoon to break up

601
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,200
the buds I want to get that turned into

602
00:20:14,038 --> 00:20:19,140
dust I want to beat all that bud

603
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:20,759
material into dust then I take my bin

604
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:22,679
and shake it now at this point all the

605
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:24,298
seeds that fall into the bottom most of

606
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:26,880
the weed material is up at the top we

607
00:20:24,298 --> 00:20:29,160
call that the chaff at this point I

608
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,539
basically kind of scoop that off

609
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,980
um don't go too deep to where you're

610
00:20:30,538 --> 00:20:34,019
getting to the seeds and just scoop the

611
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:35,759
chaff right off the top set that to the

612
00:20:34,019 --> 00:20:37,319
side give it a shake make sure there are

613
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:39,119
no seeds in there you'll be cool then at

614
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:41,220
this point you've got to get the seeds

615
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:42,719
out of all of that weed or the weed out

616
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:45,240
of all of those seeds is how I look at

617
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,620
it at this point but I use a machine to

618
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:48,839
do it I've got a little machine that's

619
00:20:46,619 --> 00:20:50,459
got a couple leveled angles and a

620
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:51,839
computer fan and it catches all the junk

621
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:54,120
in one drawer and the seeds go into

622
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:55,740
another that machine was quite expensive

623
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:57,178
you could probably build one I'm sure

624
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:59,400
there are seed sorter machines available

625
00:20:57,179 --> 00:21:01,080
online but you're gonna have to figure

626
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,820
out a way to sort all the seeds out of

627
00:21:01,079 --> 00:21:04,980
that junk I've seen people use a vacuum

628
00:21:02,819 --> 00:21:06,720
don't turn it up super high and don't go

629
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:08,460
hard with it but you can if you've got

630
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,620
the seeds in a bucket or a bin with

631
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:12,240
material on top you can gently just kind

632
00:21:10,619 --> 00:21:14,038
of feather that vacuum through there and

633
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,200
stir things and you can pick up the weed

634
00:21:14,038 --> 00:21:18,359
material and leave the seeds because the

635
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:20,460
weed material is much lighter than the

636
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:22,439
seed so if you get the feel for it if

637
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:23,819
you're clumsy if you're a goofy kind of

638
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:25,798
person don't try that when you're going

639
00:21:23,819 --> 00:21:27,599
to suck up all the [ __ ] seeds but if

640
00:21:25,798 --> 00:21:29,220
you got some Faith In Yourself kind of

641
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:31,319
you can suck up the chaff material

642
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:33,058
without sucking up the seeds so at this

643
00:21:31,319 --> 00:21:35,038
point I've separated all of the material

644
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:37,200
from all of the seeds I will leave the

645
00:21:35,038 --> 00:21:39,779
seeds sitting out in a cool dry dark

646
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:42,120
safe place for a little while I have had

647
00:21:39,779 --> 00:21:43,859
a friend sort his seeds before this was

648
00:21:42,119 --> 00:21:46,139
not me this was really a friend I would

649
00:21:43,859 --> 00:21:47,939
admit it If This Were me he had a bag of

650
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:50,100
seeds on a tail or a cup of seeds on a

651
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:52,919
table they were open and a [ __ ] Mouse

652
00:21:50,099 --> 00:21:54,359
stole the seeds I'm not joking a lot of

653
00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:55,679
good seeds we never got to grow that

654
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:57,479
plant we don't know what he even made

655
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:59,340
because the mouse got all of his beans

656
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:01,019
so think about that put him somewhere

657
00:21:59,339 --> 00:22:02,639
where Critters won't get to them but I

658
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:04,980
leave them open for a while and let them

659
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,360
get really dry sometimes I put one of

660
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:08,819
those desiccant packs in there to suck

661
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:10,740
up the moisture not a Boveda pack a

662
00:22:08,819 --> 00:22:13,319
desiccant pack something to suck up the

663
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:15,120
moisture not add moisture but I want to

664
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:17,158
get all the moisture out of there

665
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:18,839
then I either put them depending on how

666
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:21,600
many I've got sometimes they go in a big

667
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:24,538
one gallon bag jars and carefully label

668
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:26,579
that bag I will write the new strain

669
00:22:24,538 --> 00:22:28,919
name so let's just say frequency shift

670
00:22:26,579 --> 00:22:30,779
I'll put frequency shift then I'll label

671
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:32,340
about I've got a seed counter also I run

672
00:22:30,779 --> 00:22:34,079
them through the seed counter I'll put

673
00:22:32,339 --> 00:22:36,658
how many seeds are in that bag frequency

674
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:38,939
shift 20 000 seeds then I'll put the

675
00:22:36,659 --> 00:22:40,799
cross New York City Diesel to a reversed

676
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:42,600
Golden Goat then I'll put the harvest

677
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:44,759
date on there so I know when those seeds

678
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:46,199
were pulled I just like to Mark [ __ ] so

679
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:47,940
that I know how many seeds when they

680
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:50,220
were pulled though if there's a problem

681
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:51,659
if you say hey bro if several people say

682
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:52,980
hey bro I bought a bunch of these seeds

683
00:22:51,659 --> 00:22:54,659
and they're not working I can look at

684
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:56,099
that whole batch and then I can run

685
00:22:54,659 --> 00:22:57,539
those myself and see if there's a

686
00:22:56,099 --> 00:22:59,339
problem in there that I missed before

687
00:22:57,538 --> 00:23:00,839
that you guys happen to discover because

688
00:22:59,339 --> 00:23:03,178
you grow a lot more of those seeds than

689
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:06,298
I do I run small batches and then you

690
00:23:03,179 --> 00:23:08,038
guys run I run 50 or 100 you guys Run 10

691
00:23:06,298 --> 00:23:09,298
each and there's thousands of you doing

692
00:23:08,038 --> 00:23:11,400
it so that's a lot of [ __ ] seeds

693
00:23:09,298 --> 00:23:13,259
being grown but so that's basically how

694
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:15,059
I do a seed Harvest

695
00:23:13,259 --> 00:23:17,519
um I pollinate I change the light skin

696
00:23:15,058 --> 00:23:19,980
schedule I feed them pretty solid I

697
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:21,900
defoliate heavily toward the end let

698
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:24,240
them get dry chop them down let them get

699
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:26,820
super [ __ ] dry pull off the buds into

700
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,679
the bins crunch up the buds uh pull out

701
00:23:26,819 --> 00:23:31,200
the seeds count the seeds put them in a

702
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:32,340
jar and get them dry as [ __ ] that's the

703
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,538
basics

704
