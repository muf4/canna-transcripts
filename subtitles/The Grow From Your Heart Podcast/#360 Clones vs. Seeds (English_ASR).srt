30
00:01:06,989 --> 00:01:10,289
guys let's keep moving this show forward

31
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:11,579
because I have got a lot to talk about

32
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:13,770
we're gonna get back into the grow

33
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:15,959
lessons on this episode this is going to

34
00:01:13,769 --> 00:01:18,179
be the 8th lesson in a long series of

35
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:20,639
grow lessons so far we've talked about

36
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:22,740
our goals and ideas and where to set up

37
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,180
our grow we've gone over the equipment

38
00:01:22,739 --> 00:01:25,739
we've talked about the lights we've

39
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,720
talked about our containers we've talked

40
00:01:25,739 --> 00:01:29,879
about soil and medium we've talked about

41
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:32,400
pest control and if you're not caught up

42
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:34,828
I recommend you go back to episode 351

43
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,329
and started there there are a couple of

44
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:38,069
interruptions in the lessons I will

45
00:01:36,328 --> 00:01:39,719
sneak in a few episodes that are not

46
00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:41,578
grow lessons while I'm doing this series

47
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:43,438
sometimes I'll need to read emails

48
00:01:41,578 --> 00:01:45,328
sometimes I'll need to answer questions

49
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:47,459
coming up we're gonna have some iTunes

50
00:01:45,328 --> 00:01:49,469
customer reviews things like that will

51
00:01:47,459 --> 00:01:50,879
disrupt the lessons but I think it keeps

52
00:01:49,469 --> 00:01:53,879
the show's fresh it keeps me motivated

53
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:55,978
and it keeps it fun but in this episode

54
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:57,780
we will continue the grow lessons but

55
00:01:55,978 --> 00:01:59,879
before we get there let's talk about a

56
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:01,680
couple of things I kind of overlooked

57
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:04,408
while we were talking about building our

58
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,630
grow it might be a good idea to add a

59
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:08,340
smoke detector to each grow room

60
00:02:06,629 --> 00:02:10,889
wherever you've got a grow light hanging

61
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:13,830
have a smoke detector in that room also

62
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:16,409
I would recommend a fire extinguisher

63
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:18,240
outside of each grow room now I hope you

64
00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:20,159
don't have to use it but if that smoke

65
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:22,350
alarm goes off you'd rather have that

66
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:24,030
fire extinguisher outside of the grow

67
00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:25,799
room so you don't have to open the door

68
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:28,199
run in there get the fire extinguisher

69
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,850
then start working on the fire if it's

70
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:31,289
outside of the grow room you can just

71
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:33,210
grab it you can be a little more

72
00:02:31,289 --> 00:02:35,129
prepared you can get in there you can

73
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:36,530
start putting out the fire also if

74
00:02:35,129 --> 00:02:38,879
you've never used a fire extinguisher

75
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:41,129
maybe read the instructions maybe

76
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,719
understand what to do in case of a fire

77
00:02:41,129 --> 00:02:45,150
maybe just read that little book that

78
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:46,889
comes with it and also make sure it

79
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:49,319
stays charged it's got a gauge on it

80
00:02:46,889 --> 00:02:50,969
it's got a red a yellow and a green make

81
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:53,069
sure your little arrow is in the green

82
00:02:50,969 --> 00:02:54,569
at all times you might want to think

83
00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:56,759
about some sort of automated fire

84
00:02:54,569 --> 00:02:58,469
suppression system they make things that

85
00:02:56,759 --> 00:03:00,060
hang in the middle of the grow room it's

86
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:02,340
got a little heat sensor in it if it

87
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:04,229
gets too hot it basically explodes it

88
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:06,240
releases a powder that rains down into

89
00:03:04,229 --> 00:03:08,519
the grow room that will put out any fire

90
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:10,890
that's in the room think about some sort

91
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:13,290
of way to detect and suppress a fire in

92
00:03:10,889 --> 00:03:15,869
your grow room should that situation

93
00:03:13,289 --> 00:03:17,609
occur another thing I overlooked when we

94
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:19,620
were designing and building our room was

95
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:22,050
an automated watering or an assisted

96
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:23,939
watering system an automated watering

97
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:26,189
system can really speed things up once

98
00:03:23,939 --> 00:03:27,870
you get into a larger grow it also makes

99
00:03:26,189 --> 00:03:30,150
the plants really happy because the

100
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:31,830
plants love consistency if you're

101
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:34,620
interested in designing an auto watering

102
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:37,800
system I did a full episode about auto

103
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:39,659
watering on episode 335 unfortunately

104
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,100
there were some audio technical

105
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:43,229
difficulties and parts of the episode

106
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:45,389
chopped out if you listened to that

107
00:03:43,229 --> 00:03:47,789
episode and you still have specific

108
00:03:45,389 --> 00:03:50,039
questions send me an email I grow from

109
00:03:47,789 --> 00:03:52,769
your heart at hotmail.com and we will

110
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:54,269
get your auto water system dialed in all

111
00:03:52,769 --> 00:03:56,730
right so at this point we should have

112
00:03:54,269 --> 00:03:58,920
goals and reasonable expectations for

113
00:03:56,729 --> 00:04:00,899
our grow we should have a good idea of

114
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:02,339
where we want to put the grow we should

115
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:05,310
have a good idea of the gear we want to

116
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:06,689
buy the lights the pots the medium we

117
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:08,699
should also have a good idea of pest

118
00:04:06,689 --> 00:04:11,129
control now we've talked a little bit

119
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:13,229
about fire suppression I've also done an

120
00:04:11,129 --> 00:04:15,689
in-depth episode on fire suppression

121
00:04:13,229 --> 00:04:17,909
that is episode 260 if you want to learn

122
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:20,850
a lot about fire safety in your grow

123
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:22,860
episode number 260 will teach you a lot

124
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:24,510
there if you decide you want to add an

125
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:27,569
auto watering system to your grow

126
00:04:24,509 --> 00:04:28,259
episode 335 is the episode all about

127
00:04:27,569 --> 00:04:29,730
Auto

128
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:32,039
watering so that should get us all

129
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:33,509
caught up the room is ready we've got

130
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,370
the gear planned out we've got a good

131
00:04:33,509 --> 00:04:36,750
idea of pest management we know what

132
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:38,399
we're gonna feed the plants we know how

133
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:40,110
to take care of a fire we know how to

134
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:42,060
set up an auto watering system if we

135
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:43,800
need one now we're getting to the fun

136
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:46,829
part of this journey let's start

137
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:48,120
thinking about plants what do you want

138
00:04:46,829 --> 00:04:50,759
to grow what do you want to dedicate

139
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:53,519
your time your energy your space and a

140
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:56,399
bunch of money to over the next 90 to

141
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:57,089
120 days what strains have gotten your

142
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:59,189
attention

143
00:04:57,089 --> 00:05:01,379
what strains do you really enjoy smoking

144
00:04:59,189 --> 00:05:02,689
does something work for you medically

145
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:05,129
does something work for you

146
00:05:02,689 --> 00:05:07,319
recreationally is there something that

147
00:05:05,129 --> 00:05:09,750
is reliable that every time you smoke it

148
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:11,639
you get the desired effect this is gonna

149
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:13,860
fall back to the very first episode of

150
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:15,719
this grow lesson series are you growing

151
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:17,550
this for yourself are you growing it for

152
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,050
a medical patient you have a lot of

153
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:21,210
things to think about when it comes to

154
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:23,790
deciding what strains to grow in your

155
00:05:21,209 --> 00:05:25,919
new garden in legal medical and

156
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:28,110
recreational states we have a lot more

157
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:30,360
options for acquiring genetic material

158
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:32,610
we can go to a dispensary and buy a

159
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,500
clone off of the shelf we can go to our

160
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:36,240
friends garden and ask them for clones

161
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,670
and they can give sell or trade those

162
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,920
clones to us we can acquire clones here

163
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:43,020
very easily in Colorado in fact I went

164
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:45,090
to a dispensary just a few days ago to

165
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:46,859
pick up these fuego extracts and they

166
00:05:45,089 --> 00:05:48,359
had two different variety of clones on

167
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:50,759
the Shelf that looked very healthy

168
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:52,560
they had purple punch and dos Eidos on

169
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:54,810
the Shelf ready to go at a very

170
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,959
reasonable price so clones are readily

171
00:05:54,810 --> 00:06:00,449
available in Colorado seeds are also

172
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:02,009
available in some Colorado dispensaries

173
00:06:00,449 --> 00:06:03,629
so you can walk right into the store you

174
00:06:02,009 --> 00:06:05,639
can grab a pack of seeds and you can

175
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:07,139
start your new garden from seeds you

176
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:10,379
picked up at your local dispensary

177
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:12,599
clones and seeds are both viable options

178
00:06:10,379 --> 00:06:14,850
for starting a garden this episode is

179
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:18,210
going to focus on the great debate on

180
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:20,070
seeds versus clones before we get into

181
00:06:18,209 --> 00:06:22,500
that let's talk a little bit about how

182
00:06:20,069 --> 00:06:25,709
you can decide what strain you want to

183
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:27,389
grow the best way to do that is to smoke

184
00:06:25,709 --> 00:06:28,529
a bunch of different strains now if

185
00:06:27,389 --> 00:06:30,930
you're in a medical or recreational

186
00:06:28,529 --> 00:06:33,119
state that is a lot easier than if you

187
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:35,220
are in prohibition land if you're in

188
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,259
prohibition land who knows if the strain

189
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:38,880
you were buying is even really what

190
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:40,740
whoever is selling it to you is called

191
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:41,759
they're probably growing something and

192
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:44,160
they're calling everything

193
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,930
cookies because cookies sells anything

194
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,640
with the letters og at the end of it

195
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:50,189
sell so you've probably got something

196
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:52,110
cookies Oh G anything with the word fire

197
00:06:50,189 --> 00:06:54,449
in there works well so you probably you

198
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:56,910
guys are probably buying fire cookies og

199
00:06:54,449 --> 00:06:58,500
in prohibition land everywhere and it's

200
00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:00,540
probably whatever that person got a

201
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:02,250
clone of or whatever that person's

202
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:04,170
buying bulk of and they're just renaming

203
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:06,360
it because they know that names are hot

204
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:07,800
so in a prohibition state it's gonna be

205
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,360
a little bit harder maybe you'll get

206
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,490
lucky maybe you'll get a seed in your

207
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,410
bag of weed one day you can always grow

208
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:15,269
out those bag seeds sometimes you find

209
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:17,370
phenotypes very close to what you

210
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:19,169
started with also sometimes you find

211
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:20,759
hermaphrodites and problematic plants so

212
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:22,410
be prepared for that as well but

213
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:25,379
sometimes it is your only option

214
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:27,390
it's always an awkward situation asking

215
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:29,009
a grower for clones if you're a new

216
00:07:27,389 --> 00:07:30,629
grower and you're buying herb from

217
00:07:29,009 --> 00:07:31,949
somebody and you're like bro I really

218
00:07:30,629 --> 00:07:33,629
love this strain do you think I could

219
00:07:31,949 --> 00:07:35,879
get a clone that always presents an

220
00:07:33,629 --> 00:07:37,800
awkward situation first of all now you

221
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:39,149
both know you're growing if you're in a

222
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,560
prohibition state that makes things

223
00:07:39,149 --> 00:07:42,509
really weird for both of you

224
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,129
also like I doesn't want to release as

225
00:07:42,509 --> 00:07:46,289
genetics to you because now he's going

226
00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:48,089
to lose a customer so unless you're on a

227
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:51,090
really friendly basis with your weed guy

228
00:07:48,089 --> 00:07:52,949
I would avoid that conversation now in a

229
00:07:51,089 --> 00:07:54,899
legal state in a recreational or a

230
00:07:52,949 --> 00:07:56,939
medical state it's really easy to go

231
00:07:54,899 --> 00:07:59,279
find out what strains work best for you

232
00:07:56,939 --> 00:08:00,779
you go to the dispensary and you buy as

233
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:02,669
many grams as you can afford of

234
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:04,979
different varieties and you go home and

235
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:07,020
you smoke them you start fresh every day

236
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:09,000
and you try this strain I haven't smoked

237
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:10,409
this one yet let's smoke strain a and

238
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,360
you take a few notes and you see how it

239
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:14,010
works for you first thing in the morning

240
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,569
if you've got a target if you're trying

241
00:08:14,009 --> 00:08:16,920
to make your leg pain go away if you're

242
00:08:15,569 --> 00:08:18,689
trying to make your headache go away if

243
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,800
you're trying to make your back pain go

244
00:08:18,689 --> 00:08:22,649
away if you're trying to make your

245
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:25,680
anxiety go away document the level of

246
00:08:22,649 --> 00:08:27,959
which that element starts is it a5 is

247
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,389
that at a 10 okay I started off with a

248
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:32,879
level 5 leg pain I smoked the bowl of

249
00:08:30,389 --> 00:08:35,639
this strain a I know my leg pain is a

250
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:38,879
tattoo document that the next day I woke

251
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:41,399
up leg pains at a5 I smoked strain B now

252
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:42,509
my leg pain is still at a5 I obviously

253
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:44,579
don't want to buy any more of this [ __ ]

254
00:08:42,509 --> 00:08:47,189
then you want to go then the next day

255
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:49,230
day number 3 I woke up my leg pains at

256
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:51,450
a6 I smoked some of this now I'm a

257
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:52,680
tattoo this one might work well for me

258
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:54,600
let's put a little star by that and

259
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:55,479
remember what this is and then just keep

260
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,100
doing little test

261
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:59,379
that on yourself and with the flowers

262
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:01,629
and find out what strain works for you

263
00:08:59,379 --> 00:09:04,240
if you find a strain at one dispensary

264
00:09:01,629 --> 00:09:06,429
it works very well for you try to find

265
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,139
it at another dispensary and smoke that

266
00:09:06,429 --> 00:09:10,208
product because they have different

267
00:09:08,139 --> 00:09:12,129
growers they may have different clones

268
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:14,109
their product is gonna come out very

269
00:09:12,129 --> 00:09:16,059
different in the end even if we start

270
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:17,620
with the same clone to commercial

271
00:09:16,059 --> 00:09:19,719
growers will produce two very different

272
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:21,459
products so try them both and see if

273
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,899
it's the strain it might have just been

274
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:25,388
that one batch you might have just been

275
00:09:22,899 --> 00:09:27,639
that one grow but try different batches

276
00:09:25,389 --> 00:09:29,259
if possible I know it sounds like I'm

277
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:29,709
completely spoiled but this is a real

278
00:09:29,259 --> 00:09:32,139
thing

279
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:34,750
I can drive to ten dispensaries in my

280
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:36,759
area and probably five of them have

281
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:38,948
wedding cake and that wedding cake was

282
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:41,169
probably grown by three different grows

283
00:09:38,948 --> 00:09:43,000
and I bet you if I try all three of them

284
00:09:41,169 --> 00:09:44,379
they're all gonna have very subtle

285
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
nuances one will taste a little

286
00:09:44,379 --> 00:09:47,679
different one's gonna burn a little

287
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,778
different one's gonna have a better high

288
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:51,698
but they're all gonna have that wedding

289
00:09:49,778 --> 00:09:54,070
cake droopy I giggle II kind of thing

290
00:09:51,698 --> 00:09:56,229
going on so try to check them out from

291
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:58,000
different grows if you can make sure

292
00:09:56,230 --> 00:10:00,370
that it's the strain and not just that

293
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,110
one grower that did it for you now one

294
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:03,818
thing I want to loop back on we talked

295
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:06,250
about trying to get a clone from your

296
00:10:03,818 --> 00:10:08,708
grower if you do try to buy a clone from

297
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:11,198
your grower friend don't be offended

298
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:13,750
when he hits you with a really steep

299
00:10:11,198 --> 00:10:15,549
price think about this he's been selling

300
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:17,620
you herb for how long and now you're

301
00:10:15,549 --> 00:10:19,179
gonna grow your own how much money are

302
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:21,100
you taking out of his pocket I know

303
00:10:19,179 --> 00:10:22,750
you're gonna save that much money but

304
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:24,278
that guy's been relying on you as a

305
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:25,929
customer and now you're gonna try to

306
00:10:24,278 --> 00:10:28,480
grow your own he's gonna go dude this

307
00:10:25,929 --> 00:10:30,458
guy's gone you've got to put a fat chunk

308
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,930
in his pocket as a parting gift when he

309
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:33,309
gives you that clone that's why he needs

310
00:10:31,929 --> 00:10:34,929
so much for it also

311
00:10:33,309 --> 00:10:36,250
he's the only one growing that in town

312
00:10:34,929 --> 00:10:37,870
that's how he's living that's how he's

313
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:39,429
making his income you're gonna buy it

314
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:41,049
into that that genetic is gonna be out

315
00:10:39,429 --> 00:10:42,578
there how does he know you're not gonna

316
00:10:41,049 --> 00:10:44,019
run a bunch of it and flood the town

317
00:10:42,578 --> 00:10:46,028
with it so when they hit you with a

318
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:48,039
really high price for a clone in a

319
00:10:46,028 --> 00:10:49,539
prohibition state that's why it's

320
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:51,969
because that's how that person is living

321
00:10:49,539 --> 00:10:54,068
that is his income that's his artwork

322
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:55,629
he's probably Fino hunted that or he

323
00:10:54,068 --> 00:10:58,389
paid a whole lot of money for that clone

324
00:10:55,629 --> 00:11:00,850
himself so he's sharing his revenue

325
00:10:58,389 --> 00:11:02,709
stream with you and kind of opening up

326
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:04,959
the floodgates to put himself out of

327
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:06,729
business once you guys do a Fino hunt

328
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:07,899
and you found your own keeper you kind

329
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:09,490
of understand a little bit more

330
00:11:07,899 --> 00:11:11,379
especially in

331
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:13,000
prohibition state all right you guys

332
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:14,799
we've talked a little bit about deciding

333
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,690
what you want to grow what you want to

334
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:18,819
grow is up to you once you decide what

335
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:20,500
you want to grow if you pick something

336
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:22,390
that takes ten or twelve weeks and it

337
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,799
grows tall and skinny if that's really

338
00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:26,110
what you think you want to grow you're

339
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:28,479
gonna have to adapt to that plant don't

340
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:31,028
try to make that plant adapt to you that

341
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,560
is not how it works all right I've got a

342
00:11:31,028 --> 00:11:34,870
bunch of notes but I don't have a good

343
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:37,208
segue so let's just jump right into this

344
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:38,919
let's talk about the debate on seeds

345
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:40,719
versus clones you've decided what you

346
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:43,509
want to grow now do you want to grow it

347
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:45,670
from seed or from clone growing from

348
00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:48,700
either seed or clone both have their

349
00:11:45,669 --> 00:11:49,990
advantages and disadvantages something

350
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:52,330
you'll have to think about with both of

351
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:54,278
them is availability our clones

352
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:56,709
available where you are

353
00:11:54,278 --> 00:11:59,139
does somebody in your area grow that is

354
00:11:56,708 --> 00:12:01,119
willing to release clones to you for

355
00:11:59,139 --> 00:12:03,429
your personal production is there a

356
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:06,730
dispensary in your area that sells

357
00:12:03,429 --> 00:12:08,439
clones if I read correctly in Canada you

358
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:10,600
can ship clones to each other through

359
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:12,850
the mail so that's an option but if

360
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:15,040
nobody has clones near you they are not

361
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:17,889
available now if somebody does have

362
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:19,778
clones are they accurately labeled do

363
00:12:17,889 --> 00:12:22,419
they have the variety you're looking for

364
00:12:19,778 --> 00:12:24,159
and are they clean we'll talk about that

365
00:12:22,419 --> 00:12:26,409
in just a minute it's kind of the same

366
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:28,000
story with seeds do you know somebody

367
00:12:26,409 --> 00:12:29,799
that's got seeds that is willing to

368
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,929
share some with you and if you get them

369
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:33,939
from somebody are they accurately

370
00:12:31,929 --> 00:12:35,889
labeled and do they have the variety

371
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:37,810
that you're looking for one of the

372
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:39,879
advantages of seeds is it there are

373
00:12:37,809 --> 00:12:43,028
shops on the internet that will send

374
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:44,588
seeds directly to your mailbox if you

375
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:47,019
were in a prohibition state and you

376
00:12:44,589 --> 00:12:49,149
order seeds from an online vendor it is

377
00:12:47,019 --> 00:12:51,220
your responsibility to keep those seeds

378
00:12:49,149 --> 00:12:53,649
in the packaging and do not allow them

379
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:56,680
to grow if it is illegal to grow them in

380
00:12:53,649 --> 00:12:59,470
your area save them as souvenirs and

381
00:12:56,679 --> 00:13:02,409
collectibles until legalization happens

382
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:05,259
in your area or until you move to a

383
00:13:02,409 --> 00:13:07,539
legalized state but there are several

384
00:13:05,259 --> 00:13:10,088
online vendors who will send you seeds

385
00:13:07,539 --> 00:13:11,740
to keep as collectibles if you do choose

386
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:13,980
to germinate those and grow those

387
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:16,629
yourself that is your responsibility

388
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:19,240
anything that happens from that is up to

389
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:21,610
you but seeds are available online and

390
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:23,610
seeds don't die in the mail

391
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:27,610
now I want to do a friendly debate on

392
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:29,289
clone vs. seed but to keep it fair we

393
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:31,810
need to act like there is a place where

394
00:13:29,289 --> 00:13:34,269
we can go that has clones and seeds

395
00:13:31,809 --> 00:13:36,309
available and just about any variety we

396
00:13:34,269 --> 00:13:37,929
could imagine think about the strain

397
00:13:36,309 --> 00:13:40,149
that you chose you want to grow for your

398
00:13:37,929 --> 00:13:42,279
first time let's imagine there's a

399
00:13:40,149 --> 00:13:44,649
dispensary where we can go and they've

400
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:46,539
got flowers of that strain grown by

401
00:13:44,649 --> 00:13:48,490
three different growers so we can smoke

402
00:13:46,539 --> 00:13:50,610
it from three different people and make

403
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:52,779
sure it's what we like they've also got

404
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:54,430
extracts there so if you're into smoking

405
00:13:52,779 --> 00:13:56,470
concentrates they've got full-spectrum

406
00:13:54,429 --> 00:13:57,039
extract they've got shatter they've got

407
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,480
wax

408
00:13:57,039 --> 00:14:00,009
they've got whatever you're into that

409
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,170
way so you can make sure it's the strain

410
00:14:00,009 --> 00:14:05,049
you desire for your concentrates then

411
00:14:02,169 --> 00:14:07,689
also they have got seeds and clones of

412
00:14:05,049 --> 00:14:09,849
your favorite strain ready for you there

413
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:12,310
now you've got the option do you want to

414
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:14,019
buy seeds or clones for your grow let's

415
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:16,000
start a friendly debate right here now

416
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:18,370
before I get too far into this let me

417
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,779
give a quick explanation on what a clone

418
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:21,190
is I'm pretty sure most people know what

419
00:14:19,779 --> 00:14:22,959
a seed is that's a little beam that

420
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:24,730
grows into a big plant it came out of

421
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:27,430
another plant now let's talk about a

422
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:29,620
clone a clone is basically a photocopy

423
00:14:27,429 --> 00:14:31,449
of a plant we take a cutting off of a

424
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:33,700
plant and it roots and now we have a

425
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:35,920
photocopy of the plant we started with

426
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:38,170
cannabis plants are annuals which means

427
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:40,959
they only live for one year or one cycle

428
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:43,389
so we grow it from seed it produces bud

429
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:45,879
we harvest it it is over by taking a

430
00:14:43,389 --> 00:14:47,769
clone we can have that plant again and

431
00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:50,230
again then we can have repeatable

432
00:14:47,769 --> 00:14:52,539
reliable outcomes and a reliable product

433
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:55,240
from each harvest so a clone is

434
00:14:52,539 --> 00:14:57,129
basically a genetic photocopy of a

435
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:58,750
reliable plant in the form of just a

436
00:14:57,129 --> 00:15:01,000
tiny little plant and we'll talk about

437
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:03,220
clones and we'll talk about Fino hunting

438
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,259
a lot more as these grow lessons go on

439
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:08,889
now let's talk about some of the pros

440
00:15:05,259 --> 00:15:11,409
and cons of seeds and clone the pros of

441
00:15:08,889 --> 00:15:13,600
growing from seed one of the best parts

442
00:15:11,409 --> 00:15:16,750
about growing from seed is there are no

443
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:19,450
bugs and no pathogens you don't get free

444
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:21,639
powdery mildew with your new clone all

445
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:24,009
too often people give out clones that

446
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:26,980
are infested with spider mites with

447
00:15:24,009 --> 00:15:29,350
Russert mites with aphids with thrips or

448
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:32,320
with powdery mildew that is not an

449
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:34,330
option with the seed so let's also put

450
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,528
that in the cons category when it comes

451
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:37,509
to growing from clone

452
00:15:35,528 --> 00:15:39,938
one of the disadvantages of starting

453
00:15:37,509 --> 00:15:42,999
from clones is that they may come with

454
00:15:39,938 --> 00:15:44,649
bugs or pathogens now let's talk about

455
00:15:42,999 --> 00:15:47,620
one of my favorite parts about growing

456
00:15:44,649 --> 00:15:50,139
from seed growing from seed allows me to

457
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:52,480
find custom tailored phenotypes that

458
00:15:50,139 --> 00:15:54,698
work perfectly for what I'm looking for

459
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:57,519
medically and perfectly for what I'm

460
00:15:54,698 --> 00:15:59,799
looking for in my grow it grows the

461
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:01,839
height I want it to grow it grows for as

462
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:03,938
long as I want it to grow and it gives

463
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:06,970
me medicine it gives me the effect that

464
00:16:03,938 --> 00:16:08,948
I need so growing from seed allows me to

465
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:11,379
find something completely unique for

466
00:16:08,948 --> 00:16:14,588
myself that works perfectly for my

467
00:16:11,379 --> 00:16:16,839
garden and my medical needs the con to

468
00:16:14,589 --> 00:16:19,569
that is it does take time for a

469
00:16:16,839 --> 00:16:21,370
selection I have to run the batch of

470
00:16:19,568 --> 00:16:23,169
seeds I have to find the plant that

471
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:24,610
works for me hopefully there was one in

472
00:16:23,169 --> 00:16:25,149
that batch that was exactly what I

473
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:27,278
wanted

474
00:16:25,149 --> 00:16:29,379
if not I keep searching so that is the

475
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:31,568
downside to that and we will do an

476
00:16:29,379 --> 00:16:34,600
episode on Fino hunting in the future

477
00:16:31,568 --> 00:16:36,578
that is lined up in this series so one

478
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:38,949
of the advantages is that I can find

479
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:41,378
perfectly custom-tailored phenotypes

480
00:16:38,948 --> 00:16:43,899
that work for myself and my grow the con

481
00:16:41,379 --> 00:16:46,209
to that is that it does take time for a

482
00:16:43,899 --> 00:16:48,308
selection I have to run the seeds I have

483
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:50,349
to grow them up I have to cut clones I

484
00:16:48,308 --> 00:16:51,850
have to flower them out I have to dry

485
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:53,649
them cure them smoke them and see which

486
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:56,110
ones I enjoyed see which ones I didn't

487
00:16:53,649 --> 00:16:57,610
enjoy usually when I run a ten pack I

488
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:59,860
find two or three that I want to run

489
00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:02,409
again so I'll repeat the process and

490
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:04,720
eliminate it to one but that does take

491
00:17:02,409 --> 00:17:08,318
time money and energy to get to that

492
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:09,939
point also there may be males there may

493
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:13,000
be hermaphrodites and there may be

494
00:17:09,939 --> 00:17:15,130
undesirable phenotypes in that test run

495
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,779
so depending on the quality of the seeds

496
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:19,240
and the experience of the breeder and

497
00:17:16,779 --> 00:17:21,398
the stability of the work I may not find

498
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:23,439
the phenotype I'm looking for in a 10

499
00:17:21,398 --> 00:17:26,168
pack it may take more than ten seeds to

500
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:28,298
find the desirable phenotype but if I've

501
00:17:26,169 --> 00:17:30,460
got reliable seeds and the breeder did

502
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:32,408
his work and I've done my job properly I

503
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:34,690
may find something in there that is

504
00:17:32,409 --> 00:17:37,480
amazing and I may find something in

505
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:39,370
there that nobody else has which will

506
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:41,529
set me apart from the market if I'm

507
00:17:39,369 --> 00:17:43,869
growing for production to put on the

508
00:17:41,529 --> 00:17:46,119
street having a very unique strain would

509
00:17:43,869 --> 00:17:48,699
set me apart from the market if I've got

510
00:17:46,119 --> 00:17:50,079
the frosty astanga strain on the market

511
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,789
people are gonna want to buy that first

512
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:53,470
which means I'm gonna make more sales

513
00:17:51,789 --> 00:17:55,990
which means maybe I can charge a little

514
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:58,269
more so having that perfectly selected

515
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:59,140
phenotype that grows exactly the way I

516
00:17:58,269 --> 00:18:01,569
want it to

517
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:04,090
it grows perfectly for my grow and it

518
00:18:01,569 --> 00:18:06,159
works perfect for my area for my market

519
00:18:04,089 --> 00:18:08,769
that is a great advantage of growing

520
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,630
from seed another advantage of growing

521
00:18:08,769 --> 00:18:12,879
from seed is that there is a huge

522
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:14,890
variety available I know we talked about

523
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,840
this imaginary store where everything is

524
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:19,810
available but it's not like that in all

525
00:18:16,839 --> 00:18:22,359
places there are seed banks online that

526
00:18:19,809 --> 00:18:24,730
make many varieties of seeds from very

527
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:26,769
many reputable breeders available to

528
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:29,589
people all over the world so seed

529
00:18:26,769 --> 00:18:31,299
availability is a huge advantage not

530
00:18:29,589 --> 00:18:34,149
everybody can get their hands on clean

531
00:18:31,299 --> 00:18:35,769
reliable accurately labeled clones so

532
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:38,440
being able to order seeds from a seed

533
00:18:35,769 --> 00:18:41,230
bank is definitely advantageous now the

534
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:43,210
downside to that is seeds can be kind of

535
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:45,579
expensive depending on the vendor and

536
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:47,799
the breeder seeds can have a huge markup

537
00:18:45,579 --> 00:18:51,009
and if you're working with regular seeds

538
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:52,419
you may lose 60% of your crop right when

539
00:18:51,009 --> 00:18:54,160
you switch to flower because you're

540
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:56,710
going to have male plants to deal with

541
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:58,450
so buying seeds can get expensive

542
00:18:56,710 --> 00:19:00,910
and you also need to have a reliable

543
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:02,710
breeder and a reputable vendor so that

544
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:05,440
you know you are getting what you pay

545
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:07,450
for now let's focus more on growing from

546
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:10,029
clone what are some of the advantages or

547
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:12,400
pros of growing from a clone if properly

548
00:19:10,029 --> 00:19:15,910
selected that clone is a female if

549
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:17,890
properly selected that clone is known to

550
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:21,009
put out high potency and to grow without

551
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:23,050
any issues now that being said we have

552
00:19:21,009 --> 00:19:25,089
to rely on a grower so that is one of

553
00:19:23,049 --> 00:19:27,399
the cons of growing from clones

554
00:19:25,089 --> 00:19:29,019
somebody has to grow the seeds and find

555
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:31,780
the keeper plants out of those seed

556
00:19:29,019 --> 00:19:34,480
packages hopefully they chose the

557
00:19:31,779 --> 00:19:37,029
stellar keeper to pass on as clones to

558
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:39,099
the consumers in a dispensary what

559
00:19:37,029 --> 00:19:41,829
usually happens is I'll cut a hundred

560
00:19:39,099 --> 00:19:43,509
and twenty clones for my next run I only

561
00:19:41,829 --> 00:19:45,639
need a hundred of them so I actually

562
00:19:43,509 --> 00:19:47,319
send those twenty to the store so that I

563
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,730
don't have to throw them away we put

564
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:50,769
them on a manifest we send them to the

565
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:53,259
store and those are made available for

566
00:19:50,769 --> 00:19:55,150
shoppers in the retail store so if

567
00:19:53,259 --> 00:19:57,129
you're buying a clone from a dispensary

568
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:59,290
and it's accurately labeled you're

569
00:19:57,130 --> 00:20:01,270
probably getting the same exact cut as

570
00:19:59,289 --> 00:20:02,680
they're growing and putting on the Shelf

571
00:20:01,269 --> 00:20:04,569
so you know that those

572
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:06,549
clones have been properly Fino hunted

573
00:20:04,569 --> 00:20:08,889
you know that those clones are proven

574
00:20:06,549 --> 00:20:10,659
females with proven potency and have

575
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:13,090
proven themselves to be resistant to

576
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:14,710
bugs and pathogens so that's the

577
00:20:13,089 --> 00:20:16,869
advantage to growing from a clone the

578
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:18,340
disadvantage to that is who knows who

579
00:20:16,869 --> 00:20:20,439
selected that if you're just getting it

580
00:20:18,339 --> 00:20:23,019
from some dude on Craigslist who knows

581
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:25,330
how discerning his I was maybe his idea

582
00:20:23,019 --> 00:20:26,950
of amazing bud and you're the idea of

583
00:20:25,329 --> 00:20:29,500
amazing bud are two completely different

584
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:31,990
things so keep that in mind when working

585
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:34,150
with a clone another advantage of

586
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:35,859
working with a clone is we have an idea

587
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:38,140
of what to expect like we said before

588
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:40,240
somebody Fino hunted this clone they've

589
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:41,950
grown it out a couple of times they know

590
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,839
that it's a female they know that it's

591
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:47,470
gonna have high potency either high CBD

592
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:49,419
high THC or a beautiful ratio of both we

593
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:51,759
know what to expect we also have an idea

594
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:53,890
of what type of growth patterns to

595
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:56,079
expect is it gonna get real tall is it

596
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:57,910
gonna get real bushy is it gonna stretch

597
00:20:56,079 --> 00:21:00,339
out real bad is it gonna need a lot of

598
00:20:57,910 --> 00:21:02,860
water we also have a good idea of how

599
00:21:00,339 --> 00:21:04,779
long it will take to finish because our

600
00:21:02,859 --> 00:21:06,789
friends and partners have probably grown

601
00:21:04,779 --> 00:21:09,099
this cut several times before they gave

602
00:21:06,789 --> 00:21:10,990
it to us so the main advantage to

603
00:21:09,099 --> 00:21:12,789
growing from clone is that you've got a

604
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:14,799
proven female you don't have to worry

605
00:21:12,789 --> 00:21:17,019
about calling males every plant you put

606
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:18,460
in there is a female they've been tested

607
00:21:17,019 --> 00:21:20,500
for potency they've been tested for

608
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:23,110
vigor they've been tested for resistance

609
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:25,000
we know what to expect we know if we

610
00:21:23,109 --> 00:21:26,679
need sticks we know if we need trellis

611
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,660
we know how often to water it we know if

612
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:30,910
we can over feed it we know if it likes

613
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:33,310
a high or a low pH and we already know

614
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:35,259
how many days to let it flower so that

615
00:21:33,309 --> 00:21:37,629
is a huge advantage from working with a

616
00:21:35,259 --> 00:21:38,950
clone also you can always call the guy

617
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:40,750
and say hey bro this plant is doing

618
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:42,340
something weird have you ever seen this

619
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:43,869
strain do this and he'll say oh yeah man

620
00:21:42,339 --> 00:21:45,579
I drew that like ten times before I gave

621
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:48,039
it to you you probably just need more

622
00:21:45,579 --> 00:21:49,839
Cal mag so he's got some sort of history

623
00:21:48,039 --> 00:21:51,849
some sort of experience with it and he

624
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:54,159
can help you diagnose a problem if one

625
00:21:51,849 --> 00:21:56,500
does arise so that's a huge advantage of

626
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:59,110
working with a clone let's talk about

627
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:01,240
some of the disadvantages the number one

628
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:03,399
disadvantage the number one con to

629
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:05,890
bringing clones into your garden is most

630
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:09,519
of the time they are infested with bugs

631
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:11,680
and pathogens every grower likes to say

632
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:14,379
my grow is immaculate there is not a

633
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:16,450
single bug in my garden nine times out

634
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:18,610
of ten those guys are wrong the guy

635
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:20,650
that boast most about having the pest

636
00:22:18,609 --> 00:22:22,539
free garden are the ones that don't know

637
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:23,980
the pests are they're the guys that say

638
00:22:22,539 --> 00:22:25,329
no I've got a little bit of spider mites

639
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:27,250
they're the guys that are paying

640
00:22:25,329 --> 00:22:29,139
attention that are actually checking and

641
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:31,599
they know that those bugs are there they

642
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:33,340
are there so getting a clone you're

643
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:36,039
probably going to get some sort of a

644
00:22:33,339 --> 00:22:37,689
problem everybody also likes to say my

645
00:22:36,039 --> 00:22:38,829
buddy wouldn't give me clones with pests

646
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:40,750
on them yeah he doesn't even know

647
00:22:38,829 --> 00:22:42,490
they're there he didn't check he's not

648
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:44,440
paying enough attention he's just trying

649
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:46,089
to make five dollars a clone by selling

650
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:48,160
them to you he didn't care if you get

651
00:22:46,089 --> 00:22:50,559
spider mites or not because you're gonna

652
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:53,200
need more clones in the future either

653
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:55,539
way so the downside to clones is they

654
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,880
come with free bugs quite often you get

655
00:22:55,539 --> 00:22:59,440
spider mites you get free route a feeds

656
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,910
you get free white flies you get free

657
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,759
fungus gnats and if you're really lucky

658
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:06,400
sometimes you even get free powdery

659
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:08,470
mildew with your new clones another

660
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:11,170
disadvantage to growing from clone is

661
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:12,970
everybody already has it if you're just

662
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:14,560
growing this strain for yourself for

663
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:16,029
your medical needs or for a loved ones

664
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:18,490
medical needs and that strain works

665
00:23:16,029 --> 00:23:20,619
perfectly for you that is great but if

666
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:23,349
you were growing for a market reason and

667
00:23:20,619 --> 00:23:25,029
everybody has that strain you're going

668
00:23:23,349 --> 00:23:26,859
to have to be a better grower than

669
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:29,049
everybody else growing it to make your

670
00:23:26,859 --> 00:23:30,789
product stand out otherwise you're just

671
00:23:29,049 --> 00:23:32,619
another guy selling weed on the black

672
00:23:30,789 --> 00:23:34,960
market if you don't have a standout

673
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:36,489
strain you will blend in just like

674
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,079
everybody else so if you're growing the

675
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:40,660
same clone that all of your competition

676
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:42,579
is growing you've really got to be the

677
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:44,259
best grower so that's one of the

678
00:23:42,579 --> 00:23:46,509
downsides to growing from clone is

679
00:23:44,259 --> 00:23:48,309
everybody's got it and you guys that's

680
00:23:46,509 --> 00:23:49,960
why some growers are tight with their

681
00:23:48,309 --> 00:23:52,539
genetics that's why some guys won't let

682
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:54,340
clones out because they're the only one

683
00:23:52,539 --> 00:23:56,799
growing that specific strain in that

684
00:23:54,339 --> 00:23:59,049
area if you want that you've got to go

685
00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:01,450
to them they've always got some income

686
00:23:59,049 --> 00:24:03,159
because their product stands out now

687
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:06,970
another downside to working with clones

688
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:08,529
is they can get expensive and something

689
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:10,630
in me says that you get what you pay for

690
00:24:08,529 --> 00:24:12,129
when it comes to clones if you're going

691
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:14,230
to Craigslist and paying three to five

692
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:16,240
dollars for a clone you're going to get

693
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:18,009
a three to five dollar clone it may be

694
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,960
quality genetics it may be what you're

695
00:24:18,009 --> 00:24:22,089
looking for but how healthy is it how

696
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:24,730
good of a start did it get how many bugs

697
00:24:22,089 --> 00:24:26,230
does it have clones can get expensive

698
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:29,620
the clones that I saw at the dispensary

699
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:30,009
recently or in 4x4 cubes of cocoa the

700
00:24:29,619 --> 00:24:31,839
clone

701
00:24:30,009 --> 00:24:34,750
were about six or eight inches tall they

702
00:24:31,839 --> 00:24:36,669
looked super healthy they were $40 if

703
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:38,710
you're trying to buy six of those that's

704
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:40,630
gonna add up really quickly can you

705
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:42,610
throw down two hundred and forty dollars

706
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:45,010
every time you want to start afresh grow

707
00:24:42,609 --> 00:24:47,500
a package of seeds is way cheaper than

708
00:24:45,009 --> 00:24:48,910
that but you have to do the work you

709
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:50,319
have to grow them you have to find the

710
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:52,750
males and you have to find the keeper

711
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:55,210
the advantage with clone is somebody has

712
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:57,519
already done all of that work for you so

713
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:59,500
they can charge you 40 bucks so one of

714
00:24:57,519 --> 00:25:02,619
the disadvantages to growing from clone

715
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:04,390
is that they are expensive unless you're

716
00:25:02,619 --> 00:25:06,969
getting them from a friend they can add

717
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:08,830
up and cost quite quickly you guys I've

718
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:09,730
seen clones go from anywhere from 5 or

719
00:25:08,829 --> 00:25:11,710
10 bucks

720
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:13,720
I saw those clones at the dispensary the

721
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:15,970
other day they had a purple punch and a

722
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:18,819
doe see does there were $40 each

723
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:21,430
it is not uncommon for me to see a clone

724
00:25:18,819 --> 00:25:23,679
sell for the 500 to 1,000 dollar range

725
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:25,840
and there are stories of certain cuts

726
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:28,060
being sold for ten to twenty five

727
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:29,649
thousand dollars depending on what

728
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:32,079
strain we're talking about there are

729
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:33,519
rumors of astronomical numbers but I

730
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:35,139
don't know how much of that is true but

731
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:37,210
some of the people in the bay have paid

732
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:38,980
ridiculous prices for some of the og

733
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:41,590
pushes and some of the more well-known

734
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:43,870
strains that the rapper's rap about some

735
00:25:41,589 --> 00:25:45,549
of the OG Kush and cookie crosses went

736
00:25:43,869 --> 00:25:47,500
for big money when they first hit the

737
00:25:45,549 --> 00:25:50,409
market and people have built entire

738
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:53,140
empires and businesses off of those cuts

739
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:55,600
so clones can get quite expensive quite

740
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:58,210
quickly another disadvantage to clones

741
00:25:55,599 --> 00:26:00,309
is are they available does anybody in

742
00:25:58,210 --> 00:26:02,319
your area have clones does anybody you

743
00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:04,690
trust have clones available and if you

744
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:06,730
do get clones are they accurately

745
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:09,190
labeled ask your friends what clones

746
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:11,259
they have don't ask for a specific

747
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:12,970
strain because if you ask for wedding

748
00:26:11,259 --> 00:26:15,069
cake now your friend suddenly has

749
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:16,809
wedding cake and he needs big money for

750
00:26:15,069 --> 00:26:18,970
it if you ask what strains he's got

751
00:26:16,809 --> 00:26:21,099
available he'll give you a list select

752
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:22,870
from there don't give them the option to

753
00:26:21,099 --> 00:26:24,399
invent a name or slap a label on

754
00:26:22,869 --> 00:26:26,139
something just because you're willing to

755
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:29,110
throw some money their direction for

756
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:31,570
that cut so that is my quick debate on

757
00:26:29,109 --> 00:26:33,519
seed versus clone we'll go over it

758
00:26:31,569 --> 00:26:36,519
really quickly again and recap the pros

759
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:37,960
of growing from seed no bugs no pests no

760
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:39,639
problems you don't start off with

761
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:41,769
somebody else's problems in your grow

762
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:43,929
another advantage is that you can select

763
00:26:41,769 --> 00:26:47,138
perfectly selected phenotypes

764
00:26:43,929 --> 00:26:49,059
work for you and your grow also nobody

765
00:26:47,138 --> 00:26:52,359
else is going to have your phenotype

766
00:26:49,058 --> 00:26:54,579
which will give you better market value

767
00:26:52,359 --> 00:26:56,109
some of the cons of growing from seed is

768
00:26:54,579 --> 00:26:58,480
that it takes time

769
00:26:56,109 --> 00:27:00,758
for selection you have to grow them and

770
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:03,339
find out what you've got select a keeper

771
00:27:00,759 --> 00:27:05,528
and then grow from there you will also

772
00:27:03,339 --> 00:27:08,259
need to call males and undesirable

773
00:27:05,528 --> 00:27:10,808
phenotypes they're also a little bit

774
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:13,538
expensive also is the strain you want

775
00:27:10,808 --> 00:27:15,460
available in seed form some of the older

776
00:27:13,538 --> 00:27:17,470
stuff may not be available anymore

777
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:19,659
because breeders are always evolving and

778
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:21,249
creating new stock another thing you

779
00:27:19,659 --> 00:27:23,440
have to think about is are the seeds

780
00:27:21,249 --> 00:27:25,569
accurately labeled are you being sold

781
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,548
what you're paying for now let's talk

782
00:27:25,569 --> 00:27:30,428
about clones really quickly again the

783
00:27:27,548 --> 00:27:31,898
pros you have got proven potent females

784
00:27:30,429 --> 00:27:33,159
you know what you've got you know what

785
00:27:31,898 --> 00:27:35,918
you're working with you know what to

786
00:27:33,159 --> 00:27:37,809
expect you know what to plan for some of

787
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:39,759
the downsides to working with clones are

788
00:27:37,808 --> 00:27:41,950
you get those bugs you get those

789
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:44,139
pathogens you get free problems also

790
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:45,639
everybody else in the area has it

791
00:27:44,138 --> 00:27:46,959
everybody else is already growing it

792
00:27:45,638 --> 00:27:48,638
there's nothing different there's

793
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:52,509
nothing exciting about it unless it's

794
00:27:48,638 --> 00:27:54,638
custom for you also our clones available

795
00:27:52,509 --> 00:27:56,230
can you even get clones do you trust the

796
00:27:54,638 --> 00:27:58,898
people you have to deal with to get them

797
00:27:56,230 --> 00:28:01,269
and are they accurately labeled when you

798
00:27:58,898 --> 00:28:04,118
do get them that is my quick friendly

799
00:28:01,269 --> 00:28:05,919
unbiased debate on seeds versus clones

800
00:28:04,118 --> 00:28:07,628
of course being a breeder I want you to

801
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:10,778
buy seeds and I want you to buy them at

802
00:28:07,628 --> 00:28:12,459
dank seed dot store then I want you to

803
00:28:10,778 --> 00:28:13,929
do a phenol hunt and find the one that

804
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:15,850
works best for you we will talk about

805
00:28:13,929 --> 00:28:17,740
phenol hunting in the future we will

806
00:28:15,849 --> 00:28:19,509
also talk about cutting our own clones

807
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:21,669
in the future that way once you've

808
00:28:19,509 --> 00:28:23,499
acquired clones or seeds you can do a

809
00:28:21,669 --> 00:28:25,330
phenol hunt you can select the keeper

810
00:28:23,499 --> 00:28:27,308
then we can cut clones off of that

811
00:28:25,329 --> 00:28:29,589
keeper and we can be self-sustainable

812
00:28:27,308 --> 00:28:31,720
and not have to acquire genetic material

813
00:28:29,589 --> 00:28:33,788
from other sources unless we decide to

814
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:35,288
add something new to the grow so we'll

815
00:28:33,788 --> 00:28:36,849
talk about phenol hunting we'll talk

816
00:28:35,288 --> 00:28:39,398
about cloning we'll talk about mother
