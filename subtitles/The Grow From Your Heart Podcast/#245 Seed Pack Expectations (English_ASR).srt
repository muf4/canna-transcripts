ladies and gentlemen you will not hear

22
00:00:54,369 --> 00:00:58,929
me bitching about the heat in Colorado

23
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:00,370
for quite some time it's right it's

24
00:00:58,929 --> 00:01:02,320
starting to cool off this morning it was

25
00:01:00,369 --> 00:01:03,939
nice and chilly and this evening it's

26
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,159
getting a little bit cold I had to close

27
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:08,289
the windows I've had the swamp cooler an

28
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,000
air conditioner running every day until

29
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:11,800
yesterday or the day before it is

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,840
starting to cool off here in Colorado I

31
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:15,099
think I'm looking forward to the cool I

32
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,329
don't have to run as much air

33
00:01:15,099 --> 00:01:18,759
conditioning you can run a few more

34
00:01:16,329 --> 00:01:20,349
lights things get a little bit easier

35
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:21,939
some things get a little bit easier in

36
00:01:20,349 --> 00:01:23,530
the cool driving sucks in the snow

37
00:01:21,939 --> 00:01:24,879
that's the least favorite part getting

38
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:26,500
to and from work in the snow is kind of

39
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:28,989
a [ __ ] but I'm looking forward to the

40
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:30,368
fall winter season this year

41
00:01:28,989 --> 00:01:32,500
you won't hear me complain about the Sun

42
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:33,599
and the heat at all for a few months

43
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,709
what you will hear me complain about

44
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:38,649

45

about her a lot on the podcast cuz it's

83
00:02:48,939 --> 00:02:51,819

84
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:53,230

85
00:02:51,819 --> 00:02:55,629
beautiful girlfriend Jenny Beth to the

86
00:02:53,229 --> 00:02:57,099
Denver Zoo on Sunday and we got to go

87
00:02:55,629 --> 00:02:58,469

88
00:02:57,099 --> 00:03:00,479

some Tigers we saw some bears oh my it's

91
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,950

00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:07,979
good time

93
00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:09,449
we all had a bunch of fun we are some

94
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:11,729
twisted individuals I think we had more

95
00:03:09,449 --> 00:03:13,769
fun making fun of the silly humans than

96
00:03:11,729 --> 00:03:15,840
we actually had checking out the animals

97
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:17,219
at the zoo but that's just the type of

98
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,349
folks we are it was a good-ass time

99

girlfriend and I

103
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:26,099

104
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,920

105

and fishes and other stuff of that

110
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:39,960
nature one thing at the Denver Zoo that

111
00:03:38,069 --> 00:03:43,169
kind of tripped me out they are doing

112
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:44,340
zoo dinosaurs so occasionally you'll be

113
00:03:43,169 --> 00:03:47,039
walking through the zoo and you'll hear

114
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:48,180
a roar a roar that confuses you if you

115
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:49,379
don't know there are dinosaurs at the

116
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:51,450
zoo this week because that's like what

117
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:53,189
the [ __ ] animal is that because it was

118
00:03:51,449 --> 00:03:54,389
intense it was loud it was really Basie

119
00:03:53,189 --> 00:03:56,310
and I could hear it from a long ways

120
00:03:54,389 --> 00:03:59,489
away it was not a real animal it was a

121
00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:00,750
dinosaur no people are going dinosaurs

122
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:02,070
what the [ __ ] that's what I said too

123
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:03,449
they're not real dinosaurs you guys

124
00:04:02,069 --> 00:04:05,159
they're animatronic they will not hurt

125
00:04:03,449 --> 00:04:06,689
you they are peaceful there are robots

126
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:09,870
there did you toll ah

127
00:04:06,689 --> 00:04:11,099
but man how is that gonna confuse some

128
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:12,900
little kids because we're teaching

129
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:14,159
little kids at the dinosaurs burg years

130
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,480
ago and then they're gonna go to the zoo

131
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,620
and I gonna see dinosaurs maybe what the

132
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:18,358
[ __ ] all the books are lying

133
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:20,160
I got damn seen dinosaurs at the zoo

134
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:21,629
last week it's gonna be weird someone's

135
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,560
gonna go to school some little kids

136
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:23,519
gonna go to school they're gonna start

137
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,290
at school nothing big I thought

138
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:26,310
dinosaurs really no you didn't they make

139
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:28,590
[ __ ] you yes I did

140
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:30,149
it's gonna be weird there's dinosaurs at

141
00:04:28,589 --> 00:04:31,649
the Denver Zoo you guys I thought it was

142
00:04:30,149 --> 00:04:33,689
weird is that confusing the kids I

143
00:04:31,649 --> 00:04:37,139
really don't know really don't know

144
00:04:33,689 --> 00:04:39,329
alright so after the zoo I took my

145
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:40,918
beautiful daughter home and the lovely

146
00:04:39,329 --> 00:04:43,019
always lovely always beautiful Jenny

147
00:04:40,918 --> 00:04:45,689
Beth and I we got to go to servantes

148
00:04:43,019 --> 00:04:47,250
other side and to see what I think is my

149
00:04:45,689 --> 00:04:48,689
favorite reggae band I've called them my

150
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:50,399
favorite reggae man enough times that I

151
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:52,560
think I believe it I got to go see

152
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:55,560
Morgan heritage at servantes other side

153
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,030
in Denver I was a pretty good show we

154
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,918
showed up fairly early we got to see the

155
00:04:57,029 --> 00:05:01,619
opening act they were called red sage

156
00:04:58,918 --> 00:05:03,418
they were good but I don't know that

157
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:05,340
they were the appropriate opening act

158
00:05:03,418 --> 00:05:08,099
for Morgan heritage they were a little

159
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:10,289
more like fortunate youth more on the

160
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:11,640
blaim side of things I kind of would

161
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:14,310
have fit in with the mystic roots band

162
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:16,289
not quite the roots rock reggae sort of

163
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:17,970
thing that you should have had opening

164
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:19,860
for Morgan heritage in my opinion but

165
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:21,410
hey it brought a different crowd more

166
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:24,420
people came that was cool

167
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:26,100
so Morgan heritage came on stage and

168
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:28,020
Jenny Beth and I walked directly to the

169
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:30,870
front of the stage the stage is about

170
00:05:28,019 --> 00:05:32,639
waist-high Jenny Beth was directly in

171
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:34,230
front of the stage right behind her was

172
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,479
me protecting her from all the other

173
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:37,800
idiots up front there's something weird

174
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,720
that happens late at night when people

175
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,009
are up front at a concert you just see

176
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,450
everybody get this glazed look on their

177
00:05:41,009 --> 00:05:44,250
face once the drugs and alcohol start

178
00:05:42,449 --> 00:05:45,539
kicking in and they just go full [ __ ]

179
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:47,279
they think they can ram into you and

180
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:49,379
bump into you and push you over and it's

181
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:52,349
ridiculous and being six five and having

182
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:54,269
dreadlocks to my ass I can make it clear

183
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:55,500
to the drunk people that the space I am

184
00:05:54,269 --> 00:05:57,569
standing in and the space I am

185
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:59,610
protecting for my girlfriend that is my

186
00:05:57,569 --> 00:06:01,439
space and I will not move we're going to

187
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:03,030
hold our ground so you have to spend a

188
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:04,230
little bit of your time kind of claiming

189
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,459
your space and putting your elbows up

190
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,990
occasionally because people get a little

191
00:06:05,459 --> 00:06:09,000
bit ridiculous but we had a great time I

192
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:10,829
protected the miss the always beautiful

193
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,060
always lovely miss Jenny Beth protected

194
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:13,889
her pretty well from the drunken idiots

195
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:16,139
she didn't get plowed into too much we

196
00:06:13,889 --> 00:06:18,089
got to see the band up front it was such

197
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:20,519
a great show we were so close that I

198
00:06:18,089 --> 00:06:22,199
could hear Peter Morgan's voice coming

199
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:24,389
out of him before it hit the microphone

200
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:27,629
and before it went into the sound system

201
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:29,669
and that man has an amazing [ __ ]

202
00:06:27,629 --> 00:06:32,699
voice Peter Morgan from organ heritage

203
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:34,350
is one of my favorite vocalists ever the

204
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:36,810
dude's got mad style the dude's got mad

205
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:38,939
flow his voice is awesome he's got a

206
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:41,430
good vibe I just liked the way that dude

207
00:06:38,939 --> 00:06:43,620
performs his brother Gramps Morgan off

208
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:46,050
to the right side of him my right of him

209
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:48,030
had B his left I guess mr. Gramps Morgan

210
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:50,069
I could hear him sing that dude's got a

211
00:06:48,029 --> 00:06:51,569
deep rich voice he's got a big

212
00:06:50,069 --> 00:06:53,639
infectious smile he just looks like a

213
00:06:51,569 --> 00:06:55,860
big Jamaican teddy bear I just looks

214
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:57,089
like such a cool dude ah then mojo

215
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:59,790
Morgan on the other side of the stage

216
00:06:57,089 --> 00:07:01,709
plays percussion he raps a few times

217
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:04,140
that dude's just always got the biggest

218
00:07:01,709 --> 00:07:05,609
cheesiest smile on his face he doesn't

219
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:07,409
sing a whole lot he's more kind of a

220
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:08,759
kind of a rapper sort of a dude he does

221
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:10,530
his own little raps in parts of the

222
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:12,180
songs but I could hear these guys's

223
00:07:10,529 --> 00:07:14,069
voices before they were hitting the

224
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:16,319
microphones and their harmonies together

225
00:07:14,069 --> 00:07:17,728
their voices individually these guys

226
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,300
have some [ __ ] talent you guys they

227
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:23,240
got the richest voices

228
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:25,129
heard in a long time at a great time so

229
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:27,228
Sunday we see Morgan heritage we drive

230
00:07:25,129 --> 00:07:29,810
back to Pueblo Monday I go to work kind

231
00:07:27,228 --> 00:07:30,978
of dragon ass because Sunday was a long

232
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:32,209
[ __ ] night we didn't get home till

233
00:07:30,978 --> 00:07:34,128
super late we didn't get to bed till

234
00:07:32,209 --> 00:07:36,769
even later had to get up had to go to

235
00:07:34,129 --> 00:07:37,789
the grow it did that might have been a

236
00:07:36,769 --> 00:07:39,740
little silly might have been a little

237
00:07:37,788 --> 00:07:41,839
bit loopy but I made the best of it got

238
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:45,259
some rest then on Tuesday I went to work

239
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:46,609
again after work came to the house and

240
00:07:45,259 --> 00:07:48,169
got cleaned up a little bit and met up

241
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:49,610
with the always lovely always beautiful

242
00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:51,258
miss Jenny Beth and her and I headed up

243
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:55,129
to Colorado Springs to the black sheep

244
00:07:51,259 --> 00:07:58,158
to see Morgan heritage once again it was

245
00:07:55,129 --> 00:08:00,110
a great show on Sunday um the opening

246
00:07:58,158 --> 00:08:02,139
act once again was a great opening act

247
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:05,090
I cannot remember their name right now

248
00:08:02,139 --> 00:08:07,759
project two three four project three two

249
00:08:05,089 --> 00:08:09,318
four project four two three project and

250
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,310
the numbers ahead two three and four but

251
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:12,348
they were not in the correct order

252
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:14,060
project three to four is what I want to

253
00:08:12,348 --> 00:08:15,918
call him not certain but project

254
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:17,750
something they were a good band I really

255
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:20,089
liked their style their drummer played

256
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:22,038
some really great fills other guitar

257
00:08:20,089 --> 00:08:23,989
player was [ __ ] talented their bass

258
00:08:22,038 --> 00:08:25,459
player held it down and the other guitar

259
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:27,199
player the rhythm guy man there were

260
00:08:25,459 --> 00:08:30,228
he's played some really nice rhythms

261
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,848
with like really nice lead parts mixed

262
00:08:30,228 --> 00:08:34,399
into the rhythms is really cool that

263
00:08:31,848 --> 00:08:36,019
band was really cool maybe once again

264
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,389
not the appropriate opener from organ

265
00:08:36,019 --> 00:08:39,620
heritage but music is music man if you

266
00:08:38,389 --> 00:08:41,328
got an opening act to start the party

267
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:43,639
let's do it I think they were great

268
00:08:41,328 --> 00:08:45,229
Morgan heritage came on stage and I

269
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:47,059
headed directly to the front of the

270
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:48,589
venue Jenny Beth and I were directly in

271
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:50,929
front of Peter Morgan once again all

272
00:08:48,589 --> 00:08:52,130
night it was a great show you know in

273
00:08:50,929 --> 00:08:53,870
the first night there were about eighty

274
00:08:52,129 --> 00:08:56,838
to a hundred people in the venue I would

275
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:58,070
estimate and on the sunday show or on

276
00:08:56,839 --> 00:09:00,410
the Tuesday show at the black sheep

277
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:02,810
there were maybe 25 or 30 people at the

278
00:09:00,409 --> 00:09:04,639
show and the band still gave it their

279
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:07,338
all they still performed like they were

280
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:08,838
at reggae Sunsplash they performed like

281
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:10,760
they were at reggae on the river they

282
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:11,839
gave their full big show just like they

283
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:14,179
normally would

284
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:16,040
they played mostly the same set on both

285
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:18,229
nights with a couple of variations they

286
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:20,599
switched out a couple of songs I was

287
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:22,550
really happy to hear Moscow Square on

288
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:24,110
Tuesday that's just a good song it's

289
00:09:22,549 --> 00:09:26,269
from one of their older albums which I

290
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:27,769
really love they did not play what we

291
00:09:26,269 --> 00:09:29,089
need is love on the second show but they

292
00:09:27,769 --> 00:09:31,490
did on the first show which came from

293
00:09:29,089 --> 00:09:33,740
from the my favorite album of theirs

294
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:34,389
called more teachings the both those

295
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,129
songs came from

296
00:09:34,389 --> 00:09:37,779
that one they opened both nights with

297
00:09:36,129 --> 00:09:41,529
strictly routes they closed both nights

298
00:09:37,779 --> 00:09:44,139
with reggae night ah they do she's still

299
00:09:41,529 --> 00:09:45,730
loving me they do a big do Cielo of

300
00:09:44,139 --> 00:09:46,870
course and a bunch of great songs in the

301
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:49,090
middle but there weren't very many

302
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:50,500
people there at the Tuesday show I was a

303
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:52,330
great show we were upfront once again

304
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:54,490
and there was a moment when the reverb

305
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:56,530
was so loud that I couldn't figure out

306
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:58,419
what was going on the singer would sing

307
00:09:56,529 --> 00:10:00,669
into the microphone and then it would

308
00:09:58,419 --> 00:10:03,399
take like this long fruit so he would be

309
00:10:00,669 --> 00:10:04,870
like here is my lyric and then you hear

310
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:07,659
this much delay and then we go here is

311
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:09,850
my lyric here is my lyric here is my

312
00:10:07,659 --> 00:10:11,379
lyric so he couldn't even I could tell

313
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:12,610
he was becoming frustrated by all the

314
00:10:11,379 --> 00:10:15,100
reverb he couldn't hear himself I

315
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:18,159
couldn't hear him but we were so close

316
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:19,930
that I was hearing we're I was hearing

317
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:21,159
the stage sound in front of me and then

318
00:10:19,929 --> 00:10:22,539
the house sound behind me and all the

319
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:25,059
sound was mixing it was really odd I

320
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:26,679
would have been better to back up about

321
00:10:25,059 --> 00:10:28,959
10 feet just because of the sound of

322
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:30,969
that venue but I was so close that I

323
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:33,070
could hear feel and see the drums coming

324
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:34,660
off of the drums hear the sound coming

325
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:36,580
off the drums before they went through

326
00:10:34,659 --> 00:10:38,019
the speakers and I was loving that I was

327
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:40,120
hearing the tone of those drums and just

328
00:10:38,019 --> 00:10:42,189
watching that drummer I do not know the

329
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:44,740
drummer from organ Heritage's name if

330
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:47,140
that dude is bad ass I'm pretty sure the

331
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:50,110
bass player from organ heritage is a

332
00:10:47,139 --> 00:10:52,000
toots Hibbert son or grandson he's young

333
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:54,039
so I'm gonna say grandson these kids the

334
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,230
basin drummer looks like 19 and 20 years

335
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:58,120
old those guys are barely 21 if they're

336
00:10:56,230 --> 00:11:00,039
21 there's some young cats and that

337
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:02,679
rhythm section [ __ ] held it down and

338
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:04,389
tore it up those guys were great well

339
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:06,599
Morgan heritage has a new backup singer

340
00:11:04,389 --> 00:11:09,699
they have a lady in the band a sister

341
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:11,590
Asuna morgan who i don't know why but

342
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:13,810
she has left the band I would assume

343
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:15,250
that it's a health reason I cannot be

344
00:11:13,809 --> 00:11:16,359
positive I'm assuming it's a health

345
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:18,490
reason just from things I've observed

346
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:20,230
but una hasn't been with the band for

347
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:21,519
the past couple of tours that I've gone

348
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:23,170
to I see this man two or three times a

349
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,909
year she hasn't been on tour with them

350
00:11:23,169 --> 00:11:26,439
for at least the past two years I don't

351
00:11:24,909 --> 00:11:28,959
know if Jenny Beth has ever seen them

352
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:30,250
with una which kind of gives me an

353
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:32,259
indicator of how long she's been gone

354
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:34,330
but they have another backup singer

355
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:36,069
named Natasha who seemed a little bit

356
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:37,960
shy at first but once she gets in the

357
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:39,160
groove the girl really gets in the

358
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,450
groove and she's got a hell of a voice

359
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:42,610
so if you ever hear this you're doing a

360
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:43,150
great job don't be so shy I like what

361
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:44,830
you're doing

362
00:11:43,149 --> 00:11:46,209
alright guys I saw Morgan heritage

363
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:47,740
that's my point I saw them twice and it

364
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:48,759
was [ __ ] amazing

365
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:50,649
if you ever get to listen to morgan

366
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:51,879
heritage i recommend it go for some of

367
00:11:50,649 --> 00:11:54,069
the older stuff go for the more

368
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:56,590

369

395
00:12:41,889 --> 00:12:45,549
attitude adjustment it's like a mood

396
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,720
shifter sometimes a guy that works too

397
00:12:45,549 --> 00:12:48,789
hard and gets frustrated with the world

398
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,610
can use a little bit of an attitude

399
00:12:48,789 --> 00:12:53,799
adjustment alright let's move forward

400
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:56,680
you guys episode number 250 is coming

401
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:58,659
holy crap I'm five episodes away from

402
00:12:56,679 --> 00:13:00,459
episode number 250 honestly when I

403
00:12:58,659 --> 00:13:01,809
started this podcast I was like I'd like

404
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:03,639
to get a hundred episodes under my belt

405
00:13:01,809 --> 00:13:04,750
and then once I got like 50 episodes in

406
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:07,360
I was like [ __ ] I'm going for at least

407
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:09,009
250 episodes I'm almost at 250 you guys

408
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,840
let me tell you the truth I have no

409
00:13:09,009 --> 00:13:13,090
intentions of ever stopping this podcast

410
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:15,040
I'm gonna do this as long as I can I

411
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:16,660
love doing this sometimes it's a [ __ ]

412
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:18,309
struggle to get behind a microphone and

413
00:13:16,659 --> 00:13:19,990
spit out an hour or thirty minutes of

414
00:13:18,309 --> 00:13:21,789
material every week I have to find the

415
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:23,889
time to organize the show I got to do it

416
00:13:21,789 --> 00:13:25,120
I gotta sit here and talk it but you

417
00:13:23,889 --> 00:13:27,100
know what I'm never gonna stop doing it

418
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,320
because I love doing it I love sharing

419
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:30,220
part of me with you guys I love helping

420
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:33,100
you with cannabis

421
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:36,340
I love getting cannabis freed up I think

422
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:38,019
we are I think I am dispelling myths

423
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:39,580
about cannabis I'm breaking the truth to

424
00:13:38,019 --> 00:13:41,860
people I'm taking the fear out of

425
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:43,120
cannabis I'm teaching people to take

426
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:44,889
better care of their gardens and

427
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,810
themselves by talking about cannabis

428
00:13:44,889 --> 00:13:48,610
maybe I'm helping people fight cancer

429
00:13:46,809 --> 00:13:50,649
maybe I'm helping people take care of a

430
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:52,269
family member who is sick I love doing

431
00:13:50,649 --> 00:13:54,159
this podcast because I know that every

432
00:13:52,269 --> 00:13:55,929
episode I put out I hope at least one

433
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:57,669
person and if I'm just helping one

434
00:13:55,929 --> 00:13:59,439
person with every episode it makes it

435
00:13:57,669 --> 00:14:01,000
well worth my time and energy I feel

436
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,190
like I would be doing the world

437
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,960
myself a disservice by not sharing all

438
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:07,210
of the [ __ ] that I have learned with

439
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:09,280
people I've absorbed a lot and I've got

440
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:10,570
a good brain and I like to talk a lot

441
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:12,759
and I feel like it's kind of my

442
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:14,590
responsibility to put this out here for

443
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:16,210
you guys I love you guys I love cannabis

444
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:17,950
I love talking ass off

445
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:19,900
I love podcasting there's no reason for

446
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:22,060
me to quit doing this so I guess the new

447
00:14:19,899 --> 00:14:25,569
goal I'm gonna say 500 episodes that's

448
00:14:22,059 --> 00:14:26,799
kind of that's 250 more so let's say 500

449
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:28,990
and when I hit that we're gonna aim for

450
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:30,339
a thousand [ __ ] 750 I don't even like

451
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:30,789
that number that's just like a give up

452
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:32,950
number

453
00:14:30,789 --> 00:14:34,480
you gotta get to a thousand Joe Rogan

454
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:36,220
made it to a thousand if Joe Rogan can

455
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,539
do it I can definitely do it then dude

456
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:39,370

457

00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:10,720
listeners not sure if you were referring

489
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:12,820
to my email but I went back and read my

490
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,740
email I sent and I wanted to clarify a

491
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:16,360
few things I said I've been inspected

492
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:18,759
and consulted that sounded a bit

493
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:22,000
pretentious what I meant was I've passed

494
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:23,200
out a lot of info forward the people I

495
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,639
have helped come from the old Southern

496
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,740
school of thought that if it ain't broke

497
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,779
don't fix it these individuals are good

498
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:31,210
simple living people just trying to

499
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:33,309
avoid the trap life hustle I've helped

500
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:34,960
with bug helped with bug and efficiency

501
00:16:33,309 --> 00:16:37,119
problems such as corn worms cow egg

502
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:39,370
deficiency salt lock in mother plants

503
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,750
hot zones and flour rooms different

504
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:41,710
plant training techniques and he keeps

505
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,360
going for a little while

506
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:46,030
anyway I wanted to read this guy's email

507
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,800
he says most of the info I have has come

508
00:16:46,029 --> 00:16:49,809
from you sub cool and my book collection

509
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:51,819
due to forget an info from myself and

510
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:53,529
sub cool and good books you were off to

511
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:55,600
a great start he goes on to say I listen

512
00:16:53,529 --> 00:16:58,659
to 10 plus hours of podcasts and ebooks

513
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:01,060
a day as I slave away at my structural

514
00:16:58,659 --> 00:17:03,519
structural that's harder to say than it

515
00:17:01,059 --> 00:17:05,980
looks structural steel fabrication job

516
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:08,079
so I have a lot of info and just want to

517
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:09,730
pass it forward I don't want to get into

518
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:11,139
the industry for the money but for a

519
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:13,240
better future for my family and most

520
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:15,160
importantly I feel the need to be part

521
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:17,289
of the movement to keep corporate

522
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:21,400
America from taking what so many before

523
00:17:17,289 --> 00:17:22,450
us have sacrificed to give us that's a

524
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,890
good reason to want to get into it

525
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:26,830
because that corporate takeover is

526
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:28,480
happening it's becoming that way it's a

527
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:29,720
corporate industry now it's happening

528
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,788
quickly

529
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:34,279

I read a lot of emails that start off

560
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:29,690
like that and every time it means a lot

561
00:18:28,308 --> 00:18:31,308
to me I put a lot of effort into this

562
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:34,548
show takes a lot of time a lot of energy

563
00:18:31,308 --> 00:18:36,529
so I do appreciate every compliment he

564
00:18:34,548 --> 00:18:38,210
goes on to say or maybe she goes on to

565
00:18:36,529 --> 00:18:38,899
say you are incredibly knowledgeable and

566
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:41,690
well-spoken

567
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:43,490
it is a goldmine for newbies like me I'm

568
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:45,320
glad you found me I'm glad I can help

569
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:47,480
you out the email continues to say my

570
00:18:45,319 --> 00:18:49,369
main question is for someone like me who

571
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:52,009
isn't in a legal state what is my best

572
00:18:49,369 --> 00:18:53,509
bet on getting high quality seeds I've

573
00:18:52,009 --> 00:18:55,970
been doing a lot of research and

574
00:18:53,509 --> 00:18:58,400
wondering about going with US banks or

575
00:18:55,970 --> 00:19:01,250
an overseas one it goes without saying

576
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:03,259
that my main concern is discreteness I

577
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:04,849
think you met discretion but hey we'll

578
00:19:03,259 --> 00:19:06,740
let you fly with quality and

579
00:19:04,849 --> 00:19:08,689
dependability coming in right behind any

580
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:10,640
info or suggestions on this subject or

581
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:12,590
just tips for the beginners you can help

582
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,049
me out with would be greatly appreciated

583
00:19:12,589 --> 00:19:16,788
you're the man hey yeah thanks for

584
00:19:15,048 --> 00:19:17,779
trusting me ah because I've got some

585
00:19:16,788 --> 00:19:19,490
info for you that you're going to

586
00:19:17,779 --> 00:19:20,690
appreciate but the email keeps going it

587
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:23,000
says all so I just wanted to let you

588
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:25,250
know how I feel like we have become

589
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,319
buddies just from the short month I've

590
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:29,359
been listening to you being pretty

591
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:31,158
engulfed in stand-up comedy myself along

592
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:33,500
with Rogen's Joey Diaz and other

593
00:19:31,159 --> 00:19:35,750
podcasts and being a Deadhead myself I

594
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:38,450
feel like we are cut from the same cloth

595
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:39,648
keep it up my man that's kind of cool

596
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:42,440
did you say you feel like we're friends

597
00:19:39,648 --> 00:19:43,279
I have always felt that the podcasters I

598
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:47,059
have listened to

599
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:48,349
a long time usually comedians when I go

600
00:19:47,059 --> 00:19:49,879
see those comedians I feel like I've

601
00:19:48,349 --> 00:19:51,109
already developed some sort of a

602
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:54,350
relationship with them because I've been

603
00:19:51,109 --> 00:19:56,059
listening to Joey Diaz until you've

604
00:19:54,349 --> 00:19:58,099
listed Joey right here in the email I've

605
00:19:56,059 --> 00:20:00,319
been listening to Joey for years I could

606
00:19:58,099 --> 00:20:01,699
say probably five years solid maybe more

607
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:03,769
than that I honestly don't remember what

608
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,150
I've discovered uncle Joey but I've been

609
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:07,609
listening to Joey religiously every

610
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:09,530
podcast he goes on I listen to every

611
00:20:07,609 --> 00:20:11,659
episode he puts out I go to any special

612
00:20:09,529 --> 00:20:14,000
he does try to listen every time he

613
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:16,580
comes to Denver I'm there when I'm there

614
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,349
in Denver I've tweeted the guy enough to

615
00:20:16,579 --> 00:20:20,990
where he recognizes my name he

616
00:20:18,349 --> 00:20:23,000
recognizes my little Twitter icon uh he

617
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:24,170
we know each other now and we don't know

618
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
each other we just know each other

619
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:28,640
because I listened to him two days a

620
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,039
week talk about whatever crazy [ __ ] he

621
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,450
did in a tease and then when I see him I

622
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:33,559
tweet him enough to where he replies and

623
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:35,509
then when I see him it's like we know

624
00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:37,009
each other it's really neat so man I

625
00:20:35,509 --> 00:20:38,629
appreciate that you think we're friends

626
00:20:37,009 --> 00:20:39,950
we are friends if you're ever around in

627
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:41,750

00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:48,770
family dude ought to put me to say

631
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:50,990

632
00:20:48,769 --> 00:20:52,639

633
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:54,410

634
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,509
compliment and then if you're a Deadhead

635
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:58,970
bro we are cut from the same cloth we

636
00:20:56,509 --> 00:21:00,829
are we're we're family so let's smoke a

637
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:02,750
dad one of these days now let me answer

638
00:21:00,829 --> 00:21:04,009
your main question your main question is

639
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:05,839
for someone like you who isn't in a

640
00:21:04,009 --> 00:21:07,819
legal State what is your best bet on

641
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:10,490
getting high quality seeds

642
00:21:07,819 --> 00:21:12,169
I of course recommend the dank team com

643
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:14,269
they are in America so you don't have to

644
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:16,130
worry about any customs type shipping

645
00:21:14,269 --> 00:21:16,599
let me say this to keep myself out of

646
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:20,180
trouble

647
00:21:16,599 --> 00:21:22,069
if you buy seeds from anywhere it is

648
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:25,039
your responsibility to know the laws in

649
00:21:22,069 --> 00:21:27,139
your area if you have seeds and it is

650
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:28,430
illegal to grow them be sure that you

651
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:29,870
were only purchasing them for the

652
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:31,850
intention of collecting and preserving

653
00:21:29,869 --> 00:21:33,769
those genetics if it's illegal in your

654
00:21:31,849 --> 00:21:35,509
state promise yourself that you will

655
00:21:33,769 --> 00:21:37,910
never grow those you're only buying them

656
00:21:35,509 --> 00:21:39,379
to have them as a collectible so that

657
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:40,700
perhaps something goes down and there's

658
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:42,740
Armageddon and there are no more

659
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:44,600
cannabis seeds you could be the only one

660
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:46,670
on the planet that's got these seeds

661
00:21:44,599 --> 00:21:49,699
preserved and it'll be like a historical

662
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:53,090
thing you're like a curator of fine

663
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:54,620
quality cannabis collectibles also maybe

664
00:21:53,089 --> 00:21:56,000
one day your state will go legal and

665
00:21:54,619 --> 00:21:56,569
that's what you're waiting for

666
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,159
that's

667
00:21:56,569 --> 00:21:59,629
yeah so don't buy seeds with the

668
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:02,000
intention to grow them if you live in an

669
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:03,528
illegal State the dank team.com will

670
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,398

671
00:22:03,528 --> 00:22:06,349
collectibles

672
00:22:04,398 --> 00:22:07,758
if you live in illegal states if you

673
00:22:06,349 --> 00:22:09,048
leave them live in a legal state feel

674
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:10,579
free to grow them and see what comes out

675
00:22:09,048 --> 00:22:12,558
of them you will be impressed and amazed

676
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:14,750
ah one thing that I've got to say I

677
00:22:12,558 --> 00:22:16,069
don't know what happens if you get seeds

678
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,538
shipped to you and you live in an

679
00:22:16,069 --> 00:22:19,369
illegal State and that package gets

680
00:22:17,538 --> 00:22:21,408
intercepted I don't know what happens

681
00:22:19,369 --> 00:22:23,119
with that I cannot be responsible for

682
00:22:21,409 --> 00:22:25,970
that you may want to check with your own

683
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:28,579
legal counsel or somebody like that

684
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:30,470
figure it out before you do it and don't

685
00:22:28,579 --> 00:22:32,359
find out the hard way because honestly I

686
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:34,700
don't know what could happen to you or

687
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:36,769
the sender I don't know I do know that

your heart at hotmail.com I would love

719
00:23:33,528 --> 00:23:38,450
to answer your questions yeah since

720
00:23:36,769 --> 00:23:39,970
we're talking about purchasing seeds I

721
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:44,720
want to talk a little bit about

722
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:47,870
expectations from a seed pack I believe

723
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:51,019
that if you have realistic expectations

724
00:23:47,869 --> 00:23:53,209
when you buy seeds you will be much less

725
00:23:51,019 --> 00:23:55,490
disappointed and much happier with your

726
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:57,470
purchase when the time comes to harvest

727
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:59,509
your plants if you think about it it

728
00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:01,220
takes about a hundred and twenty days to

729
00:23:59,509 --> 00:24:02,569
grow a crop of cannabis from a seed it

730
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:04,308
could take longer it could take a little

731
00:24:02,569 --> 00:24:06,079
shorter depends on your style I'm gonna

732
00:24:04,308 --> 00:24:07,579
say a hundred and twenty days maybe a

733
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:08,460
hundred and fifty days to grow a crop of

734
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:10,409
cannabis

735
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:13,079
that's four to six months to grow this

736
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:14,279
crop you probably ordered the seeds and

737
00:24:13,079 --> 00:24:15,480
depending on where you order from it's

738
00:24:14,279 --> 00:24:18,599
gonna take a week or two to get them

739
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:20,039
there so now you're looking at like four

740
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:20,969
months plus two more weeks or at

741
00:24:20,039 --> 00:24:22,769
eighteen weeks

742
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:23,880
you probably shopped on the seeds for

743
00:24:22,769 --> 00:24:25,829
like a week and thought what you were

744
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:27,000
gonna buy then in another week you had

745
00:24:25,829 --> 00:24:29,849
to wait for a paycheck so you're looking

746
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,890
at like twenty four weeks from the time

747
00:24:29,849 --> 00:24:34,109
you purchase from the time you decide to

748
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:35,490
purchase the strain you're gonna get to

749
00:24:34,109 --> 00:24:37,829
the time you actually get to cut them

750
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:39,859
down so it would make a lot of sense to

751
00:24:37,829 --> 00:24:43,169
do plenty of research and investigation

752
00:24:39,859 --> 00:24:44,939
before you order your seeds instead of

753
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:46,170
buying some seeds throwing them in the

754
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:47,670
garden and then trying to figure out

755
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:48,960
what you're going to do with these

756
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:51,750
plants that you don't know what to

757
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:53,730
expect most websites that sell seeds

758
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:56,309
have very good description of what you

759
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:58,860
can expect from those seeds those are

760
00:24:56,309 --> 00:25:00,750
mostly accurate a lot of people are

761
00:24:58,859 --> 00:25:02,399
salespeople breeders want you to buy

762
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:04,230
their seeds so they will butter up the

763
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,300
descriptions just just just like any

764
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:07,710
other product so you have to find a

765
00:25:06,299 --> 00:25:09,720
breeder that you trust and then you have

766
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:11,069
to find a seed line that has been out

767
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:12,839
for a minute that's been tested I know

768
00:25:11,069 --> 00:25:14,369
everybody wants to grab the hot new [ __ ]

769
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:16,019
but sometimes it's better to wait a

770
00:25:14,369 --> 00:25:17,669
little bit because sometimes when you

771
00:25:16,019 --> 00:25:19,920
grab the hot new [ __ ] you find out that

772
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:21,990
it really wasn't as hot it was more [ __ ]

773
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:23,400
and then you've got a bunch of that in

774
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:26,039
your grow room and you're disappointed

775
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:27,870
you've gone and spent $1,000 on this one

776
00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:29,129
breeder and bought ten packs of his [ __ ]

777
00:25:27,869 --> 00:25:30,509
you know you got a bunch of crap in your

778
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:32,130
grow because he released stuff without

779
00:25:30,509 --> 00:25:34,470
testing it he put it out too early

780
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:37,920
something like that so do some research

781
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:39,839
before find a reputable breeder find a

782
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:41,940
strain that gets your attention figure

783
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:43,349
out what you're looking for when you're

784
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:46,259
shopping for seeds there are several

785
00:25:43,349 --> 00:25:48,209
things to consider do you want an indica

786
00:25:46,259 --> 00:25:49,950
do you want a sativa what kind of

787
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:52,170
effects do you want do you want it to be

788
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:55,350
a mind racing thing do you want it to be

789
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:56,910
a body thing is this for medicinal uses

790
00:25:55,349 --> 00:25:58,949
is somebody going to be smoking this

791
00:25:56,910 --> 00:26:00,269
cannabis for a medical reason you need

792
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:01,740
to find a strain that works for their

793
00:26:00,269 --> 00:26:03,269
medical condition hopefully they've been

794
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:04,529
shopping around in dispensaries buying

795
00:26:03,269 --> 00:26:06,509
different strains hopefully you've done

796
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:08,009
some research and you know what kind of

797
00:26:06,509 --> 00:26:10,109
works for them if you're a new grower a

798
00:26:08,009 --> 00:26:11,579
new smoker a new medical patient you're

799
00:26:10,109 --> 00:26:13,649
gonna have to do some research on what

800
00:26:11,579 --> 00:26:15,990
types of effects you want from these

801
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:18,030
plants so think about if you want indica

802
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:19,470
or sativa or a hybrid or what type of

803
00:26:18,029 --> 00:26:21,359
effect you're looking for if you're

804
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:22,110
going for the mind for the body think

805
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:23,939
about stuff like

806
00:26:22,109 --> 00:26:26,189
to start then you're gonna need to think

807
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:28,048
about height do you have a lot of height

808
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:30,240
in your grow room can you grow real tall

809
00:26:28,048 --> 00:26:31,920
plants think about the space that you've

810
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,808
got you've gotta buy plants you've gotta

811
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:35,308
buy seed that will produce plants that

812
00:26:33,808 --> 00:26:37,230
you're going to be able to fit into your

813
00:26:35,308 --> 00:26:38,819
space if you've got a short space you're

814
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:41,220
not gonna want super Silver Haze

815
00:26:38,819 --> 00:26:42,599
if you've got a really tall space you

816
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:44,250
might want to put some taller Hayes's

817
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:46,169
some longer flowering plants in there

818
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:47,339
just depends on how much space you've

819
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:49,830
got think about that when you're

820
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:51,629
shopping for seeds don't get Hayes's and

821
00:26:49,829 --> 00:26:53,730
sativas if you've got low ceilings if

822
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:55,980
you don't have a lot of room think about

823
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:57,599
how much time you want these crops to

824
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:59,279
take think about how much time you can

825
00:26:57,599 --> 00:27:01,649
dedicate to flowering plants you don't

826
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:03,569
want to go buy once again you don't want

827
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:05,610
to buy a Hays plant that's gonna take

828
00:27:03,569 --> 00:27:07,649
you 10 to 12 weeks if you don't have 10

829
00:27:05,609 --> 00:27:09,240
to 12 weeks to flower something if you

830
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:10,980
need product sooner if you're a cash

831
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,779
crop er you want something that's closer

832
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:13,798
to 8 or 9 weeks if you're growing

833
00:27:12,779 --> 00:27:16,319
because you want that head-ripping

834
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:18,389
sativa you might want an 11 or 12 weaker

835
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:19,980
but think about that before you buy the

836
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:21,960
seeds because once you've got them

837
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:23,700
there's no seed bank in the planet it's

838
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,929
gonna take seeds back from anybody you

839
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:26,669
could open them up you could have spit

840
00:27:24,929 --> 00:27:28,500
on them gonna put other seeds in there

841
00:27:26,669 --> 00:27:28,890
they don't take [ __ ] back all sales are

842
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,220
final

843
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:35,040
with all seed companies so be careful

844
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:37,200
also think about yields what do you need

845
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:39,269
big yields are you a cash crop er are

846
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,069
you growing for medicinal reasons you

847
00:27:39,269 --> 00:27:42,808
yields may be really important to you

848
00:27:41,069 --> 00:27:44,579
for a medical grower yields are

849
00:27:42,808 --> 00:27:46,529
important but not as important if you're

850
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:49,259
growing for medicinal purposes you need

851
00:27:46,529 --> 00:27:51,000
to worry that that specific phenotype

852
00:27:49,259 --> 00:27:52,619
and we're gonna get to that the specific

853
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,808
strain has a specific phenotype that

854
00:27:52,619 --> 00:27:56,969
works for the specific patient's

855
00:27:54,808 --> 00:27:58,259
specific condition and that's one of the

856
00:27:56,970 --> 00:28:01,740
beauties about growing from seed is you

857
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:03,569
can select that for your patient so

858
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:05,039
maybe yield matters to you yield matters

859
00:28:03,569 --> 00:28:06,509
to everybody because you have to pay for

860
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:07,950
the electricity you have to pay for the

861
00:28:06,509 --> 00:28:09,599
nutrients you have to pay for the dirt

862
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:11,308
you have to pay for all of that so

863
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:13,409
hopefully you get enough yield to make

864
00:28:11,308 --> 00:28:15,779
it worth your time and your energy and

865
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:19,080
your budget how much work are these

866
00:28:15,779 --> 00:28:20,579
plants gonna take something like and

867
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:22,379
trying to find some stranger Jilly bean

868
00:28:20,579 --> 00:28:23,699
Jilly bean is really easy to grow Jilly

869
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:25,380
bean you put her in dirt you watch her

870
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:27,090
grow that's from TGA sub-cooled genetics

871
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:28,230
shout-out to my friends at TJ sub cool

872
00:28:27,089 --> 00:28:29,609
see I could have used one of my own

873
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:32,279
strains instead I used a sub cool

874
00:28:29,609 --> 00:28:33,689
genetics ah Jilly bean she's really easy

875
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:35,160
to grow you may need one stick in the

876
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:36,100
middle just to hold that top Cola up if

877
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,720
she gets real huge

878
00:28:36,099 --> 00:28:39,099
if she gets real big branches you may

879
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:41,350
need a couple of sticks to hold those up

880
00:28:39,099 --> 00:28:43,029
put a stick on there use a fuzzy tire

881
00:28:41,349 --> 00:28:44,919
some plant tape or something just hold

882
00:28:43,029 --> 00:28:47,259
those sticks the buds - the giant sticks

883
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:49,870
that's real easy Jilly bean is really

884
00:28:47,259 --> 00:28:52,180
easy to grow something like my Bounty

885
00:28:49,869 --> 00:28:54,849
Killer the Bounty Killer gets really

886
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:56,860
long arms and girls really really big so

887
00:28:54,849 --> 00:28:58,480
she's a little harder to grow she's

888
00:28:56,859 --> 00:29:01,149
gonna need more space she may need some

889
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:03,130
trellising she's gonna need more work so

890
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:04,840
think about what you're able to do can

891
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:07,030
you get in there and put these plants

892
00:29:04,839 --> 00:29:08,529
under a trellis can you handle putting a

893
00:29:07,029 --> 00:29:10,420
lot of stakes in the plants if you can't

894
00:29:08,529 --> 00:29:12,099
be there a lot if you're just gonna set

895
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:14,259
up a hydro grow and leave and come back

896
00:29:12,099 --> 00:29:15,730
every now and then when you need to then

897
00:29:14,259 --> 00:29:17,410
something like Bounty Killer wouldn't be

898
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:18,610
ideal for you something more simple to

899
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:20,800
grow something that you don't have to

900
00:29:18,609 --> 00:29:22,179
mess with a whole bunch cookie rec from

901
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:23,919
Ken Avenger I've got a phenotype of

902
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:25,870
cookie wreck that you don't even have to

903
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:27,370
water it water it once or twice and it

904
00:29:25,869 --> 00:29:28,959
just [ __ ] lives forever I don't know

905
00:29:27,369 --> 00:29:31,389
how it does it it loves to be bone-dry

906
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:33,100
it thrives when it's dry so something

907
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:35,530
like that something that they say hey it

908
00:29:33,099 --> 00:29:37,299
likes dry in the description that may be

909
00:29:35,529 --> 00:29:39,039
better for you so think about how much

910
00:29:37,299 --> 00:29:41,019
work you're going to need to put into

911
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:42,579
the strain that you are purchasing if

912
00:29:41,019 --> 00:29:44,170
you're buying a short stocky indica that

913
00:29:42,579 --> 00:29:45,429
finishes in eight weeks it's not gonna

914
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:47,320
be a whole bunch of work if you've got

915
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:49,269
at all stretchy sativa that takes 12

916
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:49,689
weeks that's gonna be a lot of [ __ ]

917
00:29:49,269 --> 00:29:50,950
work

918
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:52,960
and if you haven't grown a lot of

919
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:54,279
cannabis do both of those things grow

920
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,410
yourself an 8-week indica and then grow

921
00:29:54,279 --> 00:29:59,079
a twelve-week sativa see what it's like

922
00:29:56,410 --> 00:30:00,850
if you've got a small room and you

923
00:29:59,079 --> 00:30:02,470
overcrowd yourself with that sativa and

924
00:30:00,849 --> 00:30:04,089
you've still got four more weeks to go

925
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:06,880
you're looking at life going [ __ ] what

926
00:30:04,089 --> 00:30:09,789
am I gonna do it gets stressful anyway

927
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:11,410
think about aromas and flavors the

928
00:30:09,789 --> 00:30:13,299
descriptions of the aromas and flavors

929
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:15,279
are sometimes kind of fantastical I

930
00:30:13,299 --> 00:30:17,159
would look for reviews on the strains if

931
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:20,049
you're going by flavors and aromas

932
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:22,480
sometimes the breeders will definitely

933
00:30:20,049 --> 00:30:24,009
inflate the the descriptions when it

934
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,880
comes to flavors and aromas they'll try

935
00:30:24,009 --> 00:30:28,359
to tell you that it tastes like

936
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:30,850
bubblegum coated in sugar coated in

937
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:32,619
grape juice rolled in pine needles and

938
00:30:30,849 --> 00:30:33,669
by then you're lost your tongue doesn't

939
00:30:32,619 --> 00:30:35,919
even know what the hell to think of I

940
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:37,870
try to keep my descriptions fairly to

941
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:39,670
the point and really quick but be

942
00:30:37,869 --> 00:30:42,709
careful if that's what you're shopping

943
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:44,420
for also

944
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:46,490
and this is a big part of what I'm going

945
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:49,519
to talk about but read about the

946
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:51,259
phenotypes or do research on the seeds

947
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:53,359
that you're buying to see what types of

948
00:30:51,259 --> 00:30:55,670
variation come from those seeds those

949
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:57,649
are called phenotypes see what types of

950
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:59,930
phenotypes are known for coming from

951
00:30:57,650 --> 00:31:01,850
those seeds and what the numbers are

952
00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:03,259
for getting those phenotypes I like to

953
00:31:01,849 --> 00:31:05,719
use Jillybean a lot when I talk about

954
00:31:03,259 --> 00:31:07,460
phenotypes big shout-out to miss Jill

955
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:09,230
and sub cool from TGA genetics but the

956
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:10,759
Jillybean I like to talk about her when

957
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:12,980
I talk about phenotypes there are three

958
00:31:10,759 --> 00:31:14,809
phenotypes that you generally get from a

959
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:15,289
pack of jellybeans so if you pop ten

960
00:31:14,809 --> 00:31:17,029
seeds

961
00:31:15,289 --> 00:31:18,230
we'll see you get five males and got

962
00:31:17,029 --> 00:31:20,240
five females to deal with you're

963
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:22,610
probably gonna have a candy store fee

964
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:24,470
know the orange vino and the one that is

965
00:31:22,609 --> 00:31:26,599
just kind of in the middle that's just

966
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:27,559
basic it's the basic [ __ ] fee no it

967
00:31:26,599 --> 00:31:30,019
doesn't really have a name it's not

968
00:31:27,559 --> 00:31:32,269
known but that candy store and the

969
00:31:30,019 --> 00:31:33,769
orange Fino are popular fee knows so you

970
00:31:32,269 --> 00:31:35,509
could if you're gonna buy some jelly

971
00:31:33,769 --> 00:31:36,980
bean you could go research what they

972
00:31:35,509 --> 00:31:38,809
look like what they smell like you could

973
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:40,279
see pictures of both phenotypes you

974
00:31:38,809 --> 00:31:41,659
could get very good description to both

975
00:31:40,279 --> 00:31:43,369
phenotypes through the internet through

976
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:44,750
a little bit of searching I'd go to web

977
00:31:43,369 --> 00:31:46,339
forums and just search for the name of

978
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:48,710
the strain and then type fee no

979
00:31:46,339 --> 00:31:50,179
variations or phenotypes available or

980
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:51,920
common phenotypes and I'll start showing

981
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:53,630
you and you'll start seeing it and then

982
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:54,830
you'll know what your chances are of

983
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:56,690
finding that when it's kind of like

984
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:58,279
buying baseball cards you guys sometimes

985
00:31:56,690 --> 00:32:00,920
we're all looking for that [ __ ] Mickey

986
00:31:58,279 --> 00:32:02,629
Mantle and sometimes you find it you

987
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,920
just got to run seeds and you never know

988
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:05,900
what you're gonna get but if you do some

989
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:08,810
research you know how many Mickey Mantle

990
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:10,850
cards are put through how many packs so

991
00:32:08,809 --> 00:32:12,980
you can at least think about if I buy a

992
00:32:10,849 --> 00:32:15,199
10 pack of this drained what are my

993
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:16,640
chances of finding my keeper that I am

994
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,200
the phenotype that I'm looking for

995
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:20,840
you could probably narrow it down a

996
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:22,400
little by doing some research alright so

997
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:23,990
once you've decided what strain you want

998
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:25,580
to grow and who you're going to order

999
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:26,900
from there are several places to order

1000
00:32:25,579 --> 00:32:28,250
you guys but I highly recommend that

1001
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:29,269
dank team.com they may not have

1002
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:30,950
everything you're looking for but

1003
00:32:29,269 --> 00:32:33,259
they've got plenty of good [ __ ] on there

1004
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:34,279
so check them out ah once you've decided

1005
00:32:33,259 --> 00:32:35,629
what you're gonna order and where you

1006
00:32:34,279 --> 00:32:38,629
gonna order from you need to decide if

1007
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:40,940
you want regular or feminized seeds many

1008
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:43,040
of the strains available now come out in

1009
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:44,330
regular seeds and then shortly after

1010
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:46,970
that they are released by the same

1011
00:32:44,329 --> 00:32:48,799
breeder in feminized form now if you're

1012
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:50,600
not familiar with feminized seeds let me

1013
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:52,730
tell you what they are when you grow

1014
00:32:50,599 --> 00:32:54,799
cannabis from regular seeds you have a

1015
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:56,240
chance of having male or female plants

1016
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:57,799
of course in the cannabis garden

1017
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,390
if you're growing four buds you only

1018
00:32:57,799 --> 00:33:00,019
want the female plants you would remove

1019
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:01,520
the males

1020
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:03,619
a lot of people don't want to deal with

1021
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:06,529
the male's so we have devised a way to

1022
00:33:03,619 --> 00:33:08,839
create plants to create seeds that will

1023
00:33:06,529 --> 00:33:10,099
only create female plants a lot of

1024
00:33:08,839 --> 00:33:11,659
people think it's [ __ ] a lot of

1025
00:33:10,099 --> 00:33:13,639
people think they're hermaphrodites I

1026
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:14,390
understand how it works I can teach you

1027
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:16,190
how it works

1028
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:18,230
it is not [ __ ] they are not

1029
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:19,580
hermaphrodites I can give you a brief

1030
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:21,110
lesson on how I do it because that's not

1031
00:33:19,579 --> 00:33:23,539
what this episode is about but quickly

1032
00:33:21,109 --> 00:33:25,459
here's how it goes I take a female plant

1033
00:33:23,539 --> 00:33:27,349
I treat it with the product that I make

1034
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:28,970
at home it is called silver thiosulfate

1035
00:33:27,349 --> 00:33:31,369
I treat the plant with silver

1036
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:33,230
thiosulfate each strain needs a

1037
00:33:31,369 --> 00:33:34,909
different treatment regimen some plants

1038
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:36,710
want to get hit real hard with a heavy

1039
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:39,290
dilution some want to be sprayed more

1040
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:40,430
frequently with a lower dilution rate it

1041
00:33:39,289 --> 00:33:42,109
depends on the strain you have to

1042
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:43,910
experiment with that I will spray a

1043
00:33:42,109 --> 00:33:46,279
female plant with silver thiosulfate

1044
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:49,850
that female plant will put out a

1045
00:33:46,279 --> 00:33:51,500
response the silver disrupts the copper

1046
00:33:49,849 --> 00:33:53,179
movement in the plant which creates an

1047
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:55,369
ethylene reaction in the plant which

1048
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:58,039
triggers the plant to produce male

1049
00:33:55,369 --> 00:34:00,799
flowers those male flowers will produce

1050
00:33:58,039 --> 00:34:01,549
pollen that only contains female

1051
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:04,609
chromosomes

1052
00:34:01,549 --> 00:34:06,859
since my plant is a female there are no

1053
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:09,349
male chromosomes in this plant so the

1054
00:34:06,859 --> 00:34:11,989
pollen that comes out is female I put

1055
00:34:09,349 --> 00:34:15,139
that pollen onto a female plant now I

1056
00:34:11,989 --> 00:34:19,129
have only used female genes so all of

1057
00:34:15,139 --> 00:34:22,279
the progeny the seeds will be female if

1058
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:24,110
I did this correctly they will all be

1059
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:26,780
females and I know what I'm doing so

1060
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:29,000
when I do this it happens correctly

1061
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:29,960
there's no witchcraft to it there's no

1062
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,369
tricking the plant

1063
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:34,550
there's no genetically modifying

1064
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:36,349
anything this is just basic science from

1065
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:38,750
triggering the plant by treating it with

1066
00:34:36,349 --> 00:34:41,179
the chemical you disrupt one part of the

1067
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:42,500
plant to trigger a desired response and

1068
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:44,449
I've done it several times I've

1069
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:46,010
researched it very well and this is how

1070
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:47,449
you make Femina how we make feminized

1071
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:49,580
seeds how I make feminized seeds it's

1072
00:34:47,449 --> 00:34:50,960
how modern feminized seeds are made now

1073
00:34:49,579 --> 00:34:52,639
I will give you guys credit that say

1074
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:55,070
that feminized seeds were all

1075
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:56,989
hermaphrodites back in the day maybe a

1076
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:58,760
long time ago when the FEM seeds started

1077
00:34:56,989 --> 00:35:00,469
yes the way they were doing that is just

1078
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:01,670
turning on the whites during the

1079
00:35:00,469 --> 00:35:03,469
flowering cycle and they should be

1080
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:05,240
asleep messing with the light cycle

1081
00:35:03,469 --> 00:35:07,099
messing with the photo period that will

1082
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:09,979
definitely cause plants to throw seeds

1083
00:35:07,099 --> 00:35:11,868
those seeds do not have

1084
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:14,480
only chromosomes those plants will have

1085
00:35:11,869 --> 00:35:16,490
a tendency to have intersex traits which

1086
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,108
mean it'll be male and female at the

1087
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:20,719
same time also known as a hermaphrodite

1088
00:35:18,108 --> 00:35:23,539
also known as cut that [ __ ] down and get

1089
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:25,339
it out of my garden so back in the day

1090
00:35:23,539 --> 00:35:27,500
yes FEM seeds were made with a little

1091
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:28,550
bit of shady shitty practices now we

1092
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,679
understand what we're doing and

1093
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:32,750
feminized seeds are made with science

1094
00:35:30,679 --> 00:35:34,940
with research and I believe in them and

1095
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:36,949
trust in them so if you want to grow

1096
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:37,369
regular or feminized seeds that is up to

1097
00:35:36,949 --> 00:35:39,289
you

1098
00:35:37,369 --> 00:35:40,940
many people are haters on feminized

1099
00:35:39,289 --> 00:35:43,009
seeds it's because they're not educated

1100
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:44,720
but also a lot of people are haters on

1101
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:47,359
feminized seeds who are very educated

1102
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:48,889
because they feel like people breeding

1103
00:35:47,358 --> 00:35:50,690
with feminized seeds will cause problems

1104
00:35:48,889 --> 00:35:52,940
down the line and they feel like

1105
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:54,679
feminized seeds sort of bottlenecks the

1106
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:56,570
progress of cannabis bottlenecks the

1107
00:35:54,679 --> 00:35:59,449
evolution bottlenecks are breeding if

1108
00:35:56,570 --> 00:36:02,480
some folks feel that way I do not I do

1109
00:35:59,449 --> 00:36:04,608
take some responsibility by making way

1110
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:07,250
more regular seeds than I do feminized

1111
00:36:04,608 --> 00:36:09,199
seeds try to counterbalance the damage

1112
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:10,880
that I do by making FEM seeds if anybody

1113
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:12,649
thinks I'm causing any problems I just

1114
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,030
make way more regular seeds to kind of

1115
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:15,950
offset that I don't see a problem with

1116
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:17,990
FEM seeds I think it's really helpful

1117
00:36:15,949 --> 00:36:19,669
for a person who has here in Colorado

1118
00:36:17,989 --> 00:36:22,339
you're allowed to grow six plants

1119
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:23,750
legally you can set up a grow wherever

1120
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:25,519
you want in your house as long as it's

1121
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:27,710
secure and you can grow six plants now

1122
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:30,320
you want to have all six of those come

1123
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:31,970
to fruition hopefully so six feminized

1124
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,500
seeds would be the way to go instead of

1125
00:36:31,969 --> 00:36:34,759
throwing down six seeds and having three

1126
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:36,289
of them become boys and now you got a

1127
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,430
pool three your plants only got three

1128
00:36:36,289 --> 00:36:39,369
left it kind of [ __ ] you get all this

1129
00:36:37,429 --> 00:36:41,599
wasted space you thought you had six

1130
00:36:39,369 --> 00:36:43,730
that's where feminized seeds would come

1131
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:45,589
in very handy so once you've decided

1132
00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:47,679
what strain you want and you've decided

1133
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:50,000
if you want regular or feminized seeds

1134
00:36:47,679 --> 00:36:51,559
that's when you go ahead and make your

1135
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,019
order go to the website of your choice

1136
00:36:51,559 --> 00:36:55,969
the dank team comm find the strains you

1137
00:36:54,019 --> 00:36:57,710
want then you make your order and then

1138
00:36:55,969 --> 00:36:59,179
you patiently wait for those seeds to

1139
00:36:57,710 --> 00:37:01,099
come in the mail if you're in a legal

1140
00:36:59,179 --> 00:37:03,319
state you put them in a safe you put

1141
00:37:01,099 --> 00:37:05,719
them in a safe storage container and you

1142
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:07,369
collect them if you are in a state where

1143
00:37:05,719 --> 00:37:09,079
it is legal to grow cannabis you

1144
00:37:07,369 --> 00:37:12,019
germinate them and you grow them the

1145
00:37:09,079 --> 00:37:14,329
best you can all right now I want to

1146
00:37:12,019 --> 00:37:15,650
talk about expectations of a seed pack

1147
00:37:14,329 --> 00:37:16,909
and I've kind of talked about selecting

1148
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:18,650
seed packs but I haven't really talked

1149
00:37:16,909 --> 00:37:21,049
talked too much about what you should

1150
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:23,690
expect once you start growing your seeds

1151
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:25,700
it seems to me like

1152
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:27,920
a lot of people think that every seed

1153
00:37:25,699 --> 00:37:29,480
they plant is going to be a keeper a lot

1154
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:31,849
of people seem to think that if they buy

1155
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:34,519
a 10 pack of whatever strain is hot

1156
00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:37,039
today vit if they plant one of those

1157
00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:38,389
seeds it's going to grow and look just

1158
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:41,239
like the one in the picture just like

1159
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:43,129
the one that whatever breeder posted on

1160
00:37:41,239 --> 00:37:44,358
the website that you bought it from you

1161
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:45,769
think it's gonna look just like that if

1162
00:37:44,358 --> 00:37:47,598
you plant one seed you think it's gonna

1163
00:37:45,769 --> 00:37:49,068
taste just like the one you bought from

1164
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:51,068
the dispensary that one time you think

1165
00:37:49,068 --> 00:37:53,420
it's gonna get you high just like that

1166
00:37:51,068 --> 00:37:54,858
maybe maybe you're gonna get super

1167
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:56,838
[ __ ] lucky and it'll be that way but

1168
00:37:54,858 --> 00:37:58,909
chances are it is not like that if you

1169
00:37:56,838 --> 00:38:01,578
buy a 10 pack of seeds and you plant 10

1170
00:37:58,909 --> 00:38:03,469
seeds and they're regular seeds you've

1171
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:06,318
got a 50-50 chance of each of those

1172
00:38:03,469 --> 00:38:07,608
seeds being a male or a female um a

1173
00:38:06,318 --> 00:38:09,108
friend of mine message meet the other

1174
00:38:07,608 --> 00:38:11,029
day and said that he got some seeds from

1175
00:38:09,108 --> 00:38:12,199
me that I gave him and he told me every

1176
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:14,660
single one of those seeds in that

1177
00:38:12,199 --> 00:38:16,639
package was a male so he got a bunch of

1178
00:38:14,659 --> 00:38:18,769
seeds and now he has zero [ __ ] growing

1179
00:38:16,639 --> 00:38:19,759
because they were all males it's really

1180
00:38:18,769 --> 00:38:22,039
rare that you get a hundred percent

1181
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:24,790
males but it's possible it's also

1182
00:38:22,039 --> 00:38:27,318
possible that you get all females but

1183
00:38:24,789 --> 00:38:29,329
science says you got a 50-50 chance of

1184
00:38:27,318 --> 00:38:31,420
getting a male or a female from each

1185
00:38:29,329 --> 00:38:34,339
seed so let's say you pop ten seeds

1186
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:36,050
hypothetically 50-50 chance happens five

1187
00:38:34,338 --> 00:38:38,029
males came out those got cold

1188
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:40,700
those are pushed aside now you got five

1189
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:43,460
to choose from if you see anything

1190
00:38:40,699 --> 00:38:45,799
acting funky early and veg when it's

1191
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:47,389
still little I get rid of those if it's

1192
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:48,950
ugly if it's not growing right if it's

1193
00:38:47,389 --> 00:38:50,960
slow if it's shitty if it's got a

1194
00:38:48,949 --> 00:38:54,169
problem I toss it why do I want to waste

1195
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:56,929
space and time and nutrients money

1196
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:58,909
lights air on something that is not

1197
00:38:56,929 --> 00:39:00,588
going to be what I'm looking for if it's

1198
00:38:58,909 --> 00:39:02,420
small and shitty it's always gonna be

1199
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:03,588
small and shitty gonna get rid of it I

1200
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:06,800
don't replace it with something better

1201
00:39:03,588 --> 00:39:08,539
so now let's say let's say you got five

1202
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:10,460
females let's say one of them was just

1203
00:39:08,539 --> 00:39:12,588
growing a little little janky she's gone

1204
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:14,940
now you got four now you've got four to

1205
00:39:12,588 --> 00:39:17,349
choose from

1206
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:19,269
what does suck about seeds is there's

1207
00:39:17,349 --> 00:39:21,849
variation what is [ __ ] awesome about

1208
00:39:19,269 --> 00:39:23,349
seeds is there is variation yes you want

1209
00:39:21,849 --> 00:39:24,940
the one that looks like the picture that

1210
00:39:23,349 --> 00:39:27,369
the breeder posted up to the website

1211
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:29,440
hopefully that's the one you get but

1212
00:39:27,369 --> 00:39:31,930
hopefully you get the one that grows

1213
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:34,088
perfectly for your space hopefully you

1214
00:39:31,929 --> 00:39:35,529
get the one that smells just like you

1215
00:39:34,088 --> 00:39:37,750
want when you walk by it you go damn

1216
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:39,970
that smells good hopefully you find the

1217
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:41,199
one that gives you the effects you are

1218
00:39:39,969 --> 00:39:43,298
after if you're a medical patient

1219
00:39:41,199 --> 00:39:45,250
hopefully one of those four plants

1220
00:39:43,298 --> 00:39:46,838
that's left is the phenotype then when

1221
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:48,670
you smoke it all of your pain goes away

1222
00:39:46,838 --> 00:39:50,318
or all of your anxiety goes away or

1223
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:51,818
you're able to dance like Michael

1224
00:39:50,318 --> 00:39:54,460
Jackson or whatever your goal is

1225
00:39:51,818 --> 00:39:56,259
hopefully you get to finish those four

1226
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:58,720
phenotypes and you get to smoke them and

1227
00:39:56,260 --> 00:40:00,039
one of them was the magic phenotype for

1228
00:39:58,719 --> 00:40:02,439
you that's the cool part about growing

1229
00:40:00,039 --> 00:40:06,369
from seed you get to find the one that

1230
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:07,780
is perfect for you now let me throw in a

1231
00:40:06,369 --> 00:40:09,039
piece of advice here that is just kind

1232
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:11,170
of random but it's something that I

1233
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:12,910
should say whenever you grow whenever

1234
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:14,409
you get a new plant if it's a clone if

1235
00:40:12,909 --> 00:40:16,239
it's a seed whenever you grow a plant

1236
00:40:14,409 --> 00:40:18,308
for the first time make sure you take a

1237
00:40:16,239 --> 00:40:20,108
clone of it because that may be the most

1238
00:40:18,309 --> 00:40:21,339
amazing herb you've ever grown and if

1239
00:40:20,108 --> 00:40:23,920
you don't have a clone if you don't have

1240
00:40:21,338 --> 00:40:25,420
a copy of that to grow again you might

1241
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:26,920
be heartbroken it might be some of the

1242
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:29,829
worst [ __ ] you ever experience I had a

1243
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:31,690
plant years ago that I grew from seed

1244
00:40:29,829 --> 00:40:33,220
and I tried to take clones of it so many

1245
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:35,260
times and none of the goddamn clones

1246
00:40:33,219 --> 00:40:36,429
would root I don't know why I wasn't

1247
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:38,049
good at cloning back then but I took

1248
00:40:36,429 --> 00:40:39,608
enough clothes for at least one of those

1249
00:40:38,048 --> 00:40:40,929
clones should have taken root and I

1250
00:40:39,608 --> 00:40:43,088
should have that plant but they just

1251
00:40:40,929 --> 00:40:45,308
wouldn't root and I smoked that weed I

1252
00:40:43,088 --> 00:40:47,108
was like this this is amazing cannabis I

1253
00:40:45,309 --> 00:40:48,970
smoked it with my buddy pops I smoked it

1254
00:40:47,108 --> 00:40:50,798
with Kevin and pop said that that was

1255
00:40:48,969 --> 00:40:52,899
one of the top-five best

1256
00:40:50,798 --> 00:40:54,818
weeds he has ever smoked and that old

1257
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:56,108
man is picky and stubborn and if he said

1258
00:40:54,818 --> 00:40:58,028
it was one of his top five it was damn

1259
00:40:56,108 --> 00:40:59,739
good wheat and I loved it and I don't

1260
00:40:58,028 --> 00:41:01,420
have it I'll never get to smoke it again

1261
00:40:59,739 --> 00:41:03,308
because I couldn't get a clone of it and

1262
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:04,750
I'm sad about it I'm a little bit I'm a

1263
00:41:03,309 --> 00:41:06,430
little bit shook and broken up over it

1264
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:07,750
so take clones of everything that you

1265
00:41:06,429 --> 00:41:10,690
grow if it's the first time keep one

1266
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:11,769
clone alive find out if it's good find

1267
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:12,730
out if you want to smoke that again if

1268
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:14,469
you don't want to smoke it again throw

1269
00:41:12,730 --> 00:41:15,940
those clones away if you love it keep

1270
00:41:14,469 --> 00:41:17,469
that clone and you can grow it over and

1271
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:18,639
over and over again turn that clone into

1272
00:41:17,469 --> 00:41:22,149
a mother plant you can take clones off

1273
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:23,199
it off of it for years all right so I

1274
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:25,269
want to get back to talking about the

1275
00:41:23,199 --> 00:41:26,798
variation and finding the phenotypes it

1276
00:41:25,269 --> 00:41:28,239
does suck that you have variation in

1277
00:41:26,798 --> 00:41:29,949
plants and it kind of depends

1278
00:41:28,239 --> 00:41:31,809
how far the breeder took that plant F

1279
00:41:29,949 --> 00:41:34,480
ones are gonna find a lot of variation F

1280
00:41:31,809 --> 00:41:36,610
- not so much F 3 it's gonna narrow down

1281
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:37,900
by the time you're to the F 4 F 5 you're

1282
00:41:36,610 --> 00:41:39,309
gonna come out with fairly uniform

1283
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:40,059
plants but you'll still find variations

1284
00:41:39,309 --> 00:41:42,639
in there

1285
00:41:40,059 --> 00:41:45,190
I like the variation so when you buy

1286
00:41:42,639 --> 00:41:46,809
seeds expect some variation don't think

1287
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:48,159
you can plant one and it's gonna look

1288
00:41:46,809 --> 00:41:49,449
just like the one on the picture or

1289
00:41:48,159 --> 00:41:51,159
taste just like the one you smoked at

1290
00:41:49,449 --> 00:41:53,949
the dispensary you're gonna have to do

1291
00:41:51,159 --> 00:41:55,449
some work it's called a phyno hunt when

1292
00:41:53,949 --> 00:41:56,980
you're searching through those

1293
00:41:55,449 --> 00:41:58,779
phenotypes to find the one that works

1294
00:41:56,980 --> 00:42:00,730
best for you that's a Fino hunt an

1295
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:02,470
experienced grower like myself loves a

1296
00:42:00,730 --> 00:42:03,909
good Fino hunt it keeps it fresh it

1297
00:42:02,469 --> 00:42:05,829
keeps it new you gotta keep an eye out

1298
00:42:03,909 --> 00:42:07,210
for the males you're excited it's like

1299
00:42:05,829 --> 00:42:08,920
when you're a kid used to get a box of

1300
00:42:07,210 --> 00:42:10,360
cereal and you [ __ ] first thing you

1301
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:11,380
would do is go home and dig your arm all

1302
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:12,460
the way into the cereal and could all

1303
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:13,809
sugary I'm just trying to find that

1304
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:15,460
prize and hope you got the cool prize

1305
00:42:13,809 --> 00:42:16,539
that was on the box that's kind of what

1306
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:19,030
it's like when you grow from seed you

1307
00:42:16,539 --> 00:42:20,710
just can't wait to see what you get so

1308
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:22,630
you finish out those four and then you

1309
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:24,460
get to smoke them all and then hopefully

1310
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:25,750
everybody in the room agrees quite often

1311
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:27,190
there will be some disagreement

1312
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:28,659
everybody will be like I really liked

1313
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:30,519
number two and then somebody be like man

1314
00:42:28,659 --> 00:42:32,349
number four is the one and then be in

1315
00:42:30,519 --> 00:42:33,940
the grower you've got to decide do you

1316
00:42:32,349 --> 00:42:35,619
want the one that harvested the best or

1317
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:37,869
tasted the best that's where you have

1318
00:42:35,619 --> 00:42:39,969
decisions to make try to keep maybe

1319
00:42:37,869 --> 00:42:41,500
maybe the one that harvested the best

1320
00:42:39,969 --> 00:42:43,029
keep that one around and the one that

1321
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:44,230
works the best medically for you keep

1322
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:45,580
that one around that way you can grow

1323
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:47,050
the medical one for your medical head

1324
00:42:45,579 --> 00:42:49,119
stash and you can grow the huge

1325
00:42:47,050 --> 00:42:50,890
Harvester just to have backup buds for

1326
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:52,059
when you smoke all that good [ __ ] maybe

1327
00:42:50,889 --> 00:42:53,980
you can smoke him together make it

1328
00:42:52,059 --> 00:42:56,139
stretch a little bit but the best part

1329
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:58,480
is you get to decide you grew that from

1330
00:42:56,139 --> 00:43:00,190
seed you've got a custom strain now that

1331
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:01,929
nobody else has got around you because

1332
00:43:00,190 --> 00:43:03,280
you've got that phenotype and nobody

1333
00:43:01,929 --> 00:43:04,480
else has it hopefully you've got

1334
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:06,430
something brand new if you're a cash

1335
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:08,019
crop er if you're a black market grower

1336
00:43:06,429 --> 00:43:10,259
that's the way to go then you've got the

1337
00:43:08,019 --> 00:43:12,400
new new [ __ ] that nobody else has

1338
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:13,540
alright so when you buy seeds keep in

1339
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:15,490
mind there's gonna be a little work

1340
00:43:13,539 --> 00:43:17,500
these are not Tomatoes they're not gonna

1341
00:43:15,489 --> 00:43:19,089
grow all the same they are not clones

1342
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:20,860
they're not gonna grow all the same

1343
00:43:19,090 --> 00:43:22,750
they're not genetically modified they're

1344
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:25,269
not gonna grow all the same these are

1345
00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:26,920
seeds there is nature happening here the

1346
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:28,389
breeder can do so much work but we

1347
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:30,789
cannot guarantee you what's going to

1348
00:43:28,389 --> 00:43:32,739
come from a seed weird [ __ ] happens from

1349
00:43:30,789 --> 00:43:35,079
seeds amazing [ __ ] happens from seeds

1350
00:43:32,739 --> 00:43:36,639
that's why I grow from seeds you can

1351
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:38,289
grow something that nobody else has you

1352
00:43:36,639 --> 00:43:40,239
can find something that's way more

1353
00:43:38,289 --> 00:43:42,009
amazing than the last seed grew you can

1354
00:43:40,239 --> 00:43:44,500
keep growing more seeds

1355
00:43:42,010 --> 00:43:46,570
love it I love growing from seed so I

1356
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:47,829
guess what I'm trying to say is expect

1357
00:43:46,570 --> 00:43:51,460
some work you're gonna have to grow the

1358
00:43:47,829 --> 00:43:53,019
seeds take a clone of that seed pull all

1359
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:54,519
of the males from the room as soon as

1360
00:43:53,019 --> 00:43:57,039
you see them show and male pull those

1361
00:43:54,519 --> 00:43:58,539
from the room pull any slow or weird

1362
00:43:57,039 --> 00:44:00,279
plants get rid of those out of there

1363
00:43:58,539 --> 00:44:03,250
then you got to finish out the

1364
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:05,380
phenotypes that you keep trim them dry

1365
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:07,210
them cure them smoke them if you have

1366
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:08,349
lab testing available lab test them if

1367
00:44:07,210 --> 00:44:09,849
that's what you want but I've talked in

1368
00:44:08,349 --> 00:44:11,829
another episode that lab testing isn't

1369
00:44:09,849 --> 00:44:13,389
always the way to go who cares what the

1370
00:44:11,829 --> 00:44:15,549
lab test says if you like smoking

1371
00:44:13,389 --> 00:44:18,159
phenotype a and the lab test says that

1372
00:44:15,550 --> 00:44:19,810
phenotype B has more THC who cares

1373
00:44:18,159 --> 00:44:21,369
keep number a it's the one for you

1374
00:44:19,809 --> 00:44:23,799
you're not growing for a lab you're

1375
00:44:21,369 --> 00:44:25,900
growing for your medicinal needs worry

1376
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:27,820
more about that but smoke it finish it

1377
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:28,840
get it lab tested if you want to make

1378
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:30,820
some hash out of it

1379
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:32,769
maybe if that's what you smoke see what

1380
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:34,360
that does then choose the one that you

1381
00:44:32,769 --> 00:44:35,650
really like or choose the two that you

1382
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:37,000
really like I'm not gonna make a limit

1383
00:44:35,650 --> 00:44:39,039
I'm not gonna limit you you can have as

1384
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,869
many as you choose but pick the ones you

1385
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:42,699
like get rid of the ones that suck for

1386
00:44:40,869 --> 00:44:44,799
you and then you've got clones

1387
00:44:42,699 --> 00:44:46,239
now you can redo it I like to kind of

1388
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:48,010
narrow a ten-pack down to two or three

1389
00:44:46,239 --> 00:44:49,449
and then grow those two or three again

1390
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:51,250
side by side and then I'll narrow it

1391
00:44:49,449 --> 00:44:52,419
down to two then I'd like to think I'm

1392
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:53,920
to narrow it down to one but I always

1393
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:55,869
get [ __ ] stubborn and keep two around

1394
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:57,430
for a real long time and then eventually

1395
00:44:55,869 --> 00:44:58,779
I'll get tired of growing one and I'll

1396
00:44:57,429 --> 00:45:00,339
just I'll get tired to grow on the whole

1397
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:01,690
stream honestly and I'll just keep one

1398
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:04,420
of them around to have it in my library

1399
00:45:01,690 --> 00:45:06,010
and then I'll grow more seeds and then

1400
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:08,079
I'll find something better than one of

1401
00:45:06,010 --> 00:45:09,610
it however many is in my stable usually

1402
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:10,179
I got about twenty female plants maybe a

1403
00:45:09,610 --> 00:45:12,160
little more

1404
00:45:10,179 --> 00:45:13,509
so I'll grow some seeds and I'll see

1405
00:45:12,159 --> 00:45:14,829
what I like and if I find one that

1406
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:16,450
really is better than one of those

1407
00:45:14,829 --> 00:45:17,949
twenty or however many mother plants

1408
00:45:16,449 --> 00:45:20,079
I've chosen to keep it whatever facility

1409
00:45:17,949 --> 00:45:22,809
I'm in if one is better than I will just

1410
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:24,610
coal one like whatever the weakest link

1411
00:45:22,809 --> 00:45:27,279
is we'll get replaced by the new

1412
00:45:24,610 --> 00:45:29,230
seedling but since I'm so stubborn what

1413
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:31,720
ends up happening is I replace that old

1414
00:45:29,230 --> 00:45:33,909
one with two like my two favorite new

1415
00:45:31,719 --> 00:45:35,439
phenotypes until I get bored of growing

1416
00:45:33,909 --> 00:45:37,420
that new strain until I start growing

1417
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:39,039
something new and then I just tossed one

1418
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:41,349
of them and put it in the basically on

1419
00:45:39,039 --> 00:45:43,179
the shelf for preservation with the rest

1420
00:45:41,349 --> 00:45:44,469
of my mother plants and then I will

1421
00:45:43,179 --> 00:45:46,750
decide if I want to breed to it or

1422
00:45:44,469 --> 00:45:48,579
whatnot once you start growing from seed

1423
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:50,559
you may find yourself kind of becoming a

1424
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:52,539
plant hoarder just wanting to pop more

1425
00:45:50,559 --> 00:45:54,489
seeds find that next phenotype see what

1426
00:45:52,539 --> 00:45:55,489
you can pull out of a seed pack next it

1427
00:45:54,489 --> 00:45:58,759
becomes a very

1428
00:45:55,489 --> 00:46:01,039
be addicting hobby a passion and art

1429
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:03,350
whatever you want to call it growing

1430
00:46:01,039 --> 00:46:04,940
from seed is a really fun thing to do I

1431
00:46:03,349 --> 00:46:06,829
really enjoy I love growing from seed

1432
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:08,510
way more than I like growing from clone

1433
00:46:06,829 --> 00:46:10,429
I like clones cuz I know what I'm gonna

1434
00:46:08,510 --> 00:46:12,920
get in a future episode we will do the

1435
00:46:10,429 --> 00:46:14,839
clone versus seed debate I will also do

1436
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:16,010
the regular versus feminized debate if

1437
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:18,050
you've got anything you'd like to

1438
00:46:16,010 --> 00:46:20,360
contribute to those debates you can send

1439
00:46:18,050 --> 00:46:22,820
me info I email me it grow from your

1440
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:24,740
heart at hotmail.com or tweet me at GF

1441
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:26,630
wih podcast I would love to hear your

1442
00:46:24,739 --> 00:46:28,879
side of the debate and you never know

1443
00:46:26,630 --> 00:46:31,519
maybe I'll use part of your email in the

1444
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:33,710
episode all right you guys let's recap

1445
00:46:31,519 --> 00:46:35,239
and start wrapping up this podcast the

1446
00:46:33,710 --> 00:46:37,429
short story is if you buy a pack of

1447
00:46:35,239 --> 00:46:39,319
seeds grow that pack of seeds and don't

1448
00:46:37,429 --> 00:46:41,059
expect to find the exact one that you

1449
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:43,460
saw in the breeders website you're gonna

1450
00:46:41,059 --> 00:46:45,199
have some variation if you plant ten

1451
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:47,630
seeds and they are regular or feminized

1452
00:46:45,199 --> 00:46:49,579
I wouldn't expect all ten of those seeds

1453
00:46:47,630 --> 00:46:51,380
to come to fruition you may not harvest

1454
00:46:49,579 --> 00:46:53,090
all ten of those some of them may need

1455
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:55,160
to get cold for random reasons you may

1456
00:46:53,090 --> 00:46:57,590
have a male you may have a hermaphrodite

1457
00:46:55,159 --> 00:46:59,118
yes regular seeds or feminized seeds can

1458
00:46:57,590 --> 00:47:00,920
be hermaphrodites you need to get those

1459
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:02,539
out of there you may just have weird

1460
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:04,880
weak plants you may have a plant that

1461
00:47:02,539 --> 00:47:06,529
grows way too tall way too fast you may

1462
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:08,390
have one that won't grow at all get rid

1463
00:47:06,530 --> 00:47:09,650
of that [ __ ] so that you can have strong

1464
00:47:08,389 --> 00:47:10,639
healthy plants you don't want to keep

1465
00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:12,889
around something that's a piece of [ __ ]

1466
00:47:10,639 --> 00:47:15,319
so don't expect all 10 of your seeds

1467
00:47:12,889 --> 00:47:17,750
that you plant to come to fruition you

1468
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:19,400
are growing that first round to find the

1469
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:21,530
phenotype that works for you or your

1470
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:23,269
patient or your style or your needs or

1471
00:47:21,530 --> 00:47:25,190
reaches your goal the first grow with

1472
00:47:23,269 --> 00:47:26,599
the seed pack is not meant to be really

1473
00:47:25,190 --> 00:47:28,639
a production girl you will have usable

1474
00:47:26,599 --> 00:47:30,259
material have usable product but it's

1475
00:47:28,639 --> 00:47:32,029
not a production run you want to find

1476
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:33,380
the keeper then that's the one that you

1477
00:47:32,030 --> 00:47:35,359
want to do your production runs with

1478
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:37,099
then you want to dial that one in learn

1479
00:47:35,358 --> 00:47:39,049
how much nutrients she wants learn how

1480
00:47:37,099 --> 00:47:40,608
much humidity she likes learn how long

1481
00:47:39,050 --> 00:47:43,070
you need to let her go maybe she needs 8

1482
00:47:40,608 --> 00:47:44,779
maybe 9 maybe 10 maybe 11 weeks pay

1483
00:47:43,070 --> 00:47:46,910
attention to that get her dialed in but

1484
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:48,890
the first run is just to find that

1485
00:47:46,909 --> 00:47:51,019
phenotype that you're looking for

1486
00:47:48,889 --> 00:47:52,699
