00:00:21,739 --> 00:00:27,899
welcome to the show internet world I'm

3
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:30,660
your host Rasta Jeff this is episode 789

4
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:31,979
of the grow from your heart podcast in

5
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,600
this episode I'm going to give away a

6
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,340
free pack of seeds that's right I've

7
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,800
teamed up with our friends at seeds here

8
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,899
now.com to give away a free pack of irie

9
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:41,939
genetic seeds stay tuned later in the

10
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:44,579
episode I will teach you how to win that

11
00:00:41,939 --> 00:00:46,738
free pack of seeds in this episode I

12
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:48,359
want to talk about stabilization in

13
00:00:46,738 --> 00:00:50,339
cannabis plants it has come to my

14
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:51,659
attention that a lot of the Cannabis

15
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:53,160
World a lot of the Horticulture and

16
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:55,198
growing world does not exactly

17
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:57,718
understand what the word stabilization

18
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:59,280
means when it comes to our plants often

19
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:00,899
times I see people post to the internet

20
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,879
that they got a pack of seeds and they

21
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:04,739
discover intersex plants within that

22
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:07,500
package of seeds and they will attribute

23
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:09,299
that to what they call unstable genetics

24
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,579
now that may be part of the problem but

25
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:14,100
that is not exactly what stability means

26
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:15,900
when it comes to cannabis plants in the

27
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:18,298
Plant World in the Horticultural world

28
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:20,159
in the Botanical World stability means

29
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:22,140
that if we grew out a large batch of

30
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,000
seeds that we will not see multiple

31
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,799
phenotypes in that population that we

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,259
will see stability that all of those

33
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:30,000
phenotypes will be uniform if you drive

34
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:31,140
through a Farmland State one of those

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,060
States where there's a bunch of corn

36
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:34,500
maybe Nebraska maybe you see a bunch of

37
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,540
soybeans maybe you're going through

38
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,040
Kansas as you drive down the road you

39
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:40,259
will notice that every single one of

40
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,060
those corn plants looks exactly the same

41
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:42,959
and all those soybeans look exactly the

42
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,759
same now you're going to say that's

43
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:46,798
genetic modification that's probably

44
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:49,140
part of it but also that is breeding for

45
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,180
stability those plants have been bred to

46
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:53,159
be that phenotype to all be stable

47
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:55,079
because we can't run if you've got acres

48
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:56,880
and acres of corn or acres and Acres of

49
00:01:55,078 --> 00:01:58,500
soybeans you can't have some corn that

50
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:00,599
gets really tall some corn that stays

51
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,640
really short we need uniformity it makes

52
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:04,559
it easier to water it makes it easier to

53
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,820
basically maintain and care for that

54
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,920
crop and it makes harvesting and

55
00:02:05,819 --> 00:02:09,899
processing much easier if everything is

56
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,580
uniform and also the customers the

57
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:13,860
clients the people buying that produce

58
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:16,200
the corn the soybeans whatever produce

59
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,540
they expect uniformity as well so

60
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:20,459
uniformity is basically what we are

61
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:22,679
talking about when it comes to stability

62
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:25,080
in the Botanical world now let's talk

63
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,700
about how we achieve that creating a

64
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:29,340
stable line is all about selective

65
00:02:26,699 --> 00:02:31,199
breeding and good breeding practices the

66
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:32,759
most important thing is starting with

67
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:34,439
quality plants plants that have been

68
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:35,818
stress tested plants that have been

69
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:38,219
through the ring or plants that you know

70
00:02:35,818 --> 00:02:39,719
are a quality breeding plants so if we

71
00:02:38,219 --> 00:02:41,519
are breeding cannabis if we're breeding

72
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:42,900
corn if we're breeding soybeans whatever

73
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,120
you are breeding one of the most

74
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,860
important things to think about is the

75
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,840
starting plants do we have quality

76
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:50,819
starting material if you start with a

77
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,860
plant let's just I like to refer to

78
00:02:50,818 --> 00:02:54,179
cooking and baking or being in the

79
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:56,519
kitchen if you start with ingredients

80
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:58,439
that don't taste good your food will not

81
00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:00,120
come out tasting good if you put more

82
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:01,620
crap and more crap in a pot no matter

83
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,420
how much you cook it how much much you

84
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:05,519
stir it how much you bake it still going

85
00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:07,079
to taste like crap in a pot breeding is

86
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,000
the same way you have to start with

87
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,739
Quality Plants you can't start with crap

88
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,300
plants you can't start with intersex

89
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:13,620
plants you can't start with problematic

90
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:16,379
plants or guess what you're going to

91
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:18,300
breed more intersex problematic plants

92
00:03:16,378 --> 00:03:20,098
so it is all about selective breeding

93
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:22,080
and selecting quality plants to begin

94
00:03:20,098 --> 00:03:23,518
with now I said that one of the most

95
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,019
important things to think about when it

96
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,120
comes to breeding is starting with

97
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:29,459
Quality Plants another very important

98
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,140
thing to think about is having a goal

99
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:32,700
what is your goal what are you trying to

100
00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:34,679
create what are you trying to produce

101
00:03:32,699 --> 00:03:36,000
what's your goal with this breeding

102
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:38,099
project that you are working on

103
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,919
especially if we are going to work it to

104
00:03:38,098 --> 00:03:42,719
F4 F5 if our main goal is to come out

105
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:44,458
with a strain where every seed looks the

106
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:46,378
same wouldn't it be a good idea to start

107
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:48,120
with a solid goal with the solid idea of

108
00:03:46,378 --> 00:03:49,500
what we want so a couple of the most

109
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,819
important things to think about when it

110
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,620
comes to breeding or starting with

111
00:03:50,818 --> 00:03:54,238
Quality Plants and the next thing I

112
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:56,039
always talk about having in mind is

113
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,080
breeding with a goal what's your purpose

114
00:03:56,039 --> 00:04:00,060
what are you trying to create so now

115
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,500
let's say we've got two plants in mind

116
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:03,360
we know they are good breed leading

117
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,400
candidates we've tested them we know

118
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,959
that they are not intersex plants we

119
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,700
know that they handle stress well we

120
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,200
know that they handle environmental

121
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:12,298
change as well we know that they're Pest

122
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:14,280
and pathogen resistant so now we've got

123
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:16,079
two plants now we kind of have an idea

124
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,000
now let's write down a solid breeding

125
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,379
goal when we breed these plants together

126
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
we're going to see a lot of different

127
00:04:19,379 --> 00:04:23,159
Expressions through the different filial

128
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,199
Generations we need to make a guideline

129
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,479
now of what we are looking for so that

130
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,340
the plants don't throw you off sometimes

131
00:04:27,478 --> 00:04:30,359
you'll have an idea you'll grow the

132
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:32,039
plants and then you'll say you know what

133
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,840
I want to go this Direction that's going

134
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,160
to mess up your breathing stay on the

135
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:37,138
map that you made in the very beginning

136
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,580
and make that other direction a bee

137
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:40,379
project let's do that later let's do

138
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:43,319
that at another time maybe maybe

139
00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:45,300
simultaneously if possible but draw that

140
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:46,740
road map and stay on your map because

141
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,780
the plants like to kind of give you

142
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:50,100
ideas and throw you off and your friends

143
00:04:48,779 --> 00:04:51,239
are going to give you input and the

144
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:53,820
internet's going to give you input

145
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:56,040
follow the original idea and get to

146
00:04:53,819 --> 00:04:57,659
where we are going and see how we can do

147
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,220
that with the map that we've drawn and

148
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:00,600
then later on we'll learn how to Branch

149
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:02,580
off and do other side shift but let's

150
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,680
stay fo focused if we're trying to make

151
00:05:02,579 --> 00:05:06,418
a stable line here now let's talk about

152
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,579
stabilizing these plants we've got two

153
00:05:06,418 --> 00:05:09,839
plants hopefully you've got a male and a

154
00:05:08,579 --> 00:05:11,279
female that's the way that this is going

155
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:12,659
to work it's one of the things I would

156
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:13,978
also recommend at this time is starting

157
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:15,660
with plants that are completely

158
00:05:13,978 --> 00:05:17,879
different from each other plants that

159
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:20,280
are too similar to each other just breed

160
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:22,319
more similar [ __ ] so find something that

161
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:24,359
maybe has let's talk specifically about

162
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:26,579
my cross arise arise was a very

163
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:28,740
successful cross because of this factor

164
00:05:26,579 --> 00:05:30,478
I used a Golden Goat female let me

165
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:32,460
describe Golden Goat to you very briefly

166
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:34,560
Golden Goat is kind of known as a

167
00:05:32,459 --> 00:05:37,038
tropical sativa but it also grows short

168
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,360
and squat so it's got a really nice

169
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:40,918
sativa kind of head Buzz really tropical

170
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,660
flavors and it makes really skinny

171
00:05:40,918 --> 00:05:44,639
leaves but it doesn't get super tall

172
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:46,560
like most sativas and you can Harvest it

173
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,939
a little more early than most of the

174
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,100
other sativa plants it'll come down

175
00:05:47,939 --> 00:05:52,259
around week nine which is a great trait

176
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,759
for a sativa kind of buzz type of plant

177
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:56,400
so it's got those skinnier leaves that

178
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:58,560
tropical flavor that sativa style Buzz

179
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:01,319
then I took a daybreaker plant which is

180
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:05,579
Joseph OG and chem D that puts off a a

181
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:07,560
lot of gassy chemicals burnt rubber

182
00:06:05,579 --> 00:06:09,240
fresh tennis ball kind of smells and

183
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:11,339
Aromas completely different than that

184
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,800
tropical sweet candy in the Golden Goat

185
00:06:11,339 --> 00:06:16,079
it also put off big gigantic leaves the

186
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:18,780
leaves are so big on that plant it also

187
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:19,859
makes a lot of crazy Purple colors so I

188
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:22,079
knew that those were completely

189
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:24,060
different so I bread them together to

190
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:25,978
create something brand new and in my

191
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:27,899
opinion in my experience it worked very

192
00:06:25,978 --> 00:06:30,060
well so something I'll recommend at this

193
00:06:27,899 --> 00:06:31,739
time is start with plants that are very

194
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:33,720
different if you can find a male and a

195
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:35,939
female that are very far apart in traits

196
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,560
and flavor Aroma growth structure I

197
00:06:35,939 --> 00:06:40,439
think that is when you have the best

198
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:42,300
success in creating new lines so with

199
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:44,160
that in mind we've got two plants

200
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:45,720
hopefully they're vastly different if

201
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,220
not your breeding project will work with

202
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:49,560
your goal if you've got a goal in mind

203
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:51,720
but I have more fun when they're way

204
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,879
further apart so I've got my mail I've

205
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,620
got my female we've got a breeding goal

206
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:57,600
in mind now the first thing to do is

207
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:59,639
Chuck some pollen let's put some pollen

208
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:02,100
on this female plant then we're going to

209
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:04,800
make seeds this batch of seeds is called

210
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:06,360
the F1 generation the first filial

211
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,800
generation these are brand new seeds

212
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:11,038
they've never been made it's a new cross

213
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:13,319
that is the F1 so from that F1 batch of

214
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:15,300
seeds we will grow them out pay very

215
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:16,979
close attention to what you've done are

216
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,360
there any intersex problems are there

217
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:20,639
mutants are there freaks do you have

218
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:22,620
germination issues or are these quality

219
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,840
plants that you're enjoying the outcome

220
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:26,879
from or do you like growing them do they

221
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:28,619
grow well do they handle problems well

222
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:31,319
are you seeing the phenotypes that you

223
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:33,000
were hoping for so grow those out what I

224
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:34,740
would recommend now is finding the

225
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,899
phenotype that you were looking for when

226
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:38,639
you wrote down your goal you said I want

227
00:07:36,899 --> 00:07:40,679
to find this you want to plant that

228
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:43,379
grows with this shape this structure

229
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:45,538
this flowering time this flavor this

230
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:48,478
Aroma it's got to work in your growth

231
00:07:45,538 --> 00:07:50,879
some people run a scrog some people run

232
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:52,860
uh big wide open Plants some people top

233
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,478
them one time and let them Bush out some

234
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:56,759
people only veg them up six inches tall

235
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:58,860
and flip them do the seeds that you made

236
00:07:56,759 --> 00:08:00,479
work for your grow style can you find

237
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:03,419
the phenotype that is perfect for your

238
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:05,159
grow oh if so let's continue with this

239
00:08:03,418 --> 00:08:06,779
breeding project if you're not finding

240
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,520
the seed that you want the plant that

241
00:08:06,779 --> 00:08:10,019
you want doesn't come out of there then

242
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:11,758
this is not a successful breeding

243
00:08:10,019 --> 00:08:13,620
project which is not a big deal I would

244
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,960
abandon this for now keep those seeds

245
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:17,399
and then pollinate with different plants

246
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:19,318
and different females and try it again

247
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:21,598
until you do find the cross that you're

248
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:23,280
looking for not every cross will be a

249
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:25,740
winner every single time it definitely

250
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:27,959
might not be what you're looking for the

251
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:29,879
first time you make seeds so my point

252
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:32,519
here make that first filial generation

253
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:34,200
grow them out find the one that is

254
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:36,718
exactly what you're looking for you've

255
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:38,459
we've got to do very careful selections

256
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,680
at this point we've got to find exactly

257
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:42,179
what we're looking for so find a male

258
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:43,679
plant and a female plant that have got

259
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:46,019
the traits you're looking for like I

260
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:48,838
said the leaf shape the plank structure

261
00:08:46,019 --> 00:08:50,819
the node spacing the type of branching

262
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:53,160
does it react well to what you want to

263
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:55,500
do find the girl in there for you also

264
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:56,759
find the male plant in there for you now

265
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,839
guess what we're going to do again we're

266
00:08:56,759 --> 00:08:59,399
going to grow the boy we're going to

267
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:02,700
grow the girl and we're going to Chuck

268
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:05,339
some pollen we are now making the F2

269
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:08,940
Generation the f1s now just bred

270
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:11,339
together they make F2 now these f2s are

271
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:14,220
going to show you a lot of crazy [ __ ]

272
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:16,740
the phenotype variation in the F1 won't

273
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:18,180
be as wild as the f2s but you'll see a

274
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:21,180
lot of stuff and the f1s are going to

275
00:09:18,179 --> 00:09:23,219
see uh plants that look 50 50 like the

276
00:09:21,179 --> 00:09:24,778
mom and dad some plants they lean more

277
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:26,278
toward the mom and some plants to lean

278
00:09:24,778 --> 00:09:28,799
toward the dad and then you'll see some

279
00:09:26,278 --> 00:09:30,120
weirdos in there and the F2 we're going

280
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:31,439
to see plants that look like the mom

281
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,419
we're going to see plants that look like

282
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,220
the dad we're going to see plants that

283
00:09:33,419 --> 00:09:37,139
are anywhere between one and a hundred

284
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:40,139
percent the mom and the opposite the dad

285
00:09:37,139 --> 00:09:42,480
so you could have 50 50 60 40 70 30

286
00:09:40,139 --> 00:09:44,819
either direction mom and dad in this

287
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,278
batch of seeds also we're going to see

288
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:49,140
grandparents represent themselves uh

289
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:50,759
whatever was used to make the plants

290
00:09:49,139 --> 00:09:52,259
that you use the parents of those plants

291
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:53,879
they're gonna pop up now and they go hey

292
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:55,259
here we are do you remember me I'm the

293
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:57,179
great grandma or I'm the grandma you

294
00:09:55,259 --> 00:09:58,439
forgot about on the grandpa that you

295
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:59,939
forgot about they're going to pop up and

296
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,320
say what are these weird traits and

297
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:03,120
you're gonna wire the plants doing that

298
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:05,160
that's from Grandma that's from Grandpa

299
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,019
on either side so we've got four

300
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:08,338
grandparents and two parents that can

301
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:10,560
represent themselves here on this cross

302
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:12,839
at this time also you're going to see

303
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:15,179
some weird [ __ ] uh we just took the

304
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:16,740
whole genetic gene pool and put all of

305
00:10:15,179 --> 00:10:19,139
the traits in there every color of eyes

306
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:20,879
every color of hair uh every type of

307
00:10:19,139 --> 00:10:22,080
skin and teeth you can imagine we just

308
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:23,700
shook it up and we're going to get some

309
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,680
weird looking cousins out of this that's

310
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:28,080
what we're going to see in the f2s so it

311
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:29,819
is your job in that F2 Generation to

312
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,740
find the plant that has the traits you

313
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:33,660
want I'm going to keep saying that find

314
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:35,879
the plant that is perfect to continue

315
00:10:33,659 --> 00:10:37,679
this line this is the one that is going

316
00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:39,838
to represent the next line so it's got

317
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:41,159
to be the perfect plant for you does it

318
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,260
have I'm going to keep saying it the

319
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:45,480
leaf size and shape the plant structure

320
00:10:43,259 --> 00:10:47,220
the internodal spacing the branching

321
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:50,159
does it finish on time does it react

322
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:51,720
well to what you do if it does that's

323
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:53,639
the one that you want to keep find that

324
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:55,320
female find that male then guess what

325
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:56,759
we're going to do it's time for them to

326
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:00,660
get it on again we're going to make the

327
00:10:56,759 --> 00:11:02,338
F3 generation in this F3 generation this

328
00:11:00,659 --> 00:11:04,078
is where we start doing a little bit of

329
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:07,019
these stabilization we have gotten rid

330
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:08,879
of that F2 uh the wildness out of the F2

331
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:10,860
Generation the f3s are starting to lock

332
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:13,500
in a little bit we're starting to see a

333
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:15,180
little bit more uniformity which is the

334
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:17,639
idea of stabilization that is what

335
00:11:15,179 --> 00:11:18,958
stabilization is so what are we going to

336
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:20,759
do again we're going to grow out these

337
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:22,559
f3s we're going to find a female we're

338
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:24,539
going to find a male like I keep talking

339
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:26,039
about with the exact perfect traits that

340
00:11:24,539 --> 00:11:28,439
we wrote down the goal that we are

341
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:30,899
seeking we want to find that plant once

342
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:32,399
again if it's not in there that's not a

343
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:34,740
big deal go back and grow more of those

344
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,480
f2s and find those if you have to go all

345
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:38,820
the way back to the f1s and make F2

346
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,379
again do that never be afraid to go

347
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:42,060
backwards and run more of those old

348
00:11:40,379 --> 00:11:43,200
seeds you might not have found what you

349
00:11:42,059 --> 00:11:44,399
were looking for because you might not

350
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,140
even have known what you were looking

351
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,958
for at that time or maybe it just didn't

352
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:51,000
pop up but let's run that F3 let's find

353
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:52,500
the perfect one then what are we going

354
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,200
to do we're going to pollinate that F3

355
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:57,600
with another F3 that's going to make F4

356
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,700
now we're getting super close to

357
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,980
stabilizing this plan at this point you

358
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:04,259
should have probably 70 to 80 percent of

359
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:06,180
your phenotypes looking fairly uniform

360
00:12:04,259 --> 00:12:08,338
if we have done the selection properly

361
00:12:06,179 --> 00:12:10,500
and again the only way to tell if we are

362
00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:12,600
doing this properly is to grow out large

363
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:14,759
batches of these see it grow out as many

364
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,440
as you can I would like to see a

365
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:18,600
thousand of them if possible I

366
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,560
understand that that is not possible for

367
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,959
everybody

368
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:23,699
I'm uh I'm spoiled I'm blessed I'm here

369
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:25,739
in Colorado where I've got access to

370
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:27,420
commercial growth facilities I've got

371
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:29,278
access to a lot of friends that grow I

372
00:12:27,419 --> 00:12:30,899
can give them seeds I can actually rent

373
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:32,519
space from my friends who are no longer

374
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:34,259
growing and grow in their grow spaces

375
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:35,940
you know if I'm renting grow space from

376
00:12:34,259 --> 00:12:37,799
you and I'm producing seed or flour in

377
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:39,839
your space big up and thank you that

378
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:41,639
does help me a lot so

379
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,079
um I recommend a thousand of these seeds

380
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:45,838
if possible I understand that's not

381
00:12:43,078 --> 00:12:47,819
possible for most people maybe do a

382
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:50,220
hundred also I understand that that is

383
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:51,899
not legal for most people I'm going to

384
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:53,700
say follow the rules where you are don't

385
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:55,078
get yourself in any trouble but also

386
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,519
you're a [ __ ] adult do what you want

387
00:12:55,078 --> 00:12:57,419
to do I'm just trying to keep myself out

388
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:58,919
of trouble

389
00:12:57,419 --> 00:13:01,078
um if you can't run a thousand or a

390
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:03,479
hundred seeds at a time you probably can

391
00:13:01,078 --> 00:13:06,120
run 10 at a time can you run 10 of them

392
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:07,500
maybe Run 10 find the best one for now

393
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:09,899
set it in a corner and keep it as a

394
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:11,639
keeper plant then run nine more and just

395
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:13,620
keep doing that until you just eliminate

396
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:14,820
a few until you are satisfied that that

397
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:16,500
is the one that you're looking for

398
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:18,778
there's ways to funeral hunt large

399
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:20,519
batches it just may take more time so I

400
00:13:18,778 --> 00:13:23,159
think I was at F4 when I got off on a

401
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:24,659
rambly tangent there but from that F4 we

402
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:25,980
are going to do the same process we're

403
00:13:24,659 --> 00:13:28,259
going to grow them out we're going to

404
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:29,399
find the plant that has the exact traits

405
00:13:28,259 --> 00:13:31,559
that I'm looking for it should be easy

406
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:32,879
to find by now because by this F4

407
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:34,439
generation we're seeing a lot of

408
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:36,539
uniformity things are starting to really

409
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:38,279
stabilize and settle in so we're going

410
00:13:36,539 --> 00:13:40,500
to find that female that looks exactly

411
00:13:38,278 --> 00:13:42,539
like all of the traits we wrote down the

412
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:44,820
flowering time the growth structure the

413
00:13:42,539 --> 00:13:46,980
node spacing the branching the leaf size

414
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:48,420
and shape colors Aromas we should be

415
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:50,220
smoking all of these have you found out

416
00:13:48,419 --> 00:13:51,778
if it's got the buzz you want does it

417
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:54,120
have the Terps you want is this the

418
00:13:51,778 --> 00:13:56,759
perfect plant for you find that F4

419
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:58,139
generation find a boy find a girl also

420
00:13:56,759 --> 00:13:59,700
by this point you should be pretty good

421
00:13:58,139 --> 00:14:01,740
at selecting male plans that's going to

422
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:03,778
be the real challenge but find that mail

423
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:04,980
find that girl let them do some pollen

424
00:14:03,778 --> 00:14:07,860
Chuck and at this point you've now

425
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:10,259
created F5 and this F5 generation we're

426
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:11,879
going to see really uniform plants among

427
00:14:10,259 --> 00:14:14,519
this population a lot of the plants are

428
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:16,200
going to look very very similar we are

429
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:18,179
now reaching our goal of stabilization

430
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:20,339
so at this point if you grew a hundred

431
00:14:18,179 --> 00:14:21,958
seeds you should probably get get 10

432
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:24,899
plants that don't fit in but the other

433
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:26,518
90 are probably going to look just like

434
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:28,200
each other so now the next step

435
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:30,959
obviously if you want to lock this in

436
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:33,120
even more is to go to the F6 generation

437
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:35,939
I personally don't know any breeders

438
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:38,339
that go to the F6 or Beyond perhaps DJ

439
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:39,839
Short is hitting the F6 generation but

440
00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:42,060
the last I read when he was selling

441
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:44,040
seeds he would take them to F5 and then

442
00:14:42,059 --> 00:14:45,419
stop that way he would leave us room to

443
00:14:44,039 --> 00:14:47,458
breed to them because if he goes any

444
00:14:45,419 --> 00:14:49,259
further it kind of locks in all of the

445
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:50,939
traits that he created that he selected

446
00:14:49,259 --> 00:14:52,259
and when we breed to it that's all

447
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:54,240
that's going to come out is those traits

448
00:14:52,259 --> 00:14:56,519
because that's all that's left that

449
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:59,399
segues me into the next part of talking

450
00:14:56,519 --> 00:15:01,740
about breeding and stabilization

451
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:03,360
um you can accidentally stabilize

452
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:04,740
negative traits if you don't pay

453
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,659
attention negative trades could be

454
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:09,480
intersex or whatever you're not looking

455
00:15:06,659 --> 00:15:11,879
for if that is in your your population

456
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:13,740
of breeding anywhere if you see that and

457
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:15,720
you pass that on in the breeding you

458
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:17,220
could stabilize a negative trait that

459
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:19,079
you weren't looking for so make sure you

460
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:21,240
grow out a lot of seeds make sure you do

461
00:15:19,078 --> 00:15:23,338
a lot of testing make sure that you grow

462
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:25,440
every batch a large population of every

463
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:27,120
batch if possible and select the best

464
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,399
plants from that batch if you're seeing

465
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,899
any problems maybe go backwards and

466
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:32,578
breed from other batches and select

467
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:34,139
better maybe you just selected the one

468
00:15:32,578 --> 00:15:36,299
that carries an intersect straight or

469
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:38,278
one that doesn't speed up doesn't flower

470
00:15:36,299 --> 00:15:39,778
quickly enough you can go back and find

471
00:15:38,278 --> 00:15:42,480
better plants if you wanted to do it

472
00:15:39,778 --> 00:15:43,860
again or you could also back cross for

473
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,360
one of those better Generations if

474
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:47,940
you've got a plant that's super close in

475
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,680
the F4 generation you could take a F1 F2

476
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:51,180
and pollinate that with it it'll give

477
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:53,278
you the traits you're looking for but my

478
00:15:51,179 --> 00:15:54,958
my advice is to keep going forward and

479
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:56,519
keep making it better and if you make a

480
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:58,078
mistake go back to where you made the

481
00:15:56,519 --> 00:15:59,698
mistake and then move forward from there

482
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:01,259
again now a second ago I did mention

483
00:15:59,698 --> 00:16:02,939
back Crossing which leads me into

484
00:16:01,259 --> 00:16:05,039
another thing that I would like to kind

485
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:06,839
of ramble about for a minute here when I

486
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:08,819
think about breeding sometimes I'm

487
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:10,620
thinking about locking in trades but

488
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:13,139
another thing I'm also thinking about is

489
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:14,639
washing out traits now let's talk a

490
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:16,680
little bit about washing out traits and

491
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,120
the reason I want to use back cross is a

492
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:19,979
kind of a guideline for this is because

493
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,839
it's really easy to explain it and

494
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:23,879
you'll understand it if I use back

495
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:25,680
Crossing as an example let's talk

496
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:27,659
quickly about what a back cross is and

497
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:29,278
it'll make sense of all of this let's

498
00:16:27,659 --> 00:16:30,838
just say I've got a plant we'll say

499
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:32,879
Golden Goat because I've done that

500
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:34,500
people want Golden Goat seeds but I

501
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:36,838
don't have a male Golden Goat plant so

502
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:38,940
you can't make regular Golden Goat seeds

503
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:40,980
without making feminized seeds or

504
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:43,139
without adulterating that Golden Goat

505
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:45,420
plant in some sort of way so what I

506
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:46,980
would do what I did is I pollinated the

507
00:16:45,419 --> 00:16:49,019
Golden Goat plant with another plant

508
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:50,820
like I said before a plant that was

509
00:16:49,019 --> 00:16:52,500
vastly different than the Golden Goat

510
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:54,300
this way I could identify the traits and

511
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:56,399
the progeny so I pollinated the Golden

512
00:16:54,299 --> 00:16:57,958
Goat with the daybreaker and from that I

513
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,879
could see those big leaf shapes I could

514
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:01,319
see those skinny Leaf shapes I knew

515
00:16:59,879 --> 00:17:02,939
right away that all of the skinny

516
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:05,039
leaf-shaped plants were the Golden Goat

517
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:06,298
phenotypes and the bigger leaf plants

518
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:08,459
weren't even necessary to keep around

519
00:17:06,298 --> 00:17:11,459
for the back cross project because those

520
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:13,439
were the uh the daybreaker dominant

521
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:15,240
phenotypes so now if I want to make a

522
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:17,819
back Cross of this Golden Goat my idea

523
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:19,439
is to wash out all of those traits of

524
00:17:17,818 --> 00:17:21,720
that daybreaker now how do I wash that

525
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:24,120
that out by simply breeding the Golden

526
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:26,880
Goat to the Golden Goat multiple times

527
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:29,039
now it's basically like adding more

528
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,080
layers of paint until you can't see that

529
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:32,879
daybreaker in there anymore the way that

530
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:34,980
I did that was I took the Golden Goat

531
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,260
and the daybreaker I made seeds now I've

532
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:40,140
got my first cross which is Golden Goat

533
00:17:37,259 --> 00:17:42,779
to daybreaker F1 from there I found a

534
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:45,179
Seedling a male that looked just exactly

535
00:17:42,779 --> 00:17:47,519
like the original golden go I took that

536
00:17:45,179 --> 00:17:50,160
mail and I pollinated that original

537
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:52,558
Golden Goat now I've taken that that

538
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,660
adulterated Golden Goat pollen it's half

539
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:56,759
golden goat half daybreaker and I've put

540
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:59,038
it back on Golden Goat now I'm basically

541
00:17:56,759 --> 00:18:00,960
minimizing the ratio of amount of

542
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:03,538
daybreaker traits in there so that's

543
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,759
going to make the Golden Goat bat cross

544
00:18:03,538 --> 00:18:07,740
one from there we grow out a batch of

545
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:09,779
seeds and I'll find another male that

546
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:11,700
looks exactly like the Golden Goat from

547
00:18:09,779 --> 00:18:14,460
that batch of seeds and I'll put that

548
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:16,440
pollen back on the Golden Goat again and

549
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:18,058
make yet another batch of seeds now do

550
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:20,100
you see what I'm doing each time I add

551
00:18:18,058 --> 00:18:22,440
this Golden Goat to the mix I'm just

552
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:23,819
washing out traits of that daybreaker

553
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,860
we're just washing out those negative

554
00:18:23,819 --> 00:18:27,659
traits so something another thing to

555
00:18:25,859 --> 00:18:29,339
think in mind another way to approach

556
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:31,500
breathing is by thinking about what

557
00:18:29,339 --> 00:18:33,240
traits do you want to wash out and what

558
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:35,279
traits do you want to bring along with

559
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:37,500
you now I know I gave a lot of ratios a

560
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:39,779
lot of fractions and a lot of numbers uh

561
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:41,880
this is all good in theory a lot of

562
00:18:39,779 --> 00:18:43,619
things to think about is uh this is all

563
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:45,480
plant theory if you write down these

564
00:18:43,619 --> 00:18:47,038
ideas write this all down it will look

565
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:49,079
really good on paper but we've got to

566
00:18:47,038 --> 00:18:50,640
keep in mind these are plants they're

567
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:53,939
going to do their own thing sometimes

568
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:56,160
genetics will do their thing you can do

569
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:58,019
uh alial charts you could write Mendel

570
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,700
charts you could do your predictions we

571
00:18:58,019 --> 00:19:01,740
can do our favorite selections but

572
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:04,140
sometimes nature is just going to throw

573
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:07,019
a curveball at you so this is kind of a

574
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:08,759
guideline this is kind of a uh a quick

575
00:19:07,019 --> 00:19:10,619
course on how to stabilize and what

576
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:12,359
stabilization means but keep in mind

577
00:19:10,619 --> 00:19:15,000
when it comes to cannabis plants there

578
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:16,798
will always be variables because nature

579
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,740
always finds a way and guess what nature

580
00:19:16,798 --> 00:19:21,839
always wins alright that is my support

581
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:23,339
on stabilization I did say at the start

582
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:25,619
of this podcast I was going to give away

583

00:20:16,019 --> 00:20:21,298
there I don't like putting like ganja

611
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:22,740
Joe's weed farm on a package that I'm

612
00:20:21,298 --> 00:20:24,720
sending to somebody with seeds in it

613
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:26,460
first of all that just looks Shifty for

614
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,960
the the mailman and then second of all

615
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:29,519
that encourages people to steal your

616
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:32,340
ship plenty of people are stealing the

617
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:35,519
mail and if they see like Joe's weed

618
00:20:32,339 --> 00:20:38,099
farm or ganja Joe or ganja Bob or stone

619
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:39,599
or Dave or whatever on the package that

620
00:20:38,099 --> 00:20:41,219
does encourage theft that just lets them

621
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:43,918
know there might be something smokable

622
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:45,419
or consumable in there or enjoyable in

623
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,559
there and that does encourage them to

624
00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:48,900
steal that so don't get your seeds

625
00:20:46,558 --> 00:20:50,160
stolen that you won because uh that's a

626
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,900
bummer I don't have to send them to you

627
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:53,880
again so you will get an email if you

628
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,900
won from the last seed giveaway of

629
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,460
course I've got your email address

630
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,840
because you did sign up for the mailing

631
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:59,279
list I'm not going to do it that way

632
