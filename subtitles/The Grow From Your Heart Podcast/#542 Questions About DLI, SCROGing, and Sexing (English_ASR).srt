happy over gifted herb I am smoking

44
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:58,769
since you replied enough to ask I'm

45
00:01:56,459 --> 00:02:00,750
smoking purple starburst live batter

46
00:01:58,769 --> 00:02:04,289
from Green Dot labs this is a blend of

47
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:06,390
purple punch skittles and starburst OG

48
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:09,390
on the package the flavors described as

49
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:12,209
spun sugar I think that is cotton candy

50
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:13,619
right grapes and shampoo I know it

51
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:16,348
sounds weird I

52
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:18,030
enjoy that shampoo flavor it's good it

53
00:02:16,348 --> 00:02:19,530
sounds kind of weird I really like it

54
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:22,019
the shampoo is what stands out the most

55
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:23,729
for me uh cotton candy and shampoo

56
00:02:22,019 --> 00:02:25,140
almost like strawberry shampoo I think

57
00:02:23,729 --> 00:02:28,169
it's that old cheap strawberry swab

58
00:02:25,139 --> 00:02:30,179
shampoo I dig it on the back it says it

59
00:02:28,169 --> 00:02:32,729
contains fifty four point eight four

60
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:35,969
percent THC and non detectable amounts

61
00:02:32,729 --> 00:02:38,189
of CBD I'm diggin the purple starburst

62
00:02:35,969 --> 00:02:42,810
starburst spelled with a Z so nobody

63
00:02:38,189 --> 00:02:44,729
gets sued Z ta r bu rst purple starburst

64
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:46,949
from Green Dot labs so obviously got me

65
00:02:44,729 --> 00:02:49,500
stoned and it's doing that [ __ ] to my

66
00:02:46,949 --> 00:02:50,878
throat that passes through the show yeah

67
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,469
it's got me going Michael when you're on

68
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:54,239
the show something just makes us [ __ ]

69
00:02:52,469 --> 00:02:55,709
ramble together I bet if we were in

70
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,239
school they would have separated us we

71
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:59,158
would not have been a lot of classes

72
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:00,750
together like those two guys we got to

73
00:02:59,158 --> 00:03:03,298
keep those two guys coughing separate

74
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:05,250
them we're bad influences on each other

75
00:03:03,299 --> 00:03:06,810
ah this is the point of the show where

76
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:08,848

129
00:04:56,509 --> 00:04:59,779
do promise to give people shoutouts if

130
00:04:58,189 --> 00:05:02,329
they continue to contribute to the

131
00:04:59,779 --> 00:05:03,889
patreon campaign I also promise to read

132
00:05:02,329 --> 00:05:06,169
their emails and answer their questions

133
00:05:03,889 --> 00:05:08,329
a lot of people have sent me a lot of

134
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:10,430
great questions and emails they do not

135
00:05:08,329 --> 00:05:12,259
realize that we're recorded several

136
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:13,730
weeks ahead at this time I think we are

137
00:05:12,259 --> 00:05:15,620
three weeks ahead of ourselves in

138
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:18,080
podcasting so I need to take a break and

139
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:20,090
let us catch up so that the emails are

140
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:22,579
fresher but your messages are coming I

141
00:05:20,089 --> 00:05:23,899
did not forget you you just got to be

142
00:05:22,579 --> 00:05:26,509
patient I only read like three or four

143
00:05:23,899 --> 00:05:28,399
per show and I probably get 25 per week

144
00:05:26,509 --> 00:05:29,870
so the math means that I'm always going

145
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:31,279
to fall behind I'm not complaining that

146
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:33,259
means I've always got content when the

147
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:35,000
apocalypse comes still got emails to

148
00:05:33,259 --> 00:05:38,149
read it's not a it's not a Beth and we

149
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,560
just please yes quality takes time and

150
00:05:38,149 --> 00:05:40,849
I'm going to get to your message I'm

151
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,139
going to get to your patreon shoutouts

152
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:44,860
we're just ahead

153
00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:47,539
so if you sent me a message in June I

154
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:47,900
just now we haven't even gotten you were

155
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,310
already

156
00:05:47,899 --> 00:05:50,870
I'm already recorded almost halfway

157
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:52,160
through June so it's gonna be I don't

158
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:53,750
think you understand what I'm trying to

159
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,160
say my brain got ahead of my mouth but I

160
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:57,139
think my mouths got ahead of my brain

161
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,790
either way we're recorded ahead so don't

162
00:05:57,139 --> 00:06:00,110
feel offended if I skip your question

163
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:01,670
haven't gotten to your question yet

164
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,629
haven't given you a patreon shoutout

shoutouts coming up if you've paid for a

172
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:15,620

00:06:14,149 --> 00:06:17,779
that part of the business another thing

174
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:19,910
I wanted to mention is today I had the

175
00:06:17,779 --> 00:06:22,729

176

177
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:26,000

185
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:41,269
the grow cat

186
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:43,310
to make sure you download that I think

187
00:06:41,269 --> 00:06:45,740
it is on Spotify I know it's on Apple

188
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:47,930
podcast and I think it's on most of the

189
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:51,079
other podcast servers he did agree to

190
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:53,030

video let me make sure I haven't skipped

276
00:09:38,419 --> 00:09:43,879
any other notes I was on the grow cast

277
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:45,379
ah dude people like the music that we've

278
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:47,659
been playing I've been playing at the

279
00:09:45,379 --> 00:09:49,460
end of the show I don't know if you

280
00:09:47,659 --> 00:09:51,230
watch the shows cuz you're on them and

281
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:53,810
sometimes it feels weird to watch it

282
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:57,769
we're on at the end I'm running like a

283
00:09:53,809 --> 00:09:59,989
clip of it's a slideshow of strains of

284
00:09:57,769 --> 00:10:01,490
just weed pictures and also sometimes I

285
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:02,990
take a DAB and the other day I think I

286
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:04,310
danced around to a Phish song or a

287
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:06,500
Stevie Wonder song for a couple of

288
00:10:04,309 --> 00:10:08,239
seconds and somebody asked me to show my

289
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,259
dreadlocks - I forgot about that I'll

290
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,789
show my dreads in another episode

291
00:10:09,259 --> 00:10:12,590
they're bundled up super tightly today

292
00:10:10,789 --> 00:10:14,569
but I'll show them in another episode at

293
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:16,519
the end but people are impressed with

294
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:18,110
the music that I'm playing at the end of

295
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:20,360
the show unfortunately we've got to quit

296
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:21,889
doing that Spotify doesn't like the

297
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:24,139
music YouTube doesn't like the music

298
00:10:21,889 --> 00:10:26,240
we're getting the this no no no finger

299
00:10:24,139 --> 00:10:29,120
at us the bigger the company the less

300
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,169
cool and the bigger the podcast we've

301
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,269
increased the listens

302
00:10:30,169 --> 00:10:34,219
audio and video listeners have totally

303
00:10:32,269 --> 00:10:35,779
increased by a large amount so we're

304
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:37,519
getting more notices which is getting us

305
00:10:35,779 --> 00:10:39,139
higher up in the rankings which more

306
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:42,079
algorithms are seeing us and now they're

307
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:43,519
messing with our stuff so um I'm no

308
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:45,139
longer going to be able to put cool

309
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,750
music at the end of the show unless

310
00:10:45,139 --> 00:10:49,909
somebody makes me a kickin theme song if

311
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:51,470
you send me music that is original I've

312
00:10:49,909 --> 00:10:52,819
said this before I'll play your track at

313
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:54,740
the starter at the end of the show and

314
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:56,270
you'll get compensated based on how cool

315
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:57,769
your [ __ ] track is and how many times

316
00:10:56,269 --> 00:10:59,329
I decide to play it if you're a

317
00:10:57,769 --> 00:11:01,429
professional and you need money for sure

318
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:02,930
send me a sample if you're kind

319
00:11:01,429 --> 00:11:04,339
send me some tracks so [ __ ] give you

320
00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:05,809
a shout-out I'll say your name and I'll

321
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:07,970
send you gifts in return

322
00:11:05,809 --> 00:11:09,799
but what I was getting to is somebody

323
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:11,389
asked me for a list of the tracks

324
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:13,129
multiple people have asked me what was

325
00:11:11,389 --> 00:11:16,279

328
00:11:18,019 --> 00:11:21,949
of the most recent tracks I've played

329
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:24,259

the full list of tracks because I've got

331
00:11:24,259 --> 00:11:29,689

332
00:11:28,009 --> 00:11:31,490
writing down which songs I was playing

333
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:33,380

334
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:34,940

more like book code and for some people

343
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:54,710

344

what are those four letters in a row

348
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:02,330

349
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:04,250

that I put on there and then through

354
00:12:09,769 --> 00:12:15,379
five oh five through 507 it says [ __ ] I

355
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:17,810
made because those three [ __ ] shows

356
00:12:15,379 --> 00:12:21,200
were tracks that I made so let me just

357
00:12:17,809 --> 00:12:24,349
read will start at five on the back

358
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,640
we start at five twenty seven so 527 was

359
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:27,440
called Fat Freddy's drop

360
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:29,449
I didn't write down details guys so I

361
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,860
may not know either the artist or the

362
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:32,600
track I just wrote down enough to give

363
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:34,399
myself a reminder so that I don't play

364
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,620
that song again for like another ten

365
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:39,350
tracks or whatever so Fat Freddy's drop

366
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:41,360
that was recommended by a friend 528 was

367
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:44,450
a Pearl Jam song don't remember which

368
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,909

373
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:56,299
was the white Mike interview I didn't

374
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:57,860
put music at the end of that because I

375
00:12:56,299 --> 00:12:59,120
think we high-fived each other at the

376
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,860
end or something it sounded cool so I

377
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:04,610
cut that out

378
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:07,580
5:31 got a lot of notice 5:31 is a song

379
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:09,919
called bloodshot eyes sorry for my

380
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:12,530
bloodshot eyes I did not write down the

381
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:14,419
artist I want to say through the roots

382
00:13:12,529 --> 00:13:16,129
but I could be completely wrong with

383
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:19,069
that don't hold me accountable for that

384
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:19,549
but if you google reggae song bloodshot

385
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:21,110
eyes

386
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:23,149
it will come up there a current reggae

387
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:25,278

401
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:59,930

a comment about uh the Beastie Boys

405
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:08,028
taught him that every picture is cooler

406
00:14:06,049 --> 00:14:09,319
if he pointed the camera and so when he

407
00:14:08,028 --> 00:14:10,879
said Beastie Boys at the end of the

408
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,050
video I left that part in he thought I

409
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:13,850
would edit that out cuz the show is

410
00:14:12,049 --> 00:14:15,259

411
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:18,620

498
00:17:19,009 --> 00:17:21,740
sometimes I've talked about projects and

499
00:17:20,689 --> 00:17:23,209
then they failed and I was like oh

500
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:25,130
that's cuz I talked about it I gave it

501
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:26,720
too much like too much energy too much

502
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:28,669

fan and it's just it disappeared it's

525
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:22,669
not like I stopped being a fan it's just

it's not being widely available yeah I

527
00:18:22,669 --> 00:18:27,320

if they're worth a [ __ ] when I grow them

536
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:47,298

605
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:03,090
close your phone and put it away or in

606
00:21:01,528 --> 00:21:04,888
your pocket or something and hear it so

607

Spotify or stitcher or Apple podcast but

609

613
00:21:15,419 --> 00:21:19,109
just takes I had a technical issue and I

614
00:21:17,489 --> 00:21:20,730
do and I didn't know that I knew how to

615
00:21:19,108 --> 00:21:22,199
make an RSS feed and solve issues I

616
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:23,819
[ __ ] did it Matt was sitting here

617
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,259
he's like why aren't you on Spotify and

618
00:21:23,819 --> 00:21:27,720

619
00:21:25,259 --> 00:21:29,368
I could do this I could do that oh I

620
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,960
could do that and within 20 minutes my

621
00:21:29,368 --> 00:21:32,970
[ __ ] was on Spotify I just had to take a

622
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,548
couple dabs and get the idea think about

623
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:37,618

624
00:21:35,548 --> 00:21:38,788
the news and all the crap and the first

625
00:21:37,618 --> 00:21:41,398

628
00:21:43,648 --> 00:21:47,758
housekeeping in the podcast business now

629
00:21:46,259 --> 00:21:49,889
we can actually move on to the

630
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:52,558
educational and entertainment part of

631
00:21:49,888 --> 00:21:55,229
the podcast I like to take questions

632
00:21:52,558 --> 00:21:57,329
from email if you've got a question the

633
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:58,440
best way to get it to me honestly the

634
00:21:57,329 --> 00:22:01,558
best way to get it to me is through

635
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:02,909
patreon um go for the appropriate tier

636
00:22:01,558 --> 00:22:05,128
I've changed the pricing but go for the

637
00:22:02,909 --> 00:22:07,080
question answering tier sign up throw me

638
00:22:05,128 --> 00:22:09,509
a question on patreon the patreon

639
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:11,189
questions go first obviously that's an

640
00:22:09,509 --> 00:22:11,940
expensive ticket to riot you get to the

641
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:12,590
front of the line

642
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:14,450
the next

643
00:22:12,589 --> 00:22:16,730
best way is to send me an email it's

644
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:18,710
grow from your heart at hotmail.com yeah

645
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:20,028
laugh at me cuz it's a hotmail [ __ ]

646
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:21,679
but all the other ones get hacked and

647
00:22:20,028 --> 00:22:23,538
broken into and gmail failed me once and

648
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:25,009
now I'm scared so it's hotmail bro grow

649
00:22:23,538 --> 00:22:27,379
from your heart at hotmail.com we'll get

650
00:22:25,009 --> 00:22:29,240
you right to me I don't remember where I

651
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:30,650
found this question because I didn't

652
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:32,690
print it which makes me think it came

653
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:34,669
from YouTube I love the people comment

654
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:36,380
on YouTube but it's more challenging for

655
00:22:34,669 --> 00:22:38,090
me to print them off because it wants to

656
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:40,130
print the entire YouTube screen unless I

657
00:22:38,089 --> 00:22:42,319
catch it in the email it's difficult I'm

658
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:44,390
not complaining third world prompt first

659
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:45,558
world problems white people problems but

660
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:47,538
if you really want me to get it I

661
00:22:45,558 --> 00:22:48,740
YouTube isn't the place to send it grow

662
00:22:47,538 --> 00:22:50,269
from your heart at hotmail calms the

663
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:52,759
best I did find this one on YouTube I

664
00:22:50,269 --> 00:22:56,839
believe and all I wrote down was do I

665
00:22:52,759 --> 00:22:59,000
question somebody asked me hey Ross -

666
00:22:56,839 --> 00:23:01,819
Jeff why are my plants drooping toward

667
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,349
the end of the day cycle a little bit

668
00:23:01,819 --> 00:23:05,509
before the light cycle might start my

669
00:23:03,349 --> 00:23:06,859
plants my leaves start to droop down do

670
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:08,690
they need water right before they go to

671
00:23:06,859 --> 00:23:10,219
sleep that I do something wrong they

672
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:12,200
were really worried about their plants

673
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:13,370
Mike you look like you might know what's

674
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:16,220
going on with these do you have any

675
00:23:13,369 --> 00:23:19,519
input on this nope oh you look like you

676
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:24,409
really [ __ ] I try because I've seen

677
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:26,148
this before and I'm waiting do you start

678
00:23:24,409 --> 00:23:28,340
to get droopy but toward the end of the

679
00:23:26,148 --> 00:23:30,139
day I do the plants are doing the same

680
00:23:28,339 --> 00:23:31,519
thing I think they'd be pissed if I gave

681
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:33,590
them Red Bull though and that's yeah

682
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:35,629
yeah don't do that give them a nap so

683
00:23:33,589 --> 00:23:38,089
what's happening is they have reached

684
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:39,620
there he's got that mountain dudes going

685
00:23:38,089 --> 00:23:43,389
strong for you people only listening on

686
00:23:39,619 --> 00:23:46,759
audio it's my daily light integral is

687
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:47,990
that means the daily light integral

688
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:49,339
they've had their amount of light that

689
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:52,038
they want for the day your light is

690
00:23:49,339 --> 00:23:54,439
however far away yeah that's basically

691
00:23:52,038 --> 00:23:56,359
it bro they go hey I only want this many

692
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:57,558
you moles per Joule today and that is a

693
00:23:56,359 --> 00:23:59,028
measurement of light don't worry about

694
00:23:57,558 --> 00:24:00,619
pars don't worry about photons what

695
00:23:59,028 --> 00:24:02,089
matters is you moles per Joule and

696
00:24:00,619 --> 00:24:02,989
they've gotten enough so they're

697
00:24:02,089 --> 00:24:04,579
starting to shut down

698
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:06,740
they're going yeah there's no reason for

699
00:24:04,579 --> 00:24:08,418
me to keep [ __ ] photosynthesizing I'm

700
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:09,980
just gonna let my leaves hang I'm gonna

701
00:24:08,419 --> 00:24:11,690
kind of take a rest and start doing the

702
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:13,278
functions that I do during the night

703
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:15,950
cycle and then when the lights shut off

704
00:24:13,278 --> 00:24:17,690
it's a beautiful night time for them so

705
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:19,940
that is why the plants are drooping they

706
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:22,340
could be thirsty but most if it's

707
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:24,830
happening like 15 20 30 minutes before

708
00:24:22,339 --> 00:24:26,549
nighttime they've reached there there'd

709
00:24:24,829 --> 00:24:28,799
be the other symptoms of thirst

710
00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:30,990
yeah exactly be easier to diagnose than

711
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:34,740
this now one thing that does happen in

712
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:36,390
strains bred from my day breaker if

713
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:38,009
that's something they came from the day

714
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:39,780
breaker line cuz I cross stuff straight

715
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:41,730
from day breaker I made a break or f2s

716
00:24:39,779 --> 00:24:44,009
and a few day breaker things I rise was

717
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:46,680
made in that batch so things that come

718
00:24:44,009 --> 00:24:48,629
from a rise also have the potential to

719
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:51,150
make if you get the big leaved

720
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:53,880
phenotypes of crosses that come from a

721
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:55,769
rise those do have the potential to be a

722
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:58,290
little bit droopy just because they're

723
00:24:55,769 --> 00:24:59,940
so big then like the plants don't have

724
00:24:58,289 --> 00:25:02,129
enough energy to keep that giant leaf

725
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:06,960
turgid and upright so it hangs a little

726
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:09,570
tiny bit all the time yeah that [ __ ]

727
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:14,190
got big in the pre 98 bubba kush used to

728
00:25:09,569 --> 00:25:15,509
make ruby yeah and it was just tired

729
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:17,070
it was just like nah bro these leaves

730
00:25:15,509 --> 00:25:18,509
are the leaves are longer than my

731
00:25:17,069 --> 00:25:20,909
[ __ ] foot so they're like I can't

732
00:25:18,509 --> 00:25:22,559
even keep the tip going anymore I was in

733
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:24,180
needed a little bit of plant viagra on

734
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:26,609
the leaves was just tired bro who's just

735
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:28,860
getting a little plant edy I guess but

736
00:25:26,609 --> 00:25:30,779
what I think is happening for the person

737
00:25:28,859 --> 00:25:34,079
who asked me this question is the plants

738
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:36,240
basically need a nap so you could and I

739
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:37,710
don't know the condition of your plants

740
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,650
I don't know how long your lights are on

741
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:42,210
if they are on for 24 hours a day and

742
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:44,280
you're seeing droop toward a certain

743
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:46,350
period of the day give them some night

744
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:49,049
time start introducing some dark to your

745
00:25:46,349 --> 00:25:50,730
plants if you're on an 18-6 maybe not

746
00:25:49,049 --> 00:25:53,039
because then they may be telling you I'm

747
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:54,450
ready to start flowering so be careful

748
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:56,879
start paying attention if they're

749
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:58,620
starting to droop at the end of that day

750
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,390
time they're starting to tell you hey

751
00:25:58,619 --> 00:26:02,219
bro it is almost time for me to start

752
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:04,140
flowering unless you either put me in a

753
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:05,640
bigger pot or something changes they

754
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:06,810
could be starting to get root bound it

755
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,910
could be one of the reasons they'll do

756
00:26:06,809 --> 00:26:10,799
that but it's the daily light integral

757
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:12,540
that is mainly doing that if you put

758
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:14,099
them into flower you also see that

759
00:26:12,539 --> 00:26:15,210
happen toward the end of the flower or

760
00:26:14,099 --> 00:26:17,069
toward the end of the day and flower

761
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:18,539
they will also start to droop you can't

762
00:26:17,069 --> 00:26:20,689
really change the light cycle so you got

763
00:26:18,539 --> 00:26:22,710
to keep them on twelve twelve they're

764
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:24,120
just keep giving them that light they'll

765
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:25,319
pump out those big old fat buds but

766
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:27,509
they've already processed as much as

767
00:26:25,319 --> 00:26:30,329
they can so nothing wrong with your

768
00:26:27,509 --> 00:26:31,890
plants but if they are in small pots and

769
00:26:30,329 --> 00:26:33,240
your vegging it may be time to pop

770
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:35,880
that's the only thing I could recommend

771
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:38,230
but if everything else is in line just

772
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:39,700
enough light you're cool

773
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:41,919
next question let's move right on this

774
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:43,450
one came from patreon like I said before

775
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:45,220
patreon is the best way to get your

776
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:47,080
message onto the show that is the ticket

777
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:49,419
to the front of the line patreon.com

778
00:26:47,079 --> 00:26:51,579
forward slash grow from your heart also

779
00:26:49,419 --> 00:26:54,850
help out my buddy white Mike patreon.com

780
00:26:51,579 --> 00:26:56,619
forward slash white Mike this one came

781
00:26:54,849 --> 00:26:58,509
from patreon it comes from our friend um

782
00:26:56,619 --> 00:27:00,579
I'm gonna straight-up say his name

783
00:26:58,509 --> 00:27:02,379
because he signed it there's a lot of

784
00:27:00,579 --> 00:27:03,939
stuff in I think his name is Craig

785
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:05,530
Compton and he said hey Ross - Jeff I

786
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:07,480

dedication to the plant and the industry

793
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:22,298
they are all a 10 out of 10 so we're

794

to educate and inform and what I really

801
00:27:36,609 --> 00:27:40,928
like is knowing that somebody is getting

802
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:43,929
educated and informed and in light that

803
00:27:40,929 --> 00:27:45,820
feels good like I threw a dart and it I

804
00:27:43,929 --> 00:27:47,470
didn't know where my bull's eye was but

805
00:27:45,819 --> 00:27:49,869
I [ __ ] hit it so that feels really

806
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:52,179
good as somebody an educator a podcaster

807
00:27:49,869 --> 00:27:53,769
a producer a passionate person those

808
00:27:52,179 --> 00:27:56,470
compliments all mean a lot of [ __ ] to me

809
00:27:53,769 --> 00:27:58,599
a lot of good [ __ ] so here's where this

810
00:27:56,470 --> 00:28:00,308
message gets really fun it says I almost

811
00:27:58,599 --> 00:28:01,750
spit my coffee on my windshield the

812
00:28:00,308 --> 00:28:03,460
other day when you said you had to stop

813
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:06,339
listening to your guru because you

814
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:07,960
started talking like him um I don't know

815
00:28:06,339 --> 00:28:09,879
if it was on this podcast or in a live

816
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:12,730
feed or on embracing organics or in

817
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:14,470
another platform for a while I was

818
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:16,690
listening to a guy who was very

819
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:18,250
educational and informative I feel like

820
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:19,720
I've got to educate myself with more

821
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:21,789
knowledgeable people so that I can keep

822
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:23,558
you guys educated I got to get a lot of

823
00:28:21,789 --> 00:28:27,039
education sources so I try to fill my

824
00:28:23,558 --> 00:28:29,048
brain with knowledge I had a [ __ ]

825
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:31,178
bromance in a man-crush on this [ __ ]

826
00:28:29,048 --> 00:28:32,740
weed cultivator that I found you're just

827
00:28:31,179 --> 00:28:35,169
filling my brain with so much great

828
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:37,179
information and I started he's got a

829
00:28:35,169 --> 00:28:39,040
East Coast accent I wasn't talking like

830
00:28:37,179 --> 00:28:41,559
the East Coast accent but I was using

831
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:43,690
his terms and his ideologies way too

832
00:28:41,558 --> 00:28:45,730
much like I caught it infecting

833
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:48,610
affecting my brain affecting with an AI

834
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:50,409
was affecting my brain and my my speech

835
00:28:48,609 --> 00:28:51,759
and my thoughts so I had to stop talking

836
00:28:50,409 --> 00:28:53,230
like i listening to him

837
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:55,150
to cut myself off from it I was like no

838
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:56,440
no more to him for a minute it's like if

839
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:57,610
you listen to the same rapper for a

840
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,809
while you probably if you listen to

841
00:28:57,609 --> 00:29:01,029
Eminem you probably start doing that how

842
00:28:58,809 --> 00:29:02,919
many men start doing the Eminem [ __ ]

843
00:29:01,029 --> 00:29:03,910
eventually if you listen to [ __ ]

844
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,380
whoever use if you listened to Metallica

845
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:07,240
you start playing [ __ ] chin chin chin

846
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:08,620
chin chin chin just too much of that so

847
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:11,650
I had to quit listen to this guy but

848
00:29:08,619 --> 00:29:13,389
this guy says I knew immediately you

849
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:14,980
were talking about keV because I am the

850
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:17,500
same way and it made me bust out

851
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:20,019
laughing that he has the same effect on

852
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:22,000
you as he does me he's talking about

853
00:29:20,019 --> 00:29:23,589
Kevin Joe dree I had to quit listening

854
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,029
to Kevin Joe drew for a while you guys

855
00:29:23,589 --> 00:29:27,699
because I started saying all of his

856
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:29,710
words his glossary his dictionary it all

857
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:31,720
spilled into my brain it wasn't a bad

858
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:33,549
thing but I wanted to be me again and

859
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:35,890
stop being Kevin Joe dree it was [ __ ]

860
00:29:33,549 --> 00:29:38,799
me up so this guy knew right away who I

861
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:41,020
was talking about he says he has the

862
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:42,639
same effect as he does on me I'm very

863
00:29:41,019 --> 00:29:44,200
fortunate to have crossed paths was keV

896
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:51,789
uh try not to let my ego swell too much

897
00:30:50,109 --> 00:30:53,889
I'm getting older and trying to deflate

898
00:30:51,789 --> 00:30:55,420
and understand that ego but it has got

899
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:57,550

902
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:04,190
when the show helps people grow better

903
00:31:02,259 --> 00:31:06,079
like that's the whole point of the show

904
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:11,899
exactly the point of the show I was

905
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:15,109
recently i subjected to some online weed

906
00:31:11,898 --> 00:31:18,739
forums and holyfuck the advice is just

907
00:31:15,109 --> 00:31:21,079
as bad as it was in 97 it's still [ __ ]

908
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:25,669
you must have seen some comments I left

909
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:26,869
on a Facebook forum it's still it still

910
00:31:25,669 --> 00:31:29,389
seems like it's a whole bunch of

911
00:31:26,869 --> 00:31:31,250
mediocre growers giving people advice

912
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:32,898
they know is shitty in hopes that

913
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:36,888
they'll still have a market for their

914
00:31:32,898 --> 00:31:39,319
meds right the advice is that bad and

915
00:31:36,888 --> 00:31:41,119
it's okay that there's people putting

916
00:31:39,319 --> 00:31:42,918
out the right information and it's

917
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:45,378
reaching its target it makes me happy

918
00:31:42,919 --> 00:31:47,809
yes yes it's okay to be a mediocre

919
00:31:45,378 --> 00:31:49,878
grower dude I sucked it growing when I

920
00:31:47,808 --> 00:31:52,638

a little bit and everything you do it

930
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:12,379

uncle's brother tried to put this in his

965
00:33:32,539 --> 00:33:35,539
soil and it worked for him so that'll

966
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:37,700
solve all your problems and I'm like you

967
00:33:35,539 --> 00:33:39,049
just told them to that's gonna kill all

968
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:41,029
the plants like I hope you didn't do

969
00:33:39,049 --> 00:33:43,700
this yet can I reply quicker and get my

970
00:33:41,029 --> 00:33:46,339
word in before you do this and yeah but

971
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:49,220
it worries me like all social media is

972
00:33:46,339 --> 00:33:52,279
pretty toxic right now but the grow

973
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:54,920
forums I got I think it's that the

974
00:33:52,279 --> 00:33:56,990
financial incentive because everybody

975
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:58,910
sort of understands that there's a

976
00:33:56,990 --> 00:34:00,170
limited number of cannabis consumers out

977
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:03,050
there and everybody's selling the same

978
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:04,519
product and if somebody asks you for

979
00:34:03,049 --> 00:34:07,339
advice you're like now set it on fire

980
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:09,349
take it out back and kick it like that

981
00:34:07,339 --> 00:34:10,819
makes your [ __ ] even if it's mediocre a

982
00:34:09,349 --> 00:34:13,398
little bit more I don't know it's just

983
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:15,350
the advice is so bad it's insane the

984
00:34:13,398 --> 00:34:20,719
advice on other topics is usually bad

985
00:34:15,349 --> 00:34:23,089
but it's not and I'm trying to be a

986
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:24,529
positive person folks but it's a good

987
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:26,630
time to vent this drives me crazy

988
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:28,790
somebody posts a picture of a plant it's

989
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:30,740
got a minor problem the first person

990
00:34:28,789 --> 00:34:32,210
says spider mites they don't have spider

991
00:34:30,739 --> 00:34:34,729
mites so now they're paranoid about

992
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:37,849
spider mites second person says thrips

993
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:40,219
third person says bad soil fourth person

994
00:34:37,849 --> 00:34:42,139
says wrong light now this person is

995
00:34:40,219 --> 00:34:43,549
spraying for mites and spraying for

996
00:34:42,139 --> 00:34:45,739
thrips and changing their soil and

997
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:48,230
buying new lights when really it was too

998
00:34:45,739 --> 00:34:50,299
hot well their plant dies because they

999
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:52,849
did 11 things to it on the same yeah and

1000
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:55,700
so I'm like please be careful so guys my

1001
00:34:52,849 --> 00:34:57,199
bottom line my point here if just be

1002
00:34:55,699 --> 00:34:59,569
careful when you're [ __ ] looking

1003
00:34:57,199 --> 00:35:01,669
online for advice like there are a lot

1004
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:03,410
of things that people will say go look

1005
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:05,269
at the pictures of their garden go look

1006
00:35:03,409 --> 00:35:07,399
if they if they can't smell leaves with

1007
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:09,050
a V if they put an F in the word leaves

1008
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:13,460
don't [ __ ] take their advice like

1009
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:16,820
that's it's uh it's easier with other

1010
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:18,740
topics with with cannabis it's it's

1011
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:21,140
still fringy enough that sometimes it's

1012
00:35:18,739 --> 00:35:24,279
hard to tell like proper grammar is not

1013
00:35:21,139 --> 00:35:26,869
always indicative of proper knowledge

1014
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:28,760
it's not quite as obvious it isn't like

1015
00:35:26,869 --> 00:35:30,519
in politics with politics it's quick

1016
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:32,710
when people start talking about

1017
00:35:30,519 --> 00:35:35,889
in law's you're like do you mean repeal

1018
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:37,809
[ __ ] yeah it's a little bit more

1019
00:35:35,889 --> 00:35:40,059
obvious than it is in the cannabis world

1020
00:35:37,809 --> 00:35:42,489
but usually if you pay attention you you

1021
00:35:40,059 --> 00:35:44,289
take a minute and check two or three

1022
00:35:42,489 --> 00:35:47,109
reliable sources you get the info you

1023
00:35:44,289 --> 00:35:48,909
want but just be super careful if it's

1024
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:50,860
you're asking the social media forum

1025
00:35:48,909 --> 00:35:52,269
about a cannabis screen question because

1026
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:54,730
eighty percent of those answers are

1027
00:35:52,269 --> 00:35:56,230
designed to [ __ ] of your plants I don't

1028
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:58,300
know if they're really designed that way

1029
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:59,829
or if they're actually that misinformed

1030
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:02,200
like I would like to hope they're not

1031
00:35:59,829 --> 00:36:03,819
targeting - thank you fail I should move

1032
00:36:02,199 --> 00:36:06,789
forward from ranting about social media

1033
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:09,430
honestly dude social media people

1034
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:11,500
talking about feminized seeds ah

1035
00:36:09,429 --> 00:36:12,639
and such an I think ignorant is the

1036
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:14,230
appropriate word ignorant means

1037
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:16,869
misinformed it's not an insult

1038
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:19,269
they're very ignorant about feminized

1039
00:36:16,869 --> 00:36:22,319
seeds they have frustrated me enough to

1040
00:36:19,269 --> 00:36:26,110
where I am going to do a full Episode on

1041
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:28,690
feminized seeds and detailed on how I

1042
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:30,519
make them so that it's understood so

1043
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:32,440
that people aren't using the wrong terms

1044
00:36:30,519 --> 00:36:36,159
and wrong assumptions I want to correct

1045
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:37,510
it so that's maybe it worked for them

1046
00:36:36,159 --> 00:36:39,940
giving all this terrible advice

1047
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:42,250
frustrated me enough to go okay children

1048
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:43,929
here's how it works it's like if you if

1049
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:45,880
I know that the best way to get one of

1050
00:36:43,929 --> 00:36:49,869
my comedian friends to tell a joke is to

1051
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:52,030
start telling his joke wrong yeah yeah

1052
00:36:49,869 --> 00:36:53,829
like if you're you know I hang out some

1053
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:55,660
of the comedian nerds right so start

1054
00:36:53,829 --> 00:36:56,949
telling it's a good analogy start

1055
00:36:55,659 --> 00:36:57,969
telling one of their bits bro nobody

1056
00:36:56,949 --> 00:37:00,730

1057
00:36:57,969 --> 00:37:02,739
and I just watch them tell their joke

1058
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:06,340

let's get right into another message

1062
00:37:11,139 --> 00:37:14,949

1075
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:41,619
keep it short since you're busy thank

1076
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:43,600
you I do appreciate that first if you

1077
00:37:41,619 --> 00:37:44,230
think your perpetual grow lesson was

1078
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:46,750
worth money

1079
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:49,119
in your breeding lessons was priceless

1080
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:51,429
dude that's awesome thank you I think I

1081
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:53,289
made a joke one time about my perpetual

1082
00:37:51,429 --> 00:37:54,399
grow lesson being worth a million bucks

1083
00:37:53,289 --> 00:37:55,809
or if I wrote a written a book that

1084
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,309
would have been the cash cow right there

1085
00:37:55,809 --> 00:37:59,170
that was old school so you've been

1086
00:37:57,309 --> 00:38:01,358
listening for a while and I'm glad you

1087
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:03,220
enjoyed the breeding labels lesson I

1088
00:38:01,358 --> 00:38:04,929
kind of went over that on to other

1089
00:38:03,219 --> 00:38:06,519
podcasts today we talked about that on

1090
00:38:04,929 --> 00:38:09,219

1091
00:38:06,519 --> 00:38:11,739
that on the grow cast with Jordan River

1092
00:38:09,219 --> 00:38:13,059

00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:28,930
absolute favorite and I will spread the

1101
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:31,840
word about your podcast to anyone who

1102
00:38:28,929 --> 00:38:33,190
will listen my friend I love that ya

1103
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:35,289
don't run off your friends by rambling

1104
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:37,210
too much about it but encourage them so

1105
00:38:35,289 --> 00:38:38,590
it goes on to say I grew in a basement

1106
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:41,230
for about ten years and I had to stop

1107
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:43,720
for six I started again then I started

1108
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:44,980
again I says why he had to stop but I

1109
00:38:43,719 --> 00:38:47,379
don't know if I'm supposed to read that

1110
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:50,800
cuz it's in parenthesis I says now I'm

1111
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:52,869
allegedly in week two of my week to a

1112
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:55,090
flower on my third attempt I've got four

1113
00:38:52,869 --> 00:38:57,070
New York diesel in a four by three tenth

1114
00:38:55,090 --> 00:38:58,809
everything looks good for this one bro

1115
00:38:57,070 --> 00:39:01,900
I've seen your past and I hope this one

1116
00:38:58,809 --> 00:39:04,210
is much more successful nice cross yeah

1117
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:06,369
toes crossed Jah love I am fairly

1118
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:08,139
experienced but this is my first trellis

1119
00:39:06,369 --> 00:39:10,420
grow so they've got a trellis a netting

1120
00:39:08,139 --> 00:39:11,529
system I just installed my second

1121
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:13,329
trellis so they've got a first one

1122
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:15,340
hopefully spreading it the second one

1123
00:39:13,329 --> 00:39:16,929
kind of given it support it says I

1124
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:18,789
listened to all of your scrog lessons

1125
00:39:16,929 --> 00:39:20,230
but I have a quick question all right

1126
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:23,230
this is where the questions come in is

1127
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:25,599
it okay if some of my buds are woven

1128
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:27,789
through the trellis or should I only be

1129
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:29,380
weaving so only the branch material is

1130
00:39:27,789 --> 00:39:31,570
touching the trellis I hope this makes

1131
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:33,250
sense I'm trying to keep the canopy

1132
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:34,990
super low I'm just worried that I'm

1133
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:37,809
keeping some of the buds caught in the

1134
00:39:34,989 --> 00:39:39,729
trellis I work on a 2500 acre fresh

1135
00:39:37,809 --> 00:39:41,559
produce farm but I come home to a four

1136
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:43,570
by three tenth row that is passion right

1137
00:39:41,559 --> 00:39:45,279
there I wish every day that these rows

1138
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:48,550
were golden goat or a lemon Geoffrey

1139
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:49,840
thank you bro I wish you much love shout

1140
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:52,119
out from our friend out there an east

1141
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:55,180
coast prohibition land let's talk about

1142
00:39:52,119 --> 00:39:56,710
this for a minute Mike one of the first

1143
00:39:55,179 --> 00:39:58,029
thing I thought was yeah it's okay

1144
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:59,679
you're gonna get your buds are going

1145
00:39:58,030 --> 00:40:02,019
grow into your trellis occasionally um

1146
00:39:59,679 --> 00:40:03,639
you get the little nodules the stick

1147
00:40:02,019 --> 00:40:04,780
comes up and the bud branches off of

1148
00:40:03,639 --> 00:40:06,670
there and instead of it just growing

1149
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:08,620
straight it happens to catch the part of

1150
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:09,610
this trellis and it just grows around it

1151
00:40:08,619 --> 00:40:10,960
that's fine you're just gonna have to

1152
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:13,240
cut that out at the end of flower be

1153
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,980
careful something that did catch my

1154
00:40:13,239 --> 00:40:17,259
attention though you said that you're

1155
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:19,630
still weaving it through and you're in

1156
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:21,970
flower be very careful doing that if

1157
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:23,980
you're in flower far enough to have

1158
00:40:21,969 --> 00:40:26,500
chunky bud set you should have already

1159
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:30,280
be woven up through there that's part of

1160
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:33,280
what got my attention so I'm gonna read

1161
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:35,140
it again I'm only I only be weaving or

1162
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:37,000
should I only be weaving so only the

1163
00:40:35,139 --> 00:40:41,319
branch material is touching the trellis

1164
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:42,610
um I I read that or I would listen do

1165
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:45,130
you read that it sounded like he was

1166
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:48,579
talking about his setup okay should he

1167
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:50,380
weave it through so that when it starts

1168
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:52,420
to flower out heavily all of the

1169
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:55,269
flowering material is off and it's

1170
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:57,519
mostly stick hitting trellis okay most

1171
00:40:55,269 --> 00:40:59,769
of the time shoot four on the bottom one

1172
00:40:57,519 --> 00:41:01,570
we're going to clean off most of the

1173
00:40:59,769 --> 00:41:05,380
branching and sucker shoots and [ __ ] on

1174
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:06,700
the bottom net that's we clean all the

1175
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:09,099
way that's I kind of use a rule of thumb

1176
00:41:06,699 --> 00:41:11,169
I kind of lean off a lot of there at the

1177
00:41:09,099 --> 00:41:14,139
end of flower because it's too hard to

1178
00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:16,510
get it out before flowering right but

1179
00:41:14,139 --> 00:41:18,639
there shouldn't be buds on the bud

1180
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:20,710
starts right above that like that's I

1181
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:22,119
tell the guys bottom it to the first net

1182
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:23,800
that's kind of the first net goes about

1183
00:41:22,119 --> 00:41:26,049
18 inches high and we bought them up to

1184
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:27,340
there so you got however tall the pot is

1185
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:28,720
and then the rest of that gets kind of

1186
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:31,750
cleaned up so there's no bud down there

1187
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:33,129
ah maybe maybe tiny buds may grow into

1188
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:34,329
your net but that's fine just pull them

1189
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:36,160
right out they're gonna fall off when

1190
00:41:34,329 --> 00:41:37,630
you start pulling it you know when the

1191
00:41:36,159 --> 00:41:38,469
guys run through the grow rooms mic and

1192
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:40,000
at the end of the day we got a bunch of

1193
00:41:38,469 --> 00:41:40,929
little popcorn buds on the floor those

1194
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,820
are the ones that got caught in the net

1195
00:41:40,929 --> 00:41:44,679
those are the little tiny buds that grew

1196
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:47,289
on the wrong side of the fence so your

1197
00:41:44,679 --> 00:41:49,089
second layer a trellis um that is there

1198
00:41:47,289 --> 00:41:50,650
to support the buds so they're gonna be

1199
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:52,300
leaning against that they've got to go

1200
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:53,710
somewhere but I'm toppling over they're

1201
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:54,910
tall they're gonna and so that is when

1202
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:56,230
you get the opportunity for that stick

1203
00:41:54,909 --> 00:41:57,699
to go straight the blood starts growing

1204
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:59,170
up the fences around it and they were

1205
00:41:57,699 --> 00:42:01,539
gonna go on the wrong side of the fence

1206
00:41:59,170 --> 00:42:03,760
yeah that'll be okay that will happen

1207
00:42:01,539 --> 00:42:05,170
that's gonna be hard to prevent you see

1208
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:06,820
where the buds are gonna develop cuz

1209
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:08,680
you've got a chute there but sometimes

1210
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:10,510
you just can't aim it it's the [ __ ]

1211
00:42:08,679 --> 00:42:11,199
happens in a tent you've got a little

1212
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:12,790
more chance

1213
00:42:11,199 --> 00:42:14,379
to control it to need you in a larger

1214
00:42:12,789 --> 00:42:16,269
facility yeah

1215
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:19,210
and when you're talking for six plants

1216
00:42:16,269 --> 00:42:23,858
it's it's easier to to micromanage each

1217
00:42:19,210 --> 00:42:26,349
Cola it's not possible to do it on a 20

1218
00:42:23,858 --> 00:42:27,789
yard table yeah when you cut them down

1219
00:42:26,349 --> 00:42:29,980
you're gonna cut them down to small buds

1220
00:42:27,789 --> 00:42:31,929
anyway nobody wants it's really fun to

1221
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:34,210
look at big old donkey dick buds big old

1222
00:42:31,929 --> 00:42:35,618
bananas big old dildos a weed but I

1223
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:37,329
don't want it like those business

1224
00:42:35,619 --> 00:42:38,588
there's a stick down the middle there's

1225
00:42:37,329 --> 00:42:39,910
a drum stick down the middle I'm not

1226
00:42:38,588 --> 00:42:41,259
trying to buy a five hey drum stick

1227
00:42:39,909 --> 00:42:43,029
along with my weed I'll go to Guitar

1228
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:44,740
Center when I need sticks actually I'll

1229
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:46,750
visit my friends at dope sticks shout

1230
00:42:44,739 --> 00:42:48,098
out to dope sticks I gotta show love to

1231
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:49,690
local drummers and people that support

1232
00:42:48,099 --> 00:42:51,010
you back that's my friend Eric Moore's

1233
00:42:49,690 --> 00:42:53,230
got a drum company that make sticks now

1234
00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:54,579
got a Shum Love but I don't want the big

1235
00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:56,230
buddy you got to cut it down make it

1236
00:42:54,579 --> 00:42:57,490
smaller so in the end of the cycle

1237
00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:58,809
you're kind of down making it smaller

1238
00:42:57,489 --> 00:43:00,639
anyway don't be too worried if it's

1239
00:42:58,809 --> 00:43:03,429
stuck what you can do at harvest time

1240
00:43:00,639 --> 00:43:04,868
you can cut the branch low and so if

1241
00:43:03,429 --> 00:43:06,578
your trellis is at one level and the

1242
00:43:04,869 --> 00:43:08,950
buds growing up through it cut below

1243
00:43:06,579 --> 00:43:12,039
there and just slowly slide down and get

1244
00:43:08,949 --> 00:43:13,868
the trellis net out of there the string

1245
00:43:12,039 --> 00:43:15,579
the plastic line whatever just slowly

1246
00:43:13,869 --> 00:43:17,289
get it out of there go downward and pull

1247
00:43:15,579 --> 00:43:18,730
it out hopefully you got like twelve or

1248
00:43:17,289 --> 00:43:20,108
fourteen inches worth it he won't

1249
00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:21,818
I'm just exaggerating and hoping you the

1250
00:43:20,108 --> 00:43:23,318
best of luck but it's only gonna be a

1251
00:43:21,818 --> 00:43:25,150
couple inches you got a slide down pull

1252
00:43:23,318 --> 00:43:27,159
it out of there maybe that way you won't

1253
00:43:25,150 --> 00:43:29,170
break that bud off of this stick and it

1254
00:43:27,159 --> 00:43:30,759
will still dry and cure properly but

1255
00:43:29,170 --> 00:43:32,380
yeah it's not a big deal it's not a

1256
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:34,900
major issue it's not a problem

1257
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:36,369
it just makes uh harvesting is a little

1258
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:40,420
bit more challenging once you get it

1259
00:43:36,369 --> 00:43:43,119
that way if you can when it comes

1260
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:46,960
harvest time cut the plants out of the

1261
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:49,180
net don't cut the net down all at once

1262
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:51,190
just as a commercial grower with a lot

1263
00:43:49,179 --> 00:43:54,848
of experience Mike's not in his head

1264
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:56,559
because he's seen it so like your net is

1265
00:43:54,849 --> 00:43:59,109
hooked to some supports on the side of

1266
00:43:56,559 --> 00:44:01,989
the table if you cut it free of those

1267
00:43:59,108 --> 00:44:06,219
supports so that the net flops free all

1268
00:44:01,989 --> 00:44:08,318
in one piece it'll [ __ ] up your harvest

1269
00:44:06,219 --> 00:44:10,598
all of your buds will flop free all a

1270
00:44:08,318 --> 00:44:12,068
triple triple your I understand it's

1271
00:44:10,599 --> 00:44:14,019
easier to cut the buds out of the net

1272
00:44:12,068 --> 00:44:15,789
than to cut the net out of the buds to

1273
00:44:14,019 --> 00:44:19,119
tell you the truth and it's yeah it's

1274
00:44:15,789 --> 00:44:21,400
super easy to go piecemeal and be

1275
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:23,650
patient don't don't get rush working

1276
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:25,059
with that net I've seen growers cut

1277
00:44:23,650 --> 00:44:28,570
other growers I've seen growers

1278
00:44:25,059 --> 00:44:31,029
themselves that is when wind [ __ ] goes

1279
00:44:28,570 --> 00:44:35,800
rogue I fall off a ladder once they were

1280
00:44:31,030 --> 00:44:38,620
both holding but this dudes working in a

1281
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:40,630
ladder and his 4x4 tent he's already

1282
00:44:38,619 --> 00:44:42,190
going crazy so we're gonna drug testing

1283
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:44,880
problems we're gonna drug test you if I

1284

catch you in a ladder in there buddy

1285
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:48,340
that was a really good piece of advice

1286
00:44:46,869 --> 00:44:52,420
bring the net down little by little

1287
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:54,490
around the plants knot or if you can get

1288
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:55,990
the plants out of that top layer then

1289
00:44:54,489 --> 00:44:57,609
cut the net out and then take out the

1290
00:44:55,989 --> 00:44:59,079
bottom layer then cut the net you may

1291
00:44:57,610 --> 00:45:00,820
want to recycle that net bro it's like

1292
00:44:59,079 --> 00:45:07,269
eight bucks please just [ __ ] get a

1293
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:09,340
new one yeah reusing that in the pots

1294
00:45:07,269 --> 00:45:12,250
those are the two most brutal things

1295
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:15,130
three is I reuse the pots I take them to

1296
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:17,409
the pots oh don't you you can run the

1297
00:45:15,130 --> 00:45:18,910
cloth pots through the washer at the

1298
00:45:17,409 --> 00:45:20,349
laundry machine don't do them at your

1299
00:45:18,909 --> 00:45:21,940
wife's or your mom's house because she

1300
00:45:20,349 --> 00:45:23,049

1301
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:24,519
laundry machine at the industrial

1302
00:45:23,050 --> 00:45:25,720
washing machines and you can run those

1303
00:45:24,519 --> 00:45:27,969
cloth pots through there and get one or

1304
00:45:25,719 --> 00:45:29,169
two uses out of them they're cheap and

1305
00:45:27,969 --> 00:45:30,399
affordable but some of you guys are

1306
00:45:29,170 --> 00:45:32,889
using the more expensive ones with the

1307
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:35,019
zippers go wash those take your plastic

1308
00:45:32,889 --> 00:45:36,519
pots too if you're in a legal state and

1309
00:45:35,019 --> 00:45:39,730
it's not sketchy take them to the car

1310
00:45:36,519 --> 00:45:41,469
wash just spray em down yeah if you can

1311
00:45:39,730 --> 00:45:43,240
get that thing that holds the floor mats

1312
00:45:41,469 --> 00:45:44,559
in place on the wall clip them into that

1313
00:45:43,239 --> 00:45:45,969
spray the [ __ ] out of them and clip them

1314
00:45:44,559 --> 00:45:46,659
in and spray em yeah because when you

1315
00:45:45,969 --> 00:45:47,919
put them on the floor they're gonna

1316
00:45:46,659 --> 00:45:49,149
slide away put them up against the wall

1317
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:50,860
or put your foot on them or something

1318
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:52,329

1320
00:45:52,329 --> 00:45:56,170
detergent just do the hot water rinse

1321
00:45:53,889 --> 00:45:58,839
and spray for a couple seconds before

1322
00:45:56,170 --> 00:46:00,670
you start uh so in case there's soap in

1323
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:02,530
the wine spray for a few seconds until

1324
00:46:00,670 --> 00:46:04,119
the water unclear yeah spray the line

1325
00:46:02,530 --> 00:46:06,190
clear until the water runs hot and clear

1326
00:46:04,119 --> 00:46:08,769
yeah you don't want car wash in your

1327
00:46:06,190 --> 00:46:10,360
plants and if you are in a sketchy area

1328
00:46:08,769 --> 00:46:12,099
and you need to wash them out the car

00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:13,660
wash put them in the back of the truck

1330
00:46:12,099 --> 00:46:15,039
face-up like you're gonna load them and

1331
00:46:13,659 --> 00:46:16,210
then drive up to the car wash and then

1332
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:17,440

1379
00:47:55,210 --> 00:47:58,599
is I have a quick question though this

1380
00:47:56,889 --> 00:48:01,269
community I thought this community could

1381
00:47:58,599 --> 00:48:03,400
help I switched over and a rise five

1382
00:48:01,269 --> 00:48:04,960
days ago two twelve twelve so they've

1383
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:08,470
put it into flour they're twelve hours

1384
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:09,730
on a twelve hours all our it's in it's

1385
00:48:08,469 --> 00:48:11,949
in the flowering cycle because the

1386
00:48:09,730 --> 00:48:14,349
question is is there a specific point

1387
00:48:11,949 --> 00:48:16,269
specific that's the word specific point

1388
00:48:14,349 --> 00:48:18,519
not Pacific I meant to say specific is

1389
00:48:16,269 --> 00:48:21,369
there a specific point that would show

1390
00:48:18,519 --> 00:48:23,619
sex first I did top it so with the

1391
00:48:21,369 --> 00:48:26,559
pistols are sacks Chilam higher on the

1392
00:48:23,619 --> 00:48:30,579
plant or lower or is this all random

1393
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:32,049
thanks guys um how long ago did you top

1394
00:48:30,579 --> 00:48:34,750
it before you put it in the flower I'm

1395
00:48:32,050 --> 00:48:36,850
hoping you gave it 7/10 maybe 14 days to

1396
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:38,590
recover so that the auxins and

1397
00:48:36,849 --> 00:48:40,750
cytokinins can run back to the tips of

1398
00:48:38,590 --> 00:48:43,390
the plants and [ __ ] choose I try to

1399
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:45,039
fight over apical dominance I hope you

1400
00:48:43,389 --> 00:48:47,650
did that too late to [ __ ] worry about

1401
00:48:45,039 --> 00:48:48,789
it at this point I'm not gonna make too

1402
00:48:47,650 --> 00:48:50,079
big of a difference would have gotten

1403
00:48:48,789 --> 00:48:52,119
bigger fatter bloods had you let it

1404
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:54,369
recover um

1405
00:48:52,119 --> 00:48:56,709
at first I thought they were asking what

1406
00:48:54,369 --> 00:48:59,680
time frame it will show sex and I was

1407
00:48:56,708 --> 00:49:02,379
going to say ten for location and what

1408
00:48:59,679 --> 00:49:04,719
yeah location what specific point on the

1409
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:06,519
plant will it show sex look at the very

1410
00:49:04,719 --> 00:49:09,489
tops I think the tops are going to be

1411
00:49:06,518 --> 00:49:12,818
the most indicative points of the plan

1412
00:49:09,489 --> 00:49:14,259
to find sex so you'll start seeing if

1413
00:49:12,818 --> 00:49:16,179
it's a female you'll start getting the

1414
00:49:14,259 --> 00:49:17,739
little pistols coming out if it's a male

1415
00:49:16,179 --> 00:49:19,268
you'll start seeing little nubs and

1416
00:49:17,739 --> 00:49:22,989
eventually those nubs will turn into

1417
00:49:19,268 --> 00:49:24,818
little ball sacks so the top is probably

1418
00:49:22,989 --> 00:49:26,739
the best place to look or if you've got

1419
00:49:24,818 --> 00:49:28,838
an area that's getting really shaded

1420
00:49:26,739 --> 00:49:30,938
that area may develop into flour more

1421
00:49:28,838 --> 00:49:32,288
quickly sometimes the male plants will

1422
00:49:30,938 --> 00:49:34,058
show you a little lower down they'll

1423
00:49:32,289 --> 00:49:35,559
start popping off just one or two sacks

1424
00:49:34,059 --> 00:49:37,209
that are really extended because they're

1425
00:49:35,559 --> 00:49:40,119
trying to reach for the light but

1426
00:49:37,208 --> 00:49:42,958
typically the tops are going to be where

1427
00:49:40,119 --> 00:49:45,309
you're going to see sex first because um

1428
00:49:42,958 --> 00:49:46,808
the male plants grow taller here's a

1429
00:49:45,309 --> 00:49:48,339
weird thing in my opinion what I've

1430
00:49:46,809 --> 00:49:50,619
experienced the male plants generally

1431
00:49:48,338 --> 00:49:52,478
grow taller than all of the females um

1432
00:49:50,619 --> 00:49:54,309
they'll get to-- so if you've got a

1433
00:49:52,478 --> 00:49:56,048
batch of the same strain a batch of

1434
00:49:54,309 --> 00:49:58,660
whatever seeds golden goat seeds that's

1435
00:49:56,048 --> 00:50:00,248
not a good [ __ ] selection cuz that's

1436
00:49:58,659 --> 00:50:02,259
a feminized we needs a blue raspberry

1437
00:50:00,248 --> 00:50:05,318
truffle we got blue raspberry truffle

1438
00:50:02,259 --> 00:50:07,119
the males typically grow just a ratio

1439
00:50:05,318 --> 00:50:08,409
taller I don't know what size pots are

1440
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:09,969
using but it's gonna be noticeably

1441
00:50:08,409 --> 00:50:12,159
taller because they're gonna make pollen

1442
00:50:09,969 --> 00:50:14,528
now Paula needs to fall down on to the

1443
00:50:12,159 --> 00:50:16,509
females so the tops are usually where we

1444
00:50:14,528 --> 00:50:18,099
start getting that that's the one where

1445
00:50:16,509 --> 00:50:19,838
they want to put their pollination parts

1446
00:50:18,099 --> 00:50:21,189
their sex glands go up to the top so

1447
00:50:19,838 --> 00:50:23,048
they can catch that Paul and if it was

1448
00:50:21,188 --> 00:50:24,670
down lower it would get intercepted by

1449
00:50:23,048 --> 00:50:26,829
leaves or get blown away by the wind by

1450
00:50:24,670 --> 00:50:28,688
the time I got to it so the tips or

1451
00:50:26,829 --> 00:50:30,489
that's where their vaginas are the

1452
00:50:28,688 --> 00:50:31,838
vaginas are on the tips mainly it's

1453
00:50:30,489 --> 00:50:34,659
where they start off first so wants to

1454
00:50:31,838 --> 00:50:35,708
get pollinated up there so ah that's

1455
00:50:34,659 --> 00:50:37,268
that's something to think about if you

1456
00:50:35,708 --> 00:50:39,639
guys are checking for males and females

1457
00:50:37,268 --> 00:50:41,288
quite often not a hundred percent true

1458
00:50:39,639 --> 00:50:42,670
sometimes it's Fino typical sometimes

1459
00:50:41,289 --> 00:50:44,679
you get some mutants and some freaks and

1460
00:50:42,670 --> 00:50:46,269
some champions but usually if you run a

1461
00:50:44,679 --> 00:50:48,160
pack of seeds those plants they get

1462
00:50:46,268 --> 00:50:50,228
super tall right away or generally gonna

1463
00:50:48,159 --> 00:50:52,420
be boys don't get to it so I was the

1464
00:50:50,228 --> 00:50:53,978
urban legend and the more we ran I

1465
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:57,009
thought that was funny that one held

1466
00:50:53,978 --> 00:50:58,748
true yeah I kind of believed it from the

1467
00:50:57,009 --> 00:51:00,699
beginning because it's got a reason

1468
00:50:58,748 --> 00:51:04,178
there's like a reason in nature in a

1469
00:51:00,699 --> 00:51:05,309
sense yeah it's if that's not actually

1470
00:51:04,179 --> 00:51:08,820
true that's

1471
00:51:05,309 --> 00:51:10,650
it's true as [ __ ] he's true in my

1472
00:51:08,820 --> 00:51:12,420
experience for sure yeah oh the boys

1473
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:13,920
want to get up there and drop Pauling

1474
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:16,530
down if the boys are lower you can't

1475
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:19,430
pollinate the top bud you and the short

1476
00:51:16,530 --> 00:51:22,560
guys ever get to [ __ ] the tall chicks

1477
00:51:19,429 --> 00:51:24,960
the first couple times I pop seeds I got

1478
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:27,690
really excited over the you know the

1479
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:29,539
super vigorous one yes in each time it

1480
00:51:27,690 --> 00:51:32,099
was like oh man

1481
00:51:29,539 --> 00:51:34,139
one you know ten days in the flower you

1482
00:51:32,099 --> 00:51:36,210
come in it's like oh man that plants got

1483
00:51:34,139 --> 00:51:37,710
a hard-on I tell a lot of people like

1484
00:51:36,210 --> 00:51:39,539
that when you're excited about it's

1485
00:51:37,710 --> 00:51:41,159
gonna be a boy like don't say that I can

1486
00:51:39,539 --> 00:51:42,719
already it's not I'm not jinxing you

1487
00:51:41,159 --> 00:51:44,069
it's it's a [ __ ] dude that's why it's

1488
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:50,789
a foot taller than the rest it's why

1489
00:51:44,070 --> 00:51:54,090
it's more vigorous yeah I'm gonna move

1490
00:51:50,789 --> 00:51:55,949
on from that it's 2020 Mike this was a

1491
00:51:54,090 --> 00:51:57,750
fun podcast we've been going for like I

1492
00:51:55,949 --> 00:51:59,279
think close to an hour dude I wrote it

1493
00:51:57,750 --> 00:52:00,059
down on another page of notes and I

1494
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:01,710
don't know where it went

1495
00:52:00,059 --> 00:52:04,380
yeah do we've been gone for close to an

1496
00:52:01,710 --> 00:52:05,579
hour so yeah yeah let's start wrapping

1497
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:07,860
up this show brought a good time with

1498
00:52:05,579 --> 00:52:10,110
you yeah the people deserve this I think

1499
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:11,820
uh the last episode I was off my game

1500
00:52:10,110 --> 00:52:13,200
dude I watch it again and as like it's

1501
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:15,630
not as bad as I felt like it was but I

1502
00:52:13,199 --> 00:52:17,399
was just a little bit off my crackers we

1503
00:52:15,630 --> 00:52:19,380
might want to look at the last episode

1504
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:22,440
we recorded we talked about being a

1505
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:24,030
little fair a little recorded ahead in

1506
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:27,329
this episode so I don't feel like we're

1507
00:52:24,030 --> 00:52:30,000
giving away any movie magic secrets but

1508
00:52:27,329 --> 00:52:37,500
we were in rare form for an episode

1509
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:39,119
folks if you enjoyed it there wasn't

1510
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:41,219
much editing to be done but we were I

1511
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:42,719
think we may have had too many dabs for

1512
00:52:41,219 --> 00:52:45,899
a podcast that night dude

1513
00:52:42,719 --> 00:52:47,789
mind if we got we we got carried away

1514
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:49,530
before the show a little bit and it was

1515
00:52:47,789 --> 00:52:53,269
