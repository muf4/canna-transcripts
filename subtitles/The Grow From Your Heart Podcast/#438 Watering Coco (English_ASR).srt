14
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:50,070
overwhelming all at once when you take a

15
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:51,719
DAB the raspberry flavor just coats your

16
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:53,488
face then there's a sweet sugary

17
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:55,649
aftertaste that sticks around for quite

big shout out to my new friend Brett up

44
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,860
in Canada the message goes on it says

45
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:16,590
aside from dabbing a little as a team

46
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:19,230
I am new to cannabis use just prior to

47
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:20,430
full Canadian legalization following a

48
00:02:19,229 --> 00:02:22,079
brain injury with the host of

49
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:24,960
side-effects I will not get into I

50
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,150
started using cannabis medicinally hey I

51
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:29,670
used cannabis long before I had a

52
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:32,189
traumatic brain injury then I had a life

53
00:02:29,669 --> 00:02:34,079
disrupting traumatic brain injury and I

54
00:02:32,189 --> 00:02:36,329
have continued to use cannabis and I see

55
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,130
the effects from what I am able to

56
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:39,840
medicate properly from what I am not

57
00:02:38,129 --> 00:02:41,909
able to medicate properly I can tell

58
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,219
that cannabis does help with the effects

59
00:02:41,909 --> 00:02:46,469
and/or side effects of my traumatic

60
00:02:44,219 --> 00:02:48,000
brain injury and the recovery so I do

61
00:02:46,469 --> 00:02:49,530
understand that it works for you and I

62
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,030
am a believer and I hope things are

63
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:52,500
going well let's keep going with this

64
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:54,870
message because it's not about me it

65
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:57,030
says without question cannabis has been

66
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:59,189
the single best medicine I have used for

67
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:01,650
my issues with no side effects from its

68
00:02:59,189 --> 00:03:03,810
use I have become a firm believer and

69
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:06,300
advocate of this plant and its value as

70
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:08,699
medicine and as a recreational herb

71
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:11,100
let's be honest when you don't feel good

72
00:03:08,699 --> 00:03:14,488
most of the time it feels amazing to get

73
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:17,069
some relief even if for a few hours

74
00:03:14,489 --> 00:03:19,650
I completely understand and agree with

75
00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:21,209
everything that you just said when you

76
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:23,159
don't feel good it's hard to enjoy a

77
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:24,269
life it's hard to be around people it's

78
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:26,489
hard to do the things that you would

79
00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:28,319
normally enjoy so it makes normal life a

80
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:30,659
struggle just not feeling good so

81
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,579
finding relief through cannabis can put

82
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:34,979
you back into your normal daily routine

83
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:37,290
put you back on our rhythm and put you

84
00:03:34,979 --> 00:03:39,479
back in the position to enjoy your life

85
00:03:37,289 --> 00:03:41,489
now something I really like that our new

86
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:44,340
friend Brett said is that he believes in

87
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:48,539
the medicinal and recreational powers of

88
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:51,569
cannabis I think that almost all

89
00:03:48,539 --> 00:03:54,209
cannabis in a way can be labeled as some

90
00:03:51,569 --> 00:03:57,120
sort of medical or therapeutic use of

91
00:03:54,209 --> 00:03:59,340
cannabis it makes you feel better I

92
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,739
can't speak for everybody but in most

93
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:03,509
cases cannabis makes you feel better and

94
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:05,519
there is a point that if you consume too

95
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:08,280
much cannabis it will make you feel

96
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,650
worse or like [ __ ] so it works as any

97
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,590
other medicine would but I think that

98
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:14,700
any use of cannabis can be considered

99
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:16,620
recreational if we're just sitting here

100
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:18,298
at the table and I decide hey you want

101
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,780
to smoke a joint with me and we smoke a

102
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:21,029
joint

103
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:23,159
we feel better we might have felt just

104
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:25,409
fine before we smoked but we feel even

105
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,680
better after so that is medicinal that

106
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:29,180
is therapeutic that makes you feel

107
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,470
better why would you not want to do

108
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:32,209
something that makes you feel better

109
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:34,850
even if you felt just fine before you

110
00:04:32,209 --> 00:04:36,769
improved upon feeling just fine now you

111
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:38,600
feel [ __ ] excellent why wouldn't you

112
00:04:36,769 --> 00:04:40,579
want to do that so I think that is

113
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,650
medicinal that is therapeutic now think

114
00:04:40,579 --> 00:04:44,599
about if you start in pain you normally

115
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:46,849
start at zero right feeling just fine as

116
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,800
a zero feeling pretty cool as a 1

117
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:50,840
feeling great is like a five feeling

118
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,460
[ __ ] stoned his [ __ ] is like a 10

119
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:54,649
right now you got the other way to go

120
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:56,269
maybe when you wake up your back hurts

121
00:04:54,649 --> 00:04:57,649
your neck hurts maybe you got some sort

122
00:04:56,269 --> 00:04:59,149
of debilitating condition where

123
00:04:57,649 --> 00:05:01,788
everything hurts and you're already

124
00:04:59,149 --> 00:05:04,129
starting off at negative 7 you've

125
00:05:01,788 --> 00:05:06,529
already got a happiness and a comfort

126
00:05:04,129 --> 00:05:08,120
and a level of enjoyment deficit you can

127
00:05:06,529 --> 00:05:10,489
only enjoy life so much if you already

128
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:12,530
started off at negative 7 so it's time

129
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:14,990
to consume something smoke a couple of

130
00:05:12,529 --> 00:05:17,478
dabs eat an edible maybe rub some cream

131
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:20,000
on there maybe take some t-shirt however

132
00:05:17,478 --> 00:05:21,918
you get your CBD and or THC into your

133
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,620
body when you do that maybe you can take

134
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:26,149
that negative 7 to a negative 5 maybe we

135
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:28,310
can get that down to a negative 2

136
00:05:26,149 --> 00:05:30,288
hopefully we can dial in your treatment

137
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:32,360
along with your diet and your medical

138
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:34,189
cannabis intake maybe a few other things

139
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,720
to hone in your health and hopefully we

140
00:05:34,189 --> 00:05:37,158
can get you to a zero and then

141
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,510
eventually start turning you the other

142
00:05:37,158 --> 00:05:41,029
way and get you on the positive side

143
00:05:38,509 --> 00:05:42,829
again so anyway that cannabis is

144
00:05:41,029 --> 00:05:44,809
improving the quality of your life or

145
00:05:42,829 --> 00:05:46,550
allowing you to enjoy life a little more

146
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:49,310
I find that to be medicinal or

147
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:51,199
therapeutic we can see physical pain we

148
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:54,379
can see a lot of diseases and ailments

149
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:56,810
but mental health you can't see being in

150
00:05:54,379 --> 00:05:58,639
pain all day not being able to live your

151
00:05:56,810 --> 00:06:01,158
normal life because you were slowed down

152
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:03,590
by pain or a condition will wear on you

153
00:06:01,158 --> 00:06:05,538
mentally that will wear you out being

154
00:06:03,589 --> 00:06:07,668
able to smoke down and first of all

155
00:06:05,538 --> 00:06:09,709
relieve that physical pain will allow

156
00:06:07,668 --> 00:06:11,060
your brain to enjoy life a little bit

157
00:06:09,709 --> 00:06:12,168
you don't have to think about how bad it

158
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:14,509
hurts you don't have to think about

159
00:06:12,168 --> 00:06:16,698
protecting that sore spot you can kind

160
00:06:14,509 --> 00:06:18,620
of chill out and enjoy so first of all

161
00:06:16,699 --> 00:06:21,110
the pain will melt away a little bit

162
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:23,269
second you'll forget about it third

163
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:25,340
you'll be able to just relax and enjoy

164
00:06:23,269 --> 00:06:27,348
yourself you've now escaped that trap

165
00:06:25,339 --> 00:06:29,329
that was pain or that ailment that was

166
00:06:27,348 --> 00:06:31,819
bothering you it's a little bit freeing

167
00:06:29,329 --> 00:06:33,859
and that's the part a lot of people may

168
00:06:31,819 --> 00:06:35,240
overlook or may not see we can see when

169
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:37,098
someone's walking funny or grabbing

170
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:39,050
their hip or making a funny face because

171
00:06:37,098 --> 00:06:40,550
their back hurts but we can't see what

172
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:41,408
you're going through from being in pain

173
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:43,718
all day so

174
00:06:41,408 --> 00:06:45,938
a little smoke a little relief goes a

175
00:06:43,718 --> 00:06:48,788
long way we can call all of that

176
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:50,830
consumption medical or therapeutic all

177
00:06:48,788 --> 00:06:52,838
right I am rambly today I'm gonna blame

178
00:06:50,829 --> 00:06:54,278
it on those dabs there is more to this

179
00:06:52,838 --> 00:06:56,978
email let's get back into it

180
00:06:54,278 --> 00:06:59,079
it goes a lot like this I have decided

181
00:06:56,978 --> 00:07:02,019
to grow my own after spending more than

182
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:03,938
I can afford from licensed producers I'm

183
00:07:02,019 --> 00:07:05,439
now working on my second grow after

184
00:07:03,939 --> 00:07:08,229
harvesting a decent yield and quality

185
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:11,229
legal product and making my own oil

186
00:07:08,228 --> 00:07:12,758
infusions I am using Auto flours and I

187
00:07:11,228 --> 00:07:14,800
admit this knowing how you feel about

188
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:16,989
them a lot of times I have talked trash

189
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,489
about Auto flowers but I have found that

190
00:07:16,988 --> 00:07:20,528
they work for people and if they have

191
00:07:18,488 --> 00:07:22,448
their application use them that's why

192
00:07:20,528 --> 00:07:24,038
they are there use them to the best of

193
00:07:22,449 --> 00:07:26,110
your advantage if that is what you want

194
00:07:24,038 --> 00:07:29,199
to do I am going to be more diplomatic

195
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:30,729
toward my auto flower growing friends if

196
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,288
you're gonna buy Auto flower seeds big

197
00:07:30,728 --> 00:07:33,868
shout out to my friend it Mephisto

198
00:07:32,288 --> 00:07:36,098
genetics let's keep going with a message

199
00:07:33,869 --> 00:07:36,699
he says I thought this was a good idea

200
00:07:36,098 --> 00:07:38,978
at the time

201
00:07:36,699 --> 00:07:40,869
remember I've got brain damage and he

202
00:07:38,978 --> 00:07:42,728
goes on to say but after listening to

203
00:07:40,869 --> 00:07:45,249
your podcast I am very interested in

204
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:46,838
running regular photoperiod seeds as

205
00:07:45,249 --> 00:07:48,669
much as I would like to run your

206
00:07:46,838 --> 00:07:51,129
genetics for this I'm afraid ordering

207
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:53,649
from the USA may cause more grief than

208
00:07:51,129 --> 00:07:55,479
I'd like in the long run potentially

209
00:07:53,649 --> 00:07:57,129
getting me banned from your country is

210
00:07:55,478 --> 00:07:59,318
there a chance that your genetics will

211
00:07:57,129 --> 00:08:01,629
make it to a distributor in Canada that

212
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:03,669
I could then order you know I do not

213
00:08:01,629 --> 00:08:05,519
have any plans for a Canadian

214
00:08:03,668 --> 00:08:08,168
distributor any time in the near future

215
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:10,478
but I can suggest you check with seeds

216
00:08:08,168 --> 00:08:12,448
here now calm and see if they are able

217
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:15,008
to help you out in any way shape or form

218
00:08:12,449 --> 00:08:17,649
now this is the part of the email where

219
00:08:15,009 --> 00:08:19,869
we get to the question it says also I am

220
00:08:17,649 --> 00:08:21,968
growing in Coco I've listened and

221
00:08:19,869 --> 00:08:24,489
understand your level of watering but

222
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:26,978
what I can't find information on is when

223
00:08:24,488 --> 00:08:28,748
to begin watering to run off I get

224
00:08:26,978 --> 00:08:30,848
concerned about nutrient buildup in the

225
00:08:28,749 --> 00:08:32,918
Coco but I also don't want to over water

226
00:08:30,848 --> 00:08:35,528
a plant without a root mask that can

227
00:08:32,918 --> 00:08:37,899
handle that much water I want to get the

228
00:08:35,528 --> 00:08:40,000
most out of my plant genetics but I feel

229
00:08:37,899 --> 00:08:42,099
that I'm holding them back by waiting

230
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,879
too long to be sure they can handle a

231
00:08:42,099 --> 00:08:47,680
runoff watering any tips would be

232
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:49,600
appreciated okay I do have some great

233
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:50,979
tips for you before we get there let's

234
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,569
talk about the comment where you said

235
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:54,819
you have listened and understand my

236
00:08:52,568 --> 00:08:55,269
levels of watering I think what this

237
00:08:54,818 --> 00:08:58,209
person

238
00:08:55,269 --> 00:09:00,610
referring to is episode 337 which is

239
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:01,930
titled one through five watering tech so

240
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:03,850
if you guys would like to catch up with

241
00:09:01,929 --> 00:09:06,849
that I highly suggest you listen to

242
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:09,490
episode 337 and understand one through

243
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:12,190
five watering tech now let's get into

244
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:14,110
the suggestion portion when I am

245
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:16,600
watering plants in Cocoa I like to

246
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:20,230
achieve about ten to twenty percent

247
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:22,000
runoff with each watering so what that

248
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:24,159
means is I need to water that plant

249
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,559
until that Coco is saturated and

250
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:29,169
continue to water until I get twenty

251
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:31,239
percent excess water coming out of the

252
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:32,379
bottom of my container there are a

253
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,360
couple of reasons

254
00:09:32,379 --> 00:09:36,759
to water your Coco this way but the main

255
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:38,800
reason is to make sure that you don't

256
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:40,600
have any salts or nutrients from

257
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:43,449
previous waterings built up in your

258
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:45,580
medium in most cases we are feeding the

259
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:47,680
plants more salt than they can take up

260
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:49,600
there's going to be a buildup in the

261
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:52,029
root zone if we just keep adding more

262
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,700
salts in and nothing runs off out the

263
00:09:52,029 --> 00:09:57,519
bottom we will get a heavy saturation of

264
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:59,710
salt based minerals in our medium that

265
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:02,259
heavy saturation of salt based minerals

266
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:04,330
will disrupt the pH of our root zone it

267
00:10:02,259 --> 00:10:06,009
will disrupt the uptake of our plants we

268
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:07,900
will see nutrient lock out we will see

269
00:10:06,009 --> 00:10:09,490
nutrient problems we will see plants

270
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:11,529
that start changing colors we will see

271
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:13,299
plants to start slowing down we will not

272
00:10:11,529 --> 00:10:15,850
reach our harvest goals and we will not

273
00:10:13,299 --> 00:10:17,829
reach our potency expectations so that

274
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:20,110
is one of the main reasons why we like

275
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:22,900
to water our plants to runoff when using

276
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:25,060
Coco as a medium now something I should

277
00:10:22,899 --> 00:10:26,889
touch on before we go too far is if you

278
00:10:25,059 --> 00:10:29,049
are going to saturate your Coco that

279
00:10:26,889 --> 00:10:31,210
heavily it is a good idea to amend it

280
00:10:29,049 --> 00:10:33,429
with some sort of aeration product I

281
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:37,120
like to put perlite and personal light

282
00:10:33,429 --> 00:10:40,059
both in my cocoa mix in most commercial

283
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:43,149
environments I prefer to run a three

284
00:10:40,059 --> 00:10:46,269
gallon fabric pot I fill those fabric

285
00:10:43,149 --> 00:10:50,980
pots with a perlite Percel light and

286
00:10:46,269 --> 00:10:55,659
coco coir mix in most situations I use

287
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:58,269
20% perlite 20% personal light and 60%

288
00:10:55,659 --> 00:10:59,829
cocoa in some situations I will adjust

289
00:10:58,269 --> 00:11:01,299
that mix depending on the environment

290
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:03,009
depending on the growers in that

291
00:11:01,299 --> 00:11:05,529
facility depending on the genetics in

292
00:11:03,009 --> 00:11:08,289
that facility but in some situations I

293
00:11:05,529 --> 00:11:09,129
will do fifteen percent perlite fifteen

294
00:11:08,289 --> 00:11:12,370
percent perlite

295
00:11:09,129 --> 00:11:14,470
and 70% cocoa some of those decisions

296
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:16,509
are based on genetics again some of

297
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:19,090
those are based on the facility and some

298
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:21,340
are based on the growers and also those

299
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:23,290
are based on schedules if I use a little

300
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:26,139
bit less perlite and personal light I do

301
00:11:23,289 --> 00:11:27,610
get a little longer wet and dry time so

302
00:11:26,139 --> 00:11:30,100
the plants don't need to be watered as

303
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:31,480
frequently but if you were using cocoa

304
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:34,300
and you're going to water it's a full

305
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:36,909
saturation to get runoff I do recommend

306
00:11:34,299 --> 00:11:38,769
some sort of aeration product in there

307
00:11:36,909 --> 00:11:40,929
perlite and personal light are always my

308
00:11:38,769 --> 00:11:42,939
go-to I like the way they fluff up that

309
00:11:40,929 --> 00:11:45,549
cocoa and they don't add anything to my

310
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:47,560
mix and if we're gonna talk about cocoa

311
00:11:45,549 --> 00:11:48,819
one more thing I should mention I don't

312
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:50,169
know what brand of cocoa you're

313
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,560
purchasing I don't know where it comes

314
00:11:50,169 --> 00:11:52,329
from

315
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:55,179
no matter what it is I do recommend

316
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:58,060
giving it a rinse when you buy bags of

317
00:11:55,179 --> 00:12:00,039
cocoa it can be very salty I have seen

318
00:11:58,059 --> 00:12:02,349
people use bagged cocoa straight out of

319
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:03,879
the bag into the pot put a plan in it

320
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:05,560
feed it throw it in the grow room and

321
00:12:03,879 --> 00:12:07,929
watch that plant turn to [ __ ] because

322
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:10,000
they did not rinse the excess salt out

323
00:12:07,929 --> 00:12:11,439
of that bag - cocoa I don't know where

324
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,669
your cocoa is coming from I don't know

325
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,500
how it was shipped i don't know how it

326
00:12:12,669 --> 00:12:17,529
was stored but i do know that a lot of

327
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:20,350
times there is a large buildup of salt

328
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:21,759
in a lot of store-bought cocoa so rinse

329
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:24,190
that out if you've got the opportunity

330
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:26,439
if you've got an EC meter fill up a

331
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:28,600
large container with water test the EC

332
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:30,250
of that water test the pH of that water

333
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,710
if you have the ability mark those two

334
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:35,139
things down fill a small container with

335
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:37,150
cocoa then water that container until

336
00:12:35,139 --> 00:12:39,129
you get run off gather some of that

337
00:12:37,149 --> 00:12:41,740
runoff water in a clean container and

338
00:12:39,129 --> 00:12:43,899
test it what is the pH what is the TDS

339
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:46,180
what is the EC of that runoff water if

340
00:12:43,899 --> 00:12:48,069
it is really high you need to clean that

341
00:12:46,179 --> 00:12:51,129
cocoa before you put your plants in it

342
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:52,540
because it will fry your plants now it

343
00:12:51,129 --> 00:12:54,399
doesn't sound like our friend Brett is

344
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:55,779
having a salt issue I just wanted to

345
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,029
make sure to mention that let's get back

346
00:12:55,779 --> 00:12:59,649
on track let's have faith in Brett that

347
00:12:58,029 --> 00:13:01,659
he rinsed out his medium so we know he's

348
00:12:59,649 --> 00:13:03,279
got some nice clean cocoa let's also

349
00:13:01,659 --> 00:13:05,169
trust that he put plenty of perlite or

350
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:07,419
personal light in there so we know he

351
00:13:05,169 --> 00:13:09,610
has got plenty of aeration we also know

352
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:11,469
that he listened to episode 337 so he

353
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:13,779
understands one through five water tech

354
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:15,879
he seems to understand that he wants a

355
00:13:13,779 --> 00:13:18,490
little bit of runoff but he is afraid to

356
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:20,259
water his small plants because he is not

357
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:22,629
sure that their small root system is

358
00:13:20,259 --> 00:13:24,669
ready to handle such a massive

359
00:13:22,629 --> 00:13:26,919
muttering that's a really good concern

360
00:13:24,669 --> 00:13:28,779
because watering Coco can be confusing

361
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:31,179
it can be deceiving the first few times

362
00:13:28,779 --> 00:13:33,579
Coco does hold a lot of water and the

363
00:13:31,179 --> 00:13:35,769
wet and dry time is vastly different

364
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:38,500
than that of working with a soil or

365
00:13:35,769 --> 00:13:41,199
soilless mix over watering your plants

366
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:43,120
in Coco will slow them down also under

367
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,800
watering them will allow them to get too

368
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,870
dry which prevents them from eating

369
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:49,779
which will give us nutrient deficiencies

370
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:52,210
so we do need to dial in our wet and dry

371
00:13:49,779 --> 00:13:54,819
cycles and our watering times and also

372
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:57,519
dial in our amount of runoff so let's

373
00:13:54,820 --> 00:14:00,129
talk about watering our small plants to

374
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:03,009
runoff the first part that really gets

375
00:14:00,129 --> 00:14:06,100
my attention is if you are too concerned

376
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:08,919
about giving that plant that much water

377
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:11,170
in that container size that maybe you

378
00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:13,809
have probably possibly up potted too

379
00:14:11,169 --> 00:14:15,789
early now you may have a small plant you

380
00:14:13,809 --> 00:14:18,159
may have a clone I would put that clone

381
00:14:15,789 --> 00:14:21,039
into a small pot I would go something in

382
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:22,779
like a 4x4 cube maybe a six-inch net pot

383
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:24,699
something really small where we can

384
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:26,470
contain all of that medium where we

385
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:27,879
don't have to water a whole bunch that

386
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:29,410
way you're not wasting a lot of water

387
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:30,970
you're not wasting a lot of nutrients

388
00:14:29,409 --> 00:14:32,709
just watering medium that doesn't have

389
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:35,500
any roots in it so start off with a

390
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:37,060
smaller pot then gradually increase pot

391
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:39,580
size until you reach your finished

392
00:14:37,059 --> 00:14:41,709
container size my clones generally go

393
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:44,139
into a four inch square pot or a 6-inch

394
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:47,080
round net pot then I let them grow until

395
00:14:44,139 --> 00:14:48,460
that pot is filled with roots I like to

396
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:50,680
get it almost rootbound in that

397
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:53,200
container then I will transplant it into

398
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:55,239
a three gallon pot when I go from that

399
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:57,400
four inch square pot or that round a six

400
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:59,200
inch net pot I usually have to use my

401
00:14:57,399 --> 00:15:00,819
fingers to break up some of those roots

402
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,770
to encourage them to grow outward

403
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:05,080
because I leave it in that first pot

404
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:07,120
until it gets fairly tight that first

405
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:08,889
container is only temporary I just have

406
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,810
it in there to get it develop just to

407
00:15:08,889 --> 00:15:12,370
get it started and I don't want to water

408
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:13,809
a whole bunch of medium and a whole

409
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:15,970
bunch of space with no roots so that

410
00:15:13,809 --> 00:15:18,459
smaller containers advantageous plus I

411
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:21,279
can fit more of them in my space so I

412
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:23,560
can pack way more small veg plants under

413
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:25,240
some t fives or veg lights in a small

414
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:27,009
pot than I could if I had them already

415
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:28,659
in their three gallon pots and they're

416
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:30,100
only six inches tall and have a few

417
00:15:28,659 --> 00:15:31,449
nodes and they haven't branched out yet

418
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:33,250
there's no need to give them that much

419
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:35,259
space so I keep them in the small pot

420
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:36,370
and I let them grow until they're almost

421
00:15:35,259 --> 00:15:38,289
rootbound

422
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:40,209
they really need to be transplanted by

423
00:15:38,289 --> 00:15:42,009
the time I pot them sometimes I almost

424
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:43,838
have to cut the pot off because the

425
00:15:42,009 --> 00:15:46,149
roots have grown so massively inside the

426
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:48,279
container so my first thought is that

427
00:15:46,149 --> 00:15:50,350
you may be transplanting too soon I

428
00:15:48,278 --> 00:15:52,419
would go from that clone to a small

429
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:54,490
container let it grow until it's busting

430
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:56,139
out then go to a big container and then

431
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:57,789
if you want to uh pot one more time I

432
00:15:56,139 --> 00:15:59,528
would wait once again until it is

433
00:15:57,789 --> 00:16:02,049
busting out until that first container

434
00:15:59,528 --> 00:16:03,549
is almost full of roots where when you

435
00:16:02,049 --> 00:16:05,469
take the container off you can see those

436
00:16:03,549 --> 00:16:07,508
roots just spiraling around the outside

437
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:09,180
of the container wait until then to

438
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:12,159
transplant and that will absolutely

439
00:16:09,179 --> 00:16:14,649
reduce the risk of drowning your plant

440
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:16,509
when you do water to full saturation to

441
00:16:14,649 --> 00:16:17,558
achieve a little bit of runoff so my

442
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:19,749
first concern is you may be

443
00:16:17,558 --> 00:16:21,458
transplanting too soon and if you're not

444
00:16:19,749 --> 00:16:23,409
transplanting too soon maybe you are

445
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:25,359
transplanting into too large of a pot

446
00:16:23,409 --> 00:16:27,818
maybe you need to make more gradual of a

447
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:30,370
pot size increase and that may reduce

448
00:16:27,818 --> 00:16:32,498
the risk of creating a giant pool for

449
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:34,389
that small plant to drown in so maybe

450
00:16:32,499 --> 00:16:37,240
wait a little bit longer and possibly

451
00:16:34,389 --> 00:16:39,339
reduce the transplant pot size that may

452
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:40,959
help you out right off the bat so let's

453
00:16:39,339 --> 00:16:43,959
say Brent has done everything correctly

454
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:45,818
he's got his small container plant it is

455
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:46,989
busting out the roots are starting to

456
00:16:45,818 --> 00:16:48,278
hang out of the bottom of the pot a

457
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:49,568
little bit you can see it creeping up

458
00:16:48,278 --> 00:16:50,740
through the drainage holes we got some

459
00:16:49,568 --> 00:16:52,688
roots coming out there they look like

460
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:54,490
nice spaghetti so that plant is in a

461
00:16:52,688 --> 00:16:56,708
four inch square pot or perhaps a six

462
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:59,318
inch net pot let's up pot that plant

463
00:16:56,708 --> 00:17:01,659
into a three gallon pot of cocoa so

464
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:03,159
let's say we just gently remove that six

465
00:17:01,659 --> 00:17:04,898
inch net pot right off the root ball

466
00:17:03,159 --> 00:17:06,818
there it should pop out if it's not

467
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:08,259
super wet if it's not super dry it

468
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:10,389
should just slide off nice and easily

469
00:17:08,259 --> 00:17:11,890
all of the mediums should stay in one

470
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:13,659
nice clump there you'll see roots

471
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:16,240
wrapped around the bottom of it at this

472
00:17:13,659 --> 00:17:18,278
point I would hold the plant in my palms

473
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,109
to where the plant is facing straight up

474
00:17:18,278 --> 00:17:21,849
just like it naturally should I'm kind

475
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:25,389
of cradling the plant in my palms I

476
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:27,759
would stick my fingers in the middle of

477
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:29,320
the bottom of that root ball and I would

478
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:30,730
just separate it and break it up a

479
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:32,379
little bit with my fingers you're gonna

480
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:34,269
hear it it sounds like you're pulling

481
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:37,179
someone's dreadlocks apart it sounds bad

482
00:17:34,269 --> 00:17:40,028
you were encouraging proper root growth

483
00:17:37,179 --> 00:17:41,500
at this time if that plant is tied up in

484
00:17:40,028 --> 00:17:43,329
that container you want to break those

485
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:45,099
roots up so that it will spread out

486
00:17:43,329 --> 00:17:46,720
those roots are now used to growing in a

487
00:17:45,099 --> 00:17:49,178
circle we want to tell them hey you're

488
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,420
free grow that way grow out grow down go

489
00:17:49,179 --> 00:17:52,340
fill this nuke

490
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:54,500
so I would separate them then I would

491
00:17:52,339 --> 00:17:56,629
set that in the new container that is

492
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:58,819
probably about halfway 3/4 of the way

493
00:17:56,630 --> 00:18:00,410
filled with cocoa set that new plant

494
00:17:58,819 --> 00:18:01,909
right inside that pot fill that

495
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:03,230
container up with cocoa packets

496
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:04,340
semi-tight in there you don't want it

497
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:05,720
super tight you don't want it super

498
00:18:04,339 --> 00:18:06,709
loose you don't let the water fall in

499
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,180
right through but you don't want it so

500
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:10,579
tight that the roots can't dig through

501
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:11,900
it so pack it semi tight when you're

502
00:18:10,579 --> 00:18:13,549
filling containers I always suggest

503
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:15,320
leaving an inch or two so that you can

504
00:18:13,549 --> 00:18:17,450
water the plant don't forget you need

505
00:18:15,319 --> 00:18:18,799
room for water in that container so

506
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:20,269
you've got it filled up appropriately

507
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:22,879
you've now got your plan essentially

508
00:18:20,269 --> 00:18:25,730
successfully transplanted at this time I

509
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:28,370
would saturate that cocoa I would water

510
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:31,610
until run off at that first transplant

511
00:18:28,369 --> 00:18:33,769
time I really love to soak the [ __ ] out

512
00:18:31,609 --> 00:18:35,329
of the cocoa I may go more than 20

513
00:18:33,769 --> 00:18:37,849
percent runoff at this time because I

514
00:18:35,329 --> 00:18:40,309
want to ensure that I saturate all of

515
00:18:37,849 --> 00:18:41,719
that medium with water with nutrients

516
00:18:40,309 --> 00:18:43,159
and I want to kind of settle everything

517
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,660
in I don't want there to be any dry

518
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:46,430
spots if there's a dry spot in the

519
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:48,259
middle that will slow down plant

520
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:50,150
production so I want to saturate my new

521
00:18:48,259 --> 00:18:51,740
medium and that'll really help the cocoa

522
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:53,390
settle into the container and let me

523
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:55,279
know if I need to add more onto the top

524
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:56,870
so now you're probably thinking holy

525
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:58,220
[ __ ] Rasta Jeff we just drowned the

526
00:18:56,869 --> 00:19:00,319
plants there's so much water in this

527
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:02,600
container it is super heavy yes it

528
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:04,519
should be but we've got an aeration

529
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:07,219
product in there we've got 20 percent

530
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:09,170
perlite we've got 20 percent perlite or

531
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:10,519
a similar mix in our container so we

532
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:13,009
don't have to worry about drowning the

533
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:14,629
plants we've also got a healthy plant

534
00:19:13,009 --> 00:19:16,430
with an established root zone they can

535
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:17,630
take this type of a watering so we

536
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:20,269
shouldn't have to worry about drowning

537
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:23,360
that plan now the next step is to watch

538
00:19:20,269 --> 00:19:24,379
this plant as the medium dries a lot of

539
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:26,929
people are gonna want to stick a

540
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:28,100
moisture content meter inside that cocoa

541
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:29,539
and they can pay attention to that

542
00:19:28,099 --> 00:19:31,129
digitally they can look at it on their

543
00:19:29,539 --> 00:19:33,200
phone and they can see what's going on I

544
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:35,300
think the best way to do it is to pay

545
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,009
attention watch the plant stick your

546
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:39,139
finger in the medium pick up the pot

547
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:41,059
when you pick up the pot does it feel

548
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:43,250
nearly as heavy as it did when you first

549
00:19:41,059 --> 00:19:44,659
water does it feel half as heavy as it

550
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:46,220
did when you first watered or does it

551
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:47,990
feel super light like you might throw it

552
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:50,539
across the room that comes from one

553
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:52,309
through five water tank feel that you'll

554
00:19:50,539 --> 00:19:54,349
know if it needs water when you put your

555
00:19:52,309 --> 00:19:56,509
finger in there does it feel wet does it

556
00:19:54,349 --> 00:19:59,089
feel dusty you'll learn does the plant

557
00:19:56,509 --> 00:20:01,730
need water the most important thing to

558
00:19:59,089 --> 00:20:03,319
pay attention to is the plant watch the

559
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:03,950
plant is it telling you that it needs a

560
00:20:03,319 --> 00:20:05,869
drink

561
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:07,580
when cannabis plants get thirsty the

562
00:20:05,869 --> 00:20:09,589
leaves start to droop when they get

563
00:20:07,579 --> 00:20:11,839
really thirsty the top of the plant

564
00:20:09,589 --> 00:20:13,759
starts to tip over pay attention to that

565
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:15,829
plant the minute you see those leaves

566
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:16,759
start to droop it needed water just a

567
00:20:15,829 --> 00:20:18,769
few minutes ago

568
00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:20,720
write down how long ago it was or

569
00:20:18,769 --> 00:20:22,579
remember what that medium feels like put

570
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,860
your finger in there now pick it up now

571
00:20:22,579 --> 00:20:25,429
remember that don't let it get to that

572
00:20:24,859 --> 00:20:27,799
point

573
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:29,779
next time water at 15 minutes before it

574
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:32,299
gets to that point and you have found

575
00:20:29,779 --> 00:20:35,029
the ideal watering cycle for a plant in

576
00:20:32,299 --> 00:20:37,099
a cocoa container your wet &amp; dry times

577
00:20:35,029 --> 00:20:40,910
are going to vary depending on plant

578
00:20:37,099 --> 00:20:43,639
size container size light size and VPD

579
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:45,950
of the room but as long as your plant is

580
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:48,140
large enough and established enough to

581
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:50,539
be in the size pot in which you have put

582
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:52,940
it you should not over water your plant

583
00:20:50,539 --> 00:20:56,180
if you give it enough time to dry

584
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:57,740
between waterings so my main suggestions

585
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:59,990
would be to make sure that your plant

586
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:02,240
has a well-established root zone before

587
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:03,740
you try to uh pot it my next suggestion

588
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,140
is make sure you're not going into too

589
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:08,240
large of a container then when you do

590
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:10,759
water get that saturation get that

591
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,349
runoff then the next step is patience

592
00:21:10,759 --> 00:21:14,930
and learning the plant to see when it

593
00:21:12,349 --> 00:21:17,149
wants water again that part is going to

594
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:19,970
be room environment

595
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:21,890
plant and strain and also watering type

596
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:23,420
dependent that is part of the

597
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:25,640
relationship that you will have to build

598
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:27,289
with each plant now sometimes you're

599
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:28,850
going to be worried because the bottom

600
00:21:27,289 --> 00:21:30,559
part of your container will have more

601
00:21:28,849 --> 00:21:32,689
moisture than the top part hopefully

602
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:34,399
your roots have grown down to that

603
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:36,740
bottom part and they are drinking from

604
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:39,440
that bottom part that slight dryness

605
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:41,660
will encourage the roots to go seeking

606
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:44,230
moisture and finding water and nutrients

607
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:46,610
but there is a fine line between

608
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:49,730
encouraging growth and completely

609
00:21:46,609 --> 00:21:51,500
starving and dehydrating a plant so pay

610
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:52,970
attention to the plants learn when they

611
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,589
start showing you that they're a little

612
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:56,900
bit thirsty and then learn to water

613
00:21:54,589 --> 00:21:58,970
right before that time you will develop

614
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:00,500
a relationship it will become very

615
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:01,880
comfortable you'll know you'll be able

616
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,859
to look and you'll go they're gonna want

617
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:06,410
water pretty soon so that will become

618
00:22:03,859 --> 00:22:08,029
natural to you and once your roots are

619
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:10,100
developed in that pot is full of roots

620
00:22:08,029 --> 00:22:12,200
you'll notice that they really they will

621
00:22:10,099 --> 00:22:14,209
tolerate being too wet more than they

622
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,980
will to dry so that would be something

623
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:17,940
that you'll start to notice again a lot

624
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:20,128
of this stuff just comes from developing

625
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:21,629
relationship with the plant a lot of it

626
00:22:20,128 --> 00:22:24,538
comes from developing a relationship

627
00:22:21,628 --> 00:22:26,788
with one specific cultivar so I would

628
00:22:24,538 --> 00:22:29,038
say dial it in grow one plant over and

629
00:22:26,788 --> 00:22:31,138
over again learn your cocoa learn your

630
00:22:29,038 --> 00:22:33,628
plant learn your watering system then

631
00:22:31,138 --> 00:22:35,008
expand from there whatever you do

632
00:22:33,628 --> 00:22:36,418
whatever I say whatever you learn

633
00:22:35,009 --> 00:22:38,610
wherever you read it just keep in mind

634
00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:40,679
the plants are the boss all the monitors

635
00:22:38,609 --> 00:22:41,939
all of the equipment all that stuff it

636
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:43,679
won't make a difference if you've got a

637
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:45,298
moisture content sensor in there and it

638
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:47,429
says there's plenty of water and that

639
00:22:45,298 --> 00:22:48,808
plant says [ __ ] the plant is right

640
00:22:47,429 --> 00:22:51,538
that monitor doesn't know what that

641
00:22:48,808 --> 00:22:53,460
plant likes so dial it in pay attention

642
00:22:51,538 --> 00:22:54,628
to the plants pick up your plants keep

643
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:56,639
an eye on them and you will learn

644
00:22:54,628 --> 00:22:58,259
exactly when to water your plants and

645
00:22:56,638 --> 00:23:00,178
again if you are worried about over

646
00:22:58,259 --> 00:23:02,190
watering you were probably in too large

647
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:04,769
of a container and the roots weren't

648
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:06,058
ready to go so big all right Brett I

649
00:23:04,769 --> 00:23:07,589
want to thank you for a great email

650
00:23:06,058 --> 00:23:09,388
thanks for listening up there in Canada

651
00:23:07,589 --> 00:23:11,308
big shout out to all of my friends up

652
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:13,859
north I do appreciate all of the

653
00:23:11,308 --> 00:23:15,210
Canadians support speaking of support if

654
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:17,308
