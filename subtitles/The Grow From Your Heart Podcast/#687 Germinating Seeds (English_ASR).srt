started as a seed maker a seed seller i

51
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:51,599

with a big jar of blue raspberry truffle

58
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:05,759
seeds these were grown this summer in a

59
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,759
greenhouse these will be a great example

60
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,759
to get us going here on the show

61
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:12,080
let's talk about the things we need for

62
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:13,598
a successful germination number one

63
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,800
ingredient for a successful seed

64
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:19,359
germination is quality seeds we want big

65
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,280
fat healthy seeds any seed that comes

66
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,640
from my brand let me show you something

67
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,479
i do i've never done this on a show i've

68
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:26,238
never shown anybody this these are the

69
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:27,519
actual seeds that you will get if you

70
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,680
purchase irish seeds i'm just going to

71
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,519
dump a couple into the lid this is how i

72
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,200
would package your seeds i would as i'm

73
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,439
packaging each one would get set on the

74
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:37,199
table and pressed under my finger you

75
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:38,639
can see i'm pressing it is not breaking

76
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:40,318
it is not i'm putting a lot of pressure

77
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:42,639
on it's not squishing or popping this is

78
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:44,560
a high quality seed i pressed so hard it

79
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:46,318
is stuck to my finger i pressed so hard

80
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,759
i've got a nice indention in my finger

81
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:50,079
this finger is calloused this is a

82
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:51,840
soldier finger for testing seeds these

83
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,599
are high quality seeds in my opinion

84
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,519
these will germinate these are very

85
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:56,639
viable seeds so what i'm going to do i'm

86
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,680
going to take a few of these seeds i

87
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:59,279
just dropped them right here into the

88
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,800
lid i'm going to make sure they're clean

89
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,479
i don't need any seed holes or any of

90
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,159
that stuff in here we don't need that to

91
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:05,759
contaminate our mess you won't get that

92
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:08,000
part you won't have seed holes and extra

93
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:10,560
junk this is just a jar of uncleaned

94
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,239
seeds kind of unrefined uh unsorted

95
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,000
seeds so these are just seeds i'm

96
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,719
pouring them out making a few selections

97
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,400
we've got enough gonna put these away

98
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:19,759
try to keep myself on track here but

99
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,959
we've got some seeds that's the main

100
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:23,280
ingredient here for successful

101
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,878
germination this is honestly how i

102
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,719
germinate seeds that i'm going to run in

103
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:29,039
my garden this is how i do test seeds

104
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:30,400
this is how i do dispensary grow seeds

105
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:32,798
any seeds i'm going to grow this is how

106
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,039
i do it i get this really technical

107
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,959
piece of equipment here this is a paper

108
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:38,639
towel this is from the dollar store

109
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,319
super affordable everybody should have

110
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:41,518
this maybe you should have a rag instead

111
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:43,839
of paper towels but today we're going to

112
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,280
use a paper towel um a lot of times i

113
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,719
won't even use the whole sheet luckily

114
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,840
we got the brand that gives you half

115
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:49,519
sheets we're going to take a half sheet

116
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,080
be more economical here i'm going to

117
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,239
fold it in half this is really critical

118
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,000
fold it in half and then half again i'm

119
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,280
just kidding this is not very critical

120
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,719
at all as being a smart ass i hope you

121
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,560
caught on to that i'm going to fold it

122
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:01,759
to this size

123
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,120
then i'm going to move these seeds out

124
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:05,280
of the way so i don't need them wet just

125
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,759
yet dump those on the table i'm going to

126
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,360
fold it to this size

127
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:10,479
then i'm going to get

128
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,560
this really

129
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:14,719
expensive fancy technical substance here

130
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,238
called bottled water so far everybody

131
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:17,519
should be able to follow along we should

132
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:19,599
all have these products readily

133
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,439
available then i'm just going to soak

134
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,199
this paper towel i'm just pouring

135
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:25,360
bottled water over the paper towel until

136
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,478
it is saturated it is soaked it's not

137
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,080
going to take much more water i'm going

138
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:30,000
to kind of let it sit right there then

139
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:31,839
i've got a little bowl over here nothing

140
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,199
fancy just a cereal bowl maybe a small

141
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:34,560
cereal bowl i'm going to pour this

142
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,759
excess water

143
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,680
into the bowl

144
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,439
now i've got a saturated paper towel

145
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,560
sitting on a plate so far we haven't

146
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:42,319
gotten really technical we haven't

147
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,959
gotten really crazy i hope everybody can

148
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:46,560
follow along then here's the fun part i

149
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:48,560
better close up this water with all this

150
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,079
electronic [ __ ] around here uh put the

151
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,040
stuff away here comes the fun part grab

152
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:55,359
the seeds put them on one side of your

153
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,360
paper towel that is wet pick one side

154
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,199
put them on there just drop them right

155
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,960
in there

156
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,478
and then

157
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:04,399
really easily real gently i'm going to

158
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:07,038
take the other side i'm just going to

159
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:09,038
fold it up so now i've just got a paper

160
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:10,240
towel folded like this it's really wet

161
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:11,279
you can see some water coming out that's

162
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,280
too much water i'm going to let that

163
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:15,279
water drip out but when it quits

164
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:16,719
dripping right about there

165
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:19,279
we're basically done we're going to take

166
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,199
this and i'm going to stick this

167
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:22,559
inside of a baggie

168
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,478
the reason i'm putting it in the baggie

169
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,560
is i want to retain this moisture i'm

170
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:28,079
going to go i've got places to go today

171
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,439
i can't get this baggy open there we go

172
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:31,439
i've got places to go today i've got

173
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:32,959
things to do i know that by placing this

174
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:34,879
inside of this baggie i've now trapped

175
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:37,038
this moisture in here we've just created

176
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:38,478
a little humidity zone the seeds are in

177
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:40,159
there getting really wet there's

178
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:43,519
humidity trapped in there i'm gonna set

179
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:45,520
this in a warm place i've got a grow

180
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:47,120
light that is on i've got a t5 light

181
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:49,198
right on top of that grow light will be

182
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,519
perfect it's warm it'll get this seed

183
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,520
going and it will start germinating that

184
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:55,359
wasn't super technical honestly that is

185
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:56,959
how i germinate all of my seeds and

186
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,800
we'll take this plate here we're just

187
00:05:56,959 --> 00:06:00,638
going to pour this excess water right

188
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,199
into this bowl that we've got

189
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,960
and then what i will do

190
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,000
usually this would go sit on the grow

191
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:07,758
light but right now we're just gonna

192
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,038
leave it right here on the table

193
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,800
so now while i'm recording this will

194
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:12,959
just chill right here it is totally fine

195
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:16,478
that is going to germinate it will take

196
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:18,478
probably somewhere around 24 to 48 hours

197
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:19,758
before you start seeing little tails

198
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:21,758
that is our goal here we want these

199
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:24,639
seeds to pop open i won't touch this or

200
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,319
open this for probably 24 to 48 hours

201
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,079
this will go somewhere like i said i'm

202
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,840
going to put it on top of a t5 grow

203
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:31,038
light i don't want to roast these i

204
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:32,959
don't want to cook them i don't want to

205
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:34,879
barbecue them i don't want to ruin them

206
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:36,000
with too much heat it is cold it's cold

207
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:37,439
here today you notice i got a long

208
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,560
sleeve shirt on it's been pretty cold in

209
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:42,240
colorado they would be okay here in this

210
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,079
ambient environment if they're okay

211
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,800
they're okay in the environment in which

212
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:48,399
you are in but i think in my veg area

213
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,000
right on top of that t5 light they'll

214
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:52,478
just be a little bit cozier it's just a

215
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,639
little bit warmer i don't generally put

216
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:56,800
them on a heating mat i'm only doing

217
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,400
that because it is winter time we are

218
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,079
shifting from the cold or from the warm

219
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:01,439
to the cold season and i don't want to

220
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:03,519
risk these seeds i don't want you to

221
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:05,598
risk your seeds so this is the type of

222
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:07,198
climate when i would use some heating

223
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:08,879
just that grow light is all i'm going to

224
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,960
use and that will be enough i've got

225
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:12,879
some notes i want to make sure i got

226
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:14,879
we're going to fold the paper towel wet

227
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:16,560
the paper towel put the seeds in there

228
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:18,800
fold it up put it in the baggie and

229
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,560
we're going to let it sit for 24 to 48

230
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,319
hours then we're going to check on it

231
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,079
through the magic of technology i

232
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,240
planned ahead i germinated some seeds

233
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:27,918
yesterday i haven't opened this this has

234
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,680
been sealed up for 24 hours we're going

235
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:31,279
to pop it open now together and we're

236
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,199
going to see what happened

237
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:34,000
these have been sitting on top of a t5

238
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,598
light

239
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,519
just chilling we're going to pop them

240
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:38,959
open together and we will see what we're

241
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:40,399
expecting

242
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:42,000
and i will take a picture with my phone

243
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:43,679
and insert this into the video just so

244
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,038
you get a better glimpse oh i am

245
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,360
impressed i don't know if this is coming

246
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:49,279
up on camera but we have got some

247
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,360
sprouts here i would be very gentle if i

248
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:53,198
were you uh these are this is a

249
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,720
germination test on a new line for me so

250
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,400
these aren't hypercritical for me they

251
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,039
don't have to go anywhere but this is

252
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:01,038
what you will see in 24 to 48 hours i

253
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:02,878
got little they look like spermies it's

254
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:04,399
a seed with the tail on it i'm trying to

255
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,000
put it somewhere i can't see what shows

256
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:07,038
up on the camera it's kind of far away

257
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,160
put it right here in front of the mic

258
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:10,079
maybe you can see the little tail that's

259
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,000
popping up but it's got little tails

260
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:14,478
coming out of it at this point these

261
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,478
seeds are ready to go into

262
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:18,800
cocoa dirt hydroponics however you're

263
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:20,240
gonna grow them now is the time so at

264
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,160
this point i'm gonna snap a quick photo

265
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,598
and try to keep talking at this point i

266
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,919
would get my container whatever i'm

267
00:08:23,598 --> 00:08:28,639
gonna put them in in my experience in my

268
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:32,478
situation i would take a beer cup a red

269
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:33,918
solo cup filled with um a

270
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,360
fluffy soil i'm not going to say any

271
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:37,918
brand names or anything like that but a

272
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,399
soilless mix or cocoa with a lot of

273
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:42,000
perlite in it so it's nice and fluffy i

274
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,320
would fill my container

275
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,679
i would pack it not tight but semi tight

276
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,278
i'd press it down so that it's in there

277
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:48,719
so that the seed has something to dig

278
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:50,639
through i want the seed to dig a little

279
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,360
bit but also don't want it to struggle

280
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:55,278
so i've got it semi-packed i would water

281
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,720
my medium at this point before i put the

282
00:08:55,278 --> 00:08:58,958
seed in there i would water that

283
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,959
container so i've got my soilless mix in

284
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:02,479
my cup make sure your container has

285
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:04,000
drainage holes if you're using cups you

286
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,360
have to put your own holes in it you

287
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,600
don't want to fill the cup up with water

288
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,759
and create a mud situation in there so

289
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,440
poke some holes in a cup uh fill it with

290
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:14,080
your medium of choice

291
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,920
then water it at this point ph adjusts

292
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,240
the water to somewhere between five

293
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:20,399
eight and six four you will be just fine

294
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,639
water it i don't add any nutrients i may

295
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:25,039
add some microbes at this time usually

296
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:26,639
don't add any nutrients most of the soil

297
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:28,480
that i buy has already got microbes in

298
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:30,799
it so i don't need to add a lot so i've

299
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,039
got my container with holes in it it's

300
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:35,519
got soil or soilless mix or cocoa with

301
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:37,599
perlite in there now i've watered it uh

302
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:40,240
at this point i would put my finger into

303
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,320
that mix about to the first knuckle one

304
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,680
knuckle deep is as deep as i would go

305
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,680
right in the center just make a knuckle

306
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:47,039
deep indention then i would put a seed

307
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:48,319
right in there let me snap a picture of

308
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:50,079
these seeds and then i will show you how

309
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,440
i would put them in there you'll see

310
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,879
this picture right here will end up in

311
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,040
the video

312
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:57,679
boom those are little tails we got

313
00:09:55,039 --> 00:10:00,079
at this point i would take a seed and i

314
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:01,278
would gently set it right into oh

315
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,480
they're kind of stuck to the paper towel

316
00:10:01,278 --> 00:10:03,278
be careful pulling them off the paper

317
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,360
towel

318
00:10:03,278 --> 00:10:07,360
don't break them there we go all right

319
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,120
this one's got a really long tail i hope

320
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,639
you can see how long the tail is on this

321
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,560
seed i'm getting in front of the black

322
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:14,879
microphone hopefully that helps you it's

323
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:16,799
got a really long tail on it this is the

324
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:20,078
direction in which it wants to be

325
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:22,159
planted the tail goes down the seed goes

326
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:24,000
up you want your roots to grow down into

327
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:25,838
the dirt you want your seed to grow up

328
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,078
and pop out of the dirt this is a

329
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,760
beautiful this is impressive this is a

330
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:31,359
very beautiful specimen of a seed i'm

331
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:33,278
really glad that we decided to germinate

332
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,720
these i'm trying to zoom in for you and

333
00:10:33,278 --> 00:10:36,559
do some camera cuts and i'm thinking

334
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,000
ahead but look at the health and beauty

335
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:39,679
of this seed this is a very beautiful

336
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,519
seed i'm very lucky that we germinated

337
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:43,599
these very glad that i got to show you

338
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,200
these these are vigorous seeds normally

339
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,639
it wouldn't stand up like that the root

340
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,160
shouldn't hold it up but this root is

341
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:50,159
acting like a stem already it's so

342
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:52,159
strong and super vigorous so you'd want

343
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:54,639
to plant it with the root going down and

344
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:57,120
the seed pointing up and don't plant it

345
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:59,039
so deep that it has to struggle like i

346
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,200
said knuckle deep my fingers are kind of

347
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:02,879
big i'm still going knuckle deep i maybe

348
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,278
maybe a short finger maybe only halfway

349
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:06,720
to a knuckle but just go knuckle deep

350
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:08,480
set that seed right in there it's where

351
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,399
it's pointing up and then just scoop the

352
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,240
dirt right back over it don't bury it

353
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,000
just kind of lightly backfill it and

354
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,000
then that seed the tap root will dig

355
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,039
down the top will start popping up and

356
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,200
now you have successfully germinated and

357
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:22,480
planted your seeds let me make sure

358
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,360
there are more notes that i want to keep

359
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,278
up on

360
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,800
um now you need to keep your seeds in a

361
00:11:25,278 --> 00:11:28,879
good your seedlings in a good

362
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:30,319
environment the t5 light that these have

363
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:31,919
been sitting on top of now they're going

364
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,440
to go right underneath there once they

365
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:36,479
get a little bit bigger i will move them

366
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,920
to the led lights my small veg space is

367
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,839
a t5 right now that's just the way that

368
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:42,159
things are going so they would go under

369
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:45,279
a t5 light i would keep them on a

370
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:48,078
minimum of 18 hours of daylight of

371
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:50,639
lights on schedule maybe more maybe 20

372
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:52,319
maybe 24 for a few days so at this point

373
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:54,959
i would just keep them under a strong

374
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,879
vegetative light cycle they don't need a

375
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:58,319
lot of light right now uh if you see

376
00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:00,000
them stretching they're not getting

377
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,200
enough light but if you're giving them

378
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,799
proper light they'll stay short and

379
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,480
squatty they don't need intense light

380
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:06,799
they just need the right light a t5 or

381
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,000
an led will be perfect so i put them

382
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:10,799
under a light

383
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,278
with somewhere uh more than 18 hours of

384
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:14,559
light sometimes my veg spaces get 20

385
00:12:13,278 --> 00:12:17,200
hours of light and four hours of

386
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:19,838
darkness sometimes i do 19.5 sometimes

387
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,440
18 6. somewhere in that area will be

388
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,959
good for your plants keep them in veg

389
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,519
they won't flower until you put them on

390
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:27,838
12 12. so let's get them under a solid

391
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,519
vegetative schedule if they're

392
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,720
stretching they want more light if

393
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,000
they're staying short they're getting

394
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,759
enough light if they look like they're

395
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,958
kind of roasting on you they're getting

396
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:36,958
too much light that's something you'll

397
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:38,638
have to learn to adjust it's going to be

398
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:40,319
plant specific light specific

399
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,839
environment specific that'll be a trick

400
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,000
to learn that's one of the details

401
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:47,040
you'll have to learn in your grow

402
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,519
environment i would keep them around 75

403
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:50,958
to 85 degrees that is optimal for the

404
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:53,360
seedlings maybe a little bit higher

405
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:54,719
maybe better the colder will slow them

406
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,039
down higher we'll get them growing a

407
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:59,200
little more quickly higher humidity is

408
00:12:57,039 --> 00:13:00,719
better i understand that sometimes it's

409
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,120
hard to get high humidity especially

410
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,360
right now we're in winter in colorado uh

411
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:08,480
it's dry here so the higher humidity the

412
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:12,480
better uh 75 85 degrees temperature is

413
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:13,680
good i do not use domes for my seedlings

414
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,839
i see a lot of people put their

415
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:18,479
seedlings in a dome or put some sort of

416
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:20,959
cover on it i do not do that

417
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,639
in my opinion that makes for weak

418
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:25,359
seedlings i want these seedlings to come

419
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:27,120
out and be ready domes are for clones

420
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,120
when you cut a clone the clone doesn't

421
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,560
have a root source a root zone a life

422
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,399
source to keep it going it's got the

423
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:33,919
clones have to survive from the humidity

424
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,440
in the environment if there's no

425
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:36,799
moisture in the air they don't have any

426
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,959
way to sustain themselves they don't

427
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:40,399
have roots to drink so they need a dome

428
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:42,879
we have to control that humidity in the

429
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:44,639
clones the seedlings don't need that

430
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:46,720
dome i think they want exposure to the

431
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,480
environment exposure to the wind that

432
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,160
makes them tougher then we don't have to

433
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,159
harden them off like we do clones i

434
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:53,919
think that the dome kind of turns your

435
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:55,360
seedlings into it makes them weak makes

436
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:57,120
them little [ __ ] doesn't give them

437
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,120
the vigor that they need from the very

438
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,839
beginning i want these seeds going

439
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:04,480
strong from day one so i do not use a

440
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:06,079
dome for my seedlings most of the time i

441
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,360
do not use a heating mat i do keep

442
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:09,838
saying i'm going to put these seedlings

443
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,159
on top of the t5 it is really cold at

444
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:14,079
this time of year in colorado i may use

445
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:16,000
that t5 light just to get them

446
00:14:14,078 --> 00:14:18,078
germinated past that there's not going

447
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,839
to be any heat mat nothing underneath

448
00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:22,000
them i've seen more people cook and

449
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:23,920
roast seeds i have honestly roasted and

450
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,839
boiled more seeds than i've germinated

451
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:27,679
when using a heat mat i keep checking my

452
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:31,040
notes to make sure i'm getting it going

453
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:32,399
um sometimes the seed shell will get

454
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:34,879
stuck to your seed let me show you a

455
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,799
good example this seedling will start to

456
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:38,559
grow it'll pop up out of the dirt and

457
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:40,719
then it'll go up toward the light this

458
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:42,719
little shell on here sometimes gets

459
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:45,199
stuck to the seed and people really

460
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,959
panic your seed may open up you may have

461
00:14:45,198 --> 00:14:48,958
a little plant forming and the little

462
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:51,198
helmet just might be stuck on there or

463
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:53,039
it might not even have opened it this is

464
00:14:51,198 --> 00:14:55,439
not a big deal this is not cause for

465
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:58,399
concern this is no reason to panic it is

466
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:00,959
very easy to fix if you are careful and

467
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:02,799
delicate and pay attention the easiest

468
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:04,319
way in my experience i call it taking

469
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:05,198
off the helmet the helmet got stuck

470
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,278
that's all you just got to get the

471
00:15:05,198 --> 00:15:09,759
helmet off and get that soldier back

472
00:15:07,278 --> 00:15:11,919
into battle so the helmet will get stuck

473
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:13,759
the easiest way in my opinion i get a

474
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:14,958
spray bottle that you could spray like

475
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:15,919
just a little squeeze sprayer you know

476
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:18,078
what i mean like you use it to clean the

477
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:20,240
windows uh get a spray bottle and just

478
00:15:18,078 --> 00:15:22,078
mist it with water just put some water

479
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,519
you don't have to ph you can if you want

480
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:25,679
i just get some water throw it in a

481
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,759
spray bottle spray the seedling spray

482
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:29,359
that down the helmet and you'll notice

483
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:31,519
it softens it up i don't know if i want

484
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,199
to risk doing it to this seed but once

485
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,799
you soften it up you can just grab it

486
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:36,159
and you can just probably pull it right

487
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:36,958
off this one doesn't want to come off

488
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:38,639
yet

489
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:40,319
but if it were opened up more it would

490
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,959
slide right off if you don't if you've

491
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,800
got big clumsy gorilla fingers like me

492
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:46,078
i'm a big dude i got big [ __ ] sausage

493
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:47,439
fingers you may want to use some

494
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:49,439
tweezers get in there gently with

495
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,600
tweezers and just pull the helmet right

496
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,440
off spray it with some water and just

497
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,000
let it come right off if you're pulling

498
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:58,720
and struggling let it wait a couple days

499
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,198
nature pushes that shell off it wants to

500
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,800
come off so in time with water with a

501
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:04,319
little help and a little um

502
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:06,479
encouragement you will be able to get

503
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,320
that off without causing problems don't

504
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,399
panic and don't freak out don't pull too

505
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,800
hard spray it with water the water will

506
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,320
act like a lubricant it'll uh make

507
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:16,719
everything separate it'll make it super

508
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,320
easy for you so if that seed shell gets

509
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,839
stuck just moisten it up use some

510
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,360
tweezers pull it right off if you don't

511
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,120
have tweezers if you have confidence if

512
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,800
you got a steady hand get in there just

513
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,399
pull it right off with your fingers

514
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:27,519
fortunately i've got a lot of seeds so i

515
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,198
could play with them and learn that sort

516
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:31,278
of stuff and figure out those kind of

517
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:32,639
experiments for you you do have to be

518
00:16:31,278 --> 00:16:34,799
delicate with these because they're

519
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:37,198
seedlings they're small little delicate

520
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:38,799
baby life forms but they're not precious

521
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:40,000
uh you're not going to destroy them you

522
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:41,758
can handle them you can see i'm picking

523
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,039
them up i'm playing with them this will

524
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,560
still grow this is going to be a very

525
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:47,120
viable seed i'm throwing it around and

526
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:48,638
playing with it the fingers on the acids

527
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,879
on my fingers are probably not good for

528
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:53,600
this i should probably be wearing gloves

529
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:55,120
but this is nature it's going to go into

530
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,639
the dirt there's going to be microbes in

531
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,159
the dirt there's going to be rolly

532
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,240
pulleys there's going to be spiders

533
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:01,679
there's going to be worms as this plant

534
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,759
grows if it were to grow in nature a

535
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:05,918
goat would piss on it the wind would

536
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:08,000
knock it over these are resilient plants

537
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:09,839
nature made this plant very resilient

538
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,599
and then the breeders have definitely

539
00:17:09,838 --> 00:17:13,838
found the keepers out of those resilient

540
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:15,279
plants and we've made it even better so

541
00:17:13,838 --> 00:17:16,639
don't be too afraid to handle your

542
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:18,639
plants don't be too afraid to handle

543
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,240
your seeds get in there learn your

544
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,839
plants learn your seeds touch them look

545
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,439
at them like have you ever just examined

546
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:25,279
a seedling like this it's pretty

547
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,959
interesting started off as a seed it

548
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:29,119
cracked open and others life coming out

549
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:31,279
of it and it's going to turn in in 12 or

550
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:32,558
13 weeks we're going to be smoking this

551
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:34,399
isn't that crazy

552
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:36,240
