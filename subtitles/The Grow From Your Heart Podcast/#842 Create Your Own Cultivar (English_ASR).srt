Jeff I've got a breeder and etiquette

101
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:19,560
question this is a great question and a

102
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:22,079
great way to kick off a podcast I do

103
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:24,560
appreciate this it says I want to grow

104
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,600
my own strain for myself and I want to

105
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,879
give it to my friends and family I would

106
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:31,320
like to say this is a strain that I made

107
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:32,759
I understand that that's kind of how I

108
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:35,319
got started there was a lot of pride in

109
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:37,160
making my first strain and um I made the

110
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:39,240
seeds I selected a male I selected a

111
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:40,759
female I put them together they made

112
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,240
seeds I had to wait a long time for

113
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:44,280
those seeds to be ready it felt like

114
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,240
forever then they were ready then the

115
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:47,719
best part was growing those and then

116
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,319
when my friends were smoking it they're

117
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,720
like bro what is this and I was like bro

118
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:54,000
I bred that I made that nobody else ever

119
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,759
will have that because that is my [ __ ] I

120
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,399
completely understand the pride the

121
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,960
enthusiasm and the excitement behind

122
00:04:57,399 --> 00:05:01,478
this idea and I fully support it and I

123
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:04,079
want you to do it so let me give you

124
00:05:01,478 --> 00:05:06,478
some guidance here it says do I just

125
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:09,359
take a male from raw genetics and a

126
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:13,360
female from iry genetics and voila I

127
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:15,000
made my own strain um kind of yes and I

128
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,960
actually I recommend those two breeders

129
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,759
those are uh raw and myself that our

130
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:20,519
stuff works well together I have bread R

131
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:22,000
strains together other people in the

132
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:24,680
group in the community have bread R

133
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,959
strains and it does work very well um

134
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,560
and I like the idea that you want to

135
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:29,318
start with two different breeders that

136
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,199
is a great way to get started you're

137
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:33,800
putting two totally different flavor

138
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,319
Petes two uh wide openen projects

139
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:38,520
together putting that together to make

140
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:40,879
your own stuff that is a great start but

141
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:43,399
uh voila did I make my own strain then

142
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:45,680
he follows up he says is it piggybacking

143
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:47,679
off of others how do I start without

144
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,519
ripping someone off for lack of better

145
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,120
term thanks for your time so I

146
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:52,839
understand what you're heading for and I

147
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,600
appreciate the forethought the sight the

148
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:56,439
courtesy the etiquette involved in this

149
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,199
question so if you just want to make

150
00:05:56,439 --> 00:06:00,879
these seeds for yourself if you don't

151
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:02,120
ever plan to uh sell these seeds if you

152
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:04,439
don't want to go to market if you don't

153
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:07,319
want to be a seed producer a retail

154
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:09,120
seller um you can just take plant a and

155
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:11,479
plant B throw them together make seeds

156
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,639
and enjoy that is fine that is how it

157
00:06:11,478 --> 00:06:16,199
all starts a lot of breeders um are kind

158
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,960
of picky they get a little pissy a

159
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:19,319
little whiny uh they act like little

160
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:22,239
[ __ ] to be honest with you when you

161
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:24,919
breed with their work I don't find that

162
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,038
to be reasonable uh they bred with other

163
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:29,399
people's work they did not invent I did

164
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:31,800
not we did not invent cannabis none of

165
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:33,478
us breeders on the market today and the

166
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,840
past or in the future invented this

167
00:06:33,478 --> 00:06:38,038
plant We Are all uh stewards of this

168
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:40,198
plant we are all here to represent this

169
00:06:38,038 --> 00:06:42,199
plant in the best way that we can uh

170
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:44,319
none of us invented it so uh you're

171
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:46,000
welcome to breed with my seeds raw

172
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,240
genetic seeds any other breeder out

173
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,478
there you are welcome and allowed to

174
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,720
breed with their seeds especially if you

175
00:06:49,478 --> 00:06:53,879
just want to make something for yourself

176
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,840
for the basement for your grow uh to

177
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:58,399
smoke with the homies to say I did this

178
00:06:55,839 --> 00:07:00,839
I'm proud now if you want to go a little

179
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:02,959
bit further if you ever plan on selling

180
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:05,679
these seeds there is a little more

181
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:08,159
etiquette involved in here um at that

182
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,720
point I would take a male and a female

183
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,000
and this is just um this is also this

184
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,120
used to be and I'm not sure if James

185
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,879
Bean still is if this is his requirement

186
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:17,840
but James Bean is the uh founder of

187
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:20,000
seeds here now and if a breeder

188
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:21,679
approaches him and he did what you said

189
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,839
just took raw and iy and threw him

190
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,439
together and made a seed uh James Bean

191
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:27,198
would probably tell you I don't want to

192
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:29,759
vend those seeds do a little bit more

193
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:32,038
work because here is what probably

194
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,319
possibly kind of should be done uh just

195
00:07:32,038 --> 00:07:35,839
with a little bit of etiquette this is

196
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:37,520
in my opinion a step that you should

197
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:39,478
possibly do just to give yourself some

198
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:41,878
credit some validity in this breeding

199
00:07:39,478 --> 00:07:45,158
project take your plant a and plant B

200
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:47,720
like you plan to do grow them out find a

201
00:07:45,158 --> 00:07:49,439
male or a female that you really love

202
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:52,199
but I recommend find a male to start

203
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:54,079
with and use that male to pollinate

204
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:56,520
other plants that you really enjoy so

205
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:58,519
create your own maale and then use that

206
00:07:56,519 --> 00:08:00,198
maale to do some work with and then

207
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:01,878
you've made you've done some work with

208
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:04,079
my gear and with Brad from raw you've

209
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:06,400
taken our stuff and made something which

210
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:08,279
is cool that's our work put together you

211
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:10,359
did that but then find a mail out of

212
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:11,878
that and put that to some other [ __ ]

213
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:14,199
maybe one of my other strains one of

214
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:15,800
Brad's other strains and then even do

215
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:18,199
one of somebody else's other strains I

216
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:20,520
don't know Mr Soul pick a a a Brother's

217
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:22,520
Grim strain and pick a Jinx Proof strain

218
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:24,079
and breed your creation to four or five

219
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:25,918
other breeder stuff just to Branch it

220
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:27,918
out a little bit and put some work

221
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:29,719
behind it don't just take the the blue

222
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:31,439
paint from Sherwin Williams and smear on

223
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:33,360
canvas and say I painted take that blue

224
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:35,038
paint mix it with some green paint and

225
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,800
then smear that [ __ ] on canvas then you

226
00:08:35,038 --> 00:08:38,519
kind of did something if you take that

227
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:39,879
blue and green and mix it together and

228
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:41,679
then you paint a stripe and put a red

229
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:43,639
stripe next to it now you're making some

230
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:46,000
art of your own that's the best way that

231
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:48,679
I think I can kind of explain that now

232
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,159
there are a lot of breeders out there um

233
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:51,879
that are going to throw a fit a lot of

234
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:53,480
breeders will get upset if you breed

235
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:55,639
with their gear and put their seeds to

236
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:57,200
Market some of those breeders I may

237
00:08:55,639 --> 00:09:00,199
reach out to them if you want to I'm not

238
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,480
going to even list who they are um

239
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:04,480
let's talk about the the Jack the Ripper

240
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:07,399
that I bred with I breed with a Jack the

241
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:09,800
Ripper male that Jack the Ripper is uh

242
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:12,000
subcools male that is not I did not make

243
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:14,359
that but I use that male in my breeding

244
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,278
project how do I feel ethical about that

245
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:18,919
how do I feel okay selling those seeds

246
00:09:16,278 --> 00:09:20,879
first of all uh rest in peace subcool

247
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:22,199
subcool passed away he's not using it

248
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:24,838
anymore he's not going to sell those

249
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:27,720
seeds um he's not losing anything off of

250
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:29,680
me uh recreating or keeping that plant

251
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,079
alive subol and I had a lot of great

252
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:32,639
conversations he taught me a lot of

253
00:09:31,078 --> 00:09:34,838
great things about the plant about the

254
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:36,799
industry uh about life he taught me a

255
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:38,519
lot of what to do also you guys know

256
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:40,838
very well subcool taught me a lot of

257
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:43,480
what not to do he was a good example for

258
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:45,360
this industry there was no map or no

259
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,879
road map of how to do these businesses

260
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,720
and subcool kind of showed me how to do

261
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:51,159
it in his own way he didn't teach me the

262
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,759
business I learned it by watching uh but

263
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:54,639
subcool was a big influence to me let me

264
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:56,639
get myself back on track but subcool was

265
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:58,879
my friend subcool was my mentor subcool

266
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:01,000
taught me a lot of things uh subcool

267
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:03,278
taught me what to do and what not to do

268
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,639
in this industry so when subcool passed

269
00:10:03,278 --> 00:10:07,559
I wanted to honor subcool and I felt

270
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:09,199
that Jack the Ripper should be continued

271
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:11,199
it's something that it's an amazing

272
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,560
strain it need to keep it need to be out

273
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,759
in the world still it didn't need to

274
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:16,439
disappear just because sub was gone and

275
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:18,799
it was a way for me to honor my friend

276
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:21,680
subcool take his Jack the Ripper plant

277
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:23,879
use the mail make another uh generation

278
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:25,799
of Jack the Rippers and put that to my

279
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:27,838
stuff so that subcool and I could uh

280
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:29,639
collab so I used that Jack the Ripper I

281
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,800
used that male to make further Jack the

282
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:33,759
Ripper generations and then I also used

283
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:36,319
that Jack the Ripper mail to outcross to

284
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:38,958
my stuff to do some collabs with subcool

285
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:41,240
after he passed to show love to subcool

286
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:43,479
now something I did out of respect out

287
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:45,560
of etiquette um that I just felt was

288
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:47,839
right uh to the industry to the business

289
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:50,518
to my relationship to the plant uh to my

290
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:53,440
relationship to subcool I reached out to

291
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:54,600
subcools um they were divorced when he

292
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,079
passed away so I'm not sure the

293
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,560
technical word there I'm going to say

294
00:10:56,078 --> 00:11:01,278
widow um I reached out to subcool's

295
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:04,039

308
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:30,519
I'm headed with this is there are a few

309
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:32,199
breeders out there that are are publicly

310
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:33,759
pissy about people breeding with their

311
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:36,200
work they talk about it on the internet

312
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:37,919
they talk about it online if you choose

313
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:41,240
to breed with some of their work maybe

314
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:43,360
reach out and say hey whoever breeder uh

315
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:45,839
I plan on breeding your plant to this

316
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,600
plant uh what is your protocol what is

317
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,079
your etiquette they could be a total

318
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,159
dick about it they could be cool about

319
00:11:49,078 --> 00:11:53,199
it if you're going to sell those seeds

320
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:55,559
they may have a problem with it but like

321
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,360
I said before they don't own cannabis

322
00:11:55,559 --> 00:11:58,879
bro they did not invent cannabis ask

323
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,680
them where they got the plants and seeds

324
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:03,278
that they started their breeding company

325
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:05,799

us I don't care how far back we go every

327
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:09,679
one of us breeders that is selling seeds

328
00:12:08,078 --> 00:12:11,359
is using somebody else's plants

329
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:13,479
somewhere in the line none of us

330
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,839
invented cannabis plants we didn't fart

331
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:17,360
a plant out of the sky we didn't

332
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:19,760
manifest one we didn't AI generate one

333
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,159
we didn't 3D print one we used a plant

334
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:23,919
that's somebody else bread somewhere

335
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:25,838
along the line so to say that you can't

336
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:28,759
work with somebody else's gear and sell

337
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:32,399
seats is uh hypocritical in my mind and

338
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:35,159
also uh I love the healing aspect the

339
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:37,759
community the uh the cannabis plant more

340
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:39,120
than I care about uh intellectual

341
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:40,639
property rights there are some things I

342
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,919
do care about don't steal my strain

343
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:45,159
names uh don't steal my artwork don't be

344
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:47,120
a dick like that but cannabis seeds get

345
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:48,838
them out there grow them uh get those

346
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,360
everywhere breed them make more get

347
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:52,480
everybody growing get everybody growing

348
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,919
the best ganja that they possibly can

349
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,680
that's the whole point of this podcast

350
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:57,958
overgrow the government grow the best we

351
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:59,319
can get everybody on top of the cannabis

352
00:12:57,958 --> 00:13:01,719
plants all right I'm [ __ ] super

353
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:03,760
rambly I wish I remembered what I smoked

354
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:04,959
before this podcast cuz I would tell you

355
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:07,439
and you could get some too and you could

356
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:09,359
feel as good as I do uh my dude Vista

357
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:12,360
this was a great question but like I

358
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:14,199
said um if you take plant a plant B

359
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:16,720
breed them together you've made your own

360
00:13:14,198 --> 00:13:19,799
project if you're satisfied with that

361
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:21,600
also uh make a a predictive goal before

362
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:23,559
you do this write down a goal and say I

363
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,519
want these plants I hope these plants do

364
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:26,799
this then you know if you hit your goal

365
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,919
if you hit your goal you got something

366
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:30,958
to brag about that is your first cross

367
00:13:28,919 --> 00:13:33,078
you you can claim it I would then find a

368
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:34,759
male out of that uh maybe even find a

369
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:36,599
female and F2 it but the first thing I

370
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:38,519
would do find a boy and then hit some

371
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,959
other girls and that is your breeding

372
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:43,159
project right there that you can talk

373
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:45,319
about that is your true work so um yes

374
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:46,799
the first run counts the second one is

375
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:48,800
when you can actually do something with

376
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:50,120
those seeds if you choose to my dude

377
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:52,000
thank you for the great question you got

378

383
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,240
question here in front of me this one

384
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:06,639
also came from that growel tab on

390
00:14:15,278 --> 00:14:19,120
question from my buddy Mike D goes a

391
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:21,759
little bit like this it says yo roster

392
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,320
Jeff I am in week seven of flower and I

393
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:26,000
would like to try to change my light

394
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:28,320
cycle back to the 186 schedule which you

395
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,919
promote it's a very good idea I endorse

396
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,680
that I recommend it I think you'll be

397
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:35,479
happy with it it says when I switch this

398
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:37,679
up what DLI should I shoot for

399
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:39,839
everything I read about says a shorter

400
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:41,919
light cycle in flower is better and I

401
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:45,079
don't want to damage my plants or waste

402
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:46,759
extra electricity if it's not necessary

403
00:14:45,078 --> 00:14:48,799
thanks for all you've taught me and I

404
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:50,879
appreciate you uh this is a great

405
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:53,319
question let me recap really quickly

406
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:56,278
what I'm talking about then I'll explain

407
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:57,920
my reply my response my answer here now

408
00:14:56,278 --> 00:14:59,278
let me recap a little bit about this

409
00:14:57,919 --> 00:15:01,360
question in case you're new to the the

410
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:04,120
podcast for a while now I've been

411
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:06,120
recommending a new light schedule toward

412
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,799
the end of the flowering cycle when most

413
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,159
people would begin to flush I don't know

414
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:11,679
if you flush or not that's a whole

415
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:13,480
another topic a whole another podcast

416
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:16,239
but when most people would begin to

417
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:18,440
flush that last 10 to 14-day period of

418
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:21,159
your flowering period I recommend

419
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:24,000
changing the light cycle we should be on

420
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:26,559
probably a 1212 cycle for flowering what

421
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:30,759
I recommend is changing that light cycle

422
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:32,159
to 18 hours on and 6 hours off now most

423
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:34,680
people when they hear this the first

424
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:36,799
time they think I am completely crazy

425
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:39,838
I've been called a lot of prime words

426
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:41,639
because of this idea but the only people

427
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:43,839
that think this is a bad idea are the

428
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:45,519
people who have not tried it the people

429
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:48,800
who have done this have all reported

430
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:50,720
great results with the 18 hours on and 6

431
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:54,240
hours off at the end of the flowering

432
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:56,440
cycle my theory here my theory is that

433
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,959
light is the number one source of energy

434
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:00,880
for our plants at the end of the

435
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:03,239
flowering cycle why wouldn't we give our

436
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:05,399
plants as much light as we possibly can

437
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,959
to beef them up when they get more light

438
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:08,759
they can photosynthesize more they're

439
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:10,679
going to get bigger they're going to get

440
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:12,720
beefier and they're going to finish a

441
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:15,559
little bit more quickly because there's

442
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:17,079
just more process happening so a lot of

443
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:19,559
people are going to say won't that cause

444
00:16:17,078 --> 00:16:21,799
your plants to rev no because we're

445
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:24,198
going to cut them down way before

446
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:26,719
they've even got that opportunity rev

447
00:16:24,198 --> 00:16:29,000
takes closer to 3 weeks to even start

448
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:31,480
we're going to cut these down 10 to 14

449
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,480
days in this process you have no fear no

450
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:36,600
concern of a reveg process so quick

451
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,680
recap at the end of flower the last 10

452
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:42,079
to 14 days I recommend putting your

453
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:43,958
light cycle back on to 18 hours on and 6

454
00:16:42,078 --> 00:16:45,479
hours off and then pay attention to

455
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:47,799
those tricomes because they're going to

456
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:49,440
ripen up more quickly than you were

457
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:51,078
familiar with and then you can Harvest a

458
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,920
little bit earlier and you will have

459
00:16:51,078 --> 00:16:56,078
beefier more dense buds possibly even

460
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:58,519
more weight at the end of harvest so

461
00:16:56,078 --> 00:17:01,359
this listener wants to try the 186 cycle

462
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:04,000
but they' got a question about the DLI

463
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,640
they said what DLI should I shoot for

464
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,439
because everything else I read was about

465
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:09,799
a shorter light cycle yes there are

466
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:11,558
other Educators out there other breeders

467
00:17:09,798 --> 00:17:13,279
other Growers that do talk about a

468
00:17:11,558 --> 00:17:15,318
shorter light cycle that will work you

469
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:17,678
will see results but I believe if you

470
00:17:15,318 --> 00:17:19,399
try what I am preaching one time compare

471
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:22,480
that to those other light cycles I think

472
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:25,640
you will be happy with this 186 now the

473
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:27,919
question is what DLI should I shoot for

474
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:30,840
honestly here's a really simple answer I

475
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:33,679
don't have a DLI number for you in any

476
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:35,879
way shape or form uh whatever the DLI is

477
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:38,960
in your room now with those lights on at

478
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:41,039
1212 just simply change the timer that's

479
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,200
all you got to do a lot of people ask me

480
00:17:41,038 --> 00:17:44,960
questions about this adjustment they

481
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,120
want to know do I increase the lights do

482
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,558
I turn down the lights uh do I change

483
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:51,159
the Spectrum do I move the lights no the

484
00:17:49,558 --> 00:17:53,639
only thing I can recommend the only

485
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:55,400
thing I do I change the timer I don't

486
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:58,120
move the lights I don't change the

487
00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:01,120
Spectrum I don't even check the DLI if

488
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:02,798
I'm on 12 12 I had 6 hours that's all I

489
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:04,359
do and that's what I would recommend for

490
00:18:02,798 --> 00:18:06,359
you as well I understand that we all

491
00:18:04,359 --> 00:18:08,000
like a metric uh I understand that we

492
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:10,000
like some sort of reading some sort of

493
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,119
data some sort of info we could write

494
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,359
down but in this scenario I've never

495
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:17,158
bothered to do that because that wasn't

496
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:19,240
uh part of my experiment part of my idea

497
00:18:17,159 --> 00:18:21,360
it didn't matter to me because I knew

498
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:23,000
that whatever I was getting I want 6

499
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:25,119
hours more that was just the thought

500
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,640
process in there I understand that you

501
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:29,079
want data metrics analytical points that

502
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,880
we can write down but that's not I was

503
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:33,519
headed with this I've been growing

504
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:35,480
cannabis uh really good cannabis way

505
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:38,079
before we had all this technology way

506
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:40,798
before I had access to uh before I even

507
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:43,319
knew what DLI and VPD and all that [ __ ]

508
00:18:40,798 --> 00:18:45,240
was uh I was doing it intuitively I was

509
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:49,439
watching the plants and seeing how the

510
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:50,919
plants respond to uh light stress abuse

511
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,120
whatever and that's how I know how to

512
00:18:50,919 --> 00:18:54,840
manipulate the plant is by seeing what

513
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:56,519
has happened my pH pin is one of my

514
00:18:54,839 --> 00:18:58,798
favorite tools but beyond that I don't

515
00:18:56,519 --> 00:19:00,400
need a lot of oh and probably my uh my

516
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:02,400
hygrometer I need to know how hot and

517
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,360
cold it is in the room and what the the

518
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,200
uh the humidity is in there uh so I've

519
00:19:04,359 --> 00:19:07,519
got a VPD monitor now that tells me all

520
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:09,960
of that but back in the day I didn't

521
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:12,519
need any of that stuff I look at the

522
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:13,880
plants the plants tell me almost

523
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:16,038
everything I need to know about that

524
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:18,000
grow room I look at the timer make sure

525
00:19:16,038 --> 00:19:20,400
the timer is set right make sure the VPD

526
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,960
is in line and then look at the plants

527
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,400
if the plants are doing one thing it

528
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:25,200
means this if the plants are doing the

529
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:27,080
other thing it means this have you ever

530
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,000
just reached out and touched your plants

531
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:30,240
to see if they're hot or cold remember

532
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,480
when you're little your mom would touch

533
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,319
your cheek and say you're cold you need

534
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:34,720
a jacket you do the same thing to your

535
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:36,079
plants if you think they're getting cold

536
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,279
Reach Out And Touch them if they feel

537
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:39,798
cold they're probably cold crank up the

538
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:42,678
heat in the room add more light do

539
00:19:39,798 --> 00:19:45,000
something like that my point is um I

540
00:19:42,679 --> 00:19:47,200
don't have a perfect DLI number for you

541
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,558
because I never uh that wasn't part of

542
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,840
my experiment part of my project here I

543
00:19:49,558 --> 00:19:53,918
noticed when I gave them more light they

544
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:55,480
performed better and finished earlier

545
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:58,840
and the way I gave them more is whatever

546
00:19:55,480 --> 00:20:00,558
I was giving them 6 hours more so I know

547
00:19:58,839 --> 00:20:03,839
wish that I had a data point I wish I

548
00:20:00,558 --> 00:20:06,158
did too but plus 6 hours is my algebra

549
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:07,678
for you here uh my dude Mike D you got

550
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:09,679
me rambling pretty good whatever I've

551
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:11,440
been smoking has me rambling pretty good

552
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:13,320

front of me this one came from my friend

redirect.sh yo Rasta Jeff if a plant you

570
00:20:56,759 --> 00:21:01,000
are making seeds with getss powdery

571
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:03,600
mildew are those seeds guaranteed to

572
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,319
have powdery mildew inside of them I

573
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:06,959
can't wait till the next drop thanks for

574
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:10,038
your breeding this is a very good

575
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:12,120
question I like this there are two

576
00:21:10,038 --> 00:21:15,240
different uh thought processes that my

577
00:21:12,119 --> 00:21:18,000
brain head down when we talk about this

578
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:19,919
question so let me try to unwrap both of

579
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
them slowly and we'll figure this out

580
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:24,080
together um so what this person is

581
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,759
asking if you've got a plant and you

582
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:27,798
pollinated it and there are seeds inside

583
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:29,960
of that plant if this plant gets

584
00:21:27,798 --> 00:21:32,038
attacked by powder mildew will those

585
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:34,480
seeds have powdery mildew inside of them

586
00:21:32,038 --> 00:21:36,879
the answer to that is quickly no uh

587
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,480
powdery mildew does not work like that

588
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,320
uh the babies will not be born with

589
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,558
powdery mildew that does not work that

590
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:45,079
way there could however be powdery

591
00:21:42,558 --> 00:21:47,440
mildew on the outside of the seed which

592
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:49,439
is a completely different story it is

593
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,880
not in the seed it is on the outside

594
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:54,038
which means it can be removed and

595
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:56,240
sanitized it's two totally different

596
00:21:54,038 --> 00:21:57,919
things so it may be on the outside the

597
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,599
powdery mildew may be on the outside of

598
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:02,679
that seed but it is not within that seed

599
00:22:00,599 --> 00:22:04,759
so if you clean the outside it can be

600
00:22:02,679 --> 00:22:07,798
sanitized it can be removed that is very

601
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:10,759
easy to do now what we're talking about

602
00:22:07,798 --> 00:22:12,679
here um is kind of a question about

603
00:22:10,759 --> 00:22:14,440
epigenetics this may be the first time I

604
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:17,240
brought up epigenetics here on this

605
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:19,320
podcast um let me explain it very simply

606
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:21,919
I don't understand epigenetics on a

607
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:24,119
scientific level um I understand it on a

608
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:25,840
very rudimentary level the way that I

609
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:28,639
can explain it in a way that I think we

610
00:22:25,839 --> 00:22:32,678
will all understand is if a living

611
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:33,799
organism faces um a problem adversary

612
00:22:32,679 --> 00:22:35,640
the same sort of we're going to we'll

613
00:22:33,798 --> 00:22:37,918
use we'll jump right to the point if a

614
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:40,038
cannabis plant um over several

615
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:43,559
Generations if a cannabis plant is

616
00:22:40,038 --> 00:22:46,319
attacked with powdery mildew eventually

617
00:22:43,558 --> 00:22:48,918
epigenetics will create an evolutionary

618
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:50,439
cure for that problem and now this is

619
00:22:48,919 --> 00:22:52,880
where I've got two different schools of

620
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:54,519
thought because part of me would say

621
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,720
well find plants that aren't susceptible

622
00:22:54,519 --> 00:22:59,319
to powdery mildew and breed with those

623
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:01,480
but also this is how you generate plants

624
00:22:59,319 --> 00:23:03,278
that are not susceptible to powdery Milo

625
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:05,839
so breed with those two different

626
00:23:03,278 --> 00:23:07,480
schools of thought here follow along

627
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:09,079
this may be an environmental issue and

628
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:11,200
any plant we put in this region is going

629
00:23:09,079 --> 00:23:13,000
to get powdery mildew so if we had the

630
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,480
if you had a grow room that every time

631
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,240
you put plants in there they get powdery

632
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:19,440
Milo something I may think of doing this

633
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:21,839
is just a wild idea but let's breed in

634
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:24,038
that room and let's breed in that room

635
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:26,038
for 10 generations and maybe the 10th

636
00:23:24,038 --> 00:23:27,879
Generation that plant will realize

637
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:30,158
powdery Milo is not going away I've got

638
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:32,400
to do something about it eventually

639
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:35,278
those seeds will start to build a

640
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,960
defense and an immunity um a resistance

641
00:23:35,278 --> 00:23:39,000
to powdery Milo and that is how you can

642
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:41,038
breed that in there is by doing it

643
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,519
multiple times putting a plant so we

644
00:23:41,038 --> 00:23:45,599
take a plant put it in the room it' get

645
00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:48,038
powdery mildew you take seeds out uh

646
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:50,038
grow those plants put plants in that

647
00:23:48,038 --> 00:23:52,079
room again the one that got the least

648
00:23:50,038 --> 00:23:54,558
amount of powdery Milo in that same

649
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:56,720
condition select that one breed to that

650
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:59,399
plant pollinate that plant pull the

651
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:01,278
progyny from those the plant out of that

652
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:03,679
generation that gets the least amount of

653
00:24:01,278 --> 00:24:05,278
powdery mildew breed to that again but

654
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:06,960
keep that room [ __ ] up so we get

655
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:08,640
powdery mildew in there every time and

656
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,798
keep pulling out the one with the least

657
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:13,640
amount of powdery Milo generation after

658
00:24:10,798 --> 00:24:15,639
generation and I think that epigenetics

659
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:17,880
evolutionary time over time over

660
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:19,360
Generations will teach this plant

661
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:21,000
powdery Milo is going to [ __ ] happen

662
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:23,119
you got to be ready for it and

663
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,000
eventually we will breed plants that

664
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:26,839
don't get powdery mildew that is one

665
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,839
school of thought my other school of

666
00:24:26,839 --> 00:24:29,959
thought is why don't we breed plants why

667
00:24:28,839 --> 00:24:32,439
are you putting [ __ ] in the room that

668
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:35,120
gets powdery mildew but that is how you

669
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:36,640
do it so I would also say if a plant

670
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:38,759
gets powdery mildew in your room don't

671
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,480
breed to it but we've got this uh this

672
00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:42,720
chamber of death here that we've set up

673
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,839
so that is one way to kind of breed out

674
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:48,319
powdery mildew or breed in powdery Milo

675
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:49,839
resistance to plants over Generations uh

676
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:51,439
keep getting them powdery Milo and

677
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:53,639
select the best one put it in there

678
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:55,640
select the best one put it in there but

679
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:58,440
also while you're doing this my my side

680
00:24:55,640 --> 00:25:01,000
B thought over here says take that same

681
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:02,759
plant and put it in a normal environment

682
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,480
and see if it gets powdery milw in there

683
00:25:02,759 --> 00:25:06,200
see if it's just if it's going to get it

684
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,720
in normal environments or if it only

685
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:10,600
gets it from this heavy room test it in

686
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,000
normal conditions and stressful

687
00:25:10,599 --> 00:25:14,038
conditions would be my thought process

688
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,159
to that that's my breeder brain wanting

689
00:25:14,038 --> 00:25:18,919
to be um what is it called redundant on

690
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:22,278
seeing how healthy these plants are how

691
00:25:18,919 --> 00:25:24,038
resistant they are so um no the answer

692
00:25:22,278 --> 00:25:25,880
is no there will not be powdery mildew

693
00:25:24,038 --> 00:25:28,000
inside of your seed but there could be

694
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:31,320
on the outside of the seed which is why

695
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,319
many people use um a light dilution a

696
00:25:31,319 --> 00:25:35,480
light solution of diluted hydrogen

697
00:25:33,319 --> 00:25:38,398
peroxide when they're germinating seeds

698
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:40,240
I don't do that I don't recommend that

699
00:25:38,398 --> 00:25:42,798
um I feel that that wipes off all of the

700
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:44,359
living uh microbes we want right off of

701
00:25:42,798 --> 00:25:46,398
that plant I do something a little bit

702
00:25:44,359 --> 00:25:48,759
different I choose to put microbes I

703
00:25:46,398 --> 00:25:50,918
introduce my own microbes into that soil

704
00:25:48,759 --> 00:25:52,359
into that Seed Life uh before it's got a

705
00:25:50,919 --> 00:25:54,520
chance to get attacked of course I do

706
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:56,119
use recharge is what I use add a little

707
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:57,879
bit of recharge to that germination

708
00:25:56,119 --> 00:26:00,319
water or that soil and with that

709
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:02,679
recharge will do it's already colonizing

710
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:05,119
beneficial bacteria so there's no room

711
00:26:02,679 --> 00:26:06,880
for the negative bacteria to get in no

712
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:08,959
problems get in there can get in there

713
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:11,039
my security guards if you will uh big

714
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:13,600
shout out to Scotty reel I Scotty reel a

715
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:15,158
shout out for the recharge um uh yeah

716
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:17,359
use some recharge to prevent that sort

717
00:26:15,159 --> 00:26:19,159
of that powdery mildew problem but they

718
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:20,798
will not be on the inside of the seed

719
00:26:19,159 --> 00:26:23,600
the zygote will not contain powdery

720
00:26:20,798 --> 00:26:25,440
mildew but quite the opposite if you

721
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:27,599
breed several Generations like I was

722
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:30,759
talking about you can breed powdery Milo

723
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:32,439
resistance into that plant so my dude

724
00:26:30,759 --> 00:26:34,798
Vermont rede thank you for the great

725
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:36,200
question very unique idea very unique

726
00:26:34,798 --> 00:26:38,359
question we haven't heard something like

727
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:40,919
this and I got to sound smart by talking

728
00:26:38,359 --> 00:26:42,879
a little bit about epigenetics all right

729
