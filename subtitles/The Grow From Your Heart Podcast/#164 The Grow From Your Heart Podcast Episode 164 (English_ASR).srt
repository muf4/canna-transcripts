00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:34,008
what you're growing out there I also

167
00:05:32,689 --> 00:05:35,330
want to know what part of SoCal you're

168
00:05:34,009 --> 00:05:37,759
in because that's where I'm from I

169
00:05:35,329 --> 00:05:39,258
actually grew up in Bellflower

170
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,729
California I went to Bellflower high

171
00:05:39,259 --> 00:05:42,588
school for middle school and then I

172
00:05:40,728 --> 00:05:45,318
moved to Colorado in the middle of ninth

173
00:05:42,588 --> 00:05:46,579
grade so I'm from SoCal also a lot of

174
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:47,870
people call me out like what part of

175
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:49,430
California you from Italy what are you

176
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:50,959
even talking about they say that the

177
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:52,759
clothes I wear and the way that I am

178
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:54,829
they can tell I'm from California then

179
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:56,960
call that a few times so then you also

180
00:05:54,829 --> 00:05:59,838
say you want to listen to the first 50

181
00:05:56,959 --> 00:06:01,728
episodes most of the feeds apparently

182
00:05:59,838 --> 00:06:03,740
don't have the first 50 episodes cuz I'm

183
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:06,500
all the way up to 160 this is gonna be

184
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:07,728
164 so it looks like the last 64

185
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,829
episodes are getting bumped out of the

186
00:06:07,728 --> 00:06:11,688
feed what I've been talking about doing

187
00:06:09,829 --> 00:06:13,490
is going and finding those old episodes

188
00:06:11,689 --> 00:06:15,169
they're in my computer they're on my my

189
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:16,668
drive over there I just need to plug

190
00:06:15,168 --> 00:06:18,620
that in and find the old episodes and

191
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:21,918
probably on my web server still and just

192
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:23,509
repost them and then I don't know if I

193
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:24,680
want to like go back and edit them at

194
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:26,330
all and be like hey what's up this is a

195
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,709
repost or if I just want to repost it

196
00:06:26,329 --> 00:06:29,778
and put it in the feed as a bonus

197
00:06:27,709 --> 00:06:32,269
episode but that's probably the best way

198
00:06:29,778 --> 00:06:33,649
to do it if you really want them super

199
00:06:32,269 --> 00:06:35,269
bad send me an email if you guys are

200
00:06:33,649 --> 00:06:36,588
like dying to hear the first 264

201
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:38,658
episodes or something send me an email

202
00:06:36,588 --> 00:06:40,848
maybe we can work out a way where I can

203
00:06:38,658 --> 00:06:42,019
send you the files through we transfer

204
00:06:40,848 --> 00:06:43,699
Dropbox or something

205
00:06:42,019 --> 00:06:45,168
we'll get it going but I may just throw

206
00:06:43,699 --> 00:06:47,449
in the first episode the first 50

207
00:06:45,168 --> 00:06:48,829
episodes back in the feed like every 5

208
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:49,879
or 6 episodes or something just put

209
00:06:48,829 --> 00:06:51,318
another one in there so that you guys

210
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:53,449
can go listen to the old stuff and

211
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:54,770
that'll also be a fun exercise and

212
00:06:53,449 --> 00:06:55,788
seeing how much we've progressed cuz

213
00:06:54,769 --> 00:06:58,219
you'll be able to spot the old episodes

214
00:06:55,788 --> 00:07:00,800
right away so I may have to put the old

215
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:02,270
episodes back in the feed and maybe if

216
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,620
you send me an email and you ask really

217
00:07:02,269 --> 00:07:04,818
nicely for a few episodes they can't

218
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:06,379
send you all 50 at once that's gonna

219
00:07:04,819 --> 00:07:08,300
blow up my computer but if you ask me

220
00:07:06,379 --> 00:07:10,039
for a few episodes at a time maybe I can

221
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:11,360
send you a few at a time maybe put me

222
00:07:10,038 --> 00:07:13,399
maybe we can make a list or something

223
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,680
few people and then I can just dump all

224
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:17,299
the episodes to a few people like 5 at a

225
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,530
time or something 5 a week something

226
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:20,509
like that I'd love to help you out

227
00:07:18,529 --> 00:07:21,948
though we'll get it going for you email

228
00:07:20,509 --> 00:07:23,300
me back if you want them as a file

229
00:07:21,949 --> 00:07:24,740
anyway that is listening if you want the

230
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,879
first 50 we can figure something out

231
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:27,439
send me an email let me see how many

232
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:29,180
people are interested we'll figure

233
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:30,740

00:07:48,348 --> 00:07:53,180
hello Jeff thanks for the podcast I

245
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:55,009
enjoy hearing your curing episodes your

246
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:57,829
drying and curing method is almost

247
00:07:55,009 --> 00:07:58,908
exactly the way I do it so word nice

248
00:07:57,829 --> 00:08:00,859
it's good to know that people out there

249
00:07:58,908 --> 00:08:02,509
are doing the things that I'm doing it's

250
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:03,919
good to know that other people have the

251
00:08:02,509 --> 00:08:05,389
same ideas that I do and working with

252
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:07,939
the same methods a little affirmations

253
00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:10,370
always a good a good thing you also say

254
00:08:07,939 --> 00:08:11,990
I would add that I trim dry my plants on

255
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:14,180
a piece of parchment paper so I can

256
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:16,550
collect the resin resin heads off that

257
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:18,709
fall later when I clean up that's a

258
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:20,569
really good good idea you guys when

259
00:08:18,709 --> 00:08:22,459
you're about to trim your buds put down

260
00:08:20,569 --> 00:08:24,110
what did he say that he added some

261
00:08:22,459 --> 00:08:26,028
parchment paper put down a sheet of

262
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:27,590
parchment paper over the table and then

263
00:08:26,028 --> 00:08:29,028
trim onto the parchment paper and then

264
00:08:27,589 --> 00:08:30,408
when you're done you can clean up all

265
00:08:29,028 --> 00:08:31,699
the kief that came off of there you're

266
00:08:30,408 --> 00:08:33,200
gonna have a bunch of resin heads on

267
00:08:31,699 --> 00:08:35,209
there and then you can either put those

268
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,550
in a bowl and smoke them or if you're

269
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:39,588
really into it you can press them if you

270
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:40,759
know how to make rosin so that's

271
00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:42,169
something that's useful that's a good

272
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:45,289
idea thanks for the heads up on that one

273
00:08:42,168 --> 00:08:48,230
fast Barry he also continues he says I

274
00:08:45,289 --> 00:08:50,419
have a full-time job so no time for

275
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:52,970
excessive burping of jars but I do put

276
00:08:50,419 --> 00:08:54,769
the lids on upside down metal to glass

277
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:56,839
and loosely screw on the

278
00:08:54,769 --> 00:08:58,339
cap see you guys instead of sealing the

279
00:08:56,839 --> 00:09:00,050
cap the normal way where it's got the

280
00:08:58,339 --> 00:09:01,939
waxy seal against the glass and then you

281
00:09:00,049 --> 00:09:04,099
put the lid on real tight he flips it

282
00:09:01,938 --> 00:09:06,799
upside down and puts the metal to glass

283
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:08,569
on there so it's not making a super

284
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:11,149
tight seal and then he only screws it on

285
00:09:08,568 --> 00:09:13,099
medium tight apparently loosely screws

286
00:09:11,149 --> 00:09:14,568
on the cap he says it allows some air

287
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:18,528
exchange but it prevents buds from

288
00:09:14,568 --> 00:09:20,719
drying out I do that for 48 hours then I

289
00:09:18,528 --> 00:09:23,808
start the 12-hour check burp and will

290
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,249
repeat as needed then daily then weekly

291
00:09:23,808 --> 00:09:27,499
blah blah blah and he said you know you

292
00:09:25,249 --> 00:09:30,499
just did the episode Thanks fast beary

00:09:39,889 --> 00:09:42,409
other people are doing that and you guys

300
00:09:41,089 --> 00:09:44,989
that's a great update and a great

301
00:09:42,409 --> 00:09:46,818
addition to what I said if you have a

302
00:09:44,989 --> 00:09:48,619
full-time job if you are if you can't

303
00:09:46,818 --> 00:09:50,088
dedicate 24 hours a day to your grow

304
00:09:48,619 --> 00:09:52,220
which is understandable I'm not calling

305
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:53,629
you out most people have a normal job

306
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:55,699
and they grow in their spare time if

307
00:09:53,629 --> 00:09:58,909
this is you and you can't check those

308
00:09:55,698 --> 00:10:00,469
jars if you've got to go to work I for a

309
00:09:58,909 --> 00:10:03,708
long time for like a year

310
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:06,048
I lived 55 miles away from where I work

311
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:07,758
so take me one hour to get to work then

312
00:10:06,048 --> 00:10:10,009
I would be at work for 8 to 12 hours

313
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:11,959
maybe 14 hours on some days then there's

314
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:13,129
another drive home and then you got to

315
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:14,359
do whatever you do when you get home you

316
00:10:13,129 --> 00:10:16,039
got to eat you got a poopy at a shower

317
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:18,079
you got to put on clothes for the next

318
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:20,868
day you got to get all that [ __ ] going

319
00:10:18,078 --> 00:10:23,508
so of course it limited me to maybe 4 or

320
00:10:20,869 --> 00:10:25,040
5 hours of time that I was able to work

321
00:10:23,509 --> 00:10:26,600
on my garden at home so I totally

322
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:28,578
understand that a lot of people are in

323
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,678
that situation you guys can put your

324
00:10:28,578 --> 00:10:32,599
buds in these jars and you can leave the

325
00:10:30,678 --> 00:10:33,798
lids on upside down and loose and you'll

326
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,749
get some airflow in there and you'll

327
00:10:33,798 --> 00:10:37,610
still slowly dry the buds because that's

328
00:10:35,749 --> 00:10:40,519
your main objective is to slowly and

329
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:42,949
evenly dry these buds all right

330
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:44,480
fast Barry I appreciate the email you

331
00:10:42,948 --> 00:10:46,548
guys keep the emails coming that is

332
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,278
super helpful I've got one more email

333
00:10:46,548 --> 00:10:51,139
that is actually a correction I said

334
00:10:49,278 --> 00:10:54,230
something in an episode about THCA

335
00:10:51,139 --> 00:10:56,418
converting to THC but guess what I was

336
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:58,819
wrong I said that [ __ ] backwards so let

337
00:10:56,418 --> 00:11:00,139
me read an email he says his name in the

338
00:10:58,818 --> 00:11:02,360
email I'm gonna skip it he says hey

339
00:11:00,139 --> 00:11:03,798
brother my name is beep and I've been

340
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,509
listening to your podcast since I heard

00:11:03,798 --> 00:11:07,639

352
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:23,050

353
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:25,100

356
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,410
of the podcast your grow techniques your

357
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:32,719
advice and your Irie Rasta way of life

358
00:11:30,409 --> 00:11:34,370
I'm an aspiring cannabis enthusiast

359
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,230
myself and I'm working on getting my

360
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:38,360
foot in the door of the cannabis

361
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:40,100
industry here in Connecticut for the

362
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,899
past few years I've been learning as

363
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:43,399
much about cannabis as I can before I

364
00:11:41,899 --> 00:11:46,039
enter either the medical or recreational

365
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:48,799
side of the industry when we establish a

366
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:50,480
rec side that is and I have to thank you

367
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:52,519
your friends and your podcast for

368
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:55,639
supplying me with a massive amount of

369
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:57,110
cannabis information and grow tips dude

370
00:11:55,639 --> 00:11:58,610
that's a huge compliment I hope that our

371
00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:00,379
podcast has put you on the right path

372
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:02,659
tour when you're able to get into a

373
00:12:00,379 --> 00:12:03,679
facility you could be a leader maybe you

374
00:12:02,659 --> 00:12:07,100
could be one of the bosses the

375
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:08,689
cultivation directors maybe since that's

376
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:10,040
new maybe you can just invent the phrase

377
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:11,480
you're like I'm cultivation director

378
00:12:10,039 --> 00:12:13,219
tell them so hon do that so I hope we

379
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,480
can get you your foot in the door when

380
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:16,519
the time comes

381
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,320
Connecticut huh I don't think I've ever

382
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:20,629
been to Connecticut I've been to a lot

383
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:23,110
of places and I cannot remember ever

384
00:12:20,629 --> 00:12:25,820
going to Connecticut for any reason I

385
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:26,959
don't think no no fish would be the only

386
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:28,879
thing that would take me that direction

387
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:30,919
I've never seen fish and Connecticut so

388
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:32,360
I remember that um let's see I'm gonna

389
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:34,009
continue with the email he says on a

390
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:35,778
separate note and the episode you put

391
00:12:34,009 --> 00:12:38,360
out this morning you asked to correct

392
00:12:35,778 --> 00:12:41,659
you if you got the THC THC a conversion

393
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:43,339
raw from what I remember the THC is what

394
00:12:41,659 --> 00:12:45,458
the trichomes start off as and they

395
00:12:43,339 --> 00:12:48,260
transform into THC when heating through

396
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:49,879
decarboxylation through curing most

397
00:12:48,259 --> 00:12:52,429
likely increases the psychoactive

398
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:54,528
potency of the trichomes since THC D

399
00:12:52,429 --> 00:12:57,769
carboxylates sorry I got to spin the

400
00:12:54,528 --> 00:13:00,860
page since DTC carboxylates

401
00:12:57,769 --> 00:13:02,269
where lie now in the form of water vapor

402
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:04,789
let me know if that was the solid

403
00:13:02,269 --> 00:13:06,948
knowledge man I'm not a scientist I hope

404
00:13:04,789 --> 00:13:08,689
the rest of your day is Irie brother

405
00:13:06,948 --> 00:13:11,120
take a phat dab and give your mom a hug

406
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:13,699
for me dude you were totally correct

407
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,470
what you said is completely correct so

408
00:13:13,698 --> 00:13:17,088
thanks for the correction as don't be

409
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:18,920
afraid to correct me if I say something

410
00:13:17,089 --> 00:13:21,740
stupid on the podcast if I say something

411
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:22,519
wrong please send me an email and let me

412
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,930
know that I don't

413
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:24,980
duh because it's the only way that I can

414
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:27,349
correct it and I don't want to teach

415
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:29,389
people the wrong way that's a big part

416
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:31,278
of why I started this podcast you guys I

417
00:13:29,389 --> 00:13:32,838
would be on the forums I'd be on the

418
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:33,950
internet I'd be in facebook groups and

419
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:35,690
then I would see people give the

420
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:37,970
shittiest advice people would be like

421
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:39,470
I'm in Week five in Flour and I've got

422
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:40,670
spider mites what do I do and somebody

423
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:43,220
would be like going there and spray

424
00:13:40,669 --> 00:13:44,958
floral my and I would just cringe like I

425
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:46,550
just now slapped myself in the face when

426
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:48,439
I read that I was like oh [ __ ] I just

427
00:13:46,549 --> 00:13:50,838
did the Macaulay Culkin like No

428
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:53,390
so that's part of what inspired me to do

429
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:55,100
this podcast was not trying not to pass

430
00:13:53,389 --> 00:13:57,470
along fake information and try to give

431
00:13:55,100 --> 00:14:00,170
useful information from experience

432
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:02,540
because I'm kind of uh I'm kind of a

433
00:14:00,169 --> 00:14:03,919
crazy grower if I have an idea and I

434
00:14:02,539 --> 00:14:05,569
think that something might improve my

435
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:07,490
crop the only way to find out if it's

436
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:08,930
gonna improve it is to do it and I

437
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:11,000
figure I've been growing long enough to

438
00:14:08,929 --> 00:14:11,989
where I've got a good foundation you

439
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,879
know I'm saying I can skateboard

440
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:15,230
I cannot skateboard this is an analogy I

441
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:16,789
can skateboard real well it's time to

442
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:18,080
hit the halfpipe so sometimes I'll go in

443
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:20,208
the grow room and do halfpipe tricks

444
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:22,459
I'll be like what if I just totally do

445
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:24,349
this and occasionally I [ __ ] up and kill

446
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:26,899
plants you guys but that's all part of

447
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:28,970
learning and experimenting I'm way

448
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:30,289
sidetracked I'm Way off my topic but if

449
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:31,639
I do something wrong if I say something

450
00:14:30,289 --> 00:14:32,778
wrong please do correct me jesse

451

457
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,110
better podcaster makes me a better

458
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,419
grower and it makes me a better teacher

459
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:48,919
and it humbles me so help me I do that

460

469
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,320
picked a few for this episode I'll do a

470
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:07,669
few more in the next couple of episodes

471
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:09,079
all right I feel like I'm talking really

472
00:15:07,669 --> 00:15:09,769
fast you guys I could probably use a

473
00:15:09,078 --> 00:15:11,750
drink of water

474
00:15:09,769 --> 00:15:13,250

475
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,870
I'm just gonna press pause I'm gonna

476
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:16,339
medicate myself I'm gonna hydrate myself

477
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:18,669
and I'll be back in just a couple of

478
00:15:16,339 --> 00:15:18,670
seconds

479
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:26,278
five cats world I am back I just took a

480
00:15:24,389 --> 00:15:28,470
couple of fat dabs of some Jack flash

481
00:15:26,278 --> 00:15:31,200
shatter from our friends at TR

482
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:32,460
concentrates super shatter II it's kind

483
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,810
of like the I said this before on a

484
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:36,570
previous episode it's kind of like the

485
00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:37,979
consistency of a Jolly Rancher if you

486
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:39,540
tried to break Jolly Ranchers with your

487
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,259
fingers it would just go popping and

488
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:42,809
flying everywhere

489
00:15:40,259 --> 00:15:44,519
it's kind of that hard consistency that

490
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:46,619
hard texture but it tastes really good

491
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:48,120
and obviously it gives me really rambley

492
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:50,100
high because I've been freaking talking

493
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:51,389
a million miles an hour in this episode

494
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:53,399
I want to thank you guys for listening

495
00:15:51,389 --> 00:15:55,889
to my rambles so I promised you guys

496
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:57,240
some grow tips and grow tricks but

497
00:15:55,889 --> 00:16:00,149
before I get that far I want to talk

498
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:01,649
about my most recent breeding project of

499
00:16:00,149 --> 00:16:04,079
course if you listen to the podcast you

500
00:16:01,649 --> 00:16:07,350
know I made some arise f2s I also

501
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:08,610
crossed a rise f12 Lemon skunk all of

502
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:10,528
those seeds have been harvested they've

503
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:13,379
all been dried out properly they're all

504
00:16:10,528 --> 00:16:14,399
in jars our friend Jesse was given a few

505
00:16:13,379 --> 00:16:16,259
of those the last time he was here

506
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,299
barefoot Grover was given a few of those

507
00:16:16,259 --> 00:16:20,669
when he was here for the podcast so some

508
00:16:18,299 --> 00:16:22,500
of those have gone out I'm working some

509
00:16:20,669 --> 00:16:24,120
of the new seeds into my growth schedule

510
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:26,009
so that I can grow some of those I'm

511
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:29,190
really really want to know what the

512
00:16:26,009 --> 00:16:30,929
arize f2 does but I really want to know

513
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:32,430
what that arises to lemon skunk is gonna

514
00:16:30,929 --> 00:16:34,709
do for me because everything I've

515
00:16:32,429 --> 00:16:37,979
crossed my lemon skunk female everything

516
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:39,629
has been amazing I also did arise to

517
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:41,009
grateful dog I'm super curious about

518
00:16:39,629 --> 00:16:43,350
that that one will probably not be

519
00:16:41,009 --> 00:16:44,460
released for a while I want to I want to

520
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:45,960
play with that one for a little bit by

521
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:47,639
myself and then I'll put it out in seed

522
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:49,320
form I have to make more of it I only

523
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:51,000
have a small handful of seeds of that

524
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:53,280
one the others I have a lot of seeds so

525
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,809
they'll go out so my new breeding

526
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,279
project ladies and gentlemen let me talk

527
00:16:54,809 --> 00:16:58,769
more about that I am using the same

528
00:16:56,279 --> 00:17:00,659
arise mail I've gotten a rise mail he is

529
00:16:58,769 --> 00:17:02,338
a stud if you follow me on instagram you

530
00:17:00,659 --> 00:17:04,349
have seen this dude on instagram he

531
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:05,970
grows for a male plant he grows some of

532
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:07,708
the biggest colas the biggest male

533
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:10,140
flowers I've ever seen

534
00:17:07,709 --> 00:17:12,810
he puts resin out he smells terrible

535
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:15,150
he's got this really funky stank to him

536
00:17:12,809 --> 00:17:18,119
which is a good thing for a male a rise

537
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:20,519
is golden goat was the female and

538
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:22,169
Daybreaker from gage green genetics was

539
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:25,859
the male Daybreaker

540
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:28,110
is Kim D and Joseph Oh G so those are

541
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:30,240
the ones that the Joseph Oh G chem D

542
00:17:28,109 --> 00:17:32,459
cross - golden goat which is island

543
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:35,789
sweet skunk Hawaiian sativa and Romulan

544
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:37,259
so it's such a good combo mm-hmm arises

545
00:17:35,789 --> 00:17:41,549
a great strain I made I took the mail

546
00:17:37,259 --> 00:17:42,990
and now the Mail's are in flower this

547
00:17:41,549 --> 00:17:44,970
podcast will go out for quite some time

548
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:48,120
but the Mail's are now in flower they

549
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:50,880
went into flower yesterday and I've got

550
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:53,729
two huts with other plants in them

551
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,590
two five by five huts with two gallon

552
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:57,630
pots and the huts are crammed pretty

553
00:17:55,589 --> 00:17:59,159
tight there's two gallon pots stuff in

554
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:59,840
those Hut's and there are cookies and

555
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:02,400
cream

556
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:04,049
females cookies and cream females white

557
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,320
widow females there's lemon skunk

558
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:09,359
females there's a lemon Jeffrey in there

559
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:10,349
there is there are a couple others in

560
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:11,939
there that I don't even need to mention

561
00:18:10,349 --> 00:18:13,469
yet but we'll talk about those later in

562
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,600
the future those are probably going to

563
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:18,269
go into flour

564
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:19,500
maybe Monday but anyway pretty soon

565
00:18:18,269 --> 00:18:20,789
those are gonna go into flour here I'm

566
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,799
letting I need the mail to get ahead

567
00:18:20,789 --> 00:18:24,149
just a little tiny bit but I don't want

568
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,950
my girls to get too big and they're

569
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:27,660
starting to kind of get tall so I need

570
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:29,460
to I need to time this out just right

571
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:31,350
but I'm gonna keep the mail separate I'm

572
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:32,759
gonna let em flour out are there two

573
00:18:31,349 --> 00:18:34,619
male plants it's the same stream but I

574
00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:36,119
just need enough pollen to do two huts

575
00:18:34,619 --> 00:18:38,609
so I've got two male plants in there

576
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:40,289
they're flowering I'm gonna keep them

577
00:18:38,609 --> 00:18:43,019
separate to keep that pollen in there

578
00:18:40,289 --> 00:18:44,460
and then around day 25 ish depending on

579
00:18:43,019 --> 00:18:47,490
how the plants look I'm gonna go and

580
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:49,650
pollinate 25 of a flower for the girls

581
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:51,930
I'm gonna go in and pollinate both of

582
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:53,310
the 5x5 Hut's worth of plants and then

583
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:54,330
we'll make a bunch of new crosses so

584
00:18:53,309 --> 00:18:56,609
that's what's going on my breeding

585
00:18:54,329 --> 00:18:58,379
projects I like to keep you guys updated

586
00:18:56,609 --> 00:19:00,509
assume you guys really care some of you

587
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:01,920
guys probably don't care at all so let's

588
00:19:00,509 --> 00:19:03,690
move on to some grow tips like I talked

589
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:06,350
about you guys I've been talking about

590
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:08,880
growing in Ko Ko Ko are a whole bunch

591
00:19:06,349 --> 00:19:10,589
I've experimented with several brands of

592
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,410
cocoa I've experimented with different

593
00:19:10,589 --> 00:19:15,959
nutrient feeds in cocoa I do love cocoa

594
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:17,670
I love the cocoa but one thing that

595
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:19,950
sucks is if you don't mix something in

596
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:21,390
with it it kind of compresses a little

597
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:23,970
bit it kind of gets to be too much

598
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:26,190
around your roots and I feel like the

599
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:27,839
plants that I did in all cocoa could

600
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:30,150
have harvested better had I mixed

601
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:32,000
something into that soil I don't like

602
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:33,960
the cocoa that I used I think the plants

603
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,849
probably could have been a little bit

604
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:39,090
better so if you're gonna grow in cocoa

605
00:19:35,849 --> 00:19:41,730
mix in maybe 50 percent soil or maybe

606
00:19:39,089 --> 00:19:44,279
mix in a whole bunch of perlite because

607
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:46,319
I've used a couple brands of cocoa

608
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:49,049
and some of them compress a whole bunch

609
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:50,039
some of them don't and it's hard to tell

610
00:19:49,049 --> 00:19:51,480
when they're in the bag and I'm not

611
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:53,879
gonna call out brands I've just learned

612
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:56,759
that I want to mix my cocoa with some

613
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:58,320
soil and or some perlite so that's

614
00:19:56,759 --> 00:20:00,299
something I would recommend my babies my

615
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:01,829
clones hated going into cocoa they just

616
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:03,240
died they were like no [ __ ] you that's

617
00:20:01,829 --> 00:20:05,699
too much pressure on the roots there's

618
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:08,490
no air in here I'm going to die and so I

619
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:09,840
make some 5050 with soil and threw it in

620
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:12,210
there and they grew but they weren't

621
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:15,240
happy and then I put some just into

622
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:18,059
straight soil soilless mix that I make

623
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:20,579
for babies they had no cocoa in it and

624
00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:22,950
those plants took off so start your

625
00:20:20,579 --> 00:20:24,000
babies in some soil maybe unless you get

626
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:25,319
them really going unless you're coming

627
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,910
from rock wool then it might work I'm

628
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:28,019
coming out of an easy corner of course

629
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:31,890
this is what happened from the easy

630
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:34,319
cloner so I think soil or a 50/50 mix is

631
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:36,030
better than just straight-up cocoa so

632
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:38,490
that's something I wanted to mention to

633
00:20:36,029 --> 00:20:39,779
you guys through experience let's see

634
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:41,670
one of our friends it listens to the

635
00:20:39,779 --> 00:20:42,990
podcast was posting on Facebook that

636
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:45,539
he's got a stream that takes a really

637
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:47,339
long time to flower and it's way late

638
00:20:45,539 --> 00:20:49,369
into flower already and it does not show

639
00:20:47,339 --> 00:20:51,929
any signs of slowing down and being done

640
00:20:49,369 --> 00:20:54,000
and he was just asking questions you

641
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:56,250
want to know WTF like what the [ __ ] is

642
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,380
going on with this plant dude and so my

643
00:20:56,250 --> 00:21:01,289
guidance my advice was to reduce the

644
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:03,240
lights on that plant to speed up the

645
00:21:01,289 --> 00:21:05,970
flowering cycle that plant is waiting

646
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:07,500
for a signal to say hey are you done yet

647
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:09,660
just waiting for something to hint at it

648
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:11,940
that the season is over wherever that

649
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:13,259
plant it's hard to even guess where that

650
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:16,110
plant came from I don't know what strain

651
00:21:13,259 --> 00:21:19,039
you're working with but that plant comes

652
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:23,069
from an area or the day and night cycle

653
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:27,690
between the winter and summer seasons

654
00:21:23,069 --> 00:21:28,859
does not vary very much so the what it

655
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:30,269
takes to make those plants flower

656
00:21:28,859 --> 00:21:32,609
they're very sensitive they'll flower

657
00:21:30,269 --> 00:21:33,869
very easily sometimes those plants those

658
00:21:32,609 --> 00:21:36,000
type of plants if they get root bound

659
00:21:33,869 --> 00:21:37,559
they'll flower if they get crowded

660
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,039
they're not getting enough light they'll

661
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:40,139
flower

662
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:41,759
so those they're cool because they'll

663
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:42,990
start flowering very easily when you're

664
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:44,220
ready if you put them in the flower room

665
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:46,589
you'll notice sometimes those will show

666
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:48,329
flower earliest but also they don't want

667
00:21:46,589 --> 00:21:49,679
to finish so since the season doesn't

668
00:21:48,329 --> 00:21:51,929
change let me get back on track err my

669
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:53,279
mind is racing today since the season

670
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:54,660
doesn't change very much those plants

671
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:56,129
can pretty much just go on until they

672
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:58,050
wither up and die is what would happen

673
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:58,260
in nature and that's what they want to

674
00:21:58,049 --> 00:21:59,279
do

675
00:21:58,259 --> 00:22:00,629
you're gonna keep going until they

676
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:02,309
receive pollen they're just like hey

677
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:03,570
pollinate me pollinate me please please

678
00:22:02,309 --> 00:22:05,129
please and there's gonna grow until they

679
00:22:03,569 --> 00:22:07,259
fry themselves out so you've got to

680
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:09,180
reduce the lights to give them a hint

681
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:11,160
that oh [ __ ] grow season's over I better

682
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:12,539
finish up and that's what you got to do

683
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:15,269
turn the life you're on twelve twelve

684
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:16,769
turn the lights down to maybe just give

685
00:22:15,269 --> 00:22:19,889
them ten hours of light a day instead of

686
00:22:16,769 --> 00:22:21,420
twelve go ten fourteen I and just do

687
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:22,860
that for two weeks and I'm sure they'll

688
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:24,870
start finishing up they may be finished

689
00:22:22,859 --> 00:22:27,089
up in two weeks from doing that so maybe

690
00:22:24,869 --> 00:22:28,500
start flushing reduce the lights that's

691
00:22:27,089 --> 00:22:30,449
something that will certainly help you

692
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,930
with a strain that is taking way too

693
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:32,460
long

694
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:35,160
I had a Durbin poison strain that took

695
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:36,420
like 16 weeks to flower properly when I

696
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,840
started chopping down the lights a

697
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:38,759
little bit

698
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:41,459
it certainly sped up the time I cut off

699
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:43,829
two full weeks if I did it two weeks if

700
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:44,970
I timed it properly that grove is a long

701
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:46,679
time ago I don't even [ __ ] with that

702
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:49,500
Durbin poison anymore was kind of a mess

703
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:51,570
no need for that share of my garden you

704
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:53,700
may have a good urban poison cut no no

705
00:22:51,569 --> 00:22:56,099
offense to yours but the one I had no I

706
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:57,600
did not want to work with all right so

707
00:22:56,099 --> 00:22:59,909
another thing

708
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:03,089
everybody got not everybody a lot of

709
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:05,550
people got powdery mildew last winter

710
00:23:03,089 --> 00:23:07,169
and the winter is coming and I don't

711
00:23:05,549 --> 00:23:08,609
want you to get powdery mildew again so

712
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:11,310
let's talk about some ways that you can

713
00:23:08,609 --> 00:23:12,929
prevent powdery mildew that's going to

714
00:23:11,309 --> 00:23:14,220
that possibly happens because it's

715
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:16,019
winter time you guys when it gets cold

716
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:17,819
outside and it stays warm inside so

717
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:19,319
you're growing growing cannabis indoors

718
00:23:17,819 --> 00:23:20,909
right a lot of you are in a basement a

719
00:23:19,319 --> 00:23:22,769
lot of you are in a warehouse

720
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:24,150
you've probably got one concrete wall

721
00:23:22,769 --> 00:23:26,339
somewhere that your plants are really

722
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:28,200
close to the outside of that wall is

723
00:23:26,339 --> 00:23:31,079
going to get temperatures that are

724
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:32,819
really ridiculously low the opposite

725
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:35,129
side of that wall you got a beautiful

726
00:23:32,819 --> 00:23:36,929
grow environment so when that moisture

727
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:38,640
builds up on the outside makes that

728
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:41,009
weird cold wall and then the heat hits

729
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,460
it a lot of law to grow rooms I see it

730
00:23:41,009 --> 00:23:43,049
happen

731
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:45,150
it's happened to me the first time I

732
00:23:43,049 --> 00:23:46,440
moved into this one house that I grew in

733
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:48,090
this one basement they had a concrete

734
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:49,320
wall the plant we've talked about it

735
00:23:48,089 --> 00:23:51,089
before that plant in that corner where

736
00:23:49,319 --> 00:23:53,069
the concrete corner was it got

737
00:23:51,089 --> 00:23:55,349
completely powdery mildew all up that

738
00:23:53,069 --> 00:23:57,480
one side I was at another facility that

739
00:23:55,349 --> 00:23:59,039
had a garage door type of thing and

740
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,420
right there in that area those plants

741
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:03,210
started getting powdery mildew on the

742
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:04,800
first snowfall so something you can do

743
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:06,210
something you're gonna need to think

744
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:08,609
about is how to heat those areas

745
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:10,110
properly maybe build a separate wall I

746
00:24:08,609 --> 00:24:12,149
know this sounds extreme but if you've

747
00:24:10,109 --> 00:24:14,939
got a wall if your grow facility

748
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:16,470
has a wall that is on the exterior of

749
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:18,840
the building and it is concrete or it is

750
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:20,490
not well insulated you may want to build

751
00:24:18,839 --> 00:24:22,019
a six-inch gap in there and put some

752
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:24,210
insulation in there so that when it

753
00:24:22,019 --> 00:24:25,470
snows you've got a buffer zone so that

754
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:27,150
you're not freezing your plants

755
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:28,950
something else you can do to help

756
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:30,930
prevent powdery mildew and this is just

757
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:32,460
for all seasons when the plants start

758
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:34,080
going into flower and getting a little

759
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:37,860
bit of chunky buds I like to go in and

760
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:39,419
take off most of the big fan leaves most

761
00:24:37,859 --> 00:24:40,649
of those water leaves the Sun leaves

762
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:42,810
whatever you want to call them I like to

763
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:44,430
pull the majority of those off some

764
00:24:42,809 --> 00:24:46,500
people think that I'm crazy some people

765
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:49,140
think I'm nuts for doing it but go in

766
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:51,299
there about week three a flower and take

767
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:53,310
off all those pea Deol's and watch them

768
00:24:51,299 --> 00:24:54,779
grow back you'll freak out because they

769
00:24:53,309 --> 00:24:56,579
come back your plants will be way more

770
00:24:54,779 --> 00:24:57,960
productive you'll see production and

771
00:24:56,579 --> 00:25:00,000
what you're doing is you're letting the

772
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:02,490
light penetrate a little bit more you

773
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,019
can get white down to the bottom buds to

774
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:06,089
where you don't have to lollipop is high

775
00:25:04,019 --> 00:25:07,740
and you're also creating more airspace

776
00:25:06,089 --> 00:25:10,019
and at the same time you're removing

777
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:12,059
places for powdery mildew to land and

778
00:25:10,019 --> 00:25:13,710
build up and a lot of times what happens

779
00:25:12,059 --> 00:25:16,470
you guys in a warm humid grow room

780
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:18,630
you've got one leaf and another leaf

781
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:20,970
resting right on top of each other now

782
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:22,710
imagine if you imagine you're on the bus

783
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:24,420
and the dude next to you just rests his

784
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:26,670
[ __ ] hand right on yours on the bus

785
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:28,350
in the middle of the summer and his hand

786
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:31,140
is sweating and your hand is sweating

787
00:25:28,349 --> 00:25:32,459
and you got to ride all day twelve hours

788
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:33,900
yeah you got fans going on in there but

789
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:36,120
there's this area sometimes where the

790
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:37,650
fans don't hit every single leaf so you

791
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:40,949
got to ride in there for 12 hours with

792
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:43,080
the lights on you imagine how sticky and

793
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:45,210
funky your hand is gonna be after 12

794
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:47,879
hours of that [ __ ] the top leaf is

795
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:49,470
sweating from on the bottom because all

796
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,940
that leaf pressed against it the bottom

797
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:51,960
leaf is sweating from the top is all

798
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:53,880
that leaf against it and you're just

799
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:56,910
creating funk inside of there powdery

800
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:58,740
mildew will pop up from that so if you

801
00:25:56,910 --> 00:26:00,540
pull off all these extra leaves you

802
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:02,279
eliminate the opportunity for that

803
00:26:00,539 --> 00:26:03,629
powdery mildew to develop under your

804
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:05,700
leaves so that's something that's really

805
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:07,320
helpful I think also there's less places

806
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:09,240
for bugs if you go in there and you pull

807
00:26:07,319 --> 00:26:10,919
off all the leaves it's way less

808
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:13,140
opportunity for bugs to hide the bugs

809
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:14,340
prefer those leaves with longer pee

810
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:16,050
deals that stick out a little bit

811
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:17,849
further they like to go right underneath

812
00:26:16,049 --> 00:26:19,079
those real big-ass leaves and hang out

813
00:26:17,849 --> 00:26:21,000
it's the first place you're gonna see

814
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:23,939
bug damages on the low larger leaves I

815
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,859
think most of the time so eliminate that

816
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:27,840
[ __ ] get rid of it don't even give the

817
00:26:25,859 --> 00:26:29,329
an opportunity to get their also clean

818
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:31,889
up the bottoms of your plants you guys

819
00:26:29,329 --> 00:26:34,798
nothing should touch the pot or the

820
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:35,880
floor or the dirt like no none of the

821
00:26:34,798 --> 00:26:36,900
stuff that's hanging off the bottom of

822
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,309
your plant should really touch that

823
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,750
clean that up if you can get in there

824
00:26:38,308 --> 00:26:41,009
with some scissors at the early start a

825
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:43,079
flower just clean it up you want

826
00:26:41,009 --> 00:26:45,240
depending on the size of pot and size

827
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:47,369
apply or use it I usually have at least

828
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:50,429
six to eight inches between the pot and

829
00:26:47,369 --> 00:26:52,709
the first two stalks that come off my

830
00:26:50,429 --> 00:26:54,000
branch I will clean that up sometimes if

831
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:55,429
I'm going on a larger pot and around

832
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,450
larger plants I'll clean a foot

833
00:26:55,429 --> 00:26:59,009
sometimes a green and healthy when I had

834
00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:00,840
the large warehouse we would over veg

835
00:26:59,009 --> 00:27:02,759
for too long and then we would just

836
00:27:00,839 --> 00:27:04,740
trellis everything out and then stuff

837
00:27:02,759 --> 00:27:06,298
that didn't reach I would just chop off

838
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:08,370
all the branches that didn't reach to

839
00:27:06,298 --> 00:27:10,200
the trellis and we'd have a foot and a

840
00:27:08,369 --> 00:27:12,529
half or just naked shaved legs sometimes

841
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:14,970
two feet I just naked bare shaved legs

842
00:27:12,529 --> 00:27:16,889
but that promotes better air flow and

843
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:18,779
again it gives you less opportunity for

844
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:20,730
bugs to get in there less places for

845
00:27:18,779 --> 00:27:22,319
powdery mildew and we're not trying to

846
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:25,259
grow leaves we're trying to go grow buds

847
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:26,879
so get in there about week three excuse

848
00:27:25,259 --> 00:27:28,589
me get in there about week three take

849
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,000
off most of your family if not all of

850
00:27:28,589 --> 00:27:31,589
them I like to leave the two on the top

851
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,240
of the but you know you've got that top

852
00:27:31,589 --> 00:27:34,859
cola I like to leave two or four leaves

853
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:36,509
up there so you can grab some light

854
00:27:34,859 --> 00:27:38,399
create some energy but that lower stuff

855
00:27:36,509 --> 00:27:39,869
just go mad I take most of that lower

856
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:42,150
[ __ ] right off I don't even think about

857
00:27:39,869 --> 00:27:43,500
it then I get in there about week five

858
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:46,110
and do it again I'll feed it a balloon

859
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:48,960
booster I will feed it a root pack and a

860
00:27:46,109 --> 00:27:50,819
foliar pack to make it explode excuse

861
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,140
the throat clearing you guys shout out

862
00:27:50,819 --> 00:27:55,230
to tiara concentrates with their Chad

863
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:57,150
flash hash huge fat dabs made me a

864
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:58,529
little choked up but I like to get in

865
00:27:57,150 --> 00:28:00,690
there and take off the leaves feed it a

866
00:27:58,529 --> 00:28:02,369
root pack feeder to foal your pack feed

867
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:04,169
it a strong bloom booster about week

868
00:28:02,369 --> 00:28:06,479
five week six and then go there and pull

869
00:28:04,169 --> 00:28:08,460
off the leaves you'll really notice it

870
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:11,400
bulk up that's my opinion indica strains

871
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:12,840
really like it flow blueberry that type

872
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:14,460
of stuff really appreciates it some of

873
00:28:12,839 --> 00:28:16,649
the sativa dominant strains don't go

874
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:19,259
super heavy but good still get in there

875
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:21,120
and take off some leaves alright that's

876
00:28:19,259 --> 00:28:23,160
what I think about defoliation also

877
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:24,629
Jessie and I did an episode we talked

878
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:27,720
about cleaning up your outdoor garden

879
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:30,090
clean up your indoor garden you guys get

880
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:31,529
a broom and sweep up just why not sweep

881
00:28:30,089 --> 00:28:32,009
up at the end of the day you've got to

882
00:28:31,529 --> 00:28:33,599
be there

883
00:28:32,009 --> 00:28:35,579
spend an extra five or ten minutes and

884
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:37,049
sweep up that place pick up all the

885
00:28:35,579 --> 00:28:39,000
little litter that lands in the grow

886
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:39,750
room maybe there's a zip tie that you

887
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,609
used for something

888
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:43,019
you cut down clean that [ __ ] up there's

889
00:28:41,609 --> 00:28:44,849
no need to leave extra stuff sitting

890
00:28:43,019 --> 00:28:46,109
around put all your tools away put all

891
00:28:44,849 --> 00:28:48,089
your equipment away clean out your

892
00:28:46,109 --> 00:28:49,740
sprayers clean out your pumps clean out

893
00:28:48,089 --> 00:28:51,089
anything maybe clay can be clean so that

894
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:52,799
it's ready for you the next time you

895
00:28:51,089 --> 00:28:54,029
need to use it just take a couple

896
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:56,279
minutes at the end of the day and clean

897
00:28:54,029 --> 00:28:58,470
[ __ ] up if you're drawn at home you guys

898
00:28:56,279 --> 00:29:00,359
have dedicated stuff have a dedicated

899
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:03,450
broom have a dedicated dustpan for your

900
00:29:00,359 --> 00:29:05,609
grow rooms try to have a dedicated trash

901
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:06,930
can when you clean up when you sweep up

902
00:29:05,609 --> 00:29:09,119
if you've got dead leaves on the floor

903
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:10,759
if you find that you've got some dead

904
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:12,929
bugs on the floor sometimes you'll find

905
00:29:10,759 --> 00:29:14,339
randomly just to be a little pilot dead

906
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:15,900
like white flies or fungus gnats or

907
00:29:14,339 --> 00:29:17,099
something maybe you sprayed and then few

908
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:18,960
days later all these bugs dad they just

909
00:29:17,099 --> 00:29:20,939
all landed over there by that fan when

910
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,769
you clean that stuff up sweep it all up

911
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:24,360
into a trash can and take that trash can

912
00:29:22,769 --> 00:29:26,549
out of the grow room don't leave it in

913
00:29:24,359 --> 00:29:28,319
the grow if you got dead leaves in there

914
00:29:26,549 --> 00:29:30,299
don't leave those in the grow either you

915
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:31,710
don't want that stuff in there every

916
00:29:30,299 --> 00:29:33,930
dead leave and piece of stuff on the

917
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:35,880
floor is another place for a bug to hide

918
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:37,380
and I said this to somebody the other

919
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:39,390
day I said if you got five spider mites

920
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:41,070
hiding underneath one leaf two of them

921
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:42,570
are gonna hook up - am I gonna [ __ ] and

922
00:29:41,069 --> 00:29:44,939
they're gonna make a million spider my

923
00:29:42,569 --> 00:29:47,039
babies and if you do the math on that

924
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:48,390
cuz it's just gonna keep going so man I

925
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:49,649
mean I'm right right if you got five

926
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:51,509
people at a party by the end of the

927
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:52,680
night two people are hooking up and

928
00:29:51,509 --> 00:29:54,839
that's how these spider mites are gonna

929
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:56,880
be and if you leave one leaf and you got

930
00:29:54,839 --> 00:29:58,769
five spider mites under there and five

931
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,090
days you're gonna have that x whatever

932
00:29:58,769 --> 00:30:02,009
spider mites breed out which is a

933
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:03,449
ridiculous rate so clean up that one

934
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:04,950
leaf just pick it up there's no need for

935
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:07,289
all that [ __ ] around there get out the

936
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:09,420
shop back and clean up the corners dust

937
00:30:07,289 --> 00:30:10,889
the tops of the lights go in you will be

938
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:12,570
amazed at how many bugs are in the

939
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:14,430
crevices in your Gavita lights if you've

940
00:30:12,569 --> 00:30:15,720
got a large commercial facility and you

941
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:17,519
get up top and you clean out your lights

942
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:19,079
there's a bunch of bugs up there clean

943
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:20,519
all that [ __ ] out it's nasty you don't

944
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:21,599
want to have that in there also clean

945
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:23,970
your fans while you're at it

946
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:25,619

947
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:27,089
feel like that's enough info enough tips

948
00:30:25,619 --> 00:30:28,619

prevention management identification and

954
00:30:36,329 --> 00:30:39,929

of a whole bunch of bugs a whole bunch

956

of different situations it's gonna be a

957
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:44,940
multi showpiece trying to write out at

958
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:47,400
least two full episodes before I get it

959
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:48,809
started I like to get ahead of myself

960
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:50,070
speaking of episodes I've got written

961
00:30:48,809 --> 00:30:53,009
out and I'm getting ahead of myself with

962
00:30:50,069 --> 00:30:53,589
I've got a debate about organics versus

963
00:30:53,009 --> 00:30:55,419
I don't know if it

964
00:30:53,589 --> 00:30:57,009
debate but whatever the pros and cons of

965
00:30:55,419 --> 00:30:58,659
organics versus synthetics and I've got

966
00:30:57,009 --> 00:31:00,369
a lot of other great stuff coming up for

967
