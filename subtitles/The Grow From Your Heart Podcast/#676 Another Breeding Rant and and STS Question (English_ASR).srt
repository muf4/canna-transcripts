65
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:29,598
being in the greenhouse if you've been

66
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,360
watching the show i'm sure you've heard

67
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:32,799
me talk about the greenhouse project

68
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,200
i've got going on that's right i did

69
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,519
some breeding in a greenhouse i was at

70
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:39,359
the greenhouse earlier today my fingers

71
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:42,080
are still sticky my arm hair is still

72
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,000
sticky but i am super excited because

73
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,400
the seeds that are happening in that

74
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
greenhouse are almost ready they're

75
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,760
getting super hard they're getting a

76
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
nice dark color to them they're getting

77
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:54,318
some tiger stripes they look really

78
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,878
really good i'm really excited so pretty

79
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:59,439
soon we will have some outdoor bred irie

80
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:00,719
genetic seeds i was amazed i've talked

81
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:02,400
about this before on the show i'm just

82
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:03,840
kind of talking about it again because

83
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,200
i'm excited i like to give you guys

84
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,280
updates on what's going on with my

85
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:09,598
projects uh bring you in make you feel

86
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,479
included but i am super excited those

87
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:14,479
plants happened much more quickly than i

88
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:16,959
expected it to happen they were ready

89
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:18,399
for pollen earlier than i anticipated uh

90
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,920
the pollen dumped earlier than

91
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,640
anticipated

92
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:24,639
the seeds hardened up much more quickly

93
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:26,958
so i learned a lot this year with our

94
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:28,238
inaugural outdoor run people have been

95
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,598
asking a lot of questions since i've

96
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,200
been hinting about what i put out there

97
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:32,798
i'll give you a couple of a couple of

98
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:35,679
ideas of what went out there this year i

99
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,360
did put an arise male the king solomon

100
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,400
male was in the greenhouse so everything

101
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,159
that got pollinated uh was pollinated by

102
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,599
king solomon the first male that i

103
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:45,439
should talk about that we put out there

104
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:47,439
was the platinum tangy why did i put

105
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:50,318
platinum tangy out there because that

106
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:52,158
makes sun-kissed seeds i'm very familiar

107
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:54,560
with the platinum tangy plant and i'm

108
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:56,239
very familiar with the sun-kissed cross

109
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,479
so i'll be able to tell what that

110
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,560
platinum tangy plant is doing outdoors

111
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:02,560
compared to what it does indoors then

112
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,318
once the seeds are made i've got plenty

113
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,318
of that makes sun kisses what that makes

114
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:08,560
i've got plenty of sun-kissed seeds that

115
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:10,958
were made indoors now i've got sun kiss

116
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,519
made outdoors now the next move is to

117
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,759
grow both of those in similar conditions

118
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,439
and see if the outdoor produced seeds

119
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:19,358
show any difference than the indoor

120
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:22,079
produced seeds of the same cross they

121
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:23,599
use the same exact genetics but one was

122
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,918
made indoors one was made in a

123
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,320
greenhouse i personally honestly

124
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:30,639
realistically do not know if we will see

125
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:31,759
any difference in the expression um

126
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,240
there were different things in the

127
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,319
environment which may uh fall in line in

128
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,759
epigenetics or i don't know how it may

129
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:39,279
work they may there may be differences

130
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,520
what is what i'm saying and i want to

131
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:43,279
grow them i'm excited to find out so we

132
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:45,279
started off with that platinum tangy

133
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:46,959
outdoors there is a blueberry cookies

134
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:49,039
plant outdoor so that we can make more

135
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:50,638
blue raspberry truffle a lot of people

136
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,120
are asking for blue raspberry truffle

137
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,519
seeds we're making some outdoors there

138
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,519
is a mandarin sunset plant outside so we

139
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:59,120
can make more of the lady marmalade

140
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:01,038
there are some new things some things

141
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,639
that i'm making brand new crosses of and

142
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:04,399
there are others out there that we don't

143
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:07,120
need to talk about right now i do like

144
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:08,560
leaving a little bit of suspense got to

145
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,840
build that suspense a little bit we'll

146
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,839
talk more about what's out there in the

147
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:13,519
future but i wanted to kind of tease you

148
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:14,959
a little bit they're getting the seeds

149
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:18,799
are getting hard the buds are getting

150
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:20,239
fat they're so sticky and so stinky

151
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,919
i was out there at the greenhouse and

152
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,840
then i had to run a couple of errands

153
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:25,839
and everywhere i went after that they

154
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:27,679
gave me dirty looks because i was

155
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:30,319
stinking so good it was beautiful it's a

156
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,959
beautiful aroma but it went so fast it

157
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:34,959
happened so quickly i was amazed so next

158
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:37,279
year we're going to do things a little

159
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:39,120
bit but a lot a bit differently and we

160
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:41,439
should produce two or three times as

161
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,280
many seeds next year i'm excited get

162
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:44,959
excited with me because pretty soon i

163
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:46,799
will be sending these seeds out for

164
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:48,638
testers all right now i do want to take

198
00:06:55,598 --> 00:06:59,519
and really briefly i'll just explain why

199
00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:01,038
we call him white mike uh mike is my

200
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:02,719
buddy that i'm a white guy with

201
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:03,680
dreadlocks i know that that's a cliche

202
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,599
thing but i'm the white guy with

203
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,280
dreadlocks smoking a fat joint with the

204
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:09,439
music too loud in the car driving too

205
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:11,439
fast and mike will politely remind me

206
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:13,120
he'll say hey buddy you're the white guy

207
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:15,439
with dreadlocks with the music too loud

208
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,038
smoking a joint driving too fast pick

209
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:18,319
one or two of those and only do one or

210
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:20,079
two of those at a time or you're gonna

211
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,759
go to jail today and i'd be like yeah

212
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:23,120
you're kind of right buddy and so it's

213
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,960
kind of a joke that i call him white

214
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,120
mike he's just just make sure to follow

215
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:29,359
the rules he's a super uptight white guy

216
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,280
but i need that on my team because i'm

217
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,560
the [ __ ] opposite we create a good

218
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:33,839
balance

219
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,720
so that's why you got the name white

220
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:36,399
mike

221
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,280
just a white dude super he listens to

222
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:40,879
311 and where's jenko's uh what more

223
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:42,159
white dude could you ask for right big

224
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:44,319
shout out to my buddy white mike nothing

225

be here without mike's encouragement

going well it says here i enjoyed

248
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,080
listening to your girl from your heart

249
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:35,278
podcast shows and recently i stumbled

250
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:37,200
upon episode 602 where you speak in

251
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:39,599
detail about the silver thiosulfate

252
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,599
recipe and the method used in creating

253
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,800
your solution yes thank you for

254
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,480
listening bro i'm hoping that that's

255
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,759
working well for you i hope you're on

256
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,519
the path to making some silver

257
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:49,360
thiosulfate and some femme seeds and

258
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:52,799
thank you for listening by the way it

259
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:54,639
does say here is my question upon mixing

260
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:56,559
the two-part solution together this

261
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:58,240
solution is further diluted to a

262
00:08:56,559 --> 00:09:00,319
one-to-nine ratio sounds like you're on

263
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,480
the right path we've made one liter and

264
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,480
we use up to 100 milliliters so yeah if

265
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,399
you got a one to nine um you didn't

266
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,800
mention anything about storing the other

267
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:11,039
900 milliliters that is a good uh good

268
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:12,879
point to bring up can this solution be

269
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:16,319
stored if so what's the best practice

270
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:18,399
for storage and what is the shelf life

271
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,560
yes you can store that solution the best

272
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,639
practice would be to keep it cold the

273
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:24,559
colder the better uh the colder you can

274
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:26,080
keep that solution the better it is

275
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:27,679
ideally and i probably should have

276
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,639
mentioned this before we got to this

277
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:32,000
point ideally it would store better uh

278
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:34,399
let me start from the very very

279
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,720
beginning we're gonna do a good better

280
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:39,759
best sort of situation here they store

281
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,920
better as powders non-diluted into

282
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:43,919
anything the powder by itself in the

283
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:45,278
refrigerator in a cool dry dark place is

284
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:48,000
the best way to store it so keep the

285
00:09:45,278 --> 00:09:50,399
powder stored that lasts forever then

286
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,200
the next longest storage method is to

287
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:55,679
have uh part a and part b mixed into the

288
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,839
water but not mixed together those will

289
00:09:55,679 --> 00:10:00,719
last longer then when you mix them

290
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,920
together they last a little bit less

291
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,240
time so i hope i said that in the

292
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:05,599
correct manner uh don't mix them they

293
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,959
last the longest

294
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,959
parts a and b

295
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:10,799
the powder into the water will last a

296
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:12,319
little less longer and then once you

297
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:15,359
cross them all together mix them all

298
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,440
together it lasts even less longer so um

299
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,360
the best way possible would be keep it

300
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,200
powder then keep them divided then once

301
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,959
you mix it you can store it in a cool

302
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,800
dry dark place like the refrigerator

303
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:26,719
i've got a jar in the fridge now an

304
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:28,559
important important note if you're going

305
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,759
to put your silver thiosulfate in the

306
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:34,239
refrigerator make sure to clearly mark

307
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:36,000
what that stuff is it is clear it's

308
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,320
odorless we don't want anybody drinking

309
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,320
it i do not think it would be harmful if

310
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,720
you took a couple of swigs out of that

311
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,560
but let's not give that any risk let's

312
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,399
not give that an opportunity clearly

313
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:48,078
label that silver thiosulfate if you've

314
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,399
got children in the house people that

315
00:10:48,078 --> 00:10:52,078
can't read people that drink i'm not

316
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,000
trying to judge anybody but let's set

317
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:56,319
them up for success let's set ourselves

318
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,399
up for success let's clearly label that

319
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,160
that is silver thiosulfate maybe put a

320
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,919
ring of tape around the the rim of the

321
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:03,679
jar or the bottle so that nobody can

322
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:04,639
easily pull that open so if they do open

323
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:06,559
it they go why the [ __ ] is there

324
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:08,639
electrical tape or duct tape on my my

325
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:10,239
moonshine or my jar of water here make

326
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:12,000
them think another step before they pour

327
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,600
that silver thiosulfate down their golet

328
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,480
and make themselves sick and blame it on

329
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,920
you

330
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,440
set yourself up for success set

331
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:19,199
everybody in your house up for success

332
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,720
by clearly labeling the silver

333
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,200
thiosulfate that is stored in your

334
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,040
fridge mine is in a bag and then it's

335
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,320
labeled and then it's clear i'm the only

336
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:27,838
one here that goes in the fridge nobody

337
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,959
else is going in there so if anybody

338
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:31,279
else goes in there drink it they're an

339
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:32,799
intruder and uh they can have the

340
00:11:31,278 --> 00:11:35,120
diarrhea that it gives them i'm proud of

341
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:37,039
them um so you can store it in the

342
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,440
fridge is the best way cool dry dark

343
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:42,000
place it stores where well cold you know

344
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:44,640
i've never honestly stored any for too

345
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,480
long i make the one to nine ratio and

346
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:47,759
then i use the hundred milliliters and

347
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,920
that you're correct and then i make the

348
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:51,679
bottle a spray and then i spray the

349
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:53,439
plant but then i use that again in three

350
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:55,199
days i pour more of that into the

351
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,720
container and when i spray i spray the

352
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,040
[ __ ] out of the plant so i use the whole

353
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,040
leader i never uh over the course of a

354
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:03,838
feminized project i don't have any left

355
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:05,519
i'll use that entire leader so

356
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,680
i usually don't store it for very long i

357
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,440
don't know how long it can be stored for

358
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:10,879
me silver thiosulfate is super

359
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,560
affordable super cheap to make it

360
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:14,480
doesn't cost that much for 20 or 30

361
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:16,638
bucks you can make gallons of it so i

362
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,800
just make a fresh batch every time i'm

363
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,240
trying to make new feminized seeds i've

364
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:21,519
got a batch mixed up now because i'm

365
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,200
actually beginning to make some new

366
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:25,278
seeds that's a good segue right guys we

367
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,440
didn't talk about that i am starting to

368
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:29,919
make more feminized seeds a lot of

369
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,920
people are asking for uh the orange gasm

370
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:34,319
the golden goats the lemon jeffries and

371
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:36,078
a couple of other things they are in the

372
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,680
works you guys have started that so give

373
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:39,679
me a little bit of time don't rush me be

374
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:42,000
patient let me get it done correctly but

375
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:43,439
feminized seeds are coming i know you

376
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,879
want them i know they're in high demand

377
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,639
people have practically been begging for

378
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:48,320
the femme seeds it takes a lot of time

379
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,480
it takes a lot of space to make them i

380
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,480
did have other projects ahead of that

381
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,159
there was a learning curve learning to

382
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,800
adjust and breed in a whole room with

383
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:58,319
led lighting so um yeah give me some

384
00:12:56,799 --> 00:12:59,919
patience and we'll get those femme seats

385
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,920
coming up uh they're they're in the

386
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:03,679
works you guys all right so you can

387
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:05,199
store the silver thio sulfate in a cool

388
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:06,879
dry dark place

389
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,800
it's so cheap that i honestly just make

390
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:11,519
more of it and i really don't store a

391
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:13,359
lot of it because i use all of what i

392
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,799
make to reverse the plants that i'm

393
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,959
working with so i just make that one

394
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:18,958
liter uh use that you're going to use it

395
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:20,559
for the next 20. honestly i start

396
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:22,479
reversing a plant sometimes up to two

397
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:24,559
weeks before i'm gonna flip it so two

398
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,320
weeks before flower it gets a spray a

399
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:28,799
week before a flower it gets a spray the

400
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,879
day before flower it gets a spray then

401
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:32,719
every three days for 21 days it'll get a

402
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:33,519
spray so i'm going to spray it 10 times

403
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,680
ish

404
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,120
maybe a couple of more if if that plant

405
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:39,120
takes a long time if it's a longer

406
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,120
flowering sativa i'll spray it more

407
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,959
times even into flour just to remind it

408
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,720
hey [ __ ] don't go back to veg keep

409
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:47,039
making those flowering balls keep making

410
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,879
pollen for me i'm just reminding it just

411
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:50,078
giving it the the spray that it needs to

412
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:51,600
keep doing that

413
00:13:50,078 --> 00:13:53,759
encouraging it to keep producing pollen

414
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,120
for me so i spray it enough to where i

415
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:57,360
use all of it i don't ever have any

416
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,120
leftovers and then i just make more next

417
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,039
time because it's very cost effective if

418
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,399
you're doing it correctly it is very

419
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:04,000
very cost effective this is one of the

420
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,799
most affordable ingredients that we can

421
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,600
buy for the garden is making our own

422
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:11,278
silver biosulfate so i think i covered

423
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,519
most of that what's the best place to

424
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:15,759
store it and what's the shelf life i

425
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,679
honestly don't know the exact shelf life

426
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:18,879
because i've never uh it's never lasted

427
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:20,799
me that long it's like asking me the

428
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:23,120
shelf life life of cheesecake i don't

429
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:25,679
it's never lasted that long dude never

430
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,039
gotten to that point so um i don't know

431
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:28,799
i wish i could give you better info on

432
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:30,319
that but i really i would be lying and

433
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:32,479
making some [ __ ] up and that's not how i

434
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,320
do the show so uh big respect thank you

435
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,480
for the great question uh store it in

436
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,240
the fridge uh label it make sure

437
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,320
everybody in the household knows that

438
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,759
that stuff is not to drink with uh not

439
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,360
to drink not to make any food don't

440
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:45,439
consume that then i think everything

441
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,278
will go well for you and just make more

442
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,399
dude it's super affordable it's kind of

443
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:49,519
fun to make it and then you know you

444
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,120
have a fresh

445
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:53,120
potent batch every time you work with it

446
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,399
because it does lose quality over time

447
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,759
here's one thing to think about if it

448
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:57,440
changes colors

449
00:14:55,759 --> 00:15:00,000
it's going bad if it starts getting dark

450
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,760
if you start seeing stuff floating in it

451
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,679
if the lid of the jar starts turning

452
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:05,679
dark purple then it's probably time to

453
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:06,958
replace that you don't want to use that

454
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:08,638
product all right

455
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:10,638
thank you for the question bro i look

456
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,159
forward to some replies on this all

457
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,399
right i do have another question let's

458
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:15,759
see it says to read the one from cincy

459
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,320
so we're gonna grab this one right here

460
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:20,639
this one came from patreon this one came

461
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:23,199
from a person who i called cincy nasty

462
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:25,360
in the last episode and they have been

463
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:28,399
asked they've asked me to call them

464
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:30,000
cincy loco or cincy crazy so big shout

465
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,000
out to my buddy cynthia crazy they asked

466
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,078
why i called them cincynasty i'll

467
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,320
explain i'm a sneakerhead i recently

468
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:38,879
discovered some nike dunk sb lows that

469
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,879
said nasty boys on the back of them and

470
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:43,120
they are made for the cincinnati reds

471
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:44,399
team i don't care or know too much about

472
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,639
baseball no offense to baseball if

473
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,320
that's your thing go for it yay team i'm

474
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,919
very ignorant to sports and baseball but

475
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,519
i love these shoes and i read about them

476
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:53,679
to see why they said nasty boys on the

477
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,959
back there's a cincinnati reds team from

478
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:56,319
one year that there were three or four

479
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:58,000
players that just kicked ass and took

480
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,920
the team to the championship

481
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,679
uh go team go team but that's why the

482
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:04,319
shoes are called that so when i read the

483
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:06,000
word cincy i put nasty at the end of it

484
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,519
because they were the cincinnati reds

485
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,360
they were the nasty boys that's where

486
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,560
all that math came through in my head

487
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,039
hope i didn't offend you by calling you

488

who goes by cincynasty on instagram so i

490
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:18,719
think it was just embedded in my brain

491
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,839
big shout out to my buddy cincy nasty

492
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,759
hope you're well bro haven't heard from

493
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,600
you in a long time he posts a lot of

494
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,519
great graffiti pictures he does not do

495
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,720
the graffiti he posts the pictures you

496
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:28,879
guys don't go paint [ __ ] that's not

497
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,959
yours unless you're really talented

498
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:33,198
all right let's get focused read this

499
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:35,599
message from my buddy cincy loco or

500
00:16:33,198 --> 00:16:37,359
cinti crazy this one goes like this let

501
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,560
me kind of find the the meat because

502
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,839
there's a lot of stuff that's just for

503
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:41,518
me and not for you guys in this one it

504
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:43,519
says good evening great podcast this

505
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:45,120
week i thought you did an amazing job of

506
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:47,278
breaking down all the questions so

507
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,278
everyone can understand first of all

508
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:50,958
that is a huge compliment because i

509
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:52,240
understand that not everybody learns in

510
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:54,159
the same way

511
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,079
i'm kind of a hands-on learner i hated

512
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:57,919
school but i love to learn if that makes

513
00:16:56,078 --> 00:16:59,278
any sense if you're the kind of teacher

514
00:16:57,919 --> 00:17:01,360
that just sits there and reads from a

515
00:16:59,278 --> 00:17:03,519
book and expects me to follow along and

516
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,199
then learn something i'm bored about a

517
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:07,120
page in especially if you've got an

518
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,720
annoying voice i've already checked out

519
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:10,000
i'm thinking about other stuff what i'm

520
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,120
going to do when i get out of your dumb

521
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,880
ass class

522
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:14,639
if you're a fun entertaining teacher if

523
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,160
you can let me touch some things and

524
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,079
play with them and try to break stuff

525
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,000
and rebuild it then i'm gonna learn some

526
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:21,918
[ __ ] so i'm glad that you see that i try

527
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,279
to teach from a lot of different angles

528
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,640
that's why i kind of repeat myself

529
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:26,798
that's why some things i beat it into

530
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,799
the ground because still some people

531
00:17:26,798 --> 00:17:30,960
i'll i'll give i'll tell you a hundred

532
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:33,038
times that day one is when you flip the

533
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,519
plants 2 12 12 that's day one and i'll

534
00:17:33,038 --> 00:17:37,679
still get 24 emails asking when is day

535
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:40,400
one so i've got to say things a lot of

536
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:42,080
different ways um all right it's gonna

537
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,000
go on it says it has been really cool

538
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:45,199
i've got uh so he talks about a grow

539
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,679
that he's working on that we've talked

540
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,279
about then it says um

541
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:50,480
so he's doing a little bit of breeding

542
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:52,000
and he's talking about his breeding

543
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,839
project the main question is since these

544
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
plants are autos i'm wondering is it

545
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:58,319
better to have a taller plant with a lot

546
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,119
of bud separation so everything gets

547
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:03,599
light or is a smaller bushier plant

548
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:06,159
better for thc production so he's asking

549
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:08,319
about phenotypical expression of the

550
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:11,120
shape of the plant and wondering which

551
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:13,678
will give better thc production now

552
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:16,000
unfortunately i do not have an answer on

553
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:18,640
that those are plants uh i don't know

554
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,480
the traits of those plants um you could

555
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,799
probably grow a hundred seeds of the

556
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,440
crust that you made and you could find

557
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:27,599
25 squat plants and 25 tall plants and

558
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,519
you're going to find different ratios of

559
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:31,918
cannabinoids through those phenotypes

560
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:33,599
especially since you've created um it's

561
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:35,520
not real it's kind of an f1 it's kind of

562
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:37,038
a polyhybrid you're going to find a i

563
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:38,639
said polyhybrid excuse me for that

564
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:40,480
you're going to find a huge mix of

565
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:43,038
progeny in there

566
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,558
so i'm really not sure um taller plant

567
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:46,400
with a lot of bud separation so

568
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:47,839
everything gets light or a smaller

569
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,840
bushier plant

570
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:51,439
most people are going to prefer a

571
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:53,119
shorter bushier plant if you're making

572
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,400
seeds to share with people sell to

573
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:55,759
people they're going to want the shorter

574
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,000
bushier plants

575
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:59,599
most people are growing indoors a large

576
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,440
percent of the people growing indoors

577
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:02,719
are growing in a tent those people are

578
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:06,000
gonna want shorter plants it's just

579
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:08,000
gonna make sense for them um

580
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,519
sometimes they sacrifice that short

581
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,440
bushy faster flowering time for the thc

582
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:14,879
potency so they and i think they

583
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,038
understand that i think that they know

584
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,799
that that is part of the gamble uh in my

585
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:21,200
opinion i think that you get a better

586
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:22,480
potency from a photoperiod plant but i

587
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,640
don't have anything to back that up

588
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,599
that's just from from what i i've seen

589
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,799
and i don't really have any science

590
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:29,119
sorry i'm talking about my ass let's get

591
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:31,038
back to focus uh then it says does this

592
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:33,279
matter at all all of the autos will get

593
00:19:31,038 --> 00:19:35,119
you faded but not as heavily as the

594
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:36,480
regular photo period plants we have

595
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:38,479
grown so i think that statement backed

596
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,798
up what i was just trying to say uh this

597
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,640
person is growing autos and photos and

598
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:45,119
he says those autos get him faded but

599
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:47,280
not as much as the photoperiod plants uh

600
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:48,798
that does make sense the autos are kind

601
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:50,079
of in a hurry those photo periods they

602
00:19:48,798 --> 00:19:51,839
got all day they're just gonna build up

603
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:54,558
potency build up the hormones and the

604
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:56,079
precursors to make that potency um so i

605
00:19:54,558 --> 00:19:58,079
understand that now

606
00:19:56,079 --> 00:20:01,199
it says my goal has two parts with this

607
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:03,599
project goal one is to increase the thc

608
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,038
and have plants that yield well uh so i

609
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:07,038
guess that's number two is plants that

610
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:08,558
yield well that's always a good goal

611
00:20:07,038 --> 00:20:10,640
high potency high yields that's what

612
00:20:08,558 --> 00:20:12,079
everybody wants you get a good lab test

613
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,600
it looks good on the label looks good on

614
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:15,279
the jar people want to buy it and smoke

615
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:16,798
it and then if there's a lot of it you

616
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:18,960
can sell a lot of that [ __ ] and make

617
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:20,720
some money so that's always a good goal

618
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:24,079
it says which fino will help me reach

619
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:27,120
that goal more quickly the tall fino or

620
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:29,359
the short fino i really have no way to

621
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:31,519
predict that i honestly don't have a way

622
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:34,558
to predict that a couple of things you

623
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:36,798
could do you could take the taller pheno

624
00:20:34,558 --> 00:20:38,798
and the shorter pheno and get a lab test

625
00:20:36,798 --> 00:20:41,679
of them which one of them gives you a

626
00:20:38,798 --> 00:20:43,679
higher thc percentage then breed to that

627
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:44,640
one you've obviously got a higher thc

628
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,919
start

629
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,520
so you've got that ingredient that

630
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:49,600
you're looking for it's dominant you

631
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:52,079
know it's there use that one that is a

632
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:53,678
very good way to set yourself up for

633
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:56,639
success you know the ingredient you're

634
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:59,120
looking for is there um

635
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:01,360
so what i would do i would select a male

636
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:02,959
and i would pollinate both of them and i

637
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:04,798
know that sounds like a lot of work but

638
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,679
you just put the one male plant next to

639
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:10,000
your tall pheno next to your short fino

640
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:11,440
and you let them do their magic right

641
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,640
let them finish get the seeds out of

642
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,240
there the seeds are probably gonna take

643
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,000
six to eight weeks to finish cut the

644
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,839
both plants down label them tall and

645
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
skinny and short and squatty pull the

646
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:22,079
seeds out grow as many of the seeds as

647
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,720
you can from both of them

648
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:28,240
grow those seeds under scientifically

649
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:31,200
controlled conditions grow 50 or 100

650
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,960
tall and lanky seeds and grow 50 to 100

651
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,960
short and squatty seeds right next to

652
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,880
each other feed them exactly the same

653
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,038
give them the same environment make it

654
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:41,120
scientific acts like you got two little

655
00:21:39,038 --> 00:21:42,960
kids in the room and if you give one one

656
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:44,959
extra [ __ ] cheez-it they're gonna

657
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,558
throw a fit act like you got little kids

658
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,120
in the room and feed them and treat them

659
00:21:46,558 --> 00:21:51,119
all exactly the same and then see which

660
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:53,519
do you like better maybe you're gonna

661
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:54,879
find out that that thc isn't exactly

662
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:57,038
what you're looking for maybe one of

663
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,640
them has a terp that really [ __ ] you up

664
00:21:57,038 --> 00:22:00,558
and gets you right where you need to be

665
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,000
it's not always about the thc that's

666
00:22:00,558 --> 00:22:04,399
something really important to keep in

667
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,640
mind you may find a terpene you may find

668
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,480
a cannabinoid combination you may find a

669
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,880
few things that mix together in one of

670
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,640
those phenotypes that really blast you

671
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,480
just the way you need to get blasted

672
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,919
sometimes that's like what the breeders

673
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,519
discover for ourselves we have the

674
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:19,360
opportunity to breed and grow so many

675
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:21,279
seeds we find something unique to

676
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:22,959
ourselves then we discover that when we

677
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:25,200
share it it's unique to a lot of people

678
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:28,319
and they enjoy it as well so don't focus

679
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:30,400
too much on finding thc focus on finding

680
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:32,798
a very balanced plan a plant that grows

681
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,480
well a plant that produces well and then

682
00:22:32,798 --> 00:22:36,720
it's got some terps what's the point of

683
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,159
having a plant that grows a lot of buds

684
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,839
and gets you really high if when you

685
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:41,280
smoke it it tastes like you're smoking

686
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:42,879
burnt pubes nobody's going to want to

687
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:44,558
smoke that it's not enjoyable no matter

688
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,480
how high it gets me probably not going

689
00:22:44,558 --> 00:22:47,839
to smoke your buds it's smelling tastes

690
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,000
like burnt pubes it's got to have some

691
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:52,319
good terps to it some good aromas good

692
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
flavors good bag of peel good colors

693
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:55,439
it's got to be sticky there are a lot of

694
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,720
other things to think about that go

695
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:00,558
along with that thc so i understand the

696
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,600
desire for thc and high yield that's

697
00:23:00,558 --> 00:23:03,440
what we want you want to get high and

698
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:05,359
you want a lot of it right but you got

699
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,200
to get some other things in there

700
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:09,279
let me get myself back on track what i

701
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,200
would do i would breed to both of those

702
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:12,960
i would take both your plants pollinate

703
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,038
them you've got seeds of both grow them

704
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:17,679
both see what you like here is something

705
00:23:15,038 --> 00:23:20,079
that you can do early on to help you

706
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:22,720
decide how to move forward have you ever

707
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:25,119
thought about predicative testing we can

708
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:27,120
plant as many a population of seeds from

709
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:29,119
both so you got shortened squat cross to

710
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:30,959
your male uh you got tall and skinny

711
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:33,119
cross to your mail you got those seeds

712
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:35,919
growing you can get little test kits

713
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:37,519
that you can you basically open up fold

714
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:39,200
unfold a matchbook and you rub part of

715
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:40,879
the leaf tissue on the matchbook and you

716
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,120
close it back up and then you put a

717
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:45,200
number on it shorten squat plant number

718
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:46,879
two shorten squat plant number three and

719
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,720
continue label each one according to

720
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:51,120
what plant number you've got you send

721
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:53,440
those tests off to a laboratory they can

722
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:55,439
tell you if that plant is a male or a

723
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,720
female which is a great thing to have we

724
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,000
already can eliminate the plants we

725
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,640
don't need if we're looking for males

726
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,440
and females they can also detect the

727
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:05,278
presence of cannabinoid precursors which

728
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,120
means they can tell you if those plants

729
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:11,919
later on in their life will develop high

730
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:13,678
thc high cbd high thcv they can dictate

731
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:15,520
and pred and predict all of the

732
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:17,519
cannabinoids that may be present in that

733
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:19,519
plant they are in very very low

734
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:22,000
concentrations and low ratios at this

735
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:24,558
time but they know that if the presence

736
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,079
of this cannabinoid and this other i'm

737
00:24:24,558 --> 00:24:28,319
not sure the detectors and the markers

738
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:31,038
on the test but they can say this plant

739
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:32,639
has potential for being a high thc

740
00:24:31,038 --> 00:24:34,640
potency plant they can tell you that

741
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,400
when the plants are three four five or

742
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:39,360
six inches tall so you don't have to

743
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:41,600
waste a lot of time so if your main goal

744
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:42,719
is for potency you can send in a lab

745
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:44,959
test

746
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,720
and this is this is kind of new science

747
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,960
backwards breeding

748
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:51,200
be open-minded to this this is a new way

749
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:53,759
and a backwards way of doing it you can

750
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:56,640
send in a lab test then they will send

751
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:58,798
you back the numbers find the outliers

752
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:01,200
within those populations so if you're

753
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:05,038
looking for high thc and you've got 50

754
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:06,960
plants find the top 10 thc plants in

755
00:25:05,038 --> 00:25:09,278
those tests and get rid of get rid of

756
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:12,720
the other 40. so you've got your 10

757
00:25:09,278 --> 00:25:14,319
highest thc potency females left from

758
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,400
each side now you just went from 100

759
00:25:14,319 --> 00:25:18,798
plants down to 20 and we know that these

760
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:21,919
are all going to be high thc highly

761
00:25:18,798 --> 00:25:23,918
potent plants now we grow them we flour

762
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:26,000
them out we finish them and now we look

763
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:28,880
for all of the other traits which we may

764
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,798
desire to make those plants what we want

765
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,720
for the market for ourselves we already

766
00:25:30,798 --> 00:25:34,319
know they're going to have high thc now

767
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,159
we find the one with the terps now we

768
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:37,678
find the one that doesn't get powdery

769
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:40,159
mildew now we find the one that grows

770
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:41,679
the way we want it to grow does it grow

771
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:43,200
tall and skinny does it grow short and

772
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:45,120
squat you find the one that works for

773
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,720
you is there one that tastes amazing do

774
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:48,479
a couple of them taste like burnt pubes

775
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,319
like we talked about earlier now you

776
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,000
already know that what you've got is all

777
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:53,599
high potency plants they're going to

778
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,599
have the potency you're looking for now

779
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:58,000
we just got to find the other markers in

780
00:25:55,599 --> 00:26:00,319
that population so that's another option

781
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,640
is predicative testing to remove the

782
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:05,119
outliers or include the outliers from a

783
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,880
population then select from those that

784
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:08,959
will definitely minimize population

785
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:11,120
quite quickly but if you don't have

786
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:13,919
access and funding for that type of lab

787
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:15,918
what you would do is grow them dude grow

788
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:18,240
them out just like any other pheno hunt

789
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:20,159
and smoke them smoke them yourself smoke

790
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,079
them with your friends and see what

791
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:23,919
turns heads and what gets attention you

792
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:25,678
will know some stuff will definitely

793
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:28,159
turn some heads some stuff will get

794
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:30,080
ignored it may be completely different

795
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:31,600
for you and your crew i said earlier

796
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:33,439
maybe sometimes you'll create some [ __ ]

797
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:34,879
that everybody goes dude what is that

798
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,640
like i've been at concerts before and

799
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,240
lit up a joint and i've had everybody

800
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,400
for 50 feet turn and look at me like

801
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:42,000
what the [ __ ] are you smoking they've

802
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,759
all wanted to buy seeds or buy an eighth

803
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,599
off me and they all circled around like

804
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:47,278
vultures that's how you know you hit

805
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:48,480
gold sometimes you light up some weed

806
00:26:47,278 --> 00:26:50,079
and you try to pass it to your friends

807
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,919
and they go

808
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:53,759
i'm good that smells like you're smoking

809
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:55,360
your fingernails over there

810
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:56,798
sometimes you smoke some [ __ ] that

811
00:26:55,359 --> 00:26:57,918
you're like i'm not super fond of this

812
00:26:56,798 --> 00:26:59,599
and you smoke it with one of your

813
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:01,120
friends and they're like dude i've got

814
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:02,558
this medical problem that i've had my

815
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:04,239
whole life and when i smoke that [ __ ] i

816
00:27:02,558 --> 00:27:06,000
feel amazing and you're like when i

817
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,079
smoked it i didn't notice anything there

818
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,519
might be a terp a cannabinoid a compound

819
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:11,278
in there that works beautifully for

820
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:12,558
something they've got going on that's

821
00:27:11,278 --> 00:27:14,400
always beautiful to find because then

822
00:27:12,558 --> 00:27:15,678
you give them a clone of that plant or

823
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,120
you give them seeds or whatever you're

824
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:18,880
like here you go buddy that's your magic

825
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:20,079
medicine now that feels good that you've

826
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,440
helped out a friend for the rest of

827
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:23,278
their [ __ ] life they found relief

828
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,960
from something that bugged them for a

829
00:27:23,278 --> 00:27:26,558
long time you didn't even know you made

830
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,399
their medicine i've had that happen

831
00:27:26,558 --> 00:27:31,359
before big up to those people they know

832
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:33,839
who they are but the real answer here uh

833
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:35,918
the only real way to know this is to

834
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:37,839
grow out these seeds i would cross the

835
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:40,080
mail to the shortened squat i would

836
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:42,240
cross the mail the selected mail one

837
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:44,879
male pick one dude that you really like

838
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:47,278
pick one dude and pollinate all of the

839
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,039
plants the squatty and the tall one

840
00:27:47,278 --> 00:27:51,359
pollinate both of those with the same

841
00:27:49,038 --> 00:27:53,278
dude get those seeds clearly label them

842
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:55,519
and grow them both under the same

843
00:27:53,278 --> 00:27:57,119
conditions and see how you like that

844
00:27:55,519 --> 00:27:59,440
that's the only way to find out is to

845
00:27:57,119 --> 00:28:01,038
run the plants run the mix and see what

846
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,960
you made otherwise you're just kind of

847
00:28:01,038 --> 00:28:04,720
guessing i have no way of telling you

848
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,240
like which is going to have higher thc

849
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,798
by looking at these plants i would have

850
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,880
to smoke it maybe run it through a lab i

851
00:28:08,798 --> 00:28:11,759
don't have that ability and keep in mind

852
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,200
again

853
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:15,278
i know i've said this but i just want to

854
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:18,399
stress this part because this we all get

855
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:20,398
consumed by uh lab reports and lab

856
00:28:18,398 --> 00:28:22,639
numbers and terpene reports and test

857
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:23,839
results and all that [ __ ] but here's

858
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,600
something that i said the other day in a

859
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:27,839
live chat and all the growers in there

860
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:29,678
laughed pretty hard i've never had a

861
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:31,678
liquid chromatography machine come back

862
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:34,080
and try to buy another bag

863
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:35,440
no matter how high the lab report was

864
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:37,119
none of those machines have ever called

865
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:39,278
me and hit me up for another eighth does

866
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:40,959
that make any sense to you people buy

867
00:28:39,278 --> 00:28:43,119
weed we're not growing machine we're not

868
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:45,440
growing weed for machines people smoke

869
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:47,918
weed people smoke dabs not high pressure

870
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,360
liquid chromatography machines uh we can

871
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:50,880
impress those machines very easily i

872
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:52,319
know how to manipulate a lab test we can

873
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,240
get high [ __ ] numbers if we really

874
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:55,519
really wanted to push it we could really

875
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,640
push it to where people are showing up

876
00:28:55,519 --> 00:28:58,319
at the grow going what the [ __ ] are you

877
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,759
guys doing we can get cnn there it

878
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:02,639
wouldn't be hard to manipulate a lab

879
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:05,038
test uh but what's the point like the

880
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,480
numbers are just like if you smoke it

881
00:29:05,038 --> 00:29:09,200
and it doesn't get you where you want to

882
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:11,200
be it could say 100 thc on the label and

883
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,798
it doesn't matter to me it's got to have

884
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,319
some terps it's got to have a few other

885
00:29:12,798 --> 00:29:16,879
things to get my attention it's got to

886
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:19,119
be tasty i can smoke all the wheat i

887
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,640
want i live in colorado there's all the

888
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:21,759
weed like i can go to the store and i

889
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,440
could buy

890
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:25,200
two ounces today and two ounces tomorrow

891
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:27,519
and if i can smoke two ounces by myself

892
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:29,519
in a day i gotta get better weed but my

893
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:30,960
point is i can smoke all the weed we can

894
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:32,558
get dabs we can get edibles we can get

895
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,840
as [ __ ] up as we want i need it to

896
00:29:32,558 --> 00:29:35,519
taste good that's one of the most

897
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:37,759
important parts to me i don't want to

898
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:40,000
smoke bad tasting herb herb that burns

899
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:42,000
my throat or herb that makes my tongue

900
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,759
feel weird i'm not into it why smoke

901
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,679
that [ __ ] when there's good [ __ ] so my

902
00:29:43,759 --> 00:29:46,960
point is i don't focus too much on the

903
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:48,640
numbers because the machines aren't

904
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,919
gonna come by another eighth the people

905
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,440
are gonna come by another eighth and

906
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:53,440
they're the ones that are gonna say damn

907
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:55,120
that smells skunky dan that was super

908
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,798
sticky damn that tastes like bubble gum

909
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:58,158
and popsicles they're the ones that are

910
00:29:56,798 --> 00:29:59,839
gonna come back with some money not the

911
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:02,320
machine so don't focus too much on those

912
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:04,000
numbers that's my main point here

913
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:05,119
let me get my high ass back on track

914
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,440
obviously i've been smoking something

915
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:08,798
[ __ ] good today uh cincy loco thank

916
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:11,600
you for the great message dude i think i

917
00:30:08,798 --> 00:30:13,918
answered this honestly um which one will

918
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:15,839
help me get to that goal quicker um i

919
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:17,520
shouldn't harp too much on that part but

920
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:19,678
when you're breeding don't focus on

921
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:22,398
getting to the goal more quickly focus

922
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:24,240
on getting the goal accurately there's

923
00:30:22,398 --> 00:30:25,519
no fast tracking and breeding doing it

924
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,880
the fast way

925
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:28,798
will get you [ __ ] up that's the way to

926
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,080
[ __ ] it all up do it the quick way so uh

927
00:30:28,798 --> 00:30:32,000
grow from your heart breathe with love

928
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:34,000
and take your time man put some love and

929
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,558

930
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
some passion and do it correctly um

931
00:30:36,558 --> 00:30:39,359
it's only gonna you're gonna do two

932
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,200
plants side by side it's not gonna take

933
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:43,038
you much longer the hard part will be

934
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,319
growing both of them but it's fun then

935
00:30:43,038 --> 00:30:45,519
you get to compare you get to take a

936
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:47,439
bunch of notes which we're gonna talk

937
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:50,240
about in a future episode all right it

938
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:51,919
goes on to say i'd prefer uh let's see

939
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,120
since iloco or cincy nasty would be

940
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:54,640
preferred

941
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:55,918
then he asked what gave me the nasty

942
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,120
vibe

943
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:58,720
nothing to do with any of the things

944
00:30:57,119 --> 00:31:00,879
that you listed i think i explained that

945
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:03,038
a moment ago it all stemmed from a pair

946
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:05,760
of shoes from the cincinnati reds

947
00:31:03,038 --> 00:31:07,440
triggered my brain got the add going
