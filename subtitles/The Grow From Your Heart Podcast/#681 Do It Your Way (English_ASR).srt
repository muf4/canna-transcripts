are having trouble coming out today but

72
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:47,439
also it is a super windy day here in

73
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,200
southern colorado we are having extreme

74
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:51,280
winds if you hear weird noises in the

75
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:52,719
background i try to take out most of the

76
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,318
noise with this

77
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:56,400
processing gear here i will try to do

78
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:58,639
some more corrections in the computer

79
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,840
when i edit but you may hear some crazy

80
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:01,199
noises coming through my air

81
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,200
conditioning vents

82
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:05,518
there was debris and stuff bashing

83
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:08,799
against the house if you hear noises i

84
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:11,439
do apologize speaking of crazy wind

85
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,040
tonight is the first cold night in

86
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:15,680
colorado i've been complaining that it

87
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:17,519
is getting cold tonight it is officially

88
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,360
cold i think i was just kidding before

89
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,439
when i was saying it was cold tonight

90
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,640
mother nature is serious it's cold as

91
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:26,239
[ __ ] outside if you had plants outside

92
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:28,399
they were not in a greenhouse or some

93
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:31,360
sort of protected environment tonight

94
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,439
was the last night or today was the last

95
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,360
day to cut them down most of your plants

96
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:37,039
are going to start experiencing problems

97
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,280
they're going to get too cold of course

98
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:41,519
last year we saw some amazing [ __ ] but

99
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,439
ideally plants would be down by now if

100
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,640
you've got an outdoor environment if

101
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:46,560
you've got a greenhouse with some

102
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:48,238
heaters or some tricks you may be able

103
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,640
to keep those plants going but tonight

104
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,799
it is super cold everybody in southern

105
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:55,119

106
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,120

107

114
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,438

116
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:19,279
of the plants are gone they're down

117

118
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:22,559

those i definitely will keep you updated

139
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:06,478
but if you don't have some winter gear

140
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:08,240
going on in your grow you might want to

141
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:10,399
consider getting all your plants down if

142
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,319
you have not already because it is

143
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:14,159
frosty cold here in colorado i had to

144
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:16,000
fire up the heater uh there's a heater

145
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,280
here on this recording space going feels

146
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,959
kind of nice you could probably hear

147
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:21,038
that thing making noise too got a long

148
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:23,439
sleeve hoodie on it's for real cold

149
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:25,120
today nature's not [ __ ] around now i

150
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:27,519
did mention that i had some friends and

151
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,280
a crew working a greenhouse that kind of

152
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:31,038
leads me into one of the topics i want

153
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:31,839
to talk about on this episode of the

154
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:34,000
show

155
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:36,638
the reason that greenhouse worked is

156
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,639
because i let those growers do their

157
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,478
thing these people had a greenhouse that

158
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,879
was already set up they've been running

159
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:44,319
the greenhouse for years we spoke i said

160
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:45,839
hey i want to make some seeds in your

161
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:47,759
greenhouse they said that sounds like a

162
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:49,839
really good idea we were came to a

163
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,840
beautiful agreement uh they did a bunch

164
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:53,519
of work on the plants i gave some great

165
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:55,599
guidance did some hands-on work showed

166
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:57,680
them some things some tricks some tips

167
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,000
gave them a good strategy but for the

168
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,160
most part i honestly stayed out of the

169
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,959
way and let them grow it's their

170
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,120
greenhouse they know the flow they know

171
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:09,038
uh who is good at what who likes to do

172
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,038
what they've got their systems and their

173
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:12,639
ideas and their sops in place they were

174
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:14,399
doing a different design a different

175
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,840
grow because they usually of course

176
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:17,679
don't produce seeds in their product

177
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:19,599
they usually have a scentsy bud a

178
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,280
seedless bud but this year they were

179
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,080
making seeds for me so there were some

180
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:26,959
changes to be made but with very minimal

181
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:28,959
guidance my crew my team my friends were

182
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:31,599
able to produce high quality seeds

183
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:33,359
mainly i think because i stayed out of

184
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,439
the way and let them work with their

185
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,759
style and their flow

186
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:40,240
i could have gone in and i did of course

187
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:42,080
i took notes uh on things that i didn't

188
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,439
like and i made suggestions and we made

189
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:45,038
corrections as we went it was all

190
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:46,240
friendly it was like hey i see that

191
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:47,439
you're doing this

192
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,840
what's your reason and they would give

193
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:51,360
me a reason i would say cool reason i

194
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:52,879
understand but i've been doing it for a

195
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,560
long time and this is what that is going

196
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:56,560
to cause i saw one thing they're trying

197
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,319
to do to prevent one problem but it was

198
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,759
going to cause two more problems we had

199
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,080
a quick team meeting and we quickly

200
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,840
agreed let's not do this i'd rather have

201
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:06,079
small problem a than compounding

202
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:07,918
problems b and c so there were a couple

203
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:10,318
of quick meetings a couple of

204
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:11,680
observations i took notes i thought of

205
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,439
things that we can improve next year

206
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,120
we've already talked about that but

207
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:17,279
honestly i stayed out of their way and

208
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,959
just let them do their thing because

209
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:20,959
they are experienced cannabis growers

210
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:23,519
they have developed their system they've

211
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:25,198
developed their sops also that's their

212
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:26,959
greenhouse they know

213
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,478
they knew what weather to expect they

214
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:30,560
knew where the hot pockets in the grow

215
00:07:28,478 --> 00:07:32,318
was not the hot pockets we eat you guys

216
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,360
the warm spots in the grow some people

217
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,000
right now are getting the munchies

218
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,598
because i said that uh but uh free

219
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,279
advertising there you go eat something

220
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:40,959
better for you but they knew all the

221
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:42,239
problems and the niches of the grow they

222
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:43,839
knew where all the switches all the

223
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,439
bells all the whistles if we wanted to

224
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:46,638
turn on something they knew where that

225
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:48,240
button was

226
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,759
so it's their place

227
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,918
what i'm getting at

228
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:54,160
is i see a lot of people on social media

229
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:57,038
trying to give people instructions and

230
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:59,840
they say you need to do this or you must

231
00:07:57,038 --> 00:08:02,478
do this and they give crazy crazy advice

232
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:04,719
what i want to say is do things your way

233
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:07,360
and it will work there are a few rules

234
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,759
of growing cannabis basically uh keep

235
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,680
them alive water them give them proper

236
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,840
light and then if you have a successful

237
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,000
harvest that you were happy with you did

238
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:17,758
it right if the plants don't die you're

239
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,120
doing it correctly you can do things

240
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:23,439
better you can do things differently but

241
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,918
if you have a harvested outcome you did

242
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:28,000
it right if you were satisfied with it

243
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:30,079
what we can always do is work on

244
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,479
improving what we have done the first

245
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:35,120
time the second time the third time your

246
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,719
first grow allow your first grow to be a

247
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,479
total train wreck that way you've got

248
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,479
some learning and some experience from

249
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,240
it if that first grow comes off

250
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,680
perfectly you're never going to learn

251
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,360
anything your ego is going to get big

252
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,879
you're going to go i can grow we let's

253
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,360
just do it and your next grow is going

254
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:51,360
to suck because you got egotistical and

255
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:54,240
you didn't have any mistakes if you have

256
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,759
some adversity you learn a lot more so

257
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,759
let me get back on my notes because i do

258
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:59,200
have some sort of direction here what

259
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:01,439
i'm what i'm trying to get to is do

260
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,040
things your way you're learning from me

261
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,519
you're probably learning from books

262
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:07,838
other podcasters maybe your friends

263
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:10,720
listen to all of us take all of our

264
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:12,320
information then turn it into your thing

265
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,600
you're hearing a lot of different things

266
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,399
a lot of getting a lot of different

267
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,560
input kind of translate that interpret

268
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:21,600
it how you would like and make it your

269
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:23,759
grow that grow space is yours design it

270
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,159
the way you want grow the plants you

271
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:28,159
want grow the style you want

272
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:29,759
these plants do require some love and

273
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:32,240
some care and some attention for a

274
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:34,879
top-notch harvest but don't expect your

275
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,399
first harvest to be amazing you haven't

276
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:38,958
developed your skill yet you haven't

277
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:41,278
developed your style yet and also don't

278
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:43,439
expect that growth to be exactly like

279
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:45,278
mine it doesn't have to be my grow do

280
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,720
your growth the way you want develop

281
00:09:45,278 --> 00:09:49,120
your style

282
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:52,000
develop your skill set then it will all

283
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:54,560
come together learn make some mistakes

284
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,720
kill some plants over water some things

285
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:59,039
over feed some things under feed some

286
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,040
things get all the way to the harvest

287
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:02,879
and then mess up the dry and cure

288
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:04,799
experience all of the pitfalls and

289
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:06,480
mistakes that a grower can make i've

290
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:08,399
done a full episode about making

291
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,639
mistakes because i've made plenty of

292
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,320
them that's why i'm a good grower i

293
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:13,919
think that if i had never made any

294
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,640
mistakes i've said it before i wouldn't

295
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:18,319
be as good of a grower as i think i am

296
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:20,559
now i can problem solve now i can

297
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,800
correct issues on the fly now i can

298
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:24,399
anticipate and predict problems like i

299
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:26,078
said a moment ago we were going to

300
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,399
correct problem a but i knew it would

301
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:30,799
make problem b and c happen so we just

302
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,639
stick with problem a and try to mitigate

303
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:35,120
that as much as possible

304
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:37,360
i can anticipate and predict the issues

305
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:40,000
that will arise in the grow room from

306
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,600
experience if you stick with your craft

307
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,919
and pay attention and fall in love with

308
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,079
this craft and do it with passion and

309
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:48,000
take notes and dedication is the word

310
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:50,239
i'm looking for you will develop the

311
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,639
skills the same skill set that i've got

312
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:55,039
i'm nobody special i'm just some dude

313
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:57,278
just like you or you're maybe some lady

314
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:59,838
some female or maybe whatever spectrum

315
00:10:57,278 --> 00:11:01,360
you find yourself in i'm just a person

316
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:02,720
and i've done a lot of research and i'm

317
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,519
passionate about my craft there's

318
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,440
nothing stopping you from becoming this

319
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,679
knowledgeable and skillful with this

320
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,680
plant in a grow you can achieve this

321
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:13,120
just learn pay attention you might not

322
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:14,799
be growing yet you may be

323
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,560
semi-experienced you may be a better

324
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:18,078
grower than me but there's always

325
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:20,479
something to learn and your style is

326
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:22,639
always developing so don't think that

327
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,320
your first grow has to be the best don't

328
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:25,919
think that that's your last growth

329
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,920
that's your first grow that's the one

330
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:29,439
you should make mistakes on if you make

331
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:30,479
mistakes on like the ninth and tenth

332
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,160
grow that's when we go hey is this

333
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,519
person ever going to learn are they just

334
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:35,600
going to keep driving into the [ __ ]

335
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,839
wall make some mistakes on that first

336
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,320
second and third grow so that you know

337
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,480
like oops i overfed i saw crispy leaves

338

water one day and i got droopy ass

340
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:48,399
plants i over watered the next day i got

341
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,399
clawed and [ __ ] up plants then start

342
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:53,120
learning to identify signs of heat

343
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,639
stress cold stress other stresses start

344
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,240
then you'll start seeing bugs you won't

345
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:58,000
go what are these spots on my plants and

346
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,278
you wait two weeks to treat for spider

347
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,120
mites because you didn't even know they

348
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:03,200
were mites just develop that

349
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,440
relationship get in there play with the

350
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,920
plants learn some skills kill some [ __ ]

351
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,399
that's where i was make some mistakes

352
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:11,838
i've made crucial mistakes in big and

353
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,679
small grows

354
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:15,519
let's make all of these mistakes early

355
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:17,919
on so that we can get them out of the

356
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:19,759
way get them under our belt learn from

357
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:21,599
them get a little embarrassment get a

358
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:23,519
little humbling from it and then have

359
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,000
that lesson in your tool belt to move

360
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:29,278
forward with in the future to prevent us

361
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,440
from making that mistake again also that

362
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:33,039
may help you predict and anticipate

363
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,560
other mistakes that you may make you may

364
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:36,480
be like hey i did something similar to

365
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:37,919
this that one time let me read my notes

366
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,519
and then i'll have a big circle with an

367
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:40,799
x on it like don't ever do this dumb

368
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,360
[ __ ] again because it made all the

369
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:45,278
plants go crazy like take some notes and

370
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,800
learn a lot about what you're doing let

371
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:48,879
me get on my notes because i'm rambling

372
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:50,838
in stone today uh this should be

373
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:52,958
enjoyable and

374
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:54,639
educational when i see people telling

375
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:57,039
people that they have to do some [ __ ] or

376
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,320
that they must do this or just random

377
00:12:57,039 --> 00:12:59,679
instructions i'm like you're just

378
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,680
sucking the enjoyment out of the plants

379
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:04,159
let this person grow the way that they

380
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:06,319
want to grow and develop their style and

381
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:07,759
their system and their flow of growing

382
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,160
you'll become a good grower you'll have

383
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:11,919
your own system your style every grower

384
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:13,838
walks into the grow and we've got like a

385
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:16,078
routine you do this and then you do this

386
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:17,760
this is how i mix this is how i feed

387
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:19,679
this is how i do this this is what i

388
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:21,919
check on these are the notes i take this

389
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:23,599
is my clean up procedure clock out go

390
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:25,759
home everyone's got their little system

391
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,040
you will develop yours that will work

392
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:29,039
for you

393
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:30,799
your system doesn't have to be like my

394
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:32,559
system it doesn't have to be like the

395
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:34,240
dude system it doesn't have to be scotty

396
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:36,078
real system it doesn't have to be guru

397
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,079
system it doesn't have to be anybody

398
00:13:36,078 --> 00:13:39,599
from any other podcast system or any

399
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:42,719
other professional grower you've ever

400
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:45,120
seen it can be your system make it a

401
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,040
hybrid of all of the systems that you've

402
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,879
seen i always recommend starting off

403
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:50,879
simple and expanding there but start

404
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:52,399
with the system that gets your attention

405
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:54,240
something will get your attention when

406
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:56,240
it comes to growing a strain that you

407
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,079
want to grow will get your attention a

408
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,519
system will get your attention a light

409
00:13:58,078 --> 00:14:01,759
will get your attention when you do a

410
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,839
little research delve into it all of the

411
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:06,000
things will come together your setup

412
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:08,399
your style and your system will kind of

413
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,639
develop itself and it will be a

414
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,958
beautiful enjoyable experience it'll be

415
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:14,799
your comfort zone once you get that grow

416
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:16,799
dialed in it will be where you retreat

417
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:18,399
to get away from all of the crap in your

418
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:20,000
life you'll be like ah something's

419
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,600
stressful i'm going to the grow and

420
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,198
you'll just go hang out in there and it

421
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,120
will feel good you'll forget about all

422
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:26,559
the other [ __ ] that's going on in life

423
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,320
sometimes i say i'm going to go in the

424
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:30,239
grow and just hang out for like 30

425
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,680
minutes maybe pull some leaves see if i

426
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,278
can find anything that i can do just

427
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:34,638
look for work in there

428
00:14:33,278 --> 00:14:36,879
and then i realize oh yeah i've just

429
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:38,480
listened to like seven seven podcasts in

430
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:40,159
here and i haven't really done anything

431
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,079
i'm just like pulling leaves and popping

432
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:43,919
stems and just just finding light work

433
00:14:42,078 --> 00:14:45,759
to do but time will just go by and there

434
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:47,519

435
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:50,000
good the temperature is perfect the

436
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:52,000

comforting and relaxing and enjoyable

441
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,720
don't make it stressful because people

442
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,320
on the internet say you have to top that

443
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,240

opinion don't let it bother you do your

446
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,278
thing just do it your way of course if

the plants are dying and if [ __ ] is

448

00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:58,240
on my notes sometimes you will have to

468
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:00,880
adjust and adapt your space and your

469
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,320
schedule and your budget and your style

470
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:05,198
and your goal

471
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:07,440
um just adjust sometimes the things you

472
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:08,879
tried to do might not work out after

473
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,720
that first or second grow if you're

474
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:13,360
seeing that something isn't working

475
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,519
adjust and adapt don't be stubborn i've

476
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:17,440
seen people try to make [ __ ] work if it

477
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,360
doesn't work it just doesn't work let's

478
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,360
adapt adjust and correct things and set

479
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,399
ourselves up for success instead of

480
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:26,720
spending money

481
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:28,879
on lights soil uh water nutrients maybe

482
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,320
you wasted seeds maybe you wasted clones

483
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:32,879
let's quit wasting things i do have

484
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,399
another episode uh planned and prepared

485
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:35,759
to talk about how to save some money and

486
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:37,759
budget better in the growth so we'll

487
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:39,680
talk about that in the future

488
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:41,278
but uh people make growing really

489
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:43,919
stressful and i see the internet trying

490
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:45,519
to make growing stressful on new growers

491
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:47,360
trying to prevent that let's keep it fun

492
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:49,519
you guys let's just keep it a good time

493
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:52,879
it should be therapeutic relaxing should

494
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:55,278
be the zen zone um i can make a big grow

495
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:58,320
fun and enjoyable we run large grows

496
00:16:55,278 --> 00:17:00,078
with multiple 100 lights 500 lights and

497
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,920
20 people working and we're having a

498
00:17:00,078 --> 00:17:03,679
good time we got the music up super loud

499
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:05,918
we're high fiving each other

500
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:07,759
when we get a row of clones done we all

501
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:09,679
do the ric flair woo because we're all

502
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:11,838
excited about it

503
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:13,759
i try to make a big environment exciting

504
00:17:11,838 --> 00:17:16,078
and all that takes is just building a

505
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:17,759
flow building a system having a team

506
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:19,918
that communicates and all knows what the

507
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:21,679
final goal is and then just having a

508
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:24,160
good attitude and setting yourself up

509
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:26,880
for success every day today you're

510
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,400
setting yourself up for success tomorrow

511
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,480
that's not just in the grow that's

512
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,720
everywhere but in the grow you can see

513
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,880
it if you don't do the side work tonight

514
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,640
before you leave tomorrow you've got to

515
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,880
do the side work before you can even

516
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,640
start doing the real work so you're just

517
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,640
rushing to get to the real work then you

518
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,000
got to do the real work in a rush then

519
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,440
you don't get the side work done again

520
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,440
tonight because you [ __ ] up and had to

521
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,759
rush everything then there's always a

522
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,840
surprise in a commercial grow always a

523

525
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,038
commercial grow i just have them shadow

526
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:58,639
me for a day and as we walk in i always

527
00:17:57,038 --> 00:18:00,798
say the first thing we're gonna do is

528
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,880

pump broke what light went out there's a

530
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:07,120
lot of moving parts in a 500 light grow

531
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:08,558
a lot of things can break let's go find

532

can feel your vibes do you ever walk

540
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:26,798
into a grow and you just feel that life

541
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:29,440
force that presence that energy that is

542
00:18:26,798 --> 00:18:32,079
the plants why can't the plants feel it

543
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:35,200
from us as well uh if you're walking in

544
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:37,199
there anxious disheveled nervous rushed

545
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,960
the plants feel that what if you went to

546
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,480
the doctor or the dentist and the

547
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,279
dentist had like

548
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:45,279

got time to like sit down and look at my

555
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:57,359

560
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,679
the plants enjoy that too and they can

561
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:06,960
feel it from you

562
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:08,320
all right i'm gonna catch up on these

563
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,759
notes i'm stoned and rambling i want to

564
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:10,720
make sure i got all the important parts

565
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:13,200
here

566
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,798
make it enjoyable and educational those

567
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,519
are the words that i have in bold

568
00:19:14,798 --> 00:19:19,279
there's no exact way to grow cannabis

569
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:20,879
the exact way is the way that's working

570
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:22,720
for you i've seen it done a billion

571
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,640
different ways and guess what i've seen

572
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,798
a billion successful outcomes so

573
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,400
whatever is working for you do that [ __ ]

574
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:30,079
don't let anyone on the internet scare

575
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,480
you don't let them tell you you're doing

576
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:34,319
it wrong don't let them talk [ __ ] to you

577
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,558
uh let them give you constructive

578
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:38,399
criticism and then learn how to filter

579
00:19:36,558 --> 00:19:39,759
out all the [ __ ] the internet is

580
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:43,360
full of crap and you're gonna get some

581
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:45,200
terrible terrible advice always ask why

582
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:47,119
when you when somebody gives you advice

583
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,038
just say why and see if they can tell

584
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:51,038
you why if they say because my uncle

585
00:19:49,038 --> 00:19:53,279
larry did it in the 70s and it worked

586
00:19:51,038 --> 00:19:55,200
that's not why that's just because uncle

587
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:56,399
larry did it maybe uncle larry's plants

588
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,840
are way different than yours maybe

589
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,120
you're growing indoors uncle larry was

590
00:19:57,839 --> 00:20:01,199
outdoors maybe you're in the northern

591
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:03,038
hemisphere larry was in the southern

592
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,480
[ __ ] could be way different you never

593
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:06,319
know all right i feel like i got good

594
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:09,360
and rambly on that i did say that i've

595
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:10,720
got an update from a previous episode

596
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:13,038
let's jump into that part here trying to

597
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,640
get myself on some sort of a track all

598
00:20:13,038 --> 00:20:16,400
right in a previous episode we talked

599
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:19,200
about trellising our plants we had a

600
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:21,840
listener or a viewer who wanted to use a

601
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,120
by five grow tent they wanted to trellis

602
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:25,199
their plants or have some sort of

603
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:27,359
supports for their buds but if they put

604
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,759
up the trellis they were unable to get

605
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:31,759
to the plants properly we have had some

606
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:33,200
follow-up conversation from that viewer

607
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:35,359
from that listener what they have

608
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,600
decided to do is build the trellis

609
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:39,678
system and an auto watering system and

610
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:41,839
just suck it up their next question was

611
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:44,798
about co2 which i will address in a

612
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:47,519
future episode today let's talk about

613
00:20:44,798 --> 00:20:50,558
the update on the trellis question there

614
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:52,720
was one piece that i greatly overlooked

615
00:20:50,558 --> 00:20:55,519
there's a grower that taught me how to

616
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:58,640
take big pots and build an individual

617
00:20:55,519 --> 00:21:00,400
trellis on each pot i think what he was

618
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,880
using was a 30 gallon tote that he would

619
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,480
put on wheels or on casters and then he

620
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,960
would fill the 30 gallon tote with a

621
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,798
soilless mix or a soil put some holes in

622
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,200
the bottom of that for drainage then he

623
00:21:08,798 --> 00:21:13,759
would use that soilless mix bed as like

624
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,080
a big raised bed then he would build a

625
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:18,319
trellis system out of pvc piping it

626
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:20,240
would put two four posts one post in

627
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:22,079
each corner four posts in there kind of

628
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,240
build like a table and then put a net

629
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:25,918
into the table and then slowly lower

630
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,400
that onto the plants and trellis the

631
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:30,400
plants out with that net that allowed

632
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,919
him to move his plants around he could

633
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,840
move them around the tent around the

634
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:36,240
room around the facility and he could

635
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:39,199
have them trellised out properly so it

636
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:41,038
is possible to build trellis netting for

637
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,319
individual plants i'm not sure why i

638
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:44,558
didn't think about that in the first

639
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:46,000
episode when we talked about this but as

640
00:21:44,558 --> 00:21:47,200
i was listening and editing i was like

641
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
oh you didn't even talk about the

642
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:52,960
opportunity to trellis your big plants

643
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,960
by themselves in a tent so you could

644
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,519
just use like a 30 gallon container i

645
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:59,919
think it's a 30 gallon like a sterlite

646
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:01,519
bin or a rubbermaid bin just uh i think

647
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,200
it's 30 gallons i'm pretty sure that's

648
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:05,279
what it is they're about 30 inches by 20

649
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,360
by about 15. fill that up with your

650
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:08,879
soilless mix or whatever you want to use

651
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:10,959
put plenty of holes in the bottom for

652
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:13,200
drainage put it on casters you can roll

653
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,960
that around then you just build a little

654
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,880
square frame it's a rectangle it's kind

655
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,319
of like a table basically you can get

656
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,559
creative with that as long as you've got

657
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:22,240
posts in each corner then maybe extend

658
00:22:20,558 --> 00:22:24,240
it so it's wider because your plant will

659
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,279
be wider than that pot if you do things

660
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,798
correctly

661
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:28,798
but make some extenders make it go

662
00:22:26,798 --> 00:22:31,279
higher longer however you need it then

663
00:22:28,798 --> 00:22:33,119
just use that pvc frame put your trellis

664
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:34,639
net right on there you can trellis your

665
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:37,119
individual plants of course those are

666
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,559
gigantic plants those are big but that

667
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:40,719
does work

668
00:22:38,558 --> 00:22:42,158
recently while shopping at a big box

669
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,079
hardware store i know i shouldn't go to

670
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:47,840
the big box stores but it was my only

671
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:50,720
option i did see a 16-inch tomato cage

672
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:52,558
with a built-in trellis on the top

673
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:56,079
that's right the top layer of the tomato

674
00:22:52,558 --> 00:22:58,240
cage had a square grid built onto the

675
00:22:56,079 --> 00:23:00,399
top of it so if you want to do a small

676
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,558
individual trellis system that would be

677
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:05,038
a great way to do it just pull one bud

678
00:23:02,558 --> 00:23:06,960
through each square have a nice even

679
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:09,119
canopy going on there that would be a

680
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,840
beautiful idea all right that was my

681
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:13,279
update for the trellising episode i did

682
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:15,439
want to make sure to include those two

683
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:18,798
pieces you can trellis individual pots

684
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:21,840
by building a pvc trellis or you can use

685
00:23:18,798 --> 00:23:23,839
the pre-made circle uh tomato cage with

686
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:26,558
the trellis on top i've also seen people

687
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:28,720
put sticks in each corner use a twisty

688
00:23:26,558 --> 00:23:30,960
tie or that garden tape and just build

689
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:33,440
like a spiral up and use that to put the

690
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:35,919
branches in place get creative you guys

691
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:38,159
once again there's no wrong way to do it

692
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:40,000
as long as the plants are successful as

693
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:42,240
long as you're happy with it there's

694
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,038
always room for improvement but there's

695
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,480
