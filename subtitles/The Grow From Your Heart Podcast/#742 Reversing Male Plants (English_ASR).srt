i do a little bit of a breeding project

53
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:16,399
in a greenhouse i spent part of today

54
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:18,318
making selections for that outdoor run i

55
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,719

77
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:01,519
tuned in future episodes that will come

78
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,519
to light that that information will be

79
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,840
revealed but be patient i'm not ready to

80
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,439
tell anybody yet you'll be excited once

81
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,120
you start hearing the details of what

82
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:10,318
i'm putting outside all right that's

83
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,000
enough chatter here at the start of the

84
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:14,158
show talking about the greenhouse i've

85
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,840
got a great email here in front of me

86
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:17,679
from a person with a very creative name

87
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,319
we will get to that let's do a bit of a

88
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,719
recap on a previous episode probably

89
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:25,280
three maybe four episodes ago i did a

90
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:28,239
talk about reversing female plants to

91
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,640
make them give us pollen so we can make

92
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,080
feminized seeds a lot of people had a

93
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:33,759
great response to that a lot of people

94
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,799
had a great a lot of great questions and

95
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:36,560
feedback

96
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,719
one of the questions and comments and

97
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:42,158
pieces of feedback i received the most

98
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:45,359
was can we or could we or may we or what

99
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:47,679
happens if we attempt to reverse a male

100
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,599
plant can we take a male plant treat it

101
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,719
with a solution and turn it into a

102
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:54,878
female to possibly see what that female

103
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:57,039
plant that male plant would look like as

104
00:03:54,878 --> 00:03:58,639
a female plant a lot of people asked

105
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:00,560
about that a lot of people had a lot of

106
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:02,079
great questions so i do have an email

107
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,840
here we're going to read this one we

108
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:07,120
will use that as a pivot point as a

109
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:09,598
segue to discuss reversing a male plant

110
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:12,400
to have it show female sex the message

111
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:14,079
goes a lot like this it says what's up

112
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,000
bro what's up bro i'm doing good hope

113
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,799
you're well also it says the last

114
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,720
podcast got me thinking i know obviously

115
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:23,039
two dude plants rubbing weiners together

116
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:27,199
won't make anything however is it

117
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:29,360
possible to s1 or r1 cross a male using

118
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,199
sts i'm just thinking it would be an

119
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,280
excellent way to somewhat preserve

120
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:36,478
genetics of a breed or male and make

121
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:38,478
some meninized or masculinized seeds or

122
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:40,800
even see what type of female traits the

123
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:42,719
male offers i don't know if this is even

124
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,439
possible does this only work for me

125
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,199
females i'm just an overthinking stoner

126
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:49,759
i hope to hear from you or catch this on

127
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:52,478
a podcast one day much love from our

128
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,160
friend joe jizz big shout out to my

129
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:56,240
buddy joe jizz i've never really thought

130
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,680
i'd say that on the show but big up for

131
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,000
the great question

132
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,560
i hope to hear uh from you or catch this

133
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,478
on the podcast well here you are mr jizz

134
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,478
i'm gonna answer your question in detail

135
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:07,680
here on the podcast

136
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:10,800
we can

137
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,720
reverse a male plant to show us its

138
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,360
potential as a female the reason we

139
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,039
would do that is exactly what i said we

140
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,439
want to see its potential as a female

141
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:21,599
which would show me what it will deliver

142
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:24,000
to my breeding project if i take this

143
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,759
male plant turn it into a girl i've got

144
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,120
a good idea of what the girl offspring

145
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,038
are going to look like as usable

146
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,720
smokable buds it's a completely

147
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:32,159
different structure a completely

148
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,160
different idea a completely different

149
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,680
purpose so i want to take that male

150
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,960
plant and turn it into a girl and see

151
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,360
what it's going to look like there are

152
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:40,799
ways to do that that is viable that is

153
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,360
possible

154
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,319
i wouldn't do it i personally wouldn't

155
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,439
do it

156
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:50,240
to show me what that plant possibly may

157
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:52,560
look like as a female because in my

158
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:56,000
theory in my opinion and the time it

159
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:58,240
would take a grower to reverse a male

160
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,560
plant and turn it to female

161
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,400
i could have grown the male plant and

162
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,839
put pollen on a true female and just

163
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:05,758
made a bunch of seeds and then grow

164
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:08,159
those and actually have

165
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:10,240
real viable seeds that will show me what

166
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,960
the progeny looks like instead of

167
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,478
reversing the male it takes nearly the

168
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:16,560
same amount of time except i have seeds

169
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:17,918
i have to grow but it's more fun to me i

170
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,519
get seeds at the end of it i don't just

171
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:20,959
get one reversed plant that i can't

172
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:22,959
really do anything with because i'm not

173
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:24,879
going to smoke it or consume it because

174
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:26,879
it's been treated and it's been reversed

175
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:29,038
it's going to show me potentially what

176
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:30,240
it would look like as a female kind of

177
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:31,038
it's going to

178
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,560
it

179
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:33,918
it's going to be a little bit wonky

180
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,680
you'll be able to tell that something

181
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:37,120
happened to it it'll still have an

182
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,720
adam's apple or wide shoulders or

183
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,000
something you'll know but it will give

184
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,800
you an idea of what it's going to look

185
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,079
like as a female so it will work but in

186
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,840
the time it's going to take you to

187
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:47,839
reverse that plant i've already grown

188
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:49,679
out my male pollinated females and i'm

189
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:51,119
growing out the seeds to see what my

190
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,199
breeding project is i'm already a step

191
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,598
ahead of the person who didn't uh waste

192
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:58,000
time doing that so it's very possible uh

193
00:06:55,598 --> 00:06:58,879
the reason that we would do it is now

194
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,800
making

195
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:02,399
male seeds or masculine or mennonized

196
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,000
seeds that doesn't

197
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:05,679
really interest me i wouldn't want to

198
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,439
preserve a breed or male i can make

199
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,800
seeds i know that in a batch of seeds

200
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:11,199
there'll be males or females i know if

201
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,720
i've got all females i can make a male

202
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,560
out of that or a pollen donor out of

203
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,120
that so that's not something that gets

204
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,199
my attention but it is possible it is a

205
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,598
viable option for somebody it's not an

206
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:24,000
avenue that i want to explore but it is

207
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:26,240
something that could be done um you

208
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,598
could make an s1 or r1 cross yes you can

209
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,120
do that now let's talk about i've got

210
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:30,560
some notes here on the computer that i

211
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,759
want to jump into

212
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,360
um

213
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,120
so when you reverse the mail it shows it

214
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,280
as a female i said kinda it gives an

215
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,120
idea of its potential but it only shows

216
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:40,638
what it will look like as a female it

217
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,720
doesn't show what it's going to do in a

218
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,478
breeding project we will see what it

219
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,160
looks like as a female but that doesn't

220
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:47,359
show what's going to pass if we do

221
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,759
breeding

222
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,080
we can see that there's this trait and

223
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,598
this trait as a female and we know that

224
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:55,519
it'll express that but when we breed it

225
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:57,199
to other plants how much of that stuff

226
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:58,478
moves over how much of that carries how

227
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:01,038
much of that is shared into the

228
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:02,800
offspring so once again i feel like if i

229
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:05,279
just pollinated and grew out the seeds

230
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,199
i'm getting much more uh progress much

231
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:09,519
more details much more info a lot more

232
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,280
data because now i know

233
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:13,918
i always talk about when i pollinate i

234
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:16,399
never use a male i rarely use a male to

235
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:18,799
pollinate one plant most of the time if

236
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:21,279
i'm using a boy he's gonna pollinate at

237
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,759
least four six maybe nine or ten

238
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:25,519
different girls because when i grow the

239
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:28,479
seeds from those nine or ten different

240
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:30,478
girls i can see what that male is doing

241
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:32,639
amongst a different population of

242
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:33,838
different female plants if i cross let's

243
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:35,360
say i take a lemon we're just going to

244
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,599
pick lemon because lemons are very easy

245
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,440
to work with flavor take a lemon male

246
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,680
and cross it to a strawberry female a

247
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,440
blueberry female a chocolate female i

248
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:45,519
don't want to see lemon come out of all

249
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,760
these crosses i want to see a blend of

250
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:50,000
lemon strawberry lemonade i want lemon

251
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:51,600
blueberry i want lemon chocolate or

252
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,600
chocolate lemon i don't want that lemon

253
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,680
to wash over everything

254
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,360
so i want to see what the lemon is

255
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:58,879
contributing so i'm going to mix it to a

256
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,240
lot of different other things pour that

257
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:02,639
lemon juice on a lot of other things

258
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,120
taste it see what works best if i only

259
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:06,879
cross it to one thing i don't really i

260
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,720
can see that it got this and this but is

261
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:10,720
that a one-time thing is that an anomaly

262
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,240
is that what it actually passes is that

263
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,519
how it does it play well with others

264
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,278
does it get along with just that one

265
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,480
plant it's kind of the thing so i can

266
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:18,480
see that by actually doing the

267
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,920
pollination the reversal is cool it

268
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,159
shows you a lot of cool [ __ ] but we

269
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:24,079
don't see what it does as breeding so

270
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:26,240
it's fun it gives you a lot of details

271
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,160
but it's not as effective as i would

272
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,159
want it to be for the amount of time

273
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:33,439
effort energy and expense which it takes

274
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:35,838
me to do that project um

275
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,440
making a plant show reverse and show its

276
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,959
potential probably takes longer than

277
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,720
breeding it and growing out those seeds

278
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:41,919
from multiple females is what i wrote in

279
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,839
my notes i'm just covering the notes

280
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:45,679
make sure i get all the stuff here so

281
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:48,560
one thing i should definitely cover and

282
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:50,799
talk about is we're doing something

283
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:53,518
different when we were reversing when we

284
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:55,679
are attempting to reverse the male plant

285
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,679
uh compared to when we were reversing

286
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:59,519
the female so that means we need a

287
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:02,319
different solution we want to do

288
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:04,959
basically the opposite um when we are

289
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:07,760
making fems we want to stop the ethylene

290
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:10,159
production when we are reversing a

291
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:11,919
female to make it a male

292
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:13,278
or reversing a male to make it a female

293
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:14,799
see i'm even getting confused on all

294
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:17,200
this new stuff the future is weird you

295
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:19,919
guys when we're making fem seeds we want

296
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,600
to stop the ethylene production when

297
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:23,439
we're doing the opposite we want to

298
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,720
encourage and promote that ethylene

299
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,279
production and do things a little bit

300
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,600
differently so we use a different

301
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:31,519
chemical or a different solution for

302
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,920
this project we use a chemical or a

303
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:36,919
product called ethaphon and it's spelled

304
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:36,919
e-t-h-a-p-h-o-n

305
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:41,199
ethephon is what i believe the product

306
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:43,439
is called the chemical is called i use

307
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:46,000
that product to reverse the male plant

308
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,600
to show its female sex

309
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,879
the product that you would buy is called

310
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,079
ethaphon 2 sl if you're shopping if

311
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:54,720
you're going to do it that's the product

312
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:56,000
you need here i go with my rant

313
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,519
if you're going to play with any

314
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,480
chemicals if you're going to apply any

315
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,959
products

316
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:03,839
read the labels read the manuals read

317
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:05,278
the safety data sheets also after that

318
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,600
where all of the recommended and

319
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:09,759
required personal protective equipment

320
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,759
if you get hurt if you get sick if you

321
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:14,480
go blind if you [ __ ] up and do something

322
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:16,559
wrong i am not responsible for your

323
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,159
dipshittery i'm telling you right now

324
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:19,679
read the [ __ ] label wear the

325
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:21,919
protective equipment if you hurt

326
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:24,958
yourself make yourself sick [ __ ] up some

327
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:26,879
plants have a bad time not my fault bro

328
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:29,679
i'm telling you read the label do [ __ ]

329
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:31,600
correctly do [ __ ] carefully um when

330
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:33,759
you're mixing when you're applying have

331
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,920
gloves have goggles if it recommends

332
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:38,078
anything else wear that stuff when you

333
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:39,679
were spraying the plant remove that one

334
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:42,239
plant from the grow environment put it

335
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:44,479
in a safe place spray the one plant wait

336
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,240
till it dries then put that plant back

337
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,920
in the rest of the environment or you

338
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,720
will run the risk of getting the other

339
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:52,240
plants a reversal spray on accident

340
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,800
those other plants didn't sign up for a

341
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:57,759
sex change let's not do that to them so

342
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:59,759
the product you want is ethephone2sl

343
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:02,319
be very careful when you were using it

344
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:03,360
apply it to the plant is to where it's

345
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,440
uh

346
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,200
dripping off but not [ __ ] soaking off

347
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,480
the plant you want it kind of saturated

348
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,000
but you don't want it raining off

349
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,240
because then too much of it falls off

350
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,879
you want it to stay on the leaf

351
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,720
possibly consider using a a wetting

352
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:18,958
agent a sticker a spreader sticker to

353
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:22,079
keep that on to the plant a little bit

354
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:24,000
better also don't just spray the leaves

355
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:26,239
spray the stems and the stalks as well

356
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,200
get the plant fully wet with the

357
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:32,240
ethaphon 2sl spray now let's talk about

358
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:34,079
dilutions i use very little too much of

359
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,919
this stuff and the plants go

360
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:37,759
and they just start twisting up and they

361
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:39,360
start getting weird crazy arms and they

362
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:40,319
start showing you that they are pissed

363
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,120
off

364
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:46,240
i recommend you start with approximately

365
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:50,440
a one to one hundred ratio that's right

366
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:53,360
one milliliter of ethaphon 2sl to

367
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:55,600
199 milliliters of distilled water so

368
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:58,320
it's a one to i do one and a hundred

369
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:01,839
milliliters it's a one to a 100 ratio

370
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:03,519
maybe even a half or 0.7 of a milliliter

371
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:06,000
if you can measure that small i don't

372
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:08,320
have a device to measure that small

373
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,078
maybe you quantify it go bigger do a lot

374
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:13,040
of water and then more of the ethe fonts

375
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:16,159
you could do the math but about half to

376
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:18,078
one milliliter per 100 milliliters of

377
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:20,639
water is enough more than that and the

378
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:22,399
plants will get pissed off i don't have

379
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,720
enough experience with this to give you

380
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:26,639
a lot of details i've done this

381
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,160
i can't say i did this i was involved

382
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,639
with this project i did this with

383
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:32,480
somebody else i was kind of the uh i was

384
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,680
the one watching and taking notes we

385
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,120
were doing it together but they were

386
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:37,199
much more excited about it so i just

387
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,519
kind of observed and i was there but we

388
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,920
did it with the ethephon 2sl

389
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:44,159
we sprayed multiple plants a lot of them

390
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:46,639
crinkled up curled went to [ __ ] some of

391
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:49,759
them can take it very well we noticed it

392
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:52,240
is ratio dependent also very strain

393
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:53,919
dependent and the plants look ugly as

394
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,519
hell once they're transitioning to

395
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:57,599
females they're not attractive in any

396
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:59,600
way shape or form once they finish up

397
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,278
they get kind of weird kind of strange

398
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,278
and if you uh don't

399
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:04,879
uh spray one time with that the font

400
00:14:03,278 --> 00:14:06,879
i've learned that one spray of that the

401
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:09,120
font will do it if you spray too many

402
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:11,360
times they definitely freak out later in

403
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,039
flower all right that is all i've got

404
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,800
for you with reversing males that is all

405
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:16,799
the experience all the info all the data

406
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:18,799
that i've got it does work it is

407
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:21,439
possible however i don't find it to be

408
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:24,719
useful because i can get more data in my

409
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:26,880
opinion um from just breeding that plant

410
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,278
to females i get more feedback more data

411
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:30,720
and i get seeds if i'm just reversing it

412
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:32,399
i don't have [ __ ] to show for my work

413
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,800
except for some half-assed data that is

414
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,879
my opinion it does work

415
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:38,958
it will show you potential uh we use a

416
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:42,879
different solution we use the ethaphon

417
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:45,439
2sl i apply it at a 1 to 100 ratio i

418
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:47,120
apply it one time the day we put the

419
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,639
plants into flower that's all it needs

420
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,078
and it should work

421
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,600
that's all i've got for you if you have

422
00:14:50,078 --> 00:14:52,799
any questions corrections comments or
