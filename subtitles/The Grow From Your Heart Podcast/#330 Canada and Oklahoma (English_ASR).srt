what we are smoking on like how you

67
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:22,030
feeling over there bake a baked like a

68
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:23,560
cake we were smoking this on the last

69
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:25,090
episode you guys were in love with it

70
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,949
I'm in love with it it is the sinful

71
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:29,039
banana sauce from contraband

72
00:02:26,949 --> 00:02:31,348
concentrates that is the in-house

73
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:33,879
concentrate company at a cut above

74
00:02:31,348 --> 00:02:35,768
dispensary in Colorado Springs the

75
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:38,799
sinful banana sauce comes in at eighty

76
00:02:35,769 --> 00:02:40,930
seven point eight percent THC a is a

77
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,599
cross of sin mint cookies and honey

78
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:45,640
bananas and this stuff is delicious I

79
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:47,738
approve it tastes really good but the

80
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:49,268
other one hit me substantially harder

81
00:02:47,739 --> 00:02:51,610
I'm reaching for that one now to talk

82
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:53,260
about that that is the Durban cush sauce

83
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:55,660
from the same company the same place

84
00:02:53,259 --> 00:02:59,199
this one tested at ninety point three

85
00:02:55,659 --> 00:03:02,500
percent THC eight but it's also got two

86
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:04,568
point one percent THC added to the label

87
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:06,580
there the other one didn't have that

88
00:03:04,568 --> 00:03:07,869
listed so that might be what's uh what's

89
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:09,099
giving you that extra punch I don't know

90
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:12,969
the other one doesn't have any of that

91
00:03:09,098 --> 00:03:13,959
stuff listed it's blank there so maybe

92
00:03:12,969 --> 00:03:14,889
that's what's giving you Dexter I don't

93
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:16,420
know that should be listed on the other

94
00:03:14,889 --> 00:03:19,599
container honestly that doesn't make any

95
00:03:16,419 --> 00:03:23,018
sense to me but yeah the Durban cush

96
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:25,269
this one's got that and it's super

97
00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:27,849
Durbin II smell to it what a Papa

98
00:03:25,269 --> 00:03:29,650
doesn't have dyed pine into it but it's

99
00:03:27,849 --> 00:03:32,229
very Durbin II it seems like the cush

100
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:33,939
took out that pine end it's got sort of

101
00:03:32,229 --> 00:03:37,449
a sweet into it like a candy sort of a

102
00:03:33,939 --> 00:03:39,129
thing and that look at the crystals in

103
00:03:37,449 --> 00:03:40,539
that one bro yeah big old chunky

104
00:03:39,129 --> 00:03:42,489
crystals in there my dad was really

105
00:03:40,539 --> 00:03:44,379
pretty yeah Mike's dad was bit more than

106
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:45,939
the brain yeah it kind of ran him over

107
00:03:44,379 --> 00:03:47,739

108

said two years ago you guys were trying

118
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:15,730
to sue us for having cannabis and now

119
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:18,459
you in 2014 the Oklahoma was part of a

120
00:04:15,729 --> 00:04:22,360
lawsuit suing Colorado for our audacity

121
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:25,810
to legalize marijuana in the this week

122
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:28,629
last week Oklahoma legalized medical a

123
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:32,230
more liberal legalization

124
00:04:28,629 --> 00:04:34,389
than any state since California there's

125
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:36,400
not a list of qualifying conditions a

126
00:04:34,389 --> 00:04:38,529
doctor you know sign up recommendation

127
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:40,000
for any condition you see spit here she

128
00:04:38,529 --> 00:04:41,589
sees bit too that's pretty cool

129
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,720
so if they just say yeah you can have it

130
00:04:41,589 --> 00:04:45,699
yep yes or no

131
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:48,360
there you go yeah and on top of that

132
00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:50,680
they can have three ounces in public wow

133
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,900
yeah wow that's pretty cool we can only

134
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:55,360
have as a recreational patient you carry

135
00:04:52,899 --> 00:04:57,009
two is a direct patient carry one is a

136
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,050
medical patient you can carry two so

137
00:04:57,009 --> 00:05:00,250
that's a little different there you guys

138
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:02,139
I just realize in the headphones you may

139
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:04,269
be able to hear my air conditioning it's

140
00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:05,560
a little clicky floppy tingly sound in

141
00:05:04,269 --> 00:05:07,349
the background I'm trying to filter that

142
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,579
out with some pressure here oh it's uh

143
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:10,960
it's a hundred and four degrees you guys

144
00:05:09,579 --> 00:05:12,339
you have to just let me have a little

145
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:13,870
air conditioning in the background today

146
00:05:12,339 --> 00:05:15,879
and we'll try not to complain to the

147
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:17,769
station it's after nine o'clock at night

148
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:19,810
and it's over 90 degrees outside here

149
00:05:17,769 --> 00:05:21,250
we're used to [ __ ] yeah I got it up on

150
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:23,110
high still I just reach down to to turn

151
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:24,610
up the compressor on the audio equipment

152
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:26,199
I was like no that's pretty much where

153
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:27,490
it goes it's not gonna if it goes any

154
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:29,050
higher we're gonna start cut now that's

155
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:30,280
why you hear our voices get short

156
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:32,410
sometimes at the end of the words don't

157
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:33,549
finish typing a presser up but we're

158
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:34,930
just gonna have to deal with that sound

159
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:35,800

00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:17,740
industry and if you don't want to be

179

00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:24,280
marketing sales yes also security I was

181
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:26,050
gonna say they're gonna be ancillary

182
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:28,119
businesses that pop up you're gonna it's

183
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:30,670
Moshe is you've got another business

184
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:33,970
like if you're a contractor or tradesman

185
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:36,759
HVAC start thinking that way HVAC techs

186
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:37,750
electricians yep you're gonna need

187
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:39,069
somebody they're gonna need somebody

188
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:40,779
that can drive a forklift in their new

189
00:06:39,069 --> 00:06:42,038
facilities but what I'm saying is go get

190
00:06:40,779 --> 00:06:43,418
in there and get a head start

191
00:06:42,038 --> 00:06:45,818
and also if you're not gonna be involved

192
00:06:43,418 --> 00:06:47,378
in the weed industry maybe open a head

193
00:06:45,819 --> 00:06:50,169
shop so many head shops are gonna pop up

194
00:06:47,379 --> 00:06:51,939
open up a gross store open up all the

195
00:06:50,168 --> 00:06:53,168
laws and go along with it lodging

196
00:06:51,939 --> 00:06:54,430
because now more people are gonna be

197
00:06:53,168 --> 00:06:56,829
coming there what's medical marijuana

198
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:58,478
it's not recreational so it's not gonna

199
00:06:56,829 --> 00:06:59,859
have as much impact as it did here

200
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:02,978
because people come here to buy it

201
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:05,408
let's but container places places that

202
00:07:02,978 --> 00:07:07,778
make containers for the product when we

203
00:07:05,408 --> 00:07:10,438
go to the conventions here a good

204
00:07:07,778 --> 00:07:13,240
portion of all of the booths are simply

205
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:15,849
medical approved containers that we can

206
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:18,370
retail our products and so maybe have a

207
00:07:15,848 --> 00:07:20,259
container company they're gonna need

208
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:21,848
representatives for their companies that

209
00:07:20,259 --> 00:07:23,649
will drive around up and down the state

210
00:07:21,848 --> 00:07:25,838
or you're a square so all over the state

211
00:07:23,649 --> 00:07:27,610
and call Russia's 1 highway you go up

212
00:07:25,838 --> 00:07:28,990
and down all day long and you go sell

213
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:30,669
products up and down that highway but

214
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:32,559
you're gonna want to drive around your

215
00:07:30,668 --> 00:07:34,299
state and represent your brand maybe

216
00:07:32,559 --> 00:07:36,159
that's your niche but find your way in

217
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:37,889
there if not in the industry itself in

218
00:07:36,158 --> 00:07:39,879
an ancillary business if you're not

219
00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:41,079
comfortable or allowed to get in that

220
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:42,520
industry maybe you just want to be on

221
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:44,438
the fringe get an ancillary business

222
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:46,448
that's a part of it there are a lot of

223
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:48,129
things it will be involved with cannabis

224
00:07:46,449 --> 00:07:50,499
becoming legal Mike you got some more

225
00:07:48,129 --> 00:07:54,399
notes over there about Oklahoma not

226
00:07:50,499 --> 00:07:55,899
especially okay I I wanted to get a

227
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:58,088
little more in-depth but I did now I'm

228
00:07:55,899 --> 00:08:00,430
saving some of the commentary for after

229
00:07:58,088 --> 00:08:02,079
we do Canada for after we do Canada well

230
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:03,639
then yeah that's a good segue I guess

231
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:06,908
it's a lot that a plot that I want to

232
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:10,269
say that applies to both locales but

233
00:08:06,908 --> 00:08:12,519
Canada legalized yeah okay I'm just

234
00:08:10,269 --> 00:08:14,348
going legit yes they talked about it a

235
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:17,228
long time ago and now they are doing it

236
00:08:14,348 --> 00:08:19,838
Canada has legalized cannabis it was a

237
00:08:17,228 --> 00:08:24,008
campaign promise that they carried

238
00:08:19,838 --> 00:08:27,788
through on and on October 17 marijuana

239
00:08:24,009 --> 00:08:29,769
will be legal across the country it's

240
00:08:27,788 --> 00:08:31,990
split up in two Providence's just let

241
00:08:29,769 --> 00:08:34,269
her provinces look just like the US is

242
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:36,729
split up into States and just like the

243
00:08:34,269 --> 00:08:40,658
US every province is gonna have their

244
00:08:36,729 --> 00:08:42,310
own laws it looks like completely I've

245
00:08:40,658 --> 00:08:44,948
got some outline of some of the basic

246
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:47,500
rules but it looks like it's gonna vary

247
00:08:44,948 --> 00:08:51,599
pretty heavily from one part of Canada

248
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:54,159
to the next state-run stores in one part

249
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,000
couple hundred stores that are privately

250
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:58,569
owned and another

251
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,669
no stores in another Wow some areas

252
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:02,950
allow commercial growth some areas don't

253
00:09:00,669 --> 00:09:06,849
some areas allow home growth some areas

254
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:09,700
don't some legalize for everybody when

255
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:12,600
they turn 18 Alberta in Quebec it'll be

256
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:15,879
legal once you turn 18 all other

257
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:18,519
provinces it won't be legal authority I

258
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:21,039
know the anti pot groups are just

259
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:24,370
shocked that they didn't go with 21 like

260
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:25,839
we did right right an 18 and 19 is weird

261
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:27,940
to have two different ages because what

262
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:29,320
if you are 19 and you have your weed and

263
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:30,520
you drive across state lines like oh

264
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:33,040
[ __ ] I gotta throw my weed out the

265
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:34,779
window now yeah yeah I just can't take

266
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:36,189
it with you there I guess that's we have

267
00:09:34,779 --> 00:09:38,559
similar problems here but that's so

268
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:40,780
weird like just an age difference yep

269
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:43,859
four plants per household it looks like

270
00:09:40,779 --> 00:09:46,899
but it depends again on your area

271
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:48,879
Quebec in Manitoba specifically have

272
00:09:46,899 --> 00:09:51,120
already banned home grows completely

273
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:53,529
like all forms of home grown oh wow

274
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:56,139
Canada's got an interest in cannabis

275
00:09:53,529 --> 00:09:58,149
history they basically went through what

276
00:09:56,139 --> 00:09:59,649
Puebla is going through now or ours part

277
00:09:58,149 --> 00:10:01,629
of Colorado's going through now with all

278
00:09:59,649 --> 00:10:03,309
the illegal home gross they did that in

279
00:10:01,629 --> 00:10:05,350
the early thousand yeah yeah we learned

280
00:10:03,309 --> 00:10:08,409
a lot of what we know from Canada a lot

281
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:10,810
of people remember the ice out in Canada

282
00:10:08,409 --> 00:10:12,789
power went out for a long time in Canada

283
00:10:10,809 --> 00:10:14,019
and people were managing grows and that

284
00:10:12,789 --> 00:10:15,429
was a huge thing that we were paying

285
00:10:14,019 --> 00:10:17,919
attention to on the Internet at that

286
00:10:15,429 --> 00:10:19,209
time and then after that a lot of things

287
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:20,649
went wrong and a lot of the Canadian

288
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:22,629
growers got in trouble that's where the

289
00:10:20,649 --> 00:10:26,709
romulan comes from you guys is Canada

290
00:10:22,629 --> 00:10:28,659
romulan is a Canadian strain when I was

291
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:31,990
in college all the best came down from

292
00:10:28,659 --> 00:10:32,980
Canada but their history with it's a

293
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:36,029
little different than ours their

294
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:38,409
politics was way different than ours so

295
00:10:36,029 --> 00:10:39,970
they went about this a very different

296
00:10:38,409 --> 00:10:42,159
way than the u.s. yeah they did yeah

297
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:44,110
they definitely did the age difference

298
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:45,730
that just automatically before it even

299
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:48,009
starts just no home grows in some places

300
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:52,300
that's pretty intense oh they they

301
00:10:48,009 --> 00:10:54,129
wanted this the the government wanted to

302
00:10:52,299 --> 00:10:56,259
do this early summer was when they

303
00:10:54,129 --> 00:10:58,929
wanted to roll this out and they delayed

304
00:10:56,259 --> 00:11:00,789
it till October to give all the

305
00:10:58,929 --> 00:11:03,639
different little of local governments a

306
00:11:00,789 --> 00:11:05,199
chance to weigh in and hash all this out

307
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:08,319
and figure out how they wanted to play

308
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:10,240
it local control is kind of a big piece

309
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,590
this from what I see isn't that kind of

310
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,090
the opposite of how we do it here in the

311
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:14,320
states in the states we can I say hey

312
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:18,160
we've got this idea we're gonna make

313
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:19,900
these new rules go and then you go and

314
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:21,819
then along the way they go oh we didn't

315
00:11:19,899 --> 00:11:23,740
see that rule we're gonna have to dial

316
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:25,629
that and they just go make a new yeah so

317
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:26,980
they seem to have gotten it right even

318
00:11:25,629 --> 00:11:29,500
though we don't agree with everything

319
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:31,629
roll out slower they did it seems to

320
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:33,700
have worked better they have some things

321
00:11:31,629 --> 00:11:35,889
I really wish we had that would make

322
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:38,350
this rollout easier so what a national

323
00:11:35,889 --> 00:11:44,080
health care oh yeah I'm that simplifies

324
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:47,529
this [ __ ] a lot they're known for being

325
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:50,020
more just chill more polite and that

326
00:11:47,529 --> 00:11:51,909
helps their politics like their politics

327
00:11:50,019 --> 00:11:53,409
follow suit a little bit at least in the

328
00:11:51,909 --> 00:11:55,539
national media I've never been to Canada

329
00:11:53,409 --> 00:11:58,600
for more than like 15 minutes so since

330
00:11:55,539 --> 00:12:01,179
the medical industry isn't going to lose

331
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:04,000
business because it's not a business in

332
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:06,639
Canada as much as it is here they're not

333
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,950
lobbying against marijuana as much as

334
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:11,830
what you kind of said I haven't followed

335
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:14,890
this that closely but pretty much all

336
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:16,900
the marijuana and entities in Canada

337
00:12:14,889 --> 00:12:20,409
that I follow have been at least

338
00:12:16,899 --> 00:12:22,360
generally in support of this change some

339
00:12:20,409 --> 00:12:24,339
of the longtime activists are getting

340
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:26,350
really pissed right now because like new

341
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:27,790
politicians like look what we did and

342
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:30,430
they're like go [ __ ] yourself we've been

343
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:31,990
fighting for this for 30 years and now

344
00:12:30,429 --> 00:12:35,139
you're doing it in a way that kind of

345
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:36,909
excludes us and so that some of those

346
00:12:35,139 --> 00:12:40,779
factions are starting to get a really

347
00:12:36,909 --> 00:12:42,730
pissed but a lot of those people at the

348
00:12:40,779 --> 00:12:45,490
same time have been really really really

349
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:48,430
pushing the envelope for a long time

350
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:50,019
that's how we got here and I can't fault

351
00:12:48,429 --> 00:12:53,589
them for continuing to do what got us

352
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:55,659
here like without them we wouldn't be a

353
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:56,170
collar right and be here Canada wouldn't

354
00:12:55,659 --> 00:12:58,319
be legal

355
00:12:56,169 --> 00:13:03,699
Oklahoma wouldn't have just gone medical

356
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:06,700
but for the most part like just having a

357
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:09,190
more calm political system they were

358
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:10,629
able to have discussions in an adult

359
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:13,030
manner that we're not able to have here

360
00:13:10,629 --> 00:13:15,009
yeah things are we get he automatically

361
00:13:13,029 --> 00:13:17,350
here the extremes yes like when you

362
00:13:15,009 --> 00:13:20,019
bring up marijuana legalization you're

363
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:21,519
automatically talking about teenagers

364
00:13:20,019 --> 00:13:22,000
getting stoned and killing people on the

365
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,460
highway

366
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,129
Ravin white edges or it causing

367
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:29,170
schizophrenia or like you just

368
00:13:27,129 --> 00:13:31,149
immediately the conversation is extreme

369
00:13:29,169 --> 00:13:35,319
everybody is Maury no doubt instantly

370
00:13:31,149 --> 00:13:37,419
you know there was a lot less of that

371
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:40,600
pretty much the only big anti marijuana

372
00:13:37,419 --> 00:13:46,179
group up there Sam Canada and there of

373
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:47,620
[ __ ] horrible export of ours so

374
00:13:46,179 --> 00:13:49,000
they're mostly all about it and Canada

375
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:50,830
has been pretty pretty relaxed on

376
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,019
marijuana waz from what I understand in

377
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:54,580
the past anyway yeah for a very long

378
00:13:53,019 --> 00:13:56,439
time we're getting be stirs delivered in

379
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:58,780
high school years ago just coming down

380
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:01,710
from Canada just flooding it in good old

381
00:13:58,779 --> 00:14:05,230
Canadian we did see it FedEx my dorm

382
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:08,170
nine but like that's the guy I purchased

383
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:09,850
from FedEx from Canada it was wonderful

384
00:14:08,169 --> 00:14:11,829
mad friends up in Oregon and Washington

385
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:14,680
that were showing up in Colorado with

386
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:16,600
that way back in the day they've been

387
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:19,149
fighting the good fight for a long time

388
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:22,509
and it's they're the only the second

389
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:23,980
nation to go nationally after a year

390
00:14:22,509 --> 00:14:26,950
away they're going with a totally

391
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:28,000
different system so again like I'm kind

392
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:30,250
of cheese because we're gonna get a

393
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,529
whole new data set now nice yeah it's

394
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:34,690
kind of fun one of the upsides to the

395
00:14:32,529 --> 00:14:36,419
anti-pot crowd is Canada's gonna have

396
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:39,610
more data collection from the onset

397
00:14:36,419 --> 00:14:42,429
nobody here considered to do it like

398
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:44,500
after a holiday like st. Patrick's Day

399
00:14:42,429 --> 00:14:46,449
liked by the Wednesday after st.

400
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:50,049
Patrick's Day the newspaper has the DUI

401
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:52,030
results from across the state like here

402
00:14:50,049 --> 00:14:53,439
it here it is broken down by county that

403
00:14:52,029 --> 00:14:55,809
were six people in Denver there were two

404
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:58,300
people in Douglas like you can see it

405
00:14:55,809 --> 00:15:00,069
easy because it took mothers against

406
00:14:58,299 --> 00:15:02,169
drunk driving fighting for twenty years

407
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:04,180
to get that system built when we

408
00:15:02,169 --> 00:15:06,639
legalized we like two years later

409
00:15:04,179 --> 00:15:08,169
they're like yeah we don't have a system

410
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,299
like that for weed we don't have any

411
00:15:08,169 --> 00:15:13,120
idea what's going on dealing with this

412
00:15:10,299 --> 00:15:15,759
so just recently there's they've started

413
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,649
to try to collect that data and it's

414
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:20,019
given the anti pop people a chance to be

415
00:15:17,649 --> 00:15:21,639
like lock this there were no cases last

416
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:23,620
year in this case this year there's 900

417
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:25,870
cases and it's like the last year they

418
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:27,070
didn't look yeah we didn't we didn't

419
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:28,629
know there was a test on that we never

420
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:30,970
took notes but they're not gonna have

421
00:15:28,629 --> 00:15:33,730
that advantage in Canada and the data

422
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:35,500
collection is gonna be not complete but

423
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:38,409
more so they're from the outset which

424
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:40,210
one for people like me it's the upside

425
00:15:38,409 --> 00:15:42,189
to legalization like the more research

426
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:44,050
that happens on it the better and idea

427
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:45,640
it becomes yes and then we can see data

428
00:15:44,049 --> 00:15:47,139
and numbers and then we have tangible

429
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:50,259
evidence to pass on to the next people

430
00:15:47,139 --> 00:15:54,850
that are trying to do it the most people

431
00:15:50,259 --> 00:15:57,220
don't really realize how permissive and

432
00:15:54,850 --> 00:16:00,159
infectious our prohibition laws have

433
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:02,200
become over the decades how much of

434
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:05,339
American society they've infected and

435
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:08,350
eroded and [ __ ] up and [ __ ] with it

436
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:11,490
what's what that's continued to do what

437
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:14,649
the ripples from that have done and

438
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:17,740
undoing it in even a little way is good

439
00:16:14,649 --> 00:16:20,230
like earlier we did a Instagram live

440
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:22,269
video and someone asked me what the

441
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:25,029
worst part of Colorado's legalization is

442
00:16:22,269 --> 00:16:27,189
and I couldn't think of an answer like

443
00:16:25,029 --> 00:16:31,299
there are parts that are more annoying

444
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:35,500
than others but there's not one single

445
00:16:31,299 --> 00:16:38,349
part of our incomplete [ __ ] up over

446
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:40,929
restrictive legalization law I don't

447
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:47,230
prefer to it's prohibition counterpart

448
00:16:40,929 --> 00:16:49,289
alright like do you I had to make a

449
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:52,960
transition I came from the black market

450
00:16:49,289 --> 00:16:55,209
much more so than I did but yeah yeah so

451
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:58,960
there was a lifestyle change came with

452
00:16:55,210 --> 00:17:00,490
legalization when this plant was illegal

453
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,780
so it bets back in the day I feel like

454
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:03,549
that's long enough I don't feel

455
00:17:01,779 --> 00:17:06,519
uncomfortable saying this you guys where

456
00:17:03,549 --> 00:17:09,818
we live several years ago don't be too

457
00:17:06,519 --> 00:17:13,900
specific we'd would cost $4,000 a pound

458
00:17:09,818 --> 00:17:15,220
now where we live we'd cost fifteen

459
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:18,189
hundred twelve hundred dollars a pound

460
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:19,870
for the same quality yeah yeah why yeah

461
00:17:18,189 --> 00:17:22,120
just gonna yeah right and there's

462
00:17:19,869 --> 00:17:24,429
nobody's gonna buy it anyway inside the

463
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:27,250
market it's even worse you places like

464
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:29,529
Oregon right now they so over produced

465
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:33,099
and they so restricted the distribution

466
00:17:29,529 --> 00:17:37,269
market that the prices falling out the

467
00:17:33,099 --> 00:17:38,589
floor like imagine now but legalization

468
00:17:37,269 --> 00:17:40,269
did the same thing to the black market

469
00:17:38,589 --> 00:17:42,309
and that's one of the points is it's an

470
00:17:40,269 --> 00:17:44,139
economic weapon against the black market

471
00:17:42,309 --> 00:17:45,639
if I were to continue trying to grow as

472
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:47,710
a lifestyle my product is worth a

473
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,860
quarter of what it used to be it means I

474
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:50,058
get to live a quarter of

475
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:51,678
the way I used to means I get to eat a

476
00:17:50,058 --> 00:17:53,539
quarter of the Thai food I used to eat

477
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:56,660
that means I get to buy a quarter of the

478
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:57,889
door you have to do 150% more or you

479
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:59,509
have to jump into the legal industry

480
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:00,830
because you've got experience and you've

481
00:17:59,509 --> 00:18:01,879
got know-how and you know what to do

482
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:02,869
with it you know how to get in there and

483
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:05,510
lead it and you know a bunch of people

484
00:18:02,869 --> 00:18:06,919
you know that was the way to do it to be

485
00:18:05,509 --> 00:18:08,720
confident and go there and crush it that

486
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:11,210
way though most of the people that tried

487
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,910
to just do 150% more illegal [ __ ] couple

488
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:15,529
of quick they're gone yeah yeah yeah I

489
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:18,440
used to have a house decked out with

490
00:18:15,529 --> 00:18:21,349
lights now I got a t5 and a flowering

491
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:23,808
light it's so much easier yep life is

492
00:18:21,349 --> 00:18:26,178
simpler yep it's less stressful being

493
00:18:23,808 --> 00:18:28,279
legal well Mike I feel like I bartered

494
00:18:26,179 --> 00:18:29,540
your your Canada report you got any more

495
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:32,500
notes on Canada that you want to get

496
00:18:29,539 --> 00:18:35,029
covered before I start specifically but

497
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:36,890
okay so the next piece of this like it's

498
00:18:35,029 --> 00:18:39,200
awesome that Canada is going legal now

499
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:42,770
and it's awesome the Oklahoma one

500
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:45,769
medical but now like a lot of the Nitty

501
00:18:42,769 --> 00:18:49,160
Gritty work begins if you're not already

502
00:18:45,769 --> 00:18:51,769
active in local government get active if

503
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:56,058
you're not already following local state

504
00:18:51,769 --> 00:18:59,389
province country news start following it

505
00:18:56,058 --> 00:19:01,009
now otherwise you'll wake up in the

506
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:03,890
legalisation law will be written to

507
00:19:01,009 --> 00:19:05,960
exclude everybody except people they can

508
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:10,370
come in with several million dollars in

509
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:12,169
open a corporation Colorado pushed out

510
00:19:10,369 --> 00:19:13,969
all the small growers because they were

511
00:19:12,169 --> 00:19:15,259
worried about small-time black market

512
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:17,298
grows

513
00:19:15,259 --> 00:19:19,339
becoming legal and just kind of what

514
00:19:17,298 --> 00:19:23,690
walking a fine line between legal and

515
00:19:19,339 --> 00:19:25,308
illegal so they made you upfront invest

516
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:27,950
as much as they could get away with

517
00:19:25,308 --> 00:19:31,399
making you invest to put that guillotine

518
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:33,169
or around you and now that all the

519
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:35,540
quality is going down because it's just

520
00:19:33,169 --> 00:19:37,700
ran by money a little more passion the

521
00:19:35,539 --> 00:19:40,789
the quality took a huge hit here in

522
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:42,919
Colorado in generally you can still find

523
00:19:40,789 --> 00:19:45,649
what I consider the best herb on the

524
00:19:42,919 --> 00:19:47,929
planet if you take your time to go to

525
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:49,460
the right places and shop around and and

526
00:19:47,929 --> 00:19:51,740
get what you're really looking for but

527
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:55,579
there's a lot of crap

528
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:56,539
a lot of crap available and it sells

529
00:19:55,579 --> 00:19:59,299
unfortunately

530
00:19:56,539 --> 00:20:00,950
it's unfortunately most people that are

531
00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:02,579
in this just for money when they look at

532
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:05,130
their bottom line the the first

533
00:20:02,579 --> 00:20:07,230
they cut his talent his talent cost a

534
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:10,130
lot of money yes they do and they can

535
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:14,730
get their cousin to do the checklist

536
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:16,649
that the talent made and they think it's

537
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:18,149
the same thing and it's not they find

538
00:20:16,648 --> 00:20:21,089
they find out after a couple of crops

539
00:20:18,148 --> 00:20:23,189
that quickly becomes apparent so we were

540
00:20:21,089 --> 00:20:25,319
talking about getting into getting in

541
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:27,000
now getting involved now how can they do

542
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:29,308
that what is it easy what's what's the

543
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,759
first step it starts we get involved

544
00:20:29,308 --> 00:20:35,220
like you have a local newspaper there

545
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:38,879
the the news agency that's going to be

546
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:42,509
covering zoning rules in your area home

547
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:44,460
grow rules in your area zoning for

548
00:20:42,509 --> 00:20:47,250
stores if all that hasn't been finalized

549
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:49,380
yet they're the government agencies

550
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:52,200
making all those decisions and for the

551
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:55,470
most part you can just look up the

552
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:57,389
meeting time and show up and if you do

553
00:20:55,470 --> 00:21:00,058
that a couple of times and just kind of

554
00:20:57,388 --> 00:21:03,148
sit back and observe you can figure out

555
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:05,069
what the little easy process is to go

556
00:21:03,148 --> 00:21:07,638
speak in front of that body and say

557
00:21:05,069 --> 00:21:10,079
whatever you want they've almost

558
00:21:07,638 --> 00:21:13,079
universally got some sort of public

559
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:15,089
forum spot during their regular meetings

560
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:16,470
where you can get up there and rail

561
00:21:15,089 --> 00:21:20,189
about whatever it is you're passionate

562
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:24,630
about and that's the easiest way to

563
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:27,630
really start getting their attention you

564
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:31,110
can also email all these people call all

565
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:33,630
these people local elected officials get

566
00:21:31,109 --> 00:21:37,250
paid to make random people in the public

567
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:39,929
happy that's how they keep their job is

568
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:42,599
making enough people and in the

569
00:21:39,929 --> 00:21:44,278
community they serve wander around and

570
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:47,038
go hey do you know about Bobby down at

571
00:21:44,278 --> 00:21:48,720
the Statehouse he's so helpful that way

572
00:21:47,038 --> 00:21:51,240
they keep their job and so when people

573
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:53,278
call them during the day nine times out

574
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:55,109
of ten they answer and it's just like

575
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:56,788
hello I'm your local elected official

576
00:21:55,109 --> 00:21:58,469
who are you what can I do for you what

577
00:21:56,788 --> 00:22:00,990
can I do you for and even if they

578
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:03,089
disagree with you nine times out of ten

579
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:04,740
they're fairly polite and helpful and

580
00:22:03,089 --> 00:22:06,658
they're like well I disagree with that

581
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:08,730
but if you talk to my co count you know

582
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:10,440
Co commission or so-and-so you know I

583
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:11,909
think he's more receptive to this and

584
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:13,980
he'll be more willing to help you get

585
00:22:11,909 --> 00:22:14,820
whatever you want done submitted in

586
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:16,649
front of our committee

587
00:22:14,819 --> 00:22:18,689
council they could pass you along to the

588
00:22:16,648 --> 00:22:20,788
right person at least hopefully but it

589
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:23,159
starts with just reading the news and

590
00:22:20,788 --> 00:22:24,419
following these stories and going to the

591
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:28,528
meetings and sitting back and observing

592
00:22:24,419 --> 00:22:32,340
and honestly not enough people do it

593
00:22:28,528 --> 00:22:33,929
the people that go are the handful of

594
00:22:32,339 --> 00:22:35,428
people like me that are passionate about

595
00:22:33,929 --> 00:22:38,759
it for some weird sort of broken

596
00:22:35,429 --> 00:22:42,600
childhood reasons and the people who

597
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:44,519
were my exact opposite and against it

598
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:47,490
and those are the people that tend to

599
00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:49,230
dominate the meetings and I finally

600
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:51,419
snapped in one meeting it was like no I

601
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:54,120
can't let people who can't formulate an

602
00:22:51,419 --> 00:22:56,129
entire sentence yeah I know who to speak

603
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:59,038
for my community like he doesn't

604
00:22:56,128 --> 00:23:02,609
represent me at all he's representing my

605
00:22:59,038 --> 00:23:06,210
community badly I can do a better job

606
00:23:02,609 --> 00:23:08,878
guaranteed even as nervous as I am and I

607
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:10,440
started getting up and speaking in it

608
00:23:08,878 --> 00:23:11,759
was terrifying the first time I was on

609
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:14,460
the front page of the local paper

610
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:16,710
it gets annoying as much hate I get from

611
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:19,079
the anti-pot crowd down here but is

612
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:20,278
worth it like without what I did we

613
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:21,240
wouldn't have what we haven't well

614
00:23:20,278 --> 00:23:24,000
that's very true

615
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:26,909
it just took me doing like it just took

616
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,190
one of me to get most of what we have in

617
00:23:26,909 --> 00:23:30,870
public I went to several of those City

618
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:32,759
Council meetings in the first couple I

619
00:23:30,869 --> 00:23:34,648
was just hanging out and attending and

620
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:36,329
it was nerve-racking I was just just

621
00:23:34,648 --> 00:23:38,128
there I wasn't even speaking I wasn't

622
00:23:36,329 --> 00:23:39,778
doing anything but after the second or

623
00:23:38,128 --> 00:23:41,878
third one you get the flow you see how

624
00:23:39,778 --> 00:23:43,200
it goes you hear people speak and then

625
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:45,178
you realize that everyone that goes up

626
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,308
and speaks it's just a working-class

627
00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:48,960
person who just wants some [ __ ] in the

628
00:23:47,308 --> 00:23:52,019
community to be different and that's

629
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,730
they may be judging you because what

630
00:23:52,019 --> 00:23:56,220
you're asking for is cannabis related

631
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:58,528
but at the same time they've got to hear

632
00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:00,288
you and you are their community so

633
00:23:58,528 --> 00:24:02,460
they'll listen so just go a few times

634
00:24:00,288 --> 00:24:04,230
get it figured out find out where you

635
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:05,548
fit in and then speak one day and when

636
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:07,558
you speak other people that are

637
00:24:05,548 --> 00:24:08,940
passionate will see you speak and guys

638
00:24:07,558 --> 00:24:11,278
like myself will walk up to you and go

639
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:12,750
hey bro can you like teach me like

640
00:24:11,278 --> 00:24:14,429
because I don't want to go be involved

641
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:16,470
so much because I look like this and I

642
00:24:14,429 --> 00:24:17,879
do this but it'd be cool to have some

643
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:19,079
knowledge and then you'll start finding

644
00:24:17,878 --> 00:24:20,579
like-minded folks and you'll start

645
00:24:19,079 --> 00:24:22,528
falling in with the right right folks

646
00:24:20,579 --> 00:24:24,720
and then you'll get it figured out when

647
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:27,329
I first got started going we just watch

648
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,558
by the fourth or fifth meeting like

649
00:24:27,329 --> 00:24:29,999
elected official

650
00:24:28,558 --> 00:24:32,730
we're coming up to me after the meeting

651
00:24:29,999 --> 00:24:35,038
and gone why are you here like not to be

652
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:37,470
rude or like to encourage you not to be

653
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:40,829
here it's just like you're not one of

654
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:43,379
the crazies you're not paid they're not

655
00:24:40,829 --> 00:24:46,019
media and you haven't gone got like

656
00:24:43,378 --> 00:24:48,748
freaked out about whatever local rule or

657
00:24:46,019 --> 00:24:51,870
called us fascists or anything yet so

658
00:24:48,749 --> 00:24:53,999
like why are you here and I just calmly

659
00:24:51,869 --> 00:24:55,888
like I'm I've got an issue

660
00:24:53,999 --> 00:24:57,329
that's important to me that's coming up

661
00:24:55,888 --> 00:24:59,638
from in front of council and I wanted to

662
00:24:57,329 --> 00:25:02,278
get a feel for the meetings and they're

663
00:24:59,638 --> 00:25:04,199
like cool like they don't that they're

664
00:25:02,278 --> 00:25:05,940
interested that you're interested is all

665
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,710
yeah even if they disagree with you

666
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:09,808
they're glad you could put a coherent

667
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:12,028
argument together because if you go to a

668
00:25:09,808 --> 00:25:14,460
few of these and watch there'll be three

669
00:25:12,028 --> 00:25:17,669
or four crazy people that have the

670
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:21,269
public speaking rules on lockdown and go

671
00:25:17,669 --> 00:25:23,190
every week to rail and like call your

672
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:24,388
local elected officials fascist and

673
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:25,970
[ __ ] about how they're taking away you

674
00:25:24,388 --> 00:25:28,498
to say it's because it's an always

675
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:30,569
there's always one elderly person

676
00:25:28,499 --> 00:25:33,899
bitching about the same bumpkin thing

677
00:25:30,569 --> 00:25:35,428
for the past eight years in there yep my

678
00:25:33,898 --> 00:25:37,018
mic off so you got to talk for a minute

679
00:25:35,429 --> 00:25:39,960
I'm gonna do a DAB I've had the same

680
00:25:37,019 --> 00:25:42,690
really nice lady come and asked me to

681
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:44,999
stand up in solidarity when she asked me

682
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:46,528
to in you know who in the crowd wants to

683
00:25:44,999 --> 00:25:49,319
impeach the council with me she's

684
00:25:46,528 --> 00:25:50,700
everybody stand up when I say that and

685
00:25:49,319 --> 00:25:52,138
she'll go to everybody in the meeting

686
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:53,788
and spent like an hour talking to people

687
00:25:52,138 --> 00:25:58,439
and then nobody will stand up she's done

688
00:25:53,788 --> 00:25:59,878
a hundred times just go and watch and

689
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:02,369
when you start making a coherent

690
00:25:59,878 --> 00:26:05,759
argument you can see their faces light

691
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:08,490
up like people dying of thirst being

692
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:10,349
offered water thank you because it's a

693
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:13,919
lot of nonsense and when it's not total

694
00:26:10,349 --> 00:26:17,819
nonsense it's ridiculously specific

695
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:20,399
legal jargon that gets read aloud by

696
00:26:17,819 --> 00:26:23,908
somebody with a voice that's designed to

697
00:26:20,398 --> 00:26:25,528
put people to sleep usually and so they

698
00:26:23,909 --> 00:26:28,049
just latch on to whatever you're saying

699
00:26:25,528 --> 00:26:29,700
and I was able to turn seven people who

700
00:26:28,048 --> 00:26:32,429
are definitely against me into five

701
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:34,860
people that were with me in like two

702
00:26:32,429 --> 00:26:37,110
months of just going down and in using a

703
00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:40,319
three minute window to point out

704
00:26:37,109 --> 00:26:42,418
economic benefits of legalization and I

705
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:46,769
wasn't using anything that I didn't

706
00:26:42,419 --> 00:26:48,330
Google if you're not good at asking

707

00:27:45,929 --> 00:27:53,580
to be heated but yeah so yeah we came to

731
00:27:50,009 --> 00:27:57,089
a pause in the show um how is how is

732
00:27:53,579 --> 00:27:58,589
Canada changing how is this going to

733
00:27:57,089 --> 00:28:01,709
affect us in Colorado

734
00:27:58,589 --> 00:28:04,319
Canada's but when Uruguay legalized Oh

735
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:08,129
keep that for you can ah when you're

736
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:10,648
boiling guys the West went so whoo yeah

737
00:28:08,128 --> 00:28:13,079
like cute little old man president yay

738
00:28:10,648 --> 00:28:14,758
like all nine of your people have legal

739
00:28:13,079 --> 00:28:17,038
weed now good for you like that's

740
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:18,628
literally how the West reacted and there

741
00:28:17,038 --> 00:28:20,429
were a couple anti-pop people that were

742
00:28:18,628 --> 00:28:23,748
like this will not stand you were in

743
00:28:20,429 --> 00:28:28,919
convention of 90 but for the most part

744
00:28:23,749 --> 00:28:31,288
no one gave a [ __ ] but Canada's major

745
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:35,340
there a major US trading partner we

746
00:28:31,288 --> 00:28:38,158
share a huge border there in all the

747
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:38,889
summits they participate in all the

748
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:41,110
community

749
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:45,610
of committees they're one of our major

750
00:28:41,109 --> 00:28:48,819
partners in everything this impacts a

751
00:28:45,609 --> 00:28:51,159
lot and stuff that it doesn't directly

752
00:28:48,819 --> 00:28:52,990
impact they're gonna provide us all the

753
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:56,110
data that we need for legalization

754
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:59,259
everywhere else Colorado is doing that

755
00:28:56,109 --> 00:29:00,789
but it's harder to find I have a feeling

756
00:28:59,259 --> 00:29:03,670
that Canada is gonna be really upfront

757
00:29:00,789 --> 00:29:05,289
and loud and proud about this because

758
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:07,990
they've got universal health care they

759
00:29:05,289 --> 00:29:13,990
can track some [ __ ] we can all right a

760
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:15,519
little better and a lot of like that's

761
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:17,140
what I'm really looking forward to about

762
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:18,700
cannabis legalization like I've got

763
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:20,590
legalization here I don't need to travel

764
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:22,269
to enjoy it right y'all want to give me

765
00:29:20,589 --> 00:29:25,480
a killer job in Canada I'm willing to

766
00:29:22,269 --> 00:29:27,460
get we need to get some passports

767
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:31,240

768
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:32,890
they call it there we've both I know

769
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:34,390
that I've been requested my presence has

770
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:36,490
been requested in Canada to help get

771
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:37,960
some things going so I need to try to

772
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:39,579
Tim Hortons for our Canada with

773
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:41,380
listeners but I don't know anything else

774
00:29:39,579 --> 00:29:43,589
about Canada other than I love all the

775
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:46,390
people I've met from what was i taunt

776
00:29:43,589 --> 00:29:47,919
adventure in what I think yeah right

777

French women and I was like well that

779
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:52,930
sounds like a win-win situation for me

780
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:56,259
there's a lot about Canada you'd enjoy

781
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:58,150
everything but the weather I think I was

782
00:29:56,259 --> 00:29:59,950
gonna say it's [ __ ] 100 degrees let's

783
00:29:58,150 --> 00:30:02,800
go let's go here I'm talking funny I

784
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:04,269
actually have a random chatter I lived

785
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:08,139
in Lawrence Kansas and I knew a couple

786
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:09,700
of kids from from Canada coolest [ __ ]

787
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:11,590
kids I hung out with so one dude was a

788
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:13,660
drummer is a huge Neil Peart fan a

789
00:30:11,589 --> 00:30:17,319
he said boss diesel a lot I thought it

790
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:20,170
was pretty funny I'm sticking to it

791
00:30:17,319 --> 00:30:21,159
alright so since Mike is gonna choke for

792
00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:22,480
a couple of minutes I've got an email

793
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:24,370
that I think I should read and now is

794
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,870
probably the best time I'll leave Mike's

795
00:30:24,369 --> 00:30:27,609
microphone on just so that you can hear

796
00:30:25,869 --> 00:30:28,989
him over there I'll put him about

797
00:30:27,609 --> 00:30:31,419
halfway if he decides to talk I'll turn

798
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:32,950

799
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:35,080
Canadian friend and it's perfectly timed

800
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:36,400

807
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:50,380
listening I realized I had to stop and

808
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:52,808
reassess everything I was doing not just

809
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:55,840
in my garden but in my life

810
00:30:52,808 --> 00:30:57,730
was growing illegally putting my family

811
00:30:55,839 --> 00:31:00,249
at risk and doing nothing with the

812
00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:02,048
cannabis knowledge I had so this dude

813
00:31:00,249 --> 00:31:03,129
realized one day probably because I said

814
00:31:02,048 --> 00:31:05,408
you're gonna get [ __ ] raided I've

815
00:31:03,128 --> 00:31:06,939
said that on the show and he thought oh

816
00:31:05,409 --> 00:31:09,519
that man they'll shoot my dog it'll take

817
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:10,659
my kids that's your [ __ ] dog that's

818
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:12,849
the truth as soon as that front door

819
00:31:10,659 --> 00:31:15,519
comes off life sinks in quickly trust me

820
00:31:12,849 --> 00:31:17,168
he says since listening to you and your

821
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:18,788
amazing guests that's you Mike I've

822
00:31:17,169 --> 00:31:20,799
stepped up my game I've become

823
00:31:18,788 --> 00:31:22,778
determined to be a positive light for

824
00:31:20,798 --> 00:31:24,878
cannabis sharing information with anyone

825
00:31:22,778 --> 00:31:26,440
that will listen you have given me the

826
00:31:24,878 --> 00:31:27,788
tools to break down barriers and

827
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:29,769
communicate with the people about

828
00:31:27,788 --> 00:31:31,749
cannabis who are otherwise uninformed

829
00:31:29,769 --> 00:31:33,730
people are overwhelmed with the amount

830
00:31:31,749 --> 00:31:35,440
of cannabis information I am able to

831
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:37,298
clearly articulate to them and I've

832
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:39,249
never had a negative response

833
00:31:37,298 --> 00:31:40,868
I have sought out a company aimed to

834
00:31:39,249 --> 00:31:43,089
assist people in getting people safe

835
00:31:40,868 --> 00:31:44,499
access to cannabis in Canada they're

836
00:31:43,089 --> 00:31:46,898
helping me through the process of

837
00:31:44,499 --> 00:31:49,028
obtaining a personal production license

838
00:31:46,898 --> 00:31:51,459
I am now able to confidently and clearly

839
00:31:49,028 --> 00:31:53,048
express how and why I use cannabis to

840
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:56,619
doctors which is something I would not

841
00:31:53,048 --> 00:31:59,138
have been able to do before he says from

842
00:31:56,618 --> 00:32:01,058
your episodes I was able to build a

843
00:31:59,138 --> 00:32:03,908
cannabis tailored resume and obtain a

844
00:32:01,058 --> 00:32:05,470
position at a licensed producer so we

845
00:32:03,909 --> 00:32:06,490

00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:32,019
involved with my local cannabis

859

information sessions and I participated

861
00:32:33,669 --> 00:32:39,460
in several government engagement surveys

862
00:32:36,999 --> 00:32:41,079
to ensure my voices heard excellent this

863
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:43,028
guy's on the right path good job squishy

864
00:32:41,079 --> 00:32:45,428

865
00:32:43,028 --> 00:32:47,349
will be legal here in Canada in 8 to 12

866
00:32:45,429 --> 00:32:50,110
weeks and I am proud to have been a part

867
00:32:47,349 --> 00:32:52,569
of the process here's the part where it

868
00:32:50,109 --> 00:32:55,148
gets cool dude he says I believe that

869
00:32:52,569 --> 00:32:57,490
you have also contributed indirectly

870
00:32:55,148 --> 00:32:59,829
because without the guidance of you and

871
00:32:57,490 --> 00:33:02,710

depends on how long we go on this one

975
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:28,440
question how long until we're federally

976
00:36:24,869 --> 00:36:29,700
legal here in the States now I used to

977
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:31,880
think about it would take us about

978
00:36:29,699 --> 00:36:34,798
another decade about another decade um

979
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:37,559
if you follow politics at all you know

980
00:36:34,798 --> 00:36:38,568
that everything that's true um one is

981
00:36:37,559 --> 00:36:41,278
true anymore

982
00:36:38,568 --> 00:36:42,509
it's true we live in a banana ranek time

983
00:36:41,278 --> 00:36:48,380
where we're led by an orange crazy

984
00:36:42,509 --> 00:36:50,519
person yes yes so ten years you think

985
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:52,108
I'd be down well I would be cool if I

986
00:36:50,518 --> 00:36:54,298
would be satisfied with seeing so many

987
00:36:52,108 --> 00:36:56,159
there's so many things that are in play

988
00:36:54,298 --> 00:36:57,798
on this particular question are up in

989
00:36:56,159 --> 00:37:00,568
the air right now

990
00:36:57,798 --> 00:37:02,068
that wasn't true under any of the

991
00:37:00,568 --> 00:37:03,329
previous presidents easier I was getting

992
00:37:02,068 --> 00:37:06,058
any other time in our lives I was gonna

993
00:37:03,329 --> 00:37:08,130
add the the deciding factor is probably

994
00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:10,019
the next two presidential elections is

995
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:14,519
what I would decide the midterms are

996
00:37:10,018 --> 00:37:17,098
gonna be insanely important and then the

997
00:37:14,518 --> 00:37:20,368
next presidential is gonna be huge

998
00:37:17,099 --> 00:37:25,289
it'll be huge and the presidential after

999
00:37:20,369 --> 00:37:30,119
that will also be huge yeah by the time

1000
00:37:25,289 --> 00:37:30,589
the next presidential happens like

1001
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:32,509
another

1002
00:37:30,588 --> 00:37:34,400
Supreme Court C will be there open or

1003
00:37:32,509 --> 00:37:40,789
damn near close we just had one open up

1004
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:45,200
this week Senate population changes

1005
00:37:40,789 --> 00:37:49,160
rapidly right now we just saw like a

1006
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:51,228
legit [ __ ] socialist when the person

1007
00:37:49,159 --> 00:37:53,509
who was going to take over for like the

1008
00:37:51,228 --> 00:37:57,468
ranking Democrat they were the next in

1009
00:37:53,509 --> 00:38:00,289
line for the throne got D [ __ ] thrown

1010
00:37:57,469 --> 00:38:03,318
in a primary - like a 28-year old

1011
00:38:00,289 --> 00:38:05,960
unknown chick with like a super

1012
00:38:03,318 --> 00:38:09,199
immigrant a name like she had a long

1013
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:10,969
[ __ ] hill to climb in just home run

1014
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:15,468
home run home run home run won the

1015
00:38:10,969 --> 00:38:17,690
[ __ ] election nice and right now that

1016
00:38:15,469 --> 00:38:20,469
in a couple of other things along with

1017
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:23,028
President Trump and all of those

1018
00:38:20,469 --> 00:38:25,159
everything's like I don't want to get

1019
00:38:23,028 --> 00:38:28,548
into too much and make this show super

1020
00:38:25,159 --> 00:38:30,978
political but a lot of [ __ ] that would

1021
00:38:28,548 --> 00:38:32,989
affect federal legalization happening or

1022
00:38:30,978 --> 00:38:36,078
not happening is all up in the air right

1023
00:38:32,989 --> 00:38:38,420
now the hardcore members of the Senate

1024
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:41,809
that are against it might not have jobs

1025
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:43,909
in six months or a year 18 months the

1026
00:38:41,809 --> 00:38:46,729
people that are for it also might not

1027
00:38:43,909 --> 00:38:48,739
have jobs right everyone can swim

1028
00:38:46,728 --> 00:38:52,058
president Trump could [ __ ] legalize

1029
00:38:48,739 --> 00:38:54,679
it through some sort of bizarre decree

1030
00:38:52,059 --> 00:38:58,369
or he could start really pushing the

1031
00:38:54,679 --> 00:39:00,710
Senate to do it the proper way or he

1032
00:38:58,369 --> 00:39:02,289
could get impeached like just keep going

1033
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:04,579
a lot of fun you can do different ways

1034
00:39:02,289 --> 00:39:09,049
or you could [ __ ] this OD on diet

1035
00:39:04,579 --> 00:39:11,749
pills one day it's the world is a very

1036
00:39:09,048 --> 00:39:13,338
strange place right now and in

1037
00:39:11,748 --> 00:39:15,108
predicting something like federal

1038
00:39:13,338 --> 00:39:18,650
legalization that's gonna take so many

1039
00:39:15,108 --> 00:39:20,929
different acts of line like that's tough

1040
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:22,489
then let I'd I wouldn't expect it

1041
00:39:20,929 --> 00:39:24,649
anytime soon definitely don't invest

1042
00:39:22,489 --> 00:39:27,048
money tomorrow based on it happening

1043
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:28,430
soon one more thing I kind of want to

1044
00:39:27,048 --> 00:39:30,349
touch on that I honestly have no

1045
00:39:28,429 --> 00:39:32,528
education on but I know that this is a

1046
00:39:30,349 --> 00:39:34,910
thing somewhere along the line when

1047
00:39:32,528 --> 00:39:37,489
Canada legalizes can't has legalized

1048
00:39:34,909 --> 00:39:39,469
cannabis and when the state's finally

1049
00:39:37,489 --> 00:39:41,838
legalize federally what sort of

1050
00:39:39,469 --> 00:39:43,630
international rules or treaties are we

1051
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:45,699
breaking because I've heard there

1052
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:50,070
Russia mentioned there's a major UN

1053
00:39:45,699 --> 00:39:55,149
Convention that says you can't legalize

1054
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:58,510
basically narcotics drugs of abuse and

1055
00:39:55,150 --> 00:40:02,710
enjoyment if it's not beer you can't

1056
00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:06,610
legalize yeah yeah it's a policy that

1057
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:08,619
the u.s. really really pushed like it's

1058
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:13,090
basically ours that we forced on the

1059
00:40:08,619 --> 00:40:15,429
rest of the world the rest of the world

1060
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:16,600
was happy to jump on our [ __ ] so

1061
00:40:15,429 --> 00:40:18,879
it's not all our fault

1062
00:40:16,599 --> 00:40:20,829
but it's all our fault so if we look

1063
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,309
donate and now we're falling on it our

1064
00:40:20,829 --> 00:40:23,139
slaves

1065
00:40:21,309 --> 00:40:25,150
there's a number of countries that have

1066
00:40:23,139 --> 00:40:27,519
called us on it and the in the UN and

1067
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:29,619
call this out on our [ __ ] like hey you

1068
00:40:27,519 --> 00:40:32,710
push this on everybody and now Colorado

1069
00:40:29,619 --> 00:40:34,089
and Washington [ __ ] do what I mean

1070
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:38,110
they say it in German so no one in the

1071
00:40:34,090 --> 00:40:40,720
u.s. knows it happened but it did happen

1072
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:42,400
and it's happened repeatedly it just

1073
00:40:40,719 --> 00:40:44,019
hasn't had much of an impact yet the

1074
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:46,389
anti-pop people bring it up every now

1075
00:40:44,019 --> 00:40:49,449
and then it will be in violation of UN

1076
00:40:46,389 --> 00:40:51,519
Convention it's like whoa [ __ ] Russia

1077
00:40:49,449 --> 00:40:54,250
invaded a country and we just kind of

1078
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:57,579
chill it's kind of hang out we no one's

1079
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:59,559
gonna like [ __ ] cut us off trade

1080
00:40:57,579 --> 00:41:00,880
because we legalized weed I thought I

1081
00:40:59,559 --> 00:41:02,380
saw headlines while I was skimming

1082
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,910
through doing a quick a little check

1083
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:05,410
that Russia was already offended that

1084
00:41:03,909 --> 00:41:07,449
we're doing it well that janet is doing

1085
00:41:05,409 --> 00:41:09,219
it that's one of the things that we're

1086
00:41:07,449 --> 00:41:11,099
really gonna see with Canada now like no

1087
00:41:09,219 --> 00:41:13,989
one really cared when Uruguay did it and

1088
00:41:11,099 --> 00:41:16,239
their global impact

1089
00:41:13,989 --> 00:41:18,399
I mean it's substantial for Uruguay but

1090
00:41:16,239 --> 00:41:20,079
it's not substantial for some of the

1091
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,970
other major countries especially when

1092
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:23,679
compared to Canada like they're not

1093
00:41:21,969 --> 00:41:26,619
comparable trading partners as far as

1094
00:41:23,679 --> 00:41:29,019
I'm aware in any way and so when Canada

1095
00:41:26,619 --> 00:41:32,500
does this a lot a lot of people who were

1096
00:41:29,019 --> 00:41:34,300
able to completely ignore Uruguay doing

1097
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:36,369
it cannot at all ignore Canada all right

1098
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:39,700
that makes more sense it makes much more

1099
00:41:36,369 --> 00:41:42,730
sense mm-hmm all right you got any more

1100
00:41:39,699 --> 00:41:44,980
for Canada to make sure we know Canada

1101
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:47,500
there you go way to go Canada will quit

1102
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:51,820
making make it funnier smoke enjoy and

1103
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:53,530
watch Tamaki II guess we're not gonna

1104
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:55,330
make quit making funny because Mike had

1105
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:57,610
one more burn to throw at you

1106
00:41:55,329 --> 00:41:59,049
I love you guys it's I know it's not

1107
00:41:57,610 --> 00:42:00,940
perfect I know there are a lot of issues

1108
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:03,610
with it I know some of the penalties for

1109
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:06,550
going around or outside of the limits

1110
00:42:03,610 --> 00:42:09,550
are just as harsh or harsher than they

1111
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:12,039
are now but trust me give it a few

1112
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:15,280
minutes participate make sure that the

1113
00:42:12,039 --> 00:42:17,199
laws the zoning the distribution stuff

1114
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:21,100
the conversation around it is rational

1115
00:42:17,199 --> 00:42:22,629
and you'll be a lot happier with

1116
00:42:21,099 --> 00:42:25,750
legalization and you ever work with

1117
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:26,860

you can listen to it on the stitcher

1238

website you don't have to use the app

1239
00:46:22,630 --> 00:46:28,298
maybe you can go to YouTube I put every

1240
00:46:24,789 --> 00:46:29,920
single episode on stitcher listener

1241
00:46:28,298 --> 00:46:32,259
who's converted to YouTube I see a lot

1242
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:34,509
or listens on YouTube if you guys

1243
00:46:32,259 --> 00:46:36,338
continue to listen on YouTube I will

1244
00:46:34,509 --> 00:46:38,108
improve the videos I know that sounds

1245
00:46:36,338 --> 00:46:39,608
like I'm bargaining with you but I've

1246
00:46:38,108 --> 00:46:41,500
got more time now and if I see that

1247
00:46:39,608 --> 00:46:43,719
that's a thing I will do it better

1248
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:45,489
when I see that it gets response I will

1249
00:46:43,719 --> 00:46:47,739
improve it but it just takes a lot of

1250
00:46:45,489 --> 00:46:49,000
time to make videos I'll start putting I

1251
00:46:47,739 --> 00:46:50,979
don't want to make these high quality

1252
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,420
videos and have YouTube jack my channel

1253
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:53,949
but they gave custom grow back his

1254
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:57,119
channel they give they're giving people

1255
00:46:53,949 --> 00:47:00,639
back their channels so I think I'm safe

1256
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:03,369
bolted pretty good and I don't know if

1257
00:47:00,639 --> 00:47:06,489
it was enough like that's one of the

1258
00:47:03,369 --> 00:47:09,039
other benefits of being a home country

1259
00:47:06,489 --> 00:47:09,758
being legal yeah that's not an issue

1260
00:47:09,039 --> 00:47:11,289
anymore

1261
00:47:09,759 --> 00:47:13,028
no the heat you're gonna take for

1262
00:47:11,289 --> 00:47:15,190
getting up and standing up and saying

1263
00:47:13,028 --> 00:47:18,219
the rules around this should be rational

1264
00:47:15,190 --> 00:47:19,659
like if that's your message the heat

1265
00:47:18,219 --> 00:47:22,778
you're gonna take for that it's gonna be

1266
00:47:19,659 --> 00:47:24,460
pretty minimal where is if you stand up

1267
00:47:22,778 --> 00:47:25,838
and do that in a prohibition area the

1268
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:29,909
heat you're gonna take for that can be

1269
00:47:25,838 --> 00:47:31,929
pretty intense for sure for sure alright

1270
00:47:29,909 --> 00:47:33,788
y'all make the YouTube videos better

1271
00:47:31,929 --> 00:47:36,159
I'll start putting more images in there

1272
00:47:33,789 --> 00:47:37,420
maybe I don't like recording my face and

1273
00:47:36,159 --> 00:47:38,889
doing the show like that I just really

1274
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:40,389
don't like doing it I've done a couple

1275
00:47:38,889 --> 00:47:41,889
maybe I'll do more of those it just

1276
00:47:40,389 --> 00:47:43,420
depends if if I get enough YouTube

1277
00:47:41,889 --> 00:47:44,288
interaction maybe you will start doing

1278
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:46,059
that

1279
00:47:44,289 --> 00:47:47,829
don't forget about patreon alright

across town is the a 64 over they

1387
00:51:44,269 --> 00:51:48,139
actually turned an old bar into a smoke

1388
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:49,340
Club so where there's a bar and people

1389
00:51:48,139 --> 00:51:51,079
are just sitting at the bar smoke and

1390
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:53,900
watching the game it was mostly just

1391
00:51:51,079 --> 00:51:55,429
dudes our age smoking a joint watching

1392
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:56,780
the game and like can I get another

1393
00:51:55,429 --> 00:51:58,429
pre-roll and the girl up there just

1394
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:59,570
passes in pre rolls and she's the

1395
00:51:58,429 --> 00:52:00,259
charges just like they're getting

1396
00:51:59,570 --> 00:52:01,640
another drink

1397
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:03,200

1398
00:52:01,639 --> 00:52:05,000
and dad's and watch the game people

1399
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:06,919
freak out about that concept but it's

1400
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:09,289
like we already have an infrastructure

1401
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:12,200
built for people to gather at a location

1402
00:52:09,289 --> 00:52:14,809
become intoxicated and have someone else

1403
00:52:12,199 --> 00:52:16,129
deliver them home like we [ __ ]

1404
00:52:14,809 --> 00:52:17,809
invented that shift for bars and

1405
00:52:16,130 --> 00:52:19,579
football games and literally every other

1406
00:52:17,809 --> 00:52:22,250
event adults gather in groups of more

1407
00:52:19,579 --> 00:52:23,630
than three like there's no reason we

1408
00:52:22,250 --> 00:52:25,340
can't do this with the weed other than

1409
00:52:23,630 --> 00:52:27,079
people we people are uptight about it

1410
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:28,760
people are scared you should hear the

1411
