267
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:58,600
on some rant and I'd just start zoning

268

out [ __ ] high as [ __ ] just like man

288
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:43,240
set up and everybody records their

289
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:45,560

come he would be on my show and he shook

291
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:50,599
my hand so if I make it to La podfest

292

anyway he said it so quietly [ __ ]

299
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:11,078
yeah um but he but Graham amazed me

300
00:10:09,078 --> 00:10:13,879
because he was funny and he was clean

301
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:16,159
which is hard to do so like uh just more

302
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:17,600
props to him he was really funny if if

303
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:19,838
he would ever listen to this I hope he

304
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,519
would hear us say that uh he was the

305
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:26,200
best part of that night because Doug

306
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:28,560
Benson came on after him and Doug first

307
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:30,160
thing he said he goes uh I woke up this

308
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:32,599
morning I started smoking this was on

309
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:34,519
420 yeah this was on 420 so let's yeah

310
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:36,879

311
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:40,278
he woke up he started smoking he did a

312
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:43,278
420 show up till he was he was smoking

313

up until then he just kept smoking all

314
00:10:43,278 --> 00:10:48,039
day and that was the first thing he said

315
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:50,000
is like he did all he could do to make

316
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:51,958
it to where he couldn't make it to that

317
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,360

some of the comedians Know Who I Am by

327
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:13,679
now because I've gone to enough shows so

328
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,000
he relies on rosta Jeff to get him high

329
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:17,078
before the show he knows I've got some

330
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,759
dank weed and I'm not psycho so he hits

331
00:11:17,078 --> 00:11:20,599
me up he hit me up to get him high one

332
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:22,159
time I got him high and he told me from

333
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:24,278
the stage he [ __ ] up a joke and looked

334
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:26,759
at me and said you got me too high bro

335
00:11:24,278 --> 00:11:29,159
yeah uh that night he was three or four

336
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:32,000
times beyond that level of highness he

337
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:34,240
was he was so [ __ ] skinny eyed

338
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,200
[ __ ] you could not see one eye was

339
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,560
skinny one eye was weird oh jeez I think

340
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:41,399
one eye was working kind of but it was

341
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:45,000
it was [ __ ] I I don't know dude he

342
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:47,600
was so baked that he

343
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,360
just he it just wasn't even that much

344
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,720
fun he kept putting his head on the

345
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,600
microphone you guys heard this sound a

346
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,759
lot and that was his head hitting the

347
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,360
microphone so that he could take a

348
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:56,759
little break he was I mean he was

349
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,959
laughing at his own jokes and there was

350
00:11:56,759 --> 00:12:00,399
some really hilarious [ __ ] that he said

351
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:02,439
he spent 30 minutes reading [ __ ]

352
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:04,078
tweets thank you the first 30 minutes of

353
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:05,880
his show he read tweets which he usually

354
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:07,759
spends but the problem was that 30

355
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:09,879
minutes was only divided up by like five

356
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:11,679
tweets yes it wasn't like a whole bunch

357
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:13,919
of tweets it was like five people that

358
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:16,838
were uh audacious enough to pull their

359
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:19,078
phone out in a comedy show and send him

360
00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:20,920
a shout out or and and tweet at him

361
00:12:19,078 --> 00:12:22,919
right then yeah that's we're up front

362
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:24,519
row I can't do that no that looks he

363
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:26,240
would Graham was staring at me cuz my

364
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:28,519
phone was on my lap because it's too big

365
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,919
for my pocket I got this iPhone 6 plus

366
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:31,639
my phone was on my lap and Graham kept

367
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:33,039
looking at it I felt like Graham Elwood

368
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:35,759
looked at my phone twice like he's got

369
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:37,039
his [ __ ] phone out but I maybe if it

370
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:38,519
was on your lap he was looking at

371
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:39,759

372
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:41,240
package bro you think Graham was

373
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:43,198

374
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:44,759

378
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:57,119
mic from his face and yawn on stage

379
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:59,278
performing his comedy special so he

380
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,000
actually said uh this is is my third

381
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:02,759
time recording this and what I want to

382
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,799
do is make sure to get the jokes that I

383
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:07,159
didn't get perfect the last couple of

384
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:08,519
times now now don't don't let me uh say

385
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:11,439
anything other than I respect him for

386
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:14,240
being honest but I just didn't pay to go

387
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,800
see a guy just kind of muddle through

388
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,519
something right do you know what I mean

389
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:19,359
yeah when I go to see a concert I don't

390
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,600
want to watch Metallica do soundcheck

391
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,199
five times I don't know why I picked

392
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:24,399
Metallica out of all [ __ ] band that

393
00:13:22,198 --> 00:13:26,759
would be well I mean

394
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:28,360
maybe I want to watch them nail inner

395
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:30,600
Sandman I don't want to watch them try

396
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:32,639
to do some song they haven't done right

397
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,320
in a couple of weeks we haven't we hav

398
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,959
played this song properly we're going to

399
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,879
try it in front of you like yeah three

400
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:39,879
times yeah or I mean Doug only did

401
00:13:37,879 --> 00:13:41,480
things I guess he did things three times

402
00:13:39,879 --> 00:13:43,879
that day though yeah and he did a couple

403
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:46,000
of the bits twice because he forgot he

404
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:47,720
did one when he was doing a bit for us

405
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,159
oh yeah well it's because he broke it

406
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:51,360
off early in the first part he didn't

407
00:13:49,159 --> 00:13:53,799
tell like the the same part of the story

408
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,800
did he I I don't remember how high were

409
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:59,000
we part of that was because he had a

410
00:13:56,799 --> 00:14:02,240
pocket full of notes that were

411
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,120
disheveled it looked like um it looked

412
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,519
like your grandpa had gone to Lowe's you

413
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:07,000
know when Grandpa comes home from going

414
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,799
out all day he's got a pocket full of

415
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,799
receipts and a couple of breath mints

416
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:14,120
and a [ __ ] toothpick and like did too

417
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:16,519
a shopping list and now Grandpa's got a

418
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:18,000
joint in there yeah yeah well he had

419
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:20,320
there's like four or five different

420
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,198
colors of pieces of paper in there there

421
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,320
was a receipt for Barnes &amp; Noble in

422
00:14:22,198 --> 00:14:26,359
there that I could see like he I don't

423
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,839
know if he had scribbled on all of it

424
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:30,600
but that's what that's where his notes

425
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:32,519
were was in that handful of Grandpa and

426
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,320
he kept staring at handful of Grandpa is

427
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:36,519

440
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:01,639
needs to be written down and I'm sorry

441

uh second of all um you know we're

445
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,440

446
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,000
much about growing not on this one but

447
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:16,440

448
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,440
people

449
00:15:17,198 --> 00:15:21,000
though all right now I now I remember

450
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,720
why I forget to bring comedians on the

451
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,399
show every so often it's just me bro

452
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,920
this is the [ __ ] that happens no I love

453
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:28,839
it I love the chaos I hope the listeners

454
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:30,318
like it uh it doesn't always have to be

455
00:15:28,839 --> 00:15:31,759
grow lessons Danielle you could put your

456
00:15:30,318 --> 00:15:33,559
notebook away there will be nothing to

457
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:36,680
write down this time other than the

458
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:40,119
phrase handful of Grandpa we

459
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:42,519
win anyway so but um so we had those

460
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:44,919
disheveled notes right and then that's

461
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:47,078
where we were there yeah and then uh he

462
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:48,318
just and I think he needs glasses to go

463
00:15:47,078 --> 00:15:50,039
with the notes oh dude he definitely

464
00:15:48,318 --> 00:15:52,559
needed to open his eyes a little bit

465
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:54,039
because they were [ __ ] closed yeah

466
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:55,599
yeah they were closed he was [ __ ] up

467
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:57,278
somebody threw a joint on stage and it

468
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,399
took him two minutes to find it and pick

469
00:15:57,278 --> 00:16:00,838
it up he almost stepped on it

470
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:02,919
he was wa and and if you've ever seen

471
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:04,600
The Comedy Works like stage it's well

472
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:07,799
lit and it's maybe the size of your

473
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:10,399
kitchen table yes like it's it's not a

474
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:12,519
big thing like by and there was nothing

475
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,078
on the stage it's like a blue carpet

476
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:15,720
what did somebody say the floor looked

477
00:16:14,078 --> 00:16:18,519
like somebody tweeted and said the floor

478
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:20,680
looked like a a nail or a salon floor a

479
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:22,120
spa a day spa floor I thought that was

480
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:25,039
weird but it was it was vacuumed

481
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:26,720
beautifully it was perfect anyway no but

482
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:29,360
it was just like 30 minutes on five

483
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,839
tweets which was kind of boring got into

484
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,360
some other stuff and then he tried to do

485
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:35,800
like other tweets or something like

486
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:38,879
later in the show didn't he wasn't he

487
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:40,958
doing tweet relief oh yeah uh he did a

488
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:42,278
thing it's called watch This Not That is

489
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:44,078
a game that he plays on his show where

490
00:16:42,278 --> 00:16:45,958
he lets the audience members select

491
00:16:44,078 --> 00:16:48,159
movies and then he decides which one to

492
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:49,719
watch but he was too high to keep track

493
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:52,039
of what the other audience members were

494
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:53,839
saying I Think Jesus I don't remember

495
00:16:52,039 --> 00:16:58,159
man well it was the thing's called

496
00:16:53,839 --> 00:17:01,600
promotional tool and uh we we definitely

497
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:04,199
felt like we got used like a tool like

498
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,959
it just it did it felt a little like uh

499
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:07,279
like you know what guys it sucks to be

500
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:09,000
you but this is what's happening and

501
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:12,119
maybe that's the way it has to be I

502
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,519
didn't want to say that when car when we

503
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:15,399
all were talking about it later I was

504
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:16,599
like so would you guys think and I was

505
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,360
just waiting for someone to be like that

506
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:20,519
was kind of [ __ ] whack for my 20

507
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:23,000
bucks well you went and hung out with

508
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:25,558
Doug and then me and uh my boy Drew took

509
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,919
off yeah we were all in stupidly enough

510
00:17:25,558 --> 00:17:29,319
there were three carloads of people from

511
00:17:26,919 --> 00:17:30,440
pleo with one or two people in each car

512
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:31,798
because we didn't plan that I had come

513
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,679
from the Cannabis Cup you came up on

514
00:17:31,798 --> 00:17:35,519
your own and then I invited Danielle

515
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:37,519
right after you left I was already in

516
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:39,038
Monument by the time she hit me up so

517
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:40,519
well she made it so I'm proud of her

518
00:17:39,038 --> 00:17:42,359
super proud she made that but yeah so we

519
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:44,000
all had to get in separate cars so once

520
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:45,879
we linked up and talked about it it was

521
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,919
like yeah I felt like we kind of were

522
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:49,919
his guinea pigs or his test audience or

523
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:52,200
something uh shout out to Graham Elwood

524
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:53,480
he saved the [ __ ] show uh Doug I'm

525
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,840
not being disrespectful to you bro I

526
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:58,079
just feel like that third show man you

527
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:59,639
were too high and if I wasn't I'm like a

528
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:01,599
loyal Doug fan so it was kind of neat

529
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,840
for me to see that like I've seen enough

530
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:04,759
Doug that's why I'm watching my friend

531
00:18:02,839 --> 00:18:06,959
do comedy Now whatever and I get VIP

532
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:09,400
seats and [ __ ] but if I was a normal

533
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,079
civilian listener I might not have been

534
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:13,000
impressed with that show well like I

535
00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:14,720
told you the only interaction I've had

536
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,400
with him is just listening to Doug Loves

537
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,079
movies and so that's not a whole lot of

538
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,880
Doug that's a lot of everybody else

539
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:21,759
right I haven't watched Doug specials

540
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:24,159
before that was my first chance of

541
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:25,919
seeing Doug Benson and I was not

542
00:18:24,159 --> 00:18:27,960
impressed I've said it on the podcast

543
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:30,400
before that I think maybe Doug's uh

544
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:32,319
excess cannabis use may be slowing down

545
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,960
his comedy and his career and I think

546
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:37,319
that our experience uh solidifies my

547
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:39,120
theory yeah yeah and that sucks because

548
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:41,000
cannabis shouldn't be used as a slowing

549
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:43,678
down it should be used as a way to move

550
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,359
yourself forward well and then um real

551
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:47,679
quick and and we didn't bring this up

552
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:49,158
before but when when there was that he

553
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,360
said we're all going to go smoke outside

554
00:18:49,159 --> 00:18:52,480
and I was like all right cool so we'll

555
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:54,639
go smoke and there was what like 100

556
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,079
people L there was like 100 people in

557
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,799
that Alleyway I don't know if you guys

558
00:18:56,079 --> 00:19:00,558
have ever seen The Comedy Works Alleyway

559
00:18:57,798 --> 00:19:02,440
but it's proba probably 30 ft wide maybe

560
00:19:00,558 --> 00:19:04,119
you know about 10 yards well I'm just

561
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,759
trying to give it a little bit of room

562
00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:06,678
because car and a person on either side

563
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:08,640
of the car you know I'm going to say

564
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:10,200
it's 10t wide I feel it well I don't

565
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,880
know if a car goes down there we all got

566
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:15,360
to squeeze against the side yeah I guess

567
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,039
all right so so we'll say 10t wide yeah

568
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:18,798
maybe 15 just but there was there was

569
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:21,879
like 75 to 100 people there A lot of

570
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:24,798
people in there um and and it started

571
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:26,960
feeling real broy while while Doug was

572
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:29,158
smoking Doug could take a hit of a joint

573
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:31,360
and everybody would cheer for it as

574
00:19:29,159 --> 00:19:33,760
though he was like some hero like coming

575
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:36,678
home from war and this was his first

576
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:39,200
like step on American soil it was

577
00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:41,159
[ __ ] it was just like yeah that's

578
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,038
that's it like we we're doing it we're

579
00:19:41,159 --> 00:19:45,280
outside in Colorado we're doing it and

580
00:19:43,038 --> 00:19:48,038
it was just like no this is this isn't

581
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:49,678
the attitude I want to have around weed

582
00:19:48,038 --> 00:19:51,119
yeah yeah it kind of wasn't it seemed uh

583
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,480
like we were taking tequila shots and

584
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:54,719
everybody was high-fiving over the

585
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,519
tequila shots yeah it got that way yeah

586
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,000
that's how I felt about it I'm glad that

587
00:19:56,519 --> 00:20:00,158
I didn't I I didn't stick around I had

588
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,720
to get home I was tired actually Doug

589
00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:03,760
usually hangs out and smokes with

590
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:05,079
everybody but he uh he smoked with a few

591
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:06,400
people and then he knows me so he

592
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:08,038

600
00:20:18,519 --> 00:20:21,918

of you guys some of you guys may like it

647
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:05,759
uh Clint I could tell that uh Clint was

648
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:08,319
a little bit lost during the show yeah

649
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:10,720
it was either lost or it was

650
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:12,399
just I don't know he gets a little ranty

651
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,720
you know how it is well yeah that's he

652
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,798
calls that the boring preachy part of

653
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:17,319
his show he definitely he he sure has

654
00:22:15,798 --> 00:22:19,240
that's a good portion of his show

655
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:21,079
apparently Cu uh there was a lot of

656
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:22,400
preachy Parts there was some joke Parts

657
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:24,158
at the start they just take a little

658
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,240
while he's got like a lot of references

659
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:28,278
and stuff that just it just takes a

660
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,720
while to get to things I'm more of a you

661
00:22:28,278 --> 00:22:31,839
know let me hit you with the left and a

662
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:33,839
right like well his comedy he's he's

663
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:35,319
doing uh no he's a smart guy and I like

664
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:36,959
the guy and he's funny like some of the

665
00:22:35,319 --> 00:22:38,319
jokes he had were really funny it just

666
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,880
takes a little while to get there but

667
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:43,000
he's I'm pretty sure he's like improving

668
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,840
all of that all of that was improv

669
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,960
Wednesday was the Podcast Thursday

670
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:48,599
Friday and Saturday he's doing standup

671
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,278
which will be completely different than

672
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:52,119
what you saw that's the thing is like

673
00:22:50,278 --> 00:22:55,200
improv is a different thing to me you

674
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:56,959
know what I mean like uh I do standup I

675
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,480
don't do improv and it's nothing against

676
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:01,360
improv I just don't do Do It um so I

677
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:04,278
don't know those skills like those guys

678
00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:05,719
are better uh at many many things but I

679
00:23:04,278 --> 00:23:07,679
think just getting to the joke and

680
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:10,558
keeping people laughing that's where

681
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:13,240
standup Reigns and keeping you engaged

682
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:14,918
and stuff like that now improv is kind

683
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:17,120
of like well let let's try to figure out

684
00:23:14,919 --> 00:23:18,679
how do we get back to this like neutral

685
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:20,959
points or whatever so that way we can

686
00:23:18,679 --> 00:23:22,960
make it funny and but those guys that's

687
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:25,038
a challenge and a half but the audience

688
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,919
is a little bit more uh gives you more

689
00:23:25,038 --> 00:23:28,558
leeway with that oh yeah you know what I

690
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:30,600
mean so maybe you guys knowing the

691
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:33,240
podcast were giving him more leeway than

692
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:35,918
I was well I am I'm not there just for

693
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:38,079
the funny I'm expecting to be um

694
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:40,960
enlightened a little by Greg educated

695
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:43,119
slightly offended at some points um I

696
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,640
know he's a thinking man's comedian you

697
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:46,719
have to and he calls himself the world's

698
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,960
smartest man it's not it's that's a joke

699
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,400
that's just a but it's he's a smart dude

700
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,120
though he's a smart sucker and he's been

701
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,600
doing improv we you asked him how long

702
00:23:52,119 --> 00:23:54,879
you've been doing comedy and he just

703
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:56,519
shook his head at you like I think he

704
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,080
just wanted to say like longer than

705
00:23:56,519 --> 00:24:00,759
you've been alive and that but I was but

706
00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:02,278
but and and I wasn't trying to say it

707
00:24:00,759 --> 00:24:03,960
like oh how long you been I I was just

708
00:24:02,278 --> 00:24:05,839
wanting to ask him like well how long

709
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:08,679
you know this this is like a goal of

710
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:10,399
mine to be you and and he kind of did

711
00:24:08,679 --> 00:24:12,120
kind of just dismiss me as though I was

712
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,880
saying it like an [ __ ] but what I

713
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:16,839
meant like was all respect like dude

714
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,679
like I just I just want to know that

715
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:20,759
there is the possibility that in like

716
00:24:18,679 --> 00:24:22,440
you've been doing this for 30 years

717
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:24,640
that's what it takes to get to you cool

718
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:26,159
man I'd love to yeah he's that's where I

719
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,000
want to be and you guys he's the one

720
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:29,559
from Whose Line Is It Anyway is name of

721
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,159
the show right Who's Line yeah Whose

722
00:24:29,558 --> 00:24:33,278
Line Is It Anyways one of the that's one

723
00:24:31,159 --> 00:24:34,960
of the shows that this guy is on he's uh

724
00:24:33,278 --> 00:24:37,440
no offense to Greg but he's probably the

725
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,759
one that you call the gay one yeah he's

726
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,360
not he's got a beautiful wife named

727
00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:42,000
Jennifer and he is completely straight

728
00:24:40,359 --> 00:24:44,199
and he stands up for women's rights so

729
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,519
he just got like a little bit of a high

730
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:48,519
uh irritating voice you know what I mean

731
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:50,079
like I don't mean like super irritating

732
00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:52,519
but it's just like I probably wouldn't

733
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:54,079
want to marry that guy well I'm glad you

734
00:24:52,519 --> 00:24:55,639
feel that way I think I think I'm all

735
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:56,918
right with that his voice made it to

736
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:59,320
where I didn't want to marry him nothing

737
00:24:56,919 --> 00:25:01,679
else about that situation uh he wears a

738
00:24:59,319 --> 00:25:04,480
suit all of the time uh he had a suit

739
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:06,600
with an uh kind of an uh it's a bluish

740
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,919
jacket with a purple shirt underneath it

741
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:10,558
and he had a purple hanky in one pocket

742
00:25:08,919 --> 00:25:12,919
and at one point he pulled out a hanky

743
00:25:10,558 --> 00:25:15,240
out of his jacket pocket to do a joke

744
00:25:12,919 --> 00:25:17,640
and the hanky out of his pocket was

745
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:20,079
perfectly pressed and it was purple and

746
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:22,840
it had gold pinstriping on it dude his

747
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:25,079
pocket hanky was [ __ ] stylish like

748
00:25:22,839 --> 00:25:27,319
this dude is stylish from head to toe

749
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:30,119
his shoes were sharp the only thing that

750
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:31,759
shocked me about the man was uh so we

751
00:25:30,119 --> 00:25:33,038
saw the com we saw him record his show

752
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:34,599
while he's recording the show I look to

753
00:25:33,038 --> 00:25:36,798
the right and I see Ango sitting

754
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:38,038
backstage at Comedy Works so I was like

755

758
00:25:44,278 --> 00:25:46,798
times of me looking over at Clinton he's

759
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:48,120

761

763
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,200
sorry about that Joe joined us for the

764
00:25:52,599 --> 00:25:56,959
comedy show Joe had a great time Joe was

765
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:58,880
a huge poops fan so uh I looked over and

766
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,720
Greg's kind of uh Clint's kind of fallen

767
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,520
asleep a couple of times and then after

768
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,759
the show we're looking for the guys and

769
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:04,879
we can't find them and a friend of mine

770
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:07,119
is like dude they're down here in this

771
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,480
area smoking just walk back there and I

772
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:09,759
walk back there and I could hear Ango

773
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,759
from a block away he's got a very

774
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:12,960
recognizable voice so we walk down the

775
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:15,960
stairs and they're just hanging out

776
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:18,480
smoking so uh and guo greets me and knew

777
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:20,200
my name and then I introduce myself to

778
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,720
Greg PRS he sticks out his hand we shake

779
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:24,558
hands I asked if we're interrupting they

780
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:26,440
said no I lit a joint yep that's just

781
00:26:24,558 --> 00:26:27,678
what I felt like needed to happen so

782
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:30,080
then we started hanging out with the

783
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:31,200
these guys for we hung out for an hour

784
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:32,798
yeah about an hour one of the things I

785
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,480
was going to say what I led on to was

786
00:26:32,798 --> 00:26:36,720
the thing that shocked me about Greg he

787
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,798
smokes cigarettes I never would have

788
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,919
guessed Greg PRS smoked cigarettes I

789
00:26:38,798 --> 00:26:41,359
don't know why you would have thought

790
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:43,080
that he was smarter than that is that

791
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:44,879
what you're saying I think so yes

792
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:47,439
nothing against you cigarette smokers I

793
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:50,360
know cuz I I've just recently finally

794
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:52,000
got I I quit my EIG too nice I quit all

795
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:54,398
that nicotine [ __ ] very cool I'm just

796
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,200
doing weed now which you know hit and

797
00:26:54,398 --> 00:26:57,879
miss that's that's a good thing or a bad

798
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:59,278
thing you know no that's better for you

799
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:01,480

the time he had pulled that out I smelt

817
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:41,480
it though I think my platinum OG uh

818
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:43,159

had with me and he looked quite

821
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,640
impressed with it he was uh he and he

822
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:50,200
was a nice guy too so and gu's a great

823
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,000
dude that is true we smoked with these

824
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:54,840
guys for like an hour and they were

825
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,200
talking to us not at us not about us

826
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:57,879
like we were just hanging out with

827
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:59,880
normal people at one point Point Greg

828
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:01,360
proops was telling a baseball story go

829
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:03,559
figure if you know anything about PRS

830
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:06,879
you know he's a huge baseball fan and he

831
00:28:03,558 --> 00:28:09,798
was talking about a uh player leading

832
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:12,440
off of first BL base in a celebration

833
00:28:09,798 --> 00:28:14,359
and then the Umpire yelled play ball and

834
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:16,120
the guy just stayed way off of first BL

835
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:18,798
base and so the first baseman reaches

836
00:28:16,119 --> 00:28:21,639
over with the ball and tags him out and

837
00:28:18,798 --> 00:28:23,720
as he talks about tagging him out he Dam

838
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:25,480
near punched me in the titty yeah did

839
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:27,640
like because he tagged me out as like a

840
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:29,360
physical act to show what happened but

841
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:32,038
he was being cool no he was just hanging

842
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:34,479
out and that story was uh the the Kansas

843
00:28:32,038 --> 00:28:36,640
City Royals own George Brett for all the

844
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,519
uh Stoner [ __ ] baseball that was the

845
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,559
story you were that we were being told

846
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:41,759

847
00:28:40,558 --> 00:28:43,599
yeah that's exactly it is he was

848
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:46,278
celebrating his 3,000th hit but so when

849
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:48,439
PRS was acting out the smack he smacked

850
00:28:46,278 --> 00:28:49,798
me and looked at me like I was his buddy

851
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:51,840
and I tried not to light up like a

853

00:37:45,719 --> 00:37:49,039

I'm pretty sure you guys are getting a

1116
00:37:49,039 --> 00:37:53,239
lot of weed anyway and if you made it

1117

this far good job yeah yeah um make sure

1118
00:37:53,239 --> 00:37:57,000
you clean the filters and your air

1119
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:58,720
conditioners and calibrate your PA H

1120
