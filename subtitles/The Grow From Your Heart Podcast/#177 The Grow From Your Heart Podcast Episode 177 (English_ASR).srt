Hispanic folks I felt like it maybe a

98
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:21,459
bit racist calling about calling out the

99
00:03:18,819 --> 00:03:22,629
folks of Latin descent for liking Sour

100
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:25,239
Diesel but I felt that was something

101
00:03:22,629 --> 00:03:27,370
that I noticed and my friend Mountain

102
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:29,950

Instagram follow him if he wants you

153
00:05:06,829 --> 00:05:11,120
alright let's talk a little bit about

154
00:05:08,629 --> 00:05:12,949
your powdery mildew situation there are

155
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,288
a lot of things we can spray and things

156
00:05:12,949 --> 00:05:17,210
we can do to help treat and correct this

157
00:05:15,288 --> 00:05:19,129
problem but what I'm mainly concerned

158
00:05:17,209 --> 00:05:20,839
with is why is it there how did it show

159
00:05:19,129 --> 00:05:23,658
up in the first place and is it going to

160
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:25,939
come back since you say you've sprayed

161
00:05:23,658 --> 00:05:27,800
[ __ ] everything it makes me think

162
00:05:25,939 --> 00:05:29,689
that you have issues with the room

163
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,490
obviously there is not enough airflow

164
00:05:29,689 --> 00:05:33,490
you're not getting rid of the old air

165
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:35,269
you're not bringing in enough fresh air

166
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:37,400
possibly there are temperature

167
00:05:35,269 --> 00:05:39,348
fluctuations there are a lot of things

168
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:41,388
like that that are going to be causing

169
00:05:39,348 --> 00:05:43,848
problems are you running a hydro grow or

170
00:05:41,389 --> 00:05:45,228
a soil grow if it's hydro you've got a

171
00:05:43,848 --> 00:05:47,839
lot of water in there you're gonna have

172
00:05:45,228 --> 00:05:49,610
to control the temperature if it's hydro

173
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:51,138
you may need to get some chillers and

174
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:53,330
cool the water because that'll prevent

175
00:05:51,139 --> 00:05:55,370
the water from becoming a vapor which

176
00:05:53,329 --> 00:05:57,769
becomes humidity which promotes the

177
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:59,389
powdery mildew if you're running with

178
00:05:57,769 --> 00:06:01,008
rock wool cubes you may need to let them

179
00:05:59,389 --> 00:06:03,379
dry a little more if you're running soil

180
00:06:01,009 --> 00:06:05,509
you may be getting the soil too wet how

181
00:06:03,379 --> 00:06:07,879
much water is in the grow facility

182
00:06:05,509 --> 00:06:09,710
itself do you have water available to

183
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:11,478
evaporate to make condensation in there

184
00:06:09,709 --> 00:06:14,000
that's gonna help you get powdery mildew

185
00:06:11,478 --> 00:06:15,319
too much moisture too much water you

186
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,240
said you're in the desert so too much

187
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:18,800
moisture too much water the outside is

188
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:20,360
hot the inside is real moisture creating

189
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,098
a bubble filled with humidity in there

190
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:24,139
and that's going to contribute to your

191
00:06:22,098 --> 00:06:26,060
powdery mildew so you need heavy

192
00:06:24,139 --> 00:06:28,490
dehumidification in that room you need

193
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:30,110
to get that old hot stale air out you

194
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:32,478
need to get some fresh air in you need

195
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:34,158
some ventilation hopefully you're

196
00:06:32,478 --> 00:06:35,899
treating the air that's coming in that's

197
00:06:34,158 --> 00:06:37,879
something we should talk about you need

198
00:06:35,899 --> 00:06:40,370
to get that old stale air out stale air

199
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:42,800
out of course but there's fresh air

200
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:44,750
coming in that fresh air coming in

201
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:48,470
need to be treated you need a filter and

202
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:50,300
also they make a UV light that is very

203
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:52,879
good at killing powdery mildew it will

204
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:55,520
kill any spores that come in they make a

205
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:57,650
light that goes over your ducting so the

206
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:58,848
ducting the intake ducting comes in and

207
00:06:57,649 --> 00:07:00,649
then this light shines through the

208
00:06:58,848 --> 00:07:03,378
ducting and everything that passes

209
00:07:00,649 --> 00:07:05,299
through that duct is basically killed so

210
00:07:03,379 --> 00:07:08,599
I would use HIPPA filters on all of the

211
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:11,629
intakes and I would use the UV lighting

212
00:07:08,598 --> 00:07:13,098
on all of the venting and ducting if you

213
00:07:11,629 --> 00:07:14,539
can if you can pass all of the air

214
00:07:13,098 --> 00:07:16,848
through one thing and run a UV light

215
00:07:14,538 --> 00:07:18,769
over it that would be ideal they sell

216
00:07:16,848 --> 00:07:20,120
things called clean lights they're UV

217
00:07:18,769 --> 00:07:21,589
lights that are designed for gardens

218
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,449
they're mostly used in like this

219
00:07:21,589 --> 00:07:25,908
strawberry industry because strawberries

220
00:07:23,449 --> 00:07:27,620
get a lot of powdery mildew on them they

221
00:07:25,908 --> 00:07:28,939
sell handheld versions of these lights

222
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:30,978
that you can actually walk around the

223
00:07:28,939 --> 00:07:32,870
crop and shine this light over the

224
00:07:30,978 --> 00:07:35,360
entire crop and you just run it over I

225
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:37,728
just basically want to illuminate every

226
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,288
inch of the canopy for about a half a

227
00:07:37,728 --> 00:07:40,519
second to two seconds so you just wave

228
00:07:39,288 --> 00:07:41,870
your hand waving my hand over it right

229
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:43,519
now like you guys can see what I'm doing

230
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:44,629
but it's basically the same motion you

231
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:46,008
make when you're watering you know you

232
00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:47,419
just move your hand around bla bla bla

233
00:07:46,009 --> 00:07:49,340
back and forth like a windshield wiper

234
00:07:47,418 --> 00:07:51,049
you do that with this light and you walk

235
00:07:49,339 --> 00:07:53,239
over the canopy and just make sure that

236
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:55,759
the light shines on every leaf and that

237
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:57,439
light kills the powdery mildew it takes

238
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,819
several applications of that light to

239
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:00,500
get rid of powdery mildew if you already

240
00:07:58,819 --> 00:08:03,319
have it but if you're persistent with it

241
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:05,778
that will help so the room needs to be

242
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:07,639
corrected there may be some water issues

243
00:08:05,778 --> 00:08:09,528
you may need some equipment some

244
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:11,960
dehumidification you need some air

245
00:08:09,528 --> 00:08:13,968
exchange temperature control is huge you

246
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:15,649
can't have huge swings huge temperature

247
00:08:13,968 --> 00:08:18,500
swings in the night and in the day are

248
00:08:15,649 --> 00:08:20,418
going to cause powdery mildew issues so

249
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:23,000
that's what I think about the room let's

250
00:08:20,418 --> 00:08:24,918
talk about the plants how far apart are

251
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,418
your plants are they touching if the

252
00:08:24,918 --> 00:08:29,478
plant leaves are laying on top of each

253
00:08:26,418 --> 00:08:30,799
other in that little space imagine if if

254
00:08:29,478 --> 00:08:33,500
we're sitting in a room and I just put

255
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,820
my hand on this sounds disgusting to me

256
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:37,668
but what if I just put my head on your

257
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:39,560
leg in my hot hand I'm 96 degrees or

258
00:08:37,668 --> 00:08:41,538
whatever I am my head is just sitting on

259
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:43,189
your leg in about 20 or 30 minutes

260
00:08:41,538 --> 00:08:45,139
there's gonna be a hot sweaty spot there

261
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:46,490
just from our body parts touching and

262
00:08:45,139 --> 00:08:48,259
getting warm there's gonna be a little

263
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:50,329
bit of sweat in there that's sweat that

264
00:08:48,259 --> 00:08:51,799
those plants create will cause powdery

265
00:08:50,328 --> 00:08:53,328
mildew right there between those two

266
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:56,088
leaves and it'll start spreading from

267
00:08:53,328 --> 00:08:56,719
there rapidly so something you can

268
00:08:56,089 --> 00:08:59,900
really help

269
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:03,500
d foliate heavily when i'm in a large

270
00:08:59,899 --> 00:09:05,000
commercial facility we spend days just

271
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:07,429
defoliating sometimes it'll be

272
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,539
defoliation day guys get super stoned on

273
00:09:07,429 --> 00:09:10,129
your break because when you come back

274
00:09:08,539 --> 00:09:11,659
all you're doing is pulling leaves for

275
00:09:10,129 --> 00:09:13,610
the next eight hours just pluck every

276
00:09:11,659 --> 00:09:15,529
leaf with the PDL out of that room if

277
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:16,820
you're I'm not sure if you're the

278
00:09:15,529 --> 00:09:19,399
manager if you're the boss or if you're

279
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:21,230
the owner but if you were able to pull

280
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:22,370
every leaf that you can out of there

281
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:24,850
those leaves are where the powdery

282
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:26,570
mildew happens get it out of there so

283
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:29,029
that's what you can do for the plant

284
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:31,280
spread them out kind of take off all the

285
00:09:29,029 --> 00:09:32,720
big leaves put some air on them fan them

286
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,399
around if the powdery mildew can't

287
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,990
develop because it's blown around too

288
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,209
much it can't develop if the humidity

289
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:40,700
doesn't stay stagnant the powdery mildew

290
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:42,259
will have a harder time developing so

291
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:44,900
let's talk about you said you've sprayed

292
00:09:42,259 --> 00:09:47,000
everything I've hit your plants look

293
00:09:44,899 --> 00:09:48,319
pissed off they got powdery mildew and

294
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,460
you're spraying them with stuff and

295
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,570
they're trying to fight the powdery

296
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:51,920
mildew and then they're getting [ __ ]

297
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:52,790
sprayed on them frequently but they're

298
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:54,379
getting mad I bet you're getting

299
00:09:52,789 --> 00:09:56,539
frustrated as hell

300
00:09:54,379 --> 00:09:59,000
stay positive bro we're going to beat

301
00:09:56,539 --> 00:10:00,709
this [ __ ] um I'm curious what you've

302
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,990
sprayed because sometimes your sprays

303
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:04,879
are going to add more moisture it's

304
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:06,320
gonna add more humidity I've sprayed

305
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:07,669
commercial rooms thinking yeah I just

306
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,110
got rid of powdery mildew when I came

307
00:10:07,669 --> 00:10:11,029
back the next day and the powdery mildew

308
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:11,360
was actually thicker drove me [ __ ]

309
00:10:11,029 --> 00:10:12,889
nuts

310
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,480
so like I'm saying you got to fix the

311
00:10:12,889 --> 00:10:16,250
room you have to spread the plants apart

312
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,409
if you've got a bunch of water on the

313
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:20,029
floor squeegee and shop-vac that [ __ ] up

314
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:22,009
get rid of that extra water so let's

315
00:10:20,029 --> 00:10:24,949
talk about sprays what have you sprayed

316
00:10:22,009 --> 00:10:28,039
I'm really curious um there is a product

317
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:30,230
called big-time exterminator that I have

318
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:33,169
heard works wonders on powdery mildew

319
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:34,580
it's organic and it is okay here's

320
00:10:33,169 --> 00:10:36,559
something I should mention in Colorado

321
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:38,660
we are very limited on products that we

322
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:40,369
can use a lot of people will say go get

323
00:10:38,659 --> 00:10:42,709
a bottle of Eagle 20 and spray that [ __ ]

324
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:44,810
right on your plants Eagle 20 will get

325
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:46,370
rid of your powdery mildew it may take

326
00:10:44,809 --> 00:10:47,959
one application it may take two

327
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:51,110
applications but your powdery mildew

328
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:53,839
will be gone for 30 days maybe 45 to 60

329
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:55,970
days guaranteed I personally do not like

330
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:58,550
Eagle 20 there are a lot of deadly

331
00:10:55,970 --> 00:11:01,220
dangerous shitty chemicals in there that

332
00:10:58,549 --> 00:11:02,809
we do not need to spray on our plants

333
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:04,910
that we are going to call medicine to

334
00:11:02,809 --> 00:11:07,939
give to sick people I do not recommend

335
00:11:04,909 --> 00:11:09,919
eagle 20 in Colorado Eagle 20 is

336
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:10,550
completely banned we are not allowed to

337
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,469
use it and

338
00:11:10,549 --> 00:11:14,240
recreational or a medical facility that

339
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:16,759
is regulated by the Colorado marijuana

340
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,950
Enforcement Division is a banned product

341
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:21,169
I like that some products are banned it

342
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:23,959
keeps us safe it keeps our growers safe

343
00:11:21,169 --> 00:11:25,250
it keeps the consumers safe we haven't

344
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:26,750
done enough research on a lot of these

345
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:29,360
chemicals to know what's going to happen

346
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:31,328
to us if we smoke it and a lot of these

347
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,860
things affect your body in a way that

348
00:11:31,328 --> 00:11:36,049
say I spray my plants with eagle 20

349
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:37,310
today and we let them flower we harvest

350
00:11:36,049 --> 00:11:39,919
them we cut them down that's probably

351
00:11:37,309 --> 00:11:42,409
you know 50 to 60 days you let them dry

352
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:44,750
you smoke it there's probably still

353
00:11:42,409 --> 00:11:46,278
Eagle 20 on those buds when I smoke it I

354
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,778
don't think I'm gonna notice anything

355
00:11:46,278 --> 00:11:49,789
right away I may get a funky taste my

356
00:11:47,778 --> 00:11:51,620
throat may burn but that's it but I'm

357
00:11:49,789 --> 00:11:53,028
thinking that in like ten years is what

358
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:54,860
I'm gonna notice the [ __ ] up from that

359
00:11:53,028 --> 00:11:57,049
I'm gonna get a twitch my left eye is

360
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:59,240
gonna pop out I'm gonna talk funny I

361
00:11:57,049 --> 00:12:01,549
might get a limp or even a bigger fear

362
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:04,339
maybe it does something to my DNA or my

363
00:12:01,549 --> 00:12:05,809
RNA and my I'm not I don't plan on

364
00:12:04,339 --> 00:12:07,579
having any more kids but maybe you do

365
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:08,989
maybe it'll [ __ ] up your RNA and your

366
00:12:07,578 --> 00:12:11,719
DNA and your kids will come out with

367
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:14,870
three arms or three eyes or one foot or

368
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:16,430
14 toes you know so we don't know enough

369
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:18,649
about what these these chemicals kill

370
00:12:16,429 --> 00:12:21,049
mildews and they kill bugs so it's doing

371
00:12:18,649 --> 00:12:22,070
something biologically or something it

372
00:12:21,049 --> 00:12:23,208
depends on what kind of chemical you're

373
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:24,440
using but it's doing something and it

374
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:26,269
could be getting into your body and

375
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:28,339
[ __ ] up your body by smoking it so we

376
00:12:26,269 --> 00:12:30,110
need to be really careful I know I got

377
00:12:28,339 --> 00:12:32,360
way off topic just kind of want to rant

378
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:34,009
there but if you want a spray eagle 20

379
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:35,539
go in there hit that shoot with eagle 20

380
00:12:34,009 --> 00:12:37,009
problem solved you got a little bit of

381
00:12:35,539 --> 00:12:38,389
time to figure out how to fix the rooms

382
00:12:37,009 --> 00:12:39,980
and then hopefully you can fix it again

383
00:12:38,389 --> 00:12:41,870
and not ever have to use the Eagle 20

384
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:44,570
again I don't recommend that [ __ ] you

385
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:46,759
guys at all at all at all things that we

386
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:48,740
are allowed to use in Colorado a product

387
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:51,470
called big-time exterminator it's mostly

388
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:52,820
citrus oil or citrus it's citrus

389
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:55,278
something I think a citrus oil mostly

390
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:57,140
citrus oil extract it sounds like smells

391
00:12:55,278 --> 00:12:59,179
like oranges it's kind of nice like

392
00:12:57,139 --> 00:13:02,149
lemony smell orange II smell citrusy

393
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:05,328
smell to it I mixed that up I think I

394
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:07,220
put I did whatever the bucket says

395
00:13:05,328 --> 00:13:08,689
there's an ingredients on the bucket go

396
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:11,089
the heavy route mix it up with some

397
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:14,060
water spray that right on the plants and

398
00:13:11,089 --> 00:13:15,709
that stuff should calm down the powdery

399
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:17,448
mildew you may have to go for a few

400
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:19,729
applications of that that'll take care

401
00:13:17,448 --> 00:13:22,519
of your powdery mildew another product

402
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:24,070
that I have seen work on powdery mildew

403
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:29,019
is

404
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:31,510
30% hydrogen peroxide I saw a guy put 50

405
00:13:29,019 --> 00:13:33,250
milliliters of hydrogen peroxide in a

406
00:13:31,509 --> 00:13:36,069
five-gallon bucket and sprayed that

407
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:38,110
directly he adjusted the pH and then

408
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:40,030
sprayed that directly on to the entire

409
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:42,220
crop and you could kind of see the

410
00:13:40,029 --> 00:13:45,220
hydrogen peroxide breakdown the powdery

411
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:46,540
mildew she sprayed the entire crop and

412
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:48,850
then he went ahead and sprayed the

413
00:13:46,539 --> 00:13:50,319
entire room sprayed everything down

414
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:52,060
everything smelled like hydrogen

415
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,790
peroxide it smelled super clean in there

416
00:13:52,059 --> 00:13:56,679
it took several applications I think he

417
00:13:54,789 --> 00:13:58,870
was going at it daily but by the end of

418
00:13:56,679 --> 00:14:00,609
a week the powdery mildew was gone so

419
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:03,100
you can use p.m. wash you can use

420
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:04,629
hydrogen peroxide you can use oh sorry I

421
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:06,879
didn't say p.m. wash there's a product

422
00:14:04,629 --> 00:14:08,259
called PM wash which I haven't used it

423
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:10,960
but I've read great things about it the

424
00:14:08,259 --> 00:14:14,289
PM wash should wash the powdery mildew

425
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:16,180
off of your plants so peroxide PM wash

426
00:14:14,289 --> 00:14:17,949
and Big Time exterminator are three

427
00:14:16,179 --> 00:14:19,359
products that you can buy you can order

428
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:21,190
them over the internet you could

429
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:24,550
probably buy them at your local grocers

430
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:26,680
those products I'm told will get rid of

431
00:14:24,549 --> 00:14:28,389
your powdery mildew I have seen the

432
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:29,859
hydrogen peroxide do it I've seen the

433
00:14:28,389 --> 00:14:31,419
big-time exterminator do it it'll take

434
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:33,460
multiple applications you have to be

435
00:14:31,419 --> 00:14:34,629
persistent you have to pay attention to

436
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:36,550
the plants they're gonna need a little

437
00:14:34,629 --> 00:14:38,230
bit of love after this if you're gonna

438
00:14:36,549 --> 00:14:39,789
spray them for several days with the

439
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:40,870
products like big-time exterminator or

440
00:14:39,789 --> 00:14:42,849
hydrogen peroxide

441
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:44,620
I recommend give them a day of rest and

442
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:46,930
then spray them with push from our

443
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:48,700
friends at veg bloom they do not pay me

444
00:14:46,929 --> 00:14:50,829
to talk about their products but push is

445
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:52,090
an amazing product it's a foliar product

446
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:54,400
it's a little hard to get it's a little

447
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:55,899
bit expensive but oh my god it's worth

448
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:57,699
every penny and if you're gonna do this

449
00:14:55,899 --> 00:14:59,319
much damage and this much beating up to

450
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:01,390
your plants I think push would be really

451
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:04,300
helpful another product I can recommend

452
00:15:01,389 --> 00:15:06,039
is a product called stylet oil silent

453
00:15:04,299 --> 00:15:08,229
oil is not allowed to be used in a

454
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:10,389
recreational or commercial facility in

455
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:12,730
Colorado but I have used it myself and

456
00:15:10,389 --> 00:15:15,309
it did take care of everything

457
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:17,710
stylet oil is an oil that coats your

458
00:15:15,309 --> 00:15:19,869
plant and it will not allow the powdery

459
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:21,759
mildew to grow on the plant it will not

460
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:23,289
allow fungus gnats to gather on the

461
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:25,059
plant it won't let mites get on the

462
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:26,589
bottom side of the plant nothing wants

463
00:15:25,059 --> 00:15:28,329
anything to do with styling oil

464
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:30,430
the problem with styling oil is it

465
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:31,600
strips the cuticles off your plant

466
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,799
leaves and it leaves them really

467
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,259
vulnerable and they look a little

468
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:37,329
leathery they get kind of sad at you

469
00:15:35,259 --> 00:15:37,778
about it if you're going to use styling

470
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:39,999
oil

471
00:15:37,778 --> 00:15:43,088
I would if your plants are small enough

472
00:15:39,999 --> 00:15:44,800
I would dunk the plants into a stylet

473
00:15:43,089 --> 00:15:46,480
oil diluted heavily don't go straight

474
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:48,159
into the oil sorry let me say that mix

475
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,959
up some style of oil I cannot think of

476
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:52,629
the dilution recommendations but it is

477
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:55,359
on the bottle go light dunk the plant

478
00:15:52,629 --> 00:15:57,039
into the stylet oil get every leaf in

479
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,649
there give it a good wiggle pull it out

480
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:01,568
set it back in the grow area turn off

481
00:15:59,649 --> 00:16:03,339
the lights let it dry give it about an

482
00:16:01,568 --> 00:16:04,808
hour let all the plants dry after you've

483
00:16:03,339 --> 00:16:06,730
dunked everything and then go back with

484
00:16:04,808 --> 00:16:09,399
the sprayer and hose off every single

485
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:10,539
plant the stylet oil will dry and coat

486
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:13,149
and then you just want to kind of rinse

487
00:16:10,539 --> 00:16:15,730
off the excess and all of your powdery

488
00:16:13,149 --> 00:16:17,828
mildew and bugs should be removed within

489
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:19,180
the first application styling oil will

490
00:16:17,828 --> 00:16:20,739
[ __ ] your plants up if they're not

491
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:22,508
strong it's gonna beat the [ __ ] out of

492
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:24,519
them maybe test a couple of plants

493
00:16:22,509 --> 00:16:27,759
because it does beat your plants up

494
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:29,350
heavily but it will work I had almost

495
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,999
forgotten about the stylet oil where are

496
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:33,370
you located man I've got a huge bottle

497
00:16:30,999 --> 00:16:35,680
of JMS silent oil that I do not think

498
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:37,749
I'm going to use if you're near me we

499
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:38,679
can work out a deal just [ __ ] I want

500
00:16:37,749 --> 00:16:40,930
to see what happens when you use it

501
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:43,599
let's see where am I now another thing

502
00:16:40,929 --> 00:16:45,068
that we can talk about our friend frosty

503
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,259
organics was on the podcast quite a

504
00:16:45,068 --> 00:16:50,318
while back and he talked about lactic

505
00:16:47,259 --> 00:16:52,000
acid bacteria spray frosty taught us

506
00:16:50,318 --> 00:16:53,558
that he can make his own lactic acid

507
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,879
bacteria spray and apply it to the

508
00:16:53,558 --> 00:16:58,360
plants and he says that one application

509
00:16:54,879 --> 00:16:59,740
will remove his powdery mildew issue I'm

510
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,550
not sure how well that works I have not

511
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:02,799
tried it myself

512
00:17:00,549 --> 00:17:04,480
but I do trust the [ __ ] out of frosty

513
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:07,148
organics so if you want to learn about

514
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,380
lactic acid bacteria and how to treat

515
00:17:07,148 --> 00:17:11,288
your cannabis plants with it

516
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:13,720
you can google lactic acid bacteria and

517
00:17:11,288 --> 00:17:15,879
then powdery mildew and then there will

518
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:17,709
be the word Clackamas in there Clackamas

519
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:20,140
is a city in Oregon there's a guy named

520
00:17:17,709 --> 00:17:22,538
Clackamas coot who is from that part of

521
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:24,339
Oregon who wrote an article about making

522
00:17:22,538 --> 00:17:25,929
lactic acid bacteria to treat for

523
00:17:24,338 --> 00:17:29,889
powdery mildew if you google it it

524
00:17:25,929 --> 00:17:31,090
should not be too hard to find guys

525
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:33,309
something else I want to mention in

526
00:17:31,089 --> 00:17:35,230
professional horticultural applications

527
00:17:33,308 --> 00:17:37,210
and environments what is commonly used

528
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:39,308
for powdery mildew is a product called

529
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:40,870
potassium bicarbonate it's available in

530
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:43,418
several different forms from what I read

531
00:17:40,869 --> 00:17:45,579
they say that it mixes up very much like

532
00:17:43,419 --> 00:17:47,200
a baking soda in water and you apply

533
00:17:45,579 --> 00:17:50,230
that to your plants as a foliar spray

534
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,490
and that disrupts the pH on the surface

535
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:53,140
of the leaf which will get rid

536
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:54,970
of your powdery mildew and it is a

537
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:56,980
horticultural standard it's what they

538
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:59,679
use in large greenhouses for large

539
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:01,450
production so potassium bicarbonate from

540
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:03,640
what I read it's like it comes in a very

541
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:05,679
powdery form that's like baking soda

542
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:07,179
they say it's available in other forms I

543
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:08,920
check that out maybe that's something

544
00:18:07,179 --> 00:18:10,150
that'll help you out if you're in a

545
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:12,009
commercial grow I'm not sure if that

546
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:13,990
will be legal so make sure you check out

547
00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:16,420
all of the laws I don't know where you

548
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:18,308
are I don't know the rules so everything

549
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:21,039
I say needs to be researched before you

550
00:18:18,308 --> 00:18:22,779
apply it another thing that people are

551
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:24,428
gonna recommend for you for your powdery

552
00:18:22,779 --> 00:18:27,279
mildew issue people are going to say to

553
00:18:24,429 --> 00:18:29,350
hang a sulfur burner in the grow and run

554
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:30,970
the sulfur burner for an hour or 45

555
00:18:29,349 --> 00:18:32,049
minutes every few hours or something

556
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:35,230
like that everyone's gonna have their

557
00:18:32,049 --> 00:18:37,178
own recipe I highly advise against this

558
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:39,400
you guys I do not like a sulfur burner

559
00:18:37,179 --> 00:18:41,620
there was a dispensary in Colorado I

560
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:43,720
will not call them out they were in

561
00:18:41,619 --> 00:18:45,369
Denver they were a very very well known

562
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:47,140
dispensary they had a very well-known

563
00:18:45,369 --> 00:18:49,750
breeder working with them who actually

564
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:51,820
left and started his own thing that

565
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:53,650
facility was having a powdery mildew

566
00:18:51,819 --> 00:18:57,549
issue and their solution was to run a

567
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:59,350
sulfur burner the results were for about

568
00:18:57,549 --> 00:19:01,480
six months every time you would shop at

569
00:18:59,349 --> 00:19:04,599
that dispensary everything would have at

570
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:05,890
first it was a flavor of sulfur he would

571
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:08,019
smoke it he'd like why does this taste

572
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:09,070
weird and it was sulfur II once somebody

573
00:19:08,019 --> 00:19:10,299
would say I think there's a sulphur

574
00:19:09,069 --> 00:19:12,220
burner your brain would go yeah it

575
00:19:10,299 --> 00:19:13,539
totally tastes like sulfur so it was

576
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:15,069
really strong at first and over a few

577
00:19:13,539 --> 00:19:16,808
months it faded out but you could taste

578
00:19:15,069 --> 00:19:18,250
it for a long time they've gotten rid of

579
00:19:16,808 --> 00:19:20,289
the sulfur burner they've corrected

580
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:22,000
their problem now it doesn't happen but

581
00:19:20,289 --> 00:19:24,099
that's why you don't run a sulfur burner

582
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,019
in there it will make your plants taste

583
00:19:24,099 --> 00:19:27,849
like [ __ ]

584
00:19:26,019 --> 00:19:29,819
so don't do this all four burner that's

585
00:19:27,849 --> 00:19:31,779
not something I would recommend

586
00:19:29,819 --> 00:19:34,808
something that you can do that may help

587
00:19:31,779 --> 00:19:36,609
you I'm not sure if you're using mother

588
00:19:34,808 --> 00:19:38,109
plants or if you're taking plants taking

589
00:19:36,609 --> 00:19:39,759
cuts from your vegging plants or how

590
00:19:38,109 --> 00:19:40,329
that works but when you were taking

591
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:43,990
clones

592
00:19:40,329 --> 00:19:45,399
I recommend dunking them I cut my clone

593
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:47,829
from the mother plant I put them in a

594
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:49,630
cup with water and a small bit of

595
00:19:47,829 --> 00:19:51,579
nutrients and then I carried that cup

596
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:53,470
filled with cuttings to another area

597
00:19:51,579 --> 00:19:55,539
where they are trimmed up and then they

598
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:57,370
are dunked into a solution and then they

599
00:19:55,539 --> 00:19:59,349
are dipped and then stuck into either

600
00:19:57,369 --> 00:20:01,479
the cloner if I'm working at one

601
00:19:59,349 --> 00:20:03,009
facility or they're put into plugs if

602
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,349
I'm at another facility or they're put

603
00:20:03,009 --> 00:20:04,910
in a

604
00:20:03,349 --> 00:20:05,928
at another facility just depends on

605
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:08,120
where I'm working and who I'm working

606
00:20:05,929 --> 00:20:10,880
with what I got going on but after the

607
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:12,109
cut I like to dunk the freshly cut clone

608
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,210
and trimmed up you cut off the leaves

609
00:20:12,109 --> 00:20:16,250
you trim off all the extra then I dunk

610
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:20,210
that right into something I will change

611
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:23,179
my eye product up sometimes I use vanish

612
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:24,410
sometimes I will use the what's it

613
00:20:23,179 --> 00:20:26,390
called the big-time exterminator you

614
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:27,950
guys I wrote down BTE and I can always

615
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:29,750
forget that stands for a big-time

616
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:31,819
exterminator sometimes I'll mix up the

617
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:33,319
hydrogen peroxide just depends on what's

618
00:20:31,819 --> 00:20:35,990
available and what I'm treating for what

619
00:20:33,319 --> 00:20:37,490
I think may I may be at risk for but we

620
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:39,288
know that powdery mildew was the problem

621
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:41,599
here so mix up a little bit of hydrogen

622
00:20:39,288 --> 00:20:43,279
peroxide in your water I just use a

623
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:45,230
five-gallon bucket I mean anywhere

624
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:47,960
between 30 and 70 mils of hydrogen

625
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:49,849
peroxide usually seems to work for me

626
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:51,110
cut the clone dunk that right into the

627
00:20:49,849 --> 00:20:53,538
five gallon bucket of hydrogen peroxide

628
00:20:51,109 --> 00:20:56,149
give it a nice hefty shake and then put

629
00:20:53,538 --> 00:20:57,710
that into the dip and grow or the clone

630
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:59,630
X or whatever you were using wherever

631
00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:01,700
the hell we are and then stick that

632
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:03,500
right into the the cloner whatever I'm

633
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:05,298
going into and then I know that I killed

634
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,919
all of the powdery mildew so that I've

635
00:21:05,298 --> 00:21:09,048
got a fresh start so that that clone can

636
00:21:06,919 --> 00:21:10,520
root and have a healthy start then as

637
00:21:09,048 --> 00:21:12,109
soon as it roots and it gets put into

638
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:14,960
its first pot I'll spray it with

639
00:21:12,109 --> 00:21:16,819
something and then every I'll spray it

640
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,190
once a week with something and then if I

641
00:21:16,819 --> 00:21:21,980
see powdery mildew or here's a here's a

642
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:23,779
hint a little bit before powdery mildew

643
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:27,169
starts you will see the little tiny

644
00:21:23,779 --> 00:21:29,058
bumps pop up the leaf may start to just

645
00:21:27,169 --> 00:21:30,020
get a little bit bumpy I don't even know

646
00:21:29,058 --> 00:21:31,970
how to it just looks like a little

647
00:21:30,019 --> 00:21:33,259
pimple or a war or something funky

648
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:35,509
coming up on the leaf but it's real

649
00:21:33,259 --> 00:21:37,038
small so if you start seeing that then

650
00:21:35,509 --> 00:21:39,019
it's time to start treating for powdery

651
00:21:37,038 --> 00:21:40,819
mildew extra-strong get out your UV

652
00:21:39,019 --> 00:21:42,558
clean light get out your hydrogen

653
00:21:40,819 --> 00:21:44,210
peroxide get out the PM wash the

654
00:21:42,558 --> 00:21:46,178
big-time exterminator the lactic acid

655
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:48,288
bacteria the potassium bicarbonate

656
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:50,000
something like that get it out there

657
00:21:48,288 --> 00:21:51,829
start treating those plants because

658
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,089
you're gonna see the powdery mildew but

659
00:21:51,829 --> 00:21:54,710
if I see that that's when I start

660
00:21:53,089 --> 00:21:56,689
stepping up my game going a little bit

661
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:59,179
harder one more thing I should mention

662
00:21:56,690 --> 00:22:01,009
is the powdery mildew could be on your

663
00:21:59,179 --> 00:22:02,750
clothes you're carrying it around from

664
00:22:01,009 --> 00:22:04,849
the flower room to the bedroom to the

665
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:06,500
mother room to the clone room it's in

666
00:22:04,849 --> 00:22:09,079
your air-conditioning ducts it's in your

667
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:10,849
HVAC system it is everywhere it needs to

668
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:13,250
be taken care of it needs to be treated

669
00:22:10,849 --> 00:22:15,678
if you've got those silly ducts that

670
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:16,819
have the insulation inside of them tear

671
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:18,440
that [ __ ] out of there

672
00:22:16,819 --> 00:22:20,569
that could be a multi-thousand dollar

673
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:22,759
job for your facility but all of that

674
00:22:20,569 --> 00:22:24,678
insulation inside of there is harboring

675
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:26,599
harboring that was a hard word to say

676
00:22:24,679 --> 00:22:29,360
the insulation is harboring powdery

677
00:22:26,599 --> 00:22:31,189
mildew and it will eventually be a place

678
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:34,069
for bugs to hide out once one gets in

679
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:35,659
there just takes two and those bugs will

680
00:22:34,069 --> 00:22:36,740
start a party it'll be disgusting so you

681
00:22:35,659 --> 00:22:37,970
could have the powdery mildew one or

682
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:39,829
close make sure everybody's changing

683
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:41,389
clothes properly I bet you've got a

684
00:22:39,829 --> 00:22:44,028
grower that has a private grow at home

685
00:22:41,388 --> 00:22:45,769
and he's got powdery mildew also and as

686
00:22:44,028 --> 00:22:47,898
soon as he starts getting rid of powdery

687
00:22:45,769 --> 00:22:49,220
mildew you get it worse and then as soon

688
00:22:47,898 --> 00:22:50,808
as your facility starts getting it

689
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:52,190
cleaned up he gets it worse and you guys

690
00:22:50,808 --> 00:22:54,308
are just passing that [ __ ] back and

691
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:56,929
forth and it's never gonna go away

692
00:22:54,308 --> 00:22:58,700
so start changing your clothes get some

693
00:22:56,929 --> 00:23:01,190
dedicated clothes dedicated shoes a

694
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:03,379
dedicated hat if you've got long hair or

695
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:04,820
dreadlocks get it wrapped up get it in a

696
00:23:03,378 --> 00:23:06,740
hat and get it covered up you guys I'm

697
00:23:04,819 --> 00:23:07,878
always going and re tucking my dreads

698
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,298
because I try to keep everything covered

699
00:23:07,878 --> 00:23:10,459
up

700
00:23:08,298 --> 00:23:12,138
I don't want dragging my dreads long

701
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:14,028
around the grow think it's gross I need

702
00:23:12,138 --> 00:23:15,678
to be picking up bugs or leaving a hair

703
00:23:14,028 --> 00:23:16,849
in the flowers just just keep your

704
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:18,860
dreads and your hair covered up if

705
00:23:16,849 --> 00:23:20,148
you've got a big man look beard or if

706
00:23:18,859 --> 00:23:22,398
you've got a hipster beard cover that

707
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:24,709
[ __ ] up too I just try to be clean you

708
00:23:22,398 --> 00:23:27,109
guys another thing I really want to

709
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:28,970
recommend I did work in a facility that

710
00:23:27,109 --> 00:23:30,528
was riddled with powdery mildew I won't

711
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:31,730
call them out on a podcast most of my

712
00:23:30,528 --> 00:23:33,648
friends and listeners know who the [ __ ]

713
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:35,960
I'm talking about the place was riddled

714
00:23:33,648 --> 00:23:38,239
with powdery mildew they fired a grower

715
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:39,860
I took over I walked in and I said we've

716
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,269
got bugs and powdery mildew to start

717
00:23:39,859 --> 00:23:43,069
with and they're like yes we do help us

718
00:23:41,269 --> 00:23:45,558
I tried to get rid of it you guys but

719
00:23:43,069 --> 00:23:48,230
being Emmy deregulated I understand the

720
00:23:45,558 --> 00:23:50,388
struggle that my listener here has it

721
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:52,099
was a pain in the ass everybody in that

722
00:23:50,388 --> 00:23:53,388
grow got sick because of the powdery

723
00:23:52,099 --> 00:23:55,398
mildew the mildew is gone you guys it

724
00:23:53,388 --> 00:23:57,138
took two or three crops two or three

725
00:23:55,398 --> 00:23:58,729
crop cycles to get rid of it but the

726
00:23:57,138 --> 00:24:00,439
powdery mildew was actually gone we got

727
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:02,389
rid of it in a hundred light facility

728
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,558
that p.m. was gone you could not see it

729
00:24:02,388 --> 00:24:05,628
you could not smell it you could not

730
00:24:03,558 --> 00:24:07,730
taste it it was cleaned up so they did

731
00:24:05,628 --> 00:24:10,158
their job they got rid of it but

732
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:11,870
everybody kind of got like a scientist

733
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:13,639
sort of thing everybody showed different

734
00:24:11,869 --> 00:24:14,928
symptoms but everybody could agree that

735
00:24:13,638 --> 00:24:17,839
it was messing up their noses their

736
00:24:14,929 --> 00:24:19,610
throat and their eye region so wear a

737
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:21,349
mask if you've got a ventilator or

738
00:24:19,609 --> 00:24:24,349
respirator or even one of those just

739
00:24:21,349 --> 00:24:25,519
shitty little paper Asian bird flu masks

740
00:24:24,349 --> 00:24:26,750
just wear one of those when you're

741
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:28,339
working with a powdery mildew because

742
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:30,650
you don't want to get sick from it I

743
00:24:28,339 --> 00:24:32,419
tried to deny that I was sick

744
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:35,000
from the powdery mildew but once it was

745
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:37,910
gone I felt better and I could tell that

746
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,559
my allergy problem and my throat thing

747
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:40,910
was happening because of that powdery

748
00:24:39,559 --> 00:24:43,099
mildew that's what was doing it so

749
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:46,430
please take care of yourself if the

750
00:24:43,099 --> 00:24:48,469
plants are bad powdery mildew E you have

751
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:51,860
to think about if you want to release

752
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:53,420
that product to the public because you

753
00:24:51,859 --> 00:24:56,569
don't want to be responsible for making

754
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:57,470
people sick so that's a moral thing

755
00:24:56,569 --> 00:25:00,409
you're gonna have to think about

756
00:24:57,470 --> 00:25:03,529
yourself something that they do allow

757
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:06,529
here in Colorado they will let you blast

758
00:25:03,529 --> 00:25:09,649
the powdery mildew buds the marijuana

759
00:25:06,529 --> 00:25:13,220
Enforcement Division has decided that it

760
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:15,530
is safe to put powdery mildew buds and

761
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:21,019
trim into a tube and run butane over and

762
00:25:15,529 --> 00:25:24,230
turn it in to Pho hash dabs shatter wax

763
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:27,109
it turns into distillate eventually it

764
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:28,730
gets put into edibles eventually so yeah

765
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:30,500
they're deeming it safe so if that's

766
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:32,210
what you want to do with it do that

767
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:33,500
that's the best I can recommend with it

768
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:36,170
but honestly if it's coated in powdered

769
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:37,579
mildew think about this my friend Doug

770
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:39,620
is getting old and Doug's got a lung

771
00:25:37,579 --> 00:25:41,960
problem and when Doug smokes regular

772
00:25:39,619 --> 00:25:43,699
cannabis he coughs what Doug smokes

773
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:46,370
cannabis that's got something on it he

774
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:48,350
coughs a lot and gets really sick Doug

775
00:25:46,369 --> 00:25:50,539
is smoking because he's sick and trying

776
00:25:48,349 --> 00:25:53,119
to prolong and save his life we do not

777
00:25:50,539 --> 00:25:55,730
want to give Doug powdery mildews and

778
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:57,709
mycotoxins and funky [ __ ] for his lungs

779
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:59,870
to kill him more quickly

780
00:25:57,710 --> 00:26:03,170
I love Doug I [ __ ] want him here

781
00:25:59,869 --> 00:26:04,699
treat everybody like Doug okay everybody

782
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:06,950
that's getting cannabis is my friend

783
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:08,660
Doug in my mind we all have to take care

784
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:11,269
of all of our patients like they are

785
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:13,460
Doug alright Doug is a real dude but I

786
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:15,079
kind of exaggerated his story Doug's not

787
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:16,309
that sick you guys just wanted to use

788
00:26:15,079 --> 00:26:18,859
him as an example because he's a good

789
00:26:16,309 --> 00:26:20,240
dude all right I hope I've given you

790
00:26:18,859 --> 00:26:22,789
some information that kind of teaches

791
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:24,170
you how to at least control and harness

792
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:25,579
and get rid of this powdery mildew I'm

793
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:27,830
not sure what you can do where you are

794
00:26:25,579 --> 00:26:29,269
so you can spray any of these products

795
00:26:27,829 --> 00:26:31,519
that you choose to spray you can D

796
00:26:29,269 --> 00:26:34,220
foliate things that I fully recommend

797
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:36,799
you do are get the old air out the fresh

798
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:39,380
air in dehumidified do some filtration

799
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:40,519
also space out the plants a little bit

800
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:43,040
make sure they aren't touching each

801
00:26:40,519 --> 00:26:44,259
other and then control temperature

802
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:45,639
swings you're in the Des

803
00:26:44,259 --> 00:26:47,259
and you're putting a bunch of water

804
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:48,640
inside of a building you're making it

805
00:26:47,259 --> 00:26:51,308
excuse me you're making a big Tupperware

806
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,600
dish and it's you're making a giant comb

807
00:26:51,308 --> 00:26:55,298
dome is what you're doing in there so

808
00:26:52,599 --> 00:26:58,058
you need to evacuate the humidity and

809
00:26:55,298 --> 00:26:59,139
get that out of the room don't be afraid

810
00:26:58,058 --> 00:27:00,279
to throw away some plants if they're

811
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:01,450
starting to get too bad I know that

812
00:27:00,279 --> 00:27:02,740
sounds terrible in a commercial

813
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:04,330
production facility I've been there

814
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:06,370

815
00:27:04,329 --> 00:27:07,449
you're dealing with some days it makes

816
00:27:06,369 --> 00:27:09,579
you want to punch yourself straight in

817
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:11,950
the face but I did an episode a few

818
00:27:09,579 --> 00:27:13,779

819
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:15,400
if you didn't have powdery mildew you

820
00:27:13,779 --> 00:27:16,509

would be too easy wouldn't be a

822
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:19,929
challenge wouldn't be fun anymore so you

823
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:22,150
got to go through some struggles and

824
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:23,530
