everybody let's get off the Horn

106
00:04:10,489 --> 00:04:18,829
advertising so these two guys have been

107
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:22,159
responsible for their medical marijuana

108
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:25,009
for over five years that I can say for

109
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,330
sure without a doubt yeah five or six

110
00:04:25,009 --> 00:04:28,939
years okay I was gonna say closer to

111
00:04:26,329 --> 00:04:30,439
eight or ten maybe even it's getting

112
00:04:28,939 --> 00:04:31,668
there it's getting there okay yeah I

113
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:33,978
don't have a good sense of time I

114
00:04:31,668 --> 00:04:40,159
honestly do not do that honest I used to

115
00:04:33,978 --> 00:04:43,579
remember time periods by what fish do a

116
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:45,560
lot of fish used to document how much

117
00:04:43,579 --> 00:04:47,060
time I was spending places all right so

118
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,439
I've been responsible for these guys

119
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:51,379
medical marijuana and I have noticed

120
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:53,000
that when Mike wants to get high he

121
00:04:51,379 --> 00:04:54,560
wants to smoke some sativa like some

122
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,329
Jillybean that we just took dabs up or

123
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,000
some gold go but when Mike needs

124
00:04:56,329 --> 00:05:00,409
medicine he reaches for the heavy CBD I

125
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,180
got this door over here if either one of

126
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:07,189
you would like a dam this big clear

127
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:09,400
that's almost pure CBD that was given to

128
00:05:07,189 --> 00:05:09,399
me

129
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:15,079
these guys excuse me for the coffee when

130
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:16,490
these guys are hurting when they feel

131
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:18,680
pain they hit me up and they're like do

132
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:21,230
you have something extra CBD for me

133
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:23,209
right now cuz Mike's got sore hands

134
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:24,710
Mike's our Doug was an old railroad

135
00:05:23,209 --> 00:05:26,029
worker over here you got a picture this

136
00:05:24,709 --> 00:05:28,489
guy he's in jeans and a flannel shirt

137
00:05:26,029 --> 00:05:30,349
with a big-ass knife on his Bell this

138
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:32,360
man looks like he is ready to do some

139
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:34,600
work whatever you need done I'm sure and

140
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:37,689
confident Doug can handle that work

141
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:46,970
certainly give it a shot yeah I'm sure

142
00:05:37,689 --> 00:05:48,350
than myself but Doug's a confident man

143
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:50,450
he can work it but he's an old railroad

144
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:51,170
guy and so he's pretty much broken all

145
00:05:50,449 --> 00:05:52,879
over the place

146
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:55,370
broken all over the place yeah back

147
00:05:52,879 --> 00:06:04,879
knees all the joints all the joints are

148
00:05:55,370 --> 00:06:07,009
in bad shape not at all 61 years old so

149
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:08,930
my friend Doug is 61 and medical

150
00:06:07,009 --> 00:06:12,920
cannabis is keeping the student movement

151
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:13,970
that he hurts we give them some CBD do

152
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,110
you have a family were just gonna kind

153
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:17,840
of jump into this part do you have a

154
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:22,250
favorite way to consume your CBD

155
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:26,539
medicine my my favorite way to consume

156
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:28,610
is with my little electric pen okay my

157
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:31,970
old lady calls it the pacifier because

158
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:33,590
it's always around my neck you never

159
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:38,600
know when you're gonna need it and it's

160
00:06:33,589 --> 00:06:40,759
one of the most resin coated has been

161
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:43,939
around the block well you know it had to

162
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:45,709
have a little extra work done to it

163
00:06:43,939 --> 00:06:48,110
because those glass tops just don't work

164
00:06:45,709 --> 00:06:50,389
for me oh yeah I know how you get been a

165
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:52,460
little modified there that's pretty it's

166
00:06:50,389 --> 00:06:56,060
custom but it but it works really good

167
00:06:52,459 --> 00:07:00,769
it's there at a moment's notice

168
00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:02,629
okay and it's the way that seems to well

169
00:07:00,769 --> 00:07:04,549
anytime you smoke it we all know that

170
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:07,759
that that's the quickest way to get it

171
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:10,730
yes and when you're in pain and you want

172
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:13,430
relief now I find that's the quickest

173
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:14,720
way so what's gonna hurt most frequently

174
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:16,100
if we're hanging out what are you gonna

175
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,380
say [ __ ] this hurts what are you gonna

176
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:20,510
grab first my hip your hip my hip my

177
00:07:18,379 --> 00:07:22,288
lower back okay so then you're probably

178
00:07:20,509 --> 00:07:23,668
gonna say [ __ ] that hurts

179
00:07:22,288 --> 00:07:26,158
and thought is gonna be where's my vape

180
00:07:23,668 --> 00:07:28,378
pen right exactly how long from inhaling

181
00:07:26,158 --> 00:07:29,848
off okay first how many rips off that

182
00:07:28,379 --> 00:07:32,158
pin does it take to kind of give you a

183
00:07:29,848 --> 00:07:34,498
little relief to notice some easing of

184
00:07:32,158 --> 00:07:36,240
the pain to notice easing of the pain

185
00:07:34,499 --> 00:07:38,189
publican doctor as I asked the probably

186
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,439
within two or three two or three ripped

187
00:07:38,189 --> 00:07:42,119
off the vision I'll tell you the truth

188
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:44,249
I'd like the truth

189
00:07:42,119 --> 00:07:46,050
holding you're not under oath or holding

190
00:07:44,249 --> 00:07:47,789
the damn thing in my hand and knowing

191
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:50,520
that I'm about to take a hit off of it

192
00:07:47,788 --> 00:07:53,248
starts the process right there because I

193
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:57,180
know relief it's a haunted - it comes on

194
00:07:53,249 --> 00:08:01,080
its way and I think I've told you this

195
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:04,918
before your definition of what a pain

196
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:09,588
killer is we know that CBeebies help

197
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:15,598
control pain but marijuana in general

198
00:08:09,588 --> 00:08:19,559
changes your outlook on pain okay so I

199
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:21,718
think it's and what is pain relief I

200
00:08:19,559 --> 00:08:24,959
mean that's what that's what pain

201
00:08:21,718 --> 00:08:26,668
killers do is they well we know that

202
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:29,269
there there's chemicals that go in and

203
00:08:26,668 --> 00:08:32,129
right and shut down certain receptors

204
00:08:29,269 --> 00:08:33,658
maybe maybe the THC part is making you

205
00:08:32,129 --> 00:08:35,370
forget that you her and helping your

206
00:08:33,658 --> 00:08:38,698
mind go to a better place and being

207
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:39,448
focused on that going out on you and

208
00:08:38,698 --> 00:08:41,788
hurt okay

209
00:08:39,448 --> 00:08:43,649
right okay so two or three reps and you

210
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:45,328
start feeling that forgetting about the

211
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:48,649
pain and a little bit of pain going away

212
00:08:45,328 --> 00:08:48,649
yes how long does that take

213
00:08:52,889 --> 00:08:55,960
[Music]

214
00:08:56,539 --> 00:09:01,740
okay it starts right then within about

215
00:09:00,089 --> 00:09:08,220
two or three rips which only takes you

216
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:09,899
know go back to doing whatever you

217
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:25,079
needed to do take care the kid water the

218
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:26,519
dog if you were to take and ask about

219
00:09:25,078 --> 00:09:28,438
any pharmaceuticals that I know you take

220
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:29,549
but if you were to take a pharmaceutical

221
00:09:28,438 --> 00:09:31,919
to treat that pain

222
00:09:29,549 --> 00:09:33,509
oh no 20 minutes 20 minutes you know if

223
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:34,639
you're lucky and then what are the side

224
00:09:33,509 --> 00:09:38,939
effects

225
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:43,169
he just leaned back into got all day and

226
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:45,709
we do so opiates right which is the

227
00:09:43,169 --> 00:09:50,549
major ones okay

228
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:52,799
anywhere from the dry mouth to listless

229
00:09:50,549 --> 00:09:58,528
feeling to constipation

230
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:59,939
okay well that's their that's the way

231
00:09:58,528 --> 00:10:04,500
they do medicine anymore at all

232
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:07,110
absolutely it's just prescribing other

233
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:12,360
medication and see how that work is that

234
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:14,550
you on skype I know that I've done that

235
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:19,579
before I will never do that again

236
00:10:14,549 --> 00:10:19,578
skyping with your doctor is not a good

237
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:26,430
to be able to look around the room and

238
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:28,320
see the diplomas with just a shirt on

239
00:10:26,429 --> 00:10:30,328
kids that's you know that's all you see

240
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,980
it's not like you can look around and

241
00:10:30,328 --> 00:10:33,929
you're like you know there's interaction

242
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:37,139
between humans that doesn't happen on

243
00:10:33,929 --> 00:10:39,359
Scott absolutely especially someone from

244
00:10:37,139 --> 00:10:41,490
your generation Skype is probably

245
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:45,750
[ __ ] Fingal technology for you yeah

246
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:49,259

247
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:59,429
don't expect you to be that current no

248
00:10:49,259 --> 00:11:01,350
idea what was happening all right so

249
00:10:59,429 --> 00:11:03,120
we'll get back on topic here so within

250
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:04,860
30 seconds to a minute you're feeling

251
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,360

thanks a lot for getting let me get so

255
00:11:09,149 --> 00:11:12,889
personal ask about your medicine side

256
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:15,899
effects and sure that's gonna deep

257
00:11:12,889 --> 00:11:18,419
compared to taking pills I don't see why

258
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:19,559
we can't grow our own why if you don't

259
00:11:18,419 --> 00:11:21,208
want us to grow our own medicine when

260
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:23,849
this dude can feel better in 20 minutes

261
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:27,659
from taking a ripoff of a vaping money

262
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:30,120
it works like what you say if cannabis

263
00:11:27,659 --> 00:11:32,309
didn't do half of what it does like it

264
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:34,379
would be legal we discovered it right

265
00:11:32,309 --> 00:11:35,549
now it would be celebrated everywhere so

266
00:11:34,379 --> 00:11:37,588
let's should print that on a shirt if

267
00:11:35,549 --> 00:11:39,870
cannabis didn't do half of what it does

268
00:11:37,589 --> 00:11:42,540
it wouldn't it would be illegal yeah

269
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:45,419
yeah it's true if it if it just worked

270
00:11:42,539 --> 00:11:46,240
as medicine if we could just replace you

271
00:11:45,419 --> 00:11:47,919
know cotton

272
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,889
with it like all the pharmacies we could

273
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:52,929
just do one replaced by it yep I don't

274
00:11:50,889 --> 00:11:54,458
know about all like they're still used

275
00:11:52,929 --> 00:11:56,469
for plenty of what Pharma has to offer

276
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:58,239
it's just cannabis replaces a lot of

277
00:11:56,470 --> 00:12:01,830
what we're using in a Pharma

278
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:04,810
inappropriately for now you bet

279
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:08,730
anyone that's taking vicodin realizes

280
00:12:04,809 --> 00:12:12,088
that just up the uptick from I think a

281
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:15,129
grade two or a grade three - agreed -

282
00:12:12,089 --> 00:12:16,810
narcotic if so there's no refills you

283
00:12:15,129 --> 00:12:19,299
have to go to your doctor you have to

284
00:12:16,809 --> 00:12:22,088
get a hard script from them and walk it

285
00:12:19,299 --> 00:12:26,500
to your pharmacy it has to be filled out

286
00:12:22,089 --> 00:12:28,420
on a certain day it's it's incredible

287
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:30,610
and then and the reason is because of

288
00:12:28,419 --> 00:12:33,549
the incredible losses that we've had of

289
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:34,720
life due to overdose right and it's on

290
00:12:33,549 --> 00:12:36,849
the streets everywhere it's easier

291
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,589
sometimes to find stupid drugs and pills

292
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:41,080
than it is to find weed and before we

293
00:12:38,589 --> 00:12:45,160
had dispensaries we could find the weed

294
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:47,709
back in the day other drugs can't find

295
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:50,259
the weed right yeah it's not that hard

296
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:52,000
it actually would be easier for me to

297
00:12:50,259 --> 00:12:54,458
get some of this medication on the

298
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,320
street than it is from the dog and then

299
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:57,699
that's what unfortunately results to in

300
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,990
heroin use when you can't get those

301
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:02,800
pills anymore from your insurance

302
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:04,659
company you're gonna have to go you

303
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:06,578
wouldn't do it you got a strong mind and

304
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:07,958
keep you medicated with good weed but

305
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:09,458
other folks that don't have good weed

306
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:11,078
and a good caregiver and a good family

307
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:12,159
like yourself they would have to go to

308
00:13:11,078 --> 00:13:13,509
the street and get something because

309
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:17,110
everybody hurts they're sick from not

310
00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:18,850
having their pills that's are facing an

311
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:22,690
increase in heroin use right now and

312
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:24,190
that's exactly why is regular folk get

313
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:26,649
hurt they go to the doctor the doctor

314
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:28,089
throws opiates at them they take the

315
00:13:26,649 --> 00:13:30,700
pill until their bones not broken

316
00:13:28,089 --> 00:13:32,200
anymore and by the time they're healed

317
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:35,320
though they're now addicted to whatever

318
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:36,910
painkiller they were alright find it

319
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:38,980
eventually they get cut off or it

320
00:13:36,909 --> 00:13:41,230
becomes too expensive and they turn to

321
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:44,649
heroin get some help if you need help

322
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:46,360
you guys please and feel free to tell

323
00:13:44,649 --> 00:13:48,129
the doctor no you don't need pain pills

324
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,839
like sometimes you pain feels I'm not

325
00:13:48,129 --> 00:13:52,179
saying people don't because I've used

326
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:53,890
them many many times but really when I

327
00:13:52,179 --> 00:13:55,838
broke my finger I had to refuse pain

328
00:13:53,889 --> 00:13:58,029
meds six different times I kept asking

329
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,470
if the pain was gonna get any worse

330
00:13:58,029 --> 00:14:15,209
and they kept looking at me like I was

331
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:17,590
insane vibrates stupid loud no problem

332
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:18,940
all right so Mike I won't ask you the

333
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:20,889
same question kind of that I was asking

334
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:23,740
Doug since we got off track your need to

335
00:14:20,889 --> 00:14:25,120
find a good launching spot can ask what

336
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:26,259
your medical condition is that you

337
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,460
smoked for and you don't have to go to

338
00:14:26,259 --> 00:14:30,370
any detail if you don't feel like it

339
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:33,490
the short version version is I damaged

340
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:35,710
my neck and never had cartilage in my

341
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:38,080
knees and so I need something that helps

342
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:40,750
with inflammation and nerve generated

343
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:42,970
pain and cannabis works wonderfully

344
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:45,309
where most of the drugs available on the

345
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:48,490
pharmaceutical market don't do anything

346
00:14:45,309 --> 00:14:50,079
for nerve generated pain No so how long

347
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:54,580
if you took a what's your preferred

348
00:14:50,080 --> 00:15:05,440
method of smoking right now dabbing yeah

349
00:14:54,580 --> 00:15:08,830

350
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:10,810
flowers are bong in bong and flowers if

351
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:12,879

352
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:14,829

353
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:18,338
bond yep and have just been piping it

354
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:20,110
for a long time and then recently

355
00:15:18,339 --> 00:15:22,390
upgraded to an oil rig and a nice nail

356
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:24,339
and a torch and I've been doing a lot of

357
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:26,139
dabs lately the flowers are still sort

358
00:15:24,339 --> 00:15:28,420

360
00:15:28,419 --> 00:15:37,689
shout out for that right on thank you

361
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:43,889
that's delicious the most common way I

362
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:47,230
consume these days is with ginger I do

363
00:15:43,889 --> 00:15:50,889
three milliliters of synergy which is a

364
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:54,519
half THC half CBD tincture compound

365
00:15:50,889 --> 00:15:56,409
that's really really low dose and I take

366
00:15:54,519 --> 00:15:58,240
it sort of as a preventive morning and

367
00:15:56,409 --> 00:16:02,500
evening to help keep the inflammation

368
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:04,870
down before it gets bad and that seems

369
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:08,809
to work wonders for my knees and for my

370
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:12,950
back what do those cost for a customer

371
00:16:08,809 --> 00:16:15,739
forty forty bucks before tax or a

372
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:18,259
hundred milligrams total so for me

373
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:19,820
that's a week's worth of meds okay Wow

374
00:16:18,259 --> 00:16:21,889
okay forty bucks for a week worth of

375
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:24,050
meds yep you get thirty doses per bottle

376
00:16:21,889 --> 00:16:26,330
and I'm taking six a day so it's not

377
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:27,909
even a seven-day week for me it's a

378
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:30,528
five-day week for me all right

379
00:16:27,909 --> 00:16:33,500
dang okay so it's worth it for 40 bucks

380
00:16:30,528 --> 00:16:35,570
I was paying more when I was just taking

381
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:37,850
pills oh yeah oh yeah pills are

382
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:39,800
expensive yep even if you've just got a

383
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:41,720
copay or something yeah I was just doing

384
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:43,490
a copay and it was still 90 bucks a week

385
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,778
I got some vicodins when I got some

386
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:46,580
wisdom teeth pulled and going to get

387
00:16:44,778 --> 00:16:48,200
those was like 14 bucks for like seven

388
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:50,690
pills and that was the generic [ __ ] I

389
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:53,330
don't even really need them why not a

390
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:55,730
bunch of money for need when I stopped

391
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:56,839
taking pills I was on two different pain

392
00:16:55,730 --> 00:17:00,200
medications

393
00:16:56,839 --> 00:17:02,420
neither of them were opiates but neither

394
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:04,100
of them worked for [ __ ] either and then

395
00:17:02,419 --> 00:17:05,449
I was on a third med to help cope with

396
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:07,849
some of the side effects from the first

397
00:17:05,449 --> 00:17:11,329
two of course and when I started smoking

398
00:17:07,849 --> 00:17:15,230
regularly and first got access to CBD

399
00:17:11,328 --> 00:17:16,938
flour I didn't have a need for the pills

400
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:18,650
at all the next day so I just didn't

401
00:17:16,939 --> 00:17:20,660
take them one day and then I didn't take

402
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:22,819
him the next day either nice so now

403
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:24,709
you're drug-free well except for

404
00:17:22,818 --> 00:17:38,720
cannabis you're drug-free bro I don't

405
00:17:24,709 --> 00:17:40,480
think so how long does this go ahead

406
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,200
I'll get some Sam well no I was just

407
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,940
interesting what are you saying but I

408
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:47,509
was thinking while he was saying that

409
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:50,500
that since I'm primarily using

410
00:17:47,509 --> 00:17:50,500
concentrates now

411
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:57,870
I've gotten completely off of two

412
00:17:54,990 --> 00:18:01,380
narcotic medications that I was getting

413
00:17:57,869 --> 00:18:03,059
through my doctor Wow from smokin

414
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:05,100
concentrates on a daily basis

415
00:18:03,059 --> 00:18:14,089
smoking concentrates on a daily basis

416
00:18:05,099 --> 00:18:17,159
how long how often do you smoke probably

417
00:18:14,089 --> 00:18:19,139
starting within an hour after I wake

418
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:22,200
okay yeah because you got to keep the

419
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:26,580
pain away before it sets in right and

420
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:29,100
then throughout the day it's not like a

421
00:18:26,579 --> 00:18:32,639
sit down smoke fest for me it's it's

422
00:18:29,099 --> 00:18:35,669
just a fire so you got it right around

423
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:39,000
my neck take a couple of rips and as I'm

424
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:42,330
going on my merry way that's one of the

425
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,910
things I really like about my pen I find

426
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:46,829
myself using it when I get home between

427
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:48,450

428

456
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:06,490
he's smoking top-quality shatter

457

479
00:21:10,538 --> 00:21:17,048
gram here locally but it's not always

480
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:19,148
quality know there's still a lot of real

481
00:21:17,048 --> 00:21:21,668
mediocre amateur product on the market

482
00:21:19,148 --> 00:21:23,408
right now because we're or even our

483
00:21:21,669 --> 00:21:26,130
legal market doesn't have all of the

484
00:21:23,409 --> 00:21:28,889
things in place that it should quality

485
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:32,110
standards are still little acts a little

486
00:21:28,888 --> 00:21:34,479
did you buy any of the live wax from the

487

purchased any but I have consumed some I

489
00:21:36,429 --> 00:21:45,540
would like a review of that stupendous

490
00:21:38,648 --> 00:21:48,099
stupendous that works just

491
00:21:45,539 --> 00:21:49,720
we got half a dozen flavors on the shop

492
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:51,519
now but I got some of the start it was

493
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:54,309
incredible guys maybe investigate

494
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:56,619
investing I just the night I dropped my

495
00:21:54,309 --> 00:21:58,359
rig oh I got to try it

496
00:21:56,619 --> 00:21:59,709
and so that was the consolation ten

497
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:18,490
minutes later while I was mourning the

498
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:20,860
loss of my original yeah alright so I

499
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:22,870
asked Doug how quickly it works how he

500
00:22:20,859 --> 00:22:24,250
consumes it and how much of it he uses

501
00:22:22,869 --> 00:22:26,139
now I want to jump to Mike we've talked

502
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:27,279
about how he's using tinctures I want to

503
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:29,230
ask about when you've been dabbing

504
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:34,170
lately how many dad's does it take for

505
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:38,410
you to feel relief one to feel relief

506
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:40,990
two to kind of push the pain down to

507
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:43,360
where it's sort of like your toe edge is

508
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:44,740
it's no longer something of it's

509
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:46,240
something you're aware of but it's not

510
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:51,329
something of importance that's how I

511
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:53,740
feel after work usually about three I

512
00:22:51,329 --> 00:22:59,859
think of as Mike sized ABS which are

513
00:22:53,740 --> 00:23:03,460
fairly small dabs yeah I was gonna say

514
00:22:59,859 --> 00:23:05,919
maybe 0.1 a dab maybe even a little less

515
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:09,279
than that sometimes but after about

516
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:12,070
three like there's some intoxication and

517
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:14,049
like a lot more fun going on then then

518
00:23:12,069 --> 00:23:16,750
just medical effect with that first dab

519
00:23:14,049 --> 00:23:20,109
is all just turning the pain down from a

520
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:21,819
five down into the one or two range all

521
00:23:20,109 --> 00:23:23,259
right so two and a half dabs would be

522
00:23:21,819 --> 00:23:24,879
cool but you take that number three

523
00:23:23,259 --> 00:23:27,369
because you can't take a half dab right

524
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:30,700
and then there's something then there's

525
00:23:27,369 --> 00:23:32,409
some intoxication going on alright but

526
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:34,539
but you can handle six or eight dams

527
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:41,170
yeah I can sit here and take eight or

528
00:23:34,539 --> 00:23:43,359
ten and still be coherent all right so

529
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:44,769
let's get to the the synergy drops that

530
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:48,039
you've been taken

531
00:23:44,769 --> 00:23:50,740
you said you take three milliliters how

532
00:23:48,039 --> 00:23:53,920
often a three milliliters in the morning

533
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:58,569
a three at night and the dosing is 1.7

534
00:23:53,920 --> 00:24:00,639
milligrams of THC and CBD per milliliter

535
00:23:58,569 --> 00:24:04,148
so if I remember this I'm taking about

536
00:24:00,638 --> 00:24:06,069
five point eight milligrams of each in

537
00:24:04,148 --> 00:24:08,258
the morning and then in the evening now

538
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:10,808
I could drink the whole 100 milligram

539
00:24:08,259 --> 00:24:12,999
bottle so 50 milligrams of both it just

540
00:24:10,808 --> 00:24:15,338
drank it down like a shot or a drug like

541
00:24:12,999 --> 00:24:18,190
a beer and not get much intoxication

542
00:24:15,338 --> 00:24:19,719
from it but if I take it in small doses

543
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:21,609
in the morning in the evening it feels

544
00:24:19,719 --> 00:24:23,409
like my knees never get to the point

545
00:24:21,608 --> 00:24:25,868
where they're really swollen and stiff

546
00:24:23,409 --> 00:24:27,969
and achy okay and my neck never gets to

547
00:24:25,868 --> 00:24:30,428
the point where it's just a solid bar of

548
00:24:27,969 --> 00:24:31,838
muscle cramped up trying to protect

549
00:24:30,429 --> 00:24:33,669
those vertebrae that are squeezing

550
00:24:31,838 --> 00:24:34,568
nervous it's nurse that was going down

551
00:24:33,669 --> 00:24:36,940
that arm all right

552
00:24:34,568 --> 00:24:39,969
and you guys I feel like my mic is

553
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:42,879
really hot part of what why is that are

554
00:24:39,969 --> 00:24:45,578
doing the THC CBD combo is I believe

555
00:24:42,878 --> 00:24:46,868
that you need both cannabinoids to get

556
00:24:45,578 --> 00:24:48,940
into your bloodstream to work together

557
00:24:46,868 --> 00:24:50,648
to hit the mind a little bit to take

558
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:53,469
your mind off of things to work on the

559
00:24:50,648 --> 00:24:56,798
the THC hits the nerve pain I think the

560
00:24:53,469 --> 00:24:59,349
CBD goes for the like the swollen stuff

561
00:24:56,798 --> 00:25:00,969
I think together you don't get it super

562
00:24:59,348 --> 00:25:04,958
high from me you don't feel much high

563
00:25:00,969 --> 00:25:07,149
from the CBD THC 50/50 combo because the

564
00:25:04,959 --> 00:25:10,538
CBD really feels like it calms down the

565
00:25:07,148 --> 00:25:13,598
high it's there's research into that CBD

566
00:25:10,538 --> 00:25:17,078
keeps the THC high from being quite a

567
00:25:13,598 --> 00:25:18,308
psychoactive so the the CBD helps kind

568
00:25:17,078 --> 00:25:20,999
of tone it down there's I've heard

569
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:23,019
people carry CBD pills from time to time

570
00:25:20,999 --> 00:25:24,489
when there's gonna be extreme

571
00:25:23,019 --> 00:25:26,709
consumption going on just in case

572
00:25:24,489 --> 00:25:28,479
anybody goes a little overboard they've

573
00:25:26,709 --> 00:25:30,038
got sort of a come down lever that they

574
00:25:28,479 --> 00:25:31,838
can pull up your girlfriend takes a big

575
00:25:30,038 --> 00:25:34,118
dab and can't handle her [ __ ] you just

576
00:25:31,838 --> 00:25:54,638
give her a CBD dab and she'll relax a

577
00:25:34,118 --> 00:25:58,058
little in theory in theory yeah all

578
00:25:54,638 --> 00:26:01,388
right so how much does this energy cost

579
00:25:58,058 --> 00:26:03,878
for TIA bottle yeah okay

580
00:26:01,388 --> 00:26:06,608
and it lasts you a week five days five

581
00:26:03,878 --> 00:26:08,228
days all right and Doug's plant pan if

582
00:26:06,608 --> 00:26:11,558
you go to a dispensary it's gonna be 40

583
00:26:08,229 --> 00:26:12,440
45 30 maybe 25 if you can you can fit in

584
00:26:11,558 --> 00:26:14,690
fine

585
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:20,029
like member pricing and you get that

586
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:30,940
first time I've seen advertising on

587
00:26:20,029 --> 00:26:36,920
certain days at certain times a constant

588
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:40,009
quality like you deliver right so the

589
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:45,650
difference between a good caregiver bad

590
00:26:40,009 --> 00:26:48,529
caregiver is I wish that I did not have

591
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:50,150
to charge anything for the hash that he

592
00:26:48,529 --> 00:26:52,279
consumes but it doesn't always come from

593
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:53,690
me so I have to go get it so I have to

594
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:55,639
just relay it and I don't make a penny

595
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:57,259
off of my my caregiver earnest for

596
00:26:55,640 --> 00:27:01,970
people like people that I am their

597
00:26:57,259 --> 00:27:04,279
caregiver I don't know Steve's pretty

598
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:09,140
well medicated yes I do yes he does he's

599
00:27:04,279 --> 00:27:14,869
got some full right now White Widow in a

600
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:17,600
couple few days you know I have that

601
00:27:14,869 --> 00:27:22,519
ever so often craving for the flower

602
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:24,319
just you know I [ __ ] gonna jump into

603
00:27:22,519 --> 00:27:26,240
this one I take fat dab you guys my

604
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:27,980
knees hurt my knees hurt he does river

605
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,420
near me and hear me bend over or crouch

606
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:31,039
down my knee sound like shotgun you

607
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:32,750
can't be as tall as we are and not have

608
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:34,039
any issues yeah I think so I think

609
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:35,599
that's true cuz my knees get wobbly

610
00:27:34,039 --> 00:27:37,869
sometimes when I'm tired like they just

611
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:40,549
get like shaky and my hips hurt and then

612
00:27:37,869 --> 00:27:42,169
I've got some stomach issues and not a

613
00:27:40,549 --> 00:27:43,909
lot of but my stomach sucks I've got

614
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:47,120
some stomach problems but so I take fat

615
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:49,100
fat dabs you guys I take some more

616
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:50,959
between 0.3 and 0.5 I like to smoke

617
00:27:49,099 --> 00:27:53,750
about a gram and a half a hash a day I

618
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:55,309
do that in about three sessions

619
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:57,619
throughout the day I'll take about one

620
00:27:55,309 --> 00:27:59,119
dab in the morning right one like not

621
00:27:57,619 --> 00:28:00,919
right when I get up and get myself like

622
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:02,359
get up get the morning shower and get

623
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:04,279
dressed right before I leave I'll take

624
00:28:02,359 --> 00:28:05,719
one dab just so that I'm kind of crispy

625
00:28:04,279 --> 00:28:08,629
when I'm getting where I'm going at

626
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:10,789
lunch time I may get a little dab like

627
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:12,710
about a point three and then do it bro

628
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:13,700
take some of that CBD oil and then after

629
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:15,980
work I'll come home and take like a

630
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:17,960
point five and then before the show I

631
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:19,339
did about a point five and then later on

632
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:20,630
in the evening before bed I'll just drop

633
00:28:19,339 --> 00:28:22,699
like another point five instead of

634
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:24,650
taking thirty dabs throughout the day I

635
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:26,210
take like six or seven of them I guess

636
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:28,190
maybe three to six

637
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:31,400
DAB's throughout the day and that keeps

638
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:34,490
me well medicated it's expensive but

639
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:38,650
since I'm the I produce it myself mostly

640
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:41,240
like that part or I get it from Spence

641
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:42,769
the show but since the current Whedon

642
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:44,779
can supply us with quality hash and

643
00:28:42,769 --> 00:28:50,150
dispensaries I work at a shop that can

644
00:28:44,779 --> 00:28:51,859
supply me with quality hash I smoke a

645
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:55,480
lot and I stay well medicated I like to

646
00:28:51,859 --> 00:28:58,189
eat edibles but they hit me hard hard

647
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:59,900
yeah they hit me hard too but it's

648
00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:01,130
because you're consuming a hundred

649
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:02,570
percent of it right

650
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:04,940
is sting within your body you're not

651
00:29:02,569 --> 00:29:07,519
blowing out thirty five percent of what

652
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:10,490
you just - again right okay it takes a

653
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:12,889
little longer the rush is a little

654
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:16,250
different the way that it feels when it

655
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:18,140
starts to get into your bloodstream I

656
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:21,710
feel like it comes on slower but hits a

657
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:24,200
lot harder yeah I do too I can more of a

658
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:43,850
body feeling how did you do that did you

659
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:45,529
take some CBD oil with the email cord

660
00:29:43,849 --> 00:29:46,549
and the damn rig and the microphone in

661
00:29:45,529 --> 00:29:57,379
his face

662
00:29:46,549 --> 00:29:58,789
it looks like the pothead Olympics when

663
00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:00,380
he gets done coughing I'm gonna ask him

664
00:29:58,789 --> 00:30:03,079
about how he likes edibles and how they

665
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:05,240
work for him but don't you were talking

666
00:30:03,079 --> 00:30:05,480
earlier about how medicine just totally

667
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:08,000
uh

668
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:10,849
helps your like psychological the whole

669
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:13,369
thing is that do you need a sativa or

670
00:30:10,849 --> 00:30:15,049
does a CBD medicine get to your head a

671
00:30:13,369 --> 00:30:17,089
little bit as well when you smoke the

672
00:30:15,049 --> 00:30:21,079
Tora Bora the Tora Bora is really high

673
00:30:17,089 --> 00:30:22,419
in CBD specific okay yeah and I really

674
00:30:21,079 --> 00:30:25,039
like the Tora Bora

675
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:27,590
shout out to DNA genetics for breeding

676
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:31,319
it and shout it to the person they got

677
00:30:27,589 --> 00:30:33,039
me a cut there we go yeah

678
00:30:31,319 --> 00:30:35,849
[Music]

679
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:38,440
you can tell between different strains

680
00:30:35,849 --> 00:30:41,409
even with some that say they are the

681
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:43,240
same strain of different ways that it

682
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:47,980
affects you as you as you're ingesting

683
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:50,380
it you know some more mentally than

684
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:52,210
physically so you kind of forget about

685
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:54,190
the pain before the relief of the pain

686
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:56,529
and sometimes just the opposite

687
00:30:54,190 --> 00:31:02,590
all right tor Boras more of relief of

688
00:30:56,529 --> 00:31:05,079
the pain later on it gets you high yeah

689
00:31:02,589 --> 00:31:06,669
all right okay okay I don't smoke a lot

690
00:31:05,079 --> 00:31:08,139
of the CBD stuff you guys it doesn't do

691
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:10,360
much for me so these guys get all the

692
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:11,830
CBD products that I get I was gifted

693
00:31:10,359 --> 00:31:14,969
that hash if Doug want to dab it that

694
00:31:11,829 --> 00:31:14,970
one give him a dab of that one too Mike

695
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:34,140
was so cool that fell like it was

696
00:31:28,539 --> 00:31:37,389
burning for you guys winter is here in

697
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:38,920
the fall is certainly here in Solano yep

698
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:40,030
you need a long sleeve shirt when you

699
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:42,670
drive to work in the mornings and

700
00:31:40,029 --> 00:31:43,930
unchanged you know and speaking

701
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:46,330
medically I know we're talking about

702
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:49,410
pain yeah I love to hear what you have

703
00:31:46,329 --> 00:31:53,379
to say I'm disabled with post-traumatic

704
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:56,050
stress disorder okay and I know there's

705
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:58,510
been a lot of studies looked at I think

706
00:31:56,049 --> 00:32:02,470
that it's probably the best medicine for

707
00:31:58,509 --> 00:32:05,140
it I had been prescribed many other

708
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:06,940
things but I believe that cannabis is

709
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:10,150
probably the best thing that I've ever

710
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:12,940
had that helps me control what goes on

711
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:15,310
with that you know I I don't want it

712
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:16,420
yeah I probably got a similar thing I

713
00:32:15,309 --> 00:32:17,529
don't want to compare myself and I

714
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:18,850
probably got something I'll agree with

715
00:32:17,529 --> 00:32:20,019
you and if I start thinking about [ __ ]

716
00:32:18,849 --> 00:32:22,059
that I don't even want to think about I

717
00:32:20,019 --> 00:32:25,930
can make those things not happen in my

718
00:32:22,059 --> 00:32:27,069
mind it may be part of the ritual like

719
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:29,529
you were saying earlier I've just done

720
00:32:27,069 --> 00:32:30,759
grab a dad get into the internet play

721
00:32:29,529 --> 00:32:33,460
around for a minute my brain will change

722
00:32:30,759 --> 00:32:35,819
yeah yeah it's also you know for me it's

723
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:35,819
real hard

724
00:32:35,829 --> 00:32:39,038
Easter love to go over anywhere there

725
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:42,669
was lots of people it's not that way

726
00:32:39,038 --> 00:32:44,440
anymore I really have to get prepared go

727
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:46,509
to the grocery store not because I don't

728
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:49,538
know what I'm gonna get because I get

729
00:32:46,509 --> 00:32:53,169
the same thing every time but just to

730
00:32:49,538 --> 00:32:55,028
deal with with people in close quarters

731
00:32:53,169 --> 00:32:55,720
is make you nervous it just makes me

732
00:32:55,028 --> 00:32:57,579
uncomfortable

733
00:32:55,720 --> 00:33:00,220
ok would rather not do if I come up in

734
00:32:57,579 --> 00:33:02,288
the parking lots completely full you

735
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:07,569
look over in the baskets are almost all

736
00:33:02,288 --> 00:33:13,569
gone I just go back home ok even if I

737
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:21,428
really need the food a little bit and

738
00:33:13,569 --> 00:33:24,788
wait for the crowds to die now you got

739
00:33:21,429 --> 00:33:27,220
other people depending on you then you

740
00:33:24,788 --> 00:33:29,470
suck it up and you do it and sometimes

741
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:34,558
faced with those types of situations

742
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:34,558
cannabis helps me deal with them ok

743
00:33:36,119 --> 00:33:41,918
social anxiety okay alright if anybody's

744
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:43,808
listening that doesn't think that this

745
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:45,788
[ __ ] is good for PTSD because in

746
00:33:43,808 --> 00:33:48,190
Colorado we cannot get it validated as a

747
00:33:45,788 --> 00:33:50,528
no I can qualifying condition for

748
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:53,230
medical treatment or for medical use if

749
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:55,148
you guys think that that's not a reason

750
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:56,798
to use it listen to this dude this is an

751
00:33:55,148 --> 00:34:27,159
honest guy this dude is never lied to me

752
00:33:56,798 --> 00:34:28,539
I believe every single person that gave

753
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:31,119
it to me I don't know if they want to be

754
00:34:28,539 --> 00:34:32,918
mentioned they do nice work the pain is

755
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:40,389
mounting as we speak

756
00:34:32,918 --> 00:34:41,940
yes yeah that cherry flavor tucked away

757
00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:45,399
until you guys showed up

758
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:47,918
that's delicious cherries it is it's

759
00:34:45,398 --> 00:34:49,838
like a mouthful of cherries out of the

760
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:59,710
Hitman rate with the elevator drop down

761
00:34:49,838 --> 00:35:01,000
on the email because over here oh yeah

762
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:02,349
this carb cap needs to be cleaned a

763
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:10,298
little bit they get quite filthy around

764
00:35:02,349 --> 00:35:11,619
here all right was talking about you're

765
00:35:10,298 --> 00:35:13,838
talking about how it helps with the PTSD

766
00:35:11,619 --> 00:35:18,519
yeah you know and we you know the

767
00:35:13,838 --> 00:35:20,828
military was looking into it they found

768
00:35:18,518 --> 00:35:24,308
out that they didn't want to do it right

769
00:35:20,829 --> 00:35:27,480
now but I think that if you were toxin

770
00:35:24,309 --> 00:35:29,769
people that were suffering from it I

771
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:32,500
mean we see a lot of them around town

772
00:35:29,768 --> 00:35:35,078
now yeah absolutely because this is

773
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:36,518
where the help is yeah yeah oh man so

774
00:35:35,079 --> 00:35:37,750
many people are coming here and you guys

775
00:35:36,518 --> 00:35:38,949
unfortunately what I've discovered

776
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:40,778
through some conversations lately

777
00:35:38,949 --> 00:35:43,838
there's a lot of children moving here

778
00:35:40,778 --> 00:35:45,548
for CBD treatment and those people are

779
00:35:43,838 --> 00:35:47,380
falling into traps with people that

780
00:35:45,548 --> 00:35:49,389
advertise that they can give them CBD

781
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:51,160
medicine and they're not providing the

782
00:35:49,389 --> 00:35:53,199
CBD medicine unfortunately if you're

783
00:35:51,159 --> 00:35:55,210
looking for qualified legitimate CBD

784
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:57,098
medicine in Colorado somebody that can

785
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:58,630
take on a new person and provide that

786
00:35:57,099 --> 00:36:02,019
it's going to be a three-month wait

787
00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:05,410
maybe six months yeah the caregivers are

788
00:36:02,018 --> 00:36:09,250
strapped and with the new regulations

789
00:36:05,409 --> 00:36:11,318
taking effect in January I doubt many

790
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:13,539
more people will be becoming care givers

791
00:36:11,318 --> 00:36:14,798
I expect a number of caregivers in

792
00:36:13,539 --> 00:36:17,589
business now to end up not being

793
00:36:14,798 --> 00:36:20,409
caregivers sometime by the middle of

794
00:36:17,588 --> 00:36:22,599
next year the state's really looking to

795
00:36:20,409 --> 00:36:24,068
clamp down and kind of snap out that

796
00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:25,298
whole section of our industry which

797
00:36:24,068 --> 00:36:27,219
sucks for people like me and I

798
00:36:25,298 --> 00:36:29,619
absolutely that's that's depressing

799
00:36:27,219 --> 00:36:31,000
right myself if there's a lot of new

800
00:36:29,619 --> 00:36:32,680
rules coming down the pipe that are

801
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,018
gonna make it incredibly difficult for

802
00:36:32,679 --> 00:36:37,480
people to produce the amount of meds

803
00:36:35,018 --> 00:36:39,219
they need for their patients yeah and

804
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:41,250
that's been that's by design so they

805
00:36:39,219 --> 00:36:44,449
want everybody buying from the stores

806
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:46,849
and we're gonna see Walmart

807
00:36:44,449 --> 00:36:48,108
stores in the future right yep like we

808
00:36:46,849 --> 00:36:50,510
talked about earlier I'm already having

809
00:36:48,108 --> 00:36:51,469
to source other chatter to get you guys

810
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:53,000
supplied in your shattered glass

811
00:36:51,469 --> 00:36:54,319
everybody stepped up I don't know if it

812
00:36:53,000 --> 00:37:01,159
was a good idea for me to step everybody

813
00:36:54,320 --> 00:37:03,050
up to shatter I'm not complaining but

814
00:37:01,159 --> 00:37:06,049
between the three of us we clean out the

815
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:08,599
garden that I grow yeah and other people

00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:10,849
that I know are everybody's looking

817
00:37:08,599 --> 00:37:13,280
towards concentrates right because it's

818
00:37:10,849 --> 00:37:15,140
more convenient and it works better all

819
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:17,599
the way around it's just a better

820
00:37:15,139 --> 00:37:19,789
product right for me it's the time saver

821
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:22,760
is what I've been enjoying lately yeah

822
00:37:19,789 --> 00:37:24,739
if my day is full my hours are very very

823
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:28,040
well allocated I don't have extra time

824
00:37:24,739 --> 00:37:29,509
to grind up some bud pack a bowl sit

825
00:37:28,039 --> 00:37:31,759
there and puff on it for a little while

826
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:34,460
I just don't have that kind of time

827
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:36,320
anymore right yep and a quick dab gets

828
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:47,960

829
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:49,430

830
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,568

say Mike has a mountain Dew with him

837
00:37:58,849 --> 00:38:07,609
Mike probably has six to twelve Mountain

838
00:38:01,699 --> 00:38:11,889
Dew some people carry like their

839

862
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:16,039
products are gonna be leaving store

863
00:39:12,289 --> 00:39:18,289
shelves and coming back in ten milligram

864
00:39:16,039 --> 00:39:26,539
maximum containers which sucks I like

865
00:39:18,289 --> 00:39:28,070
the drinks I forget how spoiled I am

866
00:39:26,539 --> 00:39:29,900
being a medical patient being able to

867
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:33,140
walk into a shop and get a drink with a

868
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:34,579
hundred milligrams on the REC side you

869
00:39:33,139 --> 00:39:36,889
guys have to put 10 milligrams in them

870
00:39:34,579 --> 00:39:38,389
and drink 10 of them that's coming you

871
00:39:36,889 --> 00:39:40,489
can get a hundred milligram drink right

872
00:39:38,389 --> 00:39:42,109
now but they're taking that away if you

873
00:39:40,489 --> 00:39:45,409
can't carry the snap it's got to be in a

874
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:48,320
10 milligram package period so if you

875
00:39:45,409 --> 00:39:50,239
can't snap your [ __ ] no more I mean you

876
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:52,430
can't snap liquids periods two liquids

877
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:53,929
popcorns granolas that kind of things

878
00:39:52,429 --> 00:40:03,889
got to come to ten milligrams are

879
00:39:53,929 --> 00:40:12,909
actually going to the teacher can see it

880
00:40:03,889 --> 00:40:15,259
from across the room everybody why it

881
00:40:12,909 --> 00:40:16,909
shouldn't be parenting should we focus

882
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:19,390
on parenting instead of labeling a

883
00:40:16,909 --> 00:40:22,429
[ __ ] up analogy that I came up with is

884
00:40:19,389 --> 00:40:32,269
we we put a special symbol on the fake

885
00:40:22,429 --> 00:40:37,940
guns not the real ones with the orange

886
00:40:32,269 --> 00:40:40,070
knob on the [ __ ] front of it just so

887
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:43,039
you know this is a gun gun and not like

888
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:44,420
a look-alike gun or a squirt gun I wish

889
00:40:43,039 --> 00:40:48,590
somebody could have seen me pressing my

890
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:50,389
for microphone in in retardation but now

891
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:52,809
that all the pot cookies have to carry a

892
00:40:50,389 --> 00:40:55,549
special [ __ ] warning symbol because

893
00:40:52,809 --> 00:40:58,190
people that have never been in a

894
00:40:55,550 --> 00:41:00,350
marijuana shop are convinced that they

895
00:40:58,190 --> 00:41:02,179
look just like Chips Ahoy oh yeah and

896
00:41:00,349 --> 00:41:04,369
that they're gonna be a party one day in

897
00:41:02,179 --> 00:41:06,469
one of us is gonna change out the real

898
00:41:04,369 --> 00:41:26,779
Chips Ahoy for the medicated chips of

899
00:41:06,469 --> 00:41:30,709
Hawaii we had two questions for you the

900
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:31,820
Halloween decorations at the spot I was

901
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:34,190
like do you guys really think that

902
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:35,690
somebody's gonna give out some candy

903
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:38,210
this year it might kind of beat me to it

904
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:42,050
so yeah last year though they're gonna

905
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:45,230
eat yeah the two big groups in the state

906
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:47,500
like took out billboards with edibles

907
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:50,210
out of their packaging next to candy

908
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:51,889
edible treats that they look similar to

909
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:54,679
I was like if you can't tell the

910
00:41:51,889 --> 00:41:56,329
difference how were your kids and not a

911
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:58,190
whole bunch of people in this state were

912
00:41:56,329 --> 00:42:00,769
convinced that the day after Halloween

913
00:41:58,190 --> 00:42:04,010
like the ers would just be full of kids

914
00:42:00,769 --> 00:42:05,360
that were just high yet it didn't happen

915
00:42:04,010 --> 00:42:07,100
and it didn't happen for a lot of

916
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:08,840
reasons mostly because it's the dumbest

917
00:42:07,099 --> 00:42:12,829
crime ever right like there are so many

918
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:15,440
better ways to get a felony you can't

919
00:42:12,829 --> 00:42:17,779
hand out dirty candy on Halloween and

920
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:19,579
have like that leads right back to you

921
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:20,960
and there's no payoff for the criminal

922
00:42:19,579 --> 00:42:23,420
that's right you got about three hours

923
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:25,639
worth a sick [ __ ] that likes to hurt

924
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:29,360
kids like doesn't like to hurt kids in

925
00:42:25,639 --> 00:42:31,519
theory and it was expensive right 25

926
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:33,470
bucks a [ __ ] piece like who's got

927
00:42:31,519 --> 00:42:36,289
that kind of money to get local kids

928
00:42:33,469 --> 00:42:38,569
stoned right I'm gonna eat them all if

929
00:42:36,289 --> 00:42:39,949
you guys think that you have candy that

930
00:42:38,570 --> 00:42:41,870
your kids got on Halloween and you

931
00:42:39,949 --> 00:42:45,529

932
00:42:41,869 --> 00:42:47,659
cannabis you can send it right to me my

933

940
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:03,410
I'll tell you if that [ __ ] hasn't

941
00:43:00,739 --> 00:43:04,819
medicated cannabis in it we'll see we'll

942
00:43:03,409 --> 00:43:07,339
see if that's if it's medicated with

943
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:08,369
with THC it's always it's always the

944
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:10,950
scare tactic about

945
00:43:08,369 --> 00:43:13,380
children you know when I was a child and

946
00:43:10,949 --> 00:43:16,348
went trick-or-treating people gave out

947
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:18,298
popcorn balls and fruit then then one

948
00:43:16,349 --> 00:43:20,430
year there was a massive scare that

949
00:43:18,298 --> 00:43:22,829
someone was putting razor blades in

950
00:43:20,429 --> 00:43:25,348
those fruits and other things in your

951
00:43:22,829 --> 00:43:27,119
cookies then all of a sudden he couldn't

952
00:43:25,349 --> 00:43:29,519
take grandma's treats anymore they had

953
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:32,430
to go buy them from the store and they

954
00:43:29,518 --> 00:43:39,508
had to be packaged and Mars company

955
00:43:32,429 --> 00:43:41,969
loved it oh yeah the best marketing

956
00:43:39,509 --> 00:43:44,219
campaign Mars can ever come up with

957
00:43:41,969 --> 00:43:54,088
that's almost too smart just for a

958
00:43:44,219 --> 00:43:56,730
corporation I'm the type of [ __ ] who

959
00:43:54,088 --> 00:44:03,268
spent four hours on the internet looking

960
00:43:56,730 --> 00:44:09,778
for cases three times more family

961
00:44:03,268 --> 00:44:11,489
members it's not funny but it's really

962
00:44:09,778 --> 00:44:13,889
funny because if when you think that the

963
00:44:11,489 --> 00:44:16,229
links we've gone to as a nation to like

964
00:44:13,889 --> 00:44:17,848
every nice old lady that's ever tried to

965
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:20,309
make sugar cookies with all the kids

966
00:44:17,849 --> 00:44:22,019
that come by and then like three hours

967
00:44:20,309 --> 00:44:23,640
into Halloween they realize that their

968
00:44:22,018 --> 00:44:25,439
[ __ ] sidewalks covered with sugar

969
00:44:23,639 --> 00:44:28,409
cookies and all the parents think

970
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:30,059
they're insane because they just happen

971
00:44:28,409 --> 00:44:32,338
to miss that part of their our mass

972
00:44:30,059 --> 00:44:34,200
education against taking delicious

973
00:44:32,338 --> 00:44:36,268
treats from people on Halloween I need a

974

00:47:51,769 --> 00:48:15,860
found him on the down-low so lately you

1027
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,000
guys a hot topic has been and we're just

1028
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:18,380
gonna go on this one for a couple of

1029
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,699
seconds cuz I wrote it down and I just

1030
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:21,740
want to be able to cross it off because

1031
00:48:19,699 --> 00:48:24,169
I'm a completionist how do you guys feel

1032
00:48:21,739 --> 00:48:26,659
about professional athletes being able

1033
00:48:24,170 --> 00:48:28,670
to use marijuana first in their on

1034
00:48:26,659 --> 00:48:30,170
season and also in their offseason it's

1035
00:48:28,670 --> 00:48:31,460
two different subjects you're on the

1036
00:48:30,170 --> 00:48:32,539
clock and not off the clock i think when

1037
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:33,740
you're with the team they kind of own

1038
00:48:32,539 --> 00:48:35,659
you so we have to make two separate

1039
00:48:33,739 --> 00:48:36,619
separate subjects then i say that wrong

1040
00:48:35,659 --> 00:48:42,619
is i'm not good to say you don't look

1041
00:48:36,619 --> 00:48:44,719
like it really depends on your take on

1042
00:48:42,619 --> 00:48:48,920
just you always be careful with that

1043
00:48:44,719 --> 00:48:54,469
particular verbage in this case you're

1044
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:57,230
not totally in the wrong they live under

1045
00:48:54,469 --> 00:49:00,319
some pretty insane [ __ ] regiment

1046
00:48:57,230 --> 00:49:00,320
[Music]

1047
00:49:03,610 --> 00:49:06,659
[Music]

1048
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:11,659
alright you're on the clock basically

1049
00:49:10,099 --> 00:49:12,920
during the on season the whole season

1050
00:49:11,659 --> 00:49:14,869
from the time season starts from

1051
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:16,369
whatever preseason training times bring

1052
00:49:14,869 --> 00:49:18,109
whatever spring training when it starts

1053
00:49:16,369 --> 00:49:19,519
you're on the clock until that Super

1054
00:49:18,110 --> 00:49:22,700
Bowl or whatever your team is [ __ ]

1055
00:49:19,519 --> 00:49:24,739
finished / you fail or win right you're

1056
00:49:22,699 --> 00:49:28,369
on the clock so should you be able to

1057
00:49:24,739 --> 00:49:30,500
use cannabis to alleviate your pains or

1058
00:49:28,369 --> 00:49:32,000
for whatever reason [ __ ] it's a it's

1059
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:34,190
a recreational state

1060
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:38,030
janeiro protecting research coming out

1061
00:49:34,190 --> 00:49:40,760
that's really promising it might really

1062
00:49:38,030 --> 00:49:44,510
help deal with concussions brain

1063
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:46,910
injuries that kind of thing really yeah

1064
00:49:44,510 --> 00:49:49,160
it might be [ __ ] helpful from the

1065
00:49:46,909 --> 00:49:54,199
only get bashed in the face rugby

1066
00:49:49,159 --> 00:49:56,210
players boxers right now so you feel

1067
00:49:54,199 --> 00:49:59,179
that on their offseason is what I'm

1068
00:49:56,210 --> 00:50:02,329
asking about now you to consume cannabis

1069
00:49:59,179 --> 00:50:04,339
medical or recreational officer on there

1070
00:50:02,329 --> 00:50:05,659
during the off-season as much as they

1071
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:07,789
brought as much as they'd like right

1072
00:50:05,659 --> 00:50:10,429
they can they can drink alcohol only

1073
00:50:07,789 --> 00:50:23,329
takes in color okay in any state there

1074
00:50:10,429 --> 00:50:26,000
are adults in all three states also do

1075
00:50:23,329 --> 00:50:27,739
you think that these guys ask about

1076
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,150
specific sports after I generalize we'll

1077
00:50:27,739 --> 00:50:30,649
just we'll kind of narrow it down do you

1078
00:50:29,150 --> 00:50:32,869
think that professional athletes should

1079
00:50:30,650 --> 00:50:34,849
be able to consume cannabis on during

1080
00:50:32,869 --> 00:50:38,409
the on season like the night after a

1081
00:50:34,849 --> 00:50:40,819
game maybe the day before a game maybe

1082
00:50:38,409 --> 00:50:48,559
you're a better player when you smoke a

1083
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:50,059
joint but how many other

1084
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:59,150
performance-enhancing drugs are those

1085
00:50:50,059 --> 00:51:01,549
other football players using legitimate

1086
00:50:59,150 --> 00:51:04,160
testing people as though it's steroids

1087
00:51:01,550 --> 00:51:06,920
right when they're looking for steroids

1088
00:51:04,159 --> 00:51:10,279
they also look for pot is though they're

1089
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:12,320
the same and that's nuts like the best

1090
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:14,120
it's helping you focus on keeping you

1091
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:16,309
from being in pain while you you know

1092
00:51:14,119 --> 00:51:32,630
what I mean it's not making you stronger

1093
00:51:16,309 --> 00:51:34,519
fast there are a lot of people who do

1094
00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:36,320
[ __ ] well that's one thing about sports

1095
00:51:34,519 --> 00:51:38,480
like football players crash into other

1096
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:39,950
people with highest bodies yeah and

1097
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:41,750
there's a lot of power there like that

1098
00:51:39,949 --> 00:51:43,159
needs to be precisely controlled or

1099
00:51:41,750 --> 00:51:44,809
somebody's gonna die

1100
00:51:43,159 --> 00:51:46,309
and like I'm down for us to

1101
00:51:44,809 --> 00:51:47,599
watch people kill each other but we need

1102
00:51:46,309 --> 00:51:52,759
to give them like swords and just call

1103
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:54,289
it gladiatorial ball players intoxicated

1104
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:56,000
and letting a rush each others not how

1105
00:51:54,289 --> 00:52:18,110
we get there that's gonna be one of the

1106
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:19,639
things people tweet about sometimes yes

1107
00:52:18,110 --> 00:52:21,769
I'm politically erect

1108
00:52:19,639 --> 00:52:24,589
well everything means eleven things yes

1109
00:52:21,769 --> 00:52:26,090
exactly all right so we all think that

1110
00:52:24,590 --> 00:52:27,140
sports athletes the professional

1111
00:52:26,090 --> 00:52:28,130
athletes should be able to consume

1112
00:52:27,139 --> 00:52:30,019
cannabis they're allowed to drink

1113
00:52:28,130 --> 00:52:31,460
alcohol if they so choose yeah and in

1114
00:52:30,019 --> 00:52:38,989
Colorado we have pretty much put the

1115
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:40,429
same rules on booze or yeah most of us

1116
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:42,589
can go out after a hard day of whatever

1117
00:52:40,429 --> 00:52:44,389
we do and we how many how many other

1118
00:52:42,590 --> 00:52:46,579
people slam into other people all day

1119
00:52:44,389 --> 00:52:48,469
for a damn living like why can't these

1120
00:52:46,579 --> 00:52:49,940
people go smoke a little bit of reefer

1121
00:52:48,469 --> 00:52:52,609
if their buddies can smoke can drink

1122
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:55,039
some beers I can't I can't drink beer

1123
00:52:52,610 --> 00:52:56,780
beer is no good for me beer does nothing

1124
00:52:55,039 --> 00:52:58,550
good for me but smoking cannabis I have

1125
00:52:56,780 --> 00:53:00,470
plenty of medicinal value and plenty of

1126
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:02,180
benefits yep so I don't go drink beer

1127
00:53:00,469 --> 00:53:03,379
after work like several people doing I'm

1128
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:03,799
not judging I'm saying that doesn't work

1129
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:05,030
for me

1130
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:07,280
yeah I come home and smoke some weed

1131
00:53:05,030 --> 00:53:08,960
smoke some dad's it works wonderfully we

1132
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:10,690
should have an alternative yep great

1133
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:13,130
yeah completely

1134
00:53:10,690 --> 00:53:15,740
excellent so he didn't have to be

1135
00:53:13,130 --> 00:53:20,510
confined

1136
00:53:15,739 --> 00:53:24,409
two places where you can't be seen

1137
00:53:20,510 --> 00:53:27,230
absolutely where you have to hide adults

1138
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:31,460
like to gather and enjoy in toxicants

1139
00:53:27,230 --> 00:53:32,900
with other adults I mean it's literally

1140
00:53:31,460 --> 00:53:35,269
this way it's always been

1141
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:37,579
you're taxing us for us or give us some

1142
00:53:35,269 --> 00:53:39,889
more to consume it the first round the

1143
00:53:37,579 --> 00:53:41,389
first fire got there like they gathered

1144
00:53:39,889 --> 00:53:48,230
to get [ __ ] up around it like that's

1145
00:53:41,389 --> 00:53:51,529
just how humans or I mean in different

1146
00:53:48,230 --> 00:53:54,320
parts of the country is the corner or in

1147
00:53:51,530 --> 00:53:57,830
many cultures where people get together

1148
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:59,539
and enjoy intoxicants and yeah having a

1149
00:53:57,829 --> 00:54:02,659
place where people can go and consume

1150
00:53:59,539 --> 00:54:05,059
pot together those are necessary we need

1151
00:54:02,659 --> 00:54:08,089
to yeah yes we sure do that would be

1152
00:54:05,059 --> 00:54:09,380

1153
00:54:08,090 --> 00:54:12,800

00:54:22,909 --> 00:54:29,319
have with alcohol consumption facilities

1161
00:54:25,510 --> 00:54:29,320

a little better without oh yeah it's

1256
00:58:03,150 --> 00:58:07,318
smoking so much simpler because you can

bed and then hopefully you're sleeping

1268
00:58:26,909 --> 00:58:29,308
and those edibles will kick in while

1269
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:31,500
you're sleeping and keep you asleep

1270
00:58:29,309 --> 00:58:33,510
through the night that's what I've been

1271
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:35,639
doing with edibles all summer long yes

1272

twenty eleven and they're kicking in for

1276
00:58:45,028 --> 00:58:55,048
the first few hours of my sweet feeling

1277
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:57,659
great so let's quickly we've talked

1278
00:58:55,048 --> 00:58:59,518
about dabs and smoking dabs and flowers

1279
00:58:57,659 --> 00:59:02,250
we've talked about edibles we talked

1280
00:58:59,518 --> 00:59:04,139
about teachers we talked about your vape

1281
00:59:02,250 --> 00:59:06,268
pen there we've kind of left out like

1282
00:59:04,139 --> 00:59:08,009
rubs and creams is all I think that's

1283
00:59:06,268 --> 00:59:09,328
left and I've got one other product that

1284
00:59:08,009 --> 00:59:11,219
we can talk about if we have a couple

1285
00:59:09,329 --> 00:59:12,630
seconds but you look like you got

1286
00:59:11,219 --> 00:59:15,088
something to say about no I'm when you

1287
00:59:12,630 --> 00:59:17,579
said rubs and creams I've talked to some

1288
00:59:15,088 --> 00:59:20,849
people in my age bracket that are using

1289
00:59:17,579 --> 00:59:23,130
some of the cranes for arthritis and and

1290
00:59:20,849 --> 00:59:25,980
swear by I'm thinking it's the best

1291
00:59:23,130 --> 00:59:27,900
thing since sliced bread I did not take

1292
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:30,028
them seriously and then a friend of mine

1293
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:32,130
gave me a bottle as a sample and I gave

1294
00:59:30,028 --> 00:59:33,809
somebody a massage just from the

1295
00:59:32,130 --> 00:59:38,278
shoulders to the mid back is all she let

1296
00:59:33,809 --> 00:59:41,220
me do but by then my fingers felt fluffy

1297
00:59:38,278 --> 00:59:42,869
like I was wearing balloon gloves so now

1298
00:59:41,219 --> 00:59:44,759
I take it seriously she was like wow

1299
00:59:42,869 --> 00:59:46,410
that was like a huge massage I was like

1300
00:59:44,759 --> 00:59:48,358
it's that Apothic and it was Apothic and

1301
00:59:46,409 --> 00:59:49,889
a pain cream is what I used and it I

1302
00:59:48,358 --> 00:59:52,319
definitely give the pain

1303
00:59:49,889 --> 00:59:54,299
and saps credit no I did not before but

1304
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:56,670
after that I believe I'm a believer yeah

1305
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:58,680
yeah I had one of the it was one of the

1306
00:59:56,670 --> 01:00:00,750
first generation topical lotions in

1307
00:59:58,679 --> 01:00:02,250
Colorado just just random lotion in a

1308
01:00:00,750 --> 01:00:04,409
bottle with like a company stick around

1309
01:00:02,250 --> 01:00:06,119
I don't remember what the brand was but

1310
01:00:04,409 --> 01:00:08,190
I use it for after trimming to help

1311
01:00:06,119 --> 01:00:09,659
absorb the rest of the trichomes off my

1312
01:00:08,190 --> 01:00:11,849
skin that I couldn't get washed off

1313
01:00:09,659 --> 01:00:13,349
gonna work wonderful for that but it

1314
01:00:11,849 --> 01:00:16,049
would also help ease the pain from

1315
01:00:13,349 --> 01:00:18,480
trimming Wow I mean you spend seven

1316
01:00:16,050 --> 01:00:20,610
eight hours is room like a madman your

1317
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:22,650
fingers cramp up one hands holding a

1318
01:00:20,610 --> 01:00:24,000
little stem all night all day and the

1319
01:00:22,650 --> 01:00:26,340
other ones working a pair of scissors

1320
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:28,199
for that whole shift it hurts yeah yeah

1321
01:00:26,340 --> 01:00:30,030
that pain cream I mean an hour after I

1322
01:00:28,199 --> 01:00:31,469
used it I felt like I hadn't been at

1323
01:00:30,030 --> 01:00:33,210
work all day it was great

1324
01:00:31,469 --> 01:00:37,529
Chad I said the ladies that trimmed my

1325
01:00:33,210 --> 01:00:39,119
weed for me the other night good job so

1326
01:00:37,530 --> 01:00:41,160
we've covered it seems like we've

1327
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:43,469
covered 90% of the consumption methods

1328
01:00:41,159 --> 01:00:45,389
have either of you guys tried Mike's had

1329
01:00:43,469 --> 01:00:48,389
some teas but those work they have any

1330
01:00:45,389 --> 01:00:51,179
medicinal value the tea's that I was

1331
01:00:48,389 --> 01:00:54,059
really into on most of that I mean the

1332
01:00:51,179 --> 01:00:56,399
dose was so low and the quality was so

1333
01:00:54,059 --> 01:00:57,960
sketchy back then that it was probably

1334
01:00:56,400 --> 01:01:00,329
just a good flavor to you that I liked

1335
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:02,369
paying five dollars a bag for it okay um

1336
01:01:00,329 --> 01:01:04,559
but there's a couple of teas on the

1337
01:01:02,369 --> 01:01:05,309
market that people swear by I haven't

1338
01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:07,170
tried them yet

1339
01:01:05,309 --> 01:01:09,779
I'm still working my way down the Edible

1340
01:01:07,170 --> 01:01:11,670
case nice how about a transdermal patch

1341
01:01:09,780 --> 01:01:14,940
have you tried one of those yet I have a

1342
01:01:11,670 --> 01:01:18,210
friend who did in an effort to treat

1343
01:01:14,940 --> 01:01:19,860
fibromyalgia with the CBD patch and she

1344
01:01:18,210 --> 01:01:22,530
said it worked but not as well as

1345
01:01:19,860 --> 01:01:25,410
smoking okay and she really likes uh

1346
01:01:22,530 --> 01:01:28,760
she's got a CBD oil cartridge for her

1347
01:01:25,409 --> 01:01:31,889
vape pen that she really really likes

1348
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:37,320
suffer from fibromyalgia myself used to

1349
01:01:31,889 --> 01:01:38,969
be on lyrica okay yeah about 9,000 side

1350
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:40,890
effects on the commercials yeah yeah

1351
01:01:38,969 --> 01:01:44,449
okay they're all smiling and talking

1352
01:01:40,889 --> 01:01:44,449
about anal drainage and stuff

1353
01:01:44,750 --> 01:01:51,469
but then again this is one of the drugs

1354
01:01:48,199 --> 01:01:56,359
that I got rid of excellent once started

1355
01:01:51,469 --> 01:02:06,339
using the on a regular basis myself and

1356
01:01:56,360 --> 01:02:06,340
the good yes sir well thank is gone yeah

1357
01:02:08,570 --> 01:02:32,360
[Music]

1358
01:02:10,719 --> 01:02:39,289
holy [ __ ] you know you can find your

1359
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:40,849
phone because you've got energy again

1360
01:02:39,289 --> 01:03:02,239
there you go you know you've got

1361
01:02:40,849 --> 01:03:05,210
mobility again see the look on a part

1362
01:03:02,239 --> 01:03:07,369
it's not just like when my knees really

1363
01:03:05,210 --> 01:03:09,889
start throbbing it's not just the knee

1364
01:03:07,369 --> 01:03:12,019
is the muscles on either side of it

1365
01:03:09,889 --> 01:03:13,879
pence up trying to protect it huh

1366
01:03:12,019 --> 01:03:16,090
and then you walk a little funny trying

1367
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:18,769
to protect by the end of the day

1368
01:03:16,090 --> 01:03:21,079
everything below your nipples is sore

1369
01:03:18,769 --> 01:03:23,929
because it's trying to keep your knee

1370
01:03:21,079 --> 01:03:26,059
from being really sore right and then

1371
01:03:23,929 --> 01:03:28,429
living like that for weeks and months on

1372
01:03:26,059 --> 01:03:30,469
and you just become exhausted and after

1373
01:03:28,429 --> 01:03:32,119
years you start walking different you

1374
01:03:30,469 --> 01:03:35,179
just are you know there being different

1375
01:03:32,119 --> 01:03:36,889
it affects you oh great yeah and when

1376
01:03:35,179 --> 01:03:40,159
you can't think of anything else except

1377
01:03:36,889 --> 01:03:42,170
pain when it's like a high note right

1378
01:03:40,159 --> 01:03:45,170
between your ears and that's all that

1379
01:03:42,170 --> 01:03:47,930
you can do is hear that scream that your

1380
01:03:45,170 --> 01:03:50,920
mind is giving hey we're hurt yeah you

1381
01:03:47,929 --> 01:03:50,919
know do something

1382
01:03:51,030 --> 01:03:55,300
sometimes she changes it up not enough

1383
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:56,889
you can do at that point right sometimes

1384
01:03:55,300 --> 01:04:00,550
it's just you know sometimes it's just

1385
01:03:56,889 --> 01:04:02,799
with that curl up and invite the bullet

1386
01:04:00,550 --> 01:04:03,370
until something you can do to give some

1387
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:06,100
relief

1388
01:04:03,369 --> 01:04:09,460
you know sometimes heat sometimes cold

1389
01:04:06,099 --> 01:04:13,119
but sometimes pharmaceutical medicine so

1390
01:04:09,460 --> 01:04:16,389
many people go to alcohol for though you

1391
01:04:13,119 --> 01:04:18,130
know what we've seen since the beginning

1392
01:04:16,389 --> 01:04:20,170
of alcohol right yeah

1393
01:04:18,130 --> 01:04:22,480
people of always I remember my

1394
01:04:20,170 --> 01:04:23,829
grandparents we would talk about they

1395
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:26,679
take their shot and go that's our

1396
01:04:23,829 --> 01:04:30,190
medicine for the night at the end of

1397
01:04:26,679 --> 01:04:32,230
their lives however they wish that at

1398
01:04:30,190 --> 01:04:34,030
least that's what they told me was that

1399
01:04:32,230 --> 01:04:36,039
they wish they had quit that earlier and

1400
01:04:34,030 --> 01:04:37,930
yeah yeah and that's one of the reasons

1401
01:04:36,039 --> 01:04:53,920
I stopped earlier in my life I'm glad

1402
01:04:37,929 --> 01:04:58,299
you did I'm sure that we don't yes

1403
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:59,710
absolutely every day so there's one more

1404
01:04:58,300 --> 01:05:00,880
way of consumption that I can think of

1405
01:04:59,710 --> 01:05:09,730
that we have not talked about that I

1406
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:13,420
have tried to spend three and I got some

1407
01:05:09,730 --> 01:05:16,210
dude it's called Evo's I believe there's

1408
01:05:13,420 --> 01:05:20,059
a couple different companies Lauria make

1409
01:05:16,210 --> 01:05:22,139
it aureus the main one and then we carry

1410
01:05:20,059 --> 01:05:25,929
[Music]

1411
01:05:22,139 --> 01:05:30,519
I didn't get high at all from it but

1412
01:05:25,929 --> 01:05:32,739
yeah that's the nice thing about

1413
01:05:30,519 --> 01:05:34,989
topicals is there's not an intoxication

1414
01:05:32,739 --> 01:05:36,969
with them right it's just a medical

1415
01:05:34,989 --> 01:05:40,179
effect so the instructions said like

1416
01:05:36,969 --> 01:05:45,129
spray three to four sprays on her so I

1417
01:05:40,179 --> 01:05:46,480
was like eight because you know it

1418
01:05:45,130 --> 01:05:48,309
wasn't spraying that much I just like

1419
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:50,289
spraying it on there and then it totally

1420
01:05:48,309 --> 01:05:54,190
had sex with this chicken it felt warm

1421
01:05:50,289 --> 01:05:56,139
and tingly and like hot it was like

1422
01:05:54,190 --> 01:05:59,440
hotter than normal like the temperature

1423
01:05:56,139 --> 01:06:01,059
was higher and it took a little more

1424
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:03,659
effort to finish up to tell you the

1425
01:06:01,059 --> 01:06:06,279
truth like you had to like wrap it up

1426
01:06:03,659 --> 01:06:08,649
did a big review of this in a previous

1427
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:10,089
show yeah we kind of did but we also did

1428
01:06:08,650 --> 01:06:11,769
a review of what happens when I smoke

1429
01:06:10,088 --> 01:06:18,880
too much CBD and I can't finish up and

1430
01:06:11,769 --> 01:06:23,199
we talked about that as well infuse it

1431
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:24,670
with THD put coconut oil throw a bunch

1432
01:06:23,199 --> 01:06:26,828
of bun there and then straighten out the

1433
01:06:24,670 --> 01:06:29,019
bud what I really think they do would

1434
01:06:26,829 --> 01:06:46,960
not be surprised to find that that's the

1435
01:06:29,019 --> 01:06:49,599
recipe goods you can't get the resin off

1436
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:52,960
your hands from trimming take that [ __ ]

1437
01:06:49,599 --> 01:06:54,068
right off real quick that's the first

1438
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:57,490
one I'll tell you about some of the

1439
01:06:54,068 --> 01:06:58,719
other ones you know all right wrapping

1440
01:06:57,489 --> 01:07:00,669
up the show I try to do it earlier but

1441
01:06:58,719 --> 01:07:02,739
we've got so much [ __ ] to say I think

1442
01:07:00,670 --> 01:07:05,619
we've covered all ways that I'm familiar

1443
01:07:02,739 --> 01:07:09,358
with consuming cannabis we did touch on

1444
01:07:05,619 --> 01:07:11,950
on children about people coming here a

1445
01:07:09,358 --> 01:07:13,960
little bit yeah you just like to make a

1446
01:07:11,949 --> 01:07:16,989
quick point because I I know someone who

1447
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:19,710
has a special needs child seizures

1448
01:07:16,989 --> 01:07:24,009
multiple times throughout the day

1449
01:07:19,710 --> 01:07:27,519
finally was able to get medication great

1450
01:07:24,010 --> 01:07:30,430
and has changed their life yeah 180

1451
01:07:27,519 --> 01:07:32,380
degrees around good I mean if you don't

1452
01:07:30,429 --> 01:07:34,750
believe in this stuff you need to come

1453
01:07:32,380 --> 01:07:36,789

01:08:19,259 --> 01:08:25,079
of places we or Jeff talked about a news

1472
01:08:22,079 --> 01:08:28,559
article recently there's hemp extract

1473
01:08:25,079 --> 01:08:30,210

1475
01:08:30,210 --> 01:08:36,569
it's not the real thing if you can get

01:08:34,170 --> 01:08:38,548
it outside of a dispensary you have to

1477
01:08:36,569 --> 01:08:40,289
be standing in in Colorado there's a

1478
01:08:38,548 --> 01:08:43,469
50/50 chance it's not the real thing

1479
01:08:40,289 --> 01:08:45,179
that's the truth if you're lucky and you

1480
01:08:43,469 --> 01:08:48,659
live in another state that has a really

1481

solid medical marijuana program and lab

1482
01:08:48,659 --> 01:08:53,818
testing for cannabinoids is required you

1483
01:08:52,198 --> 01:08:56,219
should be able to get the lab tests

right there with your product you can

1485
01:08:56,219 --> 01:09:00,119
check and see what you're buying right

1486
01:08:57,630 --> 01:09:01,588

stuff from a store that doesn't come

1489
01:09:03,390 --> 01:09:08,910
with that that should be now with

1490
01:09:06,869 --> 01:09:11,809
legalization in Colorado if they don't

1491
01:09:08,909 --> 01:09:13,979
have a lab test they're full of [ __ ]

1492
01:09:11,810 --> 01:09:15,600
it's it's just that simple

1493
01:09:13,979 --> 01:09:17,849
yeah he's right he's telling the truth

1494
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:20,039
um if it's legal product in Colorado you

1495
01:09:17,850 --> 01:09:21,270
have to have it lab tested if the store

1496
01:09:20,039 --> 01:09:23,399
clerk tells you they don't have the lab

1497
01:09:21,270 --> 01:09:26,870
test they're lying yeah they just want

1498
01:09:23,399 --> 01:09:26,869
you to see something they don't want to

being lazy and don't want to grab it but

yeah it's it's standard information now

in a range of ratios with THC anywhere

1504
01:09:41,579 --> 01:09:49,789
from like a hundred to one CBD to THC to

jito and before they finished the name

1792
01:29:18,149 --> 01:29:23,089

1793
01:29:20,100 --> 01:29:25,130
air and I looked at my friend it was

1794

[Music]

1795
01:29:25,130 --> 01:29:31,800

1796
01:29:30,149 --> 01:29:33,089
us like they said it and I only kept

1797
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:34,170
like saying it over and over and get in

1798
01:29:33,090 --> 01:29:36,810
my head but Spencer was like Maddie

1799
01:29:34,170 --> 01:29:38,670
let's go in like my friends all started

1800
01:29:36,810 --> 01:29:40,199
brushing up on the stage with us that

1801
01:29:38,670 --> 01:29:43,429
was the best part is everyone was on

1802
01:29:40,198 --> 01:29:45,629
stage I was in the back taking pictures

1803
01:29:43,429 --> 01:29:47,819
I'm proud of you so good job good job

1804
01:29:45,630 --> 01:29:48,869
there's another cannabis cup coming up

1805
01:29:47,819 --> 01:29:51,599
in the future do you guys have anything

1806
01:29:48,869 --> 01:29:52,948
planned for that which one Oh which one

1807
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:57,239
well it's all I was thinking about

1808
01:29:52,948 --> 01:29:59,039
Denver but a family just got canceled if

1809
01:29:57,238 --> 01:30:02,638
we're lucky enough to have a cuppa

1810
01:29:59,039 --> 01:30:04,109
Denver I'll do it just with the way

1811
01:30:02,639 --> 01:30:07,440
everything's going I don't think that's

1812
01:30:04,109 --> 01:30:09,538
gonna last much longer that's true it's

1813
01:30:07,439 --> 01:30:12,118
like in

1814
01:30:09,538 --> 01:30:13,500
like I know like Jamaica that'll be fine

1815
01:30:12,118 --> 01:30:18,899
they're not gonna touch to me because

1816
01:30:13,500 --> 01:30:21,359
it's in a different country first time I

1817
01:30:18,899 --> 01:30:24,058
think Michigan I was looking on the

1818
01:30:21,359 --> 01:30:25,979
website today and Michigan has either

1819
01:30:24,059 --> 01:30:30,449
Michigan you know its California the one

1820
01:30:25,979 --> 01:30:33,988
in LA that they'd February very you Mike

1821
01:30:30,448 --> 01:30:35,729
um is going to have a two weekend so

1822
01:30:33,988 --> 01:30:37,678
it's gonna be one weekend and then like

1823
01:30:35,729 --> 01:30:39,299
I don't know what they're doing the

1824
01:30:37,679 --> 01:30:41,760
entire week and then the next weekend

1825
01:30:39,300 --> 01:30:43,409
it's like so you know things are

1826
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:47,429
changing with like different states

1827
01:30:43,408 --> 01:30:50,308
trying to low high times I think it just

1828
01:30:47,429 --> 01:30:51,389
comes down to it like probably how much

1829
01:30:50,309 --> 01:30:53,029
money you want to put into it which

1830
01:30:51,389 --> 01:30:55,078
they're probably still paying a

1831
01:30:53,029 --> 01:30:58,469
ridiculous amount to you know get

1832
01:30:55,078 --> 01:30:59,969
locations and stuff just when you know

1833
01:30:58,469 --> 01:31:01,800
at cannabis cups it's usually like

1834
01:30:59,969 --> 01:31:04,559
people giving away samples and stuff

1835
01:31:01,800 --> 01:31:13,159
like that like that's money that the tax

1836
01:31:04,559 --> 01:31:16,788
people don't see so that's like that

1837
01:31:13,158 --> 01:31:19,649
nobody can give out samples or only

1838
01:31:16,788 --> 01:31:21,840
established shops with licenses can't

1839
01:31:19,649 --> 01:31:23,129
give out samples the problem is when the

1840
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:25,739
established shops were giving out

1841
01:31:23,130 --> 01:31:30,449
licenses but I heard a police officer

1842
01:31:25,738 --> 01:31:31,859
say that he said shops given out license

1843
01:31:30,448 --> 01:31:32,729
I didn't say that huh licensed shop

1844
01:31:31,859 --> 01:31:34,229
giving out samples

1845
01:31:32,729 --> 01:31:35,399
sorry but then I wanted to talk about

1846
01:31:34,229 --> 01:31:37,589
something else that I heard I heard a

1847
01:31:35,399 --> 01:31:40,158
cop see today that if I give you

1848
01:31:37,590 --> 01:31:42,360
cannabis even if I gave it to you

1849
01:31:40,158 --> 01:31:44,848
legally that's a sale there was a

1850
01:31:42,359 --> 01:31:47,368
transaction there that was considered a

1851
01:31:44,849 --> 01:31:48,480
sale even if it's a donation so there's

1852
01:31:47,368 --> 01:31:51,420
a lot to be careful about yeah

1853
01:31:48,479 --> 01:31:52,618
technically that's a sale interesting I

1854
01:31:51,420 --> 01:31:54,840
guess that would just be at the cops

1855
01:31:52,618 --> 01:31:58,618
discretion that's exactly what that cop

1856
01:31:54,840 --> 01:32:00,989
said yep they can go ahead and arrest

1857
01:31:58,618 --> 01:32:02,488
you for me give arrest both of us me for

1858
01:32:00,988 --> 01:32:05,779
giving it's you and you for accepting it

1859
01:32:02,488 --> 01:32:10,709
even though we're both over 21

1860
01:32:05,779 --> 01:32:11,130
go ahead slop grab the microphone there

1861
01:32:10,710 --> 01:32:12,750
we go

1862
01:32:11,130 --> 01:32:14,310
what about like how does that work

1863
01:32:12,750 --> 01:32:14,760
though because we can smoke with each

1864
01:32:14,310 --> 01:32:22,080
other

1865
01:32:14,760 --> 01:32:24,360
that's very true because I mean

1866
01:32:22,079 --> 01:32:26,899
technically like the definition of a

1867
01:32:24,359 --> 01:32:32,969
sale is like Mike you're the legal guy

1868
01:32:26,899 --> 01:32:36,179
Mike I don't give direct legal advice we

1869
01:32:32,969 --> 01:32:37,890
need more Pro marijuana laws the federal

1870
01:32:36,180 --> 01:32:40,199
lot needs to change state laws need to

1871
01:32:37,890 --> 01:32:43,050
change marijuana is legal here we have

1872
01:32:40,198 --> 01:32:46,469
pot stores we still can't gather outside

1873
01:32:43,050 --> 01:32:48,630
of someone's private residence and

1874
01:32:46,469 --> 01:32:52,198
consumed together legally all of that

1875
01:32:48,630 --> 01:32:54,239
still in a gray market people are busted

1876
01:32:52,198 --> 01:32:56,069
for distribution for passing joints at

1877
01:32:54,238 --> 01:32:58,948
parties or for having more than an ounce

1878
01:32:56,069 --> 01:33:01,019
on them or for buying weed that comes in

1879
01:32:58,948 --> 01:33:02,460
multiple bags or for owning a scale so

1880
01:33:01,020 --> 01:33:05,610
that they can check their purchase after

1881
01:33:02,460 --> 01:33:07,680
they buy it the law needs to change

1882
01:33:05,609 --> 01:33:09,630
everywhere and more people need to get

1883
01:33:07,680 --> 01:33:11,280
politically active everybody here just

1884
01:33:09,630 --> 01:33:12,869

tried to take a DAB it was just

1937

1968
01:39:07,270 --> 01:39:10,840
label on their truck and then they have

1969

you can tell us just product for days on

1971
01:39:12,670 --> 01:39:16,949
the trailer a lot of times it's you have

1972
01:39:14,979 --> 01:39:19,119
to fill out a manifest before you leave

1973
01:39:16,949 --> 01:39:20,979
before the product leaves one building

1974
01:39:19,119 --> 01:39:24,789
you have to fill out a manifest of the

1975
01:39:20,979 --> 01:39:29,559
amount of product the car license plate

1976
01:39:24,789 --> 01:39:31,689
the driver you're going to take has to

1977
01:39:29,560 --> 01:39:33,789
be documented because you can't be like

1978
01:39:31,689 --> 01:39:35,649
off like if you get call it like 30

1979
01:39:33,789 --> 01:39:37,989
minutes all for your path you're

1980
01:39:35,649 --> 01:39:45,659
supposed to go to they could like say

1981
01:39:37,989 --> 01:39:45,659
you're doing it's like a four-hour drive

1982
01:39:45,869 --> 01:39:51,550
you have to fax that to the meed like 24

1983
01:39:50,170 --> 01:39:53,199
hours before you leave and they have to

1984
01:39:51,550 --> 01:39:54,850
approve it and then when you get the

1985
01:39:53,199 --> 01:39:56,920
product there you have to basically do

1986
01:39:54,850 --> 01:39:58,510
the opposite of everything a song by the

1987
01:39:56,920 --> 01:40:00,430
other people yeah

1988
01:39:58,510 --> 01:40:03,730
should've been weighed and then facts

1989
01:40:00,430 --> 01:40:05,110
that it was received yeah so they really

1990
01:40:03,729 --> 01:40:06,399
track all of the product here in

1991
01:40:05,109 --> 01:40:08,859
Colorado they pay a lot of attention

1992
01:40:06,399 --> 01:40:10,750
they called the seed to sale model from

1993
01:40:08,859 --> 01:40:12,429
the minute that we germinate a seed in

1994
01:40:10,750 --> 01:40:15,670
the shop it's under camera and it has a

1995
01:40:12,430 --> 01:40:18,340
MIPS number and an RFID and it'll be

1996
01:40:15,670 --> 01:40:20,170
that RFID until harvest time and when it

1997
01:40:18,340 --> 01:40:21,819
gets tested because everything has to be

1998
01:40:20,170 --> 01:40:24,369
tested when it does get a test it'll be

1999
01:40:21,819 --> 01:40:40,079
tested under that RFID number there was

2000
01:40:24,369 --> 01:40:40,079
just another bunch of recalls today gave

2001
01:40:42,539 --> 01:41:05,800
to too much companies and it was

2002
01:40:47,590 --> 01:41:12,730
literally probably do the customers that

2003
01:41:05,800 --> 01:41:14,890
purchase it back there broadened all the

2004
01:41:12,729 --> 01:41:17,589
products have a batch number so they can

2005
01:41:14,890 --> 01:41:20,980
identify which batch it is so if you

2006
01:41:17,590 --> 01:41:33,279
look on your jar and it has blah blah

2007
01:41:20,979 --> 01:41:34,719
and also two lawsuits years before these

2008
01:41:33,279 --> 01:41:36,039
people find out if they got sick from

2009
01:41:34,720 --> 01:41:37,720
any of the things that they smoked and

2010
01:41:36,039 --> 01:41:39,939
then how can you say that it was this

2011
01:41:37,720 --> 01:41:45,640
batch of hash right here after we've

2012
01:41:39,939 --> 01:41:46,989
done we are that's honestly you're you

2013
01:41:45,640 --> 01:41:49,090

Pixar my first time taking acid I might

2189
01:54:49,668 --> 01:54:54,248
have taken a little bit too much from

2190
01:54:50,899 --> 01:54:54,249
what I remember I was with the dress

2191
01:54:57,488 --> 01:55:01,198
what's the biggest dab you've ever taken

2192
01:54:59,510 --> 01:55:04,739
sloppy

2193
01:55:01,198 --> 01:55:07,738
I'm pretty sure our friend Michael gave

2194
01:55:04,738 --> 01:55:11,069
me like a gram dad once I did a gram at

2195
01:55:07,738 --> 01:55:12,839
the Cannabis Cup and won a t-shirt and I

2196
01:55:11,069 --> 01:55:14,458
almost threw up almost threw up

2197
01:55:12,840 --> 01:55:16,708
I've almost thrown off both times the

2198
01:55:14,458 --> 01:55:18,538
one time that Michael did it was during

2199
01:55:16,708 --> 01:55:20,399
the Super Bowl and I literally took the

2200
01:55:18,538 --> 01:55:26,969
dab stood up in the middle of his house

2201
01:55:20,399 --> 01:55:30,179
took my shirt off and lay down a little

2202
01:55:26,969 --> 01:55:32,489
respirator a big dad like that I think

2203
01:55:30,179 --> 01:55:34,139
if there were to be a dad contest in the

2204
01:55:32,488 --> 01:55:36,689
room I think the last two standards

2205
01:55:34,139 --> 01:55:42,748
would probably be myself and Matty I'll

2206
01:55:36,689 --> 01:55:45,779
be the first person he does not take a

2207
01:55:42,748 --> 01:55:50,429
whole bunch of little dabs his eyes turn

2208
01:55:45,779 --> 01:55:51,719
is red his stop lights he looked into

2209
01:55:50,429 --> 01:55:54,420
the microphone and nodded like the

2210
01:55:51,719 --> 01:55:57,029

01:56:41,488 --> 01:56:53,819
it's uh is you know ie edibles once

2225

whole time like this I like it the first

2278
02:00:03,689 --> 02:00:09,689
time I ever smoked weed was walking home

2279
02:00:06,750 --> 02:00:11,729
from school I was in fifth grade my

2280
02:00:09,689 --> 02:00:13,739
school was a fifth grade through twelfth

2281
02:00:11,729 --> 02:00:15,779
grade in one school cuz the community

2282
02:00:13,739 --> 02:00:17,189
was small and I didn't really know what

2283
02:00:15,779 --> 02:00:18,960
the big kids were doing but they asked

2284
02:00:17,189 --> 02:00:21,210
me if I wanted to smoke and I said yes

2285
02:00:18,960 --> 02:00:22,890
and I went to my friend Dimitri is his

2286
02:00:21,210 --> 02:00:25,230
house and we went to his shed and played

2287
02:00:22,890 --> 02:00:36,240
Sega Genesis and smoke blunts while his

2288
02:00:25,229 --> 02:00:37,769
grandma cooked us chicken to be specific

2289
02:00:36,239 --> 02:00:52,409
and it was the first time I had ever

2290
02:00:37,770 --> 02:00:54,270
seen or smelt them and I was horrible it

2291
02:00:52,409 --> 02:00:56,729
was funny because I was so young that I

2292
02:00:54,270 --> 02:00:58,680
didn't know what I did was wrong until I

2293
02:00:56,729 --> 02:01:01,109
was about to leave when my mom pulled up

2294
02:00:58,680 --> 02:01:02,789
and they're like all right don't eat

2295
02:01:01,109 --> 02:01:04,019
anything when you get home and go in

2296
02:01:02,789 --> 02:01:09,060
your room and tell your mom you have a

2297
02:01:04,020 --> 02:01:11,010
headache but that was every day and

2298
02:01:09,060 --> 02:01:12,429
eventually my mom was like why do you

2299
02:01:11,010 --> 02:01:15,239
have so many

2300
02:01:12,429 --> 02:01:18,670
you're laughing a lot life is too good

2301
02:01:15,238 --> 02:01:19,599
with you enjoying yourself so you didn't

2302
02:01:18,670 --> 02:01:25,149
even know that you were doing something

2303
02:01:19,600 --> 02:01:27,760
bad I mean my mom smoked cigarette I saw

2304
02:01:25,149 --> 02:01:30,009
people sleeping but nah I was just like

2305
02:01:27,760 --> 02:01:31,780
I wanted to be a cool kid it was 5th

2306
02:01:30,010 --> 02:01:34,570
through 12th grade I was there with all

2307
02:01:31,779 --> 02:01:37,509
older kids it was a minority school I

2308
02:01:34,569 --> 02:01:41,679
got integrated into so it was just like

2309
02:01:37,510 --> 02:01:43,539
you know being the hot ball out yeah and

2310
02:01:41,679 --> 02:01:54,279
then I didn't play those video games and

2311
02:01:43,539 --> 02:01:55,448
I was like this is the [ __ ] anybody else

2312
02:01:54,279 --> 02:01:56,679
want to tell about the first time they

2313
02:01:55,448 --> 02:01:58,988
got high you don't have to if you don't

2314
02:01:56,679 --> 02:02:03,969
want to Joe oh wait here do it if you

2315
02:01:58,988 --> 02:02:09,399
want to you let's hear it friends one

2316
02:02:03,969 --> 02:02:11,079
day people came with weed okay this is

2317
02:02:09,399 --> 02:02:21,609
interesting I can see why people enjoy

2318
02:02:11,079 --> 02:02:24,880
this seems about an appropriate age to

2319
02:02:21,609 --> 02:02:41,649
start smoking like the first year was

2320
02:02:24,880 --> 02:02:44,770
really cool after school activity so

2321
02:02:41,649 --> 02:02:52,389
some other things took its place I guess

2322
02:02:44,770 --> 02:02:53,500
so okay with that question miss Maddie

2323
02:02:52,390 --> 02:02:55,300
do you want to tell us about the first

2324
02:02:53,500 --> 02:02:56,800
time that you got to experience and play

2325
02:02:55,300 --> 02:02:59,380
with the wonderful world of ganja and

2326
02:02:56,800 --> 02:03:01,659
cannabis I was really really young I

2327
02:02:59,380 --> 02:03:05,560
can't really say my story on a podcast

2328
02:03:01,658 --> 02:03:07,750
because I'm afraid that might not go so

2329
02:03:05,560 --> 02:03:10,929
well but I was really young I was like

2330
02:03:07,750 --> 02:03:13,680
13 when I like started smoking weed like

2331
02:03:10,929 --> 02:03:17,380
once or twice a week

2332
02:03:13,680 --> 02:03:18,970
yeah 11 just pointed out that sloppy

2333
02:03:17,380 --> 02:03:28,810
said fifth-grade a man he's afraid to

2334
02:03:18,970 --> 02:03:31,630
tell her story but all right I was young

2335
02:03:28,810 --> 02:03:34,630
I was like 13 I probably smoked weed

2336
02:03:31,630 --> 02:03:44,350
before that cigarettes and stuff I grew

2337
02:03:34,630 --> 02:03:46,150
up in like a trailer park so you know so

2338
02:03:44,350 --> 02:03:48,039
when weed was introduced to me it wasn't

2339
02:03:46,149 --> 02:03:53,199
even like a question I thought it was

2340
02:03:48,039 --> 02:03:55,000
just something normal just didn't really

2341
02:03:53,199 --> 02:03:57,250
realize what I was doing was wrong and I

2342
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:58,840
remember one day I sat in a dare class

2343
02:03:57,250 --> 02:04:01,239
because in North Carolina you have to go

2344
02:03:58,840 --> 02:04:03,640
through dare classes which is a drug

2345
02:04:01,239 --> 02:04:06,189
awareness drug abuse resistance

2346
02:04:03,640 --> 02:04:07,869
education there we go and they were

2347
02:04:06,189 --> 02:04:24,609
talking about they were talking about

2348
02:04:07,869 --> 02:04:26,170
marijuana and they're saying how all

2349
02:04:24,609 --> 02:04:28,029
right you know you're up next one's the

2350
02:04:26,170 --> 02:04:29,440
first time do you remember about the

2351
02:04:28,029 --> 02:04:31,809
first time you smoked some weed I think

2352
02:04:29,439 --> 02:04:33,849
I smoked weed I don't like a spray

2353
02:04:31,810 --> 02:04:35,980
bottle I was in like ninth grade

2354
02:04:33,850 --> 02:04:38,860
I don't even didn't even know what

2355
02:04:35,979 --> 02:04:42,159
getting high was so I didn't know what I

2356
02:04:38,859 --> 02:04:45,880
was feeling Jose oh I guess I guess I'm

2357
02:04:42,159 --> 02:04:48,819
high I didn't really touch weed until I

2358
02:04:45,880 --> 02:04:51,390
was like I may be sophomoric up the next

2359
02:04:48,819 --> 02:04:54,649
years when I was like actually smoking

2360
02:04:51,390 --> 02:04:56,570
not like every day but

2361
02:04:54,649 --> 02:04:57,619
two three times a week I guess yeah

2362
02:04:56,569 --> 02:04:59,210
whenever someone's got some weed

2363
02:04:57,619 --> 02:05:01,250
whatever comes up Friday night or

2364
02:04:59,210 --> 02:05:03,270
whatever I think my interest changed

2365
02:05:01,250 --> 02:05:05,369
when

2366
02:05:03,270 --> 02:05:08,280
there I found out about good.we when I

2367
02:05:05,369 --> 02:05:10,319
like first saw like actually like cuz

2368
02:05:08,279 --> 02:05:19,460

Reggie changes your mind a whole never

2370
02:05:19,460 --> 02:05:22,510
[Music]

2371
02:05:28,220 --> 02:05:33,960
so I got some from him and it was like

2372
02:05:31,850 --> 02:05:35,370
super super it was the best weed I'd

2373
02:05:33,960 --> 02:05:39,439
ever seen like me and my friend were

2374
02:05:35,369 --> 02:05:39,439
freaking out like we start smoking it

2375
02:05:45,140 --> 02:05:57,600

nice work let's work alright Mike we're

2378
02:06:00,119 --> 02:06:02,579
gonna shift over to you bro when's the

2379
02:06:01,529 --> 02:06:05,639
first time you ever smoked some weed

2380
02:06:02,579 --> 02:06:09,689
well we thought we were smoking weed

2381
02:06:05,640 --> 02:06:12,119
when we were like 12 it was either the

2382
02:06:09,689 --> 02:06:14,099
worst ditch weed ever or more than

2383
02:06:12,119 --> 02:06:16,439
likely it was just what some older kids

2384
02:06:14,100 --> 02:06:23,070
that sold us as weed and was actually

2385
02:06:16,439 --> 02:06:25,849
mostly tobacco and like some oregano the

2386
02:06:23,069 --> 02:06:28,259
first time I got like really high a

2387
02:06:25,850 --> 02:06:30,660
friend of mine after school when I was

2388
02:06:28,260 --> 02:06:32,789
like 15 it was like hey you wanna go

2389
02:06:30,659 --> 02:06:34,529
smoke and I was like sure and I thought

2390
02:06:32,789 --> 02:06:35,819
they meant cigarettes and we got in her

2391
02:06:34,529 --> 02:06:37,710
car and drove off and I was like this is

2392
02:06:35,819 --> 02:06:38,789
kind of ridiculous I thought - we're

2393
02:06:37,710 --> 02:06:45,180
gonna go around the block what the hell

2394
02:06:38,789 --> 02:06:47,970
is happening we went to her garage and

2395
02:06:45,180 --> 02:06:49,560
got stoned and it was the first time I'd

2396
02:06:47,970 --> 02:06:53,130
ever smoked good week we called it red

2397
02:06:49,560 --> 02:06:55,289
hair which i think is yeah now that I

2398
02:06:53,130 --> 02:06:57,029
know what I know about marijuana like we

2399
02:06:55,289 --> 02:06:58,529
had no [ __ ] clue what we're doing we

2400
02:06:57,029 --> 02:07:02,130
was just happy to have weed that was

2401
02:06:58,529 --> 02:07:04,229
good and I was stoned out of my mind and

2402
02:07:02,130 --> 02:07:06,840
by this point in my life I had sat

2403
02:07:04,229 --> 02:07:10,349
through dozens of hours of anti drug

2404
02:07:06,840 --> 02:07:12,239
education propaganda nonsense and so

2405
02:07:10,350 --> 02:07:14,059
when I finally got dropped off at my

2406
02:07:12,239 --> 02:07:16,578
house I made it inside and fly

2407
02:07:14,059 --> 02:07:19,189
down in the guest bedroom thinking that

2408
02:07:16,578 --> 02:07:21,139
I was gonna die and that my mom was

2409
02:07:19,189 --> 02:07:23,088

time I smoked ganja unfortunately I had

2454
02:09:25,989 --> 02:09:35,649
a couple three uncles who were smoking

2455
02:09:28,779 --> 02:09:38,259

2457
02:09:38,260 --> 02:09:42,310
grew up to become very much like him I

2458
02:09:40,539 --> 02:09:44,500
would hang out with him all the time my

2459
02:09:42,310 --> 02:09:46,330
uncle's Ron Troy and Eric would hang out

2460
02:09:44,500 --> 02:09:47,590
and smoke they had a bong that was the

2461
02:09:46,329 --> 02:09:49,239
color remember those old-school 70s

2462
02:09:47,590 --> 02:09:50,529
bongs it looks like it's pistol grip in

2463
02:09:49,239 --> 02:09:52,420
the front it's got a carb up here by

2464
02:09:50,529 --> 02:09:53,800
your thumb Bowl comes out of the middle

2465
02:09:52,420 --> 02:09:55,329
then it's got like a dick mouthpiece

2466
02:09:53,800 --> 02:09:56,650
that comes off of it it's funky shape

2467
02:09:55,329 --> 02:09:58,840
looks like it was made in ceramics class

2468
02:09:56,649 --> 02:10:01,059
they would sit in a room and just smoke

2469
02:09:58,840 --> 02:10:02,860
out of that [ __ ] bong all the time is

2470
02:10:01,060 --> 02:10:05,530
that like weird shitty ceramic shiny

2471
02:10:02,859 --> 02:10:07,989
glass looking thing and bad to babysit

2472
02:10:05,529 --> 02:10:10,779
me all the time and so hanging out that

2473
02:10:07,989 --> 02:10:11,949
room I got stoned as [ __ ] is a little

2474
02:10:10,779 --> 02:10:15,189
kid but I didn't realize that's what was

2475
02:10:11,949 --> 02:10:18,159
happening I was just like wow something

2476
02:10:15,189 --> 02:10:22,179
was weird and then they took me to a

2477
02:10:18,159 --> 02:10:23,800
concert my uncle's Eric and Ron took me

2478
02:10:22,180 --> 02:10:25,659
to a concert I don't even see it say the

2479
02:10:23,800 --> 02:10:27,670
name of the band cuz it was some cheesy

2480
02:10:25,659 --> 02:10:29,079
hair bands but it's cool I got to go

2481
02:10:27,670 --> 02:10:30,710
with my uncles and it was in Long Beach

2482
02:10:29,079 --> 02:10:33,140
in California so we're

2483
02:10:30,710 --> 02:10:34,430
El Camino it's like a small truck and

2484
02:10:33,140 --> 02:10:36,560
they were in the front I was in the back

2485
02:10:34,430 --> 02:10:39,289
and they decided to smoke a joint on the

2486
02:10:36,560 --> 02:10:41,570
way and play The Black Album from

2487
02:10:39,289 --> 02:10:43,460
Metallica and that was a life-changing

2488
02:10:41,569 --> 02:10:45,380
Drive that's what made me a drummer

2489
02:10:43,460 --> 02:10:47,779
that's part of what made me a pothead I

2490
02:10:45,380 --> 02:10:49,520
got so stoned from the joint they smoked

2491
02:10:47,779 --> 02:11:00,469
all the smoke blew right in the back of

2492
02:10:49,520 --> 02:11:01,790
the [ __ ] vehicle hit the joint and

2493
02:11:00,470 --> 02:11:04,010
they played that black album from

2494
02:11:01,789 --> 02:11:05,029
Metallica and by the time we got back I

2495
02:11:04,010 --> 02:11:06,680
was already figuring out how I was gonna

2496
02:11:05,029 --> 02:11:15,559
go buy that album the next day I was

2497
02:11:06,680 --> 02:11:16,970
like yeah yeah [ __ ] and then shortly

2498
02:11:15,560 --> 02:11:20,210
after that my friend Chris Ruth smoked

2499
02:11:16,970 --> 02:11:22,250
me out and got me stupid I and we're in

2500
02:11:20,210 --> 02:11:23,810
the parking lot of my elementary school

2501
02:11:22,250 --> 02:11:25,220
I wasn't in elementary school anymore at

2502
02:11:23,810 --> 02:11:28,520
this time I was an adult by now

2503
02:11:25,220 --> 02:11:31,699
I smoked a joint or a bowl with my buddy

2504
02:11:28,520 --> 02:11:33,950
Chris Ruth probably probably whole was I

2505
02:11:31,699 --> 02:11:36,849
say seventh grade I left California

2506
02:11:33,949 --> 02:11:38,960
before ninth grade before tenth grade oh

2507
02:11:36,850 --> 02:11:40,789
great when I first smoked weed was Chris

2508
02:11:38,960 --> 02:11:42,590
Ruth but I didn't smoke for a long time

2509
02:11:40,789 --> 02:11:45,439
I didn't she would get me so high that I

2510
02:11:42,590 --> 02:11:46,880
didn't like it it was too much like he

2511
02:11:45,439 --> 02:11:48,139
was trying to he sought it was funny but

2512
02:11:46,880 --> 02:11:50,869
he would get me so [ __ ] high that I

2513
02:11:48,140 --> 02:11:52,460
didn't even enjoy it so I came out here

2514
02:11:50,869 --> 02:11:54,319
and then I met up with some friends and

2515
02:11:52,460 --> 02:11:58,250
they were smoking a bowl and I was like

2516
02:11:54,319 --> 02:11:59,689
oh I didn't get stupid high smoking bids

2517
02:11:58,250 --> 02:12:01,279
in Cali they're smoking good weed now

2518
02:11:59,689 --> 02:12:02,989
here they're smoking shitty weed so I

2519
02:12:01,279 --> 02:12:04,219
could smoke that so I got some training

2520
02:12:02,989 --> 02:12:09,409
wheels and I learned how to really smoke

2521
02:12:04,220 --> 02:12:11,060

02:14:29,760 --> 02:14:35,918
I really like when Jesse's here because

2568
02:14:33,189 --> 02:14:37,749
Jesse gets so high when he's hanging out

2569
02:14:35,918 --> 02:14:41,319
with all of us cuz he just keeps taking

2570
02:14:37,748 --> 02:14:50,948
tabs with us I think it's hilarious to

2571
02:14:41,319 --> 02:14:52,418
see I didn't eat anything today buzz you

2572

2573
02:14:52,418 --> 02:14:57,010
moment from the time you were on that

2574
02:14:55,238 --> 02:14:59,768
everybody really heard podcast number

2575
02:14:57,010 --> 02:15:05,409
two I would have never told anybody

2576
02:14:59,769 --> 02:15:07,208
about that totally messed up the first

2577
02:15:05,408 --> 02:15:08,408
episode some people get stage fright a

2578
02:15:07,208 --> 02:15:09,788
little bit when we hit record

2579
02:15:08,408 --> 02:15:11,679
some people go blank as soon as you hit

2580
02:15:09,788 --> 02:15:14,498
the record button talkative people go

2581
02:15:11,679 --> 02:15:15,849
silent so we had buzzy on one night and

2582
02:15:14,498 --> 02:15:17,349
he was talking and he just went blank

2583
02:15:15,849 --> 02:15:19,328
from a DAB so we had to piece together

2584
02:15:17,349 --> 02:15:21,340
two episodes and we made a great episode

2585
02:15:19,328 --> 02:15:27,058
so it wasn't bad at all but I'm glad you

2586
02:15:21,340 --> 02:15:31,418
enjoyed take two and dabbed in a while

2587
02:15:27,059 --> 02:15:33,340
then I took one and I was just gone yeah

2588
02:15:31,418 --> 02:15:42,609
and it was arrived to the streets of TV

2589
02:15:33,340 --> 02:15:46,090

2590
02:15:42,609 --> 02:15:48,038
color sloppy sloppy it's your second

2591

never say black unless it's black and

2663
02:20:04,860 --> 02:20:17,880
that's not a that's a good thing we can

2664
02:20:16,770 --> 02:20:26,040
talk about her for the last couple of

2665
02:20:17,879 --> 02:20:35,369
minutes on the show we'll be takin you

2666
02:20:26,040 --> 02:20:37,020
trippin I just what's the way to do that

2667
02:20:35,370 --> 02:20:41,130
what's the best way to handle that you

2668
02:20:37,020 --> 02:21:01,140
guys what is the most you literally have

2669
02:20:41,129 --> 02:21:03,389
to just educate them for I think it's

2670
02:21:01,139 --> 02:21:05,489
rude to see somebody smoking something

2671
02:21:03,389 --> 02:21:08,939
bad for them and not inform them like

2672
02:21:05,489 --> 02:21:11,069
they may get like you know even if they

2673
02:21:08,939 --> 02:21:12,689
get defensive about it like don't try to

2674
02:21:11,069 --> 02:21:14,189
be confrontational with it but at least

2675
02:21:12,689 --> 02:21:16,319
you can feel good at the end of the day

2676
02:21:14,189 --> 02:21:17,639
like hey I told that Duty smoking

2677
02:21:16,319 --> 02:21:20,579
something that's gonna kill them yeah

2678
02:21:17,639 --> 02:21:23,219
because like if I saw somebody drop some

2679
02:21:20,579 --> 02:21:24,780
rat poison in some lasagna and then put

2680
02:21:23,219 --> 02:21:32,188
it at the table I definitely look at

2681
02:21:24,780 --> 02:21:34,200
y'all be like hey so I just think it's

2682
02:21:32,189 --> 02:21:37,950
wrong not to be like I would just like

2683
02:21:34,200 --> 02:21:39,479
anybody kay I'm I don't want to like you

2684
02:21:37,950 --> 02:21:41,250
know offend you in any way but I don't

2685
02:21:39,478 --> 02:21:45,539
feel comfortable smoking that and this

2686
02:21:41,250 --> 02:21:52,129
is why kind of looks like booboo my

2687
02:21:45,540 --> 02:21:52,130
friend's dad's up

2688
02:21:58,931 --> 02:22:15,431
and that's what my solution this and

2689
02:22:04,750 --> 02:22:16,440
just give back to them and get some good

2690
02:22:15,431 --> 02:22:18,790
hash

2691
02:22:16,440 --> 02:22:20,170
don't settle for some crap I know some

2692
02:22:18,790 --> 02:22:22,120
years just want to get high copper buzz

2693
02:22:20,170 --> 02:22:25,569
don't settle for some boo boo spoke some

2694
02:22:22,120 --> 02:22:27,101
good hash it's a weed next rags that's

2695
02:22:25,569 --> 02:22:49,000
the truth it should never crackle

2696
02:22:27,101 --> 02:22:50,860
sometimes in the summer it'll crackle I

2697
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:57,909

I'm slightly dabbed out it's been a

2825
02:36:43,750 --> 02:36:48,280
beautiful day last night was an amazing

2826
02:36:46,090 --> 02:36:51,310
night I got to see the legendary reggae

2827
02:36:48,280 --> 02:36:53,620
band Israel vibration in Denver at the

2828
02:36:51,310 --> 02:36:55,720
Ogden Theatre I've talked about it

2829
02:36:53,620 --> 02:36:57,221
before the roots radix was there the

2830
02:36:55,720 --> 02:36:59,500
roots radix is of course the backing

2831
02:36:57,220 --> 02:37:01,899
band for his real vibe raishin they were

2832
02:36:59,500 --> 02:37:04,060
solid Israel vibration was solid and on

2833
02:37:01,899 --> 02:37:05,859
fire unfortunately I feel like it's

2834
02:37:04,060 --> 02:37:07,511
probably getting close to the end for

2835
02:37:05,860 --> 02:37:10,360
that band this might be one of their

2836
02:37:07,511 --> 02:37:12,069
final tours um just a little rant about

2837
02:37:10,360 --> 02:37:13,960
Israel vibration Israel vibration is a

2838
02:37:12,069 --> 02:37:17,470
Jamaican reggae band that actually met

2839
02:37:13,959 --> 02:37:19,029
in an orphanage for children with polio

2840
02:37:17,470 --> 02:37:20,529
so there were three members of Israel

2841
02:37:19,030 --> 02:37:22,300
vibration all three of them had polio

2842
02:37:20,530 --> 02:37:24,511
several years ago one member left the

2843
02:37:22,299 --> 02:37:27,760
band and now they're only two dudes left

2844
02:37:24,511 --> 02:37:29,440
um it is my opinion that one dude looks

2845
02:37:27,761 --> 02:37:30,819
like he is done touring the look on his

2846
02:37:29,440 --> 02:37:33,250
face during the show just looks like

2847
02:37:30,819 --> 02:37:34,629
he's struggling ah the polio was getting

2848
02:37:33,250 --> 02:37:35,890
to him it's kicking his ass the other

2849
02:37:34,629 --> 02:37:38,079
guy looks like he's doing pretty good he

2850
02:37:35,890 --> 02:37:40,090
gets around quite well the one guy looks

2851
02:37:38,079 --> 02:37:41,110
like he made he I don't think he wants

2852
02:37:40,090 --> 02:37:42,640
to tour anymore it looks like the other

2853
02:37:41,110 --> 02:37:43,989
dudes dragging him out on tour he's like

2854
02:37:42,640 --> 02:37:45,670
you can't be Israel vibration without

2855
02:37:43,989 --> 02:37:47,170
both of us so I need you to come with

2856
02:37:45,670 --> 02:37:49,210
them that's kind of what it looks like

2857
02:37:47,170 --> 02:37:50,530
to me so I may actually catch his real

2858
02:37:49,209 --> 02:37:52,180
vibration again tonight just kind of

2859
02:37:50,530 --> 02:37:53,290
depends on how things go after recording

2860
02:37:52,181 --> 02:37:54,909

2861

seven ten or mahatma showing either one

3045
02:43:57,978 --> 02:44:00,978
of those not either one of those numbers

3046
02:43:59,420 --> 02:44:02,600
on their labels you guys take those

3047
02:44:00,978 --> 02:44:04,879
products back to where you purchased

3048
02:44:02,600 --> 02:44:06,620
them and either ask for an exchange for

3049
02:44:04,879 --> 02:44:08,750
something without pesticides in it or

3050
02:44:06,620 --> 02:44:10,699
get your damn money back i do not know

3051
02:44:08,750 --> 02:44:12,439
the return policy on any dispensary they

3052
02:44:10,699 --> 02:44:13,670
may not give you back your money they

3053
02:44:12,439 --> 02:44:15,889
may give you a store credit for a

3054
02:44:13,670 --> 02:44:17,359
product but whatever you do don't change

3055
02:44:15,889 --> 02:44:18,099
it you do not want to smoke this

3056
02:44:17,359 --> 02:44:20,449
pesticide

3057
02:44:18,100 --> 02:44:22,100
alright consumers are urged to destroy

3058
02:44:20,449 --> 02:44:24,229
the product or return it to the place of

3059
02:44:22,100 --> 02:44:25,729
purchase is what the article says it is

3060
02:44:24,228 --> 02:44:27,590
the second business this month to issue

3061
02:44:25,728 --> 02:44:28,849
a recall of its marijuana over concerns

3062
02:44:27,590 --> 02:44:30,648
that potentially dangerous pesticides

3063
02:44:28,850 --> 02:44:33,020
that were used to cultivate the plants

3064
02:44:30,648 --> 02:44:35,269
the other true cannabis issued a recall

3065
02:44:33,020 --> 02:44:37,158
on october 13th after test determined

3066
02:44:35,270 --> 02:44:39,079
three disallowed pesticides were used to

3067
02:44:37,158 --> 02:44:42,170
grow plants that were later processed

3068
02:44:39,079 --> 02:44:44,870
into marijuana infused products or m IPS

3069
02:44:42,170 --> 02:44:45,630
as with colfax pot shop plants grown by

3070
02:44:44,870 --> 02:44:47,190
true cannabis

3071
02:44:45,630 --> 02:44:48,689
and sent to Mahatma for processing were

3072
02:44:47,190 --> 02:44:50,399
found to contain the pesticides health

3073
02:44:48,690 --> 02:44:52,201
officials said there have been no

3074
02:44:50,399 --> 02:44:54,661
reports of illness associated with any

3075
02:44:52,200 --> 02:44:56,910
of these recalls you guys in my opinion

3076
02:44:54,661 --> 02:44:59,460
it's gonna take a long time for health

3077
02:44:56,911 --> 02:45:01,771
effects to be noticeable from smoking a

3078
02:44:59,460 --> 02:45:03,720
pesticide like this I'm not a doctor I'm

3079
02:45:01,771 --> 02:45:05,431
not a scientist but these are the kinds

3080
02:45:03,720 --> 02:45:07,740
of things that you smoke them today and

3081
02:45:05,431 --> 02:45:09,149
you don't notice it until you're 20

3082
02:45:07,740 --> 02:45:10,921
years down the road and you've got some

3083
02:45:09,149 --> 02:45:12,960
[ __ ] up tumor in your lung you've got

3084
02:45:10,921 --> 02:45:14,220
some weird cancer you've got something

3085
02:45:12,960 --> 02:45:16,501
in your mouth that grew from this

3086
02:45:14,220 --> 02:45:18,720
pesticide that you smoked some of these

3087
02:45:16,501 --> 02:45:20,490
things will not affect you some of these

3088
02:45:18,720 --> 02:45:22,649
things will go into your body and affect

3089
02:45:20,490 --> 02:45:24,751
your body in really crazy ways and they

3090
02:45:22,649 --> 02:45:27,421
will affect future generations of your

3091
02:45:24,751 --> 02:45:30,031
family so be aware of what you're

3092
02:45:27,421 --> 02:45:31,681
consuming you guys and I don't think

3093
02:45:30,031 --> 02:45:33,601
that people are going to start reporting

3094
02:45:31,681 --> 02:45:35,131
these illnesses for a very long time

3095
02:45:33,601 --> 02:45:36,511
maybe somebody did smoke something with

3096
02:45:35,130 --> 02:45:38,070
a little too much pesticide on it they

3097
02:45:36,511 --> 02:45:39,781
got sick right away but that's very

3098
02:45:38,070 --> 02:45:41,640
uncommon these plants have been through

3099
02:45:39,781 --> 02:45:44,821
the drying and curing phase they've been

3100
02:45:41,640 --> 02:45:46,320
trimmed you can't see smell or feel this

3101
02:45:44,820 --> 02:45:48,001
[ __ ] on there it's got to be lab tested

3102
02:45:46,320 --> 02:45:49,950
to find it I'll continue with the

3103
02:45:48,001 --> 02:45:51,751
article MIPS often contain much higher

3104
02:45:49,950 --> 02:45:53,460
concentration to pesticides than dried

3105
02:45:51,751 --> 02:45:55,560
plants process for smoking because of

3106
02:45:53,460 --> 02:45:57,390
the method used to extract THC and other

3107
02:45:55,560 --> 02:45:59,610
cannabinoids from the plant also

3108
02:45:57,390 --> 02:46:01,591
pesticide levels dissipate quickly and

3109
02:45:59,611 --> 02:46:04,230
dried marijuana while amounts found in

3110
02:46:01,591 --> 02:46:06,541
MIPS typically do not because that is

3111
02:46:04,229 --> 02:46:09,001
extremely accurate when you make hash if

3112
02:46:06,540 --> 02:46:11,100
you take a bud a plant that has been

3113
02:46:09,001 --> 02:46:13,591
sprayed with pesticides and you make ash

3114
02:46:11,101 --> 02:46:15,841
with it sometimes we can see the

3115
02:46:13,591 --> 02:46:17,820
pesticide floating on the top of the

3116
02:46:15,841 --> 02:46:19,229
hash we can see a little sheen sometimes

3117
02:46:17,820 --> 02:46:21,001
we can see this little greasy layer

3118
02:46:19,229 --> 02:46:22,800
sometimes we'll make a batch of hash and

3119
02:46:21,001 --> 02:46:24,511
let it finish and then you can touch the

3120
02:46:22,800 --> 02:46:27,180
top of it and you can feel on your

3121
02:46:24,511 --> 02:46:30,661
fingers a little oily layer of neem oil

3122
02:46:27,181 --> 02:46:32,131
or styling oil whatever type of oily

3123
02:46:30,661 --> 02:46:34,411
product was applied to the plants

3124
02:46:32,130 --> 02:46:36,300
botanical oils sometimes you can see

3125
02:46:34,411 --> 02:46:37,831
that floating on top of the hatch and we

3126
02:46:36,300 --> 02:46:39,210
don't there's it's hard to get out of

3127
02:46:37,831 --> 02:46:40,440
there you guys it's gonna make your hash

3128
02:46:39,210 --> 02:46:42,990
taste like that you're gonna be

3129
02:46:40,440 --> 02:46:44,611
consuming it stop spraying your plants

3130
02:46:42,990 --> 02:46:46,171
with [ __ ] that's I think the point

3131
02:46:44,611 --> 02:46:47,400
here anyway I will continue with the

3132
02:46:46,171 --> 02:46:49,899
article because I feel like I've gotten

3133
02:46:47,399 --> 02:46:51,850
myself off-track

3134
02:46:49,899 --> 02:46:53,529
the recalls 1/4 announced by the Denver

3135
02:46:51,851 --> 02:46:55,180
Department of Environmental Health since

3136
02:46:53,530 --> 02:46:58,150
it began cracking down on pesticides

3137
02:46:55,180 --> 02:46:59,829
last spring quarantine a 100,000 plants

3138
02:46:58,149 --> 02:47:01,569
the worries about pesticides and

3139
02:46:59,829 --> 02:47:03,370
marijuana are the result of federal laws

3140
02:47:01,569 --> 02:47:05,409
that deemed the drug illegal and as a

3141
02:47:03,370 --> 02:47:07,180
result safety tests have not been done

3142
02:47:05,409 --> 02:47:09,039
on the chemicals when CIFAS went

3143
02:47:07,180 --> 02:47:11,680
specifically ingested on marijuana

3144
02:47:09,040 --> 02:47:13,690
marijuana can be classed as either food

3145
02:47:11,680 --> 02:47:16,210
or a drug because of various ways it can

3146
02:47:13,690 --> 02:47:18,220
be consumed federal law deems it a drug

3147
02:47:16,209 --> 02:47:19,659
state agriculture officials have

3148
02:47:18,219 --> 02:47:21,670
proposed a rule that would limit the

3149
02:47:19,659 --> 02:47:24,010
number of pesticides allowed for use in

3150
02:47:21,670 --> 02:47:25,840
growing marijuana to about 75 of the

3151
02:47:24,010 --> 02:47:27,880
least harmful the rule would allow

3152
02:47:25,840 --> 02:47:29,380
manufacturers of pesticides among the

3153
02:47:27,879 --> 02:47:31,689
improved products to petition the

3154
02:47:29,379 --> 02:47:33,759
government to let marijuana growers use

3155
02:47:31,690 --> 02:47:35,950
its chemical the company would have to

3156
02:47:33,760 --> 02:47:37,360
first approve the pesticide is safe to

3157
02:47:35,950 --> 02:47:39,521
humans and the environment

3158
02:47:37,360 --> 02:47:41,380
currently growers can use more than 200

3159
02:47:39,521 --> 02:47:43,030
pesticides the state says has warning

3160
02:47:41,379 --> 02:47:44,739
labels so broad they're using the

3161
02:47:43,030 --> 02:47:47,200
product on cannabis would not violate

3162
02:47:44,739 --> 02:47:49,780
federal laws that require chemicals to

3163
02:47:47,200 --> 02:47:51,370
be used only as directed you guys when

3164
02:47:49,780 --> 02:47:52,510
you open up any pesticide there's that

3165
02:47:51,370 --> 02:47:53,771
little or when you buy the bottle

3166
02:47:52,510 --> 02:47:55,899
there's that little booklet attached to

3167
02:47:53,771 --> 02:47:57,370
the back all you have to do is pop that

3168
02:47:55,899 --> 02:47:59,799
open and unfold and there are a bunch of

3169
02:47:57,370 --> 02:48:01,660
rules and regulations in there it tells

3170
02:47:59,799 --> 02:48:03,159
you how you can apply that pesticide it

3171
02:48:01,659 --> 02:48:05,319
says what it can be used for it says

3172
02:48:03,159 --> 02:48:08,829
what type of crops it can be used on it

3173
02:48:05,319 --> 02:48:10,389
has got a window of re-entry listed on

3174
02:48:08,829 --> 02:48:12,610
there it will say if you spray this

3175
02:48:10,389 --> 02:48:14,619
product do not re-enter this room for up

3176
02:48:12,610 --> 02:48:16,060
to four hours or if you do enter the

3177
02:48:14,620 --> 02:48:17,910
room be in proper equipment use a

3178
02:48:16,060 --> 02:48:20,020
ventilator use some type of covering

3179
02:48:17,909 --> 02:48:22,629
there will be a lot of things written on

3180
02:48:20,021 --> 02:48:25,450
there if you do not use that pesticide

3181
02:48:22,629 --> 02:48:27,189
the way that that direction label says

3182
02:48:25,450 --> 02:48:30,070
to use it you are in violation of

3183
02:48:27,190 --> 02:48:31,930
federal law if a farmer in an

3184
02:48:30,069 --> 02:48:33,940
agriculture rural business is caught

3185
02:48:31,930 --> 02:48:36,101
using those pesticides improperly he

3186
02:48:33,940 --> 02:48:39,399
will be fine he will face a federal law

3187
02:48:36,101 --> 02:48:41,140
his farm will face penalties this is

3188
02:48:39,399 --> 02:48:42,760
serious stuff I did not realize how

3189
02:48:41,139 --> 02:48:44,229
important this was and how serious this

3190
02:48:42,760 --> 02:48:46,389
was until I had a little bit of training

3191
02:48:44,229 --> 02:48:48,310
from the Colorado Colorado Department of

3192
02:48:46,389 --> 02:48:50,409
Agriculture so you guys pay attention to

3193
02:48:48,310 --> 02:48:52,389
those warnings in a serious [ __ ] you may

3194
02:48:50,409 --> 02:48:53,649
not notice how much risk you are putting

3195
02:48:52,389 --> 02:48:55,569
yourself in when you're using these

3196
02:48:53,649 --> 02:48:57,399
pesticides I recommend that you go and

3197
02:48:55,569 --> 02:48:58,930
read about each pesticide that you're

3198
02:48:57,399 --> 02:49:00,879
using read about each ingredient in

3199
02:48:58,930 --> 02:49:02,260
there find out what it's derived from if

3200
02:49:00,879 --> 02:49:03,250
I know what it's going to do to you in

3201
02:49:02,260 --> 02:49:04,840
small concentration

3202
02:49:03,250 --> 02:49:06,610
and find out what it's going to do to

3203
02:49:04,840 --> 02:49:09,010
you in large concentrations find out

3204
02:49:06,610 --> 02:49:10,360
what you're exposing yourself to read

3205
02:49:09,010 --> 02:49:13,059
about what you're putting on your

3206
02:49:10,360 --> 02:49:14,409
medicine you're spraying people's it may

3207
02:49:13,059 --> 02:49:16,389
be recreational marijuana

3208
02:49:14,409 --> 02:49:17,889
it may be medical marijuana either way

3209
02:49:16,389 --> 02:49:19,149
find out what you're spraying on the

3210
02:49:17,889 --> 02:49:20,949
stuff that you're giving to the people

3211
02:49:19,149 --> 02:49:22,359
that you care about if you're taking

3212
02:49:20,950 --> 02:49:24,310
money for a product if you're giving

3213
02:49:22,360 --> 02:49:25,870
this product is a medical treatment you

3214
02:49:24,309 --> 02:49:27,309
need to take pride in it it is your

3215
02:49:25,870 --> 02:49:29,260
responsibility to make sure that no

3216
02:49:27,309 --> 02:49:31,090
[ __ ] goes into your customers or

3217
02:49:29,260 --> 02:49:33,010
your patients your clients whatever you

3218
02:49:31,090 --> 02:49:34,750
want to call them their lungs and bodies

3219
02:49:33,010 --> 02:49:36,550
should be treated like a temple and it's

3220
02:49:34,750 --> 02:49:38,799
your responsibility that their cannabis

3221
02:49:36,549 --> 02:49:40,719
is clean and safe so that's your job as

3222
02:49:38,799 --> 02:49:42,429
a grower so read about all the

3223
02:49:40,719 --> 02:49:44,260
pesticides I'm gonna continue and read

3224
02:49:42,430 --> 02:49:46,210
the last line of the article it says

3225
02:49:44,260 --> 02:49:47,950
despite the allowance state officials

3226
02:49:46,209 --> 02:49:49,689
have said they do not endorse the use of

3227
02:49:47,950 --> 02:49:54,250
pesticides on marijuana because there is

3228
02:49:49,690 --> 02:49:55,810
no data to ensure consumers are safe it

3229
02:49:54,250 --> 02:49:57,610
would be nice if we did not have to use

3230
02:49:55,809 --> 02:50:00,059
any pesticides at all on growing

3231
02:49:57,610 --> 02:50:02,350
cannabis but it is very unrealistic

3232
02:50:00,059 --> 02:50:04,539
there are pests everywhere we are

3233
02:50:02,350 --> 02:50:06,460
building a new facility our grow

3234
02:50:04,540 --> 02:50:08,290
facility is it's basically the desert

3235
02:50:06,459 --> 02:50:12,309
it's a rocky desert it is in Pueblo West

3236
02:50:08,290 --> 02:50:14,530
Colorado outside of the facility there

3237
02:50:12,309 --> 02:50:17,049
are lizards there are snakes there are

3238
02:50:14,530 --> 02:50:19,930
tarantulas there are spiders there are

3239
02:50:17,049 --> 02:50:21,489
centipedes and we have built this

3240
02:50:19,930 --> 02:50:23,649
facility from the ground up it's a

3241
02:50:21,489 --> 02:50:26,170
sealed facility and still occasionally I

3242
02:50:23,649 --> 02:50:28,239
will have to escort a baby tarantula out

3243
02:50:26,170 --> 02:50:30,489
of the building or chase down a lizard

3244
02:50:28,239 --> 02:50:32,920
out of the building it's hard to keep

3245
02:50:30,489 --> 02:50:35,469
[ __ ] out of buildings insects are much

3246
02:50:32,920 --> 02:50:37,870
smaller than these tarantula the pot

3247
02:50:35,469 --> 02:50:39,459
pests are much smaller than tarantulas

3248
02:50:37,870 --> 02:50:41,290
and lizards so keeping them out of there

3249
02:50:39,459 --> 02:50:42,489
well sometimes require some sort of a

3250
02:50:41,290 --> 02:50:44,170
pesticide of course we're gonna finish

3251
02:50:42,489 --> 02:50:45,280
the building and make well seal it up a

3252
02:50:44,170 --> 02:50:47,170
little bit better but I mean it's hard

3253
02:50:45,280 --> 02:50:48,970
to keep [ __ ] out as my point so we need

3254
02:50:47,170 --> 02:50:50,799
some type of pesticide we need some type

3255
02:50:48,969 --> 02:50:52,869
of prevention we need some type of

3256
02:50:50,799 --> 02:50:54,670
integrated pest management system that

3257
02:50:52,870 --> 02:50:56,560
will keep the bugs away and a lot of

3258
02:50:54,670 --> 02:50:58,450
times that requires some sort of a

3259
02:50:56,559 --> 02:51:00,129
bottled pesticide if you're gonna use it

3260
02:50:58,450 --> 02:51:01,630
you guys be responsible go to the

3261
02:51:00,129 --> 02:51:03,189
Department of Agriculture read about

3262
02:51:01,629 --> 02:51:05,319
what you're using and learn what you are

3263
02:51:03,190 --> 02:51:06,940
applying to your plants because I'm

3264
02:51:05,319 --> 02:51:09,159

3265
02:51:06,940 --> 02:51:11,710

some snap and peel can I almost shatter

3274
02:51:25,360 --> 02:51:28,630
it snaps a little more than it shatters

3275
02:51:27,040 --> 02:51:29,710
little flexible it's a little warm in

3276

3300
02:52:16,299 --> 02:52:20,679
this article comes from our good friends

3301
02:52:18,219 --> 02:52:23,139
in Canada shout out to Canada Canada has

3302
02:52:20,680 --> 02:52:24,729
elected a new prime minister who seems

3303
02:52:23,139 --> 02:52:26,799
to be on our side because this article

3304
02:52:24,728 --> 02:52:28,899
comes from vice news it was written by

3305
02:52:26,799 --> 02:52:30,609
Rachel Brown the headline says Trudeau

3306
02:52:28,899 --> 02:52:33,069
held the best thing that's ever happened

3307
02:52:30,610 --> 02:52:36,250
to Canadian weed and the article goes

3308
02:52:33,069 --> 02:52:37,809
like this Justin Trudeau hasn't even

3309
02:52:36,250 --> 02:52:39,610
been officially sworn in as Prime

3310
02:52:37,809 --> 02:52:41,769
Minister yet but as far as marijuana

3311
02:52:39,610 --> 02:52:45,310
advocates are concerned his promise to

3312
02:52:41,770 --> 02:52:47,050
fully legalize it as sorry his promise

3313
02:52:45,309 --> 02:52:49,569
to fully legalize it is as good as

3314
02:52:47,049 --> 02:52:51,549
fulfilled Potts legal wrote Marc Emery

3315
02:52:49,569 --> 02:52:53,319
Canada's so-called prince of PAS the day

3316
02:52:51,549 --> 02:52:55,899
after Trudeau and his Liberal Party won

3317
02:52:53,319 --> 02:52:57,309
the federal election by a landslide one

3318
02:52:55,899 --> 02:52:59,260
of mr. Trudeau's official declaration

3319
02:52:57,309 --> 02:53:02,439
should be the war against cannabis

3320
02:52:59,260 --> 02:53:04,000
culture in Canada is over by securing a

3321
02:53:02,439 --> 02:53:05,680
majority government the Liberals are

3322
02:53:04,000 --> 02:53:08,559
poised to move quickly on their pledge

3323
02:53:05,680 --> 02:53:10,569
to legalize regulate and restrict and

3324
02:53:08,559 --> 02:53:12,909
restrict access to marijuana for

3325
02:53:10,569 --> 02:53:15,610
recreational use which Trudeau has built

3326
02:53:12,909 --> 02:53:18,129
as a top priority though the incoming

3327
02:53:15,610 --> 02:53:20,470
Prime Minister has yet to specify what

3328
02:53:18,129 --> 02:53:22,179
exactly what legalizations would look

3329
02:53:20,469 --> 02:53:23,739
like and it could take years for it to

3330
02:53:22,180 --> 02:53:25,720
come to fruition things are already

3331
02:53:23,739 --> 02:53:27,039

3349
02:54:17,420 --> 02:54:22,100
pretty sure I was reading an article now

3350
02:54:18,889 --> 02:54:23,659
let's find where I was where was I the

3351
02:54:22,100 --> 02:54:25,430
morning after the election stocks soared

3352
02:54:23,659 --> 02:54:27,350
four three of the country's top medical

3353
02:54:25,430 --> 02:54:29,450
marijuana producers some cannabis

3354
02:54:27,350 --> 02:54:31,430
companies canopy Canada began trading

3355
02:54:29,450 --> 02:54:33,110
publicly last year after Health Canada

3356
02:54:31,430 --> 02:54:35,030
started issuing licenses to companies

3357
02:54:33,110 --> 02:54:38,000
for the country's estimated 40,000

3358
02:54:35,030 --> 02:54:39,680
registered medical cannabis users one

3359
02:54:38,000 --> 02:54:42,260
study suggests there are two point three

3360
02:54:39,680 --> 02:54:43,850
million marijuana users in Canada that's

3361
02:54:42,260 --> 02:54:45,920
an oddly worded statement there at the

3362
02:54:43,850 --> 02:54:47,360
end of that paragraph the current

3363
02:54:45,920 --> 02:54:50,540
medical marijuana industry is believed

3364
02:54:47,360 --> 02:54:52,370
to be worth between 80 and 100 million

3365
02:54:50,540 --> 02:54:54,350
dollars it's believed to be one of the

3366
02:54:52,370 --> 02:54:56,600
best regulatory systems in the world and

3367
02:54:54,350 --> 02:54:58,280
is highly regulated Aaron Saul's

3368
02:54:56,600 --> 02:55:01,220
an analyst with Dundee Capital Markets

3369
02:54:58,280 --> 02:55:03,320
told the Financial Post that it could

3370
02:55:01,219 --> 02:55:06,109
balloon to five billion dollars if the

3371
02:55:03,319 --> 02:55:07,340
market is fully legalized it feels like

3372
02:55:06,110 --> 02:55:09,200
they're missing a couple short words

3373
02:55:07,340 --> 02:55:11,090
here like those and ands and some spots

3374
02:55:09,200 --> 02:55:12,380
it's weird anyway the Canadian marijuana

3375
02:55:11,090 --> 02:55:15,409
space could be sent for another

3376
02:55:12,379 --> 02:55:17,569
revolution Saul said Bruce Linton CEO of

3377
02:55:15,409 --> 02:55:20,030
tweed the largest of Canada's 26

3378
02:55:17,569 --> 02:55:21,860
licensed cannabis producers told vice

3379
02:55:20,030 --> 02:55:23,479
news in a previous interview that the

3380
02:55:21,860 --> 02:55:26,120
medical marijuana industry can only

3381
02:55:23,478 --> 02:55:27,590
benefit under a new legal regime as it

3382
02:55:26,120 --> 02:55:30,410
will likely facilitate the production

3383
02:55:27,590 --> 02:55:33,079
for recreational marijuana similarly to

3384
02:55:30,409 --> 02:55:35,000
the way things unfolded in Colorado I

3385
02:55:33,079 --> 02:55:36,920
would think that for licensed producers

3386
02:55:35,000 --> 02:55:38,389
which are large regulated and under

3387
02:55:36,920 --> 02:55:39,850
controlled shipping and accounting

3388
02:55:38,389 --> 02:55:41,978
procedures

3389
02:55:39,850 --> 02:55:43,059
what which are large regulated and under

3390
02:55:41,978 --> 02:55:44,469
controlled shipping and accounting

3391
02:55:43,059 --> 02:55:45,939
procedures would be the first choice for

3392
02:55:44,469 --> 02:55:47,769
delivery because that's the first

3393
02:55:45,939 --> 02:55:49,898
methodology to gain control of the

3394
02:55:47,770 --> 02:55:51,640
supply chain said Leighton those running

3395
02:55:49,898 --> 02:55:53,858
Vancouver's marijuana dispensaries which

3396
02:55:51,639 --> 02:55:55,629
operate in a legal gray zone because

3397
02:55:53,859 --> 02:55:57,399
they sell marijuana without licenses

3398
02:55:55,629 --> 02:55:59,829
from Health Canada are looking forward

3399
02:55:57,398 --> 02:56:01,299
to a fully legalized industry earlier

3400
02:55:59,829 --> 02:56:04,000
this year Health Canada threatened to

3401
02:56:01,299 --> 02:56:06,519
send some RC its Royal Canadian Mounted

3402
02:56:04,000 --> 02:56:07,568
Police Officers to shut them down we're

3403
02:56:06,520 --> 02:56:10,090
dancing in the streets

3404
02:56:07,568 --> 02:56:12,908

happened to the cannabis industry Cheryl

like open season in Canada and the

3420

opportunities to invest there keep

3421
02:56:41,590 --> 02:56:45,100
growing and growing

3422
02:56:42,459 --> 02:56:46,658
it's like wildfire spreading speaking of

3423

02:56:53,738 --> 02:56:56,408

3429
02:56:54,939 --> 02:56:58,540
if you guys know I'm talking about high

3430
02:56:56,408 --> 02:57:00,488
five me mentally right now the firm's

3431
02:56:58,540 --> 02:57:02,050
other leads it bleed advisor is George

3432
02:57:00,488 --> 02:57:04,270
Smitherman Ontario's former health

3433
02:57:02,049 --> 02:57:06,039
minister analysts have suggested that a

3434
02:57:04,270 --> 02:57:07,750
fully legalized marijuana industry could

3435
02:57:06,040 --> 02:57:10,090
attract investors from the alcohol and

3436
02:57:07,750 --> 02:57:11,350
tobacco industries last month addiction

3437
02:57:10,090 --> 02:57:13,090
specialists wrote a piece in The

3438
02:57:11,350 --> 02:57:15,130
Canadian Medical Association Journal

3439
02:57:13,090 --> 02:57:16,960
urging whichever party forms government

3440
02:57:15,129 --> 02:57:19,299
to move away from cannabis prohibition

3441
02:57:16,959 --> 02:57:20,978
but also retained control over the

3442
02:57:19,299 --> 02:57:22,629
supply and sale of recreational

3443
02:57:20,978 --> 02:57:24,849
marijuana should it become legalized

3444
02:57:22,629 --> 02:57:26,769
they frequently side be concerned with

3445
02:57:24,850 --> 02:57:28,840
legalization is that it will allow the

3446
02:57:26,770 --> 02:57:31,479
rise of big cannabis similar to big

3447
02:57:28,840 --> 02:57:33,549
tobacco and big alcohol these powerful

3448
02:57:31,478 --> 02:57:35,528
multinational corporations have revenues

3449
02:57:33,549 --> 02:57:37,959
and market expansion as their primary

3450
02:57:35,529 --> 02:57:39,729
goals with little consideration of the

3451
02:57:37,959 --> 02:57:41,618
impact on public health the article

3452
02:57:39,728 --> 02:57:43,778
states you guys that's something that we

3453
02:57:41,619 --> 02:57:45,790
kind of overlooked here when we started

3454
02:57:43,779 --> 02:57:48,908
writing all of our marijuana laws in

3455
02:57:45,790 --> 02:57:51,729
Colorado in California we kind of forgot

3456
02:57:48,908 --> 02:57:52,670
that big cannabis would take over and I

3457
02:57:51,728 --> 02:57:55,608
see

3458
02:57:52,670 --> 02:57:57,290
that's what's happening here in Colorado

3459
02:57:55,609 --> 02:57:58,850
if you don't have there were tons of

3460
02:57:57,290 --> 02:58:00,439
shops here that were mom-and-pop shops

3461
02:57:58,850 --> 02:58:02,359
guys like myself with some dreadlocks

3462
02:58:00,439 --> 02:58:04,488
and some growing skills but grow our

3463
02:58:02,359 --> 02:58:05,568
hearts out open up a shop and get [ __ ]

3464
02:58:04,488 --> 02:58:07,908
going but then all of the new

3465
02:58:05,568 --> 02:58:09,738
regulations have pushed people in that

3466
02:58:07,908 --> 02:58:11,359
realm out because it is so expensive to

3467
02:58:09,738 --> 02:58:12,859
open up a shop it's so expensive to

3468
02:58:11,359 --> 02:58:14,540
afford all of the security it's so

3469
02:58:12,859 --> 02:58:17,750
expensive to pay for all the licensing

3470
02:58:14,540 --> 02:58:19,520
then only rich dudes that don't know

3471
02:58:17,750 --> 02:58:20,988
anything about cannabis can own

3472
02:58:19,520 --> 02:58:22,729
dispensaries now that is not a hundred

3473
02:58:20,988 --> 02:58:24,049
percent true but that is a lot of what I

3474
02:58:22,728 --> 02:58:25,760
saw happen there are a lot of people

3475
02:58:24,049 --> 02:58:27,438
that held on a lot of people that

3476
02:58:25,760 --> 02:58:30,228
persevered and made it in the industry

3477
02:58:27,439 --> 02:58:31,880
but very few of them survived big shout

3478
02:58:30,228 --> 02:58:34,068
out to Scott reach for making it that

3479
02:58:31,879 --> 02:58:35,599
dude made it from the beginning killing

3480
02:58:34,068 --> 02:58:37,939
it because if you want to be a cannabis

3481
02:58:35,600 --> 02:58:39,620
entrepreneur find out who Scott reaches

3482
02:58:37,939 --> 02:58:41,658
and read about that dude learn how that

3483
02:58:39,620 --> 02:58:43,460
dude did it and you'll realize that you

3484
02:58:41,658 --> 02:58:45,109
can do whatever the hell you want I'm

3485
02:58:43,459 --> 02:58:46,789
gonna continue with the article in

3486
02:58:45,109 --> 02:58:48,199
August judo said his new government

3487
02:58:46,790 --> 02:58:49,640
would look into pardoning Canadians

3488
02:58:48,199 --> 02:58:52,040
serving time in prison for marijuana

3489
02:58:49,639 --> 02:58:53,898
related crimes after he repeals the laws

3490
02:58:52,040 --> 02:58:57,020
in the Criminal Code this dude's gonna

3491
02:58:53,898 --> 02:58:58,789
go and release Canadian serving time in

3492
02:58:57,020 --> 02:59:00,738
prison for marijuana related crimes

3493
02:58:58,790 --> 02:59:01,850
their new prime minister is awesome you

3494
02:59:00,738 --> 02:59:03,198
guys could you imagine if we got a

3495
02:59:01,850 --> 02:59:04,609
president like this in America

3496
02:59:03,199 --> 02:59:05,930
I mean it's highly unlikely but could

3497
02:59:04,609 --> 02:59:07,939
you imagine if that should happen it

3498
02:59:05,930 --> 02:59:10,520
would be so amazing if our president

3499
02:59:07,939 --> 02:59:12,648
actually if our government actually

3500
02:59:10,520 --> 02:59:15,140
governed us in a way that we found

3501
02:59:12,648 --> 02:59:16,309
favorable instead of governing us in a

3502
02:59:15,139 --> 02:59:18,039
way that we all feel like we're getting

3503
02:59:16,309 --> 02:59:21,170
ripped the [ __ ] off and it's only

3504
02:59:18,040 --> 02:59:22,399
benefiting 1% of our nation it'd be

3505
02:59:21,170 --> 02:59:24,228
amazing if they actually felt some

3506
02:59:22,398 --> 02:59:25,608
compassion for us right there's one more

3507
02:59:24,228 --> 02:59:27,349
paragraph in this article you guys I

3508
02:59:25,609 --> 02:59:29,270
will continue there has been many

3509
02:59:27,350 --> 02:59:32,120
situations over history when laws come

3510
02:59:29,270 --> 02:59:34,670
and that overturn laws come in that

3511
02:59:32,120 --> 02:59:36,380
overturn previous convictions he said at

3512
02:59:34,670 --> 02:59:38,540
a campaign stop in Vancouver and there

3513
02:59:36,379 --> 02:59:41,358
will be a process for that that we will

3514
02:59:38,540 --> 02:59:42,590
set up in a responsible way you guys

3515
02:59:41,359 --> 02:59:43,818
also make sure you follow the lady that

3516
02:59:42,590 --> 02:59:46,430
wrote this article or his name her name

3517
02:59:43,818 --> 02:59:48,590
is Rachel Brown she's on Twitter at Rp

3518
02:59:46,430 --> 02:59:53,180
underscore Brown brown with an e at the

3519
02:59:48,590 --> 02:59:55,279
end so Canada has basically legalized

3520
02:59:53,180 --> 02:59:56,960
cannabis this new Prime Minister Trudeau

3521
02:59:55,279 --> 02:59:59,510
Justin Trudeau I hope I'm saying that

3522
02:59:56,959 --> 03:00:01,429
right Justin Trudeau says that when he

3523
02:59:59,510 --> 03:00:03,350
gets into office he's gonna do what he

3524
03:00:01,430 --> 03:00:05,568
can to make cannabis legal you know I

3525
03:00:03,350 --> 03:00:07,970
heard him say I didn't hear him he said

3526
03:00:05,568 --> 03:00:10,068
article that I read there within 18

3527
03:00:07,969 --> 03:00:13,099
