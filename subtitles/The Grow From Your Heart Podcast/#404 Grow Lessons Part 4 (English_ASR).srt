green dot labs

13
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:02,020
once again the label says it is a

14
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:04,448
combination of golden pineapple and jet

15
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:06,819
fuel gelato the flavor on the label is

16
00:01:04,448 --> 00:01:08,858
described as citrus cleaner haze and

17
00:01:06,819 --> 00:01:11,259
fruit cheese I think it tastes just like

18
00:01:08,858 --> 00:01:13,899
a pineapple Fanta I think the flavor and

19
00:01:11,259 --> 00:01:15,670
aroma even include the fizzy part of the

20
00:01:13,899 --> 00:01:17,739
Fanta drink I think it's delicious

21
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:20,879
and amazing on the back of the product

22
00:01:17,739 --> 00:01:24,848
container it says it contains 50 9.81%

23
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:28,929

guys a decent podcast in the last

50
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:36,069
episode I promised another grow lesson

51
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:37,840
if you've been following along you know

52
00:02:36,069 --> 00:02:39,699
I've been doing a long series of grow

53
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,039
lessons the grow series started at

54
00:02:39,699 --> 00:02:44,500
episode 351 if you haven't caught up I

55
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:47,409
suggest you head back to episode 351 an

56
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:49,330
episode 351 we set a goal for our garden

57
00:02:47,409 --> 00:02:51,189
and then we move on to selecting a space

58
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:52,780
for our garden we also select the proper

59
00:02:51,189 --> 00:02:55,329
equipment then we build the grow room

60
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:57,189
then we talk about seeds and clones then

61
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:58,900
we veg our plants then we talk about a

62
00:02:57,189 --> 00:03:01,000
few tricks and tips to get our plants up

63
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:03,129
to speed for quality production and at

64
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,830
this point in my grow lessons it is day

65
00:03:03,129 --> 00:03:08,469
one of flower it is time to flip our

66
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:11,380
crop from the vegetative phase into the

67
00:03:08,469 --> 00:03:12,789
flowering phase of our grow so I'm gonna

68
00:03:11,379 --> 00:03:14,500
press pause for a moment I'm going to

69
00:03:12,789 --> 00:03:16,719
listen back to this intro and see how I

70
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:19,330
sound and when I come back we are going

71
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:21,459
to talk about flowering our new cannabis

72
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:23,260
garden all right podcast world I

73
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:24,789
apologize that I do sound kind of crappy

74
00:03:23,259 --> 00:03:26,739
but the show must go on I've been

75
00:03:24,789 --> 00:03:28,419
promising this episode I may make this

76
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:30,819
one kind of quick and then recap next

77
00:03:28,419 --> 00:03:33,309
week and move forward my original idea

78
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:35,169
was to do a three week chunk of

79
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:36,969
flowering episodes we would do week one

80
00:03:35,169 --> 00:03:39,009
through three and then four through six

81
00:03:36,969 --> 00:03:41,259
and seven through nine but we were going

82
00:03:39,009 --> 00:03:42,699
to focus on day one of week one today

83
00:03:41,259 --> 00:03:44,979
and then we will adjust from there in

84
00:03:42,699 --> 00:03:47,500
the following episodes so let's get

85
00:03:44,979 --> 00:03:49,719
started on flowering our cannabis garden

86
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:52,539
what do I mean by flowering we want to

87
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:54,699
initiate the budding phase the flowering

88
00:03:52,539 --> 00:03:56,889
phase for regular cannabis plants is

89
00:03:54,699 --> 00:03:59,048
triggered by reducing the light cycle if

90
00:03:56,889 --> 00:04:01,000
you were working with Otto flower plants

91
00:03:59,049 --> 00:04:03,069
you are in a total different ballgame

92
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,169
those plants will flower when they are

93
00:04:03,069 --> 00:04:07,629
ready for this discussion we're going to

94
00:04:05,169 --> 00:04:09,699
focus on regular photoperiod plants and

95
00:04:07,629 --> 00:04:11,819
photoperiod seeds so let's talk about

96
00:04:09,699 --> 00:04:14,469
flowering our photoperiod garden

97
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:17,108
initiating flower is very easy all we do

98
00:04:14,469 --> 00:04:19,959
is reduce the timer to 12 hours on and

99
00:04:17,108 --> 00:04:22,810
12 hours off we need 12 hours of

100
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:25,180
uninterrupted darkness every day to

101
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:26,949
trigger these plants to flower I've set

102
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,930
up several times but I'm going to repeat

103
00:04:26,949 --> 00:04:30,779
myself we

104
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:33,090
need total uninterrupted darkness during

105
00:04:30,779 --> 00:04:35,788
the night phase for our flowering plants

106
00:04:33,089 --> 00:04:37,888
a little bit of light is too much if you

107
00:04:35,788 --> 00:04:40,469
can see a pinprick of light coming in

108
00:04:37,889 --> 00:04:42,090
that room it is too much light if you

109
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:44,250
can see your hand in front of your face

110
00:04:42,089 --> 00:04:46,138
during the dark phase in that room it is

111
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:47,850
too much light those plants know that

112
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:49,620
that light is there they will not go to

113
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:51,689
sleep properly they will not flower

114
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:53,459
properly if they do try to flower

115
00:04:51,689 --> 00:04:55,469
properly you give them the chance of

116
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:57,538
hermaphroditic on you in mid flower

117
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:59,460
which will produce seeds in your garden

118
00:04:57,538 --> 00:05:01,949
which will ruin your whole goal so we

119
00:04:59,459 --> 00:05:04,709
need 100 percent total darkness in our

120
00:05:01,949 --> 00:05:06,210
flowering room during the night phase so

121
00:05:04,709 --> 00:05:08,638
switch the timer to 1212

122
00:05:06,209 --> 00:05:10,228
be sure that you have got total dark in

123
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,120
that dark phase you need to go in there

124
00:05:10,228 --> 00:05:14,310
and look you probably need to hang out

125
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:16,139
in the grow room for about 15 to 20

126
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:19,168
minutes for your eyes to adjust properly

127
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:21,150
to identify the most minimal light leaks

128
00:05:19,168 --> 00:05:23,008
you could possibly have so go in there

129
00:05:21,149 --> 00:05:25,319
and check for light leaks on day 1 of

130
00:05:23,009 --> 00:05:27,479
flower if you have any light coming in

131
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:29,969
you need to correct that that will ruin

132
00:05:27,478 --> 00:05:32,310
your garden so we've set the timer to

133
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:35,370
1212 now it is on for 12 hours a day and

134
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:37,319
it is off for 12 hours a day put a lot

135
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:39,269
of thought into the hours which your

136
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:40,560
lights run do you want those lights to

137
00:05:39,269 --> 00:05:42,209
come on in the morning when you wake up

138
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,680
so you can water the plants before you

139
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:45,060
go to work and then the plants are on

140
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,470
all day while you're gone at work

141
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,120
hopefully you get to come home and check

142
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:50,280
them out before the lights turn off or

143
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,629
do you want those lights to come on in

144
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:53,158
the evening right when you get home from

145
00:05:51,629 --> 00:05:54,629
work and the lights can run all night

146
00:05:53,158 --> 00:05:56,339
while your home and you can check on

147
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:57,658
everything maybe you can get up before

148
00:05:56,339 --> 00:05:58,978
work and they're still on you can check

149
00:05:57,658 --> 00:06:00,689
on them again before you go to work and

150
00:05:58,978 --> 00:06:02,158
make sure everything's cool I would put

151
00:06:00,689 --> 00:06:04,259
a lot of thought into scheduling my

152
00:06:02,158 --> 00:06:05,370
flowering cycle another thing to

153
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:07,259
consider while you're planning your

154
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:10,408
schedule is electricity is cheaper

155
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:12,060
during off-peak hours that means that

156
00:06:10,408 --> 00:06:13,889
during the evenings when everybody goes

157
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:15,810
home and they're chilling electricity

158
00:06:13,889 --> 00:06:17,879
gets cheaper during the daytime business

159
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:19,620
hours when everybody's using all the

160
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:21,538
electricity The Electric Company does

161
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:24,000
charge you more for those peak hours

162
00:06:21,538 --> 00:06:26,158
what many folks will choose to do is run

163
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,560
those lights during off-peak hours and

164
00:06:26,158 --> 00:06:30,990
save money on electricity this is also

165
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,579
advantageous because it is cooler during

166
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:34,439
the evening so you don't have the Sun up

167
00:06:32,579 --> 00:06:36,180
keeping your grow room extra hot you're

168
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:37,978
not heating the outside with the Sun and

169
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:39,240
the inside with the grow lights the Sun

170
00:06:37,978 --> 00:06:40,909
Goes Down and gets a little cooler

171
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,560
outside you can use that cool

172
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:44,960
outside air to your advantage and keep

173
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,180
the grow room cool so think about your

174
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:49,279
scheduling when do you want that 12:12

175
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:52,639
on cycle to be when do you want that

176
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:54,559
12:12 off cycle to be if you do decide

177
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:57,110
to run your lights at night and have

178
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:59,839
your dark cycle during the natural light

179
00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:02,300
cycle be sure that no sunshine is

180
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:04,459
creeping into your grow room during that

181
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:06,319
night cycle again we need total darkness

182
00:07:04,459 --> 00:07:08,479
a very common mistake is that people

183
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,860
flower their plants at night which means

184
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11,840
they're in the sleep cycle during the

185
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:14,120
day which means there's the opportunity

186
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:15,709
for the sunshine to sneak into your grow

187
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:17,420
room if you've got a window if you've

188
00:07:15,709 --> 00:07:19,430
got a doorway if you've got some kind of

189
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:21,050
insecure structure you can get light in

190
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:22,699
there very easily and it will destroy

191
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:24,079
your crop so you've thought about

192
00:07:22,699 --> 00:07:25,550
scheduling and you know how it's going

193
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:26,599
to work around your work schedule you

194
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:27,770
know how it's gonna work around your

195
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,180
life and you know when you're going to

196
00:07:27,769 --> 00:07:30,680
flower these plants you know when you'll

197
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:32,600
have time to give them maintenance and

198
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:34,610
work on them and water them so plan your

199
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:36,860
scheduling around that so we have set

200
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:39,860
the timer to twelve twelve that is day

201
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:43,069
one of flower that first short day is

202
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:44,900
day one right that day down too many

203
00:07:43,069 --> 00:07:46,250
people forget to write that down and

204
00:07:44,899 --> 00:07:47,209
they don't know how long their plants

205
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:50,379
have been in flower

206
00:07:47,209 --> 00:07:52,459
write down your flowering start date

207
00:07:50,379 --> 00:07:55,339
another thing I want to make clear is

208
00:07:52,459 --> 00:07:57,859
this is day one of flower if you've got

209
00:07:55,339 --> 00:08:00,229
a package of seeds and it says takes 70

210
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:02,660
to 80 days to flower this is the first

211
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:05,000
day of that 70 to 80 days of that

212
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:06,919
finishing time a lot of folks like to

213
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,470
start the flowering phase when they see

214
00:08:06,918 --> 00:08:11,899
bud set starting when they see pre

215
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:13,490
flowers you are 12 days into flower by

216
00:08:11,899 --> 00:08:16,339
then and you were ripping yourself off

217
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:19,340
flowering starts the day we changed the

218
00:08:16,339 --> 00:08:21,589
timer to 1212 that is day one of flower

219
00:08:19,339 --> 00:08:23,239
so we've now switched the timer to 1212

220
00:08:21,589 --> 00:08:25,609
the plants will be on for 12 hours a day

221
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:27,230
and off for 12 hours they are going to

222
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:29,090
start flowering let's talk about the

223
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:31,610
environmental conditions we need to

224
00:08:29,089 --> 00:08:33,889
provide for our flowering plants here at

225
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:35,779
the beginning of flower this will change

226
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:36,979
as the plants progress right now we

227
00:08:35,779 --> 00:08:39,228
don't have any buds to worry about

228
00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:41,270
they're much less opportunities for

229
00:08:39,229 --> 00:08:42,889
mildew and molds to take hold because

230
00:08:41,269 --> 00:08:44,659
when you get those chunky buds the

231
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:46,279
mildew likes to start in the middle of

232
00:08:44,659 --> 00:08:48,079
those buds that's not really a worry

233
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:49,459
right now so we can have the humidity a

234
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,870
little higher at this point we can have

235
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:52,820
the temps a little higher at this point

236
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:54,269
but as we progress we are going to lower

237
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:56,070
the humidity and the temperature

238
00:08:54,269 --> 00:08:58,019
in our flowering room to accommodate

239
00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:01,320
those big chunky buds and to prevent

240
00:08:58,019 --> 00:09:02,939
problems so at this phase of the game it

241
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:06,089
would be ideal to have your grow room

242
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:08,399
between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit I

243
00:09:06,089 --> 00:09:10,890
do not recommend higher than 80 I do not

244
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,419
recommend lower than 70 I understand

245
00:09:10,889 --> 00:09:14,549
that you're struggling to keep your room

246
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:17,579
cool a lot of new growers have issues

247
00:09:14,549 --> 00:09:19,919
keeping the grow room cool 84 is the max

248
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:22,080
you ever want to hit when you hit 85

249
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:24,449
degrees in higher your plants will stop

250
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:27,180
producing they will just go into a

251
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:28,680
stagnant dead slowdown mode how

252
00:09:27,179 --> 00:09:30,239
productive do you want to be when it's

253
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:31,559
110 degrees outside

254
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,700
you just feel like [ __ ] you don't want

255
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:35,219
to do anything you don't want to move

256
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:36,959
the plants feel the same way the plants

257
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:38,370
can't move themselves to some shade the

258
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:40,379
plants can't grab some water and take a

259
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:42,389
drink those plants are stuck there so

260
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:45,088
give them the proper environment don't

261
00:09:42,389 --> 00:09:46,769
go too hot don't go too cold at this

262
00:09:45,089 --> 00:09:49,320
phase of the flowering cycle I would

263
00:09:46,769 --> 00:09:52,949
recommend 70 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit

264
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:54,870
during your lights on cycle now let's

265
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:56,759
talk a little bit about the humidity of

266
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:58,350
this grow room during the start of the

267
00:09:56,759 --> 00:10:01,110
flowering phase I like to have about

268
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:02,700
forty to fifty percent humidity earlier

269
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:04,320
I said we don't have those big buds to

270
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,820
worry about so we've just got a bunch of

271
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,410
lush happy plants they're just in there

272
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:09,690
sucking up all that humidity and growing

273
00:10:07,409 --> 00:10:12,120
like crazy so forty to fifty percent

274
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:15,690
relative humidity and seventy to eighty

275
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:17,610
degrees during your daytime cycle if you

276
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:19,200
really want to dial that in I recommend

277
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:21,360
you check out my episode about vapor

278
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,339
pressure deficit and that was episode

279
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,990
number 314 if you're interested in

280
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:26,700
learning more about the vapor pressure

281
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:28,620
deficit which I find to be very

282
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,820
important when it comes to dialing in

283
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:32,220
the grow room perfectly

284
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:34,320
VPD will really improve the productivity

285
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:36,660
of your plants if you understand it and

286
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,550
dial it in correctly so that is the

287
00:10:36,659 --> 00:10:40,469
daytime condition we want 70 to 80

288
00:10:38,549 --> 00:10:42,419
degrees during the day forty to fifty

289
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:44,399
percent relative humidity let's talk

290
00:10:42,419 --> 00:10:45,958
about the nighttime temperatures when we

291
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,000
turn off the white things are going to

292
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:49,229
change in that grow room I try to keep

293
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,850
the humidity right around the same

294
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:52,500
levels at nighttime at this stage of

295
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:54,690
flowering I want that forty to fifty

296
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,820
percent humidity during the night cycle

297
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:58,890
now during the night cycle I like it to

298
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:00,629
get a little bit cooler it naturally

299
00:10:58,889 --> 00:11:02,429
cools off at night so I feel like the

300
00:11:00,629 --> 00:11:04,559
plants probably enjoy a little bit

301
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:07,319
cooler of a temperature at night I try

302
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:09,029
not to go any more than ten degrees

303
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:11,220
these different on a day-and-night

304
00:11:09,029 --> 00:11:13,019
temperature that is called your diurnal

305
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:15,690
temperature variation and you don't want

306
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:18,389
that to sway more than ten degrees so if

307
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:20,070
during your day cycle here at 75 you do

308
00:11:18,389 --> 00:11:23,639
not want your night cycle to get any

309
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:25,260
lower than 65 degrees I would generally

310
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:27,419
try to keep it about 5 degrees

311
00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:29,100
difference but I understand we're

312
00:11:27,419 --> 00:11:30,809
building new grow rooms we are learning

313
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:33,570
our setups we are learning to dial these

314
00:11:30,809 --> 00:11:36,539
rooms in 5 to 10 degrees is acceptable

315
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:38,480
for a diurnal temperature variation but

316
00:11:36,539 --> 00:11:40,169
if you go any more than 5 to 10 degrees

317
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,639
differential in your day and night

318
00:11:40,169 --> 00:11:43,589
temperature you will cause problems

319
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:45,330
within the plants the plants will be

320
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:47,129
confused the plants will begin to grow

321
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:49,620
slowly and this is also a great way to

322
00:11:47,129 --> 00:11:51,269
invite powdery mildew so try to keep

323
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:52,799
your temperature swings within 10

324
00:11:51,269 --> 00:11:54,449
degrees from your day and nighttime

325
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:56,639
temperature now when you're walking

326
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:58,350
through the grow sometimes just reach

327
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,269
out and grab a plant and feel the

328
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:02,340
temperature of the plant as the plant

329
00:12:00,269 --> 00:12:04,529
warm is the plant cold how does the

330
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:06,240
plant feel to your hands if the plants

331
00:12:04,529 --> 00:12:07,679
feel really really cold they're probably

332
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,750
really cold and you could probably

333
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:11,129
increase the temperature of your room if

334
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:13,230
the plants feel like they're warm

335
00:12:11,129 --> 00:12:15,330
they're probably warm you can probably

336
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:17,550
lower the temperature of your room in

337
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:19,379
the future I do plan to do a discussion

338
00:12:17,549 --> 00:12:21,419
on leaf surface temperature versus

339
00:12:19,379 --> 00:12:23,700
ambient room temperature but we are not

340
00:12:21,419 --> 00:12:25,139
there yet so let's stay focused here now

341
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:27,060
one thing I may have overlooked when I

342
00:12:25,139 --> 00:12:29,610
talked about equipment is a hydrometer

343
00:12:27,059 --> 00:12:30,509
and a thermometer or some sort of a

344
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:32,820
monitoring device

345
00:12:30,509 --> 00:12:34,259
to know what is happening in our grow

346
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:36,450
room at all times

347
00:12:34,259 --> 00:12:38,909
most of us growers can probably afford

348
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:40,620
the hydrometer thermometer combo that

349
00:12:38,909 --> 00:12:43,049
sits in the grow room and it marks the

350
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:44,970
humidity and temperature of the room but

351
00:12:43,049 --> 00:12:46,889
it will also mark the highest and lowest

352
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:48,330
points of your humidity and temperatures

353
00:12:46,889 --> 00:12:50,460
so you can find your peaks and your

354
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:52,860
valleys and identify the temperature and

355
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:54,300
humidity fluctuations in your room it's

356
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:56,129
always nice to know where the peaks and

357
00:12:54,299 --> 00:12:57,629
valleys are but I like to have more data

358
00:12:56,129 --> 00:12:59,070
I like to have something in the room

359
00:12:57,629 --> 00:13:01,620
that can tell me what's going on at all

360
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:03,210
times for a reliable monitor that can

361
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:04,620
keep you up-to-date on what's happening

362
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:06,269
in your grow room at all times

363
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:08,759
I would suggest something like a Pio

364
00:13:06,269 --> 00:13:11,189
grow systems minder unit or perhaps a

365
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:12,929
smart bee unit you can use both of those

366
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:14,820
units to monitor your grow room at all

367
00:13:12,929 --> 00:13:16,469
times you can pull up the data on your

368
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:18,540
phone you can see what's happening in

369
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:19,889
the room in real time some of these

370
00:13:18,539 --> 00:13:21,179
types of units allow you to actually

371
00:13:19,889 --> 00:13:23,309
plug in other two

372
00:13:21,179 --> 00:13:24,959
and trigger them from your smartphone so

373
00:13:23,309 --> 00:13:26,669
if you were away you open up your

374
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:28,230
application you see that it's too warm

375
00:13:26,669 --> 00:13:29,639
in that room you can say hey let's just

376
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:30,930
easily turn on the air-conditioner you

377
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:32,370
can click a button on a tab on your

378
00:13:30,929 --> 00:13:33,839
phone and it will fire up the

379
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:35,909
air-conditioner in your grow room and

380
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:37,470
you can rescue your garden while you're

381
00:13:35,909 --> 00:13:38,639
at lunch hanging out with your friends

382
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:41,070
and you don't even have to leave the

383
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:43,559
table so my point is have some way to

384
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:45,450
monitor the temperature and humidity in

385
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:47,039
your grow room at all times I like to

386
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,970
have a report of what happens when those

387
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:49,589
lights go off

388
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:51,600
you've been running that grill light for

389
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:52,950
12 hours in that room you have created a

390
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,960
lot of heat you have created a lot of

391
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:56,640
energy all of that heat all of that

392
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:58,740
light energy has created humidity

393
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,299
there's water rising up in the air now

394
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:01,919
when we kill that light everything

395
00:14:00,299 --> 00:14:03,990
changes all of that humidity in the air

396
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:05,729
is no longer being heated it's got the

397
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:07,470
opportunity to start falling it becomes

398
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:08,820
kind of thick in the grow room that

399
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:11,100
short time period while the room

400
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:14,040
stabilizes itself out from that change

401
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:16,889
is quite often the cause of many of our

402
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:19,259
powdery mildew and botrytis issues and

403
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:20,789
many growers don't even know that that

404
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:22,409
is happening in the room at that time

405
00:14:20,789 --> 00:14:24,179
they look at their hygrometer they look

406
00:14:22,409 --> 00:14:26,309
at their thermometer they say oh it was

407
00:14:24,179 --> 00:14:28,529
72 degrees in here that's acceptable oh

408
00:14:26,309 --> 00:14:30,299
it was 45% humidity in here that's

409
00:14:28,529 --> 00:14:33,149
acceptable you don't realize that there

410
00:14:30,299 --> 00:14:35,639
was a point where it was 78 degrees and

411
00:14:33,149 --> 00:14:37,379
about 82% humidity in the room and

412
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:38,939
that's because we turned off that light

413
00:14:37,379 --> 00:14:40,919
all that moisture that was in the air is

414
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:42,420
now falling now the plants don't have

415
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:43,769
light anymore so they are starting to

416
00:14:42,419 --> 00:14:45,629
respirate a little bit they're letting

417
00:14:43,769 --> 00:14:47,549
out a little more moisture and all of

418
00:14:45,629 --> 00:14:49,350
that chaos can really cause problems for

419
00:14:47,549 --> 00:14:51,569
our plants in that type of environment

420
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:53,580
so my point is try to know what's

421
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:56,010
happening environmentally in your rooms

422
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:57,930
at all times all right it feels like we

423
00:14:56,009 --> 00:14:59,639
know what our environment should be like

424
00:14:57,929 --> 00:15:02,789
let's talk a little bit about feeding

425
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:04,500
our transitioning cannabis plants if you

426
00:15:02,789 --> 00:15:06,299
are working in a no-till bed or you're

427
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:08,220
working with super soil there's no need

428
00:15:06,299 --> 00:15:09,419
to adjust anything at this time just

429
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:11,009
keep doing what you're doing you

430
00:15:09,419 --> 00:15:13,379
basically need to water the plants

431
00:15:11,009 --> 00:15:15,299
throughout the flowering cycle if you

432
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:17,100
plan on adding a cover crop or a top

433
00:15:15,299 --> 00:15:19,079
dress or maybe feeding some teas you

434
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:21,360
will need to adjust your teas at this

435
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:23,310
time I would take the nitrogen products

436
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,740
out and focus more on the phosphorus and

437
00:15:23,309 --> 00:15:28,500
potassium at this time if you're running

438
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:30,149
teas or top dress or a cover crop now if

439
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:32,250
you are working with bottled nutrients

440
00:15:30,149 --> 00:15:34,120
you can probably just swap out that veg

441
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:36,759
bottle and replace it with the flow

442
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:38,500
in nutrients most of the bottle nutrient

443
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:40,990
companies make it very easy to follow

444
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:42,820
their nutrient schedule so simply swap

445
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:44,350
out that veg bottle put in the bloom

446
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:46,570
bottle and everything should be good to

447
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:48,129
go the main difference in our feeding

448
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:49,960
schedule at this time is that we are

449
00:15:48,129 --> 00:15:51,460
going to reduce the amount of nitrogen

450
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:53,650
and we are going to slowly start

451
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:55,810
increasing the amount of phosphorus and

452
00:15:53,649 --> 00:15:58,088
potassium our plants take up

453
00:15:55,809 --> 00:16:00,519
approximately 80 to 90 percent of their

454
00:15:58,089 --> 00:16:02,110
nitrogen during the veg phase once we

455
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:04,088
switch them into flour they are done

456
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:05,500
sucking up nitrogen and they want more

457
00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:07,420
phosphorous and potassium

458
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:09,940
so they can build robust branches and

459
00:16:07,419 --> 00:16:11,588
big fat buds so let's reduce the

460
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:14,080
nitrogen and start increasing the

461
00:16:11,589 --> 00:16:16,120
phosphorus and potassium that part

462
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:18,550
should mostly be covered by your base

463
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:21,009
nutrients if you're running a one bottle

464
00:16:18,549 --> 00:16:23,049
based nutrient a 2-part or a 3-part you

465
00:16:21,009 --> 00:16:25,450
should be getting the proper nitrogen

466
00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:27,429
phosphorus and potassium from your base

467
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:29,050
nutrients now there are a few more

468
00:16:27,429 --> 00:16:31,689
things that these plants can use at this

469
00:16:29,049 --> 00:16:33,549
phase I like to add silica when I am

470
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:35,440
mixing up my nutrient solution I always

471
00:16:33,549 --> 00:16:38,019
put potassium silicates in the water

472
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:40,870
first the potassium silicates go first

473
00:16:38,019 --> 00:16:42,789
then I mix in my base nutrients these

474
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:44,799
plants can probably use cal-mag at this

475
00:16:42,789 --> 00:16:46,750
point in time I also like to give the

476
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:48,669
plants some sort of a root inoculant

477
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:50,620
early in Flour don't cut back the

478
00:16:48,669 --> 00:16:52,419
microbes keep them going keep those

479
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:54,339
roots growing strong keep them healthy

480
00:16:52,419 --> 00:16:57,009
the plants will continue to flourish in

481
00:16:54,339 --> 00:16:59,860
flower I also like some enzymes those

482
00:16:57,009 --> 00:17:01,629
enzymes serve several purposes the

483
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:03,490
enzymes will basically help to keep the

484
00:17:01,629 --> 00:17:05,380
root zone clean and they will also break

485
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:08,109
down any decaying root matter and turn

486
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:10,449
that into usable energy for my plants I

487
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:11,979
also like to add some carbohydrates the

488
00:17:10,449 --> 00:17:15,279
carbohydrates serve a couple of purposes

489
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:17,078
those carbs will feed my microbes those

490
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:19,808
carbs will also give my plants energy

491
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:22,119
between the carbs the enzymes and the

492
00:17:19,808 --> 00:17:24,730
mykos my root zone is really healthy and

493
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:27,250
really active which will show up top at

494
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:29,410
the top of our plants so we are focusing

495
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:31,329
on nitrogen phosphorus and potassium at

496
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:32,890
this stage we are shifting away from the

497
00:17:31,329 --> 00:17:34,539
nitrogen more toward the phosphorus and

498
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:36,820
potassium it's always good to add

499
00:17:34,539 --> 00:17:39,369
cal-mag a little bit of a root inoculant

500
00:17:36,819 --> 00:17:41,710
I like some enzymes always some carbs

501
00:17:39,369 --> 00:17:44,079
and to make everything pop I would add a

502
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:45,880
little bit of fulvic acid now if you've

503
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:47,079
chosen to work with a specific bottled

504
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,970
nutrient company

505
00:17:47,079 --> 00:17:50,798
most of those companies have a nutrient

506
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:53,440
calculator on their website so you can

507
00:17:50,798 --> 00:17:55,329
go to whatever nutrient company.com you

508
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,919
can find their nutrient calculator you

509
00:17:55,329 --> 00:17:58,990
can type in how many weeks are going to

510
00:17:56,919 --> 00:18:00,340
flower you can click on which products

511
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:02,919
of theirs you have purchased and it will

512
00:18:00,339 --> 00:18:05,829
tell you week by week how much of each

513
00:18:02,919 --> 00:18:08,019
product to use most of those charts are

514
00:18:05,829 --> 00:18:10,210
reliable but keep in mind they want you

515
00:18:08,019 --> 00:18:12,190
to continue buying products so they may

516
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:14,970
recommend you use a little more than

517
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:18,159
necessary for an ideal crop situation I

518
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:21,639
generally reduce the recommended dosage

519
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:23,919
by about 25 percent if it says to feed

520
00:18:21,638 --> 00:18:26,138
100 milliliters of your base product I

521
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:28,630
would start off with 75 milliliters and

522
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:30,369
see what happens we can always feed the

523
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:31,990
plants a little more later but we can

524
00:18:30,369 --> 00:18:34,388
never take out the feeding once we've

525
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:35,859
put it in so don't burn the plants wait

526
00:18:34,388 --> 00:18:37,599
for them to show you that they are happy

527
00:18:35,859 --> 00:18:38,168
or that they're angry and adjust from

528
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:40,388
there

529
00:18:38,169 --> 00:18:42,340
most of these nutrient companies offer a

530
00:18:40,388 --> 00:18:43,928
fairly balanced diet within their own

531
00:18:42,339 --> 00:18:45,759
product line you shouldn't have to reach

532
00:18:43,929 --> 00:18:47,110
out to another brand or another company

533
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:50,648
and fill in anything that they are

534
00:18:47,109 --> 00:18:52,898
missing if you do choose to mix nutrient

535
00:18:50,648 --> 00:18:55,178
lines be very careful that you don't

536
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:57,250
double up on anything when nutrient

537
00:18:55,179 --> 00:18:58,929
company a made their product lines they

538
00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:00,609
made 5 bottles and they put the base

539
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:02,649
notes in one they put the cal mag in the

540
00:19:00,609 --> 00:19:04,569
other they put the humic acid in another

541
00:19:02,648 --> 00:19:06,069
and a bloom booster in another they know

542
00:19:04,569 --> 00:19:07,720
what is in each bottle and they can

543
00:19:06,069 --> 00:19:09,519
recommend your feeding because they know

544
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:12,370
they're not going to overdose anything

545
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:14,859
with their design when you introduce a

546
00:19:12,369 --> 00:19:16,898
product from another company you run the

547
00:19:14,859 --> 00:19:19,240
risk of doubling up on specific

548
00:19:16,898 --> 00:19:21,339
nutrients nutrient company a and

549
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:23,440
nutrient company B did not talk to each

550
00:19:21,339 --> 00:19:25,298
other about their designs so you may be

551
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,159
running a base product from nutrient

552
00:19:25,298 --> 00:19:29,349
company a then you may have a bloom

553
00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:31,600
booster from nutrient company B those

554
00:19:29,349 --> 00:19:33,250
companies didn't talk company a was

555
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:34,898
putting cal-mag inside their base

556
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:37,058
nutrient to help you out and save you

557
00:19:34,898 --> 00:19:38,768
with the bottle company B was putting

558
00:19:37,058 --> 00:19:40,210
the Cal mag inside the bloom boosters to

559
00:19:38,769 --> 00:19:41,769
help you out and save a bottle and you

560
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:43,659
didn't know that so now you just spent

561
00:19:41,769 --> 00:19:45,490
two doses of Cal mag because you

562
00:19:43,659 --> 00:19:47,350
combined nutrient companies and didn't

563
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:49,089
read the bottles so if you choose to use

564
00:19:47,349 --> 00:19:51,339
products from two different companies be

565
00:19:49,089 --> 00:19:53,589
sure not to overlap with any nutrients

566
00:19:51,339 --> 00:19:55,359
if you know what's in each product and

567
00:19:53,589 --> 00:19:56,740
you understand how the plants use each

568
00:19:55,359 --> 00:19:58,459
of those products and you're not going

569
00:19:56,740 --> 00:20:00,349
to cause any problems there is nothing

570
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:02,329
wrong with combining nutrient companies

571
00:20:00,349 --> 00:20:03,769
if you feel like the brand you were

572
00:20:02,329 --> 00:20:05,389
using is lacking something

573
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:07,279
feel free to purchase another product

574
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:09,800
from another company and add that into

575
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:12,440
your mix as long as you don't double up

576
00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:13,700
any specific elements a good example of

577
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:15,470
what I'm talking about is in a

578
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:18,590
commercial environment I like to run veg

579
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:20,480
bloom powder nutrients in my opinion veg

580
00:20:18,589 --> 00:20:23,179
bloom could use a little bit of fulvic

581
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,589
acid added to the mix in my opinion veg

582
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:26,660
bloom can use a little bit of

583
00:20:24,589 --> 00:20:28,639
carbohydrates add it to the mix later in

584
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:30,650
Flour so I am comfortable adding those

585
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,330
products and I've done my research I

586
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:34,850
know how much carbs I know how much

587
00:20:32,329 --> 00:20:36,679
fulvic acid is in my starting product so

588
00:20:34,849 --> 00:20:38,899
I know that I'm not going to overdose my

589
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:40,610
plants alright I'm confident that we

590
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:41,930
understand the environment I'm confident

591
00:20:40,609 --> 00:20:43,579
that we understand what to feed the

592
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:45,650
plants let's talk about some more

593
00:20:43,579 --> 00:20:47,869
techniques to do at the very start of

594
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:50,480
flower if you are using sprayed

595
00:20:47,869 --> 00:20:53,299
pesticide applications now is a great

596
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,259
time to apply a pesticide application we

597
00:20:53,299 --> 00:20:56,119
are running out of time

598
00:20:54,259 --> 00:20:58,190
for sprays we are going to start

599
00:20:56,119 --> 00:21:00,889
developing bud sites very soon so we

600
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:03,230
need to treat these plants today let's

601
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:05,420
apply a preventive product to our plants

602
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:07,730
to ensure we do not get any pests in our

603
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:09,710
veg cycle if you are not going to use

604
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:11,509
spray pesticide applications now is a

605
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:13,220
good time to release your beneficial

606
00:21:11,509 --> 00:21:15,680
insects we want to get them colonized

607
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:18,049
and built up in the grow before other

608
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:20,180
insects have an opportunity to take hold

609
00:21:18,049 --> 00:21:21,799
in our flowering garden once the plants

610
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:24,140
are flowering we don't have a lot of

611
00:21:21,799 --> 00:21:26,690
options for pest control so let's do

612
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:29,390
everything we can now to prevent a pest

613
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:31,910
infestation while we have big chunky

614
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:34,220
buds so I would treat for pests at this

615
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:36,620
time spray pesticides if that is your

616
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:38,930
approach another thing I like to do on

617
00:21:36,619 --> 00:21:40,969
day one a flower is trellis my plants in

618
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:43,460
a commercial environment I am NOT able

619
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:45,769
to move my veg plants into a room and

620
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:47,509
trellis them I have a veg room and I

621
00:21:45,769 --> 00:21:49,849
have flowering rooms the flowering rooms

622
00:21:47,509 --> 00:21:52,129
are constantly flowering so I can't veg

623
00:21:49,849 --> 00:21:54,169
in that room so I moved the plant into

624
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:56,900
the flowering area and I put the trellis

625
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:58,820
up on day one and I bend and pop and

626
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:01,640
work those plants into the net on day

627
00:21:58,819 --> 00:22:03,649
one this gives them plenty of time to

628
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:05,780
recover from the stress of getting beat

629
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:07,850
up while they transition to the

630
00:22:05,779 --> 00:22:08,720
flowering phase we've got about seven to

631
00:22:07,849 --> 00:22:10,219
ten days where they're just

632
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,259
transitioning there won't be anybody

633
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:14,029
won't be any major activity

634
00:22:12,259 --> 00:22:16,129
so if we beat them up on day one we've

635
00:22:14,029 --> 00:22:17,509
got plenty of time to recover so I like

636
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:20,600
to get in there and get them under the

637
00:22:17,509 --> 00:22:22,669
trellis I also do popping and twisting

638
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:24,469
which is also known as super cropping

639
00:22:22,669 --> 00:22:25,970
I've talked about this in depth in other

640
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:29,000
episodes but I'll give you a quick

641
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:30,500
rundown I start at the very bottom stalk

642
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,919
of the plant where it comes out of the

643
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,539
dirt

644
00:22:30,919 --> 00:22:34,850
I grab the base of the stalk with my

645
00:22:32,539 --> 00:22:36,859
left hand I put my right hand above that

646
00:22:34,849 --> 00:22:39,678
and I grab the stock and I twist my

647
00:22:36,859 --> 00:22:41,839
right hand counterclockwise you'll hear

648
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:43,190
a pop sounds kind of like a knuckle

649
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:44,509
popping I pop my knuckle into the

650
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:46,548
microphone I don't know if it picked up

651
00:22:44,509 --> 00:22:48,289
you'll hear a little pop sound that is

652
00:22:46,548 --> 00:22:50,720
the sound you're looking for you just

653
00:22:48,289 --> 00:22:53,569
want to break the cellulose structure of

654
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,250
that plant so I'll break it once then

655
00:22:53,569 --> 00:22:56,808
I'll move my left hand from the bottom

656
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:58,548
right up above my right hand and I'll

657
00:22:56,808 --> 00:23:00,558
give it another break then I'll move up

658
00:22:58,548 --> 00:23:02,660
and give it another break I work my way

659
00:23:00,558 --> 00:23:04,399
up the main stem all the way until it

660
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:06,279
gets real thin and I feel like I could

661
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:09,230
cause problems by snapping it up there

662
00:23:06,279 --> 00:23:10,399
once I've done the main stalk I go back

663
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:12,349
down to the bottom of the plant and I

664
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,600
find the lowest branch and I work that

665
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:16,969
branch all the way up then I work every

666
00:23:14,599 --> 00:23:19,039
single branch on every single plant this

667
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:21,079
takes hours in a commercial environment

668
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:22,789
your hands will be sore but the plants

669
00:23:21,079 --> 00:23:24,079
will thank you for it in the future

670
00:23:22,789 --> 00:23:25,548
right now they look like they got

671
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:27,710
twisted they got a little bit beat up

672
00:23:25,548 --> 00:23:29,480
but in a few days all of those twists

673
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:31,700
will create what looks like a knuckle it

674
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:33,200
will make the plant more robust it will

675
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:35,058
make it stronger it will give it more

676
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,798
strength I feel like those thicker

677
00:23:35,058 --> 00:23:38,418
stalks can move more nutrients which

678
00:23:36,798 --> 00:23:40,039
makes a more productive plant I feel

679
00:23:38,419 --> 00:23:42,830
like a bigger stock and hold up a bigger

680
00:23:40,039 --> 00:23:45,259
bud so we're working those plants to be

681
00:23:42,829 --> 00:23:47,269
more robust by cracking them they heal

682
00:23:45,259 --> 00:23:48,919
themselves and they become stronger so I

683
00:23:47,269 --> 00:23:51,019
like to do popping and twisting at this

684
00:23:48,919 --> 00:23:54,110
time I also like to do a nice

685
00:23:51,019 --> 00:23:56,089
defoliation on day one of flower take

686
00:23:54,109 --> 00:23:58,099
out all that excess leaf we don't need

687
00:23:56,089 --> 00:24:00,349
it while I'm there I like to clean up

688
00:23:58,099 --> 00:24:02,418
the bottoms quite a bit take off some of

689
00:24:00,349 --> 00:24:04,250
the crappy bottom branches take off some

690
00:24:02,419 --> 00:24:06,110
of those sucker branches take off all

691
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:08,000
the bottom leaves we don't need a lot of

692
00:24:06,109 --> 00:24:09,769
that crap on the bottom of our plants

693
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,720
some people like to wait a little bit

694
00:24:09,769 --> 00:24:13,519
later closer to week two to do the

695
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:15,079
bottoming and the wall-e popping I like

696
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:16,639
to do it early in a commercial

697
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:18,710
environment things will get ahead of you

698
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,870
so if you don't start it right away it

699
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:22,340
gets really easy to fall behind very

700
00:24:20,869 --> 00:24:25,308
quickly and in a commercial environment

701
00:24:22,339 --> 00:24:25,639
that only compounds so on day one I move

702
00:24:25,308 --> 00:24:27,558
the

703
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:29,690
into the flower room I set up the

704
00:24:27,558 --> 00:24:31,099
trellis I give the plants a nice pop and

705
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:33,080
twist and work them into the trellis

706
00:24:31,099 --> 00:24:34,939
I'll do some defoliating I like to do a

707
00:24:33,079 --> 00:24:36,529
bunch of bottoming and Lolly popping and

708
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:38,840
then right before we leave for the night

709
00:24:36,529 --> 00:24:41,660
we give the plants a nice pesticide

710
00:24:38,839 --> 00:24:44,750
spray another important thing to think

711
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:46,910
about at this transitional time is bulbs

712
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:49,308
what kind of bulbs are you going to use

713
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:50,840
for flowering I usually recommend a

714
00:24:49,308 --> 00:24:52,428
metal halide for vegging and a

715
00:24:50,839 --> 00:24:55,009
high-pressure sodium for flowering

716
00:24:52,429 --> 00:24:57,259
lighting technology has advanced so far

717
00:24:55,009 --> 00:24:59,298
in recent years but you may be using

718
00:24:57,259 --> 00:25:01,700
LEDs you may be using ceramic metal

719
00:24:59,298 --> 00:25:04,039
halides there are tons of options but

720
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:06,710
consider changing your spectrum early in

721
00:25:04,039 --> 00:25:08,629
the flowering phase one useful trick I

722
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:10,579
have learned to help reduce their early

723
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:13,010
flower stretch is to leave the metal

724
00:25:10,579 --> 00:25:15,168
halide bulbs in for the first two weeks

725
00:25:13,009 --> 00:25:16,460
of flowering a lot of people will swap

726
00:25:15,169 --> 00:25:18,290
out the metal halides for the high

727
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:20,150
pressure sodium Zonday one of flowering

728
00:25:18,289 --> 00:25:22,220
I have learned that if you leave those

729
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:24,380
howards in there for two weeks your

730
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:26,600
plants will not stretch as ridiculously

731
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:28,010
when you initiate flower that is natural

732
00:25:26,599 --> 00:25:30,709
for plants to stretch they just want to

733
00:25:28,009 --> 00:25:33,169
take off but cracking them popping them

734
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:35,390
twisting them and keeping in that metal

735
00:25:33,169 --> 00:25:37,940
halide will drastically slow down that

736
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:39,799
stretch all right podcast rolled I feel

737
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:41,840
like we have a good solid foundation on

738
00:25:39,798 --> 00:25:44,329
transitioning our plants from veg to

739
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:46,609
flower at this point if you are growing

740
00:25:44,329 --> 00:25:48,678
from seeds you will need to keep a close

741
00:25:46,609 --> 00:25:49,879
eye on the plants and look out for males

742
00:25:48,679 --> 00:25:51,559
you will need to look out for

743
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:53,600
hermaphrodites and you will need to pay

744
00:25:51,558 --> 00:25:55,369
attention for mutants if you've got a

745
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:56,869
plant in there doing some weird [ __ ] you

746
00:25:55,369 --> 00:25:59,089
need to decide if you want to keep it or

747
00:25:56,869 --> 00:26:01,639
let it finish sometimes those mutant

748
00:25:59,089 --> 00:26:03,168
plants put off amazing products they are

749
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,850
also a pain in the ass to grow and they

750
00:26:03,169 --> 00:26:05,690
are problematic so sometimes it's not

751
00:26:04,849 --> 00:26:07,279
even worth it

752
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:09,769
so if you've got a mutant it is up to

753
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:11,418
you to decide what to do another thing

754
00:26:09,769 --> 00:26:13,429
we need to stay on top of is scouting

755
00:26:11,419 --> 00:26:15,080
for insects yes we did just apply some

756
00:26:13,429 --> 00:26:17,150
pesticides we may have released some

757
00:26:15,079 --> 00:26:19,428
predator bugs but that does not mean

758
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:22,730
that we are bulletproof always be

759
00:26:19,429 --> 00:26:24,679
scouting for pasts every day as you walk

760
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:25,970
through the grow just to go from one end

761
00:26:24,679 --> 00:26:27,620
to the other to go get the scissors you

762
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:29,480
forgot down there or to go find the

763
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:31,849
broom just glance at the plants as you

764
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:34,130
walk by that is when I make the most

765
00:26:31,849 --> 00:26:35,869
random discoveries I'm not even looking

766
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:37,100
for something I was just walking by and

767
00:26:35,869 --> 00:26:38,779
I said what the hell is that out of the

768
00:26:37,099 --> 00:26:39,269
corner of my eye now I know there's a

769
00:26:38,779 --> 00:26:40,950
problem

770
00:26:39,269 --> 00:26:42,660
now we can solve it always be paying

771
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:44,640
attention always be scouting for bugs

772
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:45,330
and problems in the grow keep your eyes

773
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,009
open

774
00:26:45,329 --> 00:26:48,629
we need to look for hermaphrodites we

775
00:26:47,009 --> 00:26:50,099
need to look for males we need to look

776
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:52,290
for mutants and we need to pay close

777
00:26:50,099 --> 00:26:54,178
attention for signs of pests

778
00:26:52,289 --> 00:26:55,589
all right podcast world I can feel the

779
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:57,450
cold medicine that I took starting to

780
00:26:55,589 --> 00:26:59,099
kick in my face is going numb my nose is

781
00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:00,808
starting to run kind of weird I need to

782
00:26:59,099 --> 00:27:02,849
wrap up this podcast before I get too

783
00:27:00,808 --> 00:27:04,200
lit to be on a microphone I want to

840
00:28:59,609 --> 00:29:04,709
I feel like that will make for a great

841
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:06,480
podcast this episode is going to be

842
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:08,130
another grow lesson if you've been

843
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:10,620
following along you know I've been doing

844
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:12,510
a long series of grow lessons we started

845
00:29:10,619 --> 00:29:14,189
by setting a goal for our garden we

846
00:29:12,509 --> 00:29:15,779
found a right place for our garden we

847
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:17,910
selected and purchased the appropriate

848
00:29:15,779 --> 00:29:20,279
equipment at this point in the grow we

849
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:22,769
are past week one a flower and we are

850
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:24,809
entering week two of the flowering phase

851
00:29:22,769 --> 00:29:26,910
this episode will highlight weeks two

852
00:29:24,809 --> 00:29:29,279
and three or days eight through twenty

853
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:30,779
one of the flowering phase if you feel

854
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:32,190
like you need a better foundation and

855
00:29:30,779 --> 00:29:34,710
you haven't been listening to the show I

856
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:36,690
recommend you head back to episode 351

857
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:39,509
and start on the grow lessons in episode

858
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:41,070
351 if you've been following along and

859
00:29:39,509 --> 00:29:43,559
you feel like you're up to speed let's

860
00:29:41,069 --> 00:29:45,119
jump right into a grow lesson in this

861
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:46,919
episode we're going to focus on weeks

862
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:49,919
two and three of the flowering phase

863
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:51,990
also known as days 8 through 21 before

864
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:54,630
we get there let's recap a little bit of

865
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:57,150
the previous episode in the last episode

866
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:59,790
we changed our timer to 12 hours on and

867
00:29:57,150 --> 00:30:02,360
12 hours off to initiate flower we are

868
00:29:59,789 --> 00:30:04,470
now seven days into the flowering phase

869
00:30:02,359 --> 00:30:06,539
hopefully at this point you have not

870
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:08,610
over fertilized or ran into any pH

871
00:30:06,539 --> 00:30:10,289
issues with your garden hopefully at

872
00:30:08,609 --> 00:30:12,750
this point you have not interrupted the

873
00:30:10,289 --> 00:30:14,670
dark cycle at all interrupting that dark

874
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:16,680
cycle will disrupt the flowering phase

875
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:19,830
and throw your plants into shock and

876
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:21,600
possibly cause hermaphrodites hopefully

877
00:30:19,829 --> 00:30:23,939
the garden has remained pests and

878
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:24,859
pathogens free so if everything is on

879
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:28,279
the right track

880
00:30:24,859 --> 00:30:30,919
let's move in to week 2 or day 8 of the

881
00:30:28,279 --> 00:30:32,450
flowering phase at this stage of the

882
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:34,548
flowering process we're not going to

883
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:36,289
notice much change from the vegetative

884
00:30:34,548 --> 00:30:37,910
cycle you may notice a little bit of

885
00:30:36,289 --> 00:30:38,960
stretch the plants may have taken off

886
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:41,420
they're starting to get a little bit

887
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:43,610
taller on you some of your plants may be

888
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:45,500
showing pre flower some of your plants

889
00:30:43,609 --> 00:30:47,509
may start indicating sex around this

890
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:49,490
time don't stress if they are not

891
00:30:47,509 --> 00:30:51,710
showing you sex yet we still have plenty

892
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:53,599
of time but the main thing you're going

893
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:55,850
to see at this point is stretch those

894
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:57,589
plants are starting to grow taller that

895
00:30:55,849 --> 00:30:59,509
is okay that's exactly what we're

896
00:30:57,589 --> 00:31:01,279
expecting for the first three weeks we

897
00:30:59,509 --> 00:31:03,710
are going to see a lot of stretching

898
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:05,960
happening to these plants now we will

899
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:08,029
probably start seeing pre flower and bud

900
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:10,308
sets starting to develop around day ten

901
00:31:08,029 --> 00:31:12,349
or twelve we will definitely have little

902
00:31:10,308 --> 00:31:14,720
dandelion looking bud sets popping up

903
00:31:12,349 --> 00:31:16,490
around day 14 so things are about to

904
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:18,589
start getting very exciting in our

905
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:20,450
garden now let's talk about the

906
00:31:18,589 --> 00:31:22,519
environment and conditions in our grow

907
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:25,069
room during weeks two and three of the

908
00:31:22,519 --> 00:31:27,619
flowering phase at this stage of

909
00:31:25,069 --> 00:31:30,259
flowering during the day I try to aim

910
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:32,659
between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit for

911
00:31:30,259 --> 00:31:34,490
my daytime temperature I also aim for

912
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:37,519
forty to fifty percent relative humidity

913
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:40,009
for my daytime temperature now let's

914
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:41,808
talk about nighttime temperatures in the

915
00:31:40,009 --> 00:31:44,390
night time I like to have my temperature

916
00:31:41,808 --> 00:31:47,629
between 60 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit

917
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:49,880
I also aim for 40 to 50% humidity during

918
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:52,490
my nighttime cycle at this stage of

919
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:54,380
flowering now I want to remind you try

920
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:56,599
not to have more than a 10 degree

921
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:58,669
temperature difference in your day and

922
00:31:56,599 --> 00:32:01,279
nighttime cycle that is called your

923
00:31:58,669 --> 00:32:04,280
diurnal temperature variation try to

924
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:05,779
keep that less than 10 degrees too much

925
00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:07,668
of a drastic swing from day to night

926
00:32:05,779 --> 00:32:09,289
temperature will start causing your

927
00:32:07,669 --> 00:32:11,299
plants to grow slowly they will get

928
00:32:09,289 --> 00:32:13,399
stagnant they will slow down it will not

929
00:32:11,298 --> 00:32:16,220
be happy also this will encourage

930
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:18,140
powdery mildew so let's aim to keep that

931
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:20,900
temperature within 10 degrees from the

932
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:22,429
day and night cycles something we should

933
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:24,860
add into our flower room that I've been

934
00:32:22,429 --> 00:32:27,230
overlooking on previous episodes is more

935
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:29,000
fans we need more airflow as we are

936
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:31,400
entering the flowering stage we are

937
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,890
going to develop big fat chunky buds

938
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:35,990
we need more airflow once we have those

939
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:37,790
buds in the room we're going to have a

940
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:38,480
lot of moisture we're gonna have big fat

941
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:40,639
chunky

942
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:42,470
those buds will act like a sponge if

943
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:44,150
there is too much moisture so we need to

944
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:46,220
blow some air around the room and keep

945
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:47,990
that moisture moving I feel like a

946
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:49,640
little bit of wind and airflow is really

947
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:51,349
good for the plants it makes them active

948
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:53,150
I feel like some wind and a little bit

949
00:32:51,349 --> 00:32:54,919
of pressure makes the stalks more robust

950
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:57,230
it makes them want to stand up on their

951
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:58,580
own a little better imagine if I shove

952
00:32:57,230 --> 00:33:00,289
you a little bit you would spread your

953
00:32:58,579 --> 00:33:01,669
feet for a little more balance I think a

954
00:33:00,289 --> 00:33:02,960
little bit of wind it makes the plants

955
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:05,150
want to spread their feet for a little

956
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:07,370
bit more balance so add a little bit of

957
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:09,170
wind and airflow to the garden don't go

958
00:33:07,369 --> 00:33:10,250
crazy we don't need a wind tunnel and

959
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:12,860
there we're not trying to dry out the

960
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:14,720
plants we just want the air moving if

961
00:33:12,859 --> 00:33:16,669
some of your leaves start looking dry

962
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:18,470
and leathery and kind of potato-chip

963
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:20,480
like they're probably getting beat up by

964
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:22,910
that fan too much you were ruining the

965
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:24,799
VPD around those leaves in that

966
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:26,870
condition just reduce the wind just a

967
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:29,359
little bit but it's never a bad idea to

968
00:33:26,869 --> 00:33:30,949
have some airflow in your grow if you

969
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:33,109
notice your grow room is consistently

970
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:35,299
too humid it may be time to invest in a

971
00:33:33,109 --> 00:33:37,759
dehumidifier or maybe a larger

972
00:33:35,299 --> 00:33:40,369
dehumidifier or possibly add some sort

973
00:33:37,759 --> 00:33:42,200
of extraction fan to remove that humid

974
00:33:40,369 --> 00:33:43,849
air from the room and replace it with

975
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:46,130
fresh air if you do add an extraction

976
00:33:43,849 --> 00:33:47,809
fan keep in mind that as the air gets

977
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:49,790
sucked out of the room it is also going

978
00:33:47,809 --> 00:33:51,859
to try to draw air into the room through

979
00:33:49,789 --> 00:33:53,240
every open opportunity most of the time

980
00:33:51,859 --> 00:33:54,829
you're going to get air pulled into the

981
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:56,779
room underneath the door most of us

982
00:33:54,829 --> 00:33:58,789
don't seal the bottom of the door well

983
00:33:56,779 --> 00:34:01,039
enough I feel like that is a great place

984
00:33:58,789 --> 00:34:03,529
for fresh air to come in as long as the

985
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:05,299
air coming in is clean if that air is

986
00:34:03,529 --> 00:34:07,399
coming from within your house it is

987
00:34:05,299 --> 00:34:09,529
probably safe if that crack leads to

988
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:11,450
outside I would cover that up and find a

989
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:13,280
safer source for the air that's just

990
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:14,960
going to bring in bugs it's going to

991
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:17,120
bring in whatever is by that door if

992
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:19,130
it's powdery mildew if it's just dirt

993
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:20,710
and dust it's going to suck all of that

994
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:23,148
right under the door into your grow room

995
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:24,860
so as soon as you cut a hole for an

996
00:34:23,148 --> 00:34:26,690
extraction fan start thinking about

997
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:28,849
where the air is going to come in when

998
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:30,380
you start blowing that air out if you

999
00:34:28,849 --> 00:34:32,449
cut a hole in a wall and add an

1000
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:35,200
extraction fan and blow that air out of

1001
00:34:32,449 --> 00:34:37,639
the room it may create a whistling noise

1002
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:40,189
underneath the door from all the air

1003
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:42,168
flowing underneath that door if it

1004
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:44,960
creates a big whistling noise you may

1005
00:34:42,168 --> 00:34:47,389
need to add a passive hole for air to go

1006
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:49,309
into the room this just depends on the

1007
00:34:47,389 --> 00:34:51,500
size of the extraction fan that you set

1008
00:34:49,309 --> 00:34:52,279
up if you put a little 4-inch extraction

1009
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,599
fan you

1010
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:55,130
definitely pull enough air under the

1011
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:57,110
door you don't need to make any passive

1012
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:59,240
holes if you go setting up an 8-inch

1013
00:34:57,110 --> 00:35:00,890
vortex fan in there and you just blow an

1014
00:34:59,239 --> 00:35:02,239
air out of that room first of all I

1015
00:35:00,889 --> 00:35:04,460
recommend a carbon filter on that

1016
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:06,559
extraction fan that's going out you need

1017
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:09,170
to filter that air but also you may need

1018
00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:11,059
to make about a 4-inch hole to allow air

1019
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:13,070
to get into that room somehow you are

1020
00:35:11,059 --> 00:35:15,949
sucking all of the air out you need to

1021
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:17,750
allow fresh air in cutting holes in

1022
00:35:15,949 --> 00:35:19,759
walls and adding extraction fans can

1023
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:21,980
lead to a lot of problems think about

1024
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:24,860
this very carefully before you go this

1025
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:26,360
route also if you're using co2 you may

1026
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:27,740
want to think about this option because

1027
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:29,269
then you're going to fill the room with

1028
00:35:27,739 --> 00:35:31,069
co2 and then you're just gonna use that

1029
00:35:29,269 --> 00:35:32,389
exhaust fan to suck the co2 right out of

1030
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:34,400
the room you're kind of blowing your

1031
00:35:32,389 --> 00:35:36,529
expensive gas right out the window

1032
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,510
literally I've kind of opened up the

1033
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:40,580
conversation for negative pressure

1034
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:42,260
versus positive pressure in a grow room

1035
00:35:40,579 --> 00:35:44,659
environment but I feel like that is a

1036
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:46,400
lesson for the future I will write a

1037
00:35:44,659 --> 00:35:48,349
note and we will talk about that in a

1038
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,389
future episode let's get a little bit

1039
00:35:48,349 --> 00:35:52,369
more on track with this grow lesson and

1040
00:35:50,389 --> 00:35:54,739
focus let's talk a little bit about the

1041
00:35:52,369 --> 00:35:57,529
nutrients we may need at this phase of

1042
00:35:54,739 --> 00:35:59,329
the flowering cycle during this part of

1043
00:35:57,530 --> 00:36:01,580
flowering we are mainly focusing on a

1044
00:35:59,329 --> 00:36:04,069
smooth transition from the vegetative

1045
00:36:01,579 --> 00:36:05,389
stage to the flowering phase at this

1046
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:08,059
point in flowering we are mainly

1047
00:36:05,389 --> 00:36:10,489
focusing on a smooth transition from the

1048
00:36:08,059 --> 00:36:13,519
veg stage to the flowering stage of our

1049
00:36:10,489 --> 00:36:17,299
plant cycle week 2 is very similar to

1050
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:20,030
week 1 we will mainly focus on our NPK

1051
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:23,000
we need a low nitrogen high phosphorous

1052
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:25,340
high potassium diet at this stage I said

1053
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:28,550
earlier abandon the veg bottle and start

1054
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:30,590
using the bloom bottle also we need

1055
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:33,500
cal-mag at this stage we also need

1056
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:35,960
potassium silicates in my opinion I also

1057
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:37,969
like to add a Maiko product some sort of

1058
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:41,690
root product is always good at this

1059
00:36:37,969 --> 00:36:45,109
stage also enzymes and carbs are great

1060
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:48,019
for week 2 as we work toward week 3 I

1061
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:50,090
like to increase my carbohydrates the

1062
00:36:48,019 --> 00:36:52,159
plants are getting bud set at this point

1063
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:54,110
they're going to start taking off I like

1064
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:55,789
having some sugars in there to feed the

1065
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:57,289
microbes and then I like having the

1066
00:36:55,789 --> 00:36:59,329
carbs and the sugars in there to give

1067
00:36:57,289 --> 00:37:01,849
the plants energy that will encourage

1068
00:36:59,329 --> 00:37:03,619
rapid growth so at the beginning of week

1069
00:37:01,849 --> 00:37:05,838
3 I will start increasing my

1070
00:37:03,619 --> 00:37:07,788
carbohydrate feeding just a little

1071
00:37:05,838 --> 00:37:10,429
bit and it will slowly increase that

1072
00:37:07,789 --> 00:37:12,229
through the flowering phase now we don't

1073
00:37:10,429 --> 00:37:13,399
need to add a bloom booster yet we are

1074
00:37:12,228 --> 00:37:15,228
not quite there yet

1075
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:17,599
so let's just focus on getting these

1076
00:37:15,228 --> 00:37:19,429
plants through the stretch phase and get

1077
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:21,318
the bud sites developed and then when we

1078
00:37:19,429 --> 00:37:24,768
work on the next lesson we will start

1079
00:37:21,318 --> 00:37:26,748
adding bloom boosters now we are rapidly

1080
00:37:24,768 --> 00:37:29,058
running out of time for pesticide

1081
00:37:26,748 --> 00:37:31,968
applications we need to do a very

1082
00:37:29,059 --> 00:37:33,439
thorough pest scouting and see what

1083
00:37:31,969 --> 00:37:35,389
we've got in the grove we may have

1084
00:37:33,438 --> 00:37:36,920
thrips we may have spider mites we could

1085
00:37:35,389 --> 00:37:38,659
have fungus gnats we could have white

1086
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:40,699
flies there could be a myriad of

1087
00:37:38,659 --> 00:37:43,578
problems popping up at this point in the

1088
00:37:40,699 --> 00:37:45,619
grow let's do an inspection and find out

1089
00:37:43,579 --> 00:37:48,619
what we're dealing with if you find any

1090
00:37:45,619 --> 00:37:51,528
pests now is one of your last times to

1091
00:37:48,619 --> 00:37:54,680
apply a sprayed pesticide I don't like

1092
00:37:51,528 --> 00:37:56,719
to spray anything after day 14 if you've

1093
00:37:54,679 --> 00:37:58,578
got an obvious problem we may extend

1094
00:37:56,719 --> 00:38:00,739
that just a few days with very specific

1095
00:37:58,579 --> 00:38:04,430
products but I really don't like to

1096
00:38:00,739 --> 00:38:06,499
spray anything past day 14 so let's do a

1097
00:38:04,429 --> 00:38:08,538
quick scouting let's identify any

1098
00:38:06,498 --> 00:38:11,328
problems we may have and let's spray

1099
00:38:08,539 --> 00:38:13,189
before day 14 approaches at this point

1100
00:38:11,329 --> 00:38:16,670
we're at day 8 so we can get two or

1101
00:38:13,188 --> 00:38:19,308
three solid pesticide spray applications

1102
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:22,219
in if they are required if you don't

1103
00:38:19,309 --> 00:38:25,309
identify any pests I may still suggest a

1104
00:38:22,219 --> 00:38:27,858
preventative spray around day 14 just to

1105
00:38:25,309 --> 00:38:30,469
make sure nothing pops up now is the

1106
00:38:27,858 --> 00:38:32,478
time to get in there and identify pests

1107
00:38:30,469 --> 00:38:34,489
and work really hard at getting rid of

1108
00:38:32,478 --> 00:38:36,739
them before we move deeper into the

1109
00:38:34,489 --> 00:38:40,009
flowering phase and we really limit

1110
00:38:36,739 --> 00:38:41,838
ourselves on pesticide applications this

1111
00:38:40,009 --> 00:38:43,849
is also a good time to start ordering

1112
00:38:41,838 --> 00:38:46,188
your predator bugs if you are going to

1113
00:38:43,849 --> 00:38:47,739
use biologicals as your pesticide

1114
00:38:46,188 --> 00:38:50,088
treatment if you plan on using

1115
00:38:47,739 --> 00:38:52,699
biologicals think about your spray

1116
00:38:50,088 --> 00:38:55,068
applications and use a strategy that

1117
00:38:52,699 --> 00:38:57,108
will not cause harm to your beneficials

1118
00:38:55,068 --> 00:38:59,538
when they do arrive there are pesticides

1119
00:38:57,108 --> 00:39:02,298
that you can apply to your plants today

1120
00:38:59,539 --> 00:39:04,459
and you can release beneficial insects

1121
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:06,650
tomorrow and they will work together if

1122
00:39:04,458 --> 00:39:08,538
you apply the proper pesticide you will

1123
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:10,400
not kill your beneficials you will have

1124
00:39:08,539 --> 00:39:12,439
to do some research on the pesticide and

1125
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:14,719
the beneficials and see if they get

1126
00:39:12,438 --> 00:39:16,788
along some of the pesticides are based

1127
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:19,429
on pyrethrum some of them are based on

1128
00:39:16,789 --> 00:39:22,130
neem some of them are beneficial

1129
00:39:19,429 --> 00:39:24,889
and bacteria those beneficial fungus and

1130
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:26,660
bacteria may not kill or disrupt your

1131
00:39:24,889 --> 00:39:28,818
predator bugs but it will make the

1132
00:39:26,659 --> 00:39:30,828
environment uncomfortable for the spider

1133
00:39:28,818 --> 00:39:33,019
mites because they intend to eat those

1134
00:39:30,829 --> 00:39:35,359
leaves the Predators are going to eat

1135
00:39:33,019 --> 00:39:37,369
the spider mites not the leaves so they

1136
00:39:35,358 --> 00:39:39,769
may be able to survive with certain

1137
00:39:37,369 --> 00:39:41,690
pesticides it's your responsibility as

1138
00:39:39,769 --> 00:39:43,880
the grower to do the research on the

1139
00:39:41,690 --> 00:39:46,429
pesticide you're going to apply and also

1140
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:48,410
do research on the predator bugs which

1141
00:39:46,429 --> 00:39:51,139
you plan to use in your integrated pest

1142
00:39:48,409 --> 00:39:53,538
management strategy and find out if they

1143
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:55,788
can work together some of the newer

1144
00:39:53,539 --> 00:39:58,730
pesticide and fungicide products

1145
00:39:55,789 --> 00:40:01,309
actually advertise safe for beneficials

1146
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:03,139
or well not harm beneficials that is

1147
00:40:01,309 --> 00:40:04,970
saying that they recommend that product

1148
00:40:03,139 --> 00:40:07,400
in a garden that is also using

1149
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:09,558
beneficial insects as a form of pest

1150
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:11,329
management so let's get on top of pest

1151
00:40:09,559 --> 00:40:13,400
management let's do some scouting and if

1152
00:40:11,329 --> 00:40:14,900
you see anything now is the time to work

1153
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:16,730
on getting rid of that before we get

1154
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:18,588
deeper into flower now while you're

1155
00:40:16,730 --> 00:40:20,778
scouting for pests that is a great time

1156
00:40:18,588 --> 00:40:22,788
to keep an eye out for male plants if

1157
00:40:20,778 --> 00:40:25,190
you are growing from seed you've got the

1158
00:40:22,789 --> 00:40:26,990
opportunity to find males in your garden

1159
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:28,849
you have also got the opportunity to

1160
00:40:26,989 --> 00:40:31,338
find hermaphrodites in the garden and

1161
00:40:28,849 --> 00:40:33,890
you may also find some mutants in your

1162
00:40:31,338 --> 00:40:36,230
flowering room the male plants are going

1163
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:37,940
to start popping up around day ten they

1164
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:40,730
usually open up and start dropping

1165
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:42,740
pollen right around day 14 so we've got

1166
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:44,510
a very small window of time to discover

1167
00:40:42,739 --> 00:40:47,750
these males and get them out of the room

1168
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:49,670
before they cause problems don't be lazy

1169
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:51,318
when it comes to pooling males out of

1170
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:53,119
your garden if you've got a small garden

1171
00:40:51,318 --> 00:40:55,009
if you've got a large garden you need to

1172
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:57,858
look at every single plant and pull

1173
00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:59,240
every single male out of that grow you

1174
00:40:57,858 --> 00:41:01,969
also need to pay very close attention

1175
00:40:59,239 --> 00:41:03,679
for hermaphrodites when you're checking

1176
00:41:01,969 --> 00:41:06,469
for males and hermaphrodites on new

1177
00:41:03,679 --> 00:41:08,449
plants check in several spots on each

1178
00:41:06,469 --> 00:41:10,788
plant the top may not reveal

1179
00:41:08,449 --> 00:41:12,469
hermaphrodite traits down lower we're

1180
00:41:10,789 --> 00:41:15,859
not getting a lot of light penetration

1181
00:41:12,469 --> 00:41:17,778
those plants may show intersex traits

1182
00:41:15,858 --> 00:41:20,480
you may get male flowers popping up in

1183
00:41:17,778 --> 00:41:22,730
your female buds lower on the plant pay

1184
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:24,318
close attention to the entire plant I

1185
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:26,240
feel like I gave a pretty good

1186
00:41:24,318 --> 00:41:28,038
description of what a male plant looks

1187
00:41:26,239 --> 00:41:30,618
like and what a female plant looks like

1188
00:41:28,039 --> 00:41:32,400
on a previous podcast but I do encourage

1189
00:41:30,619 --> 00:41:34,680
you to google male

1190
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:36,599
and female cannabis plants and see what

1191
00:41:34,679 --> 00:41:38,489
they look like before the time comes

1192
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:40,499
that way when you've got a boy in the

1193
00:41:38,489 --> 00:41:42,298
garden you are sure and you've got

1194
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:44,848
confidence and you can remove that male

1195
00:41:42,298 --> 00:41:46,259
plant from your garden confidently and

1196
00:41:44,849 --> 00:41:48,269
know you are not going to cause any

1197
00:41:46,259 --> 00:41:50,730
problems you want to find the boys

1198
00:41:48,268 --> 00:41:52,409
before the pollen sacks start opening

1199
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:54,298
let's talk about what happens if you

1200
00:41:52,409 --> 00:41:56,429
find a boy and one of those sacks is

1201
00:41:54,298 --> 00:41:58,380
starting to open the first thing I would

1202
00:41:56,429 --> 00:42:00,838
do is spray it with water water

1203
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:03,150
deactivates pollen spray that pollen

1204
00:42:00,838 --> 00:42:05,429
with water you'll shut it down also

1205
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:07,889
spray the girls with water if you've got

1206
00:42:05,429 --> 00:42:09,328
clean water around just spray some water

1207
00:42:07,889 --> 00:42:10,739
on the plants yes I said we don't want

1208
00:42:09,329 --> 00:42:12,450
to spray plants that are in flower

1209
00:42:10,739 --> 00:42:14,189
I'd rather get them a little bit wet at

1210
00:42:12,449 --> 00:42:16,139
this point then I would rather get

1211
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:17,999
pollen on them also this is just water

1212
00:42:16,139 --> 00:42:19,710
there's no pesticide in here the plants

1213
00:42:17,998 --> 00:42:21,538
would get hit with rain it would get hit

1214
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:23,220
with Dew this is going to be just fine

1215
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:25,470
spray them with some water that will

1216
00:42:23,219 --> 00:42:27,298
deactivate the pollen it will also make

1217
00:42:25,469 --> 00:42:29,278
the plants unable to receive the pollen

1218
00:42:27,298 --> 00:42:31,318
at that point you can either cut down

1219
00:42:29,278 --> 00:42:33,449
that male plant or you can slide up

1220
00:42:31,318 --> 00:42:35,460
trash bag right over it like a condom

1221
00:42:33,449 --> 00:42:38,278
then cut it then get it out of the room

1222
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:39,960
is try not to spread that pollen I know

1223
00:42:38,278 --> 00:42:41,548
we've sprayed it with water but as you

1224
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:43,559
bump it around it's gonna open up more

1225
00:42:41,548 --> 00:42:46,048
pollens gonna come out do your best not

1226
00:42:43,559 --> 00:42:47,849
to spread that stuff it was water put

1227
00:42:46,048 --> 00:42:49,889
the trash bag over it either take the

1228
00:42:47,849 --> 00:42:52,289
whole plant including the dirt out of

1229
00:42:49,889 --> 00:42:54,420
the grow or cut it at the base and just

1230
00:42:52,289 --> 00:42:55,470
get that plant out of there as soon as

1231
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:57,150
possible

1232
00:42:55,469 --> 00:42:59,608
leaving a male plant in the grow room

1233
00:42:57,150 --> 00:43:01,499
for too long will result in a seeded

1234
00:42:59,608 --> 00:43:03,659
crop most of us are aiming for a

1235
00:43:01,498 --> 00:43:05,278
seedless crop if you were growing a crop

1236
00:43:03,659 --> 00:43:06,568
for a commercial reason and you're

1237
00:43:05,278 --> 00:43:09,630
trying to put it out on the black market

1238
00:43:06,568 --> 00:43:12,509
a couple of seeds will ruin the value of

1239
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:14,220
your entire crop so don't be lazy keep

1240
00:43:12,509 --> 00:43:15,838
your eye out for males know what males

1241
00:43:14,219 --> 00:43:18,328
look like and get them out of the garden

1242
00:43:15,838 --> 00:43:20,670
also keep an eye out for hermaphrodites

1243
00:43:18,329 --> 00:43:22,769
and get them out of the garden once we

1244
00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:24,210
are past weeks two and three you cannot

1245
00:43:22,768 --> 00:43:26,338
get lazy if you're growing from seed

1246
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:28,289
just because they look like females

1247
00:43:26,338 --> 00:43:30,509
you've still got the opportunity for a

1248
00:43:28,289 --> 00:43:32,640
hermaphrodite to pop up all the way

1249
00:43:30,509 --> 00:43:35,039
through the flowering cycle it may not

1250
00:43:32,639 --> 00:43:37,379
show itself until week nine it may not

1251
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:39,930
show itself until week ten but you need

1252
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:41,789
to see it if it does happen I've said

1253
00:43:39,929 --> 00:43:43,919
earlier if it pops up late in flower it

1254
00:43:41,789 --> 00:43:45,900
may not be a big deal it is too late for

1255
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:48,059
the plants to receive pollen they won't

1256
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:49,769
any seeds that lead into flower and most

1257
00:43:48,059 --> 00:43:51,750
of the time if they throw a male flower

1258
00:43:49,769 --> 00:43:54,269
past week seven or eight

1259
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:56,010
they're usually sterile male flowers

1260
00:43:54,269 --> 00:43:58,079
that will not contain any pollen so

1261
00:43:56,010 --> 00:44:00,030
there's not much to worry about but if

1262
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:02,909
you're getting hermaphrodites early in

1263
00:44:00,030 --> 00:44:04,500
flower they must be removed from the

1264
00:44:02,909 --> 00:44:06,299
garden all right we've got our

1265
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:08,219
environment dialed in we know what to

1266
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:09,870
feed our plants we are scouting for

1267
00:44:08,219 --> 00:44:12,209
pests we have applied our final

1268
00:44:09,869 --> 00:44:14,489
pesticide application we have considered

1269
00:44:12,210 --> 00:44:16,500
releasing predator mites we know how to

1270
00:44:14,489 --> 00:44:18,389
look for males and hermaphrodites we are

1271
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:20,070
on the look for trouble we're looking

1272
00:44:18,389 --> 00:44:22,829
for bugs we're looking for males we're

1273
00:44:20,070 --> 00:44:24,960
looking for Herms now let's talk about a

1274
00:44:22,829 --> 00:44:27,090
few things we can do to improve the

1275
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:29,429
quality of our garden this early in the

1276
00:44:27,090 --> 00:44:31,710
flowering phase if you're running a

1277
00:44:29,429 --> 00:44:34,319
trellis or a sprog net now is a good

1278
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:35,760
time to continue working those buds into

1279
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:38,070
the net you can still work those

1280
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:40,140
branches into the net I would stop doing

1281
00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:42,000
it probably toward the end of week three

1282
00:44:40,139 --> 00:44:43,889
but you've still got time if you've got

1283
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,690
a branch that's popping up too high feel

1284
00:44:43,889 --> 00:44:47,190
free to give it a little crack bend it

1285
00:44:45,690 --> 00:44:49,380
down under the net and work it into the

1286
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:51,150
canopy we can keep working on a nice

1287
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:53,430
even canopy all the way through the end

1288
00:44:51,150 --> 00:44:54,990
of week three so let's keep popping them

1289
00:44:53,429 --> 00:44:56,969
let's keep twisting them and working

1290
00:44:54,989 --> 00:44:59,339
them into the canopy let's talk a little

1291
00:44:56,969 --> 00:45:00,959
bit about popping and twisting I've

1292
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:02,940
talked a lot about popping and twisting

1293
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:05,039
in the beginning of flower I continue to

1294
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:07,950
do this all the way through weeks four

1295
00:45:05,039 --> 00:45:09,480
and five I will pop every stem right at

1296
00:45:07,949 --> 00:45:11,489
the beginning of flower give it about

1297
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:13,469
two weeks to heal up and go back and do

1298
00:45:11,489 --> 00:45:16,409
it again give it about two weeks to heal

1299
00:45:13,469 --> 00:45:18,269
up and go back and do it again so grab

1300
00:45:16,409 --> 00:45:20,399
the base of the stock grab it with your

1301
00:45:18,269 --> 00:45:22,170
other hand and twist your top hand and

1302
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:24,240
as you twist you'll hear a little pop

1303
00:45:22,170 --> 00:45:26,550
that's exactly what you're looking for

1304
00:45:24,239 --> 00:45:28,679
as that heals it will create a knuckle

1305
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:30,660
that knuckle will make a strong spot in

1306
00:45:28,679 --> 00:45:32,879
the plant I like to do that tour the

1307
00:45:30,659 --> 00:45:34,679
entire plant is covered in knuckles it

1308
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:36,660
looks really knurled and I feel like

1309
00:45:34,679 --> 00:45:38,759
that that plant is very productive it's

1310
00:45:36,659 --> 00:45:40,889
got a nice thick stalk that can hold a

1311
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:42,720
lot of weight it can hold fat buds it's

1312
00:45:40,889 --> 00:45:44,699
also got nice thick stalks that can move

1313
00:45:42,719 --> 00:45:46,619
a lot of water which can carry a lot of

1314
00:45:44,699 --> 00:45:49,500
nutrients so I feel like it is a very

1315
00:45:46,619 --> 00:45:52,079
beneficial thing to crack all of the

1316
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:53,400
stems so continue working your plants

1317
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:55,380
into the trellis if you're using a

1318
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:58,289
trellis continue cracking and popping

1319
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:59,829
the sticks to make robust plants I also

1320
00:45:58,289 --> 00:46:01,420
like to do a bit of lolly

1321
00:45:59,829 --> 00:46:03,069
popping if you've got some crappy

1322
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:05,349
branches on the bottom of the plant

1323
00:46:03,070 --> 00:46:07,360
feel free to remove them if you've got

1324
00:46:05,349 --> 00:46:08,949
branches that come off the very bottom

1325
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:11,349
of the plant and reach up for the top

1326
00:46:08,949 --> 00:46:14,230
and those top branches the tops have

1327
00:46:11,349 --> 00:46:16,389
potential to create good usable buds you

1328
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:18,789
can clean up the bottom suckers off of

1329
00:46:16,389 --> 00:46:20,529
that long branch and keep that arm and

1330
00:46:18,789 --> 00:46:22,239
grow but at the end of the arm and take

1331
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:24,190
off all that little crap at the bottom

1332
00:46:22,239 --> 00:46:26,679
of it that you don't need it is very

1333
00:46:24,190 --> 00:46:29,050
common to see plants that are three and

1334
00:46:26,679 --> 00:46:30,940
four feet tall that are completely naked

1335
00:46:29,050 --> 00:46:32,350
for the first 18 inches of the very

1336
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:34,119
bottom it's just a bunch of sticks

1337
00:46:32,349 --> 00:46:35,469
coming out of the pot you don't have any

1338
00:46:34,119 --> 00:46:36,940
foliage you don't have any little

1339
00:46:35,469 --> 00:46:39,789
branches you don't have any tiny bud

1340
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:41,530
sites for 18 inches to maybe even two

1341
00:46:39,789 --> 00:46:43,090
feet off the ground depending on the

1342
00:46:41,530 --> 00:46:45,010
growers environment and the growers

1343
00:46:43,090 --> 00:46:47,050
style and what type of lights they are

1344
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:48,820
using so feel free to get in there and

1345
00:46:47,050 --> 00:46:50,650
cut out any shitty branches that aren't

1346
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:52,809
going to be productive and feel free to

1347
00:46:50,650 --> 00:46:54,400
clean up all that stuff real down low on

1348
00:46:52,809 --> 00:46:57,159
the plant that's not going to get any

1349
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:58,990
light when harvest time comes we're

1350
00:46:57,159 --> 00:47:01,299
going to have to trim everything we cut

1351
00:46:58,989 --> 00:47:03,189
down if you cut all that little fluffy

1352
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:04,750
crap off the plant you don't have to

1353
00:47:03,190 --> 00:47:05,950
trim it now you're saying yeah I could

1354
00:47:04,750 --> 00:47:07,630
have used that for concentrates or

1355
00:47:05,949 --> 00:47:09,669
something right if you cut it all off

1356
00:47:07,630 --> 00:47:11,470
the bottom we can move that energy right

1357
00:47:09,670 --> 00:47:14,110
up to the top of the plant instead of

1358
00:47:11,469 --> 00:47:16,000
growing that crappy little fluff at the

1359
00:47:14,110 --> 00:47:18,010
bottom we just basically moved that up

1360
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,320
to that top Cola to make all those top

1361
00:47:18,010 --> 00:47:23,290
buds just that much heavier that much

1362
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:24,850
fatter that much more density so clean

1363
00:47:23,289 --> 00:47:26,739
up any crap on the bottom that may be

1364
00:47:24,849 --> 00:47:29,139
slowing your plants down and move that

1365
00:47:26,739 --> 00:47:32,189
energy right up to the top now another

1366
00:47:29,139 --> 00:47:34,690
thing I find advantageous is defoliation

1367
00:47:32,190 --> 00:47:37,000
there's a lot of debate in the cannabis

1368
00:47:34,690 --> 00:47:38,889
industry about how to do foliate what

1369
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:41,349
level to do foliate and when to

1370
00:47:38,889 --> 00:47:43,269
defoliate I like to do kind of a hard

1371
00:47:41,349 --> 00:47:46,210
defoliation right at the start of flower

1372
00:47:43,269 --> 00:47:48,070
if there is a large leaf shadowing

1373
00:47:46,210 --> 00:47:50,139
another branch or shadowing another bud

1374
00:47:48,070 --> 00:47:52,090
site I will remove that leaf without

1375
00:47:50,139 --> 00:47:54,309
question then I'll go through the grow

1376
00:47:52,090 --> 00:47:57,010
and anything with a purple pee daeul

1377
00:47:54,309 --> 00:47:59,199
gets removed at the very start of flower

1378
00:47:57,010 --> 00:48:02,080
I do this in a commercial environment

1379
00:47:59,199 --> 00:48:04,629
for several reasons removing all of

1380
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:06,670
those extra leaves removes opportunity

1381
00:48:04,630 --> 00:48:08,800
there are less places for pests to hide

1382
00:48:06,670 --> 00:48:11,349
and there are less places for pathogens

1383
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:13,000
to hang out so remove the opportunities

1384
00:48:11,349 --> 00:48:15,400
also a root

1385
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:17,949
uses humidity in the room without as

1386
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:19,750
many leaves doing as much transpiration

1387
00:48:17,949 --> 00:48:21,789
and respiration there's a little bit

1388
00:48:19,750 --> 00:48:23,769
less moisture in the room so it makes it

1389
00:48:21,789 --> 00:48:26,259
easier to balance the humidity in the

1390
00:48:23,769 --> 00:48:29,050
room I also think a well-timed

1391
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:31,960
well-executed defoliation will increase

1392
00:48:29,050 --> 00:48:33,370
the vigor of our plants now a lot of

1393
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:34,840
people will say you don't want to pull

1394
00:48:33,369 --> 00:48:36,339
off the leaves because that's where the

1395
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:39,220
sugars are stored and they're going to

1396
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:41,019
use that for nutrients and energy but we

1397
00:48:39,219 --> 00:48:42,759
are feeding the [ __ ] out of these plants

1398
00:48:41,019 --> 00:48:44,440
they don't need to use anything that is

1399
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:46,330
stored we are pouring expensive

1400
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:49,300
nutrients into these plants on a daily

1401
00:48:46,329 --> 00:48:51,519
basis don't worry about the stuff stored

1402
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:54,010
in those leaves we're gonna replace that

1403
00:48:51,519 --> 00:48:55,869
right away another argument to the

1404
00:48:54,010 --> 00:48:58,060
defoliation is that those leaves are

1405
00:48:55,869 --> 00:49:00,339
used as solar panels and they need to be

1406
00:48:58,059 --> 00:49:02,679
there yes they do but there is a point

1407
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:04,750
where sometimes a leaf is blocking a bud

1408
00:49:02,679 --> 00:49:06,279
site where if you remove that leaf it

1409
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:08,559
would be more beneficial to put the

1410
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:11,110
light closer to the bud then on that big

1411
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:13,960
ol solar leaf so selectively remove your

1412
00:49:11,110 --> 00:49:15,910
leaves if you're new at defoliating go

1413
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:18,130
in and just tear off a few leaves and

1414
00:49:15,909 --> 00:49:20,289
see how the plants react then the next

1415
00:49:18,130 --> 00:49:23,050
time take off a few more and see how the

1416
00:49:20,289 --> 00:49:26,320
plants react this will be very strain

1417
00:49:23,050 --> 00:49:28,750
dependent sativa leaning strains won't

1418
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:32,260
react as well as indica leaning strains

1419
00:49:28,750 --> 00:49:34,449
will react to heavy defoliation another

1420
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:36,820
thing I'll recommend is leave those two

1421
00:49:34,449 --> 00:49:39,399
leaves at the top of the bud you'll have

1422
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:40,930
one bud your main top sticking up then

1423
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:42,880
at the top of that there are two leaves

1424
00:49:40,929 --> 00:49:44,349
sticking out when you look in the grow

1425
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:46,690
room you'll see the two leaves I'm

1426
00:49:44,349 --> 00:49:49,119
talking about I like to leave those on

1427
00:49:46,690 --> 00:49:50,440
every plant those two mains that are

1428
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:52,449
sticking out of the top of the main bud

1429
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:55,269
I'd like to leave those until late in

1430
00:49:52,449 --> 00:49:58,389
flower but quite often those will be the

1431
00:49:55,269 --> 00:50:01,300
only large leaves I leave on every plant

1432
00:49:58,389 --> 00:50:03,279
so I recommend a semi heavy defoliation

1433
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:05,260
here at the beginning of flower then

1434
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:06,250
we'll do it again around a week four and

1435
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:09,670
we'll do it again

1436
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:11,590
around week six defoliating and cracking

1437
00:50:09,670 --> 00:50:14,500
and twisting and working into trellis

1438
00:50:11,590 --> 00:50:16,630
work is kind of an art you will have to

1439
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:19,420
get good at this over time which will

1440
00:50:16,630 --> 00:50:21,910
require confidence so don't be scared

1441
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:24,579
just get in there and learn how to do it

1442
00:50:21,909 --> 00:50:26,269
you are going to make mistakes I have

1443
00:50:24,579 --> 00:50:28,789
made countless mistakes

1444
00:50:26,269 --> 00:50:30,679
in my own Gro I've made mistakes and

1445
00:50:28,789 --> 00:50:32,179
commercial grows I have made tiny

1446
00:50:30,679 --> 00:50:34,759
mistakes and I have made huge mistakes

1447
00:50:32,179 --> 00:50:38,089
but you know what that's how I became a

1448
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:41,660
good grower experience includes mistakes

1449
00:50:38,090 --> 00:50:43,850
don't be afraid to make mistakes this is

1450
00:50:41,659 --> 00:50:46,489
not the last crop you are going to grow

1451
00:50:43,849 --> 00:50:48,739
this is a practice crop the next one

1452
00:50:46,489 --> 00:50:50,539
will be your pro crop don't act like

1453
00:50:48,739 --> 00:50:52,549
these plants are the last plants are

1454
00:50:50,539 --> 00:50:55,279
ever going to get to touch this is your

1455
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:56,990
first time this is your second time have

1456
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:58,940
some confidence build some confidence

1457
00:50:56,989 --> 00:51:00,589
let's just get in there and break some

1458
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:02,869
[ __ ] and ruin some [ __ ] so that you can

1459
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:05,119
see what can go wrong then the next row

1460
00:51:02,869 --> 00:51:06,950
will be really easy so don't be afraid

1461
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:08,720
to wreak some [ __ ] don't be afraid

1462
00:51:06,949 --> 00:51:11,868
because some problems that's how you

1463
00:51:08,719 --> 00:51:13,939
learn things if every grow goes smoothly

1464
00:51:11,869 --> 00:51:15,789
for you you're going to think growing is

1465
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:18,230
easy and you're not gonna learn anything

1466
00:51:15,789 --> 00:51:19,940
then your egos gonna get in the way and

1467
00:51:18,230 --> 00:51:21,590
that's when you're really gonna run into

1468
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:24,440
problems and then you will have no idea

1469
00:51:21,590 --> 00:51:25,940
how to solve them so my point is don't

1470
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:28,010
be scared just get in there and play

1471
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:29,960
with the plants you may kill one you may

1472
00:51:28,010 --> 00:51:31,970
kill two but you will learn what they

1473
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:34,460
can take these plants are way more

1474
00:51:31,969 --> 00:51:36,169
resilient than you would imagine if this

1475
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:37,940
is your first grow if this is your

1476
00:51:36,170 --> 00:51:39,019
second grow you're probably touching

1477
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:41,960
those plants like there are delicate

1478
00:51:39,019 --> 00:51:43,550
little babies when you see me in a

1479
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:45,740
commercial environment you're going to

1480
00:51:43,550 --> 00:51:47,869
think I am an abusive odor to these

1481
00:51:45,739 --> 00:51:49,939
plants but then at the end you will see

1482
00:51:47,869 --> 00:51:52,160
the highest quality most beautiful buds

1483
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:53,599
come out of these plants that I kind of

1484
00:51:52,159 --> 00:51:55,969
beat up through their whole life I

1485
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:58,159
really care for the plants I really have

1486
00:51:55,969 --> 00:51:59,449
a passion for the garden sometimes I'm

1487
00:51:58,159 --> 00:52:01,009
going really fast

1488
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:02,868
and I don't have time for [ __ ] and I

1489
00:52:01,010 --> 00:52:04,970
need to get a lot of stuff done in a

1490
00:52:02,869 --> 00:52:06,619
small amount of time and sometimes I get

1491
00:52:04,969 --> 00:52:09,019
a little rough and sometimes it looks

1492
00:52:06,619 --> 00:52:11,300
like I'm being aggressive and I am but

1493
00:52:09,019 --> 00:52:13,219
at the end of the day the plants show me

1494
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:14,780
that they were satisfied with what I did

1495
00:52:13,219 --> 00:52:16,939
these plants are used to being outside

1496
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:18,560
growing on a hill these plants are used

1497
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:20,480
to being stuck in one place and can't

1498
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:21,949
walk away when [ __ ] gets weird they've

1499
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:24,170
been in the wind they've been in the

1500
00:52:21,949 --> 00:52:25,699
rain they've been beat up by Nature some

1501
00:52:24,170 --> 00:52:28,970
of them probably got peed on by a goat

1502
00:52:25,699 --> 00:52:31,039
cannabis plants are amazingly resilient

1503
00:52:28,969 --> 00:52:32,750
plants and they can take some abuse

1504
00:52:31,039 --> 00:52:33,920
so let's abuse them let's beat them up a

1505
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:35,269
little bit and see what they can take

1506
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:37,010
because I think when we push them to

1507
00:52:35,269 --> 00:52:38,780
their limits that's when we see their

1508
00:52:37,010 --> 00:52:39,589
full potential so don't be afraid to get

1509
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:40,999
in there and

1510
00:52:39,588 --> 00:52:43,578
break some [ __ ] you guys this is not

1511
00:52:40,998 --> 00:52:45,588
going to be your last crop I understand

1512
00:52:43,579 --> 00:52:47,599
that seeds and clones are very expensive

1513
00:52:45,588 --> 00:52:49,759
and that this crop means a lot to you

1514
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:52,430
but if you can take one plant and

1515
00:52:49,759 --> 00:52:54,528
dedicate it to experiments you can learn

1516
00:52:52,429 --> 00:52:57,558
a whole lot from that one plant and

1517
00:52:54,528 --> 00:52:59,389
still produce a very viable crop so if

1518
00:52:57,559 --> 00:53:00,950
you're new and defoliation if you're new

1519
00:52:59,389 --> 00:53:03,048
at popping and twisting if you're new at

1520
00:53:00,949 --> 00:53:05,028
cracking the stems maybe just pick one

1521
00:53:03,048 --> 00:53:06,978
plant defoliate the crap out of one

1522
00:53:05,028 --> 00:53:09,199
plant and then don't do the others and

1523
00:53:06,978 --> 00:53:11,538
pay attention to what happens something

1524
00:53:09,199 --> 00:53:13,608
very important to note here take a lot

1525
00:53:11,539 --> 00:53:15,979
of notes when you're doing experiments

1526
00:53:13,608 --> 00:53:17,900
like this write down what you did to

1527
00:53:15,978 --> 00:53:20,028
plant a write down what you did to plant

1528
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:22,489
B and then take great notes of the

1529
00:53:20,028 --> 00:53:24,798
outcome that is a great way to have

1530
00:53:22,489 --> 00:53:26,150
documentation to find out if the

1531
00:53:24,798 --> 00:53:28,639
techniques and methods you were using

1532
00:53:26,150 --> 00:53:30,739
work for your garden and work for you

1533
00:53:28,639 --> 00:53:32,838
and work for the specific strain which

1534
00:53:30,739 --> 00:53:35,599
you are growing I've said it before but

1535
00:53:32,838 --> 00:53:38,420
most of us growers are also consumers

1536
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:41,298
which means sometimes we may forget some

1537
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:43,579
details write some [ __ ] down and you

1538
00:53:41,298 --> 00:53:45,710
will not forget that way when the end

1539
00:53:43,579 --> 00:53:48,259
comes and plant B is way better than

1540
00:53:45,710 --> 00:53:50,690
plant a you know exactly what you did to

1541
00:53:48,259 --> 00:53:53,659
make plant B stand out from the crowd

1542
00:53:50,690 --> 00:53:55,880
then we can repeat that then we can

1543
00:53:53,659 --> 00:53:58,578
improve upon that and have a better

1544
00:53:55,880 --> 00:54:00,440
garden each and every time so feel free

1545
00:53:58,579 --> 00:54:01,969
to experiment with one or two plants in

1546
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:04,460
the garden until you develop confidence

1547
00:54:01,969 --> 00:54:06,979
and while you're experimenting make sure

1548
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:08,210
to take notes now the next thing I want

1549
00:54:06,978 --> 00:54:11,358
to talk about before we start wrapping

1550
00:54:08,210 --> 00:54:13,249
up the show is bulbs and lighting as we

1551
00:54:11,358 --> 00:54:16,098
approach the third week of flower it is

1552
00:54:13,248 --> 00:54:18,048
time to remove our metal halide bulb and

1553
00:54:16,099 --> 00:54:21,019
start using the high-pressure sodium

1554
00:54:18,048 --> 00:54:22,900
bulb if you're using an LED it's time to

1555
00:54:21,018 --> 00:54:26,209
switch from the blue to the more red

1556
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:28,190
spectrum if that is an option I like to

1557
00:54:26,210 --> 00:54:30,829
leave my veg bulbs in for the first

1558
00:54:28,190 --> 00:54:33,469
couple of weeks of flower because I find

1559
00:54:30,829 --> 00:54:35,749
it helps reduce the stretch for the

1560
00:54:33,469 --> 00:54:37,999
first 21 days of flower our plants are

1561
00:54:35,748 --> 00:54:39,919
going to take off and stretch extremely

1562
00:54:37,998 --> 00:54:42,078
fast they're going to get really tall

1563
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:44,150
proper nutrients will help reduce the

1564
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:47,059
stretch the right amount of phosphorus

1565
00:54:44,150 --> 00:54:49,338
and potassium or reduce the stretch also

1566
00:54:47,059 --> 00:54:51,559
I feel like keeping in the blue light

1567
00:54:49,338 --> 00:54:53,630
the metal halide light for the first two

1568
00:54:51,559 --> 00:54:53,809
weeks of flower will really help keep

1569
00:54:53,630 --> 00:54:56,930
the

1570
00:54:53,809 --> 00:54:58,789
plants short and squat and bushy now we

1571
00:54:56,929 --> 00:55:01,669
are approaching the end of the stretch

1572
00:54:58,789 --> 00:55:04,219
phase it is time to swap out that blue

1573
00:55:01,670 --> 00:55:06,108
bulb for the yellow orange reddish bulb

1574
00:55:04,219 --> 00:55:08,358
which would be the high-pressure sodium

1575
00:55:06,108 --> 00:55:10,308
so if you have not already changed out

1576
00:55:08,358 --> 00:55:13,338
your bulb or hit the switch on your led

1577
00:55:10,309 --> 00:55:15,380
to change into the flowering mode now is

1578
00:55:13,338 --> 00:55:17,748
the time to swap out those bulbs or hit

1579
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:20,869
that switch I wouldn't wait any later

1580
00:55:17,748 --> 00:55:23,149
than day 21 to change my flowering

1581
00:55:20,869 --> 00:55:24,439
spectrum any later than that we start

1582
00:55:23,150 --> 00:55:26,838
hitting a point of diminishing returns

1583
00:55:24,438 --> 00:55:29,179
we do reduce the stretch but we also

1584
00:55:26,838 --> 00:55:30,349
reduce the bulking when it comes time to

1585
00:55:29,179 --> 00:55:32,328
develop buds

1586
00:55:30,349 --> 00:55:35,028
all right podcast rolled I feel like we

1587
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:36,469
are caught up on weeks 2 &amp; 3 we've got

1588
00:55:35,028 --> 00:55:38,688
our nutrients covered we've got our

1589
00:55:36,469 --> 00:55:40,699
environment dialed in we've added a fan

1590
00:55:38,688 --> 00:55:42,618
we have applied our final pesticide

1591
00:55:40,699 --> 00:55:44,688
applications we have released our

1592
00:55:42,619 --> 00:55:46,729
predators if we're going to do so we're

1593
00:55:44,688 --> 00:55:48,379
going to continue popping the stems

1594
00:55:46,728 --> 00:55:50,389
we're gonna continue working the tall

1595
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:53,239
plants into the trellis we're going to

1596
00:55:50,389 --> 00:55:55,219
keep deep foliated hopefully you have

1597
00:55:53,239 --> 00:55:57,438
selected a plant to do some experiments

1598
00:55:55,219 --> 00:56:00,019
on and you are taking good notes we are

1599
00:55:57,438 --> 00:56:02,239
well into the flowering cycle we do need

1600
00:56:00,018 --> 00:56:05,448
to continue keeping our eyes open for

1601
00:56:02,239 --> 00:56:08,630
males and hermaphrodites and mutants as

1602
00:56:05,449 --> 00:56:10,099
well as pests and pathogens hopefully we

1603
00:56:08,630 --> 00:56:12,079
haven't made any nutrient mistakes

1604
00:56:10,099 --> 00:56:13,969
hopefully we haven't had any pH issues

1605
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:15,439
if we haven't had any light leaks we're

1606
00:56:13,969 --> 00:56:17,269
developing bud set it looks like

1607
00:56:15,438 --> 00:56:19,728
dandelions forming on the tips of all of

1608
00:56:17,268 --> 00:56:21,198
our plants hopefully we have removed all

1609
00:56:19,728 --> 00:56:22,458
of the males from the room we're still

1610
00:56:21,199 --> 00:56:25,219
keeping an eye out for males and

1611
00:56:22,458 --> 00:56:26,928
hermaphrodites and mutants now as long

1612
00:56:25,219 --> 00:56:29,150
as we don't run into any equipment

1613
00:56:26,929 --> 00:56:31,400
failures or human errors we are well on

1614
00:56:29,150 --> 00:56:33,709
our way to a great harvest

1615
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:35,599
all right podcast world I feel like that

1616
00:56:33,708 --> 00:56:38,268
is a great spot to wrap up this lesson

1617
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:41,449
on weeks two and three or days eight

1618
00:56:38,268 --> 00:56:42,889
through 21 of the flowering phase I want

you know what I'm smoking today I've

1664
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:22,108
been taking dabs of goat power from

1665
00:58:20,369 --> 00:58:24,509
apothecary farms I picked this up at

1666
00:58:22,108 --> 00:58:25,920
their Pueblo medical location big

1667
00:58:24,509 --> 00:58:28,259
shout-out to our friends at apothecary

1668
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:30,389
the potency label on this concentrate

1669
00:58:28,259 --> 00:58:33,239
says it is seventy four point eight

1670
00:58:30,389 --> 00:58:35,278
percent THC and eighty six point four

1671
00:58:33,239 --> 00:58:36,599
percent total cannabinoids this stuff

1672
00:58:35,278 --> 00:58:38,849
smells delicious if you have ever

1673
00:58:36,599 --> 00:58:40,739
smelled or smoked a golden goat this is

1674
00:58:38,849 --> 00:58:42,239
exactly what golden goat smells like to

1675
00:58:40,739 --> 00:58:45,420
me I'm giving it a fresh smell so I can

1676
00:58:42,239 --> 00:58:47,999
give you a fair description it's got a

1677
00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:49,889
hint of citrus not overpowering citrus

1678
00:58:47,998 --> 00:58:52,949
but it does have a citrus base to it

1679
00:58:49,889 --> 00:58:55,920
with a tropical pineapple and a juicy

1680
00:58:52,949 --> 00:58:58,139
fruit gum sort of aroma on top of it -

1681
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:59,818
that stickiness that a juicy fruit

1682
00:58:58,139 --> 00:59:01,318
piece of gum would have I know it's

1683
00:58:59,818 --> 00:59:02,940
weird to say something smells sticky I

1684
00:59:01,318 --> 00:59:04,980
think that stickiness is part of the

1685
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:06,210
flavor and aroma of the gum it doesn't

1686
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:08,998
have that it's got that tropical

1687
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:11,670
sweetness it's got some citrus it's got

1688
00:59:08,998 --> 00:59:13,889
a hint of pineapple mostly a citrus and

1689
00:59:11,670 --> 00:59:16,318
tropical fruit sort of a thing going on

1690
00:59:13,889 --> 00:59:19,288
I would really describe it as a orange

1691
00:59:16,318 --> 00:59:20,969
pineapple tropical fruit Jolly Rancher

1692
00:59:19,289 --> 00:59:22,920
would probably be the most a cure

1693
00:59:20,969 --> 00:59:25,348
description that I could nail it down -

1694
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:27,690
so that's the aroma and flavor it has

1695
00:59:25,349 --> 00:59:29,010
got a beautiful golden color to it it's

1696
00:59:27,690 --> 00:59:30,809
got just the right amount of diamonds

1697
00:59:29,010 --> 00:59:33,359
just the right amount of sauce in there

1698
00:59:30,809 --> 00:59:35,009
beautiful beautiful goat power from our

1699
00:59:33,358 --> 00:59:37,170
friends at apothecary farms and

1700
00:59:35,010 --> 00:59:39,420
obviously it has got me amped up and

1701
00:59:37,170 --> 00:59:41,849
ready to talk my face off so this should

1702
00:59:39,420 --> 00:59:43,590
be a great podcast if you've been

1703
00:59:41,849 --> 00:59:45,720
following along you know I've been doing

1704
00:59:43,590 --> 00:59:48,690
a long series of in-depth grow lessons

1705
00:59:45,719 --> 00:59:50,519
in episode 351 we talked about setting a

1706
00:59:48,690 --> 00:59:52,619
goal for the garden then we talked about

1707
00:59:50,519 --> 00:59:53,880
picking a space for the garden then we

1708
00:59:52,619 --> 00:59:55,619
talked about the appropriate equipment

1709
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:57,570
and setting up the grow safely and

1710
00:59:55,619 --> 00:59:59,820
effectively then we work our way through

1711
00:59:57,570 --> 01:00:01,830
getting clones and starting to grow at

1712
00:59:59,820 --> 01:00:04,289
this point we are all the way to week

1713
01:00:01,829 --> 01:00:06,179
four of the grow in this episode we're

1714
01:00:04,289 --> 01:00:08,880
going to talk about weeks four five and

1715
01:00:06,179 --> 01:00:11,129
six if you're a new grower or if you're

1716
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:13,500
new to the podcast I suggest you head

1717
01:00:11,130 --> 01:00:15,269
back to episode 351 and start with the

1718
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:16,920
Dro lessons there if you are an

1719
01:00:15,269 --> 01:00:18,719
experienced grower or if you feel like

1720
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:21,030
you were up to speed or if you've been

1721
01:00:18,719 --> 01:00:23,549
following along let's jump right into a

1722
01:00:21,030 --> 01:00:26,250
grow lesson in this lesson we are going

1723
01:00:23,550 --> 01:00:28,980
to focus on episodes four five and six

1724
01:00:26,250 --> 01:00:30,570
of the flowering phase at this point of

1725
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:32,159
flowering it should be obvious where the

1726
01:00:30,570 --> 01:00:33,930
bud sites are going to be you should

1727
01:00:32,159 --> 01:00:35,399
have little buds popping up they should

1728
01:00:33,929 --> 01:00:36,929
look like little dandelions they're

1729
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:39,000
starting to actually form into buds by

1730
01:00:36,929 --> 01:00:41,699
now it should be clearly obvious where

1731
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:43,380
the buds are it should also be more than

1732
01:00:41,699 --> 01:00:45,899
obvious which plants are males and

1733
01:00:43,380 --> 01:00:48,390
females all of the males better be gone

1734
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:50,160
by now or you have pollinated everything

1735
01:00:48,389 --> 01:00:52,650
and you're going to have a seeded crop

1736
01:00:50,159 --> 01:00:54,899
so all of the males are gone at this

1737
01:00:52,650 --> 01:00:56,760
point at this point your buds are

1738
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:58,858
starting to form you're seeing little

1739
01:00:56,760 --> 01:01:01,200
pistol hairy covered buds you're

1740
01:00:58,858 --> 01:01:03,329
starting to get minimal bud mass at this

1741
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:05,759
point we are also coming out of that

1742
01:01:03,329 --> 01:01:07,409
rapid stretch phase for the first three

1743
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:09,390
weeks of flowering our plants really

1744
01:01:07,409 --> 01:01:11,489
like to stretch and take off that is

1745
01:01:09,389 --> 01:01:13,108
pretty much over our plants are still

1746
01:01:11,489 --> 01:01:15,479
going to get taller hopefully that top

1747
01:01:13,108 --> 01:01:17,429
bud grows gigantic but that rapid

1748
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:18,780
stretch phase is over we don't have to

1749
01:01:17,429 --> 01:01:20,819
worry so much about the plants just

1750
01:01:18,780 --> 01:01:22,290
taking off on us anymore they're going

1751
01:01:20,820 --> 01:01:23,910
to stop stretching and they're going to

1752
01:01:22,289 --> 01:01:26,338
start focusing their energy more on

1753
01:01:23,909 --> 01:01:28,529
developing the fat chunky buds we want

1754
01:01:26,338 --> 01:01:31,108
now at this point if you don't have a

1755
01:01:28,530 --> 01:01:33,119
carbon filter it is really time to get a

1756
01:01:31,108 --> 01:01:34,619
carbon filter in your grow room if

1757
01:01:33,119 --> 01:01:36,390
you've got any air exit

1758
01:01:34,619 --> 01:01:38,640
the grow going outside that the

1759
01:01:36,389 --> 01:01:40,679
neighbors may smell you need a carbon

1760
01:01:38,639 --> 01:01:43,139
filter by now things are going to start

1761
01:01:40,679 --> 01:01:45,629
getting really aromatic from here on out

1762
01:01:43,139 --> 01:01:47,879
it is only going to get worse so keep

1763
01:01:45,630 --> 01:01:50,220
your odor under control I've said it

1764
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:52,470
before a very common way for your garden

1765
01:01:50,219 --> 01:01:54,389
to be discovered is for the aroma to be

1766
01:01:52,469 --> 01:01:56,129
noticed by a neighbor the neighbors call

1767
01:01:54,389 --> 01:01:57,719
the police the police driver on the

1768
01:01:56,130 --> 01:01:59,369
block they narrow it down they knock on

1769
01:01:57,719 --> 01:02:01,078
your door by the time they hit the front

1770
01:01:59,369 --> 01:02:02,970
porch they can smell it they know it's

1771
01:02:01,079 --> 01:02:04,769
you they come knock on the door if you

1772
01:02:02,969 --> 01:02:06,509
are in a legal state they want to count

1773
01:02:04,768 --> 01:02:08,068
your plants it's still a pain in the ass

1774
01:02:06,509 --> 01:02:10,559
you've got law enforcement in the house

1775
01:02:08,068 --> 01:02:13,230
in the Gros it's stressful if you are in

1776
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:14,670
a non legal area if whoever shows up at

1777
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:16,199
your front door feels that they have got

1778
01:02:14,670 --> 01:02:18,180
probable cause to come into your house

1779
01:02:16,199 --> 01:02:20,460
they can come they can discover your

1780
01:02:18,179 --> 01:02:22,108
grow you may be handy with the laws you

1781
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:24,480
may speak well you may know how to keep

1782
01:02:22,108 --> 01:02:25,920
them out of the house for now but if the

1783
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:27,389
aroma was strong enough if their

1784
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:29,068
suspicion was strong enough they're

1785
01:02:27,389 --> 01:02:30,989
going to contact the judge they will

1786
01:02:29,068 --> 01:02:32,489
have a warrant and in several days it

1787
01:02:30,989 --> 01:02:34,709
will be back they'll pull off the front

1788
01:02:32,489 --> 01:02:36,479
door it will come in armed it will be

1789
01:02:34,710 --> 01:02:38,940
scary as [ __ ] it will destroy your

1790
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:41,670
entire garden and ask questions later so

1791
01:02:38,940 --> 01:02:43,798
now is the time to have a carbon filter

1792
01:02:41,670 --> 01:02:45,809
always be thinking about safety and

1793
01:02:43,798 --> 01:02:48,538
security if you were growing in a legal

1794
01:02:45,809 --> 01:02:50,220
or not legal state you probably don't

1795
01:02:48,539 --> 01:02:52,170
even notice how pungent your garden is

1796
01:02:50,219 --> 01:02:54,268
because you're there every day but the

1797
01:02:52,170 --> 01:02:55,798
first time the mailman walks in front of

1798
01:02:54,268 --> 01:02:58,139
the house and catches a little whiff

1799
01:02:55,798 --> 01:03:00,480
he's going to know exactly what that is

1800
01:02:58,139 --> 01:03:03,328
the first time a little bit of aroma

1801
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:05,548
while and hits your neighbor right in

1802
01:03:03,329 --> 01:03:08,818
her nose she's going to know exactly

1803
01:03:05,548 --> 01:03:10,920
what that aroma is immediately in this

1804
01:03:08,818 --> 01:03:12,808
scenario we are only four weeks into

1805
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:15,809
flower and our plants are beginning to

1806
01:03:12,809 --> 01:03:18,298
stink it is only going to get worse by

1807
01:03:15,809 --> 01:03:20,160
week seven eight and nine it is going to

1808
01:03:18,298 --> 01:03:22,079
be pungent as soon as we start

1809
01:03:20,159 --> 01:03:24,629
harvesting these plants and trimming the

1810
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:27,180
plants that aroma is going to increase

1811
01:03:24,630 --> 01:03:29,430
exponentially don't add that extra

1812
01:03:27,179 --> 01:03:31,169
stress to yourself by stinking up the

1813
01:03:29,429 --> 01:03:33,179
entire neighborhood with your grow I

1814
01:03:31,170 --> 01:03:35,309
understand that buying a carbon filter

1815
01:03:33,179 --> 01:03:37,230
and an extraction fan sound like just

1816
01:03:35,309 --> 01:03:39,119
another expense to a new grower but I

1817
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:41,579
would much rather invest that money in a

1818
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:43,858
filter and a blower than my lawyer and

1819
01:03:41,579 --> 01:03:45,989
bail alright I feel like I've made my

1820
01:03:43,858 --> 01:03:47,699
point it is time for a carbon filter if

1821
01:03:45,989 --> 01:03:48,869
you don't have one now it is time to

1822
01:03:47,699 --> 01:03:50,969
start taking the steps

1823
01:03:48,869 --> 01:03:52,559
to get a carbon filter in your garden

1824
01:03:50,969 --> 01:03:54,449
all right I feel like that's a good

1825
01:03:52,559 --> 01:03:56,519
overview of what's going on in the

1826
01:03:54,449 --> 01:03:58,318
garden buds are showing the stretch

1827
01:03:56,518 --> 01:03:59,098
phase is over and it is starting to

1828
01:03:58,318 --> 01:04:01,139
stink

1829
01:03:59,099 --> 01:04:04,410
now let's talk about the environment in

1830
01:04:01,139 --> 01:04:06,690
our grow for weeks four five and six

1831
01:04:04,409 --> 01:04:08,998
let's start with temperature for a

1832
01:04:06,690 --> 01:04:12,298
daytime temperature four weeks four five

1833
01:04:08,998 --> 01:04:14,459
and six I would suggest a range of 70 to

1834
01:04:12,298 --> 01:04:16,230
80 degrees Fahrenheit now if you can

1835
01:04:14,460 --> 01:04:19,920
dial it in a little tighter I would like

1836
01:04:16,230 --> 01:04:21,719
to be between 74 and 77 degrees now

1837
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:24,088
during the night I would suggest a

1838
01:04:21,719 --> 01:04:26,189
temperature in the range of 60 to 70

1839
01:04:24,088 --> 01:04:29,719
degrees if you can dial it in nice and

1840
01:04:26,190 --> 01:04:33,028
tight I would recommend 65 to 68 degrees

1841
01:04:29,719 --> 01:04:35,219
again I'm going to suggest no more than

1842
01:04:33,028 --> 01:04:37,498
a 10 degree difference in your day and

1843
01:04:35,219 --> 01:04:40,259
night temperature what that means is if

1844
01:04:37,498 --> 01:04:41,788
your day temperature is 77 degrees you

1845
01:04:40,259 --> 01:04:44,759
don't want your night temperature any

1846
01:04:41,789 --> 01:04:47,430
lower than 67 degrees we don't want to

1847
01:04:44,759 --> 01:04:50,068
see any more than a 10 degree diurnal

1848
01:04:47,429 --> 01:04:51,929
temperature variation if we allow

1849
01:04:50,068 --> 01:04:54,088
drastic temperature drops in the night

1850
01:04:51,929 --> 01:04:56,338
cycle we will slow down the plant growth

1851
01:04:54,088 --> 01:04:58,710
and we will also encourage powdery

1852
01:04:56,338 --> 01:05:00,869
mildew development so again during the

1853
01:04:58,710 --> 01:05:03,119
day we want to be between 70 and 80

1854
01:05:00,869 --> 01:05:06,778
degrees at night we want to be between

1855
01:05:03,119 --> 01:05:08,670
60 and 70 degrees now as time goes on we

1856
01:05:06,778 --> 01:05:11,039
are going to want to reduce the

1857
01:05:08,670 --> 01:05:12,720
temperature of the grow room later in

1858
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:15,210
Flour we want to make the room a little

1859
01:05:12,719 --> 01:05:17,488
bit cooler so if you are struggling to

1860
01:05:15,210 --> 01:05:19,889
get the room to 74 at this point maybe

1861
01:05:17,489 --> 01:05:22,470
just keep it up there at 78 79 degrees

1862
01:05:19,889 --> 01:05:24,179
so that when weeks 8 &amp; 9 come around we

1863
01:05:22,469 --> 01:05:26,038
can reduce that temperature down to as

1864
01:05:24,179 --> 01:05:28,618
low as you can get it if the lowest you

1865
01:05:26,039 --> 01:05:30,630
can get it is 74 let's wait until weeks

1866
01:05:28,619 --> 01:05:33,539
8 &amp; 9 to get it there and leave it

1867
01:05:30,630 --> 01:05:35,039
around 77 now now I know a lot of people

1868
01:05:33,539 --> 01:05:36,630
are going to say why do we want to make

1869
01:05:35,039 --> 01:05:39,089
it cooler there are several reasons

1870
01:05:36,630 --> 01:05:41,430
think about a plant outside as the

1871
01:05:39,088 --> 01:05:43,498
seasons change it gets colder it knows

1872
01:05:41,429 --> 01:05:45,929
oh [ __ ] the end of the season is coming

1873
01:05:43,498 --> 01:05:47,129
I need to ripen up I need to finish so

1874
01:05:45,929 --> 01:05:49,288
that will encourage the plants have

1875
01:05:47,130 --> 01:05:51,660
finish it will also encourage beautiful

1876
01:05:49,289 --> 01:05:54,839
colors it will also encourage more

1877
01:05:51,659 --> 01:05:56,670
terpene production heat and light break

1878
01:05:54,838 --> 01:05:58,199
down terpenes so why not make it a

1879
01:05:56,670 --> 01:06:01,019
little bit cooler where we can preserve

1880
01:05:58,199 --> 01:06:02,049
a little bit more Terps I also feel that

1881
01:06:01,018 --> 01:06:03,879
that little bit of coal

1882
01:06:02,050 --> 01:06:06,100
old toward the end will increase in

1883
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:09,460
density you will get tighter more dense

1884
01:06:06,099 --> 01:06:11,500
buds it also will help reduce humidity

1885
01:06:09,460 --> 01:06:13,150
and late in flower we need a little bit

1886
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:15,099
less humidity because we've got those

1887
01:06:13,150 --> 01:06:16,780
big chunky buds and we don't want to

1888
01:06:15,099 --> 01:06:18,909
develop bud rot in the middle of our

1889
01:06:16,780 --> 01:06:21,910
flowers so reducing the temperature

1890
01:06:18,909 --> 01:06:24,129
later in flower has many advantages I

1891
01:06:21,909 --> 01:06:25,539
understand that not all rooms are set up

1892
01:06:24,130 --> 01:06:27,490
to be able to reduce the temperature

1893
01:06:25,539 --> 01:06:29,500
late in flower you may be running a

1894
01:06:27,489 --> 01:06:31,239
perpetual cycle you just simply may not

1895
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:33,909
have the equipment to get it that cool

1896
01:06:31,239 --> 01:06:35,559
in flower it is not a requirement it is

1897
01:06:33,909 --> 01:06:38,139
just a little bonus it's a little tip

1898
01:06:35,559 --> 01:06:41,500
and trick that may help increase aroma

1899
01:06:38,139 --> 01:06:43,809
and color and density and also help you

1900
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:45,429
avoid powdery mildew and boy Titus

1901
01:06:43,809 --> 01:06:48,340
toward the end of your flowering phase

1902
01:06:45,429 --> 01:06:50,529
so that is why I suggest reducing the

1903
01:06:48,340 --> 01:06:52,450
temperature late in flower we will talk

1904
01:06:50,530 --> 01:06:54,730
more about that as we move through these

1905
01:06:52,449 --> 01:06:57,849
grow lessons now let's talk about

1906
01:06:54,730 --> 01:06:59,980
humidity four weeks four five and six

1907
01:06:57,849 --> 01:07:02,829
I suggest forty percent relative

1908
01:06:59,980 --> 01:07:04,960
humidity we have reduced the humidity by

1909
01:07:02,829 --> 01:07:06,610
10 percent from last week we don't need

1910
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:08,860
as much moisture in the air we're

1911
01:07:06,610 --> 01:07:10,720
starting to develop buds those buds act

1912
01:07:08,860 --> 01:07:12,640
like sponges they will gather all of

1913
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:14,439
that moisture in the air which will lead

1914
01:07:12,639 --> 01:07:16,389
to Boyte Rytas which is our worst

1915
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:18,970
nightmare when we get giant buds in a

1916
01:07:16,389 --> 01:07:20,980
commercial facility so let's reduce the

1917
01:07:18,969 --> 01:07:22,899
humidity let's get it down to about 40

1918
01:07:20,980 --> 01:07:25,360
percent now let's talk a little bit

1919
01:07:22,900 --> 01:07:28,420
about nutrients for weeks four five and

1920
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:30,730
six I know I don't give detailed

1921
01:07:28,420 --> 01:07:32,710
information when I talk about nutrients

1922
01:07:30,730 --> 01:07:34,449
in these grow lessons that's because I

1923
01:07:32,710 --> 01:07:36,159
don't know what brand of nutrients you

1924
01:07:34,449 --> 01:07:37,659
were using I don't know if you're using

1925
01:07:36,159 --> 01:07:39,519
bottles I don't know if you're using

1926
01:07:37,659 --> 01:07:41,769
powder nutrients I don't know if you're

1927
01:07:39,519 --> 01:07:43,659
running organics I have no idea what you

1928
01:07:41,769 --> 01:07:45,670
have chosen to do I can't be too

1929
01:07:43,659 --> 01:07:48,369
specific with the nutrient suggestions

1930
01:07:45,670 --> 01:07:50,369
what I can do is make sure we cover the

1931
01:07:48,369 --> 01:07:52,659
bases and I give you a solid foundation

1932
01:07:50,369 --> 01:07:55,329
so here are the things I would make sure

1933
01:07:52,659 --> 01:07:58,239
to have in my nutrient mix four weeks

1934
01:07:55,329 --> 01:08:01,360
four five and six if you were running

1935
01:07:58,239 --> 01:08:03,549
bottles you need a basic bloom nutrient

1936
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:05,440
you may have a bottle that says bloom

1937
01:08:03,550 --> 01:08:07,900
you may have a bottle that says bloom a

1938
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:09,610
and a bottle that says bloom B those

1939
01:08:07,900 --> 01:08:11,500
bottles are what we need for this stage

1940
01:08:09,610 --> 01:08:13,450
of flowering you'll notice that those

1941
01:08:11,500 --> 01:08:14,320
bottles have three numbers printed on

1942
01:08:13,449 --> 01:08:17,108
them that is an

1943
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:19,270
PK value at this stage of flowering we

1944
01:08:17,109 --> 01:08:21,070
do not need a lot of nitrogen we just

1945
01:08:19,270 --> 01:08:23,650
need a lot of nitrogen to provide energy

1946
01:08:21,069 --> 01:08:25,299
to the plants at this stage of flowering

1947
01:08:23,649 --> 01:08:27,608
we need more phosphorus and potassium

1948
01:08:25,300 --> 01:08:30,039
than we have previously needed in the

1949
01:08:27,609 --> 01:08:32,620
grow so you will see a low n number and

1950
01:08:30,039 --> 01:08:35,319
higher P and K value numbers on your

1951
01:08:32,619 --> 01:08:37,000
bloom nutrient bottles so if you're

1952
01:08:35,319 --> 01:08:39,369
growing with bottles hopefully your

1953
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:41,800
bloom base has covered your nitrogen

1954
01:08:39,369 --> 01:08:44,229
phosphorus and potassium you will also

1955
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:47,350
need cal-mag at this phase of the game I

1956
01:08:44,229 --> 01:08:49,989
also recommend enzymes and microbes I

1957
01:08:47,350 --> 01:08:52,390
would also introduce a kelp product to

1958
01:08:49,989 --> 01:08:54,159
my feeding regimen I think help has a

1959
01:08:52,390 --> 01:08:56,800
lot of great benefits that we will talk

1960
01:08:54,159 --> 01:08:59,139
about in a future episode this is also a

1961
01:08:56,800 --> 01:09:01,810
great time to start introducing a bloom

1962
01:08:59,140 --> 01:09:03,190
booster again I don't know what products

1963
01:09:01,810 --> 01:09:05,589
you're using I don't know what brand you

1964
01:09:03,189 --> 01:09:08,619
have chosen most bottled nutrients offer

1965
01:09:05,588 --> 01:09:10,659
a very obvious bloom booster now is the

1966
01:09:08,619 --> 01:09:12,849
time to start implementing that into

1967
01:09:10,659 --> 01:09:14,470
your feeding schedule if you really want

1968
01:09:12,850 --> 01:09:16,359
to provide energy to your plants you can

1969
01:09:14,470 --> 01:09:18,250
feed them a carbohydrate product at this

1970
01:09:16,359 --> 01:09:19,810
stage of flowering the carbohydrates

1971
01:09:18,250 --> 01:09:21,399
will give the plants energy and the

1972
01:09:19,810 --> 01:09:23,950
carbohydrates will also feed your

1973
01:09:21,399 --> 01:09:25,809
microbes if you are growing with veg

1974
01:09:23,949 --> 01:09:27,729
bloom powdered nutrients I would have

1975
01:09:25,810 --> 01:09:30,339
added shine by now I definitely would

1976
01:09:27,729 --> 01:09:32,349
put shine in there by week 3 now is

1977
01:09:30,338 --> 01:09:34,569
basically the time I start tapering off

1978
01:09:32,350 --> 01:09:36,760
the microbe products and start adding in

1979
01:09:34,569 --> 01:09:39,009
the bloom booster products the roots

1980
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:40,989
should be big and fat and healthy by the

1981
01:09:39,010 --> 01:09:43,060
time the plant is done I want that plant

1982
01:09:40,989 --> 01:09:44,858
to be nearly root bound so we are well

1983
01:09:43,060 --> 01:09:46,839
on our way to filling that pot with

1984
01:09:44,859 --> 01:09:48,880
roots now I want to start focusing on

1985
01:09:46,838 --> 01:09:51,789
moving that energy up top and making big

1986
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:53,680
giant buds so through weeks 4 5 &amp; 6 I

1987
01:09:51,789 --> 01:09:56,019
start tapering off the microbes and I

1988
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:58,360
start increasing the bloom booster

1989
01:09:56,020 --> 01:10:00,250
product now be careful with your bloom

1990
01:09:58,359 --> 01:10:03,339
boosters a lot of people want to

1991
01:10:00,250 --> 01:10:05,590
overfeed the bloom booster most bottled

1992
01:10:03,340 --> 01:10:08,260
nutrient companies have a very clear

1993
01:10:05,590 --> 01:10:11,020
suggested dose printed on the bottle

1994
01:10:08,260 --> 01:10:13,390
most of the time that is too much they

1995
01:10:11,020 --> 01:10:14,710
want you to feed your plants too much so

1996
01:10:13,390 --> 01:10:17,320
that you have to buy more of their

1997
01:10:14,710 --> 01:10:20,199
product more frequently I would suggest

1998
01:10:17,319 --> 01:10:23,229
that a new grower starts off with 50% of

1999
01:10:20,199 --> 01:10:25,029
the recommended bloom booster dosage the

2000
01:10:23,229 --> 01:10:27,549
first time you add that bloom booster to

2001
01:10:25,029 --> 01:10:29,319
your plant feed only put 50% of the

2002
01:10:27,550 --> 01:10:31,779
recommended dosage and see how the

2003
01:10:29,319 --> 01:10:34,389
plants respond if the plants don't show

2004
01:10:31,779 --> 01:10:36,399
any sign of burn or stunted growth maybe

2005
01:10:34,389 --> 01:10:38,650
increase the feeding just a little bit

2006
01:10:36,399 --> 01:10:41,289
next time and increase it until you see

2007
01:10:38,649 --> 01:10:42,578
the leaf tips just barely burn I like to

2008
01:10:41,289 --> 01:10:43,779
call it getting their nails done because

2009
01:10:42,578 --> 01:10:44,710
it starts to look like the end of the

2010
01:10:43,779 --> 01:10:46,448
fingers are just getting their

2011
01:10:44,710 --> 01:10:48,189
fingernails on there when you see them

2012
01:10:46,448 --> 01:10:49,388
starting to get their nails done that's

2013
01:10:48,189 --> 01:10:50,859
when you know you're pushing them to

2014
01:10:49,389 --> 01:10:52,779
their limit and they're just starting to

2015
01:10:50,859 --> 01:10:54,399
get burned you can either give them that

2016
01:10:52,779 --> 01:10:56,319
much again and just keep burning them

2017
01:10:54,399 --> 01:10:58,719
just a little bit or you can reduce it a

2018
01:10:56,319 --> 01:11:00,488
little bit but do not go any harder with

2019
01:10:58,719 --> 01:11:02,920
the bloom booster once you see the

2020
01:11:00,488 --> 01:11:04,839
fingernails start happening now it

2021
01:11:02,920 --> 01:11:06,670
sounds natural and feels natural to want

2022
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:08,800
to add more bloom booster that's going

2023
01:11:06,670 --> 01:11:10,779
to give you bigger fatter buds that's

2024
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:13,000
what everybody wants but there is a

2025
01:11:10,779 --> 01:11:15,189
point of diminishing returns if you add

2026
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:16,960
too much it will burn the plants once

2027
01:11:15,189 --> 01:11:18,789
the plants begin to burn it will start

2028
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:20,679
to lock out nutrients once they lock out

2029
01:11:18,789 --> 01:11:22,328
nutrients they will not take any of your

2030
01:11:20,679 --> 01:11:23,770
bloom booster then it all becomes a

2031
01:11:22,328 --> 01:11:26,710
waste of money and you have a shitty

2032
01:11:23,770 --> 01:11:28,630
harvest so don't be that guy don't over

2033
01:11:26,710 --> 01:11:30,429
bloom boost your plants five or six

2034
01:11:28,630 --> 01:11:31,989
weeks into flower and completely burn

2035
01:11:30,429 --> 01:11:33,760
them and make them look like [ __ ] and

2036
01:11:31,988 --> 01:11:36,308
ruin your trop when you've only got

2037
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:38,590
three weeks to go now those are just the

2038
01:11:36,309 --> 01:11:40,929
basic nutrients I would recommend if you

2039
01:11:38,590 --> 01:11:43,360
are growing from bottled nutrients every

2040
01:11:40,929 --> 01:11:45,399
company is going to have other products

2041
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:47,380
to offer some companies may offer a

2042
01:11:45,399 --> 01:11:49,779
silicate product some companies may

2043
01:11:47,380 --> 01:11:51,730
offer a terpene enhancer some companies

2044
01:11:49,779 --> 01:11:53,710
may recommend a bud hardener I'm not

2045
01:11:51,729 --> 01:11:55,388
sure what company you have chosen but be

2046
01:11:53,710 --> 01:11:57,520
careful when adding your additives and

2047
01:11:55,389 --> 01:11:59,500
just pay attention when mixing make sure

2048
01:11:57,520 --> 01:12:02,320
that your pH is correct and tried to

2049
01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:04,359
make note of your EC or your ppm s if

2050
01:12:02,319 --> 01:12:06,158
possible now if you're growing with

2051
01:12:04,359 --> 01:12:07,960
organics if you're growing with super

2052
01:12:06,158 --> 01:12:09,368
soil you have probably mixed up your

2053
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:11,380
soil at the beginning and there's not a

2054
01:12:09,368 --> 01:12:13,779
lot you can do to it at this point other

2055
01:12:11,380 --> 01:12:16,659
than adding teas or maybe adding a cover

2056
01:12:13,779 --> 01:12:18,429
crop or possibly a top dress to be quite

2057
01:12:16,658 --> 01:12:20,799
honest with you that is not my area of

2058
01:12:18,429 --> 01:12:22,510
expertise if you are growing organically

2059
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:24,489
and you want to boost up your plants a

2060
01:12:22,510 --> 01:12:27,250
little bit I would probably suggest a

2061
01:12:24,488 --> 01:12:28,959
compost tea that included worm castings

2062
01:12:27,250 --> 01:12:31,868
and it would probably include some sort

2063
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:34,510
of guano but again I am NOT the organic

2064
01:12:31,868 --> 01:12:36,698
expert I am NOT the no-till guy I am NOT

2065
01:12:34,510 --> 01:12:38,590
a super soil guy I honestly grow in a

2066
01:12:36,698 --> 01:12:40,928
commercial environment and I grow from

2067
01:12:38,590 --> 01:12:42,369
bottle and powdered nutrients most

2068
01:12:40,929 --> 01:12:44,859
of the advice and guidance that I give

2069
01:12:42,368 --> 01:12:47,618
you on the show will be based on bottled

2070
01:12:44,859 --> 01:12:50,018
or powdered nutrients so I feel like

2071
01:12:47,618 --> 01:12:52,569
that covers the basics of nutrients for

2072
01:12:50,019 --> 01:12:54,969
weeks four five and six basically we

2073
01:12:52,569 --> 01:12:57,069
want to give them a solid NPK a little

2074
01:12:54,969 --> 01:12:59,078
bit of cal-mag some enzymes some

2075
01:12:57,069 --> 01:13:01,478
microbes some carbs I would introduce

2076
01:12:59,078 --> 01:13:03,368
kelp I would introduce a bloom booster

2077
01:13:01,479 --> 01:13:05,769
and basically at this point I would

2078
01:13:03,368 --> 01:13:07,509
start reducing the microbe product and I

2079
01:13:05,769 --> 01:13:09,369
would start replacing the microbes with

2080
01:13:07,510 --> 01:13:11,829
a bloom booster product over the next

2081
01:13:09,368 --> 01:13:13,839
couple of weeks all right now I feel

2082
01:13:11,828 --> 01:13:15,670
like we know what type of environment to

2083
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:17,498
keep these plants in I feel like we know

2084
01:13:15,670 --> 01:13:19,538
how to feed them we know what's going on

2085
01:13:17,498 --> 01:13:22,090
in the grow now what can we do to these

2086
01:13:19,538 --> 01:13:23,768
plants to increase production what can

2087
01:13:22,090 --> 01:13:25,869
we do to make sure they stay healthy and

2088
01:13:23,769 --> 01:13:28,269
pest free all the way up to the end of

2089
01:13:25,868 --> 01:13:30,578
the flowering cycle one thing we need to

2090
01:13:28,269 --> 01:13:33,849
keep in mind is that we need to be very

2091
01:13:30,578 --> 01:13:36,279
selective on sprays this late in flower

2092
01:13:33,849 --> 01:13:38,800
I would prefer not to spray anything at

2093
01:13:36,279 --> 01:13:40,840
all on these plants but if we do run

2094
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:43,689
into issues there are very limited

2095
01:13:40,840 --> 01:13:46,569
options of products we can use to spray

2096
01:13:43,689 --> 01:13:48,999
on these plants so let's do our best at

2097
01:13:46,569 --> 01:13:51,188
this point to keep bugs out of the grow

2098
01:13:48,998 --> 01:13:53,228
room we should already be implementing

2099
01:13:51,189 --> 01:13:55,539
an integrated pest management system

2100
01:13:53,229 --> 01:13:57,969
which includes a spray rotation and

2101
01:13:55,538 --> 01:14:00,309
possible release of predator bugs

2102
01:13:57,969 --> 01:14:02,260
I would also avoid going to other

2103
01:14:00,309 --> 01:14:04,599
gardens if you have friends that grow I

2104
01:14:02,260 --> 01:14:06,699
would stay away from their grow I would

2105
01:14:04,599 --> 01:14:09,340
also never take anybody else into my

2106
01:14:06,698 --> 01:14:11,288
grow especially other friends that grow

2107
01:14:09,340 --> 01:14:14,019
you are inviting their spider mites

2108
01:14:11,288 --> 01:14:16,328
right into your garden also change

2109
01:14:14,019 --> 01:14:17,679
clothes if you go to another grow if you

2110
01:14:16,328 --> 01:14:19,538
work in a commercial grow and have a

2111
01:14:17,679 --> 01:14:21,429
private grow at home change clothes

2112
01:14:19,538 --> 01:14:23,948
between those grows I would also

2113
01:14:21,429 --> 01:14:25,689
recommend changing clothes between stops

2114
01:14:23,948 --> 01:14:27,488
at the grow store and going to your

2115
01:14:25,689 --> 01:14:29,920
garden don't go straight from the hydro

2116
01:14:27,488 --> 01:14:31,928
shop to your garden you are picking [ __ ]

2117
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:33,699
up at the gross store all day long all

2118
01:14:31,929 --> 01:14:36,038
of the dirty growers are going there all

2119
01:14:33,698 --> 01:14:38,138
the soil is being shipped there that is

2120
01:14:36,038 --> 01:14:39,998
a hotbed for pests

2121
01:14:38,139 --> 01:14:42,189
don't take your pests from the gross

2122
01:14:39,998 --> 01:14:44,859
store right to your garden I would also

2123
01:14:42,189 --> 01:14:47,139
recommend a dedicated pair of shoes for

2124
01:14:44,859 --> 01:14:49,179
the garden or for the grow room if you

2125
01:14:47,139 --> 01:14:51,819
work in multiple facilities I would have

2126
01:14:49,179 --> 01:14:53,078
a pair of shoes for the grow at work

2127
01:14:51,819 --> 01:14:55,090
would have a pair of shoes that I wore

2128
01:14:53,078 --> 01:14:56,920
after work then I would have a different

2129
01:14:55,090 --> 01:14:59,199
pair of shoes that I put on to go in my

2130
01:14:56,920 --> 01:15:01,569
personal garden also if you have an

2131
01:14:59,198 --> 01:15:05,078
outdoor grow and an indoor grow change

2132
01:15:01,569 --> 01:15:07,210
clothes and shoes between those Gardens

2133
01:15:05,078 --> 01:15:09,340
it sounds really tedious and it sounds

2134
01:15:07,210 --> 01:15:11,679
like overkill but we do not want to

2135
01:15:09,340 --> 01:15:14,380
spread spider mites from one Garden to

2136
01:15:11,679 --> 01:15:16,060
another the most obvious and easy way

2137
01:15:14,380 --> 01:15:18,849
for mites to spread is for them to

2138
01:15:16,060 --> 01:15:21,130
travel on a grower so let's do our best

2139
01:15:18,849 --> 01:15:23,590
as responsible growers as responsible

2140
01:15:21,130 --> 01:15:25,840
farmers to not spread spider mites to

2141
01:15:23,590 --> 01:15:28,029
our other grows and to our friends grows

2142
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:30,578
it's pretty easy to get rid of spider

2143
01:15:28,029 --> 01:15:32,078
mites early in flower and veg but it is

2144
01:15:30,578 --> 01:15:34,389
a pain in the ass to get rid of spider

2145
01:15:32,078 --> 01:15:36,698
mites late in bloom so let's not drag

2146
01:15:34,389 --> 01:15:38,380
them into the bloom room if you do have

2147
01:15:36,698 --> 01:15:40,988
multiple rooms or multiple facilities

2148
01:15:38,380 --> 01:15:44,289
and you do find a pest issue in one area

2149
01:15:40,988 --> 01:15:46,689
treat that area as a contaminated space

2150
01:15:44,289 --> 01:15:48,939
notify everybody that works there hey

2151
01:15:46,689 --> 01:15:51,549
there are spider mites in here don't go

2152
01:15:48,939 --> 01:15:53,618
in here unless it is required then if

2153
01:15:51,550 --> 01:15:55,389
you do have to go in that area make sure

2154
01:15:53,618 --> 01:15:57,460
you change clothes before entering

2155
01:15:55,389 --> 01:15:59,020
another grow area and carrying those

2156
01:15:57,460 --> 01:16:01,630
spider mites throughout the facility

2157
01:15:59,020 --> 01:16:03,610
with you if you have one room that is

2158
01:16:01,630 --> 01:16:05,319
not infested with mites and you have

2159
01:16:03,609 --> 01:16:07,689
another room that is infested with mites

2160
01:16:05,319 --> 01:16:09,639
work on the clean room first when you

2161
01:16:07,689 --> 01:16:11,439
get to work do all the work that needs

2162
01:16:09,639 --> 01:16:13,449
to be done in there close that room up

2163
01:16:11,439 --> 01:16:15,638
and be done then go to that spider mite

2164
01:16:13,448 --> 01:16:17,469
room do your work in there and then when

2165
01:16:15,639 --> 01:16:19,989
you're done leave the growth facility

2166
01:16:17,469 --> 01:16:21,460
remove your clothes clean them put them

2167
01:16:19,988 --> 01:16:23,828
in the laundry and don't take those

2168
01:16:21,460 --> 01:16:26,109
dirty clothes back into that clean room

2169
01:16:23,828 --> 01:16:28,179
work on the clean room first

2170
01:16:26,109 --> 01:16:29,679
then work on the dirty rooms last so

2171
01:16:28,179 --> 01:16:32,289
that we don't drag those spider mites

2172
01:16:29,679 --> 01:16:34,210
into the room that is clean and if you

2173
01:16:32,289 --> 01:16:36,429
know that one room is contaminated and

2174
01:16:34,210 --> 01:16:39,130
you have to go in there I would almost

2175
01:16:36,429 --> 01:16:41,618
suggest a lab coat or a Tyvek suit that

2176
01:16:39,130 --> 01:16:43,328
you can swap between rooms if you've got

2177
01:16:41,618 --> 01:16:43,839
to go into the meited room throw on the

2178
01:16:43,328 --> 01:16:45,789
lab coat

2179
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:47,380
throw on the Tyvek suit go into the

2180
01:16:45,789 --> 01:16:49,750
spider matted room do what you need to

2181
01:16:47,380 --> 01:16:52,179
do come out of that room remove the lab

2182
01:16:49,750 --> 01:16:54,639
coat or Tyvek suit replace it with a

2183
01:16:52,179 --> 01:16:56,319
fresh lab coat or Tyvek suit and then go

2184
01:16:54,639 --> 01:16:58,900
into the room that you need to work in

2185
01:16:56,319 --> 01:17:00,158
next again I know this sounds tedious I

2186
01:16:58,899 --> 01:17:03,098
know this sounds like overkill but

2187
01:17:00,158 --> 01:17:05,199
imagine if you've got 500 plants in one

2188
01:17:03,099 --> 01:17:07,029
room and you're expecting to harvest

2189
01:17:05,199 --> 01:17:08,679
over a hundred pounds and we distract

2190
01:17:07,029 --> 01:17:10,689
spider mites into their from the other

2191
01:17:08,680 --> 01:17:12,159
room now we've got one room that is

2192
01:17:10,689 --> 01:17:14,319
almost ready to harvest and we've been

2193
01:17:12,159 --> 01:17:15,789
fighting spider mites almost gone we're

2194
01:17:14,319 --> 01:17:17,679
almost through that battle but guess

2195
01:17:15,789 --> 01:17:19,810
what you just walked into the other room

2196
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:21,430
and we're five weeks into flower and you

2197
01:17:19,810 --> 01:17:23,080
just dropped a spider mite bomb in there

2198
01:17:21,430 --> 01:17:25,690
because you were lazy and didn't bother

2199
01:17:23,079 --> 01:17:27,609
to change your lab coat small problems

2200
01:17:25,689 --> 01:17:29,739
are small problems when they are small

2201
01:17:27,609 --> 01:17:32,139
problems but when we go to a large scale

2202
01:17:29,739 --> 01:17:34,809
cultivation facility a very small

2203
01:17:32,140 --> 01:17:36,880
problem will multiply overnight those

2204
01:17:34,810 --> 01:17:38,230
spider mites are going to have a party

2205
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:39,970
when we turn off the lights and

2206
01:17:38,229 --> 01:17:42,129
everybody goes home you will come in the

2207
01:17:39,970 --> 01:17:44,740
next morning and now it is spider mite

2208
01:17:42,130 --> 01:17:46,270
world so let's do our best to not

2209
01:17:44,739 --> 01:17:48,519
introduce spider mites to the grow

2210
01:17:46,270 --> 01:17:50,200
because we are very limited on plans of

2211
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:52,270
attack to get rid of those mites in this

2212
01:17:50,199 --> 01:17:54,939
point of the game there are very limited

2213
01:17:52,270 --> 01:17:58,240
sprays we can apply one thing we can do

2214
01:17:54,939 --> 01:17:59,559
we can release predator bugs now if you

2215
01:17:58,239 --> 01:18:01,960
were planning ahead part of your

2216
01:17:59,560 --> 01:18:04,570
integrated pest management system did

2217
01:18:01,960 --> 01:18:07,539
include ordering predator bugs to be

2218
01:18:04,569 --> 01:18:10,090
released early in Flour hopefully around

2219
01:18:07,539 --> 01:18:12,279
week 3 you released an army of predator

2220
01:18:10,090 --> 01:18:14,800
bugs so now if any spider mites do show

2221
01:18:12,279 --> 01:18:16,420
up those predators are already colonized

2222
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:18,550
they're already there claiming their

2223
01:18:16,420 --> 01:18:21,069
turf and no spider mites will start

2224
01:18:18,550 --> 01:18:22,630
infesting your grow now if you didn't

2225
01:18:21,069 --> 01:18:25,210
get those predator bugs in there early

2226
01:18:22,630 --> 01:18:27,190
it is not too late to order predators to

2227
01:18:25,210 --> 01:18:29,439
come attack your spider mite infestation

2228
01:18:27,189 --> 01:18:31,449
but you need to act quickly don't say

2229
01:18:29,439 --> 01:18:33,489
I'll order them Monday when you see

2230
01:18:31,449 --> 01:18:36,460
spider mites in the grow order those

2231
01:18:33,489 --> 01:18:38,319
predator mites today when that box of

2232
01:18:36,460 --> 01:18:40,029
predator mites comes you need to stop

2233
01:18:38,319 --> 01:18:42,789
what you were doing and release those

2234
01:18:40,029 --> 01:18:45,009
bugs into the garden immediately we need

2235
01:18:42,789 --> 01:18:47,050
to win the war we need to release our

2236
01:18:45,010 --> 01:18:49,000
troops to get in there and destroy those

2237
01:18:47,050 --> 01:18:50,590
spider mites that are sucking the juices

2238
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:52,479
out of our plants they are destroying

2239
01:18:50,590 --> 01:18:54,489
our potency and they are diminishing our

2240
01:18:52,479 --> 01:18:57,279
yields we need to get rid of them

2241
01:18:54,489 --> 01:18:59,739
immediately so if it's too late to spray

2242
01:18:57,279 --> 01:19:02,500
I highly suggest you order predator bugs

2243
01:18:59,739 --> 01:19:04,269
order more than you think you need we

2244
01:19:02,500 --> 01:19:06,670
want a large army to get in there and

2245
01:19:04,270 --> 01:19:09,430
wipe out the infestation as quickly as

2246
01:19:06,670 --> 01:19:11,230
possible now earlier I did say we are

2247
01:19:09,430 --> 01:19:13,150
very limited on the products we can

2248
01:19:11,229 --> 01:19:15,849
spray to our plants this late in Flour

2249
01:19:13,149 --> 01:19:17,349
there are a few beneficial fungus based

2250
01:19:15,850 --> 01:19:19,119
products that can be applied to the

2251
01:19:17,350 --> 01:19:21,280
plants this late in Flour that

2252
01:19:19,118 --> 01:19:23,109
will not affect the taste if you

2253
01:19:21,279 --> 01:19:26,198
understand the products you were using

2254
01:19:23,109 --> 01:19:28,448
you can apply a sprayed pesticide and

2255
01:19:26,198 --> 01:19:31,299
you can release predators and they will

2256
01:19:28,448 --> 01:19:33,819
work together the proper pesticide at

2257
01:19:31,300 --> 01:19:36,038
this stage of the game will not harm

2258
01:19:33,819 --> 01:19:38,469
your flowers and it will not kill your

2259
01:19:36,038 --> 01:19:41,469
predators again I do not suggest

2260
01:19:38,469 --> 01:19:44,198
spraying plants with bulky flowers but

2261
01:19:41,469 --> 01:19:47,590
sometimes something has to be done we do

2262
01:19:44,198 --> 01:19:50,648
have a few spray application options do

2263
01:19:47,590 --> 01:19:53,378
not spray anything oil-based this late

2264
01:19:50,649 --> 01:19:56,860
in flower it will ruin the flavor and

2265
01:19:53,378 --> 01:19:59,168
aroma of your plants the only things I

2266
01:19:56,859 --> 01:20:02,228
would recommend to spray this late in

2267
01:19:59,168 --> 01:20:05,019
flower would be beneficial fungus type

2268
01:20:02,229 --> 01:20:07,269
products I would never apply an oil this

2269
01:20:05,019 --> 01:20:08,889
late in flower and I don't even want to

2270
01:20:07,269 --> 01:20:10,418
spray them unless it is absolutely

2271
01:20:08,889 --> 01:20:12,309
necessary

2272
01:20:10,418 --> 01:20:14,618
I would rather release the Predators and

2273
01:20:12,309 --> 01:20:16,719
let them do their thing but I understand

2274
01:20:14,618 --> 01:20:17,109
sometimes you're going to go into panic

2275
01:20:16,719 --> 01:20:18,578
mode

2276
01:20:17,109 --> 01:20:20,738
sometimes it's more than what the

2277
01:20:18,578 --> 01:20:22,448
Predators can handle sometimes you may

2278
01:20:20,738 --> 01:20:24,428
have already purchased the pesticide and

2279
01:20:22,448 --> 01:20:27,158
you don't have funding to order insects

2280
01:20:24,429 --> 01:20:29,078
I do understand that things come up in a

2281
01:20:27,158 --> 01:20:31,509
garden and life does happen and we can't

2282
01:20:29,078 --> 01:20:34,268
always control things one thing we can

2283
01:20:31,510 --> 01:20:36,280
do from this situation is take note we

2284
01:20:34,269 --> 01:20:38,530
can try to understand how did we get

2285
01:20:36,279 --> 01:20:40,898
spider mites and how can we prevent this

2286
01:20:38,529 --> 01:20:43,090
from happening next time so it is time

2287
01:20:40,899 --> 01:20:46,479
to stop spraying the plants it is also

2288
01:20:43,090 --> 01:20:48,159
time to stop running the sulfur burner

2289
01:20:46,479 --> 01:20:50,199
if you've got a sulfur burner in your

2290
01:20:48,158 --> 01:20:52,208
grow turn that [ __ ] off it is making

2291
01:20:50,198 --> 01:20:54,998
your plants taste terrible it is making

2292
01:20:52,208 --> 01:20:56,800
your concentrates taste terrible let's

2293
01:20:54,998 --> 01:20:58,898
stop using sulfur burners in the grow

2294
01:20:56,800 --> 01:21:01,090
and let's start correcting the true

2295
01:20:58,899 --> 01:21:03,280
issue what is causing the powdery mildew

2296
01:21:01,090 --> 01:21:05,469
people use sulfur to prevent and cure

2297
01:21:03,279 --> 01:21:07,658
powdery mildew how about we find to the

2298
01:21:05,469 --> 01:21:09,908
cause instead of burning sulfur in the

2299
01:21:07,658 --> 01:21:12,308
room and making the room smell like [ __ ]

2300
01:21:09,908 --> 01:21:13,958
making your bud smell like [ __ ] making

2301
01:21:12,309 --> 01:21:15,820
your concentrate smell like [ __ ] making

2302
01:21:13,958 --> 01:21:17,859
the final product completely tastes like

2303
01:21:15,819 --> 01:21:20,319
[ __ ] let's find out what's causing that

2304
01:21:17,859 --> 01:21:22,628
powdery mildew and cure that instead of

2305
01:21:20,319 --> 01:21:24,340
just burning sulfur in the room now I

2306
01:21:22,628 --> 01:21:26,168
know a lot of people have a sulphur

2307
01:21:24,340 --> 01:21:27,699
burner and that is their method that's

2308
01:21:26,168 --> 01:21:29,769
how they learn that's what they're going

2309
01:21:27,698 --> 01:21:32,388
to do they're not going to stop doing it

2310
01:21:29,769 --> 01:21:34,280
because I said so let's compromise

2311
01:21:32,389 --> 01:21:36,288
you insist on using a sulphur burner in

2312
01:21:34,279 --> 01:21:39,259
your garden perhaps you can stop using

2313
01:21:36,288 --> 01:21:41,630
it around week three or around week four

2314
01:21:39,260 --> 01:21:43,579
when those buds start popping up earlier

2315
01:21:41,630 --> 01:21:45,828
in the episode I suggested reducing

2316
01:21:43,578 --> 01:21:47,719
humidity perhaps reducing that humidity

2317
01:21:45,828 --> 01:21:49,549
a little bit will help prevent that

2318
01:21:47,719 --> 01:21:51,168
powdery mildew since we're getting the

2319
01:21:49,550 --> 01:21:53,208
fat buds we need to reduce humidity

2320
01:21:51,168 --> 01:21:55,488
anyway let's get it a little cooler

2321
01:21:53,208 --> 01:21:57,828
reduce humidity and stop burning that

2322
01:21:55,488 --> 01:21:59,569
sulfur and I'm sure the product will

2323
01:21:57,828 --> 01:22:01,880
taste better if you've ever smoked to

2324
01:21:59,569 --> 01:22:04,398
concentrate the tasted like fish or fish

2325
01:22:01,880 --> 01:22:06,590
oil a lot of the times that is because

2326
01:22:04,399 --> 01:22:09,499
there was a sulphur burner being used in

2327
01:22:06,590 --> 01:22:11,328
the room during the flowering phase so

2328
01:22:09,498 --> 01:22:13,998
no more sprays and no more sulfur

2329
01:22:11,328 --> 01:22:15,889
burners after week three please

2330
01:22:13,998 --> 01:22:18,168
so now that we are approaching week four

2331
01:22:15,889 --> 01:22:20,239
it is time to reduce some of the

2332
01:22:18,168 --> 01:22:22,488
physical stress we have been performing

2333
01:22:20,238 --> 01:22:24,379
to the plant I still want to do some

2334
01:22:22,488 --> 01:22:26,779
popping and twisting and I still want to

2335
01:22:24,380 --> 01:22:29,059
work them into the Nets but I don't want

2336
01:22:26,779 --> 01:22:31,488
to go as hard and as extreme as I was

2337
01:22:29,059 --> 01:22:33,168
before I want to allow these plants to

2338
01:22:31,488 --> 01:22:35,178
use their energy on producing buds now

2339
01:22:33,168 --> 01:22:37,099
and not recovering from all the popping

2340
01:22:35,179 --> 01:22:38,989
and breaking and not being stressed out

2341
01:22:37,099 --> 01:22:40,998
I want them to just focus on making fat

2342
01:22:38,988 --> 01:22:42,948
chunky buds and sweet trichomes for me

2343
01:22:40,998 --> 01:22:44,658
so I'm going to reduce the stress a

2344
01:22:42,948 --> 01:22:46,578
little bit that doesn't mean I'm gonna

2345
01:22:44,658 --> 01:22:48,589
stop beating them up but I am going to

2346
01:22:46,578 --> 01:22:50,808
mellow out just a little bit on these

2347
01:22:48,590 --> 01:22:52,429
girls so we're gonna reduce the stress

2348
01:22:50,809 --> 01:22:54,409
we're gonna do a little less popping and

2349
01:22:52,429 --> 01:22:56,658
twisting but we are still going to pop

2350
01:22:54,408 --> 01:22:58,638
and twist the stems we're also going to

2351
01:22:56,658 --> 01:23:00,438
continue working these plants into the

2352
01:22:58,639 --> 01:23:01,819
trellis if you've got a trellis net and

2353
01:23:00,439 --> 01:23:03,739
you've got a plant that's taken off

2354
01:23:01,819 --> 01:23:05,688
getting too tall don't be afraid to grab

2355
01:23:03,738 --> 01:23:07,998
that one crack the stem and work it

2356
01:23:05,689 --> 01:23:09,918
right back under the net the star of

2357
01:23:07,998 --> 01:23:12,438
week 4 is also a good time to do our

2358
01:23:09,918 --> 01:23:14,090
final bottoming we've got those little

2359
01:23:12,439 --> 01:23:15,979
bud sets showing we know where the buds

2360
01:23:14,090 --> 01:23:17,538
are gonna be if you've got a stick with

2361
01:23:15,979 --> 01:23:19,519
a bunch of little tiny shitty buds on it

2362
01:23:17,538 --> 01:23:21,469
just clean those little popcorn balls

2363
01:23:19,519 --> 01:23:23,179
right on off and leave that stuff at the

2364
01:23:21,469 --> 01:23:25,819
end of the branch to develop into a nice

2365
01:23:23,179 --> 01:23:27,408
chunky bud in a previous episode I

2366
01:23:25,819 --> 01:23:29,658
talked about taking off all those little

2367
01:23:27,408 --> 01:23:31,668
tiny sucker buds you can leave the thick

2368
01:23:29,658 --> 01:23:33,288
branches but those little buds that grow

2369
01:23:31,668 --> 01:23:35,569
off the base of that branch toward the

2370
01:23:33,288 --> 01:23:37,429
bottom those can get cut off if they're

2371
01:23:35,569 --> 01:23:38,808
just a waste of space and energy and

2372
01:23:37,429 --> 01:23:40,880
they're not going to produce anything

2373
01:23:38,809 --> 01:23:42,860
except their pain in the ass you can cut

2374
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:44,449
those right off of the plant some

2375
01:23:42,859 --> 01:23:46,069
growers like to say that's what I was

2376
01:23:44,448 --> 01:23:47,599
going to make concentrate out of that

2377
01:23:46,069 --> 01:23:49,189
I was going to make my edibles out of

2378
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:51,200
that's fine if you want to leave that

2379
01:23:49,189 --> 01:23:53,269
there I feel like if you cut that stuff

2380
01:23:51,199 --> 01:23:54,979
off that doesn't get a lot of light you

2381
01:23:53,270 --> 01:23:56,780
take that energy and you move it right

2382
01:23:54,979 --> 01:23:58,429
up to the top of the plant instead of

2383
01:23:56,779 --> 01:24:00,319
the plant feeding those twelve little

2384
01:23:58,430 --> 01:24:01,610
tiny [ __ ] buds at the bottom it can just

2385
01:24:00,319 --> 01:24:03,439
put that energy right up at the top

2386
01:24:01,609 --> 01:24:05,029
where it's getting light I can use that

2387
01:24:03,439 --> 01:24:07,399
energy to make that top coal of that

2388
01:24:05,029 --> 01:24:09,170
much beefier that much fatter and it

2389
01:24:07,399 --> 01:24:10,399
also sucks to trim that bottom stuff

2390
01:24:09,170 --> 01:24:12,230
nobody wants to trim those little

2391
01:24:10,399 --> 01:24:14,179
popcorn buds nobody wants to waste time

2392
01:24:12,229 --> 01:24:15,589
cutting that off and if you can cut

2393
01:24:14,180 --> 01:24:17,630
something off to make something better

2394
01:24:15,590 --> 01:24:20,000
why wouldn't you do it so now is a good

2395
01:24:17,630 --> 01:24:21,560
time to go do a final bottoming just

2396
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:24,020
clean up that messy crap on the bottom

2397
01:24:21,560 --> 01:24:24,560
that's not going to turn into any usable

2398
01:24:24,020 --> 01:24:26,840
bud

2399
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:30,260
now I also like to do a light

2400
01:24:26,840 --> 01:24:33,050
defoliation at this point any leaf with

2401
01:24:30,260 --> 01:24:34,579
a purple petiole will get taken off at

2402
01:24:33,050 --> 01:24:36,440
this point in time so if you've got a

2403
01:24:34,579 --> 01:24:38,329
big leaf it's got a purple stem you can

2404
01:24:36,439 --> 01:24:39,949
see that long purple stem just go ahead

2405
01:24:38,329 --> 01:24:41,720
and break that off break that stem off

2406
01:24:39,949 --> 01:24:43,399
as close to the branch as close to the

2407
01:24:41,720 --> 01:24:44,810
bud as you can so you don't leave that

2408
01:24:43,399 --> 01:24:47,000
little stand there with moisture hanging

2409
01:24:44,810 --> 01:24:48,710
out just break that stem right off get

2410
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:50,899
those leaves out of the room we don't

2411
01:24:48,710 --> 01:24:52,909
need all the excessive leaves so

2412
01:24:50,899 --> 01:24:54,769
anything with the purple stem I'll go

2413
01:24:52,909 --> 01:24:56,479
kind of light I'll do one layer I'll

2414
01:24:54,770 --> 01:24:57,830
look at the room I'll say yeah I could

2415
01:24:56,479 --> 01:24:59,329
do more and then I'll go back and take

2416
01:24:57,829 --> 01:25:01,069
off more leaves and then I'll stand back

2417
01:24:59,329 --> 01:25:02,899
and look into the room and I just try to

2418
01:25:01,069 --> 01:25:04,340
make sure that I've gotten all the giant

2419
01:25:02,899 --> 01:25:06,859
leaves that are blocking the light from

2420
01:25:04,340 --> 01:25:08,449
hitting the buds if they're if I can see

2421
01:25:06,859 --> 01:25:10,099
light coming down and it's hitting a

2422
01:25:08,449 --> 01:25:12,439
leaf and I can clearly see that that

2423
01:25:10,100 --> 01:25:14,329
leaf is hanging over a bud site I will

2424
01:25:12,439 --> 01:25:16,219
remove that leave so that bud site can

2425
01:25:14,329 --> 01:25:17,720
get the light now a lot of old-school

2426
01:25:16,220 --> 01:25:19,400
growers are going to tell you don't

2427
01:25:17,720 --> 01:25:21,530
remove the leaves because that's where

2428
01:25:19,399 --> 01:25:23,479
the nutrients and sugars are stored but

2429
01:25:21,529 --> 01:25:25,250
I'm pretty sure earlier in this episode

2430
01:25:23,479 --> 01:25:27,409
we talked about feeding these plants a

2431
01:25:25,250 --> 01:25:28,970
whole bunch of nutrients there's not

2432
01:25:27,409 --> 01:25:30,920
really a reason for these plants to

2433
01:25:28,970 --> 01:25:32,300
store nutrients we are feeding the [ __ ]

2434
01:25:30,920 --> 01:25:33,619
out of them these are high performance

2435
01:25:32,300 --> 01:25:35,720
plants that are going to get a high

2436
01:25:33,619 --> 01:25:37,760
performance meal every day they don't

2437
01:25:35,720 --> 01:25:40,220
need that stored stuff we can pull those

2438
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:42,530
leaves off those leaves will give us

2439
01:25:40,220 --> 01:25:44,659
opportunity for powdery mildew those

2440
01:25:42,529 --> 01:25:46,909
leaves are places for pests to hide

2441
01:25:44,659 --> 01:25:49,039
those leaves have to come off when we

2442
01:25:46,909 --> 01:25:51,139
trim anyway why not take those leaves

2443
01:25:49,039 --> 01:25:53,060
off now and save us the trouble

2444
01:25:51,140 --> 01:25:55,550
now don't go extreme and make the plants

2445
01:25:53,060 --> 01:25:56,990
naked take off the leaves with the giant

2446
01:25:55,550 --> 01:25:59,360
pea Deol's and the leaves that are in

2447
01:25:56,989 --> 01:25:59,899
the way this is kind of intimidating for

2448
01:25:59,359 --> 01:26:01,759
new grower

2449
01:25:59,899 --> 01:26:03,289
and honestly this is an art and a skill

2450
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:06,230
that you will have to develop over time

2451
01:26:03,289 --> 01:26:08,300
a good way to practice defoliating and

2452
01:26:06,229 --> 01:26:10,279
seeing what happens to the plants is to

2453
01:26:08,300 --> 01:26:11,869
get four plants of the same thing so

2454
01:26:10,279 --> 01:26:13,429
you've got four clones of let's say

2455
01:26:11,869 --> 01:26:14,960
golden go you got four golden goat

2456
01:26:13,430 --> 01:26:17,000
plants they're all in the same room

2457
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:20,180
they're all in the same environment why

2458
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:22,640
not defoliate one really hard defoliate

2459
01:26:20,180 --> 01:26:24,530
one kind of hard be fully eight one a

2460
01:26:22,640 --> 01:26:26,480
little bit and then don't be fully eight

2461
01:26:24,529 --> 01:26:28,579
the other one at all then take pictures

2462
01:26:26,479 --> 01:26:30,319
if you can then take as many notes as

2463
01:26:28,579 --> 01:26:32,689
you can and then keep an eye on those

2464
01:26:30,319 --> 01:26:35,059
notes and pictures and see which plant

2465
01:26:32,689 --> 01:26:36,919
came out the best did the plant that you

2466
01:26:35,060 --> 01:26:38,480
left alone come out the best did the

2467
01:26:36,920 --> 01:26:40,100
plant that we beat to [ __ ] and almost

2468
01:26:38,479 --> 01:26:41,059
made it naked come out the best or was

2469
01:26:40,100 --> 01:26:44,360
it the one that's right in the middle

2470
01:26:41,060 --> 01:26:46,970
it's going to be strange specific on how

2471
01:26:44,359 --> 01:26:50,119
hard you want to go with defoliation but

2472
01:26:46,970 --> 01:26:52,100
most strains will benefit from a medium

2473
01:26:50,119 --> 01:26:54,439
defoliation and they will definitely

2474
01:26:52,100 --> 01:26:56,420
benefit from removing all those super

2475
01:26:54,439 --> 01:26:59,179
large leaves that are blocking your bud

2476
01:26:56,420 --> 01:27:01,460
sites now if you go too hard your plants

2477
01:26:59,180 --> 01:27:03,890
will look naked and the growth will stop

2478
01:27:01,460 --> 01:27:06,590
you'll just slow them down so don't go

2479
01:27:03,890 --> 01:27:08,570
extremely hard on your first defoliation

2480
01:27:06,590 --> 01:27:10,430
kind of practice going there and pull

2481
01:27:08,569 --> 01:27:12,319
off some leaves I like to say this in

2482
01:27:10,430 --> 01:27:14,300
the podcast all the time you can take

2483
01:27:12,319 --> 01:27:16,969
more off but you can never blow those

2484
01:27:14,300 --> 01:27:19,279
leaves back on so pull a few off take a

2485
01:27:16,970 --> 01:27:21,230
step back look at it see what you think

2486
01:27:19,279 --> 01:27:22,609
if you want to take off more get in

2487
01:27:21,229 --> 01:27:24,799
there and take them off if you're

2488
01:27:22,609 --> 01:27:27,439
intimidated by it leave the leaves there

2489
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:29,779
one thing I will suggest is that if a

2490
01:27:27,439 --> 01:27:32,239
leaf is yellow or funky you remove it

2491
01:27:29,779 --> 01:27:34,519
don't hesitate and don't be shy to take

2492
01:27:32,239 --> 01:27:37,429
down the ugly leaves those need to go

2493
01:27:34,520 --> 01:27:39,530
those yellow leaves are invitations for

2494
01:27:37,430 --> 01:27:41,090
pests a spider mite will see a yellow

2495
01:27:39,529 --> 01:27:43,609
leaf and they will head right to that

2496
01:27:41,090 --> 01:27:45,560
leaf because it is weak the outer layer

2497
01:27:43,609 --> 01:27:47,149
isn't as thick and crunchy so that

2498
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:49,190
spider mite can get it's shitty little

2499
01:27:47,149 --> 01:27:50,599
fangs right through that skin and it can

2500
01:27:49,189 --> 01:27:52,129
get right in there and start sucking the

2501
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:54,680
juice it doesn't have to do with that

2502
01:27:52,130 --> 01:27:56,510
thick healthy plant flesh so get rid of

2503
01:27:54,680 --> 01:27:59,990
those yellow leaves and remove them from

2504
01:27:56,510 --> 01:28:01,610
the garden as soon as possible something

2505
01:27:59,989 --> 01:28:04,159
else I would suggest at this point in

2506
01:28:01,609 --> 01:28:06,049
flowering is to increase air flow it may

2507
01:28:04,159 --> 01:28:07,460
be a good time to add some fans to the

2508
01:28:06,050 --> 01:28:09,710
room if you don't have an oscillating

2509
01:28:07,460 --> 01:28:12,140
fan in the room now is the time we want

2510
01:28:09,710 --> 01:28:13,439
those leaves rustling we don't want

2511
01:28:12,140 --> 01:28:15,900
those buds sitting

2512
01:28:13,439 --> 01:28:17,939
still and letting stagnant air buildup

2513
01:28:15,899 --> 01:28:19,710
in those buds now we don't want the

2514
01:28:17,939 --> 01:28:20,969
plants being bent over and getting [ __ ]

2515
01:28:19,710 --> 01:28:23,069
whipped by the fan all day

2516
01:28:20,969 --> 01:28:24,930
we just want every leaf to rustle

2517
01:28:23,069 --> 01:28:26,789
occasionally you just want that fan to

2518
01:28:24,930 --> 01:28:28,590
pass by and just give those leaves just

2519
01:28:26,789 --> 01:28:31,050
a little rustle just move the air around

2520
01:28:28,590 --> 01:28:33,690
just stir the air just so that nothing

2521
01:28:31,050 --> 01:28:35,219
can get still just move that air I just

2522
01:28:33,689 --> 01:28:37,289
keep doing this motion with my hand like

2523
01:28:35,219 --> 01:28:39,600
you guys can see me just moving that air

2524
01:28:37,289 --> 01:28:41,430
but like I said earlier our buds are

2525
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:43,289
going to start developing they're going

2526
01:28:41,430 --> 01:28:45,180
to start getting fat and chunky those

2527
01:28:43,289 --> 01:28:46,979
buds work like sponges if there's too

2528
01:28:45,180 --> 01:28:48,900
much moisture in the air that moisture

2529
01:28:46,979 --> 01:28:51,149
will get trapped inside those buds then

2530
01:28:48,899 --> 01:28:53,129
we'll start getting bud mold inside the

2531
01:28:51,149 --> 01:28:55,409
but if you've got a fan moving that air

2532
01:28:53,130 --> 01:28:58,199
and moisture around that will reduce the

2533
01:28:55,409 --> 01:29:00,149
opportunities for bud mold now that

2534
01:28:58,198 --> 01:29:02,639
you're adding fans you may need to add

2535
01:29:00,149 --> 01:29:04,349
some sticks or some sort of cages for

2536
01:29:02,640 --> 01:29:06,239
supports if you're not using a trellis

2537
01:29:04,350 --> 01:29:08,670
net your buds are going to start

2538
01:29:06,238 --> 01:29:10,589
toppling over let's not wait till weeks

2539
01:29:08,670 --> 01:29:12,569
five and six when those buds are big and

2540
01:29:10,590 --> 01:29:14,520
chunky and sticky and they're falling

2541
01:29:12,569 --> 01:29:15,420
over trying to break the sticks let's

2542
01:29:14,520 --> 01:29:17,550
get some steaks

2543
01:29:15,420 --> 01:29:19,710
let's get some tomato cages let's start

2544
01:29:17,550 --> 01:29:21,360
supporting these plants early if you've

2545
01:29:19,710 --> 01:29:22,980
got a big long branch and you can tell

2546
01:29:21,359 --> 01:29:25,439
that it's going to turn into a giant bud

2547
01:29:22,979 --> 01:29:27,359
go ahead and stick a long steak into the

2548
01:29:25,439 --> 01:29:29,279
pot stick it into the soil try not to

2549
01:29:27,359 --> 01:29:29,759
cut up too many of the roots it's going

2550
01:29:29,279 --> 01:29:31,529
to happen

2551
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:33,570
I understand but shove that steak

2552
01:29:31,529 --> 01:29:34,738
straight into the soil get that stick

2553
01:29:33,569 --> 01:29:37,829
straight up sticking where you need it

2554
01:29:34,738 --> 01:29:39,988
then use a twisty tie or a zip tie or

2555
01:29:37,829 --> 01:29:42,510
something gentle to just gently attach

2556
01:29:39,988 --> 01:29:44,159
that top police stick to that branch you

2557
01:29:42,510 --> 01:29:45,989
don't want to squeeze that branch at all

2558
01:29:44,159 --> 01:29:48,119
it needs to be loose so that you don't

2559
01:29:45,988 --> 01:29:49,468
pinch that branch you want some freedom

2560
01:29:48,119 --> 01:29:52,319
in there but you don't want it flopping

2561
01:29:49,469 --> 01:29:54,930
around too much don't pinch or crush or

2562
01:29:52,319 --> 01:29:57,269
squeeze the branch at all be very gentle

2563
01:29:54,930 --> 01:29:58,560
so use a few steaks and stick them in

2564
01:29:57,270 --> 01:30:00,449
the dirt and have them sticking straight

2565
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:02,940
up and attach those floppy branches to

2566
01:30:00,448 --> 01:30:04,649
those steaks as needed don't be shy

2567
01:30:02,939 --> 01:30:07,049
I've seen people use a [ __ ] ton of

2568
01:30:04,649 --> 01:30:09,059
steaks in each pot if that's what you've

2569
01:30:07,050 --> 01:30:11,520
got to do that's what you've got to do

2570
01:30:09,060 --> 01:30:13,469
to keep that plant upright so get some

2571
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:15,870
sticks or get some tomato cages and be

2572
01:30:13,469 --> 01:30:18,119
prepared to start supporting your plants

2573
01:30:15,869 --> 01:30:19,559
I hope your buds get so chunky that

2574
01:30:18,119 --> 01:30:21,659
those plants just want to fall right

2575
01:30:19,560 --> 01:30:23,550
over that's what I hope for you but I

2576
01:30:21,659 --> 01:30:25,859
also hope you've got some sticks or a

2577
01:30:23,550 --> 01:30:27,130
tomato cage on hand so that those plants

2578
01:30:25,859 --> 01:30:29,079
don't die when that

2579
01:30:27,130 --> 01:30:30,670
starts happening so we've got some

2580
01:30:29,079 --> 01:30:32,800
airflow we've got some sticks on our

2581
01:30:30,670 --> 01:30:35,800
plants another thing we need to focus on

2582
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:37,810
is to continue scouting for pests and

2583
01:30:35,800 --> 01:30:38,260
p.m. just because we're this late in

2584
01:30:37,810 --> 01:30:40,210
Flour

2585
01:30:38,260 --> 01:30:42,699
doesn't mean that problems can arise

2586
01:30:40,210 --> 01:30:45,429
keep your eyes open for pests and

2587
01:30:42,698 --> 01:30:46,839
powdery mildew and boy try this now

2588
01:30:45,429 --> 01:30:49,149
while we're scouting for pass and boy

2589
01:30:46,840 --> 01:30:51,579
Titus we also need to pay attention to

2590
01:30:49,149 --> 01:30:53,799
plant problems do you see any nutrient

2591
01:30:51,579 --> 01:30:56,050
burn do you see any pH issues pay

2592
01:30:53,800 --> 01:30:58,090
attention to the leaves a few crunchy

2593
01:30:56,050 --> 01:30:59,770
leaves here and there that's acceptable

2594
01:30:58,090 --> 01:31:01,630
a few shitty leaves low in the canopy

2595
01:30:59,770 --> 01:31:03,969
that's acceptable if you start getting

2596
01:31:01,630 --> 01:31:05,949
large clusters of shitty looking leaves

2597
01:31:03,969 --> 01:31:08,020
you've got a problem that needs to be

2598
01:31:05,948 --> 01:31:09,250
addressed hopefully you were taking

2599
01:31:08,020 --> 01:31:10,989
notes of what you've been feeding the

2600
01:31:09,250 --> 01:31:12,698
plants hopefully you've got some kind of

2601
01:31:10,988 --> 01:31:14,649
record of what the pH was that was going

2602
01:31:12,698 --> 01:31:16,988
into the plants and maybe you've even

2603
01:31:14,649 --> 01:31:18,369
been taking notes of what is coming out

2604
01:31:16,988 --> 01:31:21,729
of the plants have you been measuring

2605
01:31:18,369 --> 01:31:23,738
the EC and pH of your runoff if so that

2606
01:31:21,729 --> 01:31:26,439
will help you diagnose problems if a

2607
01:31:23,738 --> 01:31:27,849
problem should arise now while you're

2608
01:31:26,439 --> 01:31:30,189
scouting for pests and while you're

2609
01:31:27,850 --> 01:31:31,840
looking for nutrient issues also don't

2610
01:31:30,189 --> 01:31:33,609
forget about all of the equipment in the

2611
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:35,260
grow room just do some visual

2612
01:31:33,609 --> 01:31:37,839
inspections while you're walking through

2613
01:31:35,260 --> 01:31:40,659
the room listen look you may notice

2614
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:42,670
things always be paying attention to the

2615
01:31:40,658 --> 01:31:44,529
plants and the equipment while you are

2616
01:31:42,670 --> 01:31:47,020
in the grow now while you're looking

2617
01:31:44,529 --> 01:31:48,639
around for equipment problems you're

2618
01:31:47,020 --> 01:31:50,500
looking around for pests and we're also

2619
01:31:48,639 --> 01:31:52,469
looking around for yellow leaves we

2620
01:31:50,500 --> 01:31:54,760
still need to keep our eyes out for

2621
01:31:52,469 --> 01:31:57,039
hermaphrodites if you are growing from

2622
01:31:54,760 --> 01:31:59,409
seed it is still an opportunity to

2623
01:31:57,039 --> 01:32:01,300
reveal hermaphroditic traits this far

2624
01:31:59,408 --> 01:32:04,179
into flower so keep your eyes out for

2625
01:32:01,300 --> 01:32:05,679
firm flowers and I think we've talked a

2626
01:32:04,179 --> 01:32:07,510
little bit in a previous episode about

2627
01:32:05,679 --> 01:32:09,850
what to do if you do discover a

2628
01:32:07,510 --> 01:32:11,619
hermaphroditic plant this late into

2629
01:32:09,850 --> 01:32:13,960
flower you've got several options you

2630
01:32:11,619 --> 01:32:15,729
can pull out the flowers you can cut off

2631
01:32:13,960 --> 01:32:16,149
the main bud that's got the male flowers

2632
01:32:15,729 --> 01:32:18,339
on it

2633
01:32:16,149 --> 01:32:20,198
you can cut down the whole plant or you

2634
01:32:18,340 --> 01:32:21,699
can choose to ignore the immediate

2635
01:32:20,198 --> 01:32:23,589
threat and you can keep an eye on that

2636
01:32:21,698 --> 01:32:25,960
male flower and see if it opens and

2637
01:32:23,590 --> 01:32:27,969
drops pollen just keep in mind that if

2638
01:32:25,960 --> 01:32:30,219
you do see male flowers you do run the

2639
01:32:27,969 --> 01:32:32,230
risk of having pollen in that grow room

2640
01:32:30,219 --> 01:32:34,689
and at this point of flowering those

2641
01:32:32,229 --> 01:32:37,448
female plants are really eager to

2642
01:32:34,689 --> 01:32:39,219
receive that pollen and create seeds so

2643
01:32:37,448 --> 01:32:40,919
keep your eye open because it is not too

2644
01:32:39,219 --> 01:32:43,020
late to find hermaphrodite

2645
01:32:40,920 --> 01:32:44,730
in fact that is always the case keep

2646
01:32:43,020 --> 01:32:47,160
your eyes open through the entire grow

2647
01:32:44,729 --> 01:32:49,259
on your first or second run with the new

2648
01:32:47,159 --> 01:32:51,420
cultivar or if you're growing from seed

2649
01:32:49,260 --> 01:32:52,739
all right podcast world this episode is

2650
01:32:51,420 --> 01:32:54,239
starting to get long so let's start

2651
01:32:52,738 --> 01:32:56,789
recapping and start wrapping up the

2652
01:32:54,238 --> 01:32:58,379
episode let's recap week four and week

2653
01:32:56,789 --> 01:33:00,420
four we are going to continue working

2654
01:32:58,380 --> 01:33:02,520
the plants into the Nets we're going to

2655
01:33:00,420 --> 01:33:04,050
continue popping and twisting we're

2656
01:33:02,520 --> 01:33:06,690
going to bottom the plants a little more

2657
01:33:04,050 --> 01:33:08,699
and now is the time to put on sticks or

2658
01:33:06,689 --> 01:33:10,529
tomato cages we need to reduce the

2659
01:33:08,698 --> 01:33:12,659
stress of the plants and start letting

2660
01:33:10,529 --> 01:33:14,880
the buds develop but we still need to

2661
01:33:12,659 --> 01:33:17,309
work the plants and pop the stems and be

2662
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:19,380
foliate a little bit then we'll work

2663
01:33:17,310 --> 01:33:21,300
into week five that is when we're going

2664
01:33:19,380 --> 01:33:22,890
to do our final bottoming we need to

2665
01:33:21,300 --> 01:33:25,380
finish bottling the plants by the end of

2666
01:33:22,890 --> 01:33:26,820
week five we will do our final popping

2667
01:33:25,380 --> 01:33:29,069
and twisting then we're going to let the

2668
01:33:26,819 --> 01:33:31,799
plants just settle in and develop buds

2669
01:33:29,069 --> 01:33:33,599
we will do our final major defoliation

2670
01:33:31,800 --> 01:33:35,699
we will continue to lightly be fully

2671
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:38,640
through harvest but this is the last big

2672
01:33:35,698 --> 01:33:40,469
defoliation we will do we will also pull

2673
01:33:38,640 --> 01:33:42,660
all of the shitty leaves we'll take off

2674
01:33:40,469 --> 01:33:43,739
all the small popcorn buds any branches

2675
01:33:42,659 --> 01:33:46,019
that don't look like they're worth the

2676
01:33:43,738 --> 01:33:48,059
[ __ ] will get taken out at this time now

2677
01:33:46,020 --> 01:33:49,469
is the last chance to get supports on

2678
01:33:48,060 --> 01:33:51,570
these buds if you don't have some sticks

2679
01:33:49,469 --> 01:33:53,520
or some tomato cages in there now by

2680
01:33:51,569 --> 01:33:55,319
week five you are going to see problems

2681
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:57,300
in week six or plants are going to start

2682
01:33:55,319 --> 01:33:58,679
toppling over so now is the time to get

2683
01:33:57,300 --> 01:34:00,840
in there and make sure you've got sticks

2684
01:33:58,679 --> 01:34:02,940
and some sort of twisty tie or something

2685
01:34:00,840 --> 01:34:05,520
like that holding your buds up it is

2686
01:34:02,939 --> 01:34:07,379
also time to increase air flow we are

2687
01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:09,210
going to start gettin chunky buds so if

2688
01:34:07,380 --> 01:34:11,460
you don't have the air flow moving now

2689
01:34:09,210 --> 01:34:13,560
is the time to do it we also need a

2690
01:34:11,460 --> 01:34:15,719
carbon filter in week four I forgot to

2691
01:34:13,560 --> 01:34:18,179
recap that we need that carbon filter I

2692
01:34:15,719 --> 01:34:20,369
feel like I covered that very well now

2693
01:34:18,179 --> 01:34:22,170
in week six we are going to need that

2694
01:34:20,369 --> 01:34:24,479
air flow you better have those sticks

2695
01:34:22,170 --> 01:34:26,940
and supports done we are done bottoming

2696
01:34:24,479 --> 01:34:29,129
we are done working we are done cracking

2697
01:34:26,939 --> 01:34:31,379
popping and twisting these plants it is

2698
01:34:29,130 --> 01:34:34,230
time to let them grow and let the buds

2699
01:34:31,380 --> 01:34:36,090
get fat stay on top of scouting for

2700
01:34:34,229 --> 01:34:38,069
problems we need to look for bugs we

2701
01:34:36,090 --> 01:34:40,590
need to look for powdery mildew we need

2702
01:34:38,069 --> 01:34:42,139
to look for hermaphrodites we also need

2703
01:34:40,590 --> 01:34:45,480
to pay attention to environmental

2704
01:34:42,140 --> 01:34:47,070
nutrient or pH stresses and if we see

2705
01:34:45,479 --> 01:34:49,889
anything caused by those things we need

2706
01:34:47,069 --> 01:34:52,079
to adjust accordingly now my favorite

2707
01:34:49,890 --> 01:34:54,090
part about weeks five and six this is

2708
01:34:52,079 --> 01:34:54,809
when the good photos happen those buds

2709
01:34:54,090 --> 01:34:56,730
are starting to get

2710
01:34:54,810 --> 01:34:59,070
chunky the buds are nice and fluffy all

2711
01:34:56,729 --> 01:35:00,869
of the pistols are still nice and white

2712
01:34:59,069 --> 01:35:03,509
all the leaves are still lush and green

2713
01:35:00,869 --> 01:35:05,640
now is a great time to start taking

2714
01:35:03,510 --> 01:35:06,570
photos so that is my favorite part of

2715
01:35:05,640 --> 01:35:08,460
week six

2716
01:35:06,569 --> 01:35:09,869
so when week four you got little nugs

2717
01:35:08,460 --> 01:35:11,850
you got those little popcorn balls

2718
01:35:09,869 --> 01:35:13,529
developing then in week five you're

2719
01:35:11,850 --> 01:35:14,970
starting to get actual buds you can see

2720
01:35:13,529 --> 01:35:17,069
the buds growing up the stick they're

2721
01:35:14,970 --> 01:35:19,949
starting to get chunky then in week six

2722
01:35:17,069 --> 01:35:21,539
you actually start developing photogenic

2723
01:35:19,949 --> 01:35:22,949
colas it's time to get in there and

2724
01:35:21,539 --> 01:35:24,329
start taking pictures you're seeing some

2725
01:35:22,949 --> 01:35:26,519
beef you're starting to get some good

2726
01:35:24,329 --> 01:35:28,680
colors the trichomes are coming in week

2727
01:35:26,520 --> 01:35:31,440
six is when it really starts getting

2728
01:35:28,680 --> 01:35:33,750
exciting now the thing to think about is

2729
01:35:31,439 --> 01:35:36,059
keeping these plants healthy pest free

2730
01:35:33,750 --> 01:35:38,760
problem free all the way till the end

2731
01:35:36,060 --> 01:35:41,039
keep yourself out of trouble don't brag

2732
01:35:38,760 --> 01:35:42,750
don't start posting photos just yet if

2733
01:35:41,039 --> 01:35:45,239
you do take a sweet-ass photo in week

2734
01:35:42,750 --> 01:35:47,189
six I suggest you save it until harvest

2735
01:35:45,239 --> 01:35:49,829
then start flooding the pictures out

2736
01:35:47,189 --> 01:35:51,359
after harvest that way nobody knows when

2737
01:35:49,829 --> 01:35:52,859
you're cutting down your crop that's

2738
01:35:51,359 --> 01:35:55,139
just kind of a wheat grower trick from

2739
01:35:52,859 --> 01:35:57,659
back in the day another thing to start

2740
01:35:55,140 --> 01:35:59,579
thinking about is is the next run ready

2741
01:35:57,659 --> 01:36:01,500
we're going to harvest these plants in

2742
01:35:59,579 --> 01:36:03,899
two to four weeks depending on your

2743
01:36:01,500 --> 01:36:06,239
strain do you have plants lined up for

2744
01:36:03,899 --> 01:36:08,159
the next run do you have clones that are

2745
01:36:06,239 --> 01:36:10,590
getting rooted have you ordered seeds

2746
01:36:08,159 --> 01:36:12,479
are you prepared for the next run we

2747
01:36:10,590 --> 01:36:14,850
don't want to miss any time so let's get

2748
01:36:12,479 --> 01:36:16,439

2749
01:36:14,850 --> 01:36:18,030
great opportunity to pitch my seed

2824
01:39:18,510 --> 01:39:21,600
taking dabs of goat power ambrosia

2825
01:39:21,090 --> 01:39:24,300
from our

2826
01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:26,039
and apothecary farms this smells just

2827
01:39:24,300 --> 01:39:27,960
like golden goat it tastes just like

2828
01:39:26,039 --> 01:39:30,510
golden goat and it has got that sativa

2829
01:39:27,960 --> 01:39:32,159
punch that golden goat brings and I love

2830
01:39:30,510 --> 01:39:33,960
it I've always been a big fan of golden

2831
01:39:32,159 --> 01:39:36,180
goat so this is a delicious concentrate

2832
01:39:33,960 --> 01:39:38,730
the label says it is seventy four point

2833
01:39:36,180 --> 01:39:40,230
eight percent THC with a total of eighty

2834
01:39:38,729 --> 01:39:42,329
six point four percent total

2835
01:39:40,229 --> 01:39:44,279
cannabinoids I really like smoking the

2836
01:39:42,329 --> 01:39:45,510
goat power it gets my brain fired up and

2837
01:39:44,279 --> 01:39:48,090
it tastes amazing

2838
01:39:45,510 --> 01:39:49,079
so that is a quality concentrate ladies

2839
01:39:48,090 --> 01:39:50,789
and gentlemen this is going to be

2840
01:39:49,079 --> 01:39:52,260
another grow lesson if you've been

2841
01:39:50,789 --> 01:39:54,539
following along you know I've been doing

2842
01:39:52,260 --> 01:39:56,579
a long series of grow lessons in this

2843
01:39:54,539 --> 01:39:58,529
lesson we are going to do week seven

2844
01:39:56,579 --> 01:40:00,269
through nine we are wrapping up the grow

2845
01:39:58,529 --> 01:40:01,590
it's almost time to harvest so we're

2846
01:40:00,270 --> 01:40:03,060
gonna talk about the final weeks of

2847
01:40:01,590 --> 01:40:04,650
flowering we'll work our way into

2848
01:40:03,060 --> 01:40:07,020
Flushing and a little bit of defoliation

2849
01:40:04,649 --> 01:40:09,359
if you haven't been following along I

2850
01:40:07,020 --> 01:40:11,250
recommend you go back to episode 351 and

2851
01:40:09,359 --> 01:40:13,079
start listening to the grow less ins if

2852
01:40:11,250 --> 01:40:14,579
you are an experienced grower or if

2853
01:40:13,079 --> 01:40:16,319
you've been following along or if you

2854
01:40:14,579 --> 01:40:19,680
feel like you were up to speed let's

2855
01:40:16,319 --> 01:40:21,269
jump right into this Gro lesson at this

2856
01:40:19,680 --> 01:40:23,300
stage of the flowering cycle we are

2857
01:40:21,270 --> 01:40:25,680
entering what I call the third trimester

2858
01:40:23,300 --> 01:40:27,720
most of our plants are going to take

2859
01:40:25,680 --> 01:40:30,030
between eight and ten weeks to flower I

2860
01:40:27,720 --> 01:40:32,340
think nine weeks is a good template to

2861
01:40:30,029 --> 01:40:34,380
set up these grow lessons if your plants

2862
01:40:32,340 --> 01:40:37,350
are going to take more than nine weeks

2863
01:40:34,380 --> 01:40:40,170
I suggest you extend my advice for week

2864
01:40:37,350 --> 01:40:42,570
seven one more week just repeat the week

2865
01:40:40,170 --> 01:40:44,760
seven feeding the temperature the

2866
01:40:42,569 --> 01:40:46,710
humidity just repeat week seven one more

2867
01:40:44,760 --> 01:40:48,720
time if you've got a longer flowering

2868
01:40:46,710 --> 01:40:50,550
cultivar now I understand if you're

2869
01:40:48,720 --> 01:40:51,930
growing from seed you may not know how

2870
01:40:50,550 --> 01:40:53,489
long your plants are going to take to

2871
01:40:51,930 --> 01:40:55,230
flower you're going to have to pay

2872
01:40:53,489 --> 01:40:57,449
attention to the trichomes you're going

2873
01:40:55,229 --> 01:40:59,789
to have to be prepared to flush about 10

2874
01:40:57,449 --> 01:41:01,710
or 14 days before harvest this is going

2875
01:40:59,789 --> 01:41:04,470
to take a close eye you need to pay

2876
01:41:01,710 --> 01:41:06,180
attention to your trichomes often times

2877
01:41:04,470 --> 01:41:07,980
when I'm running seeds that are brand

2878
01:41:06,180 --> 01:41:10,560
new and I don't know what to expect

2879
01:41:07,979 --> 01:41:12,809
I already decided they're going 70 days

2880
01:41:10,560 --> 01:41:15,690
I want to let them flower 70 days and

2881
01:41:12,810 --> 01:41:17,580
see what they give me if I decide 70

2882
01:41:15,689 --> 01:41:19,529
days was too long I can run them less

2883
01:41:17,579 --> 01:41:21,479
time next time but I like to give them

2884
01:41:19,529 --> 01:41:23,519
the opportunity to show me what could

2885
01:41:21,479 --> 01:41:25,829
happen if I go a little bit too long

2886
01:41:23,520 --> 01:41:27,960
some plants really like to bulk up that

2887
01:41:25,829 --> 01:41:30,239
last week some plants really put on some

2888
01:41:27,960 --> 01:41:31,680
extra trichomes that final week some

2889
01:41:30,239 --> 01:41:33,960
plants really don't do [ __ ] for that

2890
01:41:31,680 --> 01:41:34,739
last week except over ripen you're going

2891
01:41:33,960 --> 01:41:37,828
to have to learn

2892
01:41:34,738 --> 01:41:39,569
your specific cultivar in most cases you

2893
01:41:37,828 --> 01:41:42,058
will discover that nine weeks is just

2894
01:41:39,569 --> 01:41:43,590
about right for most plants some will

2895
01:41:42,059 --> 01:41:45,659
take ten weeks if you want to get them

2896
01:41:43,590 --> 01:41:47,248
perfect some already in eight weeks

2897
01:41:45,658 --> 01:41:49,408
which is really advantageous because

2898
01:41:47,248 --> 01:41:51,300
that puts us a week ahead we can produce

2899
01:41:49,408 --> 01:41:53,518
another crop in a commercial environment

2900
01:41:51,300 --> 01:41:55,440
that really helps out but for these

2901
01:41:53,519 --> 01:41:58,860
lessons we are going to focus on a nine

2902
01:41:55,439 --> 01:42:01,109
week cultivar so we are now at the start

2903
01:41:58,859 --> 01:42:02,729
of week seven in our flowering phase at

2904
01:42:01,109 --> 01:42:04,738
this point the buds are starting to get

2905
01:42:02,729 --> 01:42:06,299
really fat they should be getting really

2906
01:42:04,738 --> 01:42:08,549
sticky they should be putting off some

2907
01:42:06,300 --> 01:42:10,679
very nice aromas by now they may be

2908
01:42:08,550 --> 01:42:13,409
starting to make some very nice colors

2909
01:42:10,679 --> 01:42:15,090
if you are growing from seed different

2910
01:42:13,408 --> 01:42:16,799
phenotypes will start becoming very

2911
01:42:15,090 --> 01:42:19,199
obvious at this point in the flowering

2912
01:42:16,800 --> 01:42:20,610
stage you may have one phenotype that

2913
01:42:19,198 --> 01:42:22,469
has gotten way taller you may have a

2914
01:42:20,609 --> 01:42:24,598
phenotype that has stayed shorter you

2915
01:42:22,469 --> 01:42:26,309
may have one that is way branch here you

2916
01:42:24,599 --> 01:42:26,730
will really start seeing the different

2917
01:42:26,309 --> 01:42:29,099
traits

2918
01:42:26,729 --> 01:42:31,078
now that we are later in flower so week

2919
01:42:29,099 --> 01:42:32,730
seven is what I call the fill week the

2920
01:42:31,078 --> 01:42:33,899
buds will really start filling in the

2921
01:42:32,729 --> 01:42:36,448
trichomes will really started getting

2922
01:42:33,899 --> 01:42:38,518
dense this is when the photos really

2923
01:42:36,448 --> 01:42:40,649
start getting hot I think weeks six

2924
01:42:38,519 --> 01:42:42,719
through nine are great for photos it

2925
01:42:40,649 --> 01:42:44,549
only gets better as we go on until it is

2926
01:42:42,719 --> 01:42:46,170
time for harvest so get out your camera

2927
01:42:44,550 --> 01:42:48,360
and take some great photos you're gonna

2928
01:42:46,170 --> 01:42:50,130
get good beefy buds you're gonna get

2929
01:42:48,359 --> 01:42:51,420
good trichome development and soon

2930
01:42:50,130 --> 01:42:54,690
you're going to start getting those

2931
01:42:51,420 --> 01:42:56,788
sweet fall colors now let's focus in on

2932
01:42:54,689 --> 01:42:59,279
the environmental conditions for our

2933
01:42:56,788 --> 01:43:01,679
grow room in week seven of flower our

2934
01:42:59,279 --> 01:43:03,658
buds are getting big and beefy so we

2935
01:43:01,679 --> 01:43:05,460
need to reduce the humidity if we have

2936
01:43:03,658 --> 01:43:07,319
too much humidity in the room we do run

2937
01:43:05,460 --> 01:43:09,538
the risk of bud rot we run the risk of

2938
01:43:07,319 --> 01:43:11,009
powdery mildew so let's reduce the

2939
01:43:09,538 --> 01:43:12,929
humidity let's bring it down to around

2940
01:43:11,010 --> 01:43:15,269
thirty or forty percent relative

2941
01:43:12,929 --> 01:43:18,300
humidity in the room this will help us

2942
01:43:15,269 --> 01:43:19,710
reduce the risk of bud rot so the first

2943
01:43:18,300 --> 01:43:22,139
change is that we should reduce the

2944
01:43:19,710 --> 01:43:23,908
humidity by five to ten percent if

2945
01:43:22,139 --> 01:43:25,828
possible the next thing I would

2946
01:43:23,908 --> 01:43:29,219
recommend is to reduce the temperature

2947
01:43:25,828 --> 01:43:30,569
by just a few degrees if possible we

2948
01:43:29,219 --> 01:43:32,248
have been running our flowering room

2949
01:43:30,569 --> 01:43:34,259
somewhere between 70 and 80 degrees

2950
01:43:32,248 --> 01:43:36,479
during the day I would like to knock

2951
01:43:34,260 --> 01:43:40,050
that down just three to five degrees if

2952
01:43:36,479 --> 01:43:42,238
possible let's try to get it 77 to 75

2953
01:43:40,050 --> 01:43:44,340
degrees in there and as the week's go on

2954
01:43:42,238 --> 01:43:47,279
I would like to reduce it about 3 to 5

2955
01:43:44,340 --> 01:43:48,279
degrees every week until harvest so this

2956
01:43:47,279 --> 01:43:50,139
week let's draw

2957
01:43:48,279 --> 01:43:52,960
down by three degrees if you're already

2958
01:43:50,140 --> 01:43:54,940
at 80 degrees let's get it down to 77 if

2959
01:43:52,960 --> 01:43:58,000
you're down at 77 let's crank it down

2960
01:43:54,939 --> 01:43:59,829
about 75 let's make these plants think

2961
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:01,630
that winter is coming that colder

2962
01:43:59,829 --> 01:44:03,369
environment will bring out more colors

2963
01:44:01,630 --> 01:44:05,319
that colder environment will bring out

2964
01:44:03,369 --> 01:44:07,090
more terpenes that colder environment

2965
01:44:05,319 --> 01:44:08,649
will make your buds more dense and I

2966
01:44:07,090 --> 01:44:10,900
feel like it also speeds up the

2967
01:44:08,649 --> 01:44:12,969
finishing time of our plants so let's

2968
01:44:10,899 --> 01:44:14,920
make it just a little bit colder during

2969
01:44:12,970 --> 01:44:17,590
week 7 now let's talk about our

2970
01:44:14,920 --> 01:44:20,079
nutrients for week 7 this is going to be

2971
01:44:17,590 --> 01:44:22,510
our last opportunity for feeding our

2972
01:44:20,079 --> 01:44:24,579
plants we can start reducing our base

2973
01:44:22,510 --> 01:44:26,650
nutrients we don't need as much nitrogen

2974
01:44:24,579 --> 01:44:27,189
phosphorus and potassium as we have in

2975
01:44:26,649 --> 01:44:29,529
the past

2976
01:44:27,189 --> 01:44:31,779
you can almost eliminate the nitrogen at

2977
01:44:29,529 --> 01:44:33,399
this phase of flowering we don't want to

2978
01:44:31,779 --> 01:44:35,079
overfeed them but we do want to make

2979
01:44:33,399 --> 01:44:36,879
sure that they get a nice boost for

2980
01:44:35,079 --> 01:44:38,199
their last feeding so make sure you

2981
01:44:36,880 --> 01:44:40,569
include some phosphorous and potassium

2982
01:44:38,199 --> 01:44:42,699
to make those buds swell I would also

2983
01:44:40,569 --> 01:44:44,229
include some cal-mag don't go too hard

2984
01:44:42,699 --> 01:44:45,729
on the cal mag at this point because it

2985
01:44:44,229 --> 01:44:48,069
is really hard to flush it out and you

2986
01:44:45,729 --> 01:44:49,959
may taste it if you go too hard with cal

2987
01:44:48,069 --> 01:44:51,969
mag at this point I would always

2988
01:44:49,960 --> 01:44:53,859
encourage a kelp product this late in

2989
01:44:51,970 --> 01:44:56,590
Flour that will add to your flavors and

2990
01:44:53,859 --> 01:44:58,449
aromas I do like an enzymatic product

2991
01:44:56,590 --> 01:45:01,360
this late in Flour because it keeps my

2992
01:44:58,449 --> 01:45:03,279
root zone healthy I also use a microbe

2993
01:45:01,359 --> 01:45:05,019
product this leigh-anne flower I have

2994
01:45:03,279 --> 01:45:06,909
mentioned that we should taper off the

2995
01:45:05,020 --> 01:45:09,460
microbes and start increasing the bloom

2996
01:45:06,909 --> 01:45:11,920
boosters but if your budget will allow I

2997
01:45:09,460 --> 01:45:14,260
would include microbe products this late

2998
01:45:11,920 --> 01:45:17,079
in flower now the thing to focus on on

2999
01:45:14,260 --> 01:45:18,820
this feeding is one final bloom booster

3000
01:45:17,079 --> 01:45:20,739
feeding I don't know what product you're

3001
01:45:18,819 --> 01:45:23,319
using is a bloom booster but this is

3002
01:45:20,739 --> 01:45:25,029
probably your last opportunity to add

3003
01:45:23,319 --> 01:45:26,529
that bloom booster to your nutrient

3004
01:45:25,029 --> 01:45:27,969
regimen so make sure you get that in

3005
01:45:26,529 --> 01:45:31,149
there at this feeding time this is the

3006
01:45:27,970 --> 01:45:32,860
last week to fertilize our plants next

3007
01:45:31,149 --> 01:45:34,809
week we are going to begin the flushing

3008
01:45:32,859 --> 01:45:36,609
phase so if you want to boost those

3009
01:45:34,810 --> 01:45:38,440
plants up one last time if you've been

3010
01:45:36,609 --> 01:45:39,849
saving one bottle of something or one

3011
01:45:38,439 --> 01:45:41,829
little scoop of something this is the

3012
01:45:39,850 --> 01:45:44,110
last time to fertilize those plants

3013
01:45:41,829 --> 01:45:47,529
because at the start of week 8 we are

3014
01:45:44,109 --> 01:45:49,269
going to begin the flush phase now at

3015
01:45:47,529 --> 01:45:51,159
this point in the game we've got big fat

3016
01:45:49,270 --> 01:45:53,710
chunky buds I shouldn't have to say this

3017
01:45:51,159 --> 01:45:56,170
but I want to remind everybody it is too

3018
01:45:53,710 --> 01:45:58,569
late to spray any pesticides on these

3019
01:45:56,170 --> 01:46:00,489
plants they are coming down in 21 days

3020
01:45:58,569 --> 01:46:02,079
we don't want the plants to taste like

3021
01:46:00,489 --> 01:46:04,689
anything we apply it as a pest

3022
01:46:02,079 --> 01:46:07,779
side so please do not spray your plants

3023
01:46:04,689 --> 01:46:09,460
also do not use a sulfur burner I've

3024
01:46:07,779 --> 01:46:11,559
mentioned that in previous episodes

3025
01:46:09,460 --> 01:46:13,480
using a sulfur burner at this point in

3026
01:46:11,560 --> 01:46:16,060
flower will make your plants taste like

3027
01:46:13,479 --> 01:46:18,009
total [ __ ] it will taste like smoking a

3028
01:46:16,060 --> 01:46:20,860
pack of matches or it will taste like

3029
01:46:18,010 --> 01:46:22,690
smoking a can of fish so please turn off

3030
01:46:20,859 --> 01:46:24,039
the sulfur burner and flower I wish

3031
01:46:22,689 --> 01:46:25,509
everybody would just get rid of the

3032
01:46:24,039 --> 01:46:27,640
sulfur burner and find out what is

3033
01:46:25,510 --> 01:46:30,880
actually causing the problem and cure

3034
01:46:27,640 --> 01:46:32,650
the problem so no pesticides no so four

3035
01:46:30,880 --> 01:46:34,989
burners this latent flower what is

3036
01:46:32,649 --> 01:46:37,420
acceptable is predator bugs if you have

3037
01:46:34,989 --> 01:46:39,250
got a pest issue release an excessive

3038
01:46:37,420 --> 01:46:40,720
amount of predator bugs hopefully you've

3039
01:46:39,250 --> 01:46:42,880
been on top of that hopefully you don't

3040
01:46:40,720 --> 01:46:45,670
have a problem but I understand [ __ ]

3041
01:46:42,880 --> 01:46:47,800
happens in cultivation so predator bugs

3042
01:46:45,670 --> 01:46:50,050
are the way to go at this stage of the

3043
01:46:47,800 --> 01:46:51,699
game the little sachets that you hang

3044
01:46:50,050 --> 01:46:53,380
the little teabag look of things it's

3045
01:46:51,699 --> 01:46:55,569
too late for those you need the live

3046
01:46:53,380 --> 01:46:56,949
predators that are ready to release that

3047
01:46:55,569 --> 01:46:58,840
are hungry that are ready to get in

3048
01:46:56,949 --> 01:47:00,639
there and destroy your spider mites or

3049
01:46:58,840 --> 01:47:02,350
whatever pests you may have acquired you

3050
01:47:00,640 --> 01:47:03,910
need the live active bugs they're a

3051
01:47:02,350 --> 01:47:05,980
little more expensive but they are the

3052
01:47:03,909 --> 01:47:08,529
only thing that are effective at this

3053
01:47:05,979 --> 01:47:10,449
stage of flower so again do not spray

3054
01:47:08,529 --> 01:47:13,119
anything do not use a sulfur burner and

3055
01:47:10,449 --> 01:47:14,710
if you do see any insects any pests get

3056
01:47:13,119 --> 01:47:16,809
in there with some predator bugs and

3057
01:47:14,710 --> 01:47:19,329
hopefully those predators will eradicate

3058
01:47:16,810 --> 01:47:22,000
your infestation another thing you can

3059
01:47:19,329 --> 01:47:24,970
do is defoliate if you do see any signs

3060
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:26,170
of pests remove any infested leaves mark

3061
01:47:24,970 --> 01:47:27,850
the plants so that you know where that

3062
01:47:26,170 --> 01:47:30,039
infestation was and come check

3063
01:47:27,850 --> 01:47:33,010
frequently do what you can to minimize

3064
01:47:30,039 --> 01:47:35,289
the problem in that area at this point

3065
01:47:33,010 --> 01:47:38,079
in the game I also suggest you defoliate

3066
01:47:35,289 --> 01:47:39,670
any yellow or funky leaves any leaves

3067
01:47:38,079 --> 01:47:41,859
that look unhealthy are pests

3068
01:47:39,670 --> 01:47:43,930
attractants so get those dead funky

3069
01:47:41,859 --> 01:47:45,849
leaves out of the grow defoliate

3070
01:47:43,930 --> 01:47:47,710
anything that is obvious that needs to

3071
01:47:45,850 --> 01:47:48,940
come off if you've got some nice fall

3072
01:47:47,710 --> 01:47:50,470
looking colors and you want to leave

3073
01:47:48,939 --> 01:47:52,089
those pretty leaves on there for photos

3074
01:47:50,470 --> 01:47:54,310
you can do that but the minute it starts

3075
01:47:52,090 --> 01:47:56,500
getting crunchy and it is dead decaying

3076
01:47:54,310 --> 01:47:58,960
matter it needs to come off of the plant

3077
01:47:56,500 --> 01:48:00,399
it is okay to have a few dead leaves at

3078
01:47:58,960 --> 01:48:02,199
this point in the game we've got a full

3079
01:48:00,399 --> 01:48:04,149
grow we've got a full canopy we've got a

3080
01:48:02,199 --> 01:48:05,590
lot of space there will be some dead

3081
01:48:04,149 --> 01:48:07,269
funky leaves in the garden

3082
01:48:05,590 --> 01:48:09,159
sometimes a leaf just doesn't get enough

3083
01:48:07,270 --> 01:48:10,750
light sometimes a branch gets bumped

3084
01:48:09,159 --> 01:48:13,000
things will happen you will have some

3085
01:48:10,750 --> 01:48:14,800
funky leaves don't freak out if it is

3086
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,969
excessive you may have a problem that

3087
01:48:14,800 --> 01:48:18,039
needs to be diagnosed

3088
01:48:15,969 --> 01:48:20,439
but a few funky leaves at this stage are

3089
01:48:18,039 --> 01:48:22,090
not a problem now another thing we

3090
01:48:20,439 --> 01:48:24,029
should keep our eyes open for at this

3091
01:48:22,090 --> 01:48:26,770
stage of the game are late flower

3092
01:48:24,029 --> 01:48:28,809
hermaphrodites you should be scouting

3093
01:48:26,770 --> 01:48:30,630
daily for pests you should be scouting

3094
01:48:28,810 --> 01:48:33,430
daily for powdery mildew and botrytis

3095
01:48:30,630 --> 01:48:35,920
during that visual inspection you should

3096
01:48:33,430 --> 01:48:37,810
also be looking for hermaphrodites look

3097
01:48:35,920 --> 01:48:39,100
at the top buds of the plants look at

3098
01:48:37,810 --> 01:48:40,930
the middle buds of the plants and

3099
01:48:39,100 --> 01:48:42,489
definitely look at the lower part of the

3100
01:48:40,930 --> 01:48:46,329
plant where you are not getting a lot of

3101
01:48:42,488 --> 01:48:48,549
light do you see any male flowers do you

3102
01:48:46,329 --> 01:48:50,920
know what a male flower looks like could

3103
01:48:48,550 --> 01:48:52,960
you identify a hermaphrodite flower if

3104
01:48:50,920 --> 01:48:55,480
it walked up and bit you on the nose if

3105
01:48:52,960 --> 01:48:57,039
not I recommend you do a little bit of

3106
01:48:55,479 --> 01:48:59,019
google research and know what a

3107
01:48:57,039 --> 01:49:01,090
hermaphrodite flower looks like so you

3108
01:48:59,020 --> 01:49:03,310
do not allow them to happen in your

3109
01:49:01,090 --> 01:49:04,869
garden so at this point of the game we

3110
01:49:03,310 --> 01:49:07,180
still need to keep our eyes open for

3111
01:49:04,869 --> 01:49:09,640
pests and mold problems and we also need

3112
01:49:07,180 --> 01:49:11,409
to keep an eye out for hermaphrodites

3113
01:49:09,640 --> 01:49:13,869
now I've spoken in a previous episode

3114
01:49:11,409 --> 01:49:16,448
about how to handle the Herms if you

3115
01:49:13,869 --> 01:49:18,760
should get one don't freak out don't go

3116
01:49:16,448 --> 01:49:20,109
crazy spray it with some water and think

3117
01:49:18,760 --> 01:49:22,090
of your options do you want to remove

3118
01:49:20,109 --> 01:49:23,859
the male flower do you want to remove

3119
01:49:22,090 --> 01:49:25,119
the bud do you want to remove the branch

3120
01:49:23,859 --> 01:49:27,789
or do you want to get rid of that whole

3121
01:49:25,119 --> 01:49:28,960
plant it is up to you it is your garden

3122
01:49:27,789 --> 01:49:31,269
you're going to have to make decisions

3123
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:33,069
like that if there is just one little

3124
01:49:31,270 --> 01:49:35,110
hermaphrodite flower I would spray it

3125
01:49:33,069 --> 01:49:36,609
with water pick it out with tweezers if

3126
01:49:35,109 --> 01:49:38,589
you've got two or three that are on one

3127
01:49:36,609 --> 01:49:40,689
bud maybe cut that butter that branch

3128
01:49:38,590 --> 01:49:42,430
off if you've got several hermaphrodite

3129
01:49:40,689 --> 01:49:44,259
flowers popping up in different spots on

3130
01:49:42,430 --> 01:49:44,980
a plant it may be time to get rid of

3131
01:49:44,260 --> 01:49:46,659
that plant

3132
01:49:44,979 --> 01:49:48,819
you have a lot of things to think about

3133
01:49:46,659 --> 01:49:51,010
because this lay in flower will those

3134
01:49:48,819 --> 01:49:52,899
male flowers do anything to the rest of

3135
01:49:51,010 --> 01:49:54,969
your crop if you're just running one

3136
01:49:52,899 --> 01:49:57,549
flowering cycle you're probably too late

3137
01:49:54,969 --> 01:49:59,560
into the grow to seed anything if you've

3138
01:49:57,550 --> 01:50:01,630
got a perpetual cycle going on those

3139
01:49:59,560 --> 01:50:03,640
plants that are earlier and flower may

3140
01:50:01,630 --> 01:50:05,590
be ready to receive that pollen should

3141
01:50:03,640 --> 01:50:07,510
that hermaphrodite release pollen so

3142
01:50:05,590 --> 01:50:09,520
you've got things to think about now if

3143
01:50:07,510 --> 01:50:11,530
you do have hermaphroditic plant in your

3144
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:12,190
grow room don't give clones of that to

3145
01:50:11,529 --> 01:50:13,988
anybody

3146
01:50:12,189 --> 01:50:15,879
please don't pass out hermaphrodite

3147
01:50:13,988 --> 01:50:17,589
clones to your friends if you want to

3148
01:50:15,880 --> 01:50:19,600
continue to grow it that is fine but

3149
01:50:17,590 --> 01:50:20,890
don't give our amount to anybody you're

3150
01:50:19,600 --> 01:50:22,630
setting them up for failure

3151
01:50:20,890 --> 01:50:24,880
we don't want to do that to our friends

3152
01:50:22,630 --> 01:50:26,980
and fellow growers now the last things I

3153
01:50:24,880 --> 01:50:29,289
have written down for week 7 is plenty

3154
01:50:26,979 --> 01:50:30,819
of airflow we need a lot of airflow

3155
01:50:29,289 --> 01:50:33,579
the grow room as these buds start

3156
01:50:30,819 --> 01:50:35,409
getting chunkier we may need more fans I

3157
01:50:33,579 --> 01:50:37,029
want to see every leaf move

3158
01:50:35,409 --> 01:50:39,130
I don't need every plant and every leaf

3159
01:50:37,029 --> 01:50:40,899
getting beat down by the wind but I want

3160
01:50:39,130 --> 01:50:43,180
every leaf just to get a little rustle

3161
01:50:40,899 --> 01:50:45,519
occasionally as the fans oscillate I

3162
01:50:43,180 --> 01:50:47,079
want every fan to just feel that fresh

3163
01:50:45,520 --> 01:50:48,550
air just change that air around my

3164
01:50:47,079 --> 01:50:50,199
leaves that way I know the environment

3165
01:50:48,550 --> 01:50:52,119
is getting shuffled we don't have a

3166
01:50:50,199 --> 01:50:53,859
bunch of co2 in one area we don't have a

3167
01:50:52,119 --> 01:50:55,930
bunch of humidity packed up over here I

3168
01:50:53,859 --> 01:50:57,969
want to mix that air all day long and

3169
01:50:55,930 --> 01:51:00,130
keep that air fresh for my plants so

3170
01:50:57,970 --> 01:51:02,949
have plenty of airflow in your grow as

3171
01:51:00,130 --> 01:51:04,390
we get late into flower now the next

3172
01:51:02,949 --> 01:51:07,119
thing I want to talk about is kind of

3173
01:51:04,390 --> 01:51:09,550
preparing us for the future we plan to

3174
01:51:07,119 --> 01:51:12,069
cut this crop down in approximately 21

3175
01:51:09,550 --> 01:51:15,010
days do you have seeds or clones

3176
01:51:12,069 --> 01:51:17,439
prepared for your next run if you have

3177
01:51:15,010 --> 01:51:19,720
another grow space now is the time to

3178
01:51:17,439 --> 01:51:21,609
get your seeds or clones prepared for

3179
01:51:19,720 --> 01:51:23,650
your next run that way we don't have a

3180
01:51:21,609 --> 01:51:25,420
bunch of downtime that way as soon as

3181
01:51:23,649 --> 01:51:27,129
these plants are harvested you can move

3182
01:51:25,420 --> 01:51:29,800
fresh plants right into that grow room

3183
01:51:27,130 --> 01:51:31,900
and never miss a day in the future I do

3184
01:51:29,800 --> 01:51:34,570
plan on updating my perpetual grow

3185
01:51:31,899 --> 01:51:37,989
lesson I did write a very long perpetual

3186
01:51:34,569 --> 01:51:39,309
grow podcast I think it is episode 73 so

3187
01:51:37,989 --> 01:51:41,649
if you're interested in scheduling a

3188
01:51:39,310 --> 01:51:43,510
perpetual grow go check out episode 73

3189
01:51:41,649 --> 01:51:45,189
but I will update that because in

3190
01:51:43,510 --> 01:51:46,960
Colorado we have made quite a few

3191
01:51:45,189 --> 01:51:49,689
changes to our laws I want to write a

3192
01:51:46,960 --> 01:51:51,850
perpetual grow episode based around our

3193
01:51:49,689 --> 01:51:54,339
Colorado plant count limits so that is

3194
01:51:51,850 --> 01:51:56,829
coming in the future but let's focus on

3195
01:51:54,340 --> 01:51:58,989
today you need to get plants prepared

3196
01:51:56,829 --> 01:52:02,019
for your next run if you have got an

3197
01:51:58,989 --> 01:52:04,239
available veg space so now's the time to

3198
01:52:02,020 --> 01:52:06,400
buy clones or acquire clones from either

3199
01:52:04,239 --> 01:52:08,319
your fellow growers or a dispensary or

3200
01:52:06,399 --> 01:52:10,509
however you get them or now is the time

3201
01:52:08,319 --> 01:52:12,219
to start germinating seeds and getting

3202
01:52:10,510 --> 01:52:14,110
them started so that when that grow room

3203
01:52:12,220 --> 01:52:16,090
is empty we can clean it up and we can

3204
01:52:14,109 --> 01:52:18,130
refill it and you never miss a day in

3205
01:52:16,090 --> 01:52:20,050
there so that is the basics of week

3206
01:52:18,130 --> 01:52:22,539
seven of the flowering cycle let's move

3207
01:52:20,050 --> 01:52:24,250
right into week eight in week eight we

3208
01:52:22,539 --> 01:52:26,500
want to continue to reduce the

3209
01:52:24,250 --> 01:52:28,899
temperature and humidity let's get that

3210
01:52:26,500 --> 01:52:30,850
humidity down between 25 and 35 percent

3211
01:52:28,899 --> 01:52:32,139
relative humidity this will make it a

3212
01:52:30,850 --> 01:52:34,150
little bit dry in the room for the last

3213
01:52:32,140 --> 01:52:36,340
two weeks but it will also help us

3214
01:52:34,149 --> 01:52:38,379
prevent powdery mildew and boy try this

3215
01:52:36,340 --> 01:52:40,840
we don't want to get mold right at the

3216
01:52:38,380 --> 01:52:42,699
center of our big giant buds so let's

3217
01:52:40,840 --> 01:52:43,150
start by reducing the humidity the next

3218
01:52:42,699 --> 01:52:45,670
thing we can

3219
01:52:43,149 --> 01:52:48,039
do is we can reduce the temperature by

3220
01:52:45,670 --> 01:52:49,449
three to five degrees at this plane of

3221
01:52:48,039 --> 01:52:52,329
the face I would like to be somewhere

3222
01:52:49,448 --> 01:52:54,969
between 70 and 74 degrees Fahrenheit

3223
01:52:52,329 --> 01:52:57,158
during the lights on cycle now week

3224
01:52:54,969 --> 01:52:59,500
eight is what I call the final swell

3225
01:52:57,158 --> 01:53:01,389
week you will see your buds take off

3226
01:52:59,500 --> 01:53:03,130
they will get huge they will get chunky

3227
01:53:01,390 --> 01:53:05,469
they will start becoming covered in

3228
01:53:03,130 --> 01:53:07,779
trichomes it is time to really start

3229
01:53:05,469 --> 01:53:11,560
paying attention to your trichomes with

3230
01:53:07,779 --> 01:53:12,670
a 60 or 100x powered microscope you need

3231
01:53:11,560 --> 01:53:14,770
to get in there and look at those

3232
01:53:12,670 --> 01:53:16,630
trichome heads see what color they are

3233
01:53:14,770 --> 01:53:18,610
are they clear are they getting that

3234
01:53:16,630 --> 01:53:20,739
milky whitish blue color have they

3235
01:53:18,609 --> 01:53:22,779
started becoming amber that is how you

3236
01:53:20,738 --> 01:53:24,609
determine the ripeness of your cannabis

3237
01:53:22,779 --> 01:53:26,229
plants so it's time to get in there and

3238
01:53:24,609 --> 01:53:28,869
start paying close attention to the

3239
01:53:26,229 --> 01:53:30,759
trichomes on our cannabis plants now

3240
01:53:28,869 --> 01:53:33,279
these plants are also going to be super

3241
01:53:30,760 --> 01:53:35,530
sticky and super stinky but they should

3242
01:53:33,279 --> 01:53:38,079
also be putting off some amazing colors

3243
01:53:35,529 --> 01:53:41,050
so now is another great opportunity to

3244
01:53:38,079 --> 01:53:42,908
take more photography as we enter the

3245
01:53:41,050 --> 01:53:44,560
flush phase we will start seeing more

3246
01:53:42,908 --> 01:53:46,029
colors come from the plants we're going

3247
01:53:44,560 --> 01:53:47,679
to start removing nutrients from the

3248
01:53:46,029 --> 01:53:49,210
plant we're gonna push some of the color

3249
01:53:47,679 --> 01:53:51,039
out some of the green is going to

3250
01:53:49,210 --> 01:53:53,109
disappear which will allow room for reds

3251
01:53:51,039 --> 01:53:54,488
and golds and a lot of great colors that

3252
01:53:53,109 --> 01:53:56,289
you didn't know we're coming from these

3253
01:53:54,488 --> 01:53:59,198
plants this is going to be an exciting

3254
01:53:56,289 --> 01:54:00,880
two weeks so we've reduced the humidity

3255
01:53:59,198 --> 01:54:03,519
we have reduced the temperature now

3256
01:54:00,880 --> 01:54:06,579
let's start flushing our plants flushing

3257
01:54:03,520 --> 01:54:08,170
is free I have done an entire episode on

3258
01:54:06,579 --> 01:54:10,738
flushing our cannabis plants it is

3259
01:54:08,170 --> 01:54:13,449
episode 320 by go into great detail

3260
01:54:10,738 --> 01:54:15,968
quickly here I will explain how and why

3261
01:54:13,448 --> 01:54:17,589
we flush for the past at least nine

3262
01:54:15,969 --> 01:54:19,090
weeks we have been shoving nutrients

3263
01:54:17,590 --> 01:54:21,579
into these plants they are filled with a

3264
01:54:19,090 --> 01:54:23,380
lot of nutrients we do not want to smoke

3265
01:54:21,579 --> 01:54:25,059
all of those nutrients they are stored

3266
01:54:23,380 --> 01:54:27,010
in the buds they are stored within that

3267
01:54:25,060 --> 01:54:28,840
plant by flushing the plant we are

3268
01:54:27,010 --> 01:54:31,119
starving it of nutrients we will make

3269
01:54:28,840 --> 01:54:33,219
that plant use up all of the nutrients

3270
01:54:31,119 --> 01:54:35,380
stored within its systems we will also

3271
01:54:33,219 --> 01:54:37,600
remove all of the nutrients from the

3272
01:54:35,380 --> 01:54:39,579
soil so we basically want to wash out

3273
01:54:37,600 --> 01:54:41,650
the medium to make no nutrients

3274
01:54:39,579 --> 01:54:43,569
available to allow that plant to starve

3275
01:54:41,649 --> 01:54:45,219
itself so that it will use up all of the

3276
01:54:43,569 --> 01:54:47,380
nutrients that is stored over its

3277
01:54:45,219 --> 01:54:49,149
flowering cycle by removing the

3278
01:54:47,380 --> 01:54:51,909
nutrients from all of the buds it will

3279
01:54:49,149 --> 01:54:54,670
make the buds burn and smoke and taste

3280
01:54:51,908 --> 01:54:56,379
much better if they are properly dried

3281
01:54:54,670 --> 01:54:57,039
and cured we still need to get all the

3282
01:54:56,380 --> 01:54:58,989
way through a har

3283
01:54:57,039 --> 01:55:01,119
mist and drain cure phase but at this

3284
01:54:58,989 --> 01:55:03,760
point flushing is the first step to

3285
01:55:01,119 --> 01:55:05,619
getting a tasty final product so let's

3286
01:55:03,760 --> 01:55:07,750
start flushing flushing is very easy

3287
01:55:05,619 --> 01:55:09,760
when you water the plants don't add any

3288
01:55:07,750 --> 01:55:11,800
nutrients you can adjust the pH

3289
01:55:09,760 --> 01:55:13,900
somewhere between six two and six five

3290
01:55:11,800 --> 01:55:16,180
and just water the plants until you get

3291
01:55:13,899 --> 01:55:18,460
twenty percent runoff if you pour in a

3292
01:55:16,180 --> 01:55:20,500
gallon of water in a pot you want twenty

3293
01:55:18,460 --> 01:55:22,659
percent of that gallon to run right out

3294
01:55:20,500 --> 01:55:24,520
of the bottom of that pot so give them a

3295
01:55:22,659 --> 01:55:26,889
few heavy waterings and you will wash

3296
01:55:24,520 --> 01:55:28,930
out all of those nutrients then just

3297
01:55:26,890 --> 01:55:31,329
continue to water until harvest time

3298
01:55:28,930 --> 01:55:33,640
that is flushing it is simple and it is

3299
01:55:31,329 --> 01:55:35,939
free and it will make your plants taste

3300
01:55:33,640 --> 01:55:38,470
so much better if you do it correctly

3301
01:55:35,939 --> 01:55:39,879
have you ever smoked flowers that taste

3302
01:55:38,470 --> 01:55:42,820
like you just stuck your tongue in a

3303
01:55:39,880 --> 01:55:45,039
light socket chances are those buds were

3304
01:55:42,819 --> 01:55:47,829
not flushed properly that person did not

3305
01:55:45,039 --> 01:55:49,840
allow a 10 to 14 day flush phase before

3306
01:55:47,829 --> 01:55:51,939
he harvested his plants and now they

3307
01:55:49,840 --> 01:55:53,619
taste like complete [ __ ] flush your

3308
01:55:51,939 --> 01:55:55,659
plants I centered a couple times already

3309
01:55:53,619 --> 01:55:57,460
it is free why don't you want to do free

3310
01:55:55,659 --> 01:55:59,920
[ __ ] to your plants you don't have to

3311
01:55:57,460 --> 01:56:00,909
use nutrients and it saves time all you

3312
01:55:59,920 --> 01:56:03,069
gotta do is fill the container with

3313
01:56:00,909 --> 01:56:05,529
water adjust the pH pour it on the damn

3314
01:56:03,069 --> 01:56:07,299
plants let's flush the plants that is

3315
01:56:05,529 --> 01:56:09,399
what we were going to focus on in weeks

3316
01:56:07,300 --> 01:56:11,590
eight through nine is flushing the

3317
01:56:09,399 --> 01:56:13,989
plants for harvest so that they taste

3318
01:56:11,590 --> 01:56:16,150
good once we dry and cure them now

3319
01:56:13,989 --> 01:56:18,849
before I harvest I like to do a pre

3320
01:56:16,149 --> 01:56:21,879
harvest defoliation I generally like to

3321
01:56:18,850 --> 01:56:23,860
do this seven to ten days before harvest

3322
01:56:21,880 --> 01:56:25,750
so that may happen in the middle of week

3323
01:56:23,859 --> 01:56:28,089
eight or at the beginning of week nine

3324
01:56:25,750 --> 01:56:29,619
any leaf that has a pea deal that I can

3325
01:56:28,090 --> 01:56:31,270
grab I just go in there and peel it

3326
01:56:29,619 --> 01:56:32,710
right off I don't need a bunch of leaves

3327
01:56:31,270 --> 01:56:34,780
at this point of the flowering phase

3328
01:56:32,710 --> 01:56:36,399
those leaves have done their job it is

3329
01:56:34,779 --> 01:56:37,989
almost time to cut down these plants I

3330
01:56:36,399 --> 01:56:39,699
want to make the harvest crews job just

3331
01:56:37,989 --> 01:56:41,380
a little bit easier so I like to go

3332
01:56:39,699 --> 01:56:43,960
through and pull off all of the big

3333
01:56:41,380 --> 01:56:46,810
leaves seven to ten days before harvest

3334
01:56:43,960 --> 01:56:49,630
now that is a good way to segue us right

3335
01:56:46,810 --> 01:56:51,070
into week number nine at the beginning

3336
01:56:49,630 --> 01:56:53,140
of week nine if you haven't done it

3337
01:56:51,069 --> 01:56:55,479
already feel free to go in there and

3338
01:56:53,140 --> 01:56:57,039
pull off all of the big leaves those

3339
01:56:55,479 --> 01:56:58,899
leaves have done their jobs we don't

3340
01:56:57,039 --> 01:57:01,090
need them anymore let's take them off of

3341
01:56:58,899 --> 01:57:02,379
there and get them out of the room now

3342
01:57:01,090 --> 01:57:05,140
let's talk about the environmental

3343
01:57:02,380 --> 01:57:07,510
conditions in our grow room for week

3344
01:57:05,140 --> 01:57:10,329
nine this is the final week of our

3345
01:57:07,510 --> 01:57:10,930
flowering phase I like to reduce the

3346
01:57:10,329 --> 01:57:13,329
humidity

3347
01:57:10,930 --> 01:57:15,430
- approximately 25 to 30 percent

3348
01:57:13,329 --> 01:57:17,649
humidity at the end of the flowering

3349
01:57:15,430 --> 01:57:20,230
phase my buds are huge my buds are

3350
01:57:17,649 --> 01:57:22,659
chunky I do not want to risk bud rot in

3351
01:57:20,229 --> 01:57:25,209
the middle of those buds so I reduced

3352
01:57:22,659 --> 01:57:27,639
that humidity down to about 25 percent

3353
01:57:25,210 --> 01:57:30,369
relative humidity in my flowering room I

3354
01:57:27,640 --> 01:57:33,579
also like to get it nice and cool if I

3355
01:57:30,369 --> 01:57:35,500
can get it about 70 to 74 degrees for

3356
01:57:33,579 --> 01:57:37,689
the last week of flower that really will

3357
01:57:35,500 --> 01:57:39,220
make the colors pop out of the plants it

3358
01:57:37,689 --> 01:57:40,389
will make them more dense and it will

3359
01:57:39,220 --> 01:57:42,130
give you more trichomes

3360
01:57:40,390 --> 01:57:44,200
and I really think the plants pack on a

3361
01:57:42,130 --> 01:57:46,180
little beef once it gets colder and it

3362
01:57:44,199 --> 01:57:47,859
will also speed them up I feel like

3363
01:57:46,180 --> 01:57:49,480
making it nice and cold at the end of

3364
01:57:47,859 --> 01:57:51,399
the season tricks our plants into

3365
01:57:49,479 --> 01:57:53,199
believing it is fall winter is coming

3366
01:57:51,399 --> 01:57:55,000
they say oh I don't have a lot of time

3367
01:57:53,199 --> 01:57:57,130
left to live so you really start doing

3368
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:58,930
everything they can do to ripen up and

3369
01:57:57,130 --> 01:58:00,250
reach the end of their life cycle so

3370
01:57:58,930 --> 01:58:02,140
that's why I try to make it a little

3371
01:58:00,250 --> 01:58:04,689
colder in the grow room at the end of

3372
01:58:02,140 --> 01:58:06,550
the Dro cycle another thing that a lot

3373
01:58:04,689 --> 01:58:08,739
of growers like to do at the end of a

3374
01:58:06,550 --> 01:58:11,289
flowering cycle is reduce the lights

3375
01:58:08,739 --> 01:58:13,420
currently you're probably running 12 on

3376
01:58:11,289 --> 01:58:15,880
and 12 off toward the end of the

3377
01:58:13,420 --> 01:58:19,060
flowering cycle you can always reduce it

3378
01:58:15,880 --> 01:58:20,980
to 10 on and 14 off reducing your light

3379
01:58:19,060 --> 01:58:23,050
cycle will also make the plants think

3380
01:58:20,979 --> 01:58:24,489
that the end is near they will speed up

3381
01:58:23,050 --> 01:58:26,560
a little bit and they will finish more

3382
01:58:24,489 --> 01:58:28,119
quickly I think that having it a little

3383
01:58:26,560 --> 01:58:29,800
bit cooler and having a little less

3384
01:58:28,119 --> 01:58:31,689
light in the room makes the plants

3385
01:58:29,800 --> 01:58:33,670
finish a little sooner it also makes

3386
01:58:31,689 --> 01:58:35,229
them pack on a little more trichomes it

3387
01:58:33,670 --> 01:58:37,600
makes the buds a little more dense and

3388
01:58:35,229 --> 01:58:40,239
also I think it gives us a little more

3389
01:58:37,600 --> 01:58:42,130
terpene presence terpenes are destroyed

3390
01:58:40,239 --> 01:58:44,079
by light terpenes are destroyed by

3391
01:58:42,130 --> 01:58:45,819
warmth why not give them a little cool

3392
01:58:44,079 --> 01:58:48,189
and a little dark and we can have a

3393
01:58:45,819 --> 01:58:49,630
little more Terps and we're also saving

3394
01:58:48,189 --> 01:58:51,639
a little bit of money we're not using

3395
01:58:49,630 --> 01:58:53,109
nutrients because we're flushing and now

3396
01:58:51,640 --> 01:58:54,670
we're running the lights for two hours

3397
01:58:53,109 --> 01:58:56,949
less per day so we're saving electricity

3398
01:58:54,670 --> 01:58:58,930
we're saving the electricity on running

3399
01:58:56,949 --> 01:59:00,429
the bulbs plus we're probably saving a

3400
01:58:58,930 --> 01:59:01,690
little bit of electricity on cooling

3401
01:59:00,430 --> 01:59:03,340
since we don't have to cool to fight

3402
01:59:01,689 --> 01:59:05,949
those lights so we're saving electricity

3403
01:59:03,340 --> 01:59:08,020
and we're also saving time on our gear

3404
01:59:05,949 --> 01:59:09,909
so why not reduce the lights just a

3405
01:59:08,020 --> 01:59:11,800
couple of hours at the last week of

3406
01:59:09,909 --> 01:59:13,300
flower now here's a little secret that I

3407
01:59:11,800 --> 01:59:15,400
haven't shared with a lot of people if

3408
01:59:13,300 --> 01:59:17,320
you've got a plant that takes way too

3409
01:59:15,399 --> 01:59:19,089
long to flower and you need to speed it

3410
01:59:17,319 --> 01:59:21,489
up just a little bit you can reduce

3411
01:59:19,090 --> 01:59:23,369
those lights by 4 hours at the end of

3412
01:59:21,489 --> 01:59:25,000
flowering and those plants will finish

3413
01:59:23,369 --> 01:59:27,159
approximately a week

3414
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:29,350
earlier if you've got a ten-week strain

3415
01:59:27,159 --> 01:59:31,269
or an 11-week strain and at the end of

3416
01:59:29,350 --> 01:59:33,910
week 9 you crank those lights down to

3417
01:59:31,270 --> 01:59:37,000
eight hours on at 16 hours off that

3418
01:59:33,909 --> 01:59:38,829
plant will finish one solid week early

3419
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:40,239
now you may not get the harvest weight

3420
01:59:38,829 --> 01:59:42,699
you would get if you let it go for that

3421
01:59:40,239 --> 01:59:44,769
full 11 or 12 week period but sometimes

3422
01:59:42,699 --> 01:59:46,659
we just need the plants to be done we

3423
01:59:44,770 --> 01:59:48,610
need that space we need that room so

3424
01:59:46,659 --> 01:59:51,039
that is always a trick you can use to

3425
01:59:48,609 --> 01:59:52,389
speed up some plants so we have reduced

3426
01:59:51,039 --> 01:59:54,189
humidity we have reduced our

3427
01:59:52,390 --> 01:59:56,380
temperatures now we've reduced our light

3428
01:59:54,189 --> 01:59:58,960
cycle we are on the final homestretch

3429
01:59:56,380 --> 02:00:01,329
here in week 9 keep flushing don't add

3430
01:59:58,960 --> 02:00:04,090
any nutrients obviously please do not

3431
02:00:01,329 --> 02:00:05,739
apply any pesticides or any foliar feeds

3432
02:00:04,090 --> 02:00:07,690
to your plants this late and flower you

3433
02:00:05,739 --> 02:00:09,939
will taste it you will notice it it will

3434
02:00:07,689 --> 02:00:12,369
ruin the entire crop this week is our

3435
02:00:09,939 --> 02:00:14,500
final bulking and ripening week you will

3436
02:00:12,369 --> 02:00:16,149
see that final book come on they'll

3437
02:00:14,500 --> 02:00:17,409
start getting fat and chunky all of your

3438
02:00:16,149 --> 02:00:18,699
leaves are gonna start getting yellow

3439
02:00:17,409 --> 02:00:19,840
and starting to droop down and get a

3440
02:00:18,699 --> 02:00:21,819
little crinkly because we've been

3441
02:00:19,840 --> 02:00:23,500
flushing and hopefully you're paying

3442
02:00:21,819 --> 02:00:25,420
attention to those trichomes because

3443
02:00:23,500 --> 02:00:27,399
this is when the trichomes are really

3444
02:00:25,420 --> 02:00:30,010
going to start turning amber and showing

3445
02:00:27,399 --> 02:00:32,439
their progress so week 9 is the bulk and

3446
02:00:30,010 --> 02:00:34,780
ripen week it is almost time to chop

3447
02:00:32,439 --> 02:00:37,059
down the plants so keep a close eye on

3448
02:00:34,779 --> 02:00:39,130
the trichomes we've been flushing if you

3449
02:00:37,060 --> 02:00:40,539
decide the plants are not done and you

3450
02:00:39,130 --> 02:00:42,670
want to let them go a little bit longer

3451
02:00:40,539 --> 02:00:44,710
you can let them flower for an extra

3452
02:00:42,670 --> 02:00:46,779
week and you don't have to give them any

3453
02:00:44,710 --> 02:00:48,609
more nutrients don't mess your whole

3454
02:00:46,779 --> 02:00:50,349
cycle up by adding nutrients in and then

3455
02:00:48,609 --> 02:00:51,759
trying to cut it down seven days later

3456
02:00:50,350 --> 02:00:53,829
you've already been flushing you're

3457
02:00:51,760 --> 02:00:55,930
already doing it perfectly don't mess it

3458
02:00:53,829 --> 02:00:58,479
up now if it needs to go longer

3459
02:00:55,930 --> 02:01:00,789
let it go longer if you are early in

3460
02:00:58,479 --> 02:01:03,429
flower and you anticipate you may need

3461
02:01:00,789 --> 02:01:05,920
an extra week or two again repeat my

3462
02:01:03,430 --> 02:01:07,780
advice from week seven week seven is

3463
02:01:05,920 --> 02:01:10,270
where you extend your schedule if you're

3464
02:01:07,779 --> 02:01:11,409
going to go longer than three weeks so

3465
02:01:10,270 --> 02:01:13,870
let's act like we are right on schedule

3466
02:01:11,409 --> 02:01:15,670
we're ending up week nine we have d

3467
02:01:13,869 --> 02:01:17,500
foliated the plants we haven't ran into

3468
02:01:15,670 --> 02:01:19,989
any problems the next thing to think

3469
02:01:17,500 --> 02:01:22,960
about is do you have your harvest and

3470
02:01:19,989 --> 02:01:26,019
drying and curing area prepared are you

3471
02:01:22,960 --> 02:01:28,420
ready for a sticky stinky time consuming

3472
02:01:26,020 --> 02:01:30,400
and space consuming harvest when you cut

3473
02:01:28,420 --> 02:01:32,590
down the plants where are you going to

3474
02:01:30,399 --> 02:01:34,869
hang them they're going to be there for

3475
02:01:32,590 --> 02:01:37,119
at least a week maybe 7 to 14 days

3476
02:01:34,869 --> 02:01:38,409
depending on your environment do you

3477
02:01:37,119 --> 02:01:40,630
have space for that

3478
02:01:38,409 --> 02:01:42,939
it's secure is it safe will people be

3479
02:01:40,630 --> 02:01:45,699
showing up when people show up are they

3480
02:01:42,939 --> 02:01:47,379
going to smell your hanging plants do

3481
02:01:45,699 --> 02:01:49,630
you need to plan ahead to keep that

3482
02:01:47,380 --> 02:01:51,159
aroma away from visitors do you need to

3483
02:01:49,630 --> 02:01:53,319
do something to keep intruders and

3484
02:01:51,159 --> 02:01:55,300
thieves away from that harvested product

3485
02:01:53,319 --> 02:01:57,460
now is the time to start thinking about

3486
02:01:55,300 --> 02:01:58,930
that you don't want to say hey it's the

3487
02:01:57,460 --> 02:02:00,100
time to cut down these plants and walk

3488
02:01:58,930 --> 02:02:01,900
in there with scissors and cut them down

3489
02:02:00,100 --> 02:02:04,650
and then you're stuck you don't know

3490
02:02:01,899 --> 02:02:07,449
what to do start thinking about that now

3491
02:02:04,649 --> 02:02:09,670
ladies and gentlemen the next step in my

3492
02:02:07,449 --> 02:02:11,710
grow lessons is harvest our next step is

3493
02:02:09,670 --> 02:02:13,630
to harvest these plants that is only

3494
02:02:11,710 --> 02:02:15,159
followed by drying and curing and the

3495
02:02:13,630 --> 02:02:17,710
next step after that is to clean and

3496
02:02:15,159 --> 02:02:20,079
reset our grow rooms so if you've made

3497
02:02:17,710 --> 02:02:22,420
it this far you are one episode from

3498
02:02:20,079 --> 02:02:24,159
cutting down your plants then after that

3499
02:02:22,420 --> 02:02:26,710
all we've got to do is dry it and cure

3500
02:02:24,159 --> 02:02:29,109
it and the step after that is finally

3501
02:02:26,710 --> 02:02:31,029
sampling our finished product

3502
02:02:29,109 --> 02:02:32,170
ladies and gentlemen I'm proud of you I

3503
02:02:31,029 --> 02:02:33,969
hope you've made it all the way through

3504
02:02:32,170 --> 02:02:36,340
nine weeks of flowering without any

3505
02:02:33,970 --> 02:02:37,900
issues if you did run into issues I hope

3506
02:02:36,340 --> 02:02:39,730
you were able to solve those problems

3507
02:02:37,899 --> 02:02:41,949
without messing up your crop if you've

3508

3715
02:09:45,800 --> 02:09:50,480
forward YouTube you guys all of the

3716
02:09:48,020 --> 02:09:52,100
YouTube videos are caught up I did it it

3717
02:09:50,479 --> 02:09:57,069
took a long time but they are finally

3718
02:09:52,100 --> 02:10:01,280
there that was a multi-year project

3719
02:09:57,069 --> 02:10:03,229
YouTube got evil right at the scariest

3720
02:10:01,279 --> 02:10:04,429
time yeah I was just about caught up and

3721
02:10:03,229 --> 02:10:05,179
then all of the YouTube channels started

3722
02:10:04,430 --> 02:10:07,789
disappearing

3723
02:10:05,180 --> 02:10:12,200
I don't put videos of myself consuming

3724
02:10:07,789 --> 02:10:13,579
on this channel I talk heavily about it

3725
02:10:12,199 --> 02:10:15,289
they don't see it so unless they're

3726
02:10:13,579 --> 02:10:17,689
looking for it and someone reports it we

3727
02:10:15,289 --> 02:10:19,550
should be okay we'll see how long it

3728
02:10:17,689 --> 02:10:20,899
lasts either way if it does disappear

3729
02:10:19,550 --> 02:10:22,210
I'll find any place to put it don't

3730
02:10:20,899 --> 02:10:24,469
worry

3731
02:10:22,210 --> 02:10:25,640
YouTube is uh that's just another place

3732
02:10:24,470 --> 02:10:26,750
for more people to listen to the show I

3733
02:10:25,640 --> 02:10:28,520
think we'll probably

3734
02:10:26,750 --> 02:10:31,340
to get more more lessons more views more

3735
02:10:28,520 --> 02:10:32,570
interactions alright Mike you got

3736
02:10:31,340 --> 02:10:36,529
anything to say before we start talking

3737
02:10:32,569 --> 02:10:38,179
about determining ripeness on cannabis

3738
02:10:36,529 --> 02:10:40,309
plants you got me topics you want to

3739
02:10:38,180 --> 02:10:42,530
bring before we get on a ramble here not

3740
02:10:40,310 --> 02:10:45,500
yeah well suits Mike says we'll see

3741
02:10:42,529 --> 02:10:47,269
where this takes us alright so a lot of

3742
02:10:45,500 --> 02:10:49,369
people were talking on Instagram live

3743
02:10:47,270 --> 02:10:51,590
and on chat rooms right now about how to

3744
02:10:49,369 --> 02:10:56,180
decide when to harvest their cannabis

3745
02:10:51,590 --> 02:10:57,289
when is my cannabis ripe the seed packs

3746
02:10:56,180 --> 02:11:00,230
are gonna tell you a certain timeframe

3747
02:10:57,289 --> 02:11:02,060
they're gonna say 56 to 63 days they're

3748
02:11:00,229 --> 02:11:06,019
gonna say 63 to 70 days they're gonna

3749
02:11:02,060 --> 02:11:08,870
say 9 to 10 weeks the first time you run

3750
02:11:06,020 --> 02:11:11,180
that pack of seeds I would say go the

3751
02:11:08,869 --> 02:11:13,279
longest time frame that they give you as

3752
02:11:11,180 --> 02:11:14,030
an option at least plan for it for sure

3753
02:11:13,279 --> 02:11:16,219
yes

3754
02:11:14,029 --> 02:11:18,829
yeah if it says 10 wheat 9 to 10 weeks

3755
02:11:16,220 --> 02:11:20,510
go to 10 weeks because maybe in that

3756
02:11:18,829 --> 02:11:23,000
last week that's when you're gonna see

3757
02:11:20,510 --> 02:11:24,619
extra trichomes pack on you're gonna see

3758
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:27,170
the extra weight come on you're gonna

3759
02:11:24,619 --> 02:11:29,180
see maybe some cool colors you might you

3760
02:11:27,170 --> 02:11:31,489
may you may see some [ __ ] you don't see

3761
02:11:29,180 --> 02:11:33,320
if you cut it down at week 9 so let it

3762
02:11:31,489 --> 02:11:36,829
go 10 weeks if it says 10 weeks if it

3763
02:11:33,319 --> 02:11:39,259
says 56 to 63 days let it go 63 well let

3764
02:11:36,829 --> 02:11:39,909
it go 65 if it looks okay and see what

3765
02:11:39,260 --> 02:11:43,820
happens

3766
02:11:39,909 --> 02:11:47,510
so that being said the way to determine

3767
02:11:43,819 --> 02:11:50,059
ripeness of your cannabis plants is not

3768
02:11:47,510 --> 02:11:56,619
by looking at the hairs

3769
02:11:50,060 --> 02:11:59,750
it is not by looking at it's not looking

3770
02:11:56,619 --> 02:12:05,229
I'm just I'm hearing different people

3771
02:11:59,750 --> 02:12:07,789
throughout my cannabis career like

3772
02:12:05,229 --> 02:12:10,099
speaking at length about how all of

3773
02:12:07,789 --> 02:12:12,859
those are telltale signs of like either

3774
02:12:10,100 --> 02:12:15,200
perfect they're pretty good or completed

3775
02:12:12,859 --> 02:12:17,689
or ready to harvest and it's all

3776
02:12:15,199 --> 02:12:19,639
nonsense yeah what we are growing

3777
02:12:17,689 --> 02:12:22,549
cannabis for the viable part that we

3778
02:12:19,640 --> 02:12:24,800
want are the trichomes why would we look

3779
02:12:22,550 --> 02:12:26,449
at anything but the trichomes right we

3780
02:12:24,800 --> 02:12:28,310
want to harvest those when they're at

3781
02:12:26,449 --> 02:12:30,829
the right best point so we should be

3782
02:12:28,310 --> 02:12:32,600
paying attention to the trichomes the

3783
02:12:30,829 --> 02:12:34,309
only way you can do that you can if

3784
02:12:32,600 --> 02:12:37,100
somebody tells you they can see the

3785
02:12:34,310 --> 02:12:39,350
trichomes with their naked eye either

3786
02:12:37,100 --> 02:12:40,630
steal their eyes or kick them in the

3787
02:12:39,350 --> 02:12:42,730
dick because they're a liar

3788
02:12:40,630 --> 02:12:44,859
you cannot see amber trichomes without

3789
02:12:42,729 --> 02:12:47,259
some sort of magnification you need at

3790
02:12:44,859 --> 02:12:49,689
least 60 X maybe a hundred X

3791
02:12:47,260 --> 02:12:53,320
magnification to see if a trichome is

3792
02:12:49,689 --> 02:12:56,109
clear cloudy silver milky amber busted

3793
02:12:53,319 --> 02:12:58,329
ruptured if the heads broken off of it

3794
02:12:56,109 --> 02:12:59,859
you need magnification you cannot see

3795
02:12:58,329 --> 02:13:01,988
that with the naked eye and if you can

3796
02:12:59,859 --> 02:13:05,649
you're [ __ ] awesome send me a message

3797
02:13:01,988 --> 02:13:07,509
I want to hear about it good get on

3798
02:13:05,649 --> 02:13:09,250
Amazon start looking the scopes folks

3799
02:13:07,510 --> 02:13:11,560
yeah get yourself a like a jeweler's

3800
02:13:09,250 --> 02:13:13,600
loupe I have a scope from Dino light

3801
02:13:11,560 --> 02:13:16,030
that hooks up to my computer I plug it

3802
02:13:13,600 --> 02:13:18,760
right into the USB slot it took me just

3803
02:13:16,029 --> 02:13:20,769
a few minutes to mess with the drivers

3804
02:13:18,760 --> 02:13:22,869
to make it link up to my computer once

3805
02:13:20,770 --> 02:13:25,000
it linked up it was no problem ever I

3806
02:13:22,869 --> 02:13:27,550
opened up the application I'm able to

3807
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:28,899
run the scope over the plants and I can

3808
02:13:27,550 --> 02:13:31,869
focus it in and I can see those

3809
02:13:28,899 --> 02:13:32,319
trichomes very large on my computer

3810
02:13:31,869 --> 02:13:33,939
screen

3811
02:13:32,319 --> 02:13:36,009
and it makes it very and I can take

3812
02:13:33,939 --> 02:13:37,178
pictures so if I can't tell exactly what

3813
02:13:36,010 --> 02:13:39,400
I'm looking at I can reach over and I

3814
02:13:37,179 --> 02:13:41,619
think I press f11 and I take the photo

3815
02:13:39,399 --> 02:13:43,149
right there boom then I can go look

3816
02:13:41,619 --> 02:13:45,519
later and I can see if that plants ripe

3817
02:13:43,149 --> 02:13:47,408
or not the the computerized scope makes

3818
02:13:45,520 --> 02:13:48,790
life a lot easier but you can pick up

3819
02:13:47,408 --> 02:13:51,399
something kind of like a jeweler's loupe

3820
02:13:48,789 --> 02:13:53,920
it's a lot less expensive and just as

3821
02:13:51,399 --> 02:13:55,719
functional the 420 scope will work for

3822
02:13:53,920 --> 02:13:57,670
you just a basic jeweler's loupe will

3823
02:13:55,719 --> 02:14:00,219
work for you there's one that Hydrofarm

3824
02:13:57,670 --> 02:14:01,719
sells it spreads in half it's got

3825
02:14:00,219 --> 02:14:03,189
batteries in it and it splits in half

3826
02:14:01,719 --> 02:14:04,569
and the batteries are in one side and

3827
02:14:03,189 --> 02:14:07,599
the optics are actually on the other

3828
02:14:04,569 --> 02:14:09,460
side they make a 60 and a 100x I would

3829
02:14:07,600 --> 02:14:11,500
recommend the 100x if you go for that

3830
02:14:09,460 --> 02:14:12,939
that's probably the best one on the

3831
02:14:11,500 --> 02:14:14,800
market if you're gonna get something

3832
02:14:12,939 --> 02:14:17,408
like that but I'm aware of there's

3833
02:14:14,800 --> 02:14:18,429
probably something better by now but get

3834
02:14:17,408 --> 02:14:20,408
some magnification

3835
02:14:18,429 --> 02:14:22,539
magnification will help you out in so

3836
02:14:20,408 --> 02:14:24,519
many ways you'll be able to tell if your

3837
02:14:22,539 --> 02:14:25,840
trichomes are clear if they're silver if

3838
02:14:24,520 --> 02:14:27,880
they're cloudy if they're milky if

3839
02:14:25,840 --> 02:14:30,069
they're amber if they're ruptured also

3840
02:14:27,880 --> 02:14:31,690
you'll be able to identify the pests and

3841
02:14:30,069 --> 02:14:33,189
the funguses and the problems on the

3842
02:14:31,689 --> 02:14:35,198
undersides of your leaves more

3843
02:14:33,189 --> 02:14:37,119
accurately if you've got a scope to look

3844
02:14:35,198 --> 02:14:39,309
at those there's a really useful tool

3845
02:14:37,119 --> 02:14:40,779
throughout the growth cycle for sure

3846
02:14:39,310 --> 02:14:43,179
yeah once you've got all of your tools

3847
02:14:40,779 --> 02:14:44,859
dialed in and you've got some money to

3848
02:14:43,179 --> 02:14:45,310
spend on a couple extra toys for the

3849
02:14:44,859 --> 02:14:47,439
grow room

3850
02:14:45,310 --> 02:14:49,179
get yourself a scope it will really help

3851
02:14:47,439 --> 02:14:50,888
a scope or a loop or something that

3852
02:14:49,179 --> 02:14:53,440
hooks up to your computer

3853
02:14:50,889 --> 02:14:55,630
all right so the hairs are not gonna

3854
02:14:53,439 --> 02:14:56,799
tell you how ready your plant is Mike

3855
02:14:55,630 --> 02:14:58,779
just tapped his headphones are you too

3856
02:14:56,800 --> 02:15:00,429
hot there no I just got it all right

3857
02:14:58,779 --> 02:15:02,618
scratch it up buddy good boy good boy

3858
02:15:00,429 --> 02:15:10,600
he's like starting to go scratching

3859
02:15:02,618 --> 02:15:12,158
behind his ear you guys which are the

3860
02:15:10,600 --> 02:15:13,510
trichomes we're drawing for trichomes

3861
02:15:12,158 --> 02:15:15,189
that's what we want if you're going to

3862
02:15:13,510 --> 02:15:16,270
make quality flowers if you're gonna

3863
02:15:15,189 --> 02:15:17,559
make edibles if you're gonna make

3864
02:15:16,270 --> 02:15:19,420
extracts if you're gonna make anything

3865
02:15:17,560 --> 02:15:23,260
the trichomes are what matter so pay

3866
02:15:19,420 --> 02:15:25,179
attention to that nothing else now the

3867
02:15:23,260 --> 02:15:26,770
way that you can tell the trichomes

3868
02:15:25,179 --> 02:15:28,449
you're gonna see the trichomes develop

3869
02:15:26,770 --> 02:15:29,770
on your plant if you have a scope and

3870
02:15:28,448 --> 02:15:31,269
you can pay attention through the entire

3871
02:15:29,770 --> 02:15:32,949
process do that

3872
02:15:31,270 --> 02:15:35,080
watch those trichomes go from a little

3873
02:15:32,948 --> 02:15:38,109
bitty stalk watch them develop a head

3874
02:15:35,079 --> 02:15:40,750
watch the head of that trichome fill up

3875
02:15:38,109 --> 02:15:42,759
you'll watch it fill up it'll get juicy

3876
02:15:40,750 --> 02:15:44,920
and then it'll start to change colors

3877
02:15:42,760 --> 02:15:48,100
it'll go from clear then it will slowly

3878
02:15:44,920 --> 02:15:49,029
turn to like a silver ish color then

3879
02:15:48,100 --> 02:15:51,190
it'll get cloudy

3880
02:15:49,029 --> 02:15:52,779
you'll be once you see it you'll know

3881
02:15:51,189 --> 02:15:55,178
right now you're going what does he mean

3882
02:15:52,779 --> 02:15:56,979
by cloudy you've got to imagine if you

3883
02:15:55,179 --> 02:15:58,840
got a fishbowl and then you put some

3884
02:15:56,979 --> 02:16:00,698
dish soap in there and stirred it up

3885
02:15:58,840 --> 02:16:02,679
it's cloudy that's what you're cloudy

3886
02:16:00,698 --> 02:16:05,169
trichomes are gonna look like that's

3887
02:16:02,679 --> 02:16:08,260
cloudy now your next step after cloudy

3888
02:16:05,170 --> 02:16:10,389
is milky sometimes they turn kind of

3889
02:16:08,260 --> 02:16:13,449
bluish in my opinion they have a hint of

3890
02:16:10,389 --> 02:16:15,429
blue they have that if you stir it like

3891
02:16:13,448 --> 02:16:17,319
certain white paints and whatnot you'll

3892
02:16:15,429 --> 02:16:19,480
start to see a blue kind of undertone a

3893
02:16:17,319 --> 02:16:22,479
little bit yeah yeah and it's yeah a

3894
02:16:19,479 --> 02:16:24,669
nice patch of milky trichomes I always

3895
02:16:22,479 --> 02:16:26,289
see just a little hint of light blue in

3896
02:16:24,670 --> 02:16:27,908
there so the fishbowl I talked about a

3897
02:16:26,289 --> 02:16:30,010
minute ago imagine if I took your

3898
02:16:27,908 --> 02:16:31,299
fishbowl that had we dumped out the dish

3899
02:16:30,010 --> 02:16:33,370
so because this is just gonna get gross

3900
02:16:31,300 --> 02:16:34,960
if we keep adding stuff I'm gross let's

3901
02:16:33,370 --> 02:16:36,519
do this differently imagine if you took

3902
02:16:34,959 --> 02:16:39,339
a fishbowl that's got water in it and

3903
02:16:36,519 --> 02:16:42,609
you poured just enough milk in there to

3904
02:16:39,340 --> 02:16:44,679
make it turn light white light white not

3905
02:16:42,609 --> 02:16:46,630
it's not gonna be [ __ ] boom like ice

3906
02:16:44,679 --> 02:16:47,920
cream but it's gonna be light white like

3907
02:16:46,629 --> 02:16:49,629
you poured some creamer in your coffee

3908
02:16:47,920 --> 02:16:51,549
you just lighten it up you can see it

3909
02:16:49,629 --> 02:16:53,728
now now that trichome is what I would

3910
02:16:51,549 --> 02:16:57,549
call milky that is a milky trichome

3911
02:16:53,728 --> 02:16:59,648
you're almost ready for harvest the next

3912
02:16:57,549 --> 02:17:01,869
step that's gonna happen is gonna look

3913
02:16:59,648 --> 02:17:03,369
like you had a spray bottle imagine if I

3914
02:17:01,870 --> 02:17:04,960
took like the little spray bottle that

3915
02:17:03,370 --> 02:17:07,730
you're spraying your plants with or

3916
02:17:04,959 --> 02:17:09,769
little mr. bottle what if I poured some

3917
02:17:07,729 --> 02:17:13,189
dr. pepper in there and I walked right

3918
02:17:09,770 --> 02:17:16,219
up to your trichomes and just just give

3919
02:17:13,190 --> 02:17:18,500
it a little spritz of dr. pepper your

3920
02:17:16,218 --> 02:17:20,718
trichomes are gonna have a little amber

3921
02:17:18,500 --> 02:17:22,399
spritz on them now and that's exactly

3922
02:17:20,718 --> 02:17:23,779
what I think it looks like is like you

3923
02:17:22,399 --> 02:17:27,260
sprayed some soda right onto your

3924
02:17:23,780 --> 02:17:28,760
trichomes they're gonna go from milky

3925
02:17:27,260 --> 02:17:31,909
and then you're gonna see just a couple

3926
02:17:28,760 --> 02:17:33,620
of them get this amber color this dr.

3927
02:17:31,909 --> 02:17:35,239
pepper color right across them and

3928
02:17:33,620 --> 02:17:37,160
you're gonna see it happen toward the

3929
02:17:35,239 --> 02:17:39,049
top and kind of right in the middle and

3930
02:17:37,159 --> 02:17:41,030
then keep pay attention to the whole

3931
02:17:39,049 --> 02:17:43,639
planks it's gonna move around but when

3932
02:17:41,030 --> 02:17:44,930
you see that first bit of amber really

3933
02:17:43,639 --> 02:17:46,909
start paying attention because you've

3934
02:17:44,930 --> 02:17:48,680
got a very short time now they're gonna

3935
02:17:46,909 --> 02:17:50,479
start that amber is gonna start

3936
02:17:48,680 --> 02:17:53,719
progressing throughout the plant really

3937
02:17:50,479 --> 02:17:56,209
quickly and when you look at the scope

3938
02:17:53,718 --> 02:17:58,489
and you can see you're gonna have to

3939
02:17:56,209 --> 02:18:00,799
look around the plant when 30% of those

3940
02:17:58,489 --> 02:18:05,299
trichomes start becoming amber that's

3941
02:18:00,799 --> 02:18:07,099
when you want to cut down 30% now I say

3942
02:18:05,299 --> 02:18:08,779
look in several places you're gonna be

3943
02:18:07,100 --> 02:18:10,909
like 30% how do I know and I can see a

3944
02:18:08,780 --> 02:18:12,409
hundred trichomes in there just look

3945
02:18:10,909 --> 02:18:16,520
around and use your best judgement you

3946
02:18:12,409 --> 02:18:18,619
guys about 25 to 35 percent is where you

3947
02:18:16,520 --> 02:18:20,420
want to aim for you're not gonna notice

3948
02:18:18,620 --> 02:18:22,700
a difference if you're a few days off on

3949
02:18:20,420 --> 02:18:24,170
your harvest honestly you are not going

3950
02:18:22,700 --> 02:18:26,630
to notice a huge difference you've got a

3951
02:18:24,170 --> 02:18:28,729
drying cure period once you cut down

3952
02:18:26,629 --> 02:18:30,859
these plants those trichomes are going

3953
02:18:28,729 --> 02:18:33,139
to continue to change all the way until

3954
02:18:30,860 --> 02:18:35,270
the moment you combust them you're gonna

3955
02:18:33,139 --> 02:18:37,129
cut them down you've got this dry period

3956
02:18:35,270 --> 02:18:39,079
they're gonna get beat up and harvest

3957
02:18:37,129 --> 02:18:40,939
they're gonna get cured they're gonna

3958
02:18:39,079 --> 02:18:42,979
change there's going to be so many

3959
02:18:40,940 --> 02:18:44,659
different changes in those trichomes so

3960
02:18:42,979 --> 02:18:46,670
just a couple of days in your harvest

3961
02:18:44,659 --> 02:18:48,229
window will not make a huge difference

3962
02:18:46,670 --> 02:18:51,079
you're not gonna notice it it's not

3963
02:18:48,229 --> 02:18:52,369
gonna hurt your feelings so pay

3964
02:18:51,079 --> 02:18:54,649
attention to those trichomes get

3965
02:18:52,370 --> 02:18:57,170
yourself a scope they're gonna go clear

3966
02:18:54,649 --> 02:18:58,699
then they're gonna turn silver then

3967
02:18:57,170 --> 02:19:00,260
they're gonna get cloudy that's when it

3968
02:18:58,700 --> 02:19:01,820
starts getting excited their filter

3969
02:19:00,260 --> 02:19:04,159
that's getting exciting they're filling

3970
02:19:01,819 --> 02:19:05,449
up with trichomes or with cannabinoids

3971
02:19:04,159 --> 02:19:07,100
now they've got different things in

3972
02:19:05,450 --> 02:19:09,050
their different psychoactive ingredients

3973
02:19:07,100 --> 02:19:11,180
inside of there that are changing every

3974
02:19:09,049 --> 02:19:13,099
day then they're gonna get milky they're

3975
02:19:11,180 --> 02:19:14,300
gonna turn a little bit blue then

3976
02:19:13,100 --> 02:19:16,610
they're gonna look like I sprayed them

3977
02:19:14,299 --> 02:19:17,239
with dr. pepper when three out of ten

3978
02:19:16,610 --> 02:19:19,640
when

3979
02:19:17,239 --> 02:19:23,379
30% of them have that dr. pepper stain

3980
02:19:19,639 --> 02:19:26,269
on him that's when it's time to cut so

3981
02:19:23,379 --> 02:19:29,449
you're gonna say but it's my first grow

3982
02:19:26,270 --> 02:19:32,060
with this plant how do I plan that how

3983
02:19:29,450 --> 02:19:34,730
do I properly be able to flush and look

3984
02:19:32,059 --> 02:19:36,949
out for trichomes to be Amber I thought

3985
02:19:34,729 --> 02:19:40,639
of a great way that we can all be safe

3986
02:19:36,950 --> 02:19:41,870
you keep in mind this isn't gonna be the

3987
02:19:40,639 --> 02:19:43,219
last time you're growing this strain

3988
02:19:41,870 --> 02:19:44,480
hopefully this is the first time you

3989
02:19:43,219 --> 02:19:45,769
drew it that's why you don't know when

3990
02:19:44,479 --> 02:19:46,939
the trichomes are gonna change colors

3991
02:19:45,770 --> 02:19:48,229
that's why you don't know how long it's

3992
02:19:46,940 --> 02:19:49,700
gonna take it's the first time you're

3993
02:19:48,229 --> 02:19:51,709
developing a relationship with this

3994
02:19:49,700 --> 02:19:53,780
plant the first time you got to learn it

3995
02:19:51,709 --> 02:19:55,129
the second third time you dial it in the

3996
02:19:53,780 --> 02:19:57,260
fourth and fifth time you [ __ ]

3997
02:19:55,129 --> 02:19:59,420
perfect this grow so you're just

3998
02:19:57,260 --> 02:20:02,030
learning this one so keep think about it

3999
02:19:59,420 --> 02:20:05,479
this way if you're growing a 60 day

4000
02:20:02,030 --> 02:20:07,760
plant if the package says grow it fir 55

4001
02:20:05,479 --> 02:20:10,609
to 60 days go that 60 days if you're

4002
02:20:07,760 --> 02:20:12,079
gonna go for 60 days flush it day 50 and

4003
02:20:10,610 --> 02:20:14,150
really start paying attention to those

4004
02:20:12,079 --> 02:20:15,681
trichomes if you want to cut it down at

4005
02:20:14,149 --> 02:20:18,920
a specific day just make sure you

4006
02:20:15,681 --> 02:20:21,710
flushed 7 to 10 days pretty heavily I'd

4007
02:20:18,920 --> 02:20:24,590
like to go 14 but 7 to 10 days should be

4008
02:20:21,709 --> 02:20:26,569
plenty if you want to let your plant go

4009
02:20:24,590 --> 02:20:28,819
70 days if you've got something I bred

4010
02:20:26,569 --> 02:20:31,729
you probably want to let it go 70 days

4011
02:20:28,819 --> 02:20:33,920
if I bred it 70 days no problem start

4012
02:20:31,729 --> 02:20:35,869
flushing at day 60 and pay attention to

4013
02:20:33,920 --> 02:20:37,851
your trichomes you can cut down at day

4014
02:20:35,870 --> 02:20:39,260
70 if you don't feel like it's ready let

4015
02:20:37,851 --> 02:20:41,090
it go a little bit longer it doesn't

4016
02:20:39,260 --> 02:20:42,649
need nutrients to keep going it's just

4017
02:20:41,090 --> 02:20:46,069
gonna start getting tired but then you

4018
02:20:42,649 --> 02:20:48,681
can give it time to ripen up so I think

4019
02:20:46,069 --> 02:20:51,799
the way to judge when to harvest your

4020
02:20:48,681 --> 02:20:53,360
cannabis is by paying attention to the

4021
02:20:51,799 --> 02:20:54,949
trichomes if you don't have a way to

4022
02:20:53,360 --> 02:20:57,409
look at the trichomes you don't have a

4023
02:20:54,950 --> 02:20:59,030
way to accurately judge the ripeness of

4024
02:20:57,409 --> 02:21:01,280
your cannabis plants and you run the

4025
02:20:59,030 --> 02:21:02,840
risk of cutting them way too early is

4026
02:21:01,280 --> 02:21:04,909
what most people do if you feel like

4027
02:21:02,840 --> 02:21:06,649
they're done wait three to five more

4028
02:21:04,909 --> 02:21:08,690
days if you can wait seven more days

4029
02:21:06,649 --> 02:21:10,640
wait because they're only gonna get

4030
02:21:08,690 --> 02:21:14,810
better and don't cut too early because

4031
02:21:10,640 --> 02:21:16,940
you're anxious and eager patience you

4032
02:21:14,810 --> 02:21:18,681
cut clones or you grew from seeds and

4033
02:21:16,940 --> 02:21:20,329
those took time then you've edged it out

4034
02:21:18,681 --> 02:21:21,170
you spent a lot of money on nutrients

4035
02:21:20,329 --> 02:21:23,090
you've already spent

4036
02:21:21,170 --> 02:21:25,940
you're probably gonna put a hundred and

4037
02:21:23,090 --> 02:21:28,010
fifteen days into it why not put 120 -

4038
02:21:25,940 --> 02:21:30,020
what's another week right I know you

4039
02:21:28,010 --> 02:21:31,520
start getting itchy start getting that

4040
02:21:30,020 --> 02:21:33,470
crackhead lips and he started scratching

4041
02:21:31,520 --> 02:21:34,729
your neck like yeah I want to cut it I'm

4042
02:21:33,469 --> 02:21:37,158
thinking of a friend of mine who was

4043
02:21:34,728 --> 02:21:38,568
always in that clip in lower nut he'd

4044
02:21:37,158 --> 02:21:41,238
start at the bottom of the planter

4045
02:21:38,568 --> 02:21:44,209
taking notes and drying him out as fast

4046
02:21:41,238 --> 02:21:45,618
as he could to keep himself covered and

4047
02:21:44,209 --> 02:21:47,750
by the time we got the harvest it was

4048
02:21:45,619 --> 02:21:49,909
just like the top coal is left on the

4049
02:21:47,750 --> 02:21:51,529
plan yeah and then there's nothing to

4050
02:21:49,908 --> 02:21:54,020
enjoy because you fast ride everything

4051
02:21:51,529 --> 02:21:56,810
and you could have just had one huge

4052
02:21:54,020 --> 02:21:58,039
harvest and actually saw his dog see you

4053
02:21:56,809 --> 02:21:59,898
can see what it looks like what your

4054
02:21:58,039 --> 02:22:01,550
work actually did instead of just

4055
02:21:59,898 --> 02:22:03,709
destroying your work slowly not getting

4056
02:22:01,549 --> 02:22:05,420
any reward yeah so be patient you guys

4057
02:22:03,709 --> 02:22:07,368
that's that's one of the main things

4058
02:22:05,420 --> 02:22:08,779
that it's hard to learn when you're

4059
02:22:07,369 --> 02:22:10,789
growing cannabis sometimes you just need

4060
02:22:08,779 --> 02:22:15,319
to hide your scissors send Mike home

4061
02:22:10,789 --> 02:22:20,930
with the scissors like you're on suicide

4062
02:22:15,318 --> 02:22:22,250
watch or something so I guess that was a

4063
02:22:20,930 --> 02:22:23,658
pretty quick way to do it but I mean

4064
02:22:22,250 --> 02:22:25,728
that's right to the point there's no

4065
02:22:23,658 --> 02:22:27,020
other way to explain that get a

4066
02:22:25,728 --> 02:22:29,090
jeweler's loupe get some sort of

4067
02:22:27,020 --> 02:22:31,189
magnification and look at your trichomes

4068
02:22:29,090 --> 02:22:35,270
I know I keep saying it we're drawing

4069
02:22:31,189 --> 02:22:37,488
for trichomes you just got to get in

4070
02:22:35,270 --> 02:22:39,560
there with some magnification and spend

4071
02:22:37,488 --> 02:22:40,639
some time reading the plant yeah we

4072
02:22:39,559 --> 02:22:42,559
don't we're not worried about all the

4073
02:22:40,639 --> 02:22:43,908
green leafy part I mean that part tastes

4074
02:22:42,559 --> 02:22:45,680
good that's fun to smoke that's a cool

4075
02:22:43,908 --> 02:22:47,988
carrier but the trichomes are the goal

4076
02:22:45,680 --> 02:22:50,510
so make sure they're ripe something that

4077
02:22:47,988 --> 02:22:53,930
I should add if you are growing for

4078
02:22:50,510 --> 02:22:56,359
concentrates maybe cut a little bit

4079
02:22:53,930 --> 02:22:58,939
early start flushing early and harvest a

4080
02:22:56,359 --> 02:23:00,500
little bit early because once the if you

4081
02:22:58,939 --> 02:23:02,270
want nice and clear concentrates maybe

4082
02:23:00,500 --> 02:23:03,260
this is some industry secrets secrets I

4083
02:23:02,270 --> 02:23:05,060
shouldn't be sharing with the general

4084
02:23:03,260 --> 02:23:07,039
public but here you go guys I love you

4085
02:23:05,059 --> 02:23:08,629
and this is free if you want nice and

4086
02:23:07,039 --> 02:23:11,180
clear concentrates cut your plants down

4087
02:23:08,629 --> 02:23:14,179
before the trichomes start getting dark

4088
02:23:11,180 --> 02:23:15,770
if they start getting dark what you are

4089
02:23:14,180 --> 02:23:18,020
extracting is trichomes your

4090
02:23:15,770 --> 02:23:19,488
concentrates will come out a little bit

4091
02:23:18,020 --> 02:23:21,408
darker cut them down when they're nice

4092
02:23:19,488 --> 02:23:23,420
and clear and guess what nice and clear

4093
02:23:21,408 --> 02:23:24,949
concentrates it's easier a lot of a lot

4094
02:23:23,420 --> 02:23:26,539
of concentrate makers can make super

4095
02:23:24,949 --> 02:23:28,520
clear concentrates out of everything now

4096
02:23:26,539 --> 02:23:30,350
but it's easier it's less to clean up

4097
02:23:28,520 --> 02:23:32,270
it's less work if you're pulling it down

4098
02:23:30,350 --> 02:23:34,729
when you have got nice and clear

4099
02:23:32,270 --> 02:23:36,109
trichomes early and process quickly yep

4100
02:23:34,728 --> 02:23:37,929
they cut them down I don't even want to

4101
02:23:36,109 --> 02:23:39,828
tell you what week sometimes like

4102
02:23:37,930 --> 02:23:41,359
sevenish I've seen it go the

4103
02:23:39,828 --> 02:23:43,489
concentrates yeah a little bit

4104
02:23:41,359 --> 02:23:44,899
ridiculous but then you can pull a whole

4105
02:23:43,489 --> 02:23:46,340
one more harvest a year if you cut

4106
02:23:44,899 --> 02:23:47,899
everything down at the end of week six

4107
02:23:46,340 --> 02:23:51,079
that you could feel one more harvest a

4108
02:23:47,899 --> 02:23:53,000
year in your schedule that's business

4109
02:23:51,079 --> 02:23:55,549
unfortunately you guys do not do that be

4110
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:59,329
patient let it go long enough let it be

4111
02:23:55,549 --> 02:24:01,340
done like Axl Rose said all we need is

4112

02:25:02,569 --> 02:25:06,500
I start to show off by letting you know

4143
02:25:04,069 --> 02:25:09,469
what I'm smoking today I'm taking dad's

4144
02:25:06,500 --> 02:25:11,750
a fatso OG from Green Dot labs this is

4145
02:25:09,469 --> 02:25:13,760
the fat sow OG full-spectrum extract

4146
02:25:11,750 --> 02:25:15,530
it's nice and chunky it's got just the

4147
02:25:13,760 --> 02:25:16,969
right amount of chunky crystals and just

4148
02:25:15,530 --> 02:25:19,370
the right amount of Terp sauce in there

4149
02:25:16,969 --> 02:25:21,439
I really do approve of that ratio the

4150
02:25:19,370 --> 02:25:24,050
cross on this or the blend actually is

4151
02:25:21,440 --> 02:25:26,659
GMO and legend OG the flavor is

4152
02:25:24,049 --> 02:25:28,399
described as dark roast coffee garlic

4153
02:25:26,659 --> 02:25:30,649
and fuel and I feel like that is

4154
02:25:28,399 --> 02:25:32,329
absolutely accurate it has given me some

4155
02:25:30,649 --> 02:25:33,920
ridiculous cottonmouth I feel like you

4156
02:25:32,329 --> 02:25:35,899
can almost hear it on the microphone

4157
02:25:33,920 --> 02:25:37,399
ladies and gentlemen I've been having a

4158
02:25:35,899 --> 02:25:39,350
really busy couple of weeks I've been

4159
02:25:37,399 --> 02:25:41,750
out of town twice I'm going back out of

4160
02:25:39,350 --> 02:25:44,450
town Thursday I have a comedy show in

4161

Expo in Denver on Saturday and Sunday so

4163
02:25:47,540 --> 02:25:52,040
I am doing another repost for this

4164
02:25:49,610 --> 02:25:53,840
episode the last episode was determining

4165
02:25:52,040 --> 02:25:55,430
ripeness now that we know when the

4166
02:25:53,840 --> 02:25:57,199
plants are ripe it is time to begin

4167
02:25:55,430 --> 02:25:59,449
flushing our plan

4168
02:25:57,199 --> 02:26:01,279
I feel that many new growers and many

4169
02:25:59,449 --> 02:26:03,050
experienced growers overlooked the

4170
02:26:01,279 --> 02:26:05,689
importance of flushing our plants and it

4171
02:26:03,049 --> 02:26:07,188
is not happening properly I'm gonna say

4172
02:26:05,689 --> 02:26:09,318
this in the episode over and over again

4173
02:26:07,189 --> 02:26:11,418
but flushing is free and it can improve

4174
02:26:09,318 --> 02:26:13,368
the overall quality of your finished

4175
02:26:11,418 --> 02:26:15,260
product so why wouldn't we focus heavily

4176
02:26:13,369 --> 02:26:17,748
on flushing at the end of the growth

4177
02:26:15,260 --> 02:26:19,760
cycle I'm sure I'm gonna say that plenty

4178
02:26:17,748 --> 02:26:21,318
of times through this episode so with no

4179
02:26:19,760 --> 02:26:23,539
further ado let's jump right into an

4180
02:26:21,318 --> 02:26:25,879

known as Mary's motivation at a going

4196
02:26:54,889 --> 02:26:59,358
away party I went to that going-away

4197
02:26:56,510 --> 02:27:01,998
party and I smoked way too much flour

4198
02:26:59,359 --> 02:27:03,470
and way too much concentrate and my

4199
02:27:01,998 --> 02:27:04,340
voice sounds like crap I got a little

4200
02:27:03,469 --> 02:27:05,988
bit of a chest cold

4201
02:27:04,340 --> 02:27:07,549
I got a throat thing going on I got a

4202
02:27:05,988 --> 02:27:09,799
sinus thing happening and before we get

4203
02:27:07,549 --> 02:27:11,118
too far I just want to apologize and I

4204
02:27:09,799 --> 02:27:14,299
want to thank you for listening to this

4205
02:27:11,119 --> 02:27:15,470
episode while I sound like poop all

4206
02:27:14,299 --> 02:27:17,148
right I'd like to start the episode off

4207
02:27:15,469 --> 02:27:19,578
by letting you know what I'm smoking on

4208
02:27:17,148 --> 02:27:22,099
today I'm taking little baby dabs of

4209
02:27:19,578 --> 02:27:23,869
gorilla glue for ambrosia and also I've

4210
02:27:22,100 --> 02:27:26,418
got some of the New York City bezel

4211
02:27:23,869 --> 02:27:28,970
ambrosia batter both from apothecary

4212
02:27:26,418 --> 02:27:30,408
it's been a nice mix fiscal and light

4213
02:27:28,969 --> 02:27:32,118
today just trying to stay lightly

4214
02:27:30,408 --> 02:27:33,978
medicated and not mess up my lungs and

4215
02:27:32,119 --> 02:27:37,159
throat again I'm on the path to recovery

4216
02:27:33,978 --> 02:27:39,198
and I want to keep moving forward so a

4217
02:27:37,158 --> 02:27:40,788
minute ago I mentioned that I went to my

4218
02:27:39,199 --> 02:27:42,649
friend Brett also known as Mary's

4219
02:27:40,789 --> 02:27:44,829
motivation I went to Brett's going-away

4220
02:27:42,648 --> 02:27:46,728
party Brett is leaving the country

4221
02:27:44,828 --> 02:27:48,260
Brett's a little scared and nervous

4222
02:27:46,728 --> 02:27:50,958
about his trip but honestly I don't

4223
02:27:48,260 --> 02:27:52,789
think anybody deserves this more Brett

4224
02:27:50,959 --> 02:27:54,199
needs to make this adventure happen I

4225
02:27:52,789 --> 02:27:55,970
think it's going to be a great

4226
02:27:54,199 --> 02:27:59,180
experience for him so I am super proud

4227
02:27:55,969 --> 02:28:01,788
and super excited for him his party was

4228
02:27:59,180 --> 02:28:04,100
awesome at the party we were joined by

4229
02:28:01,789 --> 02:28:06,649
of course the always awesome Brett was

4230
02:28:04,100 --> 02:28:08,720

4231
02:28:06,648 --> 02:28:10,579

4234
02:28:12,500 --> 02:28:16,430
twisty seeds who I don't see very often

4235
02:28:14,329 --> 02:28:18,200
I got to have a conversation a long

4236
02:28:16,430 --> 02:28:20,600
conversation with Chandler dabbing that

4237
02:28:18,200 --> 02:28:23,271
was pretty cool Earle tycoon was there

4238
02:28:20,600 --> 02:28:25,790
the dude from hits on hand was there LJ

4239
02:28:23,271 --> 02:28:27,320
fresh was there and several other new

4240
02:28:25,790 --> 02:28:29,450
and old friends who they're hanging out

4241
02:28:27,319 --> 02:28:31,190
it was a great party there were a couple

4242
02:28:29,450 --> 02:28:33,829
of folks there who brought Koenig ours

4243
02:28:31,190 --> 02:28:36,590
which are basically blunts rolled with

4244
02:28:33,829 --> 02:28:38,271
cannabis leaves as the wrapper that

4245
02:28:36,590 --> 02:28:40,579
really [ __ ] up my lungs you guys my

4246
02:28:38,271 --> 02:28:42,380
lungs did not like that at all

4247
02:28:40,579 --> 02:28:44,690
they were delicious to smoke and we got

4248
02:28:42,379 --> 02:28:47,299
really lit but that is why I think I

4249
02:28:44,690 --> 02:28:49,280
sound like crap today so shout out to

4250
02:28:47,299 --> 02:28:50,779
Bret for the great party the party was a

4251
02:28:49,280 --> 02:28:53,360
private party so not a lot of people

4252
02:28:50,780 --> 02:28:54,860
were invited the event was at cultivated

4253
02:28:53,360 --> 02:28:56,720
synergy I owe a huge shout out to

4254
02:28:54,860 --> 02:28:58,370
everybody at cultivated synergy every

4255
02:28:56,719 --> 02:29:00,529
time we do an event there every time we

4256
02:28:58,370 --> 02:29:03,290
do a large or small party there it goes

4257
02:29:00,530 --> 02:29:05,239

4258

huge shout out to Bret for inviting me

4262
02:29:11,090 --> 02:29:16,940
who's only able to invite 30 people I

4263
02:29:13,219 --> 02:29:18,260
was honored to be amongst those 30 it

4264
02:29:16,940 --> 02:29:19,970
was a great party you guys we smoked

4265
02:29:18,260 --> 02:29:21,680
that place out for how few people there

4266
02:29:19,969 --> 02:29:24,020
were in there is a pretty big building

4267
02:29:21,680 --> 02:29:26,060
and we smoked that [ __ ] out pretty good

4268
02:29:24,021 --> 02:29:27,380
you can hear to my voice still alright

4269
02:29:26,060 --> 02:29:29,750
while I've still got some good voice

4270
02:29:27,379 --> 02:29:32,319
left let's do a quick podcast about

4271
02:29:29,750 --> 02:29:34,790
flushing your plants before harvest

4272
02:29:32,319 --> 02:29:37,459
before we talk about flushing I should

4273
02:29:34,790 --> 02:29:40,430
do a quick recap in the last episode I

4274
02:29:37,459 --> 02:29:42,589
talked about determining ripeness Mike

4275
02:29:40,430 --> 02:29:44,271
and I went fairly fast and we got kinda

4276
02:29:42,590 --> 02:29:46,729
rambly so I hope I made it clear that

4277
02:29:44,271 --> 02:29:48,590
determining ripeness is usually done by

4278
02:29:46,729 --> 02:29:51,319
using some sort of a loop so that you

4279
02:29:48,590 --> 02:29:54,950
can see the trichomes I mentioned using

4280
02:29:51,319 --> 02:29:56,899
a sixty or 100x loop one of our friends

4281
02:29:54,950 --> 02:29:59,870
from Instagram what's up dank Sinatra

4282
02:29:56,899 --> 02:30:02,810
our friend Dane Sinatra I shear photo

4283
02:29:59,870 --> 02:30:05,030
and seeds sent me a message and he says

4284
02:30:02,810 --> 02:30:06,799
now I can't see trichomes with my naked

4285
02:30:05,030 --> 02:30:09,320
eye but I can tell ripeness of a

4286
02:30:06,799 --> 02:30:12,500
trichome with a 16 acted jeweler's loupe

4287
02:30:09,319 --> 02:30:13,219
they said of course in my mind I'm in my

4288
02:30:12,500 --> 02:30:16,250
mid-20s

4289
02:30:13,219 --> 02:30:17,359
so my eyes may work a little better yes

4290
02:30:16,250 --> 02:30:21,260
dude you are a little bit younger than

4291
02:30:17,360 --> 02:30:22,940
me you got those fresh new eyes but he

4292
02:30:21,260 --> 02:30:23,988
corrected me he says he can see the

4293
02:30:22,940 --> 02:30:25,789
trichomes with this

4294
02:30:23,988 --> 02:30:28,219
sixteen axe Jewelers loop so you may not

4295
02:30:25,789 --> 02:30:31,369
need that bigger loop that 60 that 100

4296
02:30:28,219 --> 02:30:34,188
he says the 60 is working or the 16 is

4297
02:30:31,369 --> 02:30:37,100
working for him so I stand corrected you

4298
02:30:34,189 --> 02:30:39,379
may not need that big loop 16 may get

4299
02:30:37,100 --> 02:30:41,088
you through all so let's recap a little

4300
02:30:39,379 --> 02:30:43,430
bit about what I said about harvest

4301
02:30:41,088 --> 02:30:45,648
times I said that if you have a plant

4302
02:30:43,430 --> 02:30:47,720
that is said to go 60 days let it go the

4303
02:30:45,648 --> 02:30:49,849
full 60 days and start flushing at day

4304
02:30:47,719 --> 02:30:52,759
50 if you've got a plant that's supposed

4305
02:30:49,850 --> 02:30:56,779
to go 70 days let it go the full 70 days

4306
02:30:52,759 --> 02:30:58,639
and start flushing around day 60 now you

4307
02:30:56,779 --> 02:31:00,560
may say Russ - Jeff I want to dial it in

4308
02:30:58,639 --> 02:31:01,488
and cut these plants down at the perfect

4309
02:31:00,559 --> 02:31:03,019
ripeness yes

4310
02:31:01,488 --> 02:31:04,788
you're going to have to dial that in

4311
02:31:03,020 --> 02:31:07,279
something I wanted to stress is this is

4312
02:31:04,789 --> 02:31:09,350
not your last grow with this strain

4313
02:31:07,279 --> 02:31:11,299
hopefully this is your first run with

4314
02:31:09,350 --> 02:31:13,220
this cultivar with this cut so now

4315
02:31:11,299 --> 02:31:15,079
you've got a new girlfriend that you've

4316
02:31:13,219 --> 02:31:16,849
got to learn a little bit you've got to

4317
02:31:15,078 --> 02:31:18,350
take her out a couple of times you got

4318
02:31:16,850 --> 02:31:23,119
to see if she wants to come down at day

4319
02:31:18,350 --> 02:31:26,059
60 day 63 maybe day 67 maybe day 72

4320
02:31:23,119 --> 02:31:27,078
you've got to dial it in exactly to the

4321
02:31:26,059 --> 02:31:28,759
right day now you're gonna see

4322
02:31:27,078 --> 02:31:30,770
differences if you use different

4323
02:31:28,759 --> 02:31:32,389
nutrients you may get different ripening

4324
02:31:30,770 --> 02:31:33,828
dates if you have a little bit of

4325
02:31:32,389 --> 02:31:36,108
temperature difference you may get a

4326
02:31:33,828 --> 02:31:37,878
different ripening date so you're gonna

4327
02:31:36,109 --> 02:31:40,220
have to find the window and dial that in

4328
02:31:37,879 --> 02:31:41,629
hopefully this is not your last girl

4329
02:31:40,219 --> 02:31:44,628
with this cut hopefully this is the

4330
02:31:41,629 --> 02:31:46,489
first of many grows with a good cut so

4331
02:31:44,629 --> 02:31:49,669
if it's your first run with the 60 day

4332
02:31:46,488 --> 02:31:51,048
cut start flushing around day 50 if this

4333
02:31:49,668 --> 02:31:53,628
is your first time with a cut that you

4334
02:31:51,049 --> 02:31:56,390
think may go 70 days start flushing it

4335
02:31:53,629 --> 02:31:57,949
around day 60 now when you get to day 60

4336
02:31:56,389 --> 02:31:59,930
or day 70 on whichever plant you're

4337
02:31:57,949 --> 02:32:01,430
running you don't have to cut it down

4338
02:31:59,930 --> 02:32:03,439
just because you've been flushing for 10

4339
02:32:01,430 --> 02:32:06,020
days start paying more attention to the

4340
02:32:03,439 --> 02:32:08,238
trichomes if they are not amber don't

4341
02:32:06,020 --> 02:32:10,488
cut it down keep flushing for a few more

4342
02:32:08,238 --> 02:32:11,809
days it's better to over flush then

4343
02:32:10,488 --> 02:32:13,458
under flush the only thing you're doing

4344
02:32:11,809 --> 02:32:14,628
is not giving it nutrients it may have

4345
02:32:13,459 --> 02:32:16,789
gotten a little bigger it may have

4346
02:32:14,629 --> 02:32:18,588
gotten a little beefier but we're just

4347
02:32:16,789 --> 02:32:22,489
trying to figure out the plant for the

4348
02:32:18,588 --> 02:32:25,309
first time so that is how to determine

4349
02:32:22,488 --> 02:32:26,898
when to begin flush if you don't know

4350
02:32:25,309 --> 02:32:28,458
the cultivar that you're using maybe

4351
02:32:26,898 --> 02:32:30,498
it's a brand new seed maybe it's a new

4352
02:32:28,459 --> 02:32:31,579
clone maybe you're just new at growing

4353
02:32:30,498 --> 02:32:34,128
and you don't know when to cut it

4354
02:32:31,578 --> 02:32:35,869
allowing the plant 60 to 70 days to grow

4355
02:32:34,129 --> 02:32:37,620
and then giving yourself extra time at

4356
02:32:35,869 --> 02:32:40,020
the end is always your best

4357
02:32:37,620 --> 02:32:42,510
that with a new cut all right so I feel

4358
02:32:40,020 --> 02:32:44,250
like I have established how to tell if

4359
02:32:42,510 --> 02:32:46,350
the plant is ripe and ready to cut down

4360
02:32:44,250 --> 02:32:48,510
and I feel like we have a good idea of

4361
02:32:46,350 --> 02:32:51,059
when to start flushing let's actually

4362
02:32:48,510 --> 02:32:53,850
talk about flushing our cannabis plants

4363
02:32:51,059 --> 02:32:55,049
I think flushing is super simple and

4364
02:32:53,850 --> 02:32:57,600
it's something people could easily

4365
02:32:55,049 --> 02:32:59,250
improve and they are really skipping

4366
02:32:57,600 --> 02:33:01,979
that step and I'm not sure why because

4367
02:32:59,250 --> 02:33:04,379
it's free it's a really easy step to

4368
02:33:01,978 --> 02:33:07,139
improve your cannabis and it is free

4369
02:33:04,379 --> 02:33:09,539
maybe people simply don't understand the

4370
02:33:07,139 --> 02:33:11,489
importance of flushing and why it's

4371
02:33:09,540 --> 02:33:14,130
important so let me tell you quickly why

4372
02:33:11,489 --> 02:33:17,309
flushing matters just imagine you've

4373
02:33:14,129 --> 02:33:19,949
been pouring salty nutrients into this

4374
02:33:17,309 --> 02:33:22,049
plant for nine weeks of flower plus

4375
02:33:19,950 --> 02:33:23,220
another three or four weeks of veg

4376
02:33:22,049 --> 02:33:25,438
you've just been filling it up with

4377
02:33:23,219 --> 02:33:26,879
nutrients you've been pouring whatever

4378
02:33:25,439 --> 02:33:27,870
nutrient brandy you're using you've been

4379
02:33:26,879 --> 02:33:29,279
pouring nitrogen

4380
02:33:27,870 --> 02:33:30,930
you've been pouring phosphorus you've

4381
02:33:29,280 --> 02:33:33,090
been pouring potassium and you've been

4382
02:33:30,930 --> 02:33:35,430
pouring carbohydrates into these plants

4383
02:33:33,090 --> 02:33:37,260
for the past twelve weeks now all of

4384
02:33:35,430 --> 02:33:39,540
that stuff is built up inside of that

4385
02:33:37,260 --> 02:33:40,950
plant the plant is not using all of it

4386
02:33:39,540 --> 02:33:42,899
it's letting some of it go it's turning

4387
02:33:40,950 --> 02:33:44,640
some of it into a gas and transpiring

4388
02:33:42,898 --> 02:33:45,358
some of it out but some of it is still

4389
02:33:44,639 --> 02:33:48,180
in the plant

4390
02:33:45,359 --> 02:33:50,520
if those nutrients are left in the plant

4391
02:33:48,180 --> 02:33:52,889
when we harvest dry and cure that plant

4392
02:33:50,520 --> 02:33:56,250
we're going to taste it the plants are

4393
02:33:52,889 --> 02:33:58,260
going to taste like crap if you feed too

4394
02:33:56,250 --> 02:34:00,180
much cal-mag too late in flower you're

4395
02:33:58,260 --> 02:34:02,069
going to taste it if you feed your

4396
02:34:00,180 --> 02:34:03,930
plants too much potassium silicon late

4397
02:34:02,069 --> 02:34:05,670
and flower you're going to taste it also

4398
02:34:03,930 --> 02:34:07,409
the plants are not going to burn

4399
02:34:05,670 --> 02:34:09,270
properly when you dry and cure these

4400
02:34:07,409 --> 02:34:10,739
buds they're not gonna smoke you're

4401
02:34:09,270 --> 02:34:12,300
gonna grind it up in a grinder you're

4402
02:34:10,739 --> 02:34:14,039
gonna roll a joint and it's just gonna

4403
02:34:12,299 --> 02:34:16,228
burn black and make a funky weird

4404
02:34:14,040 --> 02:34:18,780
charcoal that's because they're leftover

4405
02:34:16,228 --> 02:34:20,639
nutrients that you did not flush out we

4406
02:34:18,780 --> 02:34:22,979
can get that stuff out of there by

4407
02:34:20,639 --> 02:34:25,769
properly flushing the plants you were

4408
02:34:22,978 --> 02:34:27,569
mostly flushing the soil you want to

4409
02:34:25,770 --> 02:34:29,760
clean out the soil so there's nothing

4410
02:34:27,569 --> 02:34:32,549
left in your media but whether it's soil

4411
02:34:29,760 --> 02:34:34,770
soilless mix if you got peat whatever

4412
02:34:32,549 --> 02:34:36,750
you're working in you're gonna want to

4413
02:34:34,770 --> 02:34:39,239
flush that if it's rock wool if it's

4414
02:34:36,750 --> 02:34:40,439
cocoa you need to clean it out each

4415
02:34:39,239 --> 02:34:42,659
thing is going to take a different

4416
02:34:40,439 --> 02:34:44,189
amount of time to clean out but you want

4417
02:34:42,659 --> 02:34:46,590
to clean that out so the roots don't

4418
02:34:44,189 --> 02:34:48,420
have anything to eat then the plant will

4419
02:34:46,590 --> 02:34:50,728
start starving itself and it will start

4420
02:34:48,420 --> 02:34:51,870
showing as harvest fall colors and it

4421
02:34:50,728 --> 02:34:54,719
will taste proper

4422
02:34:51,870 --> 02:34:56,399
would you dry it cure it and smoke it so

4423
02:34:54,719 --> 02:34:58,079
that's why flushing is important you

4424
02:34:56,398 --> 02:35:00,420
want to get all those excess nutrients

4425
02:34:58,079 --> 02:35:02,670
out of there all those excess salts when

4426
02:35:00,420 --> 02:35:04,228
you roll a joint and smoke it you don't

4427
02:35:02,670 --> 02:35:06,719
want it to turn into a little briquette

4428
02:35:04,228 --> 02:35:09,959
you want it to turn into a nice white

4429
02:35:06,719 --> 02:35:13,438
fluffy ash and just flake away so that

4430
02:35:09,959 --> 02:35:15,148
comes from a properly flushed plant then

4431
02:35:13,439 --> 02:35:16,800
that also comes from a properly dried

4432
02:35:15,148 --> 02:35:19,019
cured and trimmed plant but that comes

4433
02:35:16,799 --> 02:35:21,329
in the future today we're focusing on

4434
02:35:19,020 --> 02:35:22,739
flushing so that's why flushing is

4435
02:35:21,329 --> 02:35:24,569
important you guys you want your herb to

4436
02:35:22,739 --> 02:35:27,180
taste good you want it to burn well and

4437
02:35:24,569 --> 02:35:30,148
you want it to leave a nice white clean

4438
02:35:27,180 --> 02:35:33,000
soft - with no weird Chuck

4439
02:35:30,148 --> 02:35:34,920
so let's actually talk about flushing

4440
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:38,040
the plants flushing the plants is really

4441
02:35:34,920 --> 02:35:40,350
easy about 10 to 14 days before you plan

4442
02:35:38,040 --> 02:35:41,370
on harvesting the plants prepare the

4443
02:35:40,350 --> 02:35:43,409
amount of water that you would normally

4444
02:35:41,370 --> 02:35:45,090
water the garden with if you've got

4445
02:35:43,409 --> 02:35:46,709
1,000 watt light maybe you've got a

4446
02:35:45,090 --> 02:35:49,139
five-gallon bucket full of water right

4447
02:35:46,709 --> 02:35:50,608
so get that amount of water ready when

4448
02:35:49,139 --> 02:35:53,159
you would normally put nutrients into

4449
02:35:50,609 --> 02:35:55,409
the water don't do that just don't put

4450
02:35:53,159 --> 02:35:57,600
nutrients in there maybe if you're gonna

4451
02:35:55,409 --> 02:35:59,609
add anything put some enzymes in there

4452
02:35:57,600 --> 02:36:02,280
if you're using an enzyme that will help

4453
02:35:59,609 --> 02:36:03,930
break down all the the decaying roots

4454
02:36:02,280 --> 02:36:06,090
and all the matter inside of the root

4455
02:36:03,930 --> 02:36:07,439
zone and it will speed up the process of

4456
02:36:06,090 --> 02:36:10,228
the flush it will help speed everything

4457
02:36:07,439 --> 02:36:11,790
up but enzymes are pretty much the only

4458
02:36:10,228 --> 02:36:14,969
thing I would put in there other than

4459
02:36:11,790 --> 02:36:17,280
maybe a little bit of shine maybe one to

4460
02:36:14,969 --> 02:36:19,289
two grams of shine from veg bloom but

4461
02:36:17,280 --> 02:36:21,149
you really don't need it mostly all you

4462
02:36:19,290 --> 02:36:22,680
would need is some enzymes for the last

4463
02:36:21,148 --> 02:36:26,010
couple of days if you're gonna flush for

4464
02:36:22,680 --> 02:36:28,260
14 days maybe go for like 4 to 7 days

4465
02:36:26,010 --> 02:36:30,030
add 2 grams of shine and add some

4466
02:36:28,260 --> 02:36:31,889
enzymes but then cut out the shine and

4467
02:36:30,030 --> 02:36:33,870
just keep the enzymes going until the

4468
02:36:31,889 --> 02:36:35,760
end of the process so the only thing

4469
02:36:33,870 --> 02:36:37,649
you'd put in there are enzymes and

4470
02:36:35,760 --> 02:36:40,139
possibly some shine but you would be

4471
02:36:37,648 --> 02:36:43,079
probably just fine with nothing at all

4472
02:36:40,139 --> 02:36:45,659
so clean water add the enzymes if you're

4473
02:36:43,079 --> 02:36:47,340
gonna do so for four to seven days add

4474
02:36:45,659 --> 02:36:51,000
the shine if you'd like to do so then

4475
02:36:47,340 --> 02:36:53,549
adjust the pH to somewhere between 63

4476
02:36:51,000 --> 02:36:55,200
and 65 you'll be just fine 63 and 65

4477
02:36:53,549 --> 02:36:58,500
that's a good window to adjust it to

4478
02:36:55,200 --> 02:37:00,540
then simply water the plants with that

4479
02:36:58,500 --> 02:37:02,489
minimal solution all you've got to do is

4480
02:37:00,540 --> 02:37:04,470
pour that right into the plants just

4481
02:37:02,489 --> 02:37:05,800
like you normally do when you water soak

4482
02:37:04,469 --> 02:37:08,170
the plants and let it run

4483
02:37:05,800 --> 02:37:10,380
now what you're doing pouring the

4484
02:37:08,171 --> 02:37:13,149
enzymes in there is going to help the

4485
02:37:10,380 --> 02:37:14,859
natural decaying process happen inside

4486
02:37:13,149 --> 02:37:16,600
that root zone there's dead things in

4487
02:37:14,860 --> 02:37:18,101
there the roots that are dying are dying

4488
02:37:16,601 --> 02:37:19,739
in there the enzymes are gonna eat that

4489
02:37:18,101 --> 02:37:22,421
and they're gonna speed up that process

4490
02:37:19,739 --> 02:37:23,771
also that shine is going to keep adding

4491
02:37:22,421 --> 02:37:25,690
density and trichomes

4492
02:37:23,771 --> 02:37:27,579
and essential oils to your plants if you

4493
02:37:25,690 --> 02:37:29,261
choose to add the shine you still need

4494
02:37:27,579 --> 02:37:30,729
to flush for the last week without the

4495
02:37:29,261 --> 02:37:32,261
shine you guys so make sure you cut that

4496
02:37:30,729 --> 02:37:34,060
out you can leave the enzymes in there

4497
02:37:32,261 --> 02:37:35,591
if you'd like to at the end but cut out

4498
02:37:34,060 --> 02:37:38,020
that shine for the last week

4499
02:37:35,591 --> 02:37:39,579
now you're probably at day 50 right if

4500
02:37:38,021 --> 02:37:41,620
we're gonna cut down at day 60 we're at

4501
02:37:39,579 --> 02:37:43,899
day 50 we just mixed up a bunch of water

4502
02:37:41,620 --> 02:37:46,931
and we just soaked that root zone so now

4503
02:37:43,899 --> 02:37:48,431
you've got pH water with enzymes and

4504
02:37:46,931 --> 02:37:50,140
possibly some shine running through

4505
02:37:48,431 --> 02:37:51,431
there those plants are gonna start

4506
02:37:50,140 --> 02:37:53,171
looking for phosphorous and potassium

4507
02:37:51,431 --> 02:37:54,461
and believed in them and all the other

4508
02:37:53,171 --> 02:37:56,409
things that they want there's 16

4509
02:37:54,460 --> 02:37:57,699
minerals that the plants really want you

4510
02:37:56,409 --> 02:37:59,351
guys start thinking about that and learn

4511
02:37:57,700 --> 02:38:00,370
all 16 of them that will really help you

4512
02:37:59,351 --> 02:38:02,351
think about what you're feeding your

4513
02:38:00,370 --> 02:38:03,820
plant maybe we'll talk about that in the

4514
02:38:02,351 --> 02:38:05,141
future but the plants gonna start

4515
02:38:03,819 --> 02:38:08,020
looking for that stuff and all its gonna

4516
02:38:05,140 --> 02:38:09,520
find our enzymes and shine it's gonna be

4517
02:38:08,021 --> 02:38:11,471
like well I've got essential oils I'm

4518
02:38:09,521 --> 02:38:12,909
gonna go beef up my trichomes and it's

4519
02:38:11,470 --> 02:38:14,770
got stuff to build trichomes but it

4520
02:38:12,909 --> 02:38:16,390
doesn't have the building blocks to grow

4521
02:38:14,771 --> 02:38:18,851
more plant material it doesn't have all

4522
02:38:16,390 --> 02:38:20,560
the nutrition that it needs to keep

4523
02:38:18,851 --> 02:38:22,511
building bigger buds and fatter stems

4524
02:38:20,560 --> 02:38:24,251
and going so it's gonna start showing

4525
02:38:22,511 --> 02:38:26,681
you its fall colors it's gonna start

4526
02:38:24,251 --> 02:38:28,210
turning into these yellow golden colors

4527
02:38:26,681 --> 02:38:30,040
you may get some reds you may get some

4528
02:38:28,210 --> 02:38:32,229
purples you'll get some unique oranges I

4529
02:38:30,040 --> 02:38:33,700
really like taking pictures of my plants

4530
02:38:32,229 --> 02:38:35,439
right right at the flush phase because

4531
02:38:33,700 --> 02:38:37,120
they really start showing great colors

4532
02:38:35,440 --> 02:38:39,310
the buds are nice and fat the trichomes

4533
02:38:37,120 --> 02:38:41,200
are all greasy and shiny and then the

4534
02:38:39,310 --> 02:38:43,239
leaves start getting these cool golden

4535
02:38:41,200 --> 02:38:45,341
tones to them but that's when you know

4536
02:38:43,239 --> 02:38:47,319
that the flush is working there are no

4537
02:38:45,341 --> 02:38:49,329
nutrients left in that soil for the

4538
02:38:47,319 --> 02:38:50,649
plant to eat and it is getting hungry

4539
02:38:49,329 --> 02:38:52,780
which is a good thing because now you

4540
02:38:50,649 --> 02:38:55,029
know that bud is gonna burn smoothly

4541
02:38:52,780 --> 02:38:57,971
it's not gonna have nitrogen phosphorus

4542
02:38:55,030 --> 02:38:59,950
potassium believed in them iron calcium

4543
02:38:57,970 --> 02:39:01,449
magnesium it's not gonna have all this

4544
02:38:59,950 --> 02:39:02,980
other funky [ __ ] in it that we don't

4545
02:39:01,450 --> 02:39:05,891
want to smoke it's just gonna be nice

4546
02:39:02,979 --> 02:39:07,960
and clean it'll burn nice and smoothly

4547
02:39:05,890 --> 02:39:09,369
and it will taste really good so you're

4548
02:39:07,960 --> 02:39:13,001
gonna start seeing these fall colors

4549
02:39:09,370 --> 02:39:16,511
come on that timing is going to depend

4550
02:39:13,001 --> 02:39:18,431
on your medium how much nutrients you

4551
02:39:16,511 --> 02:39:19,630
have been putting into the plant it's

4552
02:39:18,431 --> 02:39:22,390
gonna be very

4553
02:39:19,629 --> 02:39:24,188
strain-specific and also temperatures

4554
02:39:22,389 --> 02:39:26,228
are going to have a huge effect on this

4555
02:39:24,189 --> 02:39:28,210
if it's a little cooler in the room your

4556
02:39:26,228 --> 02:39:29,889
plants are gonna turn a little more fall

4557
02:39:28,209 --> 02:39:31,509
colors if you have a lower nighttime

4558
02:39:29,889 --> 02:39:33,369
temperature you'll see a little more

4559
02:39:31,510 --> 02:39:35,889
purple from the buds you'll get a little

4560
02:39:33,370 --> 02:39:38,860
more fall activity from the plants like

4561
02:39:35,889 --> 02:39:41,079
what happened in nature so you're gonna

4562
02:39:38,860 --> 02:39:42,700
mix up the solution you're gonna ph it

4563
02:39:41,079 --> 02:39:44,409
you're gonna water in the plants it's

4564
02:39:42,700 --> 02:39:47,040
gonna run out of the bottom then

4565
02:39:44,409 --> 02:39:50,139
depending on your container size and the

4566
02:39:47,040 --> 02:39:52,930
vapor pressure deficit in the room you

4567
02:39:50,139 --> 02:39:54,760
are going to have to water again repeat

4568
02:39:52,930 --> 02:39:57,069
the process you guys mix up your

4569
02:39:54,760 --> 02:40:00,670
container put the enzymes in there put

4570
02:39:57,069 --> 02:40:03,309
the shine in there pH adjusted to 6.3 to

4571
02:40:00,670 --> 02:40:05,889
6.5 and water it right through the plant

4572
02:40:03,309 --> 02:40:07,869
repeat this process right up to a week

4573
02:40:05,889 --> 02:40:09,909
before harvest and then do the same

4574
02:40:07,870 --> 02:40:13,479
thing but simply take out the shine add

4575
02:40:09,909 --> 02:40:16,420
the enzymes adjust the pH and then feed

4576
02:40:13,478 --> 02:40:19,000
it right through the plants now the

4577
02:40:16,420 --> 02:40:20,680
enzymes are totally not necessary the

4578
02:40:19,000 --> 02:40:22,600
shine is totally not necessary you can

4579
02:40:20,680 --> 02:40:24,639
do all of this with plain water if

4580
02:40:22,600 --> 02:40:26,860
you're adding the enzymes and shine you

4581
02:40:24,639 --> 02:40:29,379
were going to have connoisseur quality

4582
02:40:26,860 --> 02:40:31,720
cannabis that's what I would do I would

4583
02:40:29,379 --> 02:40:33,099
do the shine up to the last week then

4584
02:40:31,719 --> 02:40:34,719
after that I would just do the enzymes

4585
02:40:33,100 --> 02:40:36,280
and then I'd probably do just two or

4586
02:40:34,719 --> 02:40:38,469
three days of plain water just to give

4587
02:40:36,280 --> 02:40:41,260
them time to finish up there if I was

4588
02:40:38,469 --> 02:40:42,489
going at 60 days I would end up going 63

4589
02:40:41,260 --> 02:40:44,620
in that last three days would just be

4590
02:40:42,489 --> 02:40:47,379
plain water and my grow is what would

4591
02:40:44,620 --> 02:40:49,780
happen there so just keep repeating the

4592
02:40:47,379 --> 02:40:51,579
process you want to rinse these plants

4593
02:40:49,780 --> 02:40:54,010
out do you want to rinse the soil out as

4594
02:40:51,579 --> 02:40:56,170
many times as you can between the start

4595
02:40:54,010 --> 02:40:58,420
of flush and harvest so if you can get

4596
02:40:56,170 --> 02:41:00,670
it to dry up and re water it every other

4597
02:40:58,420 --> 02:41:02,799
day that's great if it takes three or

4598
02:41:00,670 --> 02:41:05,260
four days that's fine you're still going

4599
02:41:02,799 --> 02:41:06,879
to get if you do it twelve days we get

4600
02:41:05,260 --> 02:41:08,978
three waterings in there if you go every

4601
02:41:06,879 --> 02:41:10,299
four days but if you're taking that much

4602
02:41:08,978 --> 02:41:12,188
time to water that means you've got a

4603
02:41:10,299 --> 02:41:13,629
large container or that much time

4604
02:41:12,189 --> 02:41:15,280
between waterings means you've got a

4605
02:41:13,629 --> 02:41:17,019
large container which means you're using

4606
02:41:15,280 --> 02:41:19,300
quite a bit of water to flush that out

4607
02:41:17,020 --> 02:41:21,700
which means you need to make sure to get

4608
02:41:19,299 --> 02:41:23,199
at least by 10 to 30 percent runoff

4609
02:41:21,700 --> 02:41:25,180
water so if you got like a ten gallon

4610
02:41:23,200 --> 02:41:27,250
pot you're gonna want to get at least

4611
02:41:25,180 --> 02:41:28,270
one to two gallons of runoff coming out

4612
02:41:27,250 --> 02:41:30,069
of that that's how you know you're

4613
02:41:28,270 --> 02:41:32,140
flushing well so get plenty of water

4614
02:41:30,069 --> 02:41:32,898
coming out and then flush the [ __ ] out

4615
02:41:32,139 --> 02:41:34,939
of those plans

4616
02:41:32,898 --> 02:41:37,608
I do it as many times as you can but be

4617
02:41:34,939 --> 02:41:39,918
careful not to drown the plant don't try

4618
02:41:37,609 --> 02:41:41,418
to sneak in another flush time just to

4619
02:41:39,918 --> 02:41:43,488
get more water in there because that may

4620
02:41:41,418 --> 02:41:44,838
do more harm than good that may you may

4621
02:41:43,488 --> 02:41:46,458
kill the [ __ ] plant right there you

4622
02:41:44,838 --> 02:41:48,619
may just drown it you may suffocate it

4623
02:41:46,459 --> 02:41:50,779
that maybe be a maybe cutting down early

4624
02:41:48,619 --> 02:41:52,819
so don't ruin it right at the end be

4625
02:41:50,779 --> 02:41:54,319
careful to stay on your normal watering

4626
02:41:52,818 --> 02:41:56,448
schedule just make sure you soak the

4627
02:41:54,318 --> 02:41:58,010
[ __ ] out of it let it dry out water it

4628
02:41:56,449 --> 02:42:00,949
again do that as many times as you can

4629
02:41:58,010 --> 02:42:02,809
in the last 10 to 14 days and if you

4630
02:42:00,949 --> 02:42:04,729
want to add the enzymes do that you want

4631
02:42:02,809 --> 02:42:07,338
to use shine do that those are the only

4632
02:42:04,728 --> 02:42:10,668
things I would really add at the end so

4633
02:42:07,338 --> 02:42:12,498
we've determined how to tell if the

4634
02:42:10,668 --> 02:42:15,109
plants are ripe we've determined a good

4635
02:42:12,498 --> 02:42:17,208
time to start flushing we know what to

4636
02:42:15,109 --> 02:42:19,668
put in the water to flush the plants we

4637
02:42:17,209 --> 02:42:22,100
know why we're flushing we know how to

4638
02:42:19,668 --> 02:42:24,048
flush you basically don't mix anything

4639
02:42:22,100 --> 02:42:26,658
up and you run that through the plants

4640
02:42:24,049 --> 02:42:28,609
this will clean out the soil that is our

4641
02:42:26,658 --> 02:42:30,139
main goal as that's happening we're

4642
02:42:28,609 --> 02:42:32,270
gonna see colors changing we're gonna

4643
02:42:30,139 --> 02:42:34,398
see trichomes ripening we're gonna see

4644
02:42:32,270 --> 02:42:36,799
plants finishing up now you're gonna get

4645
02:42:34,398 --> 02:42:38,269
a bunch of funky you may I'm not

4646
02:42:36,799 --> 02:42:39,829
promising it depends on your genetics

4647
02:42:38,270 --> 02:42:42,498
your environment it depends on a lot of

4648
02:42:39,828 --> 02:42:44,600
things you're going to get funky yellow

4649
02:42:42,498 --> 02:42:47,779
leaves you're gonna get dead foliage

4650
02:42:44,600 --> 02:42:49,279
pull that stuff off there's no problem

4651
02:42:47,779 --> 02:42:50,689
with just yanking that dead stuff off

4652
02:42:49,279 --> 02:42:52,220
make sure you throw it away get it out

4653
02:42:50,689 --> 02:42:54,799
of the grow room but just pull all that

4654
02:42:52,219 --> 02:42:57,438
dead stuff off and throw it away now

4655
02:42:54,799 --> 02:42:59,180
about a week maybe five or three days

4656
02:42:57,439 --> 02:43:01,010
before you harvest go in the grow room

4657
02:42:59,180 --> 02:43:03,049
and to start stripping off all the big

4658
02:43:01,010 --> 02:43:04,939
leaves this is going to save you a lot

4659
02:43:03,049 --> 02:43:07,100
of time when it does come time to

4660
02:43:04,939 --> 02:43:08,869
harvest there won't be all these big

4661
02:43:07,100 --> 02:43:10,488
giant leaves in your way just cut them

4662
02:43:08,869 --> 02:43:11,989
off while the plant is standing up while

4663
02:43:10,488 --> 02:43:13,478
they're still stiff while they're still

4664
02:43:11,988 --> 02:43:15,648
alive you can just snap them right off

4665
02:43:13,478 --> 02:43:17,358
you can go really fast you don't even

4666
02:43:15,648 --> 02:43:18,798
need scissors for it once you get the

4667
02:43:17,359 --> 02:43:20,149
thumb technique you just pop in a leaf

4668
02:43:18,799 --> 02:43:22,459
off you can just go in there and

4669
02:43:20,148 --> 02:43:25,038
defoliate a whole section really quickly

4670
02:43:22,459 --> 02:43:27,109
so a few days before harvest go in there

4671
02:43:25,039 --> 02:43:28,909
and pull off all those big leaves and

4672
02:43:27,109 --> 02:43:30,979
that will save you a big headache and a

4673
02:43:28,908 --> 02:43:32,838
bunch of time when it comes time to

4674
02:43:30,978 --> 02:43:34,488
harvest the plants you hang them upside

4675
02:43:32,838 --> 02:43:36,798
down dry and cured when it comes time to

4676
02:43:34,488 --> 02:43:39,139
trim half the leaves are already gone it

4677
02:43:36,799 --> 02:43:40,879
will save you a lot of [ __ ] and a

4678
02:43:39,139 --> 02:43:42,588
lot of trouble so what do you see them

4679
02:43:40,879 --> 02:43:45,529
starting to get funky take off the dead

4680
02:43:42,588 --> 02:43:46,110
ones then just a few days before harvest

4681
02:43:45,529 --> 02:43:48,601
problem

4682
02:43:46,110 --> 02:43:49,829
when you cut out the shine maybe then go

4683
02:43:48,601 --> 02:43:52,079
in there and start pulling off the

4684
02:43:49,829 --> 02:43:53,789
leaves now another thing you might want

4685
02:43:52,079 --> 02:43:56,819
to do is you might want to reduce the

4686
02:43:53,790 --> 02:43:59,341
temperature just a few degrees do not

4687
02:43:56,819 --> 02:44:03,149
create a large swing and temps between

4688
02:43:59,341 --> 02:44:05,460
your day and night do not go too cold at

4689
02:44:03,149 --> 02:44:07,890
night do not try to create something

4690
02:44:05,459 --> 02:44:09,779
drastic if you can bring it down two or

4691
02:44:07,890 --> 02:44:11,819
three degrees during the day and two or

4692
02:44:09,780 --> 02:44:14,159
three degrees during the night do that

4693
02:44:11,819 --> 02:44:15,750
but don't go crazy you guys don't shock

4694
02:44:14,159 --> 02:44:17,399
the plants right at the end don't give

4695
02:44:15,750 --> 02:44:19,379
yourself powdery mildew right at the end

4696
02:44:17,399 --> 02:44:20,850
just try to mimic nature and get a

4697
02:44:19,379 --> 02:44:22,770
little bit colder right at the end

4698
02:44:20,851 --> 02:44:24,120
because what happens right at the end of

4699
02:44:22,771 --> 02:44:25,950
the season it gets cold that's how

4700
02:44:24,120 --> 02:44:27,570
things know oh [ __ ] it's wintertime and

4701
02:44:25,950 --> 02:44:29,101
those plants will hurry up and finish so

4702
02:44:27,569 --> 02:44:31,079
you'll see more color you may get a

4703
02:44:29,101 --> 02:44:33,989
little more density and cool temps are

4704
02:44:31,079 --> 02:44:35,459
good for terpenes so lower the

4705
02:44:33,989 --> 02:44:38,039
temperatures a little bit right at the

4706
02:44:35,459 --> 02:44:39,810
end now one thing I'm sure people are

4707
02:44:38,040 --> 02:44:43,230
going to send me messages about and ask

4708
02:44:39,810 --> 02:44:45,329
is do I use any flushing agents no I do

4709
02:44:43,229 --> 02:44:48,209
not use a flushing agent I think all of

4710
02:44:45,329 --> 02:44:50,431
the flushing agents are kind of a sales

4711
02:44:48,209 --> 02:44:51,989
tactic they are not necessary and I

4712
02:44:50,431 --> 02:44:55,051
think they make your herb taste like

4713
02:44:51,989 --> 02:44:56,970
whatever they taste like it's the very

4714
02:44:55,050 --> 02:44:59,250
end why would I want to put in a new

4715
02:44:56,970 --> 02:45:01,560
ingredient I want to get everything out

4716
02:44:59,250 --> 02:45:03,659
so I do not use a flushing agent if I

4717
02:45:01,560 --> 02:45:06,479
were to use anything I would just use

4718
02:45:03,659 --> 02:45:08,310
the solution I told you the enzymes in

4719
02:45:06,479 --> 02:45:10,680
the shine and then I would add powdered

4720
02:45:08,310 --> 02:45:12,511
coconut water would be the only flushing

4721
02:45:10,681 --> 02:45:14,310
solution that I would use and a lot of

4722
02:45:12,511 --> 02:45:16,170
people are saying what yea coconut water

4723
02:45:14,310 --> 02:45:17,909
would be ideal but that would get very

4724
02:45:16,170 --> 02:45:19,500
expensive to buy it have that much

4725
02:45:17,909 --> 02:45:21,271
coconut water imagine trying to get a

4726
02:45:19,500 --> 02:45:23,909
five gallon bucket of coconut water

4727
02:45:21,271 --> 02:45:27,000
shipped to your house every three days

4728
02:45:23,909 --> 02:45:28,800
for 14 days that's gonna add up it's

4729
02:45:27,000 --> 02:45:31,500
gonna get real expensive but you can buy

4730
02:45:28,800 --> 02:45:33,149
powdered coconut water it is readily

4731
02:45:31,500 --> 02:45:35,431
available from a lot of gross stores

4732
02:45:33,149 --> 02:45:36,959
bill the soil can take good care of you

4733
02:45:35,431 --> 02:45:38,460
they do not sponsor the show or anything

4734
02:45:36,959 --> 02:45:41,489
but I know that that's a reliable source

4735
02:45:38,459 --> 02:45:43,680
for powdered coconut water also

4736
02:45:41,489 --> 02:45:45,300
something I should mention a lot of

4737
02:45:43,681 --> 02:45:48,120
people are growing no-till a lot of

4738
02:45:45,300 --> 02:45:51,930
people are growing in living soil or

4739
02:45:48,120 --> 02:45:53,370
super soil or some sort of live soil you

4740
02:45:51,931 --> 02:45:55,890
guys if that is what you're working with

4741
02:45:53,370 --> 02:45:57,771
you probably do not need to flush

4742
02:45:55,890 --> 02:45:59,430
because you have created the perfect

4743
02:45:57,771 --> 02:46:01,409
environment inside

4744
02:45:59,430 --> 02:46:03,029
plants rhizosphere tor it's taking up

4745
02:46:01,409 --> 02:46:04,318
what it needs you're not feeding it

4746
02:46:03,029 --> 02:46:05,819
bottled nutrients it's not being

4747
02:46:04,318 --> 02:46:08,189
force-fed [ __ ] so it doesn't need to be

4748
02:46:05,818 --> 02:46:09,510
flushed anything our buddies sub cool

4749
02:46:08,189 --> 02:46:11,520
when he would mix up a batch of super

4750
02:46:09,510 --> 02:46:12,988
soil and put a plant in there he would

4751
02:46:11,520 --> 02:46:14,579
just feed it water for the whole

4752
02:46:12,988 --> 02:46:17,549
flowering phase and he would say I've

4753
02:46:14,579 --> 02:46:19,590
been flushing the entire time so before

4754
02:46:17,549 --> 02:46:21,659
people started sending me emails yes

4755
02:46:19,590 --> 02:46:23,040
there are some situations where you may

4756
02:46:21,659 --> 02:46:25,049
not need to flush if you were going

4757
02:46:23,040 --> 02:46:27,270
no-till if you're going all organic

4758
02:46:25,049 --> 02:46:29,309
flushing is not a thing now

4759
02:46:27,270 --> 02:46:31,140
if you're running that you're already up

4760
02:46:29,309 --> 02:46:32,909
to speed and you know that we don't need

4761
02:46:31,139 --> 02:46:35,039
to teach you about flushing you were in

4762
02:46:32,909 --> 02:46:36,750
the advanced blackbelt class already

4763
02:46:35,040 --> 02:46:38,970
I've got one more thing I should mention

4764
02:46:36,750 --> 02:46:40,559
before I wrap up this so called quickie

4765
02:46:38,969 --> 02:46:41,698
episode that's gone on for 20 minutes

4766
02:46:40,559 --> 02:46:42,318
you guys are very welcome thank you for

4767
02:46:41,699 --> 02:46:46,800
listening

4768
02:46:42,318 --> 02:46:50,189
good thing to do is to measure the EC or

4769
02:46:46,799 --> 02:46:51,389
the ppm of your runoff water you are

4770
02:46:50,189 --> 02:46:53,699
pouring a bunch of water into your

4771
02:46:51,389 --> 02:46:54,778
plants right collect it collect the

4772
02:46:53,699 --> 02:46:56,189
water that comes out of the bottom of

4773
02:46:54,779 --> 02:46:59,069
your plant into some sort of a vessel

4774
02:46:56,189 --> 02:47:02,460
put your pH pen in there put your EC or

4775
02:46:59,068 --> 02:47:04,379
ppm pen in there and see what the EC is

4776
02:47:02,459 --> 02:47:06,329
now if you're in a soil or a soilless

4777
02:47:04,379 --> 02:47:08,759
mix you're only gonna get down so low if

4778
02:47:06,329 --> 02:47:10,949
you're in cocoa you can get those PPM's

4779
02:47:08,760 --> 02:47:12,930
down really really low see how low you

4780
02:47:10,949 --> 02:47:16,050
can get it maybe before you start

4781
02:47:12,930 --> 02:47:18,120
flushing that day the first day you

4782
02:47:16,049 --> 02:47:19,920
flush measure what comes out then

4783
02:47:18,120 --> 02:47:21,000
measure each time and see how low you

4784
02:47:19,920 --> 02:47:22,889
could get it and then just keep

4785
02:47:21,000 --> 02:47:25,079
experimenting see how low it goes every

4786
02:47:22,889 --> 02:47:26,398
day and see how low you can get the ppm

4787
02:47:25,079 --> 02:47:27,959
s I don't want to give any

4788
02:47:26,398 --> 02:47:29,670
recommendations on how low to try and

4789
02:47:27,959 --> 02:47:31,379
get it because it's going to vary based

4790
02:47:29,670 --> 02:47:33,148
on your medium and I don't want to [ __ ]

4791
02:47:31,379 --> 02:47:34,799
up your Gro you're going to have to

4792
02:47:33,148 --> 02:47:36,448
learn this based on your grow cocoa

4793
02:47:34,799 --> 02:47:38,759
you'll get it really low because cocoa

4794
02:47:36,449 --> 02:47:40,470
is inert cocoa is not gonna hold [ __ ]

4795
02:47:38,760 --> 02:47:41,939
same thing with rock wool you'll be able

4796
02:47:40,469 --> 02:47:44,429
to get the PPM's of your rock wool and

4797
02:47:41,939 --> 02:47:46,648
your cocoa down to amazingly low levels

4798
02:47:44,430 --> 02:47:48,630
soil soilless mixes those are still

4799
02:47:46,648 --> 02:47:50,818
gonna have some high PPM's because they

4800
02:47:48,629 --> 02:47:53,039
are soil and soilless mixes there's just

4801
02:47:50,818 --> 02:47:55,019
a lot of [ __ ] in there but play with

4802
02:47:53,040 --> 02:47:56,580
your runoff pay attention to that see

4803
02:47:55,020 --> 02:47:58,409
how low you can get it and it'll be a

4804
02:47:56,579 --> 02:48:00,359
lot of fun it'll be a fun experiment and

4805
02:47:58,409 --> 02:48:01,770
then you'll actually see what's going in

4806
02:48:00,359 --> 02:48:03,180
and what's coming out of your plants

4807
02:48:01,770 --> 02:48:05,279
maybe we should just talk about

4808
02:48:03,180 --> 02:48:07,500
measuring runoff anyway in a full

4809
02:48:05,279 --> 02:48:09,329
episode we'll talk about checking the EC

4810
02:48:07,500 --> 02:48:10,770
or the PPM's of a solution before you

4811
02:48:09,329 --> 02:48:13,190
pour it into your plants and then we'll

4812
02:48:10,770 --> 02:48:15,351
remesh that same solution the EC

4813
02:48:13,190 --> 02:48:17,030
the peope PPM's when it comes out of the

4814
02:48:15,351 --> 02:48:18,891
bottom of your plants and we'll compare

4815
02:48:17,030 --> 02:48:20,391
that to the ph going in and the ph

4816
02:48:18,890 --> 02:48:21,709
coming out and we'll see what's

4817
02:48:20,390 --> 02:48:24,229
happening in your rhizosphere

4818
02:48:21,709 --> 02:48:26,539
anyway that's a future episode I'm just

4819
02:48:24,229 --> 02:48:28,430
getting excited you guys measure the

4820
02:48:26,540 --> 02:48:30,171
electrical conductivity or the particles

4821
02:48:28,431 --> 02:48:32,120
per million of what's coming out of your

4822
02:48:30,171 --> 02:48:34,101
plant and you will know if you need to

4823
02:48:32,120 --> 02:48:36,051
flush more or not and then when you cut

4824
02:48:34,101 --> 02:48:37,370
it down right down the ppm s and then

4825
02:48:36,050 --> 02:48:39,649
pay attention and then if you are

4826
02:48:37,370 --> 02:48:41,120
satisfied hit that number next time if

4827
02:48:39,649 --> 02:48:42,800
you're not satisfied maybe flush a

4828
02:48:41,120 --> 02:48:44,811
little longer and try to go lower but

4829
02:48:42,800 --> 02:48:46,760
they'll be discouraged because it's not

4830
02:48:44,810 --> 02:48:48,380
all about the flush you still have dry

4831
02:48:46,761 --> 02:48:50,841
and cure to [ __ ] this up you could ruin

4832
02:48:48,380 --> 02:48:52,250
your whole crop after you cut it down so

4833
02:48:50,841 --> 02:48:54,829
ladies and gentlemen I want to thank you

4834
02:48:52,250 --> 02:48:57,341
for listening to my flushing episode so

4835
02:48:54,829 --> 02:48:59,601
so far we have done determining ripeness

4836
02:48:57,341 --> 02:49:01,851
determining when to flush we've talked

4837
02:48:59,601 --> 02:49:04,579
about flushing I think the next episode

4838
02:49:01,851 --> 02:49:07,101
in line is harvesting and then after

4839
02:49:04,579 --> 02:49:08,000
that we're going to do the dry and pure

4840
02:49:07,101 --> 02:49:09,641
episodes there will be some

4841
02:49:08,000 --> 02:49:11,959
interruptions to that schedule because

4842
02:49:09,640 --> 02:49:14,779
scheduled with some friends and things

4843
02:49:11,959 --> 02:49:16,909
always pop up but those are on the chart

4844
02:49:14,780 --> 02:49:18,320
to come up in order ladies and gentlemen

4845
02:49:16,909 --> 02:49:20,091

for payments or contributions or

4859
02:49:41,870 --> 02:49:46,280
anything I will do this podcast for ever

4860
02:49:43,819 --> 02:49:47,959
for free I'm really not trying to get

4861
02:49:46,280 --> 02:49:49,311
rich off of podcasting but there are a

4862
02:49:47,959 --> 02:49:51,409
few people who said they would like to

4863
02:49:49,310 --> 02:49:53,360
contribute to the podcast I'd like to

4864
02:49:51,409 --> 02:49:56,569
make sure there is an opportunity for

4865
02:49:53,360 --> 02:49:57,921
that it is patreon.com slash grow from

4866
02:49:56,569 --> 02:49:59,659
your heart what I will do with those

4867
02:49:57,921 --> 02:50:02,030
funds is I will pay for my website

4868
02:49:59,659 --> 02:50:04,159
you guys I host this podcast on my

4869
02:50:02,030 --> 02:50:05,120
website it costs a little bit of money

4870
02:50:04,159 --> 02:50:07,369
to do that every year

4871
02:50:05,120 --> 02:50:09,829
also I purchased a better MacBook so

4872
02:50:07,370 --> 02:50:11,960
that I can record more efficiently my

4873
02:50:09,829 --> 02:50:13,310
old computer was not efficient is the

4874
02:50:11,959 --> 02:50:14,750
polite way to say it but the

4875
02:50:13,310 --> 02:50:16,489
contributions will help to go pay for

4876
02:50:14,750 --> 02:50:18,620
the MacBook that I bought and also cover

4877
02:50:16,489 --> 02:50:19,671
the cost of the website also you may

4878
02:50:18,620 --> 02:50:20,931
have heard Mike mentioned that the

4879
02:50:19,671 --> 02:50:23,421
little microphone cover needed a

4880
02:50:20,931 --> 02:50:25,579
replacement I use the funding for things

4881
02:50:23,421 --> 02:50:27,079
like that so if you'd like to contribute

4882
02:50:25,579 --> 02:50:29,629
I would appreciate it I will quit

4883
02:50:27,079 --> 02:50:31,219
because that got uncomfortable quite

4884
02:50:29,629 --> 02:50:32,569
quickly ladies and gentlemen I would

4885
02:50:31,219 --> 02:50:34,189
love it if you would stop me on all of

4886

Eirene or genetics on Instagram I like

4896
02:50:52,340 --> 02:50:56,090
to do live feeds where I go on Instagram

4897
02:50:54,079 --> 02:50:58,100
live and I hang out take a couple of

4898
02:50:56,090 --> 02:51:00,079
dads and then I take questions from the

4899
02:50:58,100 --> 02:51:01,940
Instagram live feed and I will rant

4900
02:51:00,079 --> 02:51:03,860
about your question and teach you how to

4901
02:51:01,940 --> 02:51:05,630
grow cannabis right there on the spot I

4902
02:51:03,860 --> 02:51:07,730
think it's fun because there's no notes

4903
02:51:05,629 --> 02:51:09,500
there's no preparation today's somebody

4904
02:51:07,729 --> 02:51:11,090
asked me a fairly in-depth question and

4905
02:51:09,500 --> 02:51:12,409
I had to stare into the sky and wall my

4906
02:51:11,090 --> 02:51:14,899
eyes for about two minutes and try to

4907
02:51:12,409 --> 02:51:16,909
bored out the reply I was trying to give

4908
02:51:14,899 --> 02:51:18,529
them because I wasn't prepared and it's

4909
02:51:16,909 --> 02:51:20,180
really a lot of fun for me it's kind of

4910
02:51:18,530 --> 02:51:22,550
like it's like a game of stump the

4911
02:51:20,180 --> 02:51:24,229
grower or stump the breeder or something

4912
02:51:22,549 --> 02:51:25,939
like that and I really find it it's good

4913
02:51:24,229 --> 02:51:28,369
for my brain it keeps my brain going it

4914
02:51:25,940 --> 02:51:30,079
keeps my growth knowledge on the tip of

4915
02:51:28,370 --> 02:51:31,311
my tongue and it keeps my brain active

4916
02:51:30,079 --> 02:51:33,319
you guys know that I had a brain injury

4917
02:51:31,310 --> 02:51:34,670
a few years ago so I like to do things

4918
02:51:33,319 --> 02:51:38,209
to keep my brain going the right

4919
02:51:34,670 --> 02:51:39,739
direction anyway I'm [ __ ] ranting

4920
02:51:38,209 --> 02:51:42,109
today you guys who needs a quick episode

4921
02:51:39,739 --> 02:51:44,060

also why wouldn't you want to check out

4924
02:51:45,889 --> 02:51:48,949
some dope-ass cannabis photography go

02:51:48,139 --> 02:51:51,529
check it out

4926
02:51:48,950 --> 02:51:53,360
also you guys one more thing YouTube

4927
02:51:51,530 --> 02:51:55,850
I've got all of the videos up on YouTube

4928
02:51:53,360 --> 02:51:58,100
you can find every episode as the growth

4929
02:51:55,850 --> 02:52:00,290
of our podcast on YouTube now hopefully

4930
02:51:58,100 --> 02:52:01,610
we're able to get a larger audience we

4931
02:52:00,290 --> 02:52:03,260
could reach more people we can teach

4932
02:52:01,610 --> 02:52:05,300
more people how to grow better cannabis

4933
02:52:03,260 --> 02:52:07,489
you can dispel more myths we can educate

4934
02:52:05,299 --> 02:52:08,929
more people by having another platform

4935
02:52:07,489 --> 02:52:11,149
so make sure you support the YouTube

4936
02:52:08,930 --> 02:52:13,040
channel go click subscribe go like some

4937
02:52:11,149 --> 02:52:15,229

4945
