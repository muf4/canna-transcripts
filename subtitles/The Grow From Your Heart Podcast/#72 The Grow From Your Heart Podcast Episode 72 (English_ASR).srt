light would be in their

179
00:06:02,918 --> 00:06:06,639
situation right now the light I would

180
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:09,079
recommend would be a gavita for almost

181
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,680
any situation uh other than like a tent

182
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:12,839
if you've got a room and you're trying

183
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,360
to put new lights in there go gavitas

184
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:16,679
those are sweet the double-ended bulb

Department of Public Health and

Physicians making medical marijuana

366
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:30,078
recommendations the provision is backed

367
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:32,320
by those like agular who doubt that most

368
00:12:30,078 --> 00:12:34,039
medical marijuana card holders receiving

369
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,160
recommendations for treatment of severe

370
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:39,039
pain a group that makes up approximately

371
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:41,600
93% of the total actually suffer from

372
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:43,439
this condition now we'll we'll take a

373
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,320
minute to [ __ ] about this there's a

374
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:49,920
there's a lot of stuff in there I first

375
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:52,879
the 93% of Colorado medical marijuana

376
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:56,679
card holders list chronic and severe

377
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:58,519
pain as one of their qualifying

378
00:12:56,679 --> 00:13:01,239
conditions if you add all of the

379
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:03,399
qualifying conditions up you get way

380
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:06,240
more than 100% And it's because a lot of

381
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:08,679
people list that along with cancer AIDS

382
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:12,039
Ms the cheia is one of the major ones

383
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:13,958
right Crohn's there's countless um other

384
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:17,159
ailments on the list of qualifying

385
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:18,439
conditions that cause severe pain and so

386
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:20,799
pretty much everyone with a medical

387
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:22,240
marijuana card in Colorado also includes

388
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:25,559
severe pain when they're signing up with

389
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:28,759
their doctor what the legislature's done

390
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:31,799
and uh the theory I guess for several

391
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:33,039
years is has been that that 97% number

392
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:35,278
is the

393
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:38,278
fakers and so

394
00:13:35,278 --> 00:13:40,720
when I don't know when people I suppose

395
00:13:38,278 --> 00:13:42,320
Park in outside dispensaries across the

396
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,320
street and watch people come and go

397
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,399
every day like there were all kinds of

398
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,680
people claiming they did this regularly

399
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,600
right after we legalized in right after

400
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:52,519
the medical expansion you can't tell

401
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:55,000
what's wrong with me by the way I walk

402
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:58,078
from my car to the dispensary you can't

403
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,519
see my nerve damage from 20 yards away

404
00:13:58,078 --> 00:14:02,278
you can't see that yeah I don't even

405
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,560
need to talk it's I don't I I have

406
00:14:02,278 --> 00:14:06,519
plenty of medical conditions we could

407
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:08,198
talk about uh my pain is one of them but

408
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:09,600
it's I shouldn't even have to say what's

409
00:14:08,198 --> 00:14:11,278
wrong with me I've got a medical

410
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,440
marijuana card and it's really not that

411
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:16,198
detective or that nosy person's business

412
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:19,320
what my problem is right so the these

413
00:14:16,198 --> 00:14:21,838
people have decided that that 97% number

414
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:25,079
is probably all of the fakers in

415
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:27,680
Colorado which is like 97,000 people cuz

416
00:14:25,078 --> 00:14:30,399
there's roughly 100,000 people on the

417
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:33,039
registry right now wow so they're

418
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:36,278
assuming roughly 97,000 people are

419
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:38,240
basically faking and uh this bill is a

420
00:14:36,278 --> 00:14:40,399
big attempt to push as many of them as

421
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,120
they can back into the re uh the wreck

422
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,000
Market where we're paying let me jump

423
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,879
more more taxes yeah let me get into the

424
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,240
article because you're going to blow

425
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:47,838
this guy's whole paper this guy wrote an

426
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,519
article and you just [ __ ] shot it all

427
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:50,800
down for him you just you just buried

428
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:53,240
the lead for this guy that took time

429
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:55,240
onto this article no uh it says but is

430
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:57,959
this new rule more about safety or money

431
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:59,720
even though uh 15-14 is now law the

432
00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:01,599
debate continues to rise page the

433
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:03,680
highest profile backer of the bill was

434
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,278
Senator Irene agular whose website lists

435
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:09,919
her as Senator Irene agular MD and

436
00:15:06,278 --> 00:15:11,799
stresses her own medical background so

437
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:13,799
what Mike was getting at is they're

438
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:17,319
trying to make it harder for you to get

439
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:19,838
a medical marijuana card for your pain

440
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:22,278
and we suspect that it's to drive you to

441
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:24,160
the recreational dispensaries where

442
00:15:22,278 --> 00:15:25,799
taxes are higher and you've got to spend

443
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:27,879
more money and pay more taxes and the

444
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:29,479
state makes more money because a lot of

445
00:15:27,879 --> 00:15:31,958
the things that we see going on in this

446
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:33,360
bill are all about the taxes and the

447
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:35,599
money and [ __ ] the patients and the

448
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,959
caregivers yeah this is a long Bill and

449
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,120
it does several things and I think if

450
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:41,838
you take a look at it as a whole all of

451
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:43,480
the things it does are designed to push

452
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:45,560
people off of the medical registry and

453
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:47,639
into the wck market the next paragraph

454
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:49,479
in this article just uh is an excerpt

455
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:51,720
from this lady's website and basically

456
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,879
it brags and says I'm too cool for you

457
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,480
it talks about all the places she went

458
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:56,958
to school and her qualifications you

459
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:59,120
guys don't care uh then it goes on to

460
00:15:56,958 --> 00:16:00,679
say uh will the Bill's new guidelines

461
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,278
make it more difficult for Physicians to

462
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:04,439
recommend medical marijuana to those who

463
00:16:02,278 --> 00:16:07,240
say they are plagued by severe pain if

464
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:09,399
so longtime Westward uh marijuana writer

465
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:12,120
William breeds fears some patients who

466
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:13,759
really need MMJ will be deprived of the

467
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:15,879
recommendations and then here's an

468
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:18,720
excerpt from another uh article he wrote

469
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:20,679
in March that says studies show that as

470
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,120
many as 100 million Americans suffer

471
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:25,120
from chronic pain and that it affects

472
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,639
more people than diabetes coronary heart

473
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,799
disease and cancer combined according to

474
00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:32,159
the American Academy of pain medicine

475
00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:34,198
20% of All American adults experience

476
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:36,439
chronic pain severe enough to disrupt

477
00:16:34,198 --> 00:16:38,039
their sleep at least two times per week

478
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:40,079
the number of patients on the Colorado

479
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:42,639
medical marijuana registry who claim

480
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:46,120
severe pain is around 10

481
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:48,560
15,500 people just below 2% of the total

482
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:50,839
uh the total population of the state the

483
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:52,559
fact that 1.9% of the state's residents

484
00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:54,839
experience chronic pain and have turned

485
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:58,679
to cannabis to help is hardly surprising

486
00:16:54,839 --> 00:17:00,480
or shocking so breeds also notes excuse

487
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:02,198
me uh Breeze also notes that the

488
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,360
assorted lawmakers in favor of the

489
00:17:02,198 --> 00:17:06,438
proposal have made it clear that the

490
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:08,318
measure is a way to improve some medical

491
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:10,439
marijuana paat oh sorry I read that

492
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:12,519
wrong a way to move some medical

493
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:14,199
marijuana patients into recreational pot

494
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:15,959
sales which are taxed at higher rates

495
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:18,360
than medical pot sales in order to

496
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:20,199
generate valuable tax revenue for state

497
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:21,599
and local governments the difference

498
00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:23,759
between the amount of tax revenue

499
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:26,240
generated by the recreational marijuana

500
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:28,160
versus medical cannabis are Stark as we

501
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,798
pointed out last week in a post about

502
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,600
recot so yeah they did we talked about

503
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:34,519
how much of the taxes are then they show

504
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:36,719
a graph here that shows state of

505
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:40,038
Colorado medical marijuana sales tax for

506
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:42,279
the month of March and then it shows

507
00:17:40,038 --> 00:17:44,240
this is Medical in Adams County let's

508
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:48,240
see let's find pbl this is where we are

509
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,240
let's go to peblo they did

510
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:03,600
[Music]

511
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:03,599
$4,940 10% sales tax brought in

512
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:15,279
$135,200

513
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:16,679
yep oh that's rude that's a dick move

514
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:19,319
they were working on this three years

515
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:22,159
ago and then they sort of dropped it

516
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:23,359
last year and the hype was that a whole

517
00:18:22,159 --> 00:18:25,200
bunch of people were going to join the

518
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:27,439
medical marijuana registry to avoid the

519
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,440
taxes and when that didn't happen they

520
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,759
brought up the severe pain number again

521
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,880
and said well let's push more of those

522
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:35,519
people out why don't yeah it's part of

523
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:37,440
the data collection when they saw that

524
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:40,960
the medical marijuana Market consumed

525
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:43,759
like 65 or 70% of the $700 Million worth

526
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:45,558
of marijuana sold in Colorado last year

527
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:48,359
they kind of freaked what they don't get

528
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:50,359
is that wck consumers consume

529
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:52,000
occasionally recreationally medical

530
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:53,558
consumers consume daily for medical

531
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,839
reasons of course we're consuming the

532
00:18:53,558 --> 00:18:58,158
majority of the meds yeah and that's

533
00:18:55,839 --> 00:19:00,918
what this was designed for that's I keep

534
00:18:58,159 --> 00:19:02,480
going back to this part but we' put

535
00:19:00,919 --> 00:19:04,240
cannabis on the legal Market here for

536
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,679
medical patients that's how the model

537
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,640
started and now that's who we have

538
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:09,280
screwed over that's who's getting pushed

539
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:11,559
right out of all of this and that that

540
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:13,279
sus attacked from every angle the

541
00:19:11,558 --> 00:19:14,759
state's taking money out of the registry

542
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:15,960
that they're not supposed to access and

543
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:18,079
spending it on stuff they're not

544
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:19,600
supposed to spend it on they're M

545
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:22,399
looking to make it harder to get a

546
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:24,639
extended plant count to get a a

547
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,640
recommendation for severe pain they're

548
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,880
looking to limit caregivers in a half

549
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,120
dozen different ways we're going to talk

550
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:31,679
about in a little bit yeah we'll talk

551
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:33,319
about that in just a second it's getting

552
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,159
tough to be a medical patient in

553
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:36,359
Colorado if you don't really keep up on

554
00:19:35,159 --> 00:19:38,280
your stuff and it's going to be

555
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:39,759
especially harder to be a caregiver here

556
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:41,240
pretty soon all right I've got another

557
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:42,480
article on the screen it's very similar

558
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:44,000
to the one that we just read but it goes

559
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,960
on a different direction toward the end

560
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,159
it says it's about the same law it's

561
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:49,558
just such a big law that it's you know

562
00:19:48,159 --> 00:19:50,520
there's several different news articles

563
00:19:49,558 --> 00:19:53,079
yeah and then we're going to read part

564
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:54,798
of the new bill uh actually I have the

565
00:19:53,079 --> 00:19:56,199
PDF on my screen we'll read part of that

566
00:19:54,798 --> 00:19:57,679
bill in just a minute too and the

567
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,319
headline alone will be enough to make

568
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:01,480
you understand why we're so frustrated

569
00:19:59,319 --> 00:20:03,000
and we'll read some parts from that bill

570
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:04,919
so it says this article is actually

571
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,558
written by Kristen Wyatt and I found it

572
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:07,880
on the Cannabis I think Mike sent me a

573
00:20:06,558 --> 00:20:09,839
link to this thanks for that that's why

574
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:11,760
I called you to be on the show thanks uh

575
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:14,240
the headline is Colorado medical pot new

576
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:16,400
caregiver limits MMJ and schools okayed

577
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,480
by government what yeah I'll read it

578
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,200
don't worry it says Colorado's Governor

579
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,400
signed into law a Crackdown on medical

580
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:23,880
marijuana

581
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:26,080
Mona that's a [ __ ] tongue twister

582
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:27,679
medical marijuana Monday that's a whole

583
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:29,319
new we should just make that something

584
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:30,640
right there medical marijuana Mondays I

585
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:32,558
like that I'm going to start over though

586
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,799
Colorado's Governor signed into law a

587
00:20:32,558 --> 00:20:37,038
Crackdown on medical marijuana Monday

588
00:20:34,798 --> 00:20:38,759
one of two measures designed to fit out

589
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:41,000
people improperly using and selling

590
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:42,759
untaxed marijuana I think that we need

591
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
an Oxford comma in this sentence right

592
00:20:42,759 --> 00:20:46,599
here after the word marijuana I think

593
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,359
that would fix this I'm the wrong guy to

594
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:50,199
ask that question but then it says the

595
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:52,798
law limits caregivers those who grow pot

596
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:54,279
on behalf of patients to 99 plants the

597
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:56,038
change means that some high volume

598
00:20:54,279 --> 00:20:58,079
caregivers will face the same oversight

599
00:20:56,038 --> 00:21:00,879
as commercial Growers paying licensing

600
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:03,519
fees and under growing background checks

601
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,799
the new rule in Senate 14 uh Senate bill

602
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:07,200
14 have support from the recreational

603
00:21:05,798 --> 00:21:08,720
pot industry which is complained that

604
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,679
the light regulation on Colorado's

605
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,400
caregivers has invited Black Market

606
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:14,320
Growers who don't face residency

607
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,759
requirements background checks or

608
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:19,359
commercial seed to sale tracking used to

609
00:21:16,759 --> 00:21:23,038
ensure pot plants are grown and sold

610
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:25,479
legally um a lot of those people just

611
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:27,640
have to grow cannabis either way like

612
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:31,720
they're going to grow their own Black

613
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:33,799
Market production people just do they

614
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:35,440
they have forever yeah they're if

615
00:21:33,798 --> 00:21:37,200
they're moving here to Colorado it's to

616
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,919
hide amongst the many like those idiots

617
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,759
doing those warehouses in Denver but

618
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:43,880
they stood out like a sore thumb because

619
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:45,359
they weren't operating legally and it

620
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,840
was clear to everyone around them that

621
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:49,158
they were about to get busted and then

622
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:51,439
they were quickly

623
00:21:49,159 --> 00:21:54,039
busted there's so many things I want to

624
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,278
rant about here at least they one thing

625
00:21:54,038 --> 00:21:57,919
that they did that was cool is they left

626
00:21:55,278 --> 00:21:59,038
it at 99 plants uh if you've got more

627
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:01,840
than that you're doing something weird

628
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:03,400
anyway but fees and background checks we

629
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:05,359
would open our own dispensary if we

630
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,960
wanted background checks and fees that's

631
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:08,678
why we're just a caregiver we're just

632
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:11,679
lowkey growing a little bit of cannabis

633
00:22:08,679 --> 00:22:14,559
for somebody well dispensaries uh make

634
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:15,960
money caregivers can't and yeah part of

635
00:22:14,558 --> 00:22:17,399
the beauty of the caregiver system is

636
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:19,480
there's a huge number of people in

637
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:23,360
Colorado that can't afford to be

638
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:25,038
spending $400 or $500 a week on medicine

639
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:27,558
and without caregivers I don't know a

640
00:22:25,038 --> 00:22:29,038
lot of people that could ma manage their

641
00:22:27,558 --> 00:22:30,278
pain yeah I know several people that

642
00:22:29,038 --> 00:22:31,960
would be [ __ ] out of luck if I couldn't

643
00:22:30,278 --> 00:22:33,480
grow their medicine for them or some

644
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:36,000
Supply their medicine in some way shape

645
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:37,798
or form yep that's no it's a huge thing

646
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,798
the cost savings when you go through a

647
00:22:37,798 --> 00:22:41,558
caregiver is significant over trying to

648
00:22:39,798 --> 00:22:43,960
shop and even the medical dispensaries

649
00:22:41,558 --> 00:22:45,558
and getting rid of the caregivers pushes

650
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:47,960
more people into the medical legal

651
00:22:45,558 --> 00:22:50,399
system of the shops and I don't know I

652
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:51,600
hate this bill so much me too me too the

653
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,120
article goes on to say we're really

654
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:54,918
trying to make sure that caregivers are

655
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:56,678
part of our regulatory system said

656
00:22:54,919 --> 00:22:58,880
representative Jonathan singer from

657
00:22:56,679 --> 00:23:00,919
Longmont who sponsored the bill

658
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,679
caregivers have successfully resisted

659
00:23:00,919 --> 00:23:04,640
such limits for years but the law

660
00:23:02,679 --> 00:23:06,120
includes some con uh concessions that

661
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,120
won their

662
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:11,000
acceptance for example the law that

663
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:12,798
eliminates an uh an unfor the law

664
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,480
eliminates an unenforced requirement

665
00:23:12,798 --> 00:23:17,558
that parents of marijuana patients under

666
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:19,000
18 grow the drug so that means that now

667
00:23:17,558 --> 00:23:20,319
back in the day if you were under 18 and

668
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,759
you were a patient your parents had to

669
00:23:20,319 --> 00:23:23,079
grow for you you couldn't assign a

670
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:25,240
caregiver you couldn't shop at the

671
00:23:23,079 --> 00:23:27,798
dispensary now that kind of changes the

672
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:29,000
rules there so that kind of helps uh the

673
00:23:27,798 --> 00:23:31,519
rule had

674
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,038
yeah there's two not horrible parts of

675
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:35,158
this bill or you could even call them

676
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:37,359
decent and that's definitely one of them

677
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:38,799
true yeah uh the rule puts some parents

678
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:40,199
who move to Colorado seeking cannabis

679
00:23:38,798 --> 00:23:41,599
treatments for their children outside

680
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,840
the law and now those folks will be

681
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:46,199
legal so that helps a lot uh it also

682
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:48,359
sets up it sets up a task force to start

683
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:51,038
work on public access to the state's few

684
00:23:48,359 --> 00:23:52,798
marijuana testing Labs uh so the

685
00:23:51,038 --> 00:23:54,440
marijuana industry has generally opposed

686
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:56,879
public access to the labs fearing

687
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:58,840
backlogs but that's some horeshit ain't

688
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:01,960
it just let that sentence sck for a

689
00:23:58,839 --> 00:24:04,720
minute the industry is fighting letting

690
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:06,600
caregivers access testing Labs because

691
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,360
it might take them an extra day to get

692
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:11,639
their test

693
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:14,199
results and they don't want business

694
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:15,679
well right why aren't the labs standing

695
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:17,519
up asking for more business it just

696
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:19,038
doesn't make any sense yeah and my

697
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:21,599
medicine needs to be tested just as

698
00:24:19,038 --> 00:24:23,359
badly as the dispensaries does right or

699
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:26,158
whoever else is gr that dumb rule came

700
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:28,798
down what after one batch of tests you

701
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:30,440
got in yeah uh yeah I got one two good

702
00:24:28,798 --> 00:24:31,558
batches of testing in before they shut

703
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:34,240
that down so that I couldn't do it

704
00:24:31,558 --> 00:24:35,359
anymore yep all right uh there's so much

705
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,440
stuff in this article you guys I might

706
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:39,398
skip a couple of paragraphs uh finally

707
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,960
this one is good the law allows school

708
00:24:39,398 --> 00:24:43,158
districts to consider allowing medical

709
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:45,079
marijuana use on campus as long as the

710
00:24:43,159 --> 00:24:46,720
pot is administered by a parent or

711
00:24:45,079 --> 00:24:50,158
designated medical marijuana

712
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:51,600
professional not a school nurse the pot

713
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,720
in school's allowance would be the

714
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:56,000
nation's first though it's not clear how

715
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:58,960
many school districts would participate

716
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:02,000
nor would it allow any sort of

717
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:04,880
smoked consumption it's capsules oils

718
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,558
tinctures lotions only but still it's a

719
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,320
huge step in the right direction yeah

720
00:25:06,558 --> 00:25:11,200
well because a kid that's got add or

721
00:25:09,319 --> 00:25:13,839
whatever else that requires a medicine

722
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,840
there are hundreds of kids go nurse pill

723
00:25:13,839 --> 00:25:16,240
well I'm just saying if you take if you

724
00:25:14,839 --> 00:25:17,639
take a pill if you take a prescription

725
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,159
you go to the school nurse after lunch

726
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,720
and she gives you your pill why can't

727
00:25:19,159 --> 00:25:22,919
you just go in there and get your ganja

728
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:25,600
cookie your sweet Stone candy bear or

729
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:28,520
something they're skirting federal law

730
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:31,079
again and being silly but it's a step in

731
00:25:28,519 --> 00:25:32,679
the right direction at least it's a very

732
00:25:31,079 --> 00:25:34,918
tiny possible step in the right

733
00:25:32,679 --> 00:25:36,399
direction I say small steps baby steps

734
00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:38,120
uh it goes on to say Governor hicken

735
00:25:36,398 --> 00:25:40,398
Looper said the law was a compromise

736
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:43,359
worked out by both political parties and

737
00:25:40,398 --> 00:25:45,519
pot the pot industry and caregivers the

738
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:47,798
news went apeshit with this particular

739
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:50,839
Amendment the last couple of weeks pot

740
00:25:47,798 --> 00:25:53,639
in schools the anti-pot people had a big

741
00:25:50,839 --> 00:25:55,199
H with it too even I'm in the Cannabis

742
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:56,520
industry I've been I've seen this since

743
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,880
the beginning you know we had a shot

744
00:25:56,519 --> 00:25:59,639
Mike was the bud tender and I was the

745
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:02,520
manager at the very first dispensary in

746
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:04,159
this little town and I'm still surprised

747
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:05,960
they're going to let the kids use their

748
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:07,880
Edibles or whatever in school that's

749
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:09,720
just that's revolutionary I we've

750
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:12,480
literally had hundreds of kids move to

751
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:15,278
Colorado to access this is a medication

752
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:17,480
and all of them have to go to school

753
00:26:15,278 --> 00:26:19,960
like it's just one of the things that we

754
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:22,640
need to find a good workaround for I

755
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:23,880
hope this works it's a big step uh it's

756
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,679
a pretty good reflection of what the

757
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:27,120
community wants hick and Looper said if

758
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:28,679
the uh the law doesn't require

759
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:31,038
caregivers to register their growing

760
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:32,679
operations instead it encourages them to

761
00:26:31,038 --> 00:26:34,519
register by assuring them that

762
00:26:32,679 --> 00:26:36,320
authorities could verify their number of

763
00:26:34,519 --> 00:26:37,918
plants without starting a criminal

764
00:26:36,319 --> 00:26:39,879
investigation instead of forcing

765
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:42,679
caregivers to prove in court that their

766
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:44,240
operation is legal that sort of makes

767
00:26:42,679 --> 00:26:46,880
sense but it also

768
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:49,399
seems um haven't we seen this move

769
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:51,080
before like all of you folk of a certain

770
00:26:49,398 --> 00:26:52,599
type need to register so that we know

771
00:26:51,079 --> 00:26:54,639
where all of you are that when we want

772
00:26:52,599 --> 00:26:58,000
to round all of those certain folk up we

773
00:26:54,640 --> 00:27:00,799
know where they are right it's it's a

774
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:04,599
really backwards provision where they're

775
00:27:00,798 --> 00:27:06,918
saying to to keep from looking guilty

776
00:27:04,599 --> 00:27:09,879
stand up and prove your innocent first

777
00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:12,679
right and any caregiver who's operating

778
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:15,120
legally answers the cop at the door with

779
00:27:12,679 --> 00:27:18,080
a binder full of paperwork yeah and if

780
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:19,839
the cop can add there's no difficult

781
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:21,480
questions we're lucky because of where

782
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:23,240
we live the cops will come and they'll

783
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:24,319
say you grow weed here and you go yeah I

784
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,319
got a couple plants and they'll go you

785
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:27,079
got a medical card and you go yeah and

786
00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:29,038
they go okay I've got so much other [ __ ]

787
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:31,558
to do you guys have good day don't stab

788
00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:34,038
anybody then they leave but for people

789
00:27:31,558 --> 00:27:37,000
in other towns yeah that maybe if you've

790
00:27:34,038 --> 00:27:39,278
got if you're uh in like a nice

791
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,640
residential area and you stank it out

792
00:27:39,278 --> 00:27:43,200
maybe it'd be a good idea just to go

793
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:45,120
register just to be proactive now that

794
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,840
this bill has been passed it would be a

795
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:49,518
good idea and they require it if you're

796
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:50,720
doing more than six plant minimums you

797
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:52,519
guys you're going to have to read this

798
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:55,038
bill um yeah if you're a caregiver you

799
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:57,679
need to hop online and download the PDF

800
00:27:55,038 --> 00:27:59,679
of this bill and read every word it's

801
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:01,798
short so don't be intimidated just read

802
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:03,600
it yep just do it get yourself a little

803
00:28:01,798 --> 00:28:06,359
pen and paper make some bullet points of

804
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:07,879
what you've got to do now and so hicken

805
00:28:06,359 --> 00:28:09,479
Looper signed the measure at a Denver

806
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:11,200
Police Station to show Goodwill between

807
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,839
law enforcement and caregivers the

808
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,600
language in the law came after years of

809
00:28:12,839 --> 00:28:17,119
testing negotiations between medical

810
00:28:14,599 --> 00:28:18,959
marijuana groups and police there are

811
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:21,518
good reasons for all sides to not trust

812
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:23,200
each other said Terry robnett uh head of

813
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:25,399
the Cannabis patient Alliance who help

814
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:27,278
negotiate the language the governor has

815
00:28:25,398 --> 00:28:29,719
yet to sign the other medical marijuana

816
00:28:27,278 --> 00:28:31,759
law that measures Upstate that measure

817
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:33,640
updates marijuana regulations that were

818
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:36,519
written before Colorado made pot legal

819
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:38,880
for adults in

820
00:28:36,519 --> 00:28:40,200
2012 so there's a lot of stuff going on

821
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,840
in this bill like we were saying you

822
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:43,558
guys I'm going to find the bill I've got

823
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:45,879
it on my uh got the PDF here I'm going

824
00:28:43,558 --> 00:28:48,200
to open it up there are a couple things

825
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:51,919
that really got Mike's attention and my

826
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:55,360
attention it starts off and it

827
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:57,559
says a bill for an act the headline is

828
00:28:55,359 --> 00:29:00,278
concerning marijuana issues that are not

829
00:28:57,558 --> 00:29:01,879
regulated by the Department of Revenue

830
00:29:00,278 --> 00:29:04,200
so they're basically they're starting

831
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:06,240
off by saying money this is [ __ ] that

832
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,640
we're not getting money from here's

833
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,038
money Swimming by that we're not

834
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:10,278
catching that's what it sounds like

835
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:13,440
they're saying to me these are the

836
00:29:10,278 --> 00:29:16,159
people we can't Monitor and over tax and

837
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:18,278
here are the ways we found to rectify

838
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:20,000
that so the first part is marijuana

839
00:29:18,278 --> 00:29:21,599
Revenue okay this bill requires the

840
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,640
Colorado Medical Board to adopt rules

841
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:25,639
regarding guidelines for Physicians who

842
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:28,720
make medical marijuana recommendations

843
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:32,000
for patients suffering from severe pain

844
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:34,839
they want to find a new way to figure

845
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,919
out if you really hurt or not yep

846
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:41,759
they've decided that your doctor isn't

847
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:44,200
qualified to believe you and you're not

848
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:45,839
qualified to tell your doctor what hurts

849
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:48,319
and so they're going to come up with a a

850
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:50,759
little sheet or some paperwork so that

851
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:53,200
the doctor can verify that you really do

852
00:29:50,759 --> 00:29:57,119
hurt and you can verify that your doctor

853
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:59,240
is sure that you hurt it's asinine yeah

854
00:29:57,119 --> 00:30:01,798
it hurts trust me yep it wouldn't say it

855
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:03,480
hurts if it didn't uh it goes on it says

856
00:30:01,798 --> 00:30:05,079
uh the bill requires Colorado Medical

857
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,720
Board to adopt rules regarding

858
00:30:05,079 --> 00:30:08,519
guidelines for no wait I already read

859
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,240
that here we go requires a state agency

860
00:30:08,519 --> 00:30:12,200
to adopt rules regarding guidelines for

861
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,839
primary caregivers to give informed

862
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:15,759
consent to patients that the product

863
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:18,439
they cultivate or produce may contain

864
00:30:15,759 --> 00:30:21,919
contaminants and that the levels of THC

865
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:24,440
are not verified so hey Mike as your

866
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:26,480
caregiver did you hear all that I did I

867
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:28,320
haven't tested any of this that's what

868
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:30,759
the warning label on my last pick up

869
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:32,200
says I am giving you informed consent to

870
00:30:30,759 --> 00:30:34,679
my patient that the product I have

871
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:36,440
cultivated or produced may contain C

872
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:40,440
contaminants and that the THC levels are

873
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:42,679
not verified uh yeah that's I didn't put

874
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:44,519
any contaminants on there I I knew that

875
00:30:42,679 --> 00:30:47,360
because I watched the state take away

876
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:49,519
your right to verify your THC

877
00:30:47,359 --> 00:30:51,519
levels yeah well we got it back now with

878
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:53,558
this bill at least they're going to put

879
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:56,038
together a group of people to decide how

880
00:30:53,558 --> 00:30:58,519
and if you get access it's not quite the

881
00:30:56,038 --> 00:31:00,440
same thing yeah if I get access yep can

882
00:30:58,519 --> 00:31:02,519
we let him play that's a big F so the

883
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:04,679
bill requires all primary caregivers to

884
00:31:02,519 --> 00:31:06,120
register with the state uh with the

885
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:08,120
state health agency and the State

886
00:31:06,119 --> 00:31:10,398
medical marijuana licensing Authority

887
00:31:08,119 --> 00:31:12,479
any PR any primary caregiver who is not

888
00:31:10,398 --> 00:31:13,959
registered shall register within 10 days

889
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:16,038
of being informed of the duty to

890
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:17,798
register if a person fails to register

891
00:31:16,038 --> 00:31:20,119
after such 10 days the state health

892
00:31:17,798 --> 00:31:21,480
agency and Licensing Authority shall

893
00:31:20,119 --> 00:31:23,638
prohibit the person from ever

894
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:27,000
registering and acting as a primary

895
00:31:23,638 --> 00:31:29,038
caregiver yep they they didn't they

896
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,919
didn't have a stick to whack at you with

897
00:31:29,038 --> 00:31:32,440
with some of their other rules so now if

898
00:31:30,919 --> 00:31:34,480
they catch you as an unregistered

899
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:36,960
caregiver they're going to give you 10

900
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:39,480
days and if you don't register in 10

901
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:41,120

or where to do that the bill you have to

904
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:48,200
require with the state health if you go

905
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:50,798
to the me website you can download the

906
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:52,360
voluntary registry form that they've had

907
00:31:50,798 --> 00:31:54,319
up there for a while I don't know that

908
00:31:52,359 --> 00:31:56,398
they've put a new form up so when this

909
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:58,759

910
00:31:56,398 --> 00:32:00,199

episode comes out we'll we'll all be

913
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:05,918
[ __ ] we know the 10day time limit is

914
00:32:04,278 --> 00:32:08,679
like if a cop comes to your door and

915
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:10,519

919
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:22,278
to mail all you guys letters saying you

920
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,120

921
00:32:22,278 --> 00:32:25,759
first or whatever then you've got 10

922
00:32:24,119 --> 00:32:28,959
days they could fully pull that too and

923
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:30,919
call that notice wow all right the bill

924
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,759
requires the licensing Authority and the

925
00:32:30,919 --> 00:32:34,480
state health agency to share a minimum

926
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:36,319
amount of information necessary to

927
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:38,519
ensure that a medical marijuana patient

928
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:40,398
has only one caregiver and is not using

929
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:42,038
a primary caregiver and a medical

930
00:32:40,398 --> 00:32:44,798
marijuana

931
00:32:42,038 --> 00:32:47,079
Center uh that makes sense yep yeah

932
00:32:44,798 --> 00:32:48,558
because you if uh I'm a caregiver and I

933
00:32:47,079 --> 00:32:52,359
take good care of my patients you guys

934
00:32:48,558 --> 00:32:53,398
get you get love and uh any caregiver

935
00:32:52,359 --> 00:32:54,558
should be hooking up their patients a

936
00:32:53,398 --> 00:32:55,319
little bit give them some stuff take

937
00:32:54,558 --> 00:32:56,638
care of them make sure they're not

938
00:32:55,319 --> 00:32:58,398
hurting if they come over like my back

939
00:32:56,638 --> 00:33:02,359
hurts you get out of fat dab a CBD and

940
00:32:58,398 --> 00:33:03,719
you [ __ ] them up right uh and and also

941
00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:05,798
that caregiver or that patient should

942
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:07,200
not be going to another caregiver and

943
00:33:05,798 --> 00:33:09,720
getting love from two people and

944
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:11,558
spoiling the whole game right or signed

945
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:13,399
up with multiple people there were a lot

946
00:33:11,558 --> 00:33:16,278
of shop Hoppers when shops were still

947
00:33:13,398 --> 00:33:17,798
able to do sign with us and get blah

948
00:33:16,278 --> 00:33:19,880
people would just go from shop to shop

949
00:33:17,798 --> 00:33:21,960
and sign up with Aiden a day yep and

950
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:23,639
then get all kinds of free [ __ ] and each

951
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:25,440
shop would be under the assumption that

952
00:33:23,638 --> 00:33:27,240
they were growing your six and so it led

953
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,960
to some issues so then here's another

954
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:31,960
fun bill fund bill it says this bill

955
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:34,000
permits money monies in the marijuana

956
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:36,319
tax fund to be used to fund the

957
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,638
implementation of any bills approved by

958
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:42,638
the marijuana revenues interim committee

959
00:33:39,638 --> 00:33:44,599
so all of the marijuana tax money they

960
00:33:42,638 --> 00:33:46,678
want to now they will be able to use

961
00:33:44,599 --> 00:33:49,038
that to implement all of the bills

962
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:51,360
approved by the committee that's kind of

963
00:33:49,038 --> 00:33:53,319

per patient plus your own six

975
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:25,078
36 um unless you special register all of

976
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:27,838
your extended plant count cards which in

977
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:30,480
which case you can grow up to 99

978
00:34:27,838 --> 00:34:32,559
uh after 99 plants you have to become a

979
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:35,440
licensed marijuana business which

980
00:34:32,559 --> 00:34:40,078
requires buying a building and business

981
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:42,398
permits so keep it under 99 people um

982
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:44,119
the nastiest little paragraph I saw that

983
00:34:42,398 --> 00:34:47,199
I haven't seen any of the news pickup

984
00:34:44,119 --> 00:34:50,399
yet is it bans caregivers from working

985
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:52,118
for medical or Rec shops in any way you

986
00:34:50,398 --> 00:34:55,480
can't be an owner you can't be an

987
00:34:52,119 --> 00:34:58,320
employee you can't even visit uh limited

988
00:34:55,480 --> 00:35:01,000
access areas is a visitor or a guest a

989
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:03,760
on a tour yeah that's uh something I'm

990
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:06,039
looking for right now looking for that

991
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:08,640
part I can pull it up on my phone I took

992
00:35:06,039 --> 00:35:11,639
a picture of that

993
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:11,639
paragraph

994
00:35:12,199 --> 00:35:18,838
yeah right I've got it here yeah go

995
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:20,720
ahead and give it a read all right um in

1001
00:35:31,719 --> 00:35:36,199

article

1016
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:17,838
43.3 sorry guys I'm terrible at reading

1017
00:36:15,358 --> 00:36:21,598
aloud but basically what that says is

1018
00:36:17,838 --> 00:36:24,559
primary caregivers cannot work in any

1019
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:27,280
recck or medical shops period uh under

1020
00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:30,000
any sort of badge so if you've got an me

1021
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:32,519
badge and you go to work at a dispensary

1022
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,199
you can no longer grow your own medicine

1023
00:36:32,519 --> 00:36:35,559
you can no longer grow somebody else's

1024
00:36:34,199 --> 00:36:37,239
medicine well you could grow your own

1025
00:36:35,559 --> 00:36:38,599
but you can't be a caregiver for anybody

1026
00:36:37,239 --> 00:36:40,479
okay you can just grow your own but you

1027
00:36:38,599 --> 00:36:42,200
can't I couldn't uh yeah there's a

1028
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:44,039
paragraph in here that says they can't

1029
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:47,318
stop you from growing and your wck

1030
00:36:44,039 --> 00:36:49,358
plants or your own personal six medical

1031
00:36:47,318 --> 00:36:51,159
plants okay but you cannot be a

1032
00:36:49,358 --> 00:36:52,759
caregiver anymore nope so if you are a

1033
00:36:51,159 --> 00:36:54,559
caregiver right now and you work at a

1034
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:55,839
dispensary you've got to figure

1035
00:36:54,559 --> 00:36:57,318
something out how long do they have I

1036
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:59,239
mean this bill went into effect is there

1037
00:36:57,318 --> 00:37:01,199
a I mean people had plants growing you

1038
00:36:59,239 --> 00:37:03,199
know there wasn't technically it went in

1039
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:05,118
it was signing a law on Monday I'm

1040
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:06,639
pretty sure it took effect on Monday it

1041
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:08,039
might be like a six-month grace period

1042
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:09,639
or something we need some sort of time

1043
00:37:08,039 --> 00:37:13,159
you guys you can't just say hey you have

1044
00:37:09,639 --> 00:37:15,239
to find new a way of life I honestly

1045
00:37:13,159 --> 00:37:17,559
haven't seen anyone else talk about this

1046
00:37:15,239 --> 00:37:19,358
section of the bill so I'm not sure the

1047
00:37:17,559 --> 00:37:21,159
implications of it and what that's going

1048
00:37:19,358 --> 00:37:22,960
to do throughout the industry has really

1049
00:37:21,159 --> 00:37:24,879
been considered by anybody but the two

1050
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:26,760
of us can I cut and paste all of this

1051
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:29,000
bill into the notes of this show is is

1052
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:31,119
there some sort of is that legal uh you

1053
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,039
could link it I'm sure okay we'll do

1054
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:35,000
that we'll put this into the show notes

1055
00:37:33,039 --> 00:37:36,639
you guys so that you can read it too uh

1056
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,480
the part that really pisses me off is

1057
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:39,920
the part about being a primary caregiver

1058
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:42,000
and working in a store I've been

1059
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,800
bragging on this show for months now

1060
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,960
that I have become the master grower at

1061
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:49,680
the spot dispensary and uh the time is

1062
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:51,920
coming it's very near um I haven't uh I

1063
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:53,039
haven't actually can't call myself a

1064
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:55,159
full-on employee yet because they

1065
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:56,318
haven't paid me yet for my salary

1066
00:37:55,159 --> 00:37:57,679
because uh it's not time for that

1067
00:37:56,318 --> 00:37:58,960
started yet like they don't have the

1068
00:37:57,679 --> 00:38:02,440
building done that you're going to work

1069
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:04,000
in yet it's damn close buddy word that I

1070
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:05,358
saw pictures a couple weeks ago looks

1071
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,079
real close yeah I've been in there a lot

1072
00:38:05,358 --> 00:38:08,400
lately uh giving advice and helping them

1073
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:09,880
set things up and telling them where to

1074
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,240
put things and kind of doing this and

1075
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:13,200
doing that and getting ready I'm getting

1076
00:38:11,239 --> 00:38:15,078
excited too yeah so I got to figure this

1077
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:17,598
out I know a solution but I hope

1078
00:38:15,079 --> 00:38:18,599
everybody else uh has a solution right A

1079
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:22,039
lot of people are going to have to

1080
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:23,359
scramble yeah I'm lucky uh J loves me

1081
00:38:22,039 --> 00:38:24,559
I've been blessed I had a solution

1082
00:38:23,358 --> 00:38:26,239
before this came up I didn't even know

1083
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:27,559
this was coming so I thought iead on

1084
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:29,199
accident didn't know that was why I had

1085
00:38:27,559 --> 00:38:30,799
that idea there's a lot of people that

1086
00:38:29,199 --> 00:38:32,838
are going to have to scramble I know a

1087
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:35,800
half dozen people in your position

1088
00:38:32,838 --> 00:38:38,400
already that they work in a shop 8 hours

1089
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:40,440
a day and they caregive on their free

1090
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,318
time because they have forever

1091
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:43,920
caregivers are what brought this whole

1092
00:38:42,318 --> 00:38:45,279
thing to where it is now that's how I

1093
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,519
learned how to do what I do so well it's

1094
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:50,000
where the shop wanted me c caregivers

1095
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:54,039
were the medical marijuana industry in

1096
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:55,880
Colorado from 2000 to 2008 period there

1097
00:38:54,039 --> 00:38:57,440
weren't shops if you were a medical

1098
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:59,079
marijuana patient it's because you knew

1099
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:01,119
knew a caregiver and it developed a

1100
00:38:59,079 --> 00:39:02,680
great relationship yep the caregivers

1101
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:05,039
were the ones back in the day taking a

1102
00:39:02,679 --> 00:39:06,960
lot of the medicine to the shops yep

1103
00:39:05,039 --> 00:39:08,880
that's part of what our we knew that we

1104
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:11,880
had that's where the inventory came from

1105
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:13,358
up until like 2010 right yeah that's the

1106
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:15,519
most of the inventory at the shop Mike

1107
00:39:13,358 --> 00:39:17,559
and Mike and I had was grown either in

1108
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:20,159
my old basement in that house in the old

1109
00:39:17,559 --> 00:39:21,279
part of town over there or uh from other

1110
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:22,639

00:40:09,318 --> 00:40:12,480

1134
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:13,880
this bill applies to you you need to

1135
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,280

1139
00:40:18,519 --> 00:40:23,920
if you're far away and wondering what

1140
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:25,800
any of this has to do with you this is

1141
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:28,440
what happens when the community doesn't

1142
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:31,039
stand up and speak for itself yeah is he

1143
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:32,000
gets railroaded and stuff like this

1144
00:40:31,039 --> 00:40:34,279
that's what I said at the beginning of

1145
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,599
the show right down our on it I didn't

1146
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:37,640
even know that this [ __ ] was coming up

1147
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:39,920
to vote on I didn't know that I had

1148
00:40:37,639 --> 00:40:41,440
didn't know no I watched it come I

1149
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:44,400
watched it work its way through the

1150
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:47,318
Colorado process and I watched people

1151
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:50,680
argue and fight I read the articles and

1152
00:40:47,318 --> 00:40:52,880
sent the emails and it just there was

1153
00:40:50,679 --> 00:40:55,399
some progress the original bill was a

1154
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:57,358
lot worse yeah a lot I remember you

1155
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:58,680
saying that I'm cool Comm and collected

1156
00:40:57,358 --> 00:41:00,598
right now but I've got some things to

1157
00:40:58,679 --> 00:41:02,799
change in my life because of this bill

1158
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:04,880
oh I half of me wants to scream and

1159
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:07,359
smash cuz this is really really ugly and

1160
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:08,920
it's going to do a lot of harm yeah

1161
00:41:07,358 --> 00:41:10,199
don't worry uh there's a solution to

1162
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:11,800
everything on our end I know what we're

1163
00:41:10,199 --> 00:41:13,799
going to do already oh I'm not worried

1164
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:15,318
about you I'm worried about the three or

1165
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:17,039
four I mean there's like 4,000

1166
00:41:15,318 --> 00:41:18,800
caregivers in Colorado I'm going to

1167
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:21,599
guess that 2,000 of them work in

1168
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:23,280
dispensaries yeah I mean that those are

1169
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:25,400
there's definitely 4,000 caregivers in

1170
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:27,560
Colorado the 2,000 is kind of a guess

1171
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:31,200
but still that's 2,000 people that have

1172
00:41:27,559 --> 00:41:32,880
to come up with a sketchy workaround or

1173
00:41:31,199 --> 00:41:34,639
quit their job one or the other do you

1174
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,519
want to fire the five people you're

1175
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:38,199
providing medication and caregiving for

1176
00:41:36,519 --> 00:41:40,440
or do you want to quit your day job

1177
00:41:38,199 --> 00:41:42,519
that's your income because you can't

1178
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:44,838
make money being a caregiver right you

1179
00:41:42,519 --> 00:41:46,239
can that's how recoup your bills but

1180
00:41:44,838 --> 00:41:48,599
that's not the same thing as getting

1181
00:41:46,239 --> 00:41:50,039
paid the day job funds the caregiving

1182
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:51,318
right like without the day job you can't

1183
00:41:50,039 --> 00:41:53,199
afford to caregive because you're given

1184
00:41:51,318 --> 00:41:54,960
you got to pay for the lights if you

1185
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:56,358
need a new gear could your patients come

1186
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,800

1189

really talking about here in Pueblo it's

1210
00:42:44,599 --> 00:42:48,559
real important we're going to be voting

1211
00:42:45,838 --> 00:42:50,440
on Rec shops in the city hey you told me

1212
00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:52,400
that I kind of messed up the last report

1213
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:53,639
I said on that to correct me because I

1214
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:56,358
don't want to be wrong on the show it

1215
00:42:53,639 --> 00:42:57,639
was it episode 69 or 70 I don't remember

1216
00:42:56,358 --> 00:42:59,558
which when you cover

1217
00:42:57,639 --> 00:43:02,519
uh recently the Pueblo City Council

1218
00:42:59,559 --> 00:43:05,599
voted uh not to license recck shops in

1219
00:43:02,519 --> 00:43:07,599
the city and they punted so now the

1220
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:09,838
voters are going to decide on some

1221
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:11,559
marijuana question or another in

1222
00:43:09,838 --> 00:43:12,639
November the city council has no idea

1223
00:43:11,559 --> 00:43:14,400
what they're going to ask the voters

1224
00:43:12,639 --> 00:43:16,440
it's not going to be the 11 page

1225
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:19,000
nonsense ordinance they didn't vote on

1226
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:20,960
last Monday so hopefully it'll be a

1227
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:24,079
short and suweet do we want Rec stores

1228
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:26,000
in the city yes or no but who knows um

1229
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:27,640
when I ask city council directly I got a

1230
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,159
snarky response from from one of them

1231
00:43:27,639 --> 00:43:32,440
saying show up to those meetings and

1232
00:43:29,159 --> 00:43:35,199
find out you know in uh before I've said

1233
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:36,920
I'm impartial to rec stores in the city

1234
00:43:35,199 --> 00:43:39,279
but bring it on we need a Rec store on

1235
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:42,519
our city we need those jobs and taxes

1236
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:45,800
period is a poor City full of poor

1237
00:43:42,519 --> 00:43:47,920
people who need jobs yeah and if you can

1238
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:50,480
give us 12 jobs by opening opening a

1239
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:51,960
dispensary that's 12 people and that's

1240
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:54,280
something I've noticed that people uh

1241
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:55,880
our age the 24 to 35 range that's been

1242
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:57,640
kind of [ __ ] for the past 10 years

1243
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:58,720
they finally got something to do the

1244
00:43:57,639 --> 00:43:59,960
people that got out of college and

1245
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:01,480
realized that there's nothing to [ __ ]

1246
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:02,559
do with that college degree sorry to

1247
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:05,519
look you straight in the face when I say

1248
00:44:02,559 --> 00:44:07,480
that right but my sociology degree makes

1249
00:44:05,519 --> 00:44:09,679
[ __ ] less confusing to me personally but

1250
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:10,880
it doesn't do [ __ ] off for my bills yeah

1251
00:44:09,679 --> 00:44:12,759
yeah you're going to work in a

1252
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:14,039
dispensary now it's finally got

1253
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:16,240
