00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:35,400

68
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,719

69
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,840

70
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:44,699
both unusual and Urgent well I like to I

71
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,560
like to help out when I can it goes on

72
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:49,500
it says you see I am in desperate need

73
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:52,140
of a baby brother who can shred on the

74
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:54,000
drums and I have reason to believe that

75
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:55,799
you are just the man for the job now

76
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,479
when I first read this I thought this

77
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,120
guy was calling me his new baby brother

78
00:02:57,479 --> 00:03:01,738
because I am a I'm a decent drummer I

79
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,239
can hold my own on a drum kit I can rock

80
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:05,400
it I can get down we can play some funk

81
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:07,259
some Reggae some blues uh don't change

82
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,239
time signatures without warning me but I

83
00:03:07,259 --> 00:03:11,098
can keep up and play some odd times I

84
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:12,480
can read and write music anyway I

85
00:03:11,098 --> 00:03:14,699
thought this was going to be about me

86
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:15,658
being the funky drummer baby brother it

87
00:03:14,699 --> 00:03:17,458
goes on

88
00:03:15,658 --> 00:03:19,259
it does say now you may be wondering

89
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:21,598
exactly how you can assist in this

90
00:03:19,259 --> 00:03:23,340
matter fear not for I have a proposal

91
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:25,560
that I believe you will find both

92
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:27,539
intriguing and enticing now this is

93
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,098
where it really gets weird my friends it

94
00:03:27,539 --> 00:03:31,378
says my mother who is a lovely and

95
00:03:29,098 --> 00:03:33,359
talented woman in her own right has long

96
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:35,280
harbored a desire to start a family with

97
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,560
someone who shares her passion for music

98
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,900
and who better than you roster Jeff with

99
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:42,000
your prodigious skills on the drums and

100
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:45,120
an unmistakable love for all things rock

101
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,199
and roll this has taken a quick turn for

102
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,000
the weirdest but I'm going to keep

103
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:50,399
reading it says think about it with your

104
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,378
jeans and my mother's musical prowess we

105
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,658
could create a child who is destined for

106
00:03:52,378 --> 00:03:56,219
greatness on the drum set so our friend

107
00:03:54,658 --> 00:03:59,158
here would like to create a breeding

108
00:03:56,219 --> 00:04:02,459
project between myself and his mother so

109
00:03:59,158 --> 00:04:05,280
that we can F1 a baby brother for him

110
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:06,840
with traits from his mother and myself

111
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,280
hey that's a great idea that's a great

112
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,019
project I'm glad that you saw that

113
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,818
that's a good eye for breeding my dude

114
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:13,560
it goes on though it says so what do you

115

say Ross to Jeff will you help me

116

fulfill my dream of having a baby

117
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:19,319
brother who shreds on the drums I

118
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:22,319
promise that the rewards will be many

119
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:25,560
both in this life and the next sincerely

120
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:26,579
from Turkey I apologize for giggling in

121
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,379
the end there I tried to hold it

122
00:04:26,579 --> 00:04:31,198
together for that whole message

123
00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:33,719
uh my friend turkey

124
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,819
um there's a lot to commit to to this

125
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,979
here I don't know that I want to uh I'm

126
00:04:35,819 --> 00:04:39,599
not sure that I can uh agree to this at

127
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:42,839
this time my friend I'm gonna have to

128
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,120
politely decline the offer here but

129
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:46,859
um that is uh not to say that you can't

130
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,780
check back in the future you know what

131
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:50,520
I'm saying things may change I may uh

132
00:04:48,779 --> 00:04:52,379
there may be a software update that does

133
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:53,819
change my opinion so that's our first

134
00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:56,100
breeding question for today's episode

135
00:04:53,819 --> 00:04:57,540
that one did come from my friend Turkey

136
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,520
um I do feel I have not met your mother

137
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:02,040
yet but I do feel that I could pass on

138
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:03,359
this drummer Gene this Rockstar vibe

139
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:05,520
that may be an option I do have a

140
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,020
daughter who is quite a rock star all

141

um that's just a long commitment my bro

146
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:16,799
I'm not sure that I want to commit to

147

that whole thing I don't want to have

148

who is suffering from terrible seizures

201

right now we're taking every medicine

202
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:03,180
the vet can offer at the highest dose

203
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:05,220

204
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:07,439
man I'm sorry that is terrible uh

205
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:09,479
seizures are heartbreaking to watch

206
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:11,639
someone or something you care about is

207
00:07:09,478 --> 00:07:12,839
uh flopping around and you can't do [ __ ]

208
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:14,819
about it it's heartbreaking I've been

209
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:16,379
there before I know how you feel uh

210
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:18,120

211

for you and your dog I hope that we are

212

213
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,300
hope the Cannabis Community can help you

214
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:27,180
out it goes on it says I got my hands on

215
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:28,620
some chronic CBD from serious seeds I've

216
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:31,079
grown it and made him some good boy

217
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:33,120
treats uh that's a super good dog dad of

218
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:35,399
you it says unfortunately there's too

219
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,160
much THC in this strain and he gets way

220
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:40,138
more stoned than I want and more stoned

221
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,360
than he wants yeah

222
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:43,918
um I've seen some dogs get too damn

223
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,598
stone and that that's also heartbreaking

224
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:46,740
sometimes it's funny for about 10

225
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:49,199
minutes but then you're like [ __ ] that

226
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:51,060
dog's [ __ ] suffering anyway it says

227
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,520
would you have a strain that may offer

228
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:55,620
us some relief but not [ __ ] this dog up

229
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:57,659
yes this is a very good question I do

230
00:07:55,620 --> 00:08:00,240
need to jump in right now and say uh for

231
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:01,860
legal purposes for safety purposes that

232
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,300
first of all Rasta Jeff is a fictional

233
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:05,580
character that's not even my real name

234
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:08,038
but also Rasta Jeff is not a

235
00:08:05,579 --> 00:08:10,859
veterinarian I am not qualified to give

236
00:08:08,038 --> 00:08:13,259
you any real medical advice if it's for

237
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:14,759
a human if it's for a dog I am not a

238
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:17,520
doctor I'm not wearing a lab coat I've

239
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:19,080
got dreadlocks down to my they go to my

240
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:20,639
calves by now you guys I'm six five the

241
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:22,199
dreads go to my calves I got dreads to

242
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,720
my calves I'm wearing a [ __ ] Nike

243
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:26,699
hoodie and some dunks over here I'm not

244
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,160
qualified to give true solid medical

245
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:31,319
advice or veterinarian advice I've got

246
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:33,360
to make that disclaimer just because uh

247
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:34,680
people are [ __ ] litigious these days

248
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,599
and I'm not trying to get sued for

249
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:37,978
saying some silly [ __ ] so I'm not a

250
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:41,399
doctor I'm not qualified to give a

251
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:42,839
medical advice however and also I'm

252
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:44,759
definitely not qualified and people are

253
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:46,800
going to have something to say if we

254
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:48,720
start talking about uh giving your dog

255
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:50,278
cannabis some people are against that I

256
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,899
am not against that I think the Cannabis

257
00:08:50,278 --> 00:08:53,639
Is A Healer if we do it properly if the

258
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:55,320
dog's into it you guys know that one of

259
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:56,699
the dogs I was around often loves to

260
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,080
smoke when I smoke he comes and stands

261
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,940
next to me and gets mad if I don't blow

262
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,379
him some but

263
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,519
if the dog enjoys it it's all good but

264
00:09:01,379 --> 00:09:03,600
there's going to be activists on the

265
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:05,100
other side saying that it's wrong to

266
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,320
give your dog cannabis to help this out

267
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:09,060
but here's what I'm going to say I'm not

268
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:11,278
a veterinarian but if this were I'm not

269
00:09:09,059 --> 00:09:12,599
a very veterinarian or a doctor but if

270
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:14,700
this were one of my friends who were

271
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:17,100
near me I would offer them something

272
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:18,600
more of a uh it sounds like what you

273
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:20,519
grew I don't know if you've lab tested

274
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:22,440
it we don't know how much THC to CBD is

275
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:25,080
in there I would find something that is

276
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:26,940
just CBD that doesn't have any THC in it

277
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,259
if possible and see if that helps with

278
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:30,720
the seizures that's where I would start

279
00:09:28,259 --> 00:09:32,159
something just CBD you haven't lab

280
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,600
tested your products so we don't know

281
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:34,860
the levels in there maybe you did I

282
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,720
don't know the levels in that product

283
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:38,879
what I would recommend is starting with

284
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,519
something just CBD but of course you

285
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:44,039
know not gas station CBD I'd recommend

286
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:46,860
cannabis derived American made lab

287
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:48,419
tested CBD that we can trust I'm not

288
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:50,159
sure where you're going to get that many

289
00:09:48,419 --> 00:09:52,319
people will say a dispensary many people

290
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:54,059
will have other recommendations in

291
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,459
Illinois I don't know your options but I

292
00:09:54,059 --> 00:09:58,919
would get some tried intrude uh

293
00:09:56,458 --> 00:10:00,719
something a reputable brand of just CBD

294
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:01,679
If This Were a person and that I knew

295
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,759
this is what I would recommend I'm

296
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:04,019
trying to stay away from the dog thing

297
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:05,278
not get myself in trouble but you know

298
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:06,539
what I'm talking about here

299
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:08,820
um I would recommend something with just

300
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:11,039
CBD and see if that stops the seizures

301
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:13,140
without [ __ ] up the the person or the

302
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:14,759
dog that you're giving this to then if

303
00:10:13,139 --> 00:10:17,819
that doesn't work then I would work on

304
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:20,639
something with a one-to-one uh THC to

305
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:22,980
CBD ratio uh something that has got an

306
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:26,278
equal amount CBD to an equal amount of

307
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:28,800
THC that way I believe I'm not a doctor

308
00:10:26,278 --> 00:10:31,019
but I do believe in the Entourage effect

309
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:33,000
the synergistic effect is what it's also

310
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:35,700
been called I think that when we isolate

311
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,458
cannabinoids the CBD it works I think

312
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:40,680
when we isolate THC it works but when we

313
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:42,838
combine those two things and the certain

314
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:44,699
ratios that work for each person's body

315
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:46,500
that's when I think they work the best

316
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:49,140
they work the best in conjunction with

317
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:50,940
other cannabinoids Esters terpenes

318
00:10:49,139 --> 00:10:52,379
paleots all the other products all the

319
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:53,820
other compounds that come with the

320
00:10:52,379 --> 00:10:55,860
Cannabis I think they all work together

321
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:57,899
so I think you may need to find the

322
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:59,820
correct appropriate balance for your

323
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:02,039
patient which in your case is your dog

324
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:03,360
so I would start off you've been giving

325
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:04,740
them something that we don't know the

326
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,019
lab results of I would start off with

327
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:09,240
something we do know lab results of all

328
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:11,459
all CBD if you can get it then I would

329
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,680
go with something CBD and THC and

330
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:15,479
monitor if the CBD Works stick with that

331
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:16,919
if it doesn't then add some THC to it

332
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,899
slowly

333
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:21,419
um a strain that I can recommend that is

334
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:23,339
in my Arsenal that is not available on I

335
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:24,958
redirect I don't sell this strain but it

336
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:26,940
is available if you need it reach out to

337
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:28,319
me honestly right now I'm swamped with

338
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:30,480
emails but I'm doing my best to dig

339
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,459
myself out I've got a strain that is

340
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,339
called Purple Heart it does often

341
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:38,458
produce phenotypes with a one-to-one THC

342
00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:40,019
to CBD ratio so however much CBD is

343
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:42,958
available in the plant is also available

344
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:45,480
in the THC now we are finding outliers

345
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:47,819
of phenotypes that do become THC

346
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,920
dominant and outliers that are THC did I

347
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:52,260
say which one they lean one way to THC

348
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:53,699
one way to do CBD there are phenotypes

349
00:11:52,259 --> 00:11:56,159
that you'll find all types of different

350
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:59,820
cannabinoid ratios but the majority of

351
00:11:56,159 --> 00:12:01,559
them put off a one to one THC to CBD

352
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:03,540
show when grown and dried and cured

353
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:05,338
properly so I would recommend a strain

354
00:12:03,539 --> 00:12:06,139
called Purple Heart I did say that's not

355
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:09,180
available

356
00:12:06,139 --> 00:12:10,259
heart was made in a friend's grow space

357
00:12:09,179 --> 00:12:10,859
so

358
00:12:10,259 --> 00:12:13,200
um

359
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:16,500
I full disclosure I guess I have a

360
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:18,060
friend who I rent grow space from and he

361
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:20,220
wanted me to breed with one of his

362
00:12:18,059 --> 00:12:22,259
plants and it was a CBD dominant plan

363
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:23,940
and he is

364
00:12:22,259 --> 00:12:25,980
um he's a veteran he has served for the

365
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:27,959
United States military and he said that

366
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:29,879
this CBD plant that he smokes helps with

367
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:32,639
his night terrors and it helps with his

368
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:34,439
uh PTSD from being in the military so I

369
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,539
wanted to cross that to something and

370
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:38,339
make feminized seeds with it and when I

371
00:12:36,539 --> 00:12:40,319
rented his space one of his requirements

372
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:41,880
of the space rental was to put that

373
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,278
plant in there and breed to it to make

374
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:46,500
something even better for the veterans

375
00:12:44,278 --> 00:12:48,659
for the people that experience PTSD the

376
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:50,100
night terrors the other symptoms they

377
00:12:48,659 --> 00:12:51,360
come from being in combat and being

378
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,980
exposed to things that would probably

379
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,139
traumatize the most of us for the rest

380
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:56,820
of our lives that plant helps with that

381
00:12:55,139 --> 00:12:58,860
I wanted to make something like that

382
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:00,360
with my lineup he said that his cherry

383
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:02,519
plant was really good but it could be

384
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:04,200
improved upon I knew that my Afterglow

385
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:06,659
pollen donor was going to be amazing I

386
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:08,160
put the Afterglow and the Cherry CBD

387
00:13:06,659 --> 00:13:10,078
plant in the room they did Magic

388
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:12,179
together out of that comes purple heart

389
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:14,399
I promise missed my friend that I would

390
00:13:12,179 --> 00:13:16,078
never sell Purple Heart seeds I gave him

391
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,240
a good portion of them I have a good

392
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:20,399
portion of them every Purple Heart seed

393
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,860
that has ever left the irie genetics

394
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,240
office has been for free I've given them

395
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:27,600
to Veterans I've given them to people

396
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:29,039
with PTSD night terrors traumatic

397
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,959
problems like that I try to help them

398
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:32,338
out with the Purple Heart seeds there

399
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:33,778
are not a lot left right now I do need

400
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:36,060

00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:49,259

409
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:51,419
just gendered your dog I apologize good

410
00:13:49,259 --> 00:13:52,799
doggie I hope you're doing well uh let's

411
00:13:51,419 --> 00:13:53,879
make sure I covered up all the notes on

412
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:55,319
this one

413
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:57,000
um I'm not a veterinarian I'm not a

414
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,620
doctor Rasta Jeff is not even my real

415
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,480
name

416
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:03,299
um yeah I would recommend starting with

417
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,039
CBD and then add some THC and see how

418
00:14:03,299 --> 00:14:06,719
they work and then figure out the ratio

419
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:09,480
it's going to take some dosing that's

420
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,980
unfortunately that's the uh for me

421
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:13,079
that's the fun part for some people

422
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:15,060
that's the challenging part of cannabis

423
00:14:13,078 --> 00:14:16,919
it's hard to recommend exactly what to

424
00:14:15,059 --> 00:14:18,958
take because it's all about how our

425
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:21,599
bodies are going to act and react to

426
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:23,578
that cannabis the different terpenes uh

427
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,259
the different cannabinoids that all hits

428
00:14:23,578 --> 00:14:27,899
us differently I'm the kind of guy that

429
00:14:25,259 --> 00:14:29,639
I'll smoke a big fat [ __ ] dab of some

430
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:31,320
sativa concentrates that most people are

431
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:32,759
going to have a panic attack and that

432
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,980
puts me right on the zone to come talk

433
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:36,419
on a podcast for 40 minutes most people

434
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:38,339
would be freaking out running from the

435
00:14:36,419 --> 00:14:40,860
lights or having a hard time if I smoke

436
00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:42,779
a heavy heavy Indica most people get

437
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:45,360
like kind of lazy a heavy heavy Indica

438
00:14:42,778 --> 00:14:46,799
makes me want to go for a walk so our

439
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,720
bodies are way different I've got this

440
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:50,399
add brain that just keeps going makes me

441
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,740
talk a million miles an hour so things

442
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:54,179
work different differently for me all

443
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:55,980
right I think I rambled on about this

444
00:14:54,179 --> 00:14:57,120
one for quite a long time my buddy Tommy

445
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:59,759
two tracks thank you for the great

446
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,799
message seriously I hope the dog is well

447
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:03,240
because the dog is man's best friend and

448
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:04,919
it just sucks to see a family member

449
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:07,259
suffering so be happy to help you out

450

those purple hearts send me your address

451
00:15:07,259 --> 00:15:10,740
my dude all right we've been going for a

452
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,440
few minutes I do have another message

453
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:15,480
here in front of me this one came from

454
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,920
our friend who wants to be called Billy

455
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,480
big shout out to our friend Billy thank

456
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:20,698
you for the great message thank you for

457
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:23,519
helping me generate listener generated

458
00:15:20,698 --> 00:15:25,439
content I do enjoy that I am rambling I

459
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,720
think I've had too many dabs this

460
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,399
message goes a little bit and quite a

461
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,680
bit and just like this it says two

462
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:33,899
questions please my bro first do you

463
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:35,338
ever give your plants cloudy days by

464
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:36,958
that I mean dimming the lights like

465
00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:38,820
maybe when temps are a little bit hot

466
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:41,338
then it says I've been doing that for a

467
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:43,980
while and they seem to like it or am I

468
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:46,860
wasting my time and it might be my

469
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:49,680
imagination okay that is a good question

470
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:51,480
um I would never uh turn down the lights

471
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:53,939
in my grow space on unless it was

472
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:55,139
required if it was way too hot the air

473
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:57,060
conditioner couldn't keep up the

474
00:15:55,139 --> 00:15:59,159
ventilation couldn't keep up I do not

475
00:15:57,059 --> 00:16:01,198
turn down the lights unless there is a

476
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:02,578
problem I get them at their Peak uh

477
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:04,379
their Peak Performance that the the

478
00:16:02,578 --> 00:16:05,879
amount of light that the plants want I

479
00:16:04,379 --> 00:16:07,139
can kind of see what if there's too much

480
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:08,820
or not enough light in there at this

481
00:16:07,139 --> 00:16:10,560
point I've been working with the LEDs

482
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:12,480
for a while so I get the plants to their

483
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:16,018
Peak Performance and then I do not turn

484
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:18,778
down that light or unplug a light ever

485
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:21,060
um basically think about it like these

486
00:16:18,778 --> 00:16:22,439
plants are the UFC fighters of plants

487
00:16:21,059 --> 00:16:24,659
our cannabis plants we put them in a

488
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:26,100
cage you put them in a 4x4 tent and then

489
00:16:24,659 --> 00:16:28,559
we expect them to [ __ ] let's get

490
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:30,240
ready to rumble every single day in that

491
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:32,819
grow room they're in there for nine or

492
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:35,220
ten weeks that's only 63 to 70 days in

493
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:36,899
the flowering phase I want and then

494
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:38,639
we've got the veg phases equally as

495
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:40,679
important as this face I should touch on

496
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,839
that too A lot of people Overlook the

497
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:44,159
importance of the veg face that is the

498
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:46,740
foundation that is building the

499
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:49,500
foundation the framework the veg phases

500
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:50,940
equally as important so in any phase I

501
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,440
do not turn down the lighting because

502
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:54,959
think of it like that's a nine week

503
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:56,519
training camp and at week 10 we got a

504
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:58,439
fight coming up if you had a fight

505
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:59,339
coming up you're going in that cage and

506
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:02,339
you're going to swing it out with

507
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:04,620
whoever your favorite UFC fighter is uh

508
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:07,199
would you train every day or would you

509
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:09,418
go 70 some days because you know that

510
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:11,579
the other guy is going a [ __ ] 110

511
00:17:09,419 --> 00:17:13,860
every single day so you got to get in

512
00:17:11,578 --> 00:17:15,779
there and go at it so my theory is no I

513
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:17,818
would not turn down the lights unless it

514
00:17:15,779 --> 00:17:19,980
was detrimental to rescuing the crop if

515
00:17:17,818 --> 00:17:22,019
it got too hot then I would consider

516
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:23,640
turning down the lights but no that is

517
00:17:22,019 --> 00:17:24,900
the main source of fuel and energy for

518
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,819
our plant that's what makes everything

519
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:29,519
else happen that's what drives

520
00:17:26,818 --> 00:17:31,019
photosynthesis which is what drives Bud

521
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:33,298
production in the end why would I turn

522
00:17:31,019 --> 00:17:35,220
that down so no I do not give the plants

523
00:17:33,298 --> 00:17:36,660
cloudy days if it's cloudy outside it's

524
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:38,579
bright as [ __ ] in the grow room if it's

525
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:39,919
raining outside bright as [ __ ] in the

526
00:17:38,579 --> 00:17:42,720
grow room if it's hot as [ __ ] outside

527
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:44,700
try to keep it decent in the grow room

528
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,960
it's a struggle sometimes but no I do

529
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:48,120
not turn down the lights I do not give

530
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:49,798
them cloudy days I focus on making sure

531
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:51,058
those plants get as much light as

532
00:17:49,798 --> 00:17:53,220
possible before they start getting

533
00:17:51,058 --> 00:17:55,079
problems make sure they get as much

534
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:57,058
light for as long as they need to keep

535
00:17:55,079 --> 00:17:58,980
them in the proper cycle I need them in

536
00:17:57,058 --> 00:18:00,839
and to get top performance so no I do

537
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:02,400
not change the light okay there is a

538
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:04,678
part two to this question it goes on it

539
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,798
says are plants that start seeding two

540
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:10,200
to three weeks into flower worth keeping

541
00:18:07,798 --> 00:18:12,599
um why are they seating that's my main

542
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:14,340
question then it goes on it says will

543
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:16,619
they concentrate on making seeds and not

544
00:18:14,339 --> 00:18:19,379
flour at that point I always throw away

545
00:18:16,619 --> 00:18:21,000
the garbage you're my Guru bro lay some

546
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:22,500
knowledge on me all right so we got some

547
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,839
things to talk about here you have asked

548
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:26,519
uh if plants that start seeding two to

549
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:29,699
three weeks into flower are worth

550
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:31,440
keeping there's got to be a reason why

551
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:33,720
the seeds are popping up at that stage

552
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:36,179
in the game uh usually plants aren't

553
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:38,100
even able to start producing seeds until

554
00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:39,480
about well they can as soon as the

555
00:18:38,099 --> 00:18:40,678
pistols are there they can produce seeds

556
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,779
but you're not going to see seed

557
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:44,340
production for several days after those

558
00:18:42,779 --> 00:18:45,660
pistols pop up they've got to get

559
00:18:44,339 --> 00:18:47,819
pollinated seeds have to start

560
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:50,640
developing first of all I'm wondering if

561
00:18:47,819 --> 00:18:52,259
what you're actually seeing is seeds I'm

562
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,400
not doubting you I haven't seen pictures

563
00:18:52,259 --> 00:18:55,079
I don't know how long you've been

564
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,880
growing I'd like to know if those

565
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:58,379
definitely are seeds I'd like a very

566
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,059
seasoned experienced grower to look in

567
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:01,860
there and look at those buds and say no

568
00:19:00,058 --> 00:19:03,899
those are calyxes or no those are seeds

569
00:19:01,859 --> 00:19:06,418
they could be swollen bracks is what you

570
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:08,400
may be identifying as seeds give it a

571
00:19:06,419 --> 00:19:09,900
squeeze does the bubble thing that looks

572
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,179
like a seed does it pop and is there a

573
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:15,059
seed shell in there or is it just juicy

574
00:19:12,179 --> 00:19:16,679
uh plant juicy it'll it'll have like a

575
00:19:15,058 --> 00:19:17,879
popcorn kernel in it but give it a

576
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:19,980
squeeze see if there's a seed in there

577
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:21,539
or see if that is a swollen bract you

578
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:23,400
could be very mistaken a lot of new

579
00:19:21,538 --> 00:19:24,900
Growers see those little bracks that

580
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,700
develop right at the bottom of the node

581
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:28,259
and they think that that's a seed that

582
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,880
is not that's a bracket don't be too

583
00:19:28,259 --> 00:19:32,400
paranoid now the next thing I want to

584
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:34,200
say is why did seeds happen if these are

585
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:37,140
seeds why did they occur what is causing

586
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:38,700
this is there pollen in the room

587
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:40,200
um have you had a male plant in that

588
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:41,220
room and not cleaned it up do you have a

589
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,779
male plant in the room that you haven't

590
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:45,480
identified and he's skeeting on the

591
00:19:42,779 --> 00:19:47,519
ladies making seeds or maybe my other

592
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:49,500
idea maybe which are identifying as

593
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:50,879
seeds maybe those are male Panthers

594
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,140
farming on the plant maybe you got a

595
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,539
male plant

596
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:57,000
um also my next question is was there an

597
00:19:54,538 --> 00:19:59,400
intersex plant in this room or are those

598
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,200
plants themselves intersex I really want

599
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:03,600
to get down to where do the seeds what

600
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:06,058
caused the seeds first question is like

601
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:07,379
really are these seeds next question

602
00:20:06,058 --> 00:20:09,599
would be where do the seeds come from

603
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:12,480
there's got to be pollen or an intersex

604
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:14,819
issue then the next things I would start

605
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:17,279
thinking about is uh have you over or

606
00:20:14,819 --> 00:20:18,960
underwatered drastically

607
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:21,599
um at any point in late veg or early

608
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,880
flower was there like a huge flood or a

609
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:26,819
drought those things could lead to

610
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:29,100
intersex or possibly maybe this is early

611
00:20:26,819 --> 00:20:30,899
rotolization self-seeding maybe that's

612
00:20:29,099 --> 00:20:33,240
what's happening is your vapor pressure

613
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:34,919
deficit dialed in is it too hot in the

614
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,960
room is it too cold in the room how's

615
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:39,780
your humidity is it too dry too moist

616
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:42,600
are there drastic swings of either of

617
00:20:39,779 --> 00:20:45,240
those things any drastic swings of any

618
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:47,519
of the VPD can definitely mess up your

619
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:49,679
whole crop and give you intersex traits

620
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:51,240
could definitely give you uh seeding I'm

621
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:53,220
not convinced these are seeds the more I

622
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:54,720
talk about it my next question is how

623
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:57,600
about light leaks are you getting any

624
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,100
light leaks in your flowering phase when

625
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:00,779
I say light leaks some people don't

626
00:20:59,099 --> 00:21:03,298
understand exactly what I mean the light

627
00:21:00,779 --> 00:21:06,000
leak means an interruption of the dark

628
00:21:03,298 --> 00:21:07,619
period cannabis is very photo period

629
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,200
sensitive that's why we put it in a dark

630
00:21:07,619 --> 00:21:12,359
period for 12 hours to make it flower if

631
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,740
we interrupt that dark period the plants

632
00:21:12,359 --> 00:21:15,979
get a little bit confused and they start

633
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:19,079
going into what the [ __ ] mode imagine

634
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:21,000
just imagine if you will maybe one day

635
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:22,619
you're outside right and the sun goes

636
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,419
down you're like oh it's like 7 30 the

637
00:21:22,619 --> 00:21:26,579
sun went down I'm gonna go inside and do

638
00:21:24,419 --> 00:21:28,080
whatever I do from 7 30 to bedtime and

639
00:21:26,579 --> 00:21:29,819
you do your thing you smoke a couple

640
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:32,339
bowls you watch a podcast you hang out

641
00:21:29,819 --> 00:21:34,740
on Discord eat some ice cream you go to

642
00:21:32,339 --> 00:21:37,439
bed right and then suddenly like three

643
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:39,659
in the morning the sun comes up just

644
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:42,298
boom the sun you're gonna look out the

645
00:21:39,659 --> 00:21:44,100
window and you're gonna go what the [ __ ]

646
00:21:42,298 --> 00:21:44,879
it's not going to be a good feeling you

647
00:21:44,099 --> 00:21:46,740
say

648
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,820
that's that's the sun you're gonna look

649
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:49,980
at all of the clocks you're gonna look

650
00:21:47,819 --> 00:21:52,798
at your phone you're gonna go

651
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:55,079
three o'clock 3 P.M no it's three a.m

652
00:21:52,798 --> 00:21:58,500
you look at the iPad You're Gonna Go

653
00:21:55,079 --> 00:22:00,779
3 A.M you go to the microwave 3 A.M look

654
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:01,740
at the look at the computer screen 3 A.M

655
00:22:00,779 --> 00:22:03,658
you're gonna look at your watch because

656
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:06,120
maybe you got a watch that's analog it

657
00:22:03,659 --> 00:22:08,220
hasn't [ __ ] up yet 3 A.M it's all

658
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:09,359
three a.m why is the Sun up then you're

659
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:11,100
gonna go to social media and you're

660
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:12,658
gonna see that everybody on the [ __ ]

661
00:22:11,099 --> 00:22:14,759
planet is freaking out that the sun's up

662
00:22:12,659 --> 00:22:16,320
at 3 A.M you're gonna go into full-on

663
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:18,779
panic mode imagine if you were a plant

664
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:20,519
you've got options you can freak out you

665
00:22:18,779 --> 00:22:22,678
can freak out emotionally physically you

666
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:24,179
can try to procreate that's what the

667
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:25,980
plants are gonna do the plants are going

668
00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:27,900
to try to procreate before the end of

669
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:30,000
the [ __ ] world if you start flipping

670
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:32,400
the sun on in the middle of the night to

671
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,859
them they're gonna go what the [ __ ] dude

672
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,900
cannabis's whole goal the main purpose

673
00:22:34,859 --> 00:22:38,759
of a cannabis plant is to reproduce and

674
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:41,340
make seeds for next year

675
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:42,599
if the plant thinks that Armageddon is

676
00:22:41,339 --> 00:22:44,038
[ __ ] coming that the sun just

677
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:45,298
reversed its schedule it's going to go

678
00:22:44,038 --> 00:22:47,640
hey bro

679
00:22:45,298 --> 00:22:49,740
I'm gonna die I'm gonna make some seeds

680
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:50,880
and she's gonna start spitting out seeds

681
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:52,679
naturally because it doesn't know what

682
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,720
the [ __ ] is going on with the world and

683
00:22:52,679 --> 00:22:57,179
it wants to survive it's like Jurassic

684
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,679
Park life will find a way that plant

685
00:22:57,179 --> 00:23:00,240
will just spit out seeds because it

686
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:01,440
thinks the end of the [ __ ] world is

687
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,120
coming so

688
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,820
um this plant possibly if there are

689
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:06,899
light leaks this plant maybe woke up one

690
00:23:05,819 --> 00:23:09,720
night at three o'clock in the morning

691
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:11,880
and went the [ __ ] Sun's up bro

692
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:13,380
made a bunch of seeds it may not happen

693
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,760
from just one light leak but if you've

694
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:16,740
got several interruptions or a

695
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:18,538
consistent interruption or perhaps

696
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:20,159
there's one area in the grow space

697
00:23:18,538 --> 00:23:22,259
that's just not sealed off the lights

698
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:23,760
getting in somewhere I've seen the light

699
00:23:22,259 --> 00:23:26,460
come in through like zipper holes in the

700
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:27,658
tents the ducting holes and the tents we

701
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:29,220
use the lights with the reflectors

702
00:23:27,659 --> 00:23:31,500
inside of the tent sometimes I've seen

703
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:33,120
the light come down the duct just from

704
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:34,558
the room and come down the duct and then

705
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:37,259
illuminate the whole tent because

706
00:23:34,558 --> 00:23:38,519
there's ambient light in the room so it

707
00:23:37,259 --> 00:23:40,558
could be from a lightly it could be

708
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:42,359
causing your seeds but the bottom line

709
00:23:40,558 --> 00:23:43,440
is I want to know what is causing first

710
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:44,699
of all I want to make sure these are

711
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,558
seeds then I want to know what is

712
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:48,419
causing that was it pollen was it

713
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:50,879
intersex or was it a room problem was it

714
00:23:48,419 --> 00:23:52,740
a light leak what is causing that then I

715
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,240
would make a determination if I would

716
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:56,640
run those plants any further if I'm

717
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,839
seeing seeds in week two or three I'm

718
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,940
thinking I've got more [ __ ] to worry

719
00:23:57,839 --> 00:24:02,759
about than just the strain selection but

720
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:03,779
it very well could be bad genetics I

721
00:24:02,759 --> 00:24:05,339
don't know who you're running I don't

722
00:24:03,779 --> 00:24:06,899
know what you've got I don't have that

723
00:24:05,339 --> 00:24:09,959
detail in this email this is just a

724
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:11,400
shorty so I'm going to say make make

725
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:13,140
sure that those receipts go give it a

726
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:15,480
squeeze see if that's a seat in there

727
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:17,520
then if that's a seed in there find out

728
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:19,740
if there's any pollen or intersex plants

729
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:21,240
then check on all the other parameters

730
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:23,819
in the room which I listed the vapor

731
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:26,940
pressure deficit over and under watering

732
00:24:23,819 --> 00:24:30,240
and then go in the room and turn off the

733
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:31,679
lights so when there are lights on in

734
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,120
the rest of the area so I don't know

735
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,320
your situation I don't know your house I

736
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:36,418
don't know where the grow is it could be

737
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:37,558
in the jungle it could be in the in New

738
00:24:36,419 --> 00:24:39,538
York I don't know where you're where

739
00:24:37,558 --> 00:24:42,418
you're growing right now maybe you're in

740
00:24:39,538 --> 00:24:45,000
a shed but if you've got lights in that

741
00:24:42,419 --> 00:24:47,340
room at the normal time of when that

742
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,839
tent or whatever is functioning go in

743
00:24:47,339 --> 00:24:50,759
your grow space whatever it is when

744
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:53,639
there are other lights on like daylight

745
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:55,558
outside preferably go in the tent or go

746
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:57,299
in the room and turn off all the lights

747
00:24:55,558 --> 00:24:59,579
and sit in there for long enough for

748
00:24:57,298 --> 00:25:01,079
your vision to adjust to that room if

749
00:24:59,579 --> 00:25:02,639
you can see anything in that room

750
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:04,918
there's too much light you need a

751
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,299
hundred percent Darkness I went to a

752
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:07,919
grow space one time because my friend

753
00:25:06,298 --> 00:25:10,019
told me they just won't flower properly

754
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:11,759
I don't know what's going on and I I was

755
00:25:10,019 --> 00:25:13,558
like I I really think this is a light

756
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:15,900
issue and we couldn't figure out why and

757
00:25:13,558 --> 00:25:17,339
it was daytime outside and so I said

758
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:19,019
turn off all the grow lights in here

759
00:25:17,339 --> 00:25:20,459
turn off all the lights let's see where

760
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:22,259
the light is coming in and we turned it

761
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:23,880
off and we realized a window that he had

762
00:25:22,259 --> 00:25:26,220
boarded up the light was just coming

763
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:27,900
through little pieces of the plywood and

764
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:29,940
there was just full sun coming into that

765
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:31,440
room so that means when it was dark in

766
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:33,000
that grow space whatever light was

767
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,400
happening outside if it was a porch

768
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:38,640
light if it was just the sunshine if the

769
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:40,380
lights went out before or uh after if

770
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,480
the the sunshine in the dark space

771
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:44,278
didn't come it coincided it would

772
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,019
[ __ ] interrupt the dark cycle in his

773
00:25:44,278 --> 00:25:47,940
grow space his plants were never going

774
00:25:46,019 --> 00:25:50,220
to flower we had to read dark re-black

775
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:52,259
out that section so it could be a very

776
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:53,579
well could be a light leak all right my

777
