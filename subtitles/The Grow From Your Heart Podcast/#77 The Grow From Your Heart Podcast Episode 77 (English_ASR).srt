105
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,920
I want to read that to you guys it says

106
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,878
the following video shows a raid by

107
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:52,280
Santa Ana police at the Skyhigh medical

108
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:53,639
marijuana dispensary on May 27th 2015

109
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,680
the footage has been edited by the

110
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:57,559
dispensaries attorneys the text that

111
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,200
appears in the portions of the video

112
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:01,120
also were inserted by the attorneys to

113
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:03,000
explain what they believe was occurring

114
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,400
after reviewing the photo Santa Ana's

115
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,759
police chief says he plans to

116
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,319
investigate the officer's actions so now

117
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:10,120
I'm going to hit play and I may have to

118
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:11,798
adjust the volume a couple times oh I

119
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,000
still got the reg playing from the intro

120
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:14,319
I'm going to have to adjust the volume

121
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,160
because it's a YouTube video and it gets

122
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:17,759
choppy all right before you hit play man

123
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,079
just a little background for the for

124
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:23,280
everybody listening so the city in

125
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:26,840
question here um decided that they were

126
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:30,198
going to ban all dispensaries uh at

127
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:32,399
least for now and there were a several

128
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:34,560
that have opened up had opened up

129
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:38,359
already or opened up in the face of the

130
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:41,360
ban and continued to operate so I'm not

131
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:43,000
exactly sure what steps were taken

132
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,319
before the video starts playing by the

133
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,959
city but yeah the video's nuts I'm not

134
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:49,800
trying to defend anything in it just to

135
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:51,680
give you guys a little heads up as to

136
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,000
what led up to the video hitting

137
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,519
starting all right so I'm going to hit

138
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,319
play now here we go I apologize if the

139
00:04:55,519 --> 00:05:00,478
volume's wonky you guys I'll I'll be on

140
00:04:57,319 --> 00:05:00,478
it quickly

141
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,680
all right so what's happening is that's

142
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:08,840
the battering ram on the front door so

143
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,360
let let's I'm going to hit pause and

144
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:12,279
talk about this they're battering

145
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:14,360
battering ramming the front door they're

146
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:16,599
busting in the front door right they're

147
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:18,280
hitting it with the battering ram inward

148
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,840
it is an outward pulling door if the

149
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:21,758
dude would have grabbed the handle and

150
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:23,918
pulled right it would have opened it was

151
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:26,000
unlocked it's a business that's open for

152
00:05:23,918 --> 00:05:28,120
business The View that we're seeing is

153
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,038
coming from a hidden camera and security

154
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,280
cameras the law enforcement tore down

155
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:33,159
all the cameras during the raid but

156
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:34,439
there were hidden cameras in here at the

157
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,919
advice of the attorney so if you own a

158
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:37,199
dispensary put up some hidden cameras so

159
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:39,879
that you can catch this [ __ ] if it goes

160
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:42,240
on but uh all they had to do is pull

161
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:43,199
that door open and walk in they were K

162
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,280
they were slamming the door with the

163
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,038
battering ram so all right then they

164
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:48,069

254
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:58,600
KN so then the next part is the officers

255
00:08:55,799 --> 00:09:00,159
climbing up onto the display cases oh

256
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,920

259
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,079
with a crowbar and stuff just smashing

260
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,360
security equipment because they don't

261
00:09:08,078 --> 00:09:13,759
want what's about to take place to be

262
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:14,959
recorded yeah exactly and they didn't

263
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:16,559
realize that they were on a hidden

264
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:18,039
camera which is funny this guy looked

265
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:19,919
right into it one time and didn't

266
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:22,360
realize it was a hidden camera

267
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:25,240
dispensary had two two layers of camera

268
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:27,399
so cops completely missed layer number

269
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,839
two it's a nice looking shop too

270
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:30,559
wherever this place was they had several

271
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:32,240
jars it's a well set up place they got a

272
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:33,838

275
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:41,120

cameras it's a 7-minute video guys and

280
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:49,199

281
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:51,879
majority of it here while we talk about

282

288
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:03,600
watching the monitor to see where the

289
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,399

307
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:45,078
the cameras and disconnected the DVR so

308
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:48,679
they don't think anybody can see them

309
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:51,719
now so now all the masks come off yes

390
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:44,120
consumer there's so much Disturbing

391
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:45,439
Behavior packed in such a short video he

392
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:47,839

looks like uh let's see if he does I'm

396
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,120
assuming that that's about what's what's

397
00:13:53,078 --> 00:13:57,359
about to happen but I can't promise you

398
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,919
that's my presumption he put something

399
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,680
in a bag and he's walking off a camera

400
00:13:58,919 --> 00:14:02,519

401
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:04,239
bag to me no it was a bag from the

402
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:06,240
dispensary yeah it looks like it looks

403
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:09,360
like a checkout bag that I fill all day

sort there's definitely going to be

409

medical marijuana dispensary um I can't

433
00:15:09,078 --> 00:15:13,000
remember I think it was just a regular

434
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,519
random police officer and then the city

435
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,000

436
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:20,240

00:15:46,318 --> 00:15:50,759
protect their identity while they

451
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:52,199
destroyed property in a random business

452
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:54,079
they didn't need to feel intimidating

453
00:15:52,198 --> 00:15:55,519
they didn't need to waste 12 officers

454
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:57,198
time they didn't need to [ __ ] up our

455
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:59,440
days they came in and said you guys are

456
00:15:57,198 --> 00:16:01,439
fired basically yep they walked in and

457
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,199

said and that was the end of it I mean

460
00:16:05,318 --> 00:16:10,000
they didn't raid or smash or steal

461
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:12,000
anything and yeah there's no absolutely

462
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,839
no need for this on behalf of the city

463
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,159
and now we've got dispensaries 10 miles

464
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:18,079

465
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:19,879
right pretty stupid right on pelo good

466
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:21,278

467
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:22,639
dude I want to see how this turns out

468
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:25,399
don't let these cops get away with this

469
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:27,079
those guys if you sent them there to

470
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:29,440
take down this dispensary because

471
00:16:27,078 --> 00:16:31,318
cannabis is federally illegal by eating

472
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,880
the evidence there they definitely

473
00:16:31,318 --> 00:16:36,000
committed a huge crime right if I had

474
00:16:33,879 --> 00:16:38,639
done that if you it's so bizarre if you

475
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,120
caught me destroying evidence on camera

476
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:43,799

477
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,879
video that really pissed me off and I

478
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:47,639
knew I had to share it like everywhere I

479
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:50,559
possibly could was right at the end of

480
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:52,720
the video the fire department shows up

481
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:55,078

482
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,920

fire department they're essentially the

486
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:06,640
like Batman and [ __ ] Robin right why

487
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:10,038
why would the fire department seeing and

488
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:12,280
hearing the police do doing police work

489
00:17:10,038 --> 00:17:13,439
or business be a bad thing why why would

490
00:17:12,279 --> 00:17:15,399
they have to watch their mouth around

491
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,480
the fire department y what's with that

492
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,319
maybe there's something is it because

493
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,798
you're stealing is it because you're

494
00:17:18,318 --> 00:17:22,399
eating Edibles on the job you can't

495
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:24,720
drink on the job I'm pretty sure you

496
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,679
can't consume cannabis on the job yeah

497
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:29,919
if you're a if you're a cop raing a

498
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:32,000
place you shouldn't be consuming any

499
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:33,960
because then you're a hypocritic prick

500
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,759
well no it's theft well yeah but then

501

00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:29,000
what cannabis might do for them and so

579
00:20:26,679 --> 00:20:30,960
there's a lot of people out there that

580
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,440
know it's a about a lot more than just

581
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:35,840
getting high but even if it's just about

582
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:38,038
getting high for you that's fine humans

583
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:39,839
have enjoyed in toxicants since before

584
00:20:38,038 --> 00:20:42,119
we had like a

585
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:43,759
society I mean even little kids spin

586
00:20:42,119 --> 00:20:46,000
around in circles to break free of

587
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:47,960
reality for a minute and enjoy it I mean

588
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,079
it's just something humans like and

589
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:52,558
cannabis is great for that it's the

590
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:54,720
safest intoxicant known to man every

591
00:20:52,558 --> 00:20:57,158
other intoxicant causes a lot of harm to

592
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,120
your body cannabis doesn't the feds have

593
00:20:57,159 --> 00:21:00,600
been looking for a long time folks when

594
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:02,439
you start doing your research you're

595
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:05,240
going to learn that as far as

596
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:07,840
intoxicants Go I mean even just beer and

597
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:10,440
alcohol cannabis is far far safer so if

598
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:12,519
you just prefer it over alcohol that's

599
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:14,679
still a great reason to stand up and say

600
00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:16,720
hey we need to legalize this in my area

601
00:21:14,679 --> 00:21:18,080
you don't have to be super sick I'm

602
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,558
gonna take a dab because Mike's got a

603
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:21,000
lot to say I usually don't get to dab so

604
00:21:19,558 --> 00:21:23,079
hard on the show keep going bro I like

605
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,599
it all right so now you you've got that

606
00:21:23,079 --> 00:21:28,079
spark lit you you know what what really

607
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:30,959
turns you on about cannabis it's time to

608
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:32,960
start getting educated you need to start

609
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,720
learning a couple of different things

610
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:38,880
one start researching cannabis it's got

611
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:40,839
a long and interesting history it's get

612
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:44,159
uh at this point in time the medical

613
00:21:40,839 --> 00:21:46,038
research and the research on safety for

614
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:48,760
consumption even if you're smoking big

615
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:50,400
old fat joints all the time vaporizers

616
00:21:48,759 --> 00:21:52,319
are a lot healthier way to consume you

617
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,880
get to skip that burning plant material

618
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:55,759
but even if you're puffing Jay's old

619
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:57,440
school you're not doing the kind of

620
00:21:55,759 --> 00:22:00,319
damage to your body that a tobacco

621
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:02,919
smoker is it's not a onetoone comparison

622
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:04,558
folks get uh get online and start

623
00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:06,240
learning everything you can about

624
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:09,119
cannabis you don't have to sit down and

625
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:11,480
do it all at once but I mean if you love

626
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:13,158
cannabis learning a lot about it and

627
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:15,079
knowing that you're not killing yourself

628
00:22:13,159 --> 00:22:16,919
because you enjoy it that's something

629
00:22:15,079 --> 00:22:18,399
that everybody should want to do all

630
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:20,640
right so while you're learning about

631
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:23,080
cannabis start learning about the laws

632
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:26,400
in your area if you're in the United

633
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:29,240
States um the internet uh every local

634
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:31,960
government regardless of how small town

635
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:34,278
or area you live in everything's online

636
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:36,480
at this point find out when the meetings

637
00:22:34,278 --> 00:22:38,400
are happening how that government

638
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:41,120
structured if it's a city council or if

639
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:43,080
it's a board of County Commissioners or

640
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:45,119
uh whatnot figure out when they meet and

641
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:47,960
just start going to meetings sit in the

642
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:50,079
back and just observe how they play out

643
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:52,360
one of the things that I laugh a lot

644
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:53,918
about the anti-pot groups down here

645
00:22:52,359 --> 00:22:56,278
never did this step they just started

646
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:57,880
showing up to meetings and shouting [ __ ]

647
00:22:56,278 --> 00:22:59,038
and when you don't know how the meetings

648
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:01,159
function

649
00:22:59,038 --> 00:23:03,798
you don't know where to put your effort

650
00:23:01,159 --> 00:23:05,320
it's sort of like I don't know an idiot

651
00:23:03,798 --> 00:23:07,119
showing up the first day on the job and

652
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:08,879
just tackling random things in the store

653
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:10,519
like it's not helpful no matter how much

654
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:13,360
energy or passion you're throwing into

655
00:23:10,519 --> 00:23:15,079
it um but if you take a couple of a

656
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:16,798
really long boring nights these meetings

657
00:23:15,079 --> 00:23:19,720
can go for two or three hours at a stin

658
00:23:16,798 --> 00:23:22,839
and just see how they flow um all of

659
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:25,278
them allow Democratic participation any

660
00:23:22,839 --> 00:23:27,119
member of the public can show up and if

661
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:30,038
they follow a couple of really simple

662
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:31,399
easy rules like sign up and then speak

663
00:23:30,038 --> 00:23:34,679
during the appropriate time of the

664
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:36,640
meeting I mean really simple [ __ ] you

665
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:38,200
can get up and say whatever you want as

666
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,880
long as you're not cussing at somebody

667
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:42,080
or screaming and yelling at somebody on

668
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:43,919
counsil they'll let you rant about

669
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:45,720
whatever they give you five full minutes

670
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,919
don't they maybe six you get five

671
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:48,759
minutes at the beginning of every

672
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:51,679
meeting down here in PUO you just sign

673
00:23:48,759 --> 00:23:53,798
up they allow six people to sign up

674
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:55,400
every meeting and you can rant about

675
00:23:53,798 --> 00:23:57,200
whatever and for the most part it's

676
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,759
these three old guys that just show up

677
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,400
and [ __ ] I was going to say some times

678
00:23:58,759 --> 00:24:03,919
nobody signs up everyone on Council down

679
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:06,320
here has thanked me for breaking up the

680
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:07,919
tedm of the couple people that speak

681
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:10,480
they don't all agree with me but they

682
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:13,320
appreciate me going and saying something

683
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,798
coherent um and they're down to hear

684
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:16,960
whatever there are people that have come

685
00:24:14,798 --> 00:24:19,639
and spoke out about roadside memorials I

686
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:21,278
mean whatever issue interests you you

687
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:23,600
can go down and speak about so if your

688
00:24:21,278 --> 00:24:26,000
issue is cannabis you can show up to

689
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:27,480
your local Town Council and if you've

690
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,240
done your homework a little bit you can

691
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,960
point out how many millions of dollars

692
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:34,120
they could make if cannabis was legal in

693
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:35,960
their area um if you take the time to

694
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:38,759
pull the data coming out of Colorado and

695
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:41,079
Washington State it's been 18 months

696
00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:43,278
since recreational stores were open

697
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:46,119
their doors in Colorado we've got all

698
00:24:43,278 --> 00:24:48,679
the data we need to prove just how safe

699
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:50,918
cannabis legalization is you can have

700
00:24:48,679 --> 00:24:53,080
stores that adults 21 years of age or

701
00:24:50,919 --> 00:24:54,799
older can walk into if you throw the

702
00:24:53,079 --> 00:24:57,639
[ __ ] in well-labeled childproof

703
00:24:54,798 --> 00:25:00,679
packaging it's perfectly safe there's no

704
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:04,159
harm caus there's no increase in any

705
00:25:00,679 --> 00:25:05,919
DUIs or teen access I mean there's so

706
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:08,240
much cannabis out there anyway all the

707
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:11,038
stores do is change who profits from the

708
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:13,319
sale and where a whole bunch of adults

709
00:25:11,038 --> 00:25:15,158
choose to go to buy their weed like

710
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:17,599
legalization isn't a huge Earth

711
00:25:15,159 --> 00:25:20,919
shattering change it's just the end of a

712
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:22,759
lot of stupidity yes and in Colorado

713
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:24,399
we've been keeping tally of the numbers

714
00:25:22,759 --> 00:25:26,640
people have been watching very closely

715
00:25:24,398 --> 00:25:29,519
this was supposed to be a nightmare all

716
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:31,960
of the predictions a year or two ago are

717
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:35,519
laughable now the local paper the

718
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:37,720
chieftain does a [ __ ] job regularly and

719
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:40,158
miracle and miracles they did an amazing

720
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:43,200
expose on what legal marijuana did to

721
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:45,080
our County we sold $17 Million worth of

722
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:50,600
marijuana and the cops can't point to a

723
00:25:45,079 --> 00:25:52,759
firm problem it's just nuts $17 million

724
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:54,079
there's only 150,000 people down here I

725
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:56,640
mean do the

726
00:25:54,079 --> 00:25:59,439
math and it's not like the black market

727
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:01,679
died it's just a huge number of people

728
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:03,480
prefer going to the stores buying weed

729
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:06,320
on the black market can be a nightmare

730
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:07,720
man I mean we're so spoiled in Colorado

731
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:10,558
it's kind of hard to think back to what

732
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:13,399
it used to be like yeah but a lot of

733
00:26:10,558 --> 00:26:15,278
people have a a hardcore dealer that

734
00:26:13,398 --> 00:26:17,359
they've got to deal with they they

735
00:26:15,278 --> 00:26:18,960
operate under deal dealer rules like you

736
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:20,879
meet in a parking lot it's a quick

737
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:23,000
exchange you're not friends you get

738
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:26,440
ripped off the bags light it's got other

739
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:29,720
crap in it it's never The Strain they

740
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:31,960
say cops looking to you for doing it I

741
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:33,399
had some friends in from Wisconsin uh

742
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:35,720
they're like friends of a friend my good

743
00:26:33,398 --> 00:26:37,000
friend had family in from Wisconsin and

744
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:38,600

yeah they wanted to go to that place cuz

748
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,278
they heard a lot about it and wanted to

749
00:26:42,398 --> 00:26:46,000
see what it was like and I was like they

750
00:26:44,278 --> 00:26:47,679
just wanted the experience of going

751
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,359
through the store all right keep going

752
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:53,360
I've got you off track now so get

753
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:55,319
educated learn the laws in your area how

754
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:58,959
the public meetings work and when and

755
00:26:55,319 --> 00:27:01,038
how public comment is taken and then n

756
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:03,278
look up other legalization groups in

757
00:27:01,038 --> 00:27:06,759
your area guys there are a ton of groups

758
00:27:03,278 --> 00:27:09,759
out there um in the 1970s we were really

759
00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:12,519
close to Mar marijuana being legal too

760
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:14,440
and when that fell apart a number of

761
00:27:12,519 --> 00:27:16,000
groups started forming nationally

762
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:18,240
normal's the big one that's what I just

763

772
00:27:33,159 --> 00:27:38,720
laws um I think they helped with

773
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:39,720
Colorado's they um helped with Alaska um

774
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,600

797
00:28:33,398 --> 00:28:38,599
15 minutes um it's a great place to

798
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:40,278
start guys and the the last organization

799
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:43,079
I'd say uh everybody needs to check out

800
00:28:40,278 --> 00:28:44,720
is a group called flex your rights um if

801
00:28:43,079 --> 00:28:47,480
you're going to go and start speaking up

802
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:50,159
about marijuana legalization in an area

803
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:51,759
where it's not already medically legal

804
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:55,200
or there's not a number of other people

805
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:56,558
doing that it can be terrifying and one

806
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,759
of the things that's really going to

807
00:28:56,558 --> 00:29:00,879
help you feel a lot more secure and

808
00:28:58,759 --> 00:29:02,798
doing that is knowing what your rights

809
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:05,200

States of America truth flex your rights

as an organization of defense attorneys

812
00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:13,558
that have put together a number of great

813
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:16,200
videos and little um training web pages

814
00:29:13,558 --> 00:29:17,558
on flexing your rights what rights do

815
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,360
you have when the cop pounds on your

816
00:29:17,558 --> 00:29:21,720
door and says open up

817
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:23,278
police what can you do is we should all

818
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,519
watch that anyway everybody should

819
00:29:23,278 --> 00:29:26,240
everyone that's listening right now

820
00:29:24,519 --> 00:29:27,480
should pull up these videos what are

821
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:30,240
your rights when you get pulled over

822
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:32,079
during a tra trffic stop I mean I'll if

823
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:34,640
you get on YouTube and watch some of the

824
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:36,639
same [ __ ] I do you've seen people refuse

825
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:39,159
to roll their window down and just hand

826
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:41,200
or put up IDs to the window and

827
00:29:39,159 --> 00:29:42,960
completely refuse what the cops saying

828
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,880
and just do something different and the

829
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:47,440
cops all look befuddled and then the

830
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:49,159
important cop walks over tells the other

831
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,519
cops they don't get to smash the window

832
00:29:49,159 --> 00:29:52,840
and they don't get to ruin this guy's

833
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:55,519
night and the guy's free to leave learn

834
00:29:52,839 --> 00:29:57,678
how to do that legally I know it's

835
00:29:55,519 --> 00:29:59,480
terrifying just stand up in front of the

836
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:01,399
police Chief cuz the police chief's at a

837
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:03,720
lot of these meetings the city council's

838
00:30:01,398 --> 00:30:05,479
at these meetings the City attorney

839
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,880
everyone's in a suit and tie there are

840
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:10,480
cameras rolling and you're going to

841
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:13,278
stand up and encourage them to legalize

842
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:15,440
marijuana or to push for legalization it

843
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:17,240
can be really scary but if you know your

844
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:19,558
rights and you've paid attention in the

845
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:21,159
meetings and you know how they flow and

846
00:30:19,558 --> 00:30:23,720
you make your argument at the

847
00:30:21,159 --> 00:30:25,159
appropriate time the appropriate way

848
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:27,200
they're going to hear you they're going

849
00:30:25,159 --> 00:30:28,480
to be impressed and they're going to

850
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,880
want to know more

851
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,599
and so if you've done your homework and

852
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:33,240
you're educated when they come up to you

853
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:35,719
after the meeting and go I like what you

854
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:38,200
said can we sit down later I want to

855
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:41,679
hear about what pot legalization might

856
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:43,880
do for our little town here in Kentucky

857
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:46,519
you can go to lunch later and really

858
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:49,440
explain okay in Colorado Town's this

859
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:51,558
size that allowed this many shops made

860
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:54,639
this much in tax revenue this much in

861
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:56,839
application fees they spent this much in

862
00:30:54,638 --> 00:30:58,798
enforcement and so they're able to spend

863
00:30:56,839 --> 00:31:01,439
an extra this much on their roads this

864
00:30:58,798 --> 00:31:03,720
year when you make that argument to

865
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:05,840
someone in local government they're

866
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:08,278
going to just be

867
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:10,240
astounded at the possibilities they're

868
00:31:08,278 --> 00:31:14,240
going to have to look at this issue in a

869
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:16,638
new way $17 million is an issue peblo is

870
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:19,399
a poor town like half the people down

871
00:31:16,638 --> 00:31:20,519
here are on some form of assistance it's

872
00:31:19,398 --> 00:31:24,558
actually like

873
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:28,079
60% um the median income down here is

874
00:31:24,558 --> 00:31:29,480
like 14 Grand a year and yeah Jeff just

875
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:32,439
looked at me a little horrified I was a

876
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:35,240
little shocked too um and yeah it's a

877
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:37,278
big city full of a lot of people and

878
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:39,919
hard times so this industry's been huge

879
00:31:37,278 --> 00:31:43,240
the jobs yeah the local investment in

880
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:45,880
the city um hop on the chief and if you

881
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:47,399
go to the chieftain.com and scroll all

882
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:49,600
the way down to the bottom of the page

883
00:31:47,398 --> 00:31:51,879
on the right hand side they've got a

884
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:54,158
couple of big exposes they've done and

885
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:55,360
one of them's called the growing trade

886
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:57,080
or I suppose you could just Google the

887
00:31:55,359 --> 00:32:00,199
chief in the growing trade it brings up

888
00:31:57,079 --> 00:32:01,879
a big series reports and they break down

889
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:05,080
what the police had to say after the

890
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:06,960
county sold 17 million in pot last year

891
00:32:05,079 --> 00:32:09,119
what the teachers had to say in the

892
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:12,278
principles what the fire department had

893
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:14,599
to say um they tallied up what the

894
00:32:12,278 --> 00:32:16,359
county spent on enforcement and going

895
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:18,000
out and making sure that you met zoning

896
00:32:16,359 --> 00:32:19,678
and that you were checking IDs and all

897
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,119
of that they added up everything they

898
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:24,080
could think of that was related to legal

899
00:32:22,119 --> 00:32:27,000
pot and they tallied it in one column

900
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:29,000
and it was like 220 Grand and they

901
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,240
pulled in 1 . 7

902
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,720
million I mean that's a million and a

903
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:36,240
half return a huge return on a small

904
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:37,600
investment yep I mean all they had to do

905
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:40,000
was get out of the way and I also think

906
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:41,599
that we're bringing more people here

907
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,880
because or I know we're bringing people

908
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:46,879
here the Colorado's seeing a a flood of

909
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,720
people coming it's almost like the gold

910
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:50,880
rushes before not just moving but

911
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:54,000
visiting they're coming to like just

912
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:55,519
come bag of weed and go on a hike lots

913
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,440
of people coming to visit and checking

914
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:59,120
out and what I'm hoping they all take

915
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:02,240
home is when they get home they need to

916
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:04,319
tell everyone they know how sane and

917
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:05,798
rational this decision was I mean a lot

918
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:07,720
of people were shocked oh my God you're

919
00:33:05,798 --> 00:33:10,079
going to add another legal intoxicant to

920
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:12,440
the mix it's going to be terrible for

921
00:33:10,079 --> 00:33:14,519
society I mean marijuana's never killed

922
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:16,000
anyone alcohol kills almost 100,000

923
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:18,798
people a year and that's before the car

924
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,960
crashes tobacco kills almost half a

925
00:33:18,798 --> 00:33:24,359
million people every year and that's

926
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:26,360
from using getting diseases from using

927
00:33:24,359 --> 00:33:28,079
and dying police kill more people than

928
00:33:26,359 --> 00:33:30,558
cannabis

929
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:32,278
500 already this year just just cuz I

930
00:33:30,558 --> 00:33:34,558
know that that off the top of my head

931
00:33:32,278 --> 00:33:37,038
yeah um peanuts kill more people than

932
00:33:34,558 --> 00:33:39,638
cannabis every year lightning kills 52

933
00:33:37,038 --> 00:33:41,359
Americans a year I was just had to look

934
00:33:39,638 --> 00:33:42,519
that [ __ ] up recently all right we're

935
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:43,599

936
00:33:42,519 --> 00:33:45,000
because you got quite a bit of [ __ ] you

937
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:47,798
on 36 minutes I want to make sure you

938
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:50,119
get this in all right so we're

939
00:33:47,798 --> 00:33:51,918
passionate we're educated we've started

940
00:33:50,119 --> 00:33:53,759
attending meetings and figuring out how

941
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:55,720
they work all right so you're going to

942
00:33:53,759 --> 00:33:58,440
start speaking

943
00:33:55,720 --> 00:34:01,319
out this is the terrifying part like

944
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:04,080
it's easy to sit at home and Google um

945
00:34:01,319 --> 00:34:07,240
does cannabis cure cancer and then read

946
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:09,039
what Dr tashin has to say about that or

947
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:10,559
to Google the history of cannabis and

948
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:11,838
spend the night reading about how the

949
00:34:10,559 --> 00:34:14,000
federal governments run a medical

950
00:34:11,838 --> 00:34:16,398
marijuana program every year I've

951
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:19,079
[ __ ] been alive it started in 1982

952
00:34:16,398 --> 00:34:20,719
people um they mail people 11 ounces of

953
00:34:19,079 --> 00:34:23,519
weed how the [ __ ] did you not know about

954
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:26,000
this Google it right now but that's easy

955
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:28,599
it's not scary no one's going to follow

956
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,838
you home from that but but going down to

957
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:33,200
city council and standing up at the

958
00:34:30,838 --> 00:34:35,279
podium and swearing in giving your name

959
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:37,878
an address and then speaking out for

960
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:40,320
legalization can be scary but if you do

961
00:34:37,878 --> 00:34:41,838
it right you're going to succeed people

962
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:44,440
are going to hear you no one's going to

963
00:34:41,838 --> 00:34:46,878
follow you home like it's even like an

964
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:48,480
extra layer of protection because if the

965
00:34:46,878 --> 00:34:50,078
cops are going to screw with the person

966
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:53,358
that's going to city council and making

967
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:55,000
a stink it's going to be press and do

968
00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:58,519
the cops want press they're going to

969
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:00,159
bring you know the district attorney and

970
00:34:58,519 --> 00:35:02,199
any press right now they don't want any

971
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:03,920
of that so they pretty much leave you

972
00:35:02,199 --> 00:35:06,960
alone I've never had an issue and I've

973
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:09,119
been doing this for like 6 years now so

974
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:11,119
what you got to do is figure out what

975
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:15,000
you want to say and how you want to say

976
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:17,160
it are you talking about medical access

977
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,760
are you talking about full-blown

978
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:22,679
legalization take a few

979
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:25,240
minutes and really pen out what you want

980
00:35:22,679 --> 00:35:27,799
to say make a couple of bullet point

981
00:35:25,239 --> 00:35:30,358
notes of points you want to hit and then

982
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:32,039
practice it a couple of times at home

983
00:35:30,358 --> 00:35:34,000
get yourself familiar with it cuz it can

984
00:35:32,039 --> 00:35:35,559
be really nerve-wracking I hate public

985
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,280
speaking I'm nervous sitting here on the

986
00:35:35,559 --> 00:35:39,199
podcast and I love it in your kitchen

987
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,720
you'll get shaky the first time uh but I

988
00:35:39,199 --> 00:35:42,279
hear a lot of people get shaky and city

989
00:35:40,719 --> 00:35:43,799
council knows they look at you like it's

990
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:46,000
all right dude you can they're used to

991
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:48,200
it and and if you're struggling they'll

992
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,719
even like it's okay you can say whatever

993
00:35:48,199 --> 00:35:51,039
you want you can't get in trouble here

994
00:35:49,719 --> 00:35:52,639
like they try to reassure you a little

995
00:35:51,039 --> 00:35:53,719
bit even if they disagree with you if

996
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:56,920
they see that you're nervous they're

997
00:35:53,719 --> 00:35:58,399
really nice about it usually but uh plan

998
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:00,760
out what you want to say practice it a

999
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:04,079
couple of times at home and then go down

1000
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:05,800
to the meeting or uh just throw on clean

1001
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:07,880
clothes like that's the key people you

1002
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:10,960
don't have to dress way up I I go in

1003
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:13,119
jeans and a button- down shirt take your

1004
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:15,199
hat comb your hair take off your hat

1005
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:17,640
look decent if you've got dreads tie

1006
00:36:15,199 --> 00:36:19,719
them back neat if you've got a big beard

1007
00:36:17,639 --> 00:36:21,838
maybe clean it up a little bit but just

1008
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:23,679
clean clothes look nice you don't have

1009
00:36:21,838 --> 00:36:25,318
to go buy a suit or anything honestly

1010
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:26,919
there are some guys that come in there

1011
00:36:25,318 --> 00:36:28,960
looking like they just and they're

1012
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:30,838
wearing their work uniform you can and

1013
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,440
they're like hey I'm part of this Union

1014
00:36:30,838 --> 00:36:34,199
and you're like oh I could tell but

1015
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:35,800
they're like and we feel this way and I

1016
00:36:34,199 --> 00:36:37,318
think that that shows that they're a

1017
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:39,039
working [ __ ] man and that they're

1018
00:36:37,318 --> 00:36:40,679
speaking about what they've got to do

1019
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:42,599
you know what I mean right if you're

1020
00:36:40,679 --> 00:36:43,960
coming straight from work it's perfectly

1021
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:45,599
appropriate to show up and whatever you

1022
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:46,599
were wearing at work that day people do

1023
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:48,359
that all the time cuz most of these

1024
00:36:46,599 --> 00:36:49,599
meetings are at like 6:00 at night and

1025
00:36:48,358 --> 00:36:52,039
that's pretty much when everybody's

1026
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:53,680
headed home if you've got a normal job

1027
00:36:52,039 --> 00:36:55,599
so just throw on something clean if you

1028
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:57,199
can get yourself cleaned up a little bit

1029
00:36:55,599 --> 00:37:00,400
practice what you're going to say then

1030
00:36:57,199 --> 00:37:02,439
go down sign up and say it so uh yeah

1031
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:06,440
throw on a clean shirt go down and go

1032
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:08,159
down sign up and speak um be polite I I

1033
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:11,920
like to start off with good evening

1034
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:14,719
counsil um I think going like gentleman

1035
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:16,358
and Lady makes you sound like a dick so

1036
00:37:14,719 --> 00:37:18,000
if there's you know men and women on the

1037
00:37:16,358 --> 00:37:20,239
council you can just skip all of that

1038
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,719
nonsense with good evening Council or

1039
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:23,799
good evening board County Commissioners

1040
00:37:21,719 --> 00:37:25,719
just use their formal title and then say

1041
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:27,800
what you've got to say and then at the

1042
00:37:25,719 --> 00:37:29,598
end try to say thank you for uh thank

1043
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:31,039
you for you know giving me this chance

1044
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:32,920
to speak tonight they really appreciate

1045
00:37:31,039 --> 00:37:35,159
it when people thank them and then hang

1046
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:37,318
out at the meeting like that's the part

1047
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:41,078
that everyone regardless of their issue

1048
00:37:37,318 --> 00:37:45,400
skips the night you go speak at the

1049
00:37:41,079 --> 00:37:47,599
meeting nine times out of 10 um when the

1050
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:50,119
the section of time where the public can

1051
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:52,119
speak is over everyone in the meeting

1052
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:54,280
shuffles out the city council down here

1053
00:37:52,119 --> 00:37:56,640
even pauses for a minute to allow it to

1054
00:37:54,280 --> 00:38:00,160
happen but the very next step of the

1055
00:37:56,639 --> 00:38:02,159
meeting is Council commentary well where

1056
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:04,480
they sit and banter back and forth for a

1057
00:38:02,159 --> 00:38:06,199
few minutes about what they just heard

1058
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:09,440
and about other [ __ ] that's come up that

1059
00:38:06,199 --> 00:38:12,879
week and that's the important part of

1060
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:15,880
the meeting if you're arguing with them

1061
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:18,559
about anything knowing the issues city

1062
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:20,318
council cares about knowing the

1063
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:22,799
different projects they're working on in

1064
00:38:20,318 --> 00:38:25,358
the city knowing out of the hundreds of

1065
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:27,000
emails they get each week which one or

1066
00:38:25,358 --> 00:38:29,000
two they choose to bring up at city

1067
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:31,719
council as though it's a folky [ __ ]

1068
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,960
antidote like knowing that stuff helps

1069
00:38:31,719 --> 00:38:35,879
you structure your argument maybe it'll

1070
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:38,199
help you uh figure out which one of

1071
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:40,200
those council members is on your side

1072
00:38:38,199 --> 00:38:42,000
and you can kind of Buddy up with them

1073
00:38:40,199 --> 00:38:43,919
especially after you've spoken because

1074
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,400
they frequently discuss what they heard

1075
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,480
that night before and I can't tell you

1076
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:49,318
how many times I've heard I wish the

1077
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:51,599
person who spoke earlier was still in

1078
00:38:49,318 --> 00:38:53,358
this room because we'd like to thank him

1079
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:55,400
for coming and speaking out you know and

1080
00:38:53,358 --> 00:38:57,519
we know it's tough to do and d d da the

1081
00:38:55,400 --> 00:39:00,358
last one was this this really sweet kid

1082
00:38:57,519 --> 00:39:01,759
he was super nervous he kept stopping um

1083
00:39:00,358 --> 00:39:03,559
I heard him talking before the meeting

1084
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,599
he didn't have a stammer he fully had a

1085
00:39:03,559 --> 00:39:07,078
stammer while he was testifying and he

1086
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:10,480
was talking about the Homeless Problem

1087
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:13,318
down here and uh he left immediately

1088
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:16,519
after he spoke and the council spent

1089
00:39:13,318 --> 00:39:18,400
maybe 20 minutes debating the issue and

1090
00:39:16,519 --> 00:39:20,199
Gathering City res or asking the city

1091
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,960
manager about resources to help the kid

1092
00:39:20,199 --> 00:39:24,358
with his issue or to address some of the

1093
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,760
issues the kid brought up and it would

1094
00:39:24,358 --> 00:39:27,400
have been great if he was there for that

1095
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,400
but he was already gone he was gone and

1096
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:31,119
I doubt he'll pull it up online later uh

1097
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:33,240
I've been there when they've called upon

1098
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:34,640
you to answer a cannabis question

1099
00:39:33,239 --> 00:39:36,118
they're like Michael are you here or the

1100
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:37,719
one guy's like that guy over there knows

1101
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:40,000
let him speak and you just stand up and

1102
00:39:37,719 --> 00:39:41,318
you're like the answer is this yep and

1103
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,079
the people look at you like you're a

1104
00:39:41,318 --> 00:39:46,000
[ __ ] robot so become you guys can all

1105
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:48,440
become that guy for counsel and don't

1106
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,639
expect it to happen uh overnight I've

1107
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:53,358
been watching Mike do this for probably

1108
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:56,519
eight years it takes a lot of time folks

1109
00:39:53,358 --> 00:39:59,679
it when you first go at best you're the

1110
00:39:56,519 --> 00:40:02,599
articulate guy talking about weed the

1111
00:39:59,679 --> 00:40:04,318
fifth time you go and speak You're the

1112
00:40:02,599 --> 00:40:06,119
really articulate guy who comes to

1113
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:08,318
meetings and knows what he's talking

1114
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:10,640
about and it's he really seems to know

1115
00:40:08,318 --> 00:40:12,440
you know he's presenting an argument in

1116
00:40:10,639 --> 00:40:14,400
a way that a lot of people are really

1117
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:17,440
starting to listen to and after the

1118
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:19,838
first year or so you're the person they

1119
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:22,000
think of when that issue comes up I

1120
00:40:19,838 --> 00:40:24,920
should get a hold of that guy and ask

1121
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,480
him what his take on this issue is now I

1122
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:29,480
get two or three calls a week from

1123
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:31,159
reporters down here here um some of

1124
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:33,800
sometimes factchecking a story they're

1125
00:40:31,159 --> 00:40:36,118
doing sometimes asking for my take on an

1126
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:38,160
issue um I'm forever run into the news

1127
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:39,559
or run to the news stand to grab a paper

1128
00:40:38,159 --> 00:40:41,318
like it's just something that comes up

1129
00:40:39,559 --> 00:40:42,639
after you start doing it for a while uh

1130
00:40:41,318 --> 00:40:44,199
we'll be in the car and both of our

1131
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:46,879
phones will ring and it's the same

1132
00:40:44,199 --> 00:40:48,838
reporter texting us both like and I'm

1133
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,000
like do you know someone who can blank

1134
00:40:48,838 --> 00:40:51,559
and we both look at each other and

1135
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,400
chuckle yeah what's the answer to this

1136
00:40:51,559 --> 00:40:55,239
odd cannabis question I've been in the

1137
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:56,400
car with Mike and city council members

1138
00:40:55,239 --> 00:40:59,559
have called him he's like turn down the

1139
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:01,400
music dude I got the ray full of blast

1140
00:40:59,559 --> 00:41:04,318
and he's like um this is a council

1141
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:07,400
member you'll have to turn that down it

1142
00:41:04,318 --> 00:41:10,279
the meetings are real formal and there's

1143
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:11,880
it's so procedural and there's police

1144
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:14,240
officers and the heads of the city or

1145
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:19,280
the town or whatever there so it seems

1146
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:21,078
really rigid and kind of terrifying but

1147
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:23,640
once you've gone a few times you see

1148
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:25,720
that it's just bored politicians who

1149
00:41:23,639 --> 00:41:29,279
desperately want someone else to give a

1150
00:41:25,719 --> 00:41:31,039
[ __ ] and they're super happy to have

1151
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,599
anyone come down to the meetings and be

1152
00:41:31,039 --> 00:41:34,159
interested the whole time the only

1153
00:41:32,599 --> 00:41:35,880
people that are there are paid to be

1154
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:38,559
there or people that are asking for

1155
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:42,039
something when you start showing up is

1156
00:41:38,559 --> 00:41:44,279
the guy saying I've done my homework I

1157
00:41:42,039 --> 00:41:48,599
figured out that marijuana legalization

1158
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:51,160
could save our County $100,000 and make

1159
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:54,640
our County $200,000 on top of that so

1160
00:41:51,159 --> 00:41:56,838
it's 300 grand total they freak the [ __ ]

1161
00:41:54,639 --> 00:41:59,199
out everybody else goes here's my issue

1162
00:41:56,838 --> 00:42:02,199
I need 10 grand here's my issue I need

1163
00:41:59,199 --> 00:42:04,919
35 Grand or even 50 bucks the youth

1164
00:42:02,199 --> 00:42:07,000
center needs another $3,000 the parking

1165
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:09,039
thing needs this much yep I've seen it

1166
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,760
when you show up and say I found a way

1167
00:42:09,039 --> 00:42:13,759
for you to make a huge amount of money

1168
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:16,280
or to a way to bring a whole bunch of

1169
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:18,960
jobs to our area I mean when you tail

1170
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:20,760
your argument well you can really hit

1171
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,760
these people in ways that they're going

1172
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:24,720
to go home thinking about Mike is giving

1173
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:27,480
you guys like 12 good points to make the

1174
00:42:24,719 --> 00:42:29,078
tax money that it's bringing in the a

1175
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:30,480
jobs that it's gonna make Mike has

1176
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:32,880
already gotten you guys a bunch of Head

1177
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:34,400
Starts color I mean 10 years ago when I

1178
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:37,119
was studying the stuff in college it was

1179
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:39,079
all theoretical we could guess what

1180
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:41,440
legalization might do to an area we

1181
00:42:39,079 --> 00:42:43,280
could look at Amsterdam and kind of

1182
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:46,760
guesstimate what that would look like in

1183
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:50,240
Denver but it's been 15 years since our

1184
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:52,160
medical marijuana laws passed 2008 was

1185
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:54,639
the dispensary explosion with the

1186
00:42:52,159 --> 00:42:57,440
medical marijuana Heyday that we always

1187
00:42:54,639 --> 00:43:01,719
talk about on the show that was 2008

1188
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:03,480
seven years ago wow and so the data

1189
00:43:01,719 --> 00:43:06,000
that's been collected over all the time

1190
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:08,079
all that time the cops were sure this

1191
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,079
was going to lead to the apocalypse the

1192
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:12,079
rehab industry was sure this was going

1193
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:14,839
to lead to the apocalypse the government

1194
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:17,200
was sure and so everybody was keeping

1195
00:43:14,838 --> 00:43:19,400
records the Department of Revenue in

1196
00:43:17,199 --> 00:43:22,279
Colorado you can go on their website and

1197
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:24,800
look pull the tax numbers by County man

1198
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:26,559
you can see what the 1% Kickback that

1199
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:28,839
the generating area gets from the state

1200
00:43:26,559 --> 00:43:31,359
adds up to to for every little town that

1201
00:43:28,838 --> 00:43:33,199
allows it and so you can pull those

1202
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:36,279
numbers wherever you are on the planet

1203
00:43:33,199 --> 00:43:38,558
now and say our little town has 40,000

1204
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:41,599
people I've done the math and we could

1205
00:43:38,559 --> 00:43:43,680
make this much or save this much make

1206
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:45,039
this much definitely y cost you a little

1207
00:43:43,679 --> 00:43:47,039
but I mean over a year's time you're

1208
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:50,039

00:43:53,838 --> 00:43:57,960
