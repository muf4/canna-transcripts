www.cdxzipstream.com ah then once that

10
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:53,129
settles down that is when that sour

11
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:55,198
aroma kicks in then when I took a DAB

12
00:00:53,128 --> 00:00:57,390
the first thing I noticed was that gassy

13
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:59,070
pungent flavor hit my tongue then on the

14
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:02,308
exhale it got earthy and then as it

15
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:03,899
settles down that gassy sourness skunk

16
00:01:02,308 --> 00:01:06,450
enos kind of settles on the tongue and

17
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:08,368
it gives me a really delicious kind of

18
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:11,310
aftertaste sort of a thick layer of

19
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:13,650
cottonmouth that I really enjoy I've

20
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:17,490
really been enjoying this trend in the

21
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:19,530
gassy garlicky savory sort of flavors in

22
00:01:17,489 --> 00:01:20,938
the concentrates or at least in my area

23
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:22,920
that seems to be a trend in the

24
00:01:20,938 --> 00:01:26,008
concentrates and I am really enjoying

25
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:29,670
that gassy garlicky sort of a trend the

26
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:32,430
garlic banger the hemdale acam the fat

27

65
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:35,250
there I'm glad that you appreciate the

66
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:36,569
audio quality because I do put a little

67
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:39,360
bit of work into that I've got a lot of

68
00:03:36,569 --> 00:03:40,650
toys making me sound like a pro I'm glad

69
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,870
that you enjoyed the content because

70
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:44,400
that is all my brain coming out goes

71
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:46,980
onto paper just a little bit very

72
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,090
minimal notes and then I just talk and

73
00:03:46,979 --> 00:03:50,250
put it out there so I'm glad you're

74
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:52,620
enjoying the content and my talking

75
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:55,019
style that's just me being me I try to

76
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:56,939
speak clearly and try to speak in a way

77
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:58,620
that I think most people who speak

78
00:03:56,939 --> 00:04:01,169
English would be able to understand and

79
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:02,640
comprehend what I'm saying so thank you

80
00:04:01,169 --> 00:04:04,439
for that those are all great compliments

81
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:06,000
we should keep moving it goes on to say

82
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:07,800
you should definitely be proud of the

83
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,530
work you're doing here thank you I

84
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:12,540
appreciate that the message continues it

85
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:14,640
says I tried a few other shows and found

86
00:04:12,539 --> 00:04:17,009
that yours has just the right amount of

87
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:17,789
[ __ ] bombs and given that I'm a huge

88
00:04:17,009 --> 00:04:19,500
potty mouth

89
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:23,069
the growth from your heart podcast is

90
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:24,810
the show for me that is a very

91
00:04:23,069 --> 00:04:26,339
interesting compliment and a very

92
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:27,329
interesting statement I'm glad that I'm

93
00:04:26,339 --> 00:04:29,728
dropping just the

94
00:04:27,329 --> 00:04:31,800
right amount of f-bombs for you I try

95
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:34,560
not to be a potty mouth but I do try to

96
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:37,319
be genuine and be myself and I say [ __ ]

97
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,879
sometimes so I do try to find that line

98
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:41,550
between being professional but also

99
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:44,009
being genuinely myself this is my show I

100
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:45,419
can say whatever I want to say and I

101
00:04:44,009 --> 00:04:47,310
feel like censoring myself too much

102
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:49,198
makes me sound a little bit fake and

103
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:50,639
then when you do meet me and we hang out

104
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,169
and I smell your weed I'm gonna go that

105
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,250
[ __ ] smells [ __ ] good and you're

106
00:04:52,168 --> 00:04:55,408
gonna look at me like wow I've never

107
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:57,000
heard you use profanity before and I'm

108
00:04:55,408 --> 00:04:59,209
blown away by it now you already know

109
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,168
that that's who I am it's not surprising

110
00:04:59,209 --> 00:05:03,209
people who have been listening to the

111
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:05,639
show for a long time may remember that

112
00:05:03,209 --> 00:05:07,709
in the beginning I tried to do a swear

113
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:09,150
jar just the old-fashioned every time

114
00:05:07,709 --> 00:05:11,250
you say the f-word you got to put a

115
00:05:09,149 --> 00:05:13,288
dollar in the swear jar and then I did

116
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:15,259
that and eventually I gave that money to

117
00:05:13,288 --> 00:05:17,848
a patient who needed some assistance

118
00:05:15,259 --> 00:05:20,069
once I gave that money to somebody I

119
00:05:17,848 --> 00:05:21,689
decided that was my final payment and I

120
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:23,039
was allowed to say whatever I wanted on

121
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:26,009
my show because there is no need to

122
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:27,718
censor me from being myself speaking of

123
00:05:26,009 --> 00:05:30,930
being myself I am stoned and way off

124
00:05:27,718 --> 00:05:32,550
track so let's get back on track here

125
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:35,430
with this email it goes like this

126
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:37,889
also I am the senior optical technician

127
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:41,098
for my dad's optical repair business

128
00:05:37,889 --> 00:05:43,560
basically I repair binoculars mostly

129
00:05:41,098 --> 00:05:45,750
antiques our shop is tucked into the

130
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,399
back of my dad's property we get the

131
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:49,079
majority of our business shipped to us

132
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:52,709
so we don't get many customers walking

133
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:54,990
in we listen to the G fyh podcast on the

134
00:05:52,709 --> 00:05:58,258
shop stereo for hours on end and we have

135
00:05:54,990 --> 00:06:00,838
gone as far as the low 200s in your

136
00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:02,370
episode feed on iTunes wow that's

137
00:06:00,838 --> 00:06:04,319
amazing you're listening to the old

138
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:07,019
stuff you may actually stumble across

139
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,069
that old swear jar episode but I think

140
00:06:07,019 --> 00:06:09,959
that's awesome that you guys are

141
00:06:08,069 --> 00:06:12,028

142

working all day I hope you're exposing

143
00:06:12,028 --> 00:06:16,288
some other employees to not only my

144
00:06:13,978 --> 00:06:18,449
f-bombs but also to the grow knowledge

145
00:06:16,288 --> 00:06:20,278
and maybe just opening up their minds to

146
00:06:18,449 --> 00:06:22,020
cannabis in general maybe there's

147
00:06:20,278 --> 00:06:23,218
somebody in the crew who wasn't a big

148
00:06:22,019 --> 00:06:25,288
fan of cannabis and now you've

149
00:06:23,218 --> 00:06:28,050

00:06:57,449 --> 00:07:02,159
making the new medical marijuana

166
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:04,379
movement happen let's keep moving with

167
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:07,410
this email because I am obviously stoned

168
00:07:04,379 --> 00:07:09,629
and rambley our friend Eric here says I

169
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:11,610
have been studying a lot I've been

170
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:14,040
reading books taking notes and

171
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:16,020
formulating my plan based on my grouse

172
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:18,629
style I like that that sounds very

173
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:21,719
enthusiastic it goes on to say your show

174
00:07:18,629 --> 00:07:23,219
plays a huge part in that I can imagine

175
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,470
that your grow is going to look a little

176
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:26,940
bit like my grow or at least the version

177
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:28,590
of my grow which you have painted in

178
00:07:26,939 --> 00:07:30,959
your head and I am really excited about

179
00:07:28,589 --> 00:07:32,909
that for you it keeps going and it says

180
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:34,859
basically I'm doing everything the way

181
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:36,720
you'd say to do it and referencing my

182
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:39,389
literature for finer details and

183
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,680
specific information I'm building a grow

184
00:07:39,389 --> 00:07:44,399
room in my garage

185
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:46,829
it measures 4.5 feet by 8 feet that has

186
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:50,159
an additional 2x3 closet that will house

187
00:07:46,829 --> 00:07:51,449
a mother clones and seedlings alright it

188
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,000
sounds like we have a decent sized

189
00:07:51,449 --> 00:07:56,370
flower room we've got a decent sized mom

190
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,899
and clone area it sounds like you're

191
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:58,649
really off to a good start you're

192
00:07:57,899 --> 00:08:00,329
reading books

193
00:07:58,649 --> 00:08:02,310
you're listening to podcasts and you

194
00:08:00,329 --> 00:08:04,349
were formulating a plan it looks like

195
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:06,300
you've got a nice floor plan made let's

196
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:08,430
keep moving it goes on to say I have a

197
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:10,590
lot of plans to optimize this grow space

198
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:13,530
but for now I need to finish the main

199
00:08:10,589 --> 00:08:16,049
construction to get growing eventually

200
00:08:13,529 --> 00:08:18,929
I'll build a nice big cabinet with an

201
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:20,639
automated system and all of that alright

202
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:21,990
I like that you're eager to get started

203
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,969
you just want to get things rolling so

204
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:25,860
you can get growing but my question is

205
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:28,169
why don't you just do it right the first

206
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:28,830
time and build that big grow space that

207
00:08:28,168 --> 00:08:30,389
you dream of

208
00:08:28,829 --> 00:08:32,038
since you're building it in the garage

209
00:08:30,389 --> 00:08:34,559
it's going to cost you time and money

210
00:08:32,038 --> 00:08:36,389
anyway why not just go big or go home on

211
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,489
that first build instead of having to

212
00:08:36,389 --> 00:08:40,649
redo it all over again I don't know your

213
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:42,180
situation but that would be my first

214
00:08:40,649 --> 00:08:43,889
question is why aren't we just doing it

215
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:45,779
the way we want to do it the first time

216
00:08:43,889 --> 00:08:47,069
I don't want to do [ __ ] twice we got to

217
00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:49,230
do the work we got to spend the money

218
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:51,240
let's just do it one time but I again I

219
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:52,740
don't know your situation maybe you

220
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,909
don't have that space available maybe

221
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,750
you don't have the budget maybe you

222
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:56,730
don't have the time

223
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:58,259
I don't know your situation but my first

224
00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:00,180
question is why are we gonna build it

225
00:08:58,259 --> 00:09:02,639
twice let's keep moving with the message

226
00:09:00,179 --> 00:09:04,919
it says so for now the actual gross

227
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:07,980
space inside the grow room for veg and

228
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:09,449
flour will be in a 2 by 4 grow tent I

229
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:12,240
really want to control the environment

230
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:14,580
as best as possible and I'm working with

231
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,960
limited floor space alright so for the

232
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:18,270
time being we are working with very

233
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:20,639
limited floor space so we are going to

234
00:09:18,269 --> 00:09:22,259
grow in a 2x4 grow tin it sounds like

235
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:24,240
and one of the main goals is to really

236
00:09:22,259 --> 00:09:26,759
control the environment as best as

237
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,250
possible that won't be too hard in such

238
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:31,319
a small environment if that tent is in a

239
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:34,200
larger room or a room which we can

240
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:36,090
ventilate so it goes on to say I will be

241
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:38,580
growing in a soilless mix using Fox

242
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:40,800
farms ocean forest and five gallon air

243
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:42,150
pots under an LED light that sounds like

244
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:45,029
a great setup that will work well for

245
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:47,759
you I plan on using only a few nutrients

246
00:09:45,029 --> 00:09:50,069
only what's needed the small amount of

247
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:52,379
nutrients that I do use will be what you

248
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:54,030
have recommended you can grow a very

249
00:09:52,379 --> 00:09:55,950
successful crop with very minimal

250
00:09:54,029 --> 00:09:57,419
nutrients if you pay attention to what

251
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:59,640
you're doing and I'm sure you'll be

252
00:09:57,419 --> 00:10:03,269
excited to hear that I am making

253
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:05,100
progress on the full mix episode I'm not

254
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:06,509
ready to record that yet I'm trying to

255
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:09,149
make sure that I get it right because

256
00:10:06,509 --> 00:10:11,669
you guys are going to rely on that mix I

257
00:10:09,149 --> 00:10:13,500
don't want to miss a single detail so

258
00:10:11,669 --> 00:10:15,719
I'm working that very heavily before I

259
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:17,789
press record but I'm working on a full

260
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:20,460
mix episode so you can know what I feed

261
00:10:17,789 --> 00:10:22,110
my plants every single week so look

262
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:24,480
forward to that but let's keep moving on

263
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:27,330
this email for now it says I will be

264
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:29,490
growing your arise I plan on growing the

265
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:32,129
[ __ ] out of a rise before moving on to

266
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:34,529
any other strains that is a very good

267
00:10:32,129 --> 00:10:36,389
idea pop a pack of arise seeds

268
00:10:34,529 --> 00:10:38,579
find a couple of keepers that you enjoy

269
00:10:36,389 --> 00:10:40,139
growing row those keepers a couple of

270
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:42,000
times until you narrow it down to your

271
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:44,580
favorite then build a solid relationship

272
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,769
with that one cultivar and really learn

273
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:48,330
how to dial in that one plant to reach

274
00:10:46,769 --> 00:10:51,059
its full potential that is a great

275
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:53,400
strategy it goes on to say I bought your

276
00:10:51,059 --> 00:10:55,469
seeds on this past 4/20 from the hell a

277
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:57,569
dank seed company so big shout out to my

278
00:10:55,470 --> 00:11:00,660
friends at the hell a dank seed company

279
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:02,220
you can find them at dank seed dot store

280
00:11:00,659 --> 00:11:04,679
make sure you check them out if you need

281
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:07,110
new seeds so here is where we get to the

282
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:08,429
question part of the podcast that says I

283
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:10,620
have listened to your episode

284
00:11:08,429 --> 00:11:12,989
honor rise and I took notes on it as

285
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:15,179
well and as I am writing the rough draft

286
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:18,210
for the veg phase of my plan these

287
00:11:15,179 --> 00:11:20,579
questions came up so our friend here is

288
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:22,769
growing my strain arise I've done a full

289
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:24,899
Episode on the arise strain they're

290
00:11:22,769 --> 00:11:26,789
listening they're taking notes they are

291
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:28,350
planning their grow they're planning so

292
00:11:26,789 --> 00:11:29,969
far that they are writing down notes for

293
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:32,070
the veg phase and they have come up with

294
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:35,040
some questions let's get to the first

295
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:39,270
question the first question about arise

296
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:41,819
is does arise like to be scrog and by

297
00:11:39,269 --> 00:11:43,679
ask raga mean a screen of green which is

298
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:45,720
when you put up a trellis net just above

299
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:47,849
your canopy and instead of letting that

300
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:49,730
plant grow straight up you use the net

301
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:52,470
to bend it over and make it grow

302
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:54,539
horizontally and you can maximize your

303
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:56,459
grow space instead of getting that plant

304
00:11:54,539 --> 00:11:58,259
straight up into the light you can bend

305
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:59,819
the plant over and it will grow sideways

306
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:01,708
for a little bit then it will start to

307
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:03,450
grow back up as it starts to grow

308
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:05,159
straight up again you can grab that

309
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:07,350
growth and tuck it under the next square

310
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:10,110
in your trellis then you can fill that

311
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:11,790
space and have the entire trellis filled

312
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:14,159
with branching when you flip it into

313
00:12:11,789 --> 00:12:16,528
flower you will fill your entire grow

314
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:19,350
area with buds so the question here is

315
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:22,919
does arise like to be scrubbed and the

316
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:25,709
answer is yes a rise takes very well to

317
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:28,289
scrog arise takes very well to popping

318
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:30,719
and twisting and topping and all sorts

319
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:33,149
of manipulation and training and I will

320
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,940
actually recommend that you do two maybe

321
00:12:33,149 --> 00:12:38,909
three layers of trellis netting for your

322
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:41,459
arise plants I generally use the first

323
00:12:38,909 --> 00:12:42,958
net as a spreader my plant is growing up

324
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:45,179
and it's getting tall right so I use

325
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:47,909
that first net to spread it out I want

326
00:12:45,179 --> 00:12:50,009
one branch through each square of my

327
00:12:47,909 --> 00:12:52,439
trellis net so I spread out the plant a

328
00:12:50,009 --> 00:12:54,059
little bit the second one is to work it

329
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,829
to control the height that's when I

330
00:12:54,059 --> 00:12:58,049
start bending the plant down so it

331
00:12:55,828 --> 00:13:00,000
doesn't get too tall that third one is

332
00:12:58,049 --> 00:13:01,799
to support those giant buds that are

333
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,889
gonna start developing around week four

334
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:06,750
five six and seven eight nine you may

335
00:13:04,889 --> 00:13:09,179
need to consider adding another trellis

336
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:11,458
depending on how rapidly your buds are

337
00:13:09,179 --> 00:13:13,439
growing this grow in question is

338
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:15,208
happening in a grow tent with an LED

339
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,550
light so you may not need that first

340
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:19,559
trellis net to work as a spreader as

341
00:13:17,549 --> 00:13:21,689
much you may be able to use that one as

342
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:22,018
your canopy control net you'll just be

343
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:23,790
able to

344
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:25,678
the plants right into that one you won't

345
00:13:23,789 --> 00:13:27,178
need that firstnet as a spreader because

346
00:13:25,678 --> 00:13:28,860
you don't have as many plants you don't

347
00:13:27,178 --> 00:13:30,568
have as much growth you don't have the

348
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:32,369
plants pressed together as closely as I

349
00:13:30,568 --> 00:13:33,719
do in a commercial environment in a

350
00:13:32,369 --> 00:13:36,178
commercial environment I'm using

351
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:38,459
double-ended Gavita lighting I'm using

352
00:13:36,178 --> 00:13:42,808
three gallon pots I'm getting an auto

353
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:44,849
watering system and I vegetable to even

354
00:13:42,808 --> 00:13:47,548
put in your small grow tent so I do

355
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:50,069
require at least two sometimes three

356
00:13:47,548 --> 00:13:52,769
sometimes four layers of trellis netting

357
00:13:50,068 --> 00:13:55,198
in a commercial environment so the short

358
00:13:52,769 --> 00:13:57,899
answer is yes a rise loves to be

359
00:13:55,198 --> 00:14:01,678
scrubbed the next question is what is

360
00:13:57,899 --> 00:14:04,889
her favorite light cycle eighteen on six

361
00:14:01,678 --> 00:14:07,198
off or sixteen on eight off that is a

362
00:14:04,889 --> 00:14:10,139
very good question I would suggest to

363
00:14:07,198 --> 00:14:12,448
the 18 on and six off but if you want to

364
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:15,989
get experimental I would almost suggest

365
00:14:12,448 --> 00:14:19,558
a twenty hours on and four hours off

366
00:14:15,989 --> 00:14:21,600
light cycle with arise of course you

367
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:24,028
have to pay attention to your plant to

368
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:27,028
dial this in but I have noticed that a

369
00:14:24,028 --> 00:14:29,850
rise likes a lot of light she has got

370
00:14:27,028 --> 00:14:32,068
some very tropical lineage to her she's

371
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:33,959
got a hawaiian sativa and an island

372
00:14:32,068 --> 00:14:36,360
sweet skunk in her so that means that

373
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:38,278
she has got some tropical lineage which

374
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:40,110
means she probably was getting a lot of

375
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:42,360
light and long day time periods

376
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:44,548
somewhere down the line in her gene pool

377
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:47,519
so I assume that several of her parents

378
00:14:44,548 --> 00:14:50,129
are used to getting a long daytime cycle

379
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:52,889
so a rise seems to want a lot of light

380
00:14:50,129 --> 00:14:55,170
now pay attention to your leaves plants

381
00:14:52,889 --> 00:14:57,209
have what is called the daily light

382
00:14:55,169 --> 00:14:58,919
integral once they've had enough light

383
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:59,818
they'll start shutting down they will

384
00:14:58,919 --> 00:15:01,708
take a nap

385
00:14:59,818 --> 00:15:04,229
you can see this at the end of the light

386
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:05,698
cycle because the leaves just begin to

387
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:07,649
droop it looks like there's something

388
00:15:05,698 --> 00:15:09,508
wrong with the plants there's absolutely

389
00:15:07,649 --> 00:15:11,369
nothing wrong they've got enough light

390
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:13,199
for the day and they just said that's it

391
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:14,939
sweet dreams and they just took a little

392
00:15:13,198 --> 00:15:16,588
nap they just tip their hat over their

393
00:15:14,938 --> 00:15:18,149
eyes put their feet up and leaned back

394
00:15:16,589 --> 00:15:20,579
and took a little sleeper for a minute

395
00:15:18,149 --> 00:15:23,668
so if you've got the opportunity to run

396
00:15:20,578 --> 00:15:25,708
20 hours on and four hours off I would

397
00:15:23,668 --> 00:15:27,928
do that and pay attention to the plants

398
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:32,008
then if you see some of the plants

399
00:15:27,928 --> 00:15:33,778
starting to droop around 16 17 18 hours

400
00:15:32,009 --> 00:15:35,459
in then you can start adjusting your

401
00:15:33,778 --> 00:15:39,058
timer accordingly but

402
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:41,729
go less than 18 on and six off because

403
00:15:39,058 --> 00:15:44,549
of those tropical genetics that I spoke

404
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:46,860
of earlier if you give a rise to little

405
00:15:44,549 --> 00:15:49,528
light and she gets rootbound she will

406
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:50,850
decide to flower on you if a rise

407
00:15:49,528 --> 00:15:53,009
becomes rootbound

408
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:55,800
it will try to flower so make sure you

409
00:15:53,009 --> 00:15:57,899
keep a rise in the appropriate sized pot

410
00:15:55,799 --> 00:16:00,299
and make sure to give her plenty of

411
00:15:57,899 --> 00:16:02,789
light so I would recommend starting with

412
00:16:00,299 --> 00:16:04,558
a twenty on and four off and paying

413
00:16:02,789 --> 00:16:06,149
attention to what happens to the plants

414
00:16:04,558 --> 00:16:08,879
if they start looking like they are

415
00:16:06,149 --> 00:16:11,249
drooping late into the veg cycle reduce

416
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:14,550
it by an hour reduce it by two hours but

417
00:16:11,249 --> 00:16:17,249
don't go less than 18 on and six hours

418
00:16:14,549 --> 00:16:19,198
off because your plants may try to

419
00:16:17,249 --> 00:16:21,629
flower on you now one of the big

420
00:16:19,198 --> 00:16:24,118
advantages of running your lights for 20

421
00:16:21,629 --> 00:16:25,829
on and 4 off is that when you do click

422
00:16:24,119 --> 00:16:28,259
that timer to 1212

423
00:16:25,828 --> 00:16:30,328
those are rise plants are really going

424
00:16:28,259 --> 00:16:32,039
to trigger into flower quite quickly

425
00:16:30,328 --> 00:16:34,649
because you have just made a drastic

426
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:37,379
change in the light cycle they will have

427
00:16:34,649 --> 00:16:40,169
no question that it is time to kick in

428
00:16:37,379 --> 00:16:42,688
to flower gear now if you were unable or

429
00:16:40,169 --> 00:16:45,958
uncomfortable with running a 20-hour on

430
00:16:42,688 --> 00:16:48,928
and four hour off light cycle 18 and 6

431
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:50,578
will work for your arise plants but I've

432
00:16:48,928 --> 00:16:52,860
been working with this strain for a very

433
00:16:50,578 --> 00:16:55,378
long time and I know that there are many

434
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:59,879
phenotypes that would prefer a longer

435
00:16:55,379 --> 00:17:02,249
day time veg cycle alright Eric I hope I

436
00:16:59,879 --> 00:17:04,409
helped you plan your grow and plan your

437
00:17:02,249 --> 00:17:05,730
veg cycle a little more closely if

438
00:17:04,409 --> 00:17:07,319
you've got any more questions please

439
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:09,088
send me an email

440
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:11,428
you obviously know the email address it

441
00:17:09,088 --> 00:17:13,139
is grow from your heart at hotmail.com I

442
00:17:11,429 --> 00:17:15,120
look forward to hearing from you he

443
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:17,069

450
00:17:31,349 --> 00:17:35,939
Hey Dude once again thank you for the

451
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,528
great email I'm going to keep moving

452
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:40,710
right through the pile of emails this

453
00:17:37,528 --> 00:17:42,480
next message goes just like this it says

454
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:44,220
hey Rasta Jeff I've been emailing

455
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,960
intermittently with you and I just

456
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:48,000
wanted to let you know I am starting to

457
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,779
work with the rise as one of my long

458
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,269
term

459
00:17:48,779 --> 00:17:52,769
project strains that's really great

460
00:17:51,269 --> 00:17:54,809
we've got two people talking about a

461
00:17:52,769 --> 00:17:56,759
rise in this episode let's keep moving

462
00:17:54,809 --> 00:17:59,369
with the message it says I have a diner

463
00:17:56,759 --> 00:18:01,140
II started at Gro Diaries calm under the

464
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:02,819
moniker of I'm not sure if they want me

465
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:05,340
to say their name so I'm going to skip

466
00:18:02,819 --> 00:18:07,230
that they go on to say I am only in the

467
00:18:05,339 --> 00:18:09,750
first week as of now but feel free to

468
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:12,180
check it out from time to time and if

469
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:14,789
you guys aren't aware Gro Diaries calm

470
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:17,100
is a great website and it's exactly what

471
00:18:14,789 --> 00:18:20,549
it sounds like it is a very detailed

472
00:18:17,099 --> 00:18:22,949
grow diary one of the things I really

473
00:18:20,549 --> 00:18:25,559
like about Gro Diaries calm is that I

474
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:28,170
can click on IRA genetics and it shows

475
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:30,029
me everybody who is growing or has grown

476
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:32,310
and I read genetics trained and made a

477
00:18:30,029 --> 00:18:34,019
diary on the website and so I can just

478
00:18:32,309 --> 00:18:35,309
scroll through and I can see our new

479
00:18:34,019 --> 00:18:37,619
friend here since he just gave me his

480
00:18:35,309 --> 00:18:39,869
name I can see that he pops up there he

481
00:18:37,619 --> 00:18:42,569
is I can click on his diary and see his

482
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:44,069
photos of arise and any details or

483
00:18:42,569 --> 00:18:45,869
information that he has typed in to

484
00:18:44,069 --> 00:18:48,509
share with us will be easily accessible

485
00:18:45,869 --> 00:18:50,129
for me to look at and then I can say oh

486
00:18:48,509 --> 00:18:51,720
he's feeding at bat and that's what it's

487
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:53,580
doing cool and I can share that kind of

488
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:55,710
info with other people who may want to

489
00:18:53,579 --> 00:18:57,569
grow that strain or you can go there

490
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:59,069
yourself and just take a look at it if

491
00:18:57,569 --> 00:19:02,069
you're that type of an internet cruiser

492
00:18:59,069 --> 00:19:04,379
our buddy Grimble the druid has a great

493
00:19:02,069 --> 00:19:06,089
grow diary is grown a lot of I read

494
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:08,550
genetics and some other stuff and he

495
00:19:06,089 --> 00:19:09,929
posts a lot of it to grow Diaries calm

496
00:19:08,549 --> 00:19:12,299
so go check him out

497
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:14,940
but I'm stoned and rambley so let's get

498
00:19:12,299 --> 00:19:16,710
back on track there is more it says I am

499
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:19,500
sure you have some better [ __ ] to do

500
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:23,100
than BS with me but any advice along the

501
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:24,779
way would not be refused alright my

502
00:19:23,099 --> 00:19:27,299
first piece of advice would be to check

503
00:19:24,779 --> 00:19:29,519
out episode number 329 of the growth

504
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:32,279
from your heart podcast I did an entire

505
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:33,930
episode about arise I'm going to assume

506
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:36,960
you have already heard that but if not

507
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:39,750
go check out number 329 I talked in

508
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:42,000
depth about the arise strain on episode

509
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:43,740
329 so check that out and then I'm sure

510
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,380
you just heard the two little add-ons I

511
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:48,809
did I talked about scrog arise and then

512
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:51,300
we just talked about timing for a rise

513
00:19:48,809 --> 00:19:53,789
in veg so if you've got any more

514
00:19:51,299 --> 00:19:55,799
questions please send me an email and I

515
00:19:53,789 --> 00:19:58,440
will do my best to get those on the show

516
00:19:55,799 --> 00:20:00,809
there is more to this message and it

517
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:02,670
says my goal in all of this is to be a

518
00:20:00,809 --> 00:20:04,230
solid home

519
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:06,660
with aspirations of doing something

520
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:09,509
bigger in the cannabis revolution we are

521
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:11,880
currently in I am deep in prohibition

522
00:20:09,509 --> 00:20:14,519
with no signs of my state coming out

523
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:17,010
soon but I love this hobby and this

524
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:18,569
plant if you're in prohibition land and

525
00:20:17,009 --> 00:20:20,579
you would like some help working towards

526
00:20:18,569 --> 00:20:23,549
legalization I would recommend finding

527
00:20:20,579 --> 00:20:26,039
your local normal chapter normal is the

528
00:20:23,549 --> 00:20:28,200
National Organization for the Reform of

529
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:30,029
Marijuana Laws and they will be able to

530
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:33,210
point you in the right direction to get

531
00:20:30,029 --> 00:20:36,119
you in cannabis activism so you said

532
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:37,860
that your main goal is to become a what

533
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:39,929
is the word you used a solid home grower

534
00:20:37,859 --> 00:20:41,429
and you've got aspirations of doing

535
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:43,620
something bigger with the cannabis

536
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:45,930
revolution so if you'd like to be part

537
00:20:43,619 --> 00:20:48,029
of that revolution now is the time to

538
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:50,190
join the battle I recommend you find

539
00:20:48,029 --> 00:20:52,740
your local normal chapter find your

540
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:54,690
local cannabis activism chapter whoever

541
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:57,269
it is wherever it is become involved

542
00:20:54,690 --> 00:21:00,299
with them however you can and learn how

543
00:20:57,269 --> 00:21:02,670
to make cannabis legal in your area so

544
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:05,009
you can be a bigger part of the cannabis

545
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:06,990
revolution they wrap up the message with

546
00:21:05,009 --> 00:21:09,599
maybe one day I will be consistent

547
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:10,950
enough to be a test grower for you and

548
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:12,689
then they sign it with their name and

549
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:14,910
I'm not sure if they want their name

550
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:16,740
said on the show so so I won't reveal

551
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:19,110
their identity but I will say thank you

552
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:21,480

557
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:32,130

558
00:21:30,059 --> 00:21:34,319

559
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:35,820

a longtime smoker but I am a toe

577
00:22:15,579 --> 00:22:20,589
newbee to growing I am nearing the end

578
00:22:18,369 --> 00:22:23,199
of my first grow and I've been fairly

579
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:24,849
pleased with my first attempt I credit

580
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,670
your knowledge for getting me through my

581
00:22:24,849 --> 00:22:29,949
first grow I grow for myself so my

582
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:33,700
growing goal is just to grow bomb-ass

583
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:36,400
weed potency is what I want so I do have

584
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:38,200
a question for you alright so we've got

585
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,720
a good foundation here we've got a new

586
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:42,789
friend named Kodiak from Oklahoma they

587
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:45,160
are a new grower they are nearing the

588
00:22:42,789 --> 00:22:46,990
end of their first grow they are fairly

589
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:48,130
pleased with the first grow they're

590
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:51,250
growing for themselves

591
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:53,530
and their main goal is potent bomb-ass

592
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:56,829
weed so they've got a question the

593
00:22:53,529 --> 00:22:58,779
question goes like this something I have

594
00:22:56,829 --> 00:23:01,569
found to be a little overwhelming as a

595
00:22:58,779 --> 00:23:05,019
new grower is definitely nutrients and

596
00:23:01,569 --> 00:23:08,349
additives alike this first go-around I

597
00:23:05,019 --> 00:23:10,690
used Fox Farm ocean forest soil and Fox

598
00:23:08,349 --> 00:23:14,289
farm bottled nutrients I have added

599
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:17,200
nothing else I use a 4 by 4 by 8 grow 10

600
00:23:14,289 --> 00:23:20,409
my question is what would you recommend

601
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:23,920
for a small-time grower to use nutrient

602
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:26,200
wise going forward also bro I totally

603
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:28,180
imagine you as a hella busy dude and I

604
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:31,150
won't sweat in the slightest if you

605
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:32,680
don't respond here it's all love I just

606
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:35,050
figured I couldn't hurt to ask for

607
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:37,180
advice from the best I'm sending good

608
00:23:35,049 --> 00:23:39,909
vibes to you they wrap it up with take

609
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:42,100
it easy and happy growing yeah I am a

610
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:44,650
busy dude but I've got a podcast and I

611
00:23:42,099 --> 00:23:46,839
love helping people with my podcast so

612
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:48,850
you are in luck let's talk a little bit

613
00:23:46,839 --> 00:23:51,549
about your question you started growing

614
00:23:48,849 --> 00:23:53,559
with the Fox farms ocean forest soil

615
00:23:51,549 --> 00:23:55,779
that is an acceptable soil not the most

616
00:23:53,559 --> 00:23:57,579
expensive not the cheapest not the best

617
00:23:55,779 --> 00:24:00,399
not the worst that is an acceptable

618
00:23:57,579 --> 00:24:03,490
quality soilless mix nothing wrong with

619
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:05,830
that then you use the Fox Farms bottled

620
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:07,870
nutrients probably the trio you didn't

621
00:24:05,829 --> 00:24:11,049
say exactly what you bought but you are

622
00:24:07,869 --> 00:24:14,759
asking what you can use nutrient wise to

623
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:17,559
go forward you have got a lot of options

624
00:24:14,759 --> 00:24:20,650
fortunately I am writing an episode all

625
00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:22,359
about my own personal feed mix that will

626
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:24,759
take a couple of more weeks before I get

627
00:24:22,359 --> 00:24:27,129
it out but it is coming in the meantime

628
00:24:24,759 --> 00:24:28,089
let's talk about a couple of things we

629
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:31,510
can add

630
00:24:28,089 --> 00:24:34,028
to this Fox farms mix I'm going to

631
00:24:31,509 --> 00:24:35,980
assume you are using the trio they've

632
00:24:34,028 --> 00:24:38,409
got a basic trio that they sell every

633
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:40,599
gross nor has it I think a lot of the

634
00:24:38,409 --> 00:24:42,700
hardware stores with a garden center

635
00:24:40,599 --> 00:24:45,668
actually offer Fox farms products at

636
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:47,710
this time so it is very available there

637
00:24:45,669 --> 00:24:50,020
is nothing wrong with the Fox Farms

638
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:53,259
lineup and I have seen very high quality

639
00:24:50,019 --> 00:24:56,069
product come from those nutrients but I

640
00:24:53,259 --> 00:24:58,720
do feel like it is a very entry-level

641
00:24:56,069 --> 00:25:01,509
product now since you're a new grower

642
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:03,730
that is perfect for you Fox farms

643
00:25:01,509 --> 00:25:06,220
nutrients are gentle enough that if you

644
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:08,740
do make a small mistake in your feeding

645
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:11,079
you will not destroy a crop with one

646
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:13,269
simple mistake they're also very

647
00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:15,639
affordable and it is very easy to mix

648
00:25:13,269 --> 00:25:18,250
when you've only got three maybe four or

649
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:19,720
five bottles to deal with I really feel

650
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:21,308
like there is nothing wrong with that

651
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:23,528
product I just feel that there are

652
00:25:21,308 --> 00:25:25,538
better options once you become a better

653
00:25:23,528 --> 00:25:28,750
grower and you understand what to watch

654
00:25:25,538 --> 00:25:30,669
for in the plants so for this situation

655
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:33,278
I am going to assume that you are using

656
00:25:30,669 --> 00:25:36,490
the Fox farms trio as your base and that

657
00:25:33,278 --> 00:25:37,569
is the grow big the tiger bloom and what

658
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:39,069
is the other one there it's the big

659
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:41,678
bloom I believe is what that's called

660
00:25:39,069 --> 00:25:43,629
and they also offer three powdered

661
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:46,419
nutrients Open Sesame

662
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:48,549
chi-ching and what's the name of that

663
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:50,740
third one beastie blooms I used Fox

664
00:25:48,548 --> 00:25:52,058
farms a really long time ago that might

665
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:54,159
have been the first or second product

666
00:25:52,058 --> 00:25:56,769
that I attempted to use and I just was

667
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:58,570
not satisfied with it so I moved on but

668
00:25:56,769 --> 00:26:00,819
let's just assume you were using the

669
00:25:58,569 --> 00:26:02,918
trio to start with perhaps you've got

670
00:26:00,819 --> 00:26:04,990
the three powders maybe you've got some

671
00:26:02,919 --> 00:26:07,000
bush doctor but let's talk about a

672
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:09,730
couple of things you can add to your

673
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:12,519
nutrient recipe to enhance your next

674
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:15,339
crop I always recommend some sort of

675
00:26:12,519 --> 00:26:17,200
microbes in your feeding regimen there

676
00:26:15,339 --> 00:26:20,408
are many options when it comes to

677
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:23,288
microbes microbe products can be very

678
00:26:20,409 --> 00:26:26,770
affordable and microbe products can also

679
00:26:23,288 --> 00:26:29,140
be astronomically expensive before you

680
00:26:26,769 --> 00:26:30,879
select any product for your grow do a

681
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:33,669
little bit of research on the product

682
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:35,980
itself find what it is made from find

683
00:26:33,669 --> 00:26:38,259
out who is making it and find out how

684
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:40,269
you want to spend your dollars then find

685
00:26:38,259 --> 00:26:41,869
a product that fits your price range and

686
00:26:40,269 --> 00:26:43,730
add that to your mix

687
00:26:41,869 --> 00:26:46,308
you do not have to use the most

688
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:47,870
expensive micro products you can find if

689
00:26:46,308 --> 00:26:48,619
you can't afford something really

690
00:26:47,869 --> 00:26:50,629
expensive

691
00:26:48,619 --> 00:26:53,479
use the microbes you can afford because

692
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:56,330
some microbes are way better than no

693
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:58,278
microbes adding beneficial microbes to

694
00:26:56,329 --> 00:27:01,069
your nutrient mix will be beneficial in

695
00:26:58,278 --> 00:27:04,278
many ways the first way is that it will

696
00:27:01,069 --> 00:27:06,649
simply increase root mass development

697
00:27:04,278 --> 00:27:09,048
you will grow stronger fatter thicker

698
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:11,840
healthier roots in less time

699
00:27:09,048 --> 00:27:14,538
fatter roots bigger fruits more healthy

700
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:16,579
roots more healthy plants adding

701
00:27:14,538 --> 00:27:19,460
microbes to our nutrient regimen will

702
00:27:16,579 --> 00:27:21,829
also help keep our plants pathogen free

703
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:24,558
if we have already developed colonies of

704
00:27:21,829 --> 00:27:26,750
beneficial fungus in our root zone there

705
00:27:24,558 --> 00:27:28,700
won't be room for pathogens if anything

706
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:30,679
else tries to come in those microbes go

707
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:32,840
nope this is our turf bro you're not

708
00:27:30,679 --> 00:27:36,559
allowed here so I would always recommend

709
00:27:32,839 --> 00:27:38,509
some sort of a microbe product now I

710
00:27:36,558 --> 00:27:40,819
keep saying that there are many microbe

711
00:27:38,509 --> 00:27:43,759
products available at many different

712
00:27:40,819 --> 00:27:46,548
price points let me recommend three of

713
00:27:43,759 --> 00:27:49,700
my favourite microbes to you I will

714
00:27:46,548 --> 00:27:52,668
recommend recharge I will recommend plus

715
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:54,980
life and I will recommend mammoth peat

716
00:27:52,669 --> 00:27:57,140
now those are three equal but very

717
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:59,360
different microbe products and they will

718
00:27:57,140 --> 00:28:01,700
all fall at very different price points

719
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:03,769
you can use any microbe product

720
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:05,630
individually or you can use most of them

721
00:28:03,769 --> 00:28:09,079
mixed together but I definitely

722
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:11,600
recommend you use at least one microbe

723
00:28:09,079 --> 00:28:14,028
product at least once a week in your

724
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:16,939
nutrient mix so the first thing I would

725
00:28:14,028 --> 00:28:18,740
add is a quality microbe product then

726
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:21,350
I've got a few other recommendations

727
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:23,720
that I would consider adding to that Fox

728
00:28:21,349 --> 00:28:26,119
farms lineup I would add a product

729
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:28,519
called shine to my lineup

730
00:28:26,119 --> 00:28:30,439
I think shine is a great product it is

731
00:28:28,519 --> 00:28:32,509
made by the folks that make veg bloom it

732
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:34,820
is part of the veg bloom line-up it is

733
00:28:32,509 --> 00:28:37,970
available from hydroponic Research you

734
00:28:34,819 --> 00:28:39,200
can find them at hydroponic - research

735
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:41,839
com

736
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,740
now let's talk about why I recommend

737
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:46,038
shine

738
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:49,009
I think shine adds to my bud density

739
00:28:46,038 --> 00:28:52,190
I think shine adds to my trichome

740
00:28:49,009 --> 00:28:55,369
density I think shine adds to my aroma

741
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:57,500
and flavor and I also think that if I

742
00:28:55,369 --> 00:29:00,558
use shine early in the flowering phase

743
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:04,099
it slows down part of my early stretch

744
00:29:00,558 --> 00:29:06,859
so I would add shine to my mix and you

745
00:29:04,099 --> 00:29:09,379
will see an increase in bud density and

746
00:29:06,859 --> 00:29:12,709
trichome density and possibly an

747
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:14,870
increase in aromas and flavors so now

748
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:16,759
we've got microbes making things work a

749
00:29:14,869 --> 00:29:18,829
little more quickly in the root zone now

750
00:29:16,759 --> 00:29:21,410
we've got some shine beefing up the buds

751
00:29:18,829 --> 00:29:24,109
give any more trichomes something else I

752
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:26,509
would add would be some fulvic acid and

753
00:29:24,109 --> 00:29:29,079
I would recommend Ruby from our friends

754
00:29:26,509 --> 00:29:32,259
at new millennium and I would use five

755
00:29:29,079 --> 00:29:35,539
milliliters of Ruby for every gallon of

756
00:29:32,259 --> 00:29:38,539
nutrient solution you mix up every time

757
00:29:35,539 --> 00:29:41,389
you feed those plants now why do I

758
00:29:38,539 --> 00:29:44,269
suggest fulvic acid we are feeding our

759
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:47,630
plants high-quality expensive nutrients

760
00:29:44,269 --> 00:29:50,119
fulvic acid essentially makes those

761
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:52,610
nutrients more available and more

762
00:29:50,119 --> 00:29:54,979
absorbable by our plants that is the

763
00:29:52,609 --> 00:29:56,959
short explanation it is sort of like

764
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:58,849
that gas additive that they sell for

765
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,079
your car they say yeah that gas works

766
00:29:58,849 --> 00:30:02,089
great in your car it makes the car go

767
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:03,470
vroom vroom add a little bit of this

768
00:30:02,089 --> 00:30:05,509
[ __ ] to the gas and the car will go

769
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:08,000
broom broom broom broom so that's

770
00:30:05,509 --> 00:30:09,920
basically what fulvic acid does it gives

771
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,869
you just a few more rpms a couple more

772
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:13,970
horsepower a little bit more turbo

773
00:30:11,869 --> 00:30:15,529
charge it makes all of those expensive

774
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:18,710
nutrients we are feeding to the plant

775
00:30:15,529 --> 00:30:20,960
more absorbable more available to our

776
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:24,259
plane so I would suggest or recommend

777
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:27,289
adding some fulvic acid to your feeding

778
00:30:24,259 --> 00:30:30,619
regimen my favorite fulvic acid product

779
00:30:27,289 --> 00:30:34,069
is again Ruby from new millennium and I

780
00:30:30,619 --> 00:30:36,349
use Ruby at five milliliters per gallon

781
00:30:34,069 --> 00:30:39,109
of everything I mix up if i mix

782
00:30:36,349 --> 00:30:42,589
nutrients i put five milliliters of Ruby

783
00:30:39,109 --> 00:30:44,419
in every gallon every time I feed now at

784
00:30:42,589 --> 00:30:46,970
this point with this many new additives

785
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:49,039
we have kind of turbocharged our plants

786
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:50,870
we need to pay attention to

787
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:53,569
cal-mag are you getting a cal mag

788
00:30:50,869 --> 00:30:56,089
deficiency if you don't have a cal mag

789
00:30:53,569 --> 00:30:59,029
product this may be the time to consider

790
00:30:56,089 --> 00:31:01,129
adding cal mag to your lineup do you

791
00:30:59,029 --> 00:31:03,859
know what a cal mag deficiency looks

792
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:07,370
like because we are currently not adding

793
00:31:03,859 --> 00:31:08,719
any calcium or magnesium supplements to

794
00:31:07,369 --> 00:31:11,089
these plants with this

795
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:13,548
a nutrient feed so with these extra

796
00:31:11,089 --> 00:31:16,399
additives we just put in the mix we may

797
00:31:13,548 --> 00:31:18,109
need to watch for a cal-mag deficiency

798
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:20,419
so before we start boosting up our

799
00:31:18,109 --> 00:31:22,339
nutrients I recommend you find the chart

800
00:31:20,419 --> 00:31:25,299
on the internet that shows the cannabis

801
00:31:22,339 --> 00:31:28,250
leaf and all of the nutrient symptoms of

802
00:31:25,298 --> 00:31:29,990
deficiencies and toxicities it will show

803
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:33,859
you what cannabis li and it will say

804
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:36,230
nitrogen deficiency or toxicity calcium

805
00:31:33,859 --> 00:31:38,418
toxicity or deficiency and it will show

806
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:40,730
you what they look like get a good idea

807
00:31:38,419 --> 00:31:42,559
of what the cal-mag deficiency looks

808
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:44,750
like get a good idea of what the

809
00:31:42,558 --> 00:31:46,759
nitrogen deficiency looks like get a

810
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:49,279
good idea of what phosphorus and

811
00:31:46,759 --> 00:31:51,079
potassium deficiencies look like that

812
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:52,460
way when those things come up we know

813
00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:55,099
how to adjust but right now we're

814
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:57,440
focusing on cal-mag learn what a cal-mag

815
00:31:55,099 --> 00:31:59,869
deficiency looks like and think about if

816
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:02,150
it's time to start adding cal-mag to

817
00:31:59,869 --> 00:32:04,609
your nutrient regimen so we have added

818
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:06,590
some microbes we've added some shine we

819
00:32:04,609 --> 00:32:08,149
put some fulvic acid in there we may

820
00:32:06,589 --> 00:32:09,319
need some cal-mag now that we're going

821
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:12,230
so hard with these plants were

822
00:32:09,319 --> 00:32:13,069
turbocharging them what can we possibly

823
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:15,409
do next

824
00:32:13,069 --> 00:32:18,168
at this point I would recommend a

825
00:32:15,409 --> 00:32:21,260
product called winter frost from new

826
00:32:18,169 --> 00:32:23,509
millennium winter frost is used right at

827
00:32:21,259 --> 00:32:26,058
the end of the flowering phase just

828
00:32:23,509 --> 00:32:29,119
before a flush I feel like if you use

829
00:32:26,058 --> 00:32:32,450
winter frost and shine together you will

830
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:34,969
see tremendous results now you have to

831
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:36,830
be careful not to burn your plants when

832
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:39,769
you are adding this many additives to

833
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:42,109
your recipe I recommend that you start

834
00:32:39,769 --> 00:32:44,509
slowly the first time you introduce

835
00:32:42,109 --> 00:32:47,029
winter frost to your feed mix maybe go

836
00:32:44,509 --> 00:32:48,619
half strength and see what it does does

837
00:32:47,029 --> 00:32:50,808
it burn the plants did you notice

838
00:32:48,619 --> 00:32:53,029
anything if it didn't have any adverse

839
00:32:50,808 --> 00:32:56,450
effects to the plants increase the

840
00:32:53,029 --> 00:32:58,308
dosage on the next feed make sure you

841
00:32:56,450 --> 00:33:00,860
keep notes of what you are feeding your

842
00:32:58,308 --> 00:33:03,558
plants so that you know how much you fed

843
00:33:00,859 --> 00:33:05,959
it and how the plant responded so start

844
00:33:03,558 --> 00:33:08,210
lightly maybe a quarter maybe 50% of the

845
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:10,490
recommended dosage feed it that see how

846
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:12,259
the plant responds next time feed it

847
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:14,690
more if you want to feed it less if you

848
00:33:12,259 --> 00:33:16,879
need to but don't go full strength right

849
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:19,730
away when you are adding this many

850
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,899
additives to your nutrient solution now

851
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:22,279
I've still got a couple of things I'd

852
00:33:20,898 --> 00:33:24,469
like to recommend so let

853
00:33:22,279 --> 00:33:27,730
keep moving at this point I may suggest

854
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:30,710
adding some enzymes to your nutrient mix

855
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:32,839
enzymes work with the microbes enzymes

856
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:34,700
work with the folding acid and they help

857
00:33:32,839 --> 00:33:38,269
to make all of the nutrients more

858
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:40,069
available to the plants enzymes will

859
00:33:38,269 --> 00:33:42,799
also work with the microbes and the

860
00:33:40,069 --> 00:33:44,990
folic acid to keep the plants pathogen

861
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:48,309
free so I would recommend adding an

862
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:50,960
enzymatic product to your nutrient mix

863
00:33:48,309 --> 00:33:53,299
now the next product is just something

864
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:55,670
that I personally add to my personal

865
00:33:53,299 --> 00:33:58,700
grows because I believe it adds aroma

866
00:33:55,670 --> 00:34:01,940
and flavor I really think this product

867
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:04,130
brings out the skunky funky dirty cushy

868
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:06,830
aromas and the product I am talking

869
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:09,050
about is called liquid karma liquid

870
00:34:06,829 --> 00:34:11,119
karma is from botanic air it is very

871
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:14,269
affordable it is more of a supplement

872
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:17,000
but it is a product that I add for aroma

873
00:34:14,269 --> 00:34:19,699
and flavor and possibly a little bit of

874
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,590
bud density I don't know if I'm crazy I

875
00:34:19,699 --> 00:34:24,168
don't know if I'm making it up it could

876
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:27,139
possibly be a placebo effect but I do

877
00:34:24,168 --> 00:34:30,049
feel then when I use liquid karma that

878
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:32,329
my buds smell just a little bit stickier

879
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:34,550
than when I don't use it so that is the

880
00:34:32,329 --> 00:34:37,610
last specific product I'm going to

881
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:40,129
recommend you may also want to add a

882
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:42,800
bloom booster to your regimen but I

883
00:34:40,128 --> 00:34:44,539
don't have a specific bloom booster

884
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,639
recommendation there are countless

885
00:34:44,539 --> 00:34:48,918
options available for bloom boosters

886
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:51,110
again stay tuned to the show because in

887
00:34:48,918 --> 00:34:53,869
the very near future I am going to do a

888
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:57,470
very detailed episode possibly two

889
00:34:53,869 --> 00:35:01,279
episodes on my very specific nutrient

890
00:34:57,469 --> 00:35:03,139
recipe and how I mix it so let's recap i

891
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:05,090
think i said i would add microbes

892
00:35:03,139 --> 00:35:07,609
because microbes will make the roots

893
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:09,500
grow faster and keep pathogens away then

894
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:12,170
i would add some shine because shine is

895
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:14,780
going to give us more trichomes and more

896
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:17,360
bud density and who doesn't like denser

897
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:19,460
trichome covered buds then i would add

898
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:22,280
some fulvic acid to make all of those

899
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:24,619
nutrients better available to the plants

900
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:27,769
at this point we may need some cal-mag

901
00:35:24,619 --> 00:35:30,170
then i got a little bit random and i

902
00:35:27,769 --> 00:35:33,519
went with some winter frost some liquid

903
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:36,139
karma some enzymes and possibly a bloom

904
00:35:33,519 --> 00:35:38,030
booster so I hope I have opened

905
00:35:36,139 --> 00:35:39,739
your mind giving you a few options of

906
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:41,960
things you can add to your Fox Farms

907
00:35:39,739 --> 00:35:43,939
lineup again any of those products will

908
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:45,980
be beneficial a couple of them in

909
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:48,200
conjunction with each other will really

910
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:50,539
do a great job I would always recommend

911
00:35:48,199 --> 00:35:52,730
some fulvic acid because you're already

912
00:35:50,539 --> 00:35:55,550
paying for the nutrients why not add

913
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:58,219
that fulvic acid to actually make all of

914
00:35:55,550 --> 00:36:00,380
the nutrients available to the plants

915
00:35:58,219 --> 00:36:01,909
then once we've got the basic nutrition

916
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:04,550
covered that's when we want to start

917
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:06,920
adding things to give us beefier bulkier

918
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:09,080
plants with more stank and more resin

919
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:11,420
that's when we move in to the products

920
00:36:09,079 --> 00:36:14,420
like shine the winter frost and then

921
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:16,909
eventually we end with bloom boosters so

922
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:18,829
I hope I have inspired you I hope I did

923
00:36:16,909 --> 00:36:20,599
not overwhelm you and if you want to

924
00:36:18,829 --> 00:36:22,909
learn more about nutrients and you want

925
00:36:20,599 --> 00:36:24,980
to learn exactly what I am mixing stay

926
00:36:22,909 --> 00:36:27,589
tuned because I like to keep teasing it

927
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:31,490
but in a few episodes I'm going to put

928
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:35,030
out a very detailed on exactly what I

929
00:36:31,489 --> 00:36:36,799
feed and how I feed my plants I want to

930
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:38,960
thank my new friend Kodiak in Oklahoma

931
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:41,150
for the great email if anybody else out

932
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:43,070
there has a cannabis cultivation or a

933
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:44,930
cannabis culture question I would love

great went to the picture to take that
