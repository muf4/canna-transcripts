helping out been doing some growing he's

135
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,960

136
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,720
that's the word passionate about the

137
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:44,879
cannabis plant about the growing also

138
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,320

00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:33,839
really cool event let's just jump right

166
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:35,839
into talking about it bro it was at a

167
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:37,439
super cool location i don't know what

168
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:39,519
that place was called i don't know what

169
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:41,360
that place is today all i know is that

170
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:44,079
on saturday they cleared everything out

171
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,639
of there and we put up probably 25 cool

172
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:49,279
booths a dj and a drum set and threw a

173
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:52,000
secret stash seed exchange in there

174
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:53,519
beautiful venue in the rhino district of

175
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,319
denver and

176
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:58,399
secret stash was uh definitely an

177
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:01,360
experience um

178
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:04,879
first not knowing exactly where it was

179
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,400
until the day of was kind of

180
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:07,680
unique for me

181
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:09,198
i didn't i didn't know either they

182
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,800
didn't tell yeah you would of course

183
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,720
known but they didn't tell anybody where

184
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,360
the event was located until the day of

185
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,440
the event they would give you hints uh

186
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,199
first it was it's in denver and then

187
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:20,879
it's going to be near downtown and then

188
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,639
it's at the rhino district and then the

189
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:24,800
day of the event they actually told us

190
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:27,439
the exact address the vendors got the

191
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,960
address i think around 8 30 or 9 is when

192
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:30,560
i got the text i was walking the dogs

193
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:31,359
and pulled up the phone and had it after

194
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,720
that

195
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,639
so there was a message saying hey

196
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,319
vendors here it is then it said do not

197
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,319
share this address yet we're not giving

198
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,919
it to the other people until later

199
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,759
most people didn't get it the attendees

200
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:43,279
didn't get it until 11 and it opened at

201
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,800
noon so

202
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:45,839
they made it really easy to set up

203
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,000
because a lot of times they'll be

204
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:49,519

205

up from pueblo but i agree dude not

220
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:16,318
knowing where it is is a little

221
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:18,719
nerve-wracking how do you know where to

222
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,160
get a hotel how do you know how to plan

223
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,759
you just got to fly by the seat of your

224
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,039
pants that's how being a weed grower and

225
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,160
a seed seller has always been in my

226
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:27,759
opinion

227
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,960

it was the people that were there

255
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,240
looking for specific genetics they would

256
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:28,639

274
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:02,639
he had a strategy already perfect

275
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:05,439
yeah he knew exactly where he wanted to

276
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:06,879
shop who he wanted to see i want to uh i

277
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,000
want to go backwards a little bit seed

278
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:12,159
vendors inside food trucks and art and

279
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,399
culture outside that was super cool

280
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:16,879
that's right we had artists right in

281
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:19,120
front of us like doing their oh yeah

282
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:20,639
artists inside their craft yeah that was

283
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,399
that was really fun i actually got to

284
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:24,559
like talk with a couple of the artists

285
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:27,759
and tell them hey man it's really fun to

286
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:29,838
watch you and your your art yeah so the

287
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:31,039
canvas would go from blank to artwork

288
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,720
and they would take down the art and put

289
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:34,000
up another one and then i was like what

290
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,360
are they drawing who is that and then

291
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,639
suddenly the guy that they had painted

292
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,839
walked by and they had him hold up the

293
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:40,240
painting i was like that's pretty cool

294
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:42,880
man that's that guy for sure so yeah

295
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:45,360
just a just a wonderful event uh groovy

296
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:47,039
gravy excellent job yeah yeah really

297
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,039
great good job we'll be there next year

298
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:50,559
so everybody absolutely plan ahead about

299
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:52,559
this time next year that'll be the third

300
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:54,799
one next year i'll be bigger better

301
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:56,799
better i will prepare better we had the

302
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:58,079
menu on a qr code because i didn't want

303
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:00,240
to waste paper

304
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,600
i never know how many menus to print out

305
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,519
and i don't like throwing them away

306
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,959
after the event so i made a qr code you

307
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,440
scan it with your phone i feel like that

308
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:09,518
may have costed us a few sales but

309
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,079
that's a learning experience you know in

310
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:15,200
denver it seems like everything is qr

311
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:16,958
code so it's tough for us to be

312
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,440
down on ourselves for something that

313
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:21,119
seems like a very

314
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,560
like trendy

315
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,320
should have been people should have been

316
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:26,639
ready for it and the people that weren't

317
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,920
it seemed like well i don't know

318
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:29,439
yeah we probably could add a couple of

319
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:31,039
menus they were definitely from

320
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,120
somewhere smaller is the polite way to

321
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:35,360
say it and welcome welcome to colorado

322
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,959
welcome to denver man such a good time

323
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:40,079
though such positive

324
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:41,679
energy everybody was in such a good mood

325
00:10:40,078 --> 00:10:43,120
a lot of the times at these events you

326
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:44,239
get hungry or something like halfway

327
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,679
through the day you get the munchies

346
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:19,278
on the uh the list of the people that we

347
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:21,039
should give a shout out to because we

348
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:22,799
saw a bunch of cool people i tried to

349
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:25,039
make a list and a note as the day went

350
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:27,039
on but there were so many people and i

351
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:29,838
was working with customers and friends

352
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:33,519
and uh i was high there's a lot going on

353
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:36,560
also the the event was a very like timed

354
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:38,959
event for the customers yes because they

355
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:43,119
they had like an hour allotment to come

356
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:45,199
in and shop through every vendor so

357
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,120
is that good is that bad i don't know

358
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,200
because it kept people moving we had a

359
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,440
lot of different customers but you know

360
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:54,160
there was like five different

361
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:56,800
it was like five events almost right

362
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:58,719
like okay everybody get out next right

363
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,919
it was polite yeah so they bought ticket

364
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,079
they knew when they bought tickets they

365
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:04,479
would get a one-hour time slot to shop

366
00:12:02,078 --> 00:12:06,799
and this was done to uh to uh follow

367
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,240
covid protocol this was before this was

368
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:09,519
booked before the coveted restrictions

369
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,120
were released so

370
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:13,120
this was just to be safe and comply with

371
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,639
all of denver's weird restrictions uh so

372
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,799
i think next year we may be able to open

373
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,879
it up and not do the the phases but what

374
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:20,240
they do to and also to limit capacity of

375
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:21,360
the building and to not overwhelm the

376
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,120
breeders and to follow covert

377
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,879
restrictions like said they give you

378
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,039
they open the door at noon

379
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:28,399
and you get to run through until 12 and

380
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:30,799
then they are at one and they kick you

381
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:32,159
out at one and then from one to 115 it

382
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:34,639
was really nice because we got to

383
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:36,240

385
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,159

cliff ravenscraft taught me that you

628
00:20:09,038 --> 00:20:13,679
become the sum of the five people which

629
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:16,880
you surround yourself with the most

630
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:18,840
uh you mike my girlfriend and probably

631
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,320
uh accidentally my mom is one of those

632
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:21,519
people because i like to hang out with

633
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:22,798
mama she's you know she ain't gonna be

634
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:24,558
there forever trying to lost as much

635
00:20:22,798 --> 00:20:26,480
time as i can with her now your mom's a

636
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:27,678
great person she's my favorite person i

637
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,519
tell my girlfriend she's my favorite

638
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,038
person but mama you you win yeah and

639
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:32,960
babe when you hear this that's how it

640
00:20:31,038 --> 00:20:34,720
goes um

641
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,840
you mike my mom my girl and there's one

642
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,960
other person i'm not sure probably

643
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:38,639
rotates you know what i mean i probably

644
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,880
rotate that fifth person out it's the

645
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,960
discord crew collectively is who that

646
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,159
fifth person would be uh but bro you're

647
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,440
one of the five people i don't surround

648
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,200
myself with [ __ ] because then you

649
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,798
become a [ __ ] uh if you surround

650
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,319
yourself with five ceos five

651
00:20:48,798 --> 00:20:52,240

love growing weed and i just don't know

851
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:04,400
the nuances so when people are asking

852
00:27:02,319 --> 00:27:05,439
questions it's like well

853
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,600

855
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:11,119
yeah yeah that's that's the answer most

856
00:27:09,278 --> 00:27:12,720
of the time but and half the time they

857
00:27:11,119 --> 00:27:13,439
just want to talk to me anyway because i

858
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,120
know

859
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,798
like i've been growing these plants for

860
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:18,639
longer than i should admit so i've got

861
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:20,240
relationships with the golden goat plan

862
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,960

867
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:31,359
react if you feed it straight uria i

868
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:32,240
might know how it's going to react like

869
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:33,678
i know what they're going to do because

870
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,079
i messed with them so much and i've got

871
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:37,200
so much data from my my crowd that i

872
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:38,319
know what they're going to do so i can

873
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,919
tell you about them so much it's like

874
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:41,678
talking about my own kids you do you're

875
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:43,600

interrupt no do it bro you do get a lot

877
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:50,240
of data from your crowd yes like that is

878
00:27:47,278 --> 00:27:53,038
such an important part of your community

879
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:56,720
that maybe they don't understand how

880
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:58,398
how much that helps in in every way oh

881
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,480
yeah all the feedback they send if they

882
00:27:58,398 --> 00:28:02,719
say this one smelled like blueberries or

883
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:05,200
this one smelled like feet i don't take

884
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,480
just one person's word for it but a lot

885
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,038
of people will message me and then i

886
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,720
start compiling a database like uh the

887
00:28:09,038 --> 00:28:14,158
convergence will say a lot of people say

888
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:15,839
it smells like uh spicy fabric softener

889
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:17,440
sheets or spicy dryer sheets or

890
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:19,359
something like that and when i hear the

891
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,798
word spicy multiple times that's

892
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:23,119
definitely an accurate description if

893
00:28:20,798 --> 00:28:24,639
one guy says rotten mangoes i won't

894
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:26,879
include that but if two or three people

895
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,240
say smell like rotten mangoes i will say

896
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,520
there's a phenotype that could smell

897
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:32,000
like rotten mangoes you just got to

898
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:33,918
include the data but data is also in the

899
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,079
weed community you got to like

900
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:37,520
exclude and be really filtery with data

901
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:39,119
that's why i love and hate the internet

902
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:40,558
forums because people can type whatever

903
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:42,239
they want

904
00:28:40,558 --> 00:28:44,079

00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:55,839
about making autoflower seeds and i said

911
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:57,359
that autoflowers are not for me

912
00:28:55,839 --> 00:28:59,119

915
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,640

916
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,798
how to breed autos i do know a guy that

917

937
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:54,798
night army some irie owls some night owl

938
00:29:52,798 --> 00:29:56,720
irie iriegenetics collabs coming up in

939
00:29:54,798 --> 00:29:59,278
the future stay tuned it's going to take

940
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:01,120
a long time you guys um

941
00:29:59,278 --> 00:30:02,960
do not rush this project honestly this

942
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:05,199
could take at least a year and a half to

943
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:07,600
get we got to get to at least i think in

944
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:10,319
my understanding we got to get to the f5

945
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:12,079
or f6 before we've got reliable autos so

946
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:14,879
that could take a year and a half two

947
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:16,798
years to get there but you auto nerds it

948
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:19,200
is coming stay

949
00:30:16,798 --> 00:30:20,639
tuned something i really wanted to talk

950
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,558
about at the event

951
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:24,399
um i saw a lot of breeders with

952
00:30:22,558 --> 00:30:26,798
different approaches to customer service

953
00:30:24,398 --> 00:30:28,798
that's the polite way to say it

954
00:30:26,798 --> 00:30:30,079
don't let seed sellers intimidate you

955
00:30:28,798 --> 00:30:31,278
and try to take your money without

956
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:33,278
giving you the product that you are

957
00:30:31,278 --> 00:30:36,079
satisfied with and the information you

958
00:30:33,278 --> 00:30:38,558
need to successfully grow that product

959
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:41,839
um i love talking about my seeds because

960
00:30:38,558 --> 00:30:44,000
i made them i know the details i know

961
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:46,158
the the minutia is that the word i think

962
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,599
the nuances of each plant i know the

963
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:49,200
grandparents i know the parents of the

964
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:50,879
seeds i'm selling you yeah i know the

965
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,480
parents of those plants i'm selling you

966
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,278
i've probably researched their great

967
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,599
grandparents and their

968
00:30:53,278 --> 00:30:56,880
great-grandparents on both sides i know

969
00:30:55,599 --> 00:30:59,038
what i'm giving you i know what i'm

970
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:01,440
offering i'm really proud of what i've

971
00:30:59,038 --> 00:31:02,960
made i'm not shy about it because it's

972
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,798
like talking about my kids i get to talk

973
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,159
about little jimmy's in soccer practice

974
00:31:04,798 --> 00:31:07,759
and [ __ ] i don't have a jimmy i'm

975
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:09,039
just making [ __ ] up but i can talk about

976
00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:10,480
i do have a jimmy but not a kid named

977
00:31:09,038 --> 00:31:13,599
jimmy

978
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,599
i might not even edit that

979
00:31:14,319 --> 00:31:19,278
i like it we're live to drive

980
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:21,919
but um i really love talking about so if

981
00:31:19,278 --> 00:31:23,440
a seed seller isn't excited to talk to

982
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:24,399
you about his stuff to tell you details

983
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,159
about it

984
00:31:24,398 --> 00:31:27,599
that makes me skeptical that makes me

985
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:28,960
and i'm not calling anybody out i'm not

986
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:30,879
saying any names i'm saying when you go

987
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,000
to the booth there should be info there

988
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,399
should be details there should be

989
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,919
conversation there should be a smile uh

990
00:31:34,398 --> 00:31:38,398
if a dude's got a bad look on his face

991
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:40,000
that bad look maybe in his seeds uh if

992
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:41,278
he's got bad energy that may be in the

993
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,200
seeds also keep in mind we've been

994
00:31:41,278 --> 00:31:44,798
standing there since 10 or 11 today and

995
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,240
talked to a lot of people so give us a

996
00:31:44,798 --> 00:31:48,079
grain of salt and also a bottle of water

997
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:51,440
if you've got one maybe a dab if you can

998
00:31:48,079 --> 00:31:52,879
but um the sellers should have info you

999
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,240
should get all the details you need they

1000
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,000
shouldn't [ __ ] you you should feel

1001
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,200
comfortable shouldn't feel rushed

1002
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,119
shouldn't feel like you're bothering

1003
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:01,120
anybody by asking questions

1004

bought those seeds that he wanted i

1046
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,359

1047
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:16,559
of seeds and given him

1048
