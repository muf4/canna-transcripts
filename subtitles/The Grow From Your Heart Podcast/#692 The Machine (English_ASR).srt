marco escondolas ryrie rocco the

66
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:37,039
question goes hey ross to jeff i'm sure

67
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:39,759
you get a lot of requests for podcasts

68
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:41,759
dedicated to your seed varieties but i

69
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:44,079
thought i would ask a few specific

70
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:46,000
questions to help spur your thoughts

71
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,400
this was a perfectly timed email because

72
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,039
i am going to release the machine and

73
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,560
the saka souffle both on black friday

74
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:55,439
those will be part of the black friday

75
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,519
sale um he does ask about soccer souffle

76
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:59,039
and the machine this episode is going to

77
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,439
be focused on the machine so i'm going

78
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:04,239
to skip right to that question it says

79
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:05,919
the machine uh what is kem de la chem

80
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,920
and which breeder that's a very good

81
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:10,878
question there is more to this but i

82
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:12,799
kind of wanted to uh focus on those two

83
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:14,399
strains for the next two episodes this

84
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,159
episode will be the machine the next

85
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,360
episode obviously will be the soccer

86
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:19,039
souffle

87
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,280
let's talk a little bit about those so i

88
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:24,079
do have a bunch of notes here about the

89
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,878
machine let me cut the rambling and jump

90
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:29,120
right into it the machine if you've been

91
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:31,439
following my social media you have been

92
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,280
seeing the or my discord even you've

93
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:35,598
been seeing a lot of posts about the

94
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,840
machine the machine has been um in

95
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:40,238
testing and it has been showing great

96
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,000
amazing impressive results a lot of the

97
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,480
people testing it have uh harvested

98
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,239
their test crops they're now smoking it

99
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:48,000
i've actually tasted and smoked some

100
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,400
concentrates made from a test run of the

101
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,479
machine we have all decided that it is

102
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,080
impressive smoke so

103
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:56,479
i said i wasn't going to ramble but i'm

104
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:59,120
doing that so let's jump into my report

105
00:03:56,479 --> 00:04:01,518
about a strain called the machine the

106
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,920
parents of the machine obviously marco

107
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:06,319
escondolas asked if uh let me see there

108
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:08,719
was a specific question uh which kem de

109
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:11,839
la chem is it the parents of the machine

110
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:13,919
are chem daily chem cross to arise uh to

111
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,639
the best of my knowledge the chem de la

112
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:18,879
chem came from top dog genetics and that

113
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:21,519
is where i believe this one came from uh

114
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:23,360
this was given to me as a clone by a

115
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,120
friend who sprouted the seed big shout

116
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,720
out to my friend you know who you are

117
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,079
but this clone really stood out in my

118
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,400
garden we'll talk about that more in a

119
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:34,560
little bit but this is the kem de la kim

120
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:36,560
kim daily kim was ah chem d to i-95 or

121
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,560
it is chemdai 95 i don't guess it

122
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,600
changed that is the cam de la chem chem

123
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,918
d to i-95 i love it because

124
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,560
it just stinks it's got such good stink

125
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:48,478
to it that chem daily kim brings a that

126
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,199
old-school skunky with the new school

127
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:53,680
diesel funk with that really crazy chem

128
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:56,160
flavor and the buzz to it is beautiful

129
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,600
and it grows like a savage and it's very

130
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,280
photogenic that's something else i

131
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,520
should talk about which did transfer

132
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:03,839
into the machine all right so that's the

133
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:05,279
the chem daily chem which was the female

134
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:07,439
plant used in this cross that is the

135
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:09,839
mother plant that got pollinated on the

136
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:12,560
male side we do have the arise also

137
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:13,918
known as king solomon my king solomon is

138
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,399
a um

139
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:17,599
a beautiful specimen of a male i was

140
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:19,918
going to say a stud is the word that

141
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,320
left my brain there a stud of a male

142
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:24,240
plant of a an arise cut it's just an

143
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:25,839
arise male that i have named king

144
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,840
solomon he's just got his own specific

145
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:29,439
name because he has such a stud

146
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:31,839
all of the female the rise plants get

147
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:34,478
labeled a rise and then a number arise

148
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:35,679
f2 number two or rise f1 number four

149
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:38,319
things like that sit around in the

150
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:41,360
garden but the arise male he has simply

151
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:43,839
named king solomon so the king solomon

152
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,919
arise is golden goat and daybreaker that

153
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:47,439
was a golden goat female pollinated by a

154
00:05:45,918 --> 00:05:49,758
daybreaker male

155
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:51,600
my arise is fairly well known there's a

156
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:54,080
lot of info on the internet a lot of

157
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,639
pictures it is well known for producing

158
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:58,800
uh very high thc the offspring come out

159
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:01,199
with very high thc almost anything i

160
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,520
pollinate with that king solomon will

161
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,600
come out with extreme potency almost

162
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:07,519
like panic attack potency almost like

163
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,160
freak you out psychedelic almost type

164
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:12,000
potency it's really i call it the fixer

165
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,160
plant king solomon likes to fix and

166
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,319
improve everything also it's known for

167
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,400
making plants grow with what we call

168
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,479
hyper vigor it makes them grow very very

169
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:21,918
quickly they get big plants that root

170
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:24,000
quite quite well

171
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:25,519
that is king solomon that is a rise all

172
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,519
right we know the parents now let's talk

173
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:29,839
a little bit about how the parents grow

174
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:32,399
and then we'll segue into how the cross

175
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:34,879
itself grows uh the chem daily chem it

176
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:37,439
gets a little bit tall and kind of lanky

177
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:41,199
but it turns into what i call just

178
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:42,959
spears of nasty dank it's just long

179
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,439
thick buds with beautiful colors

180
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:46,799
beautiful aromas lots of trichomes and

181
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:49,439
it just smells

182
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,360
nasty delicious if it wasn't cannabis

183
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:52,800
you would make it go far away if it

184
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,400
smelled like that anything else that

185
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,240
smelled like that you would put it in

186
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:58,399
two or three bags and seal it up and get

187
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,560
rid of it maybe burn it with fire maybe

188
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:03,359
destroy it but since it's cannabis it is

189
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,199
such a tremendously uh desirable smell i

190
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,038
love it i can't get enough it's like ooh

191
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,639
that stinks i want to smell it again oh

192
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:10,240
that stinks so bad i want to smell it

193
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,240
again and when you smoke it people

194
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,918
around you they go damn that weed stinks

195
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,918
can i get an eighth like they want some

196
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:18,159
of it immediately because it smells so

197
00:07:15,918 --> 00:07:20,799
good so that is the chem de la chem gets

198
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,280
a little bit tall kind of lanky

199
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,120
but just [ __ ] gassy and delicious

200
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:28,000
then the arise i mentioned that one

201
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:30,160
hyper vigor hyper potency super fast

202
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,199
grow fast growing plant so that's what

203
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,080
we're going to talk about about the

204
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:37,120
parents now why did i want to make this

205
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:39,359
cross because i love that kem de la chem

206
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,439
skunk gassy funk i don't have enough of

207
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,080
that in my lineup it's something i'm

208
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:45,680
really uh it feels like we go in circles

209
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:47,680
with the flavors of cannabis that are

210
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,199
desired for a while there uh it was

211
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,598
nothing but skunk and then it turned

212
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:54,080
into diesel and then it turned into uh

213
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:56,560
kush was popular in the denver area and

214
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:58,399
then everybody wanted chem and then uh

215
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,319
then everybody wanted garlic and then

216
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:02,478
everybody wanted candy oh then cookies

217
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,080
was popular and then garlic came around

218
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:06,560
and now it's all the uh

219
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:08,318
the dessert strains and the the fruity

220
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,160
flavored candy dessert stuff is what's

221
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,319
popular now like if you got a fruit

222
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,000
flavor and a dessert in your name like

223
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,080
watermelon gelato or something that

224
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,160
shit's what everybody wants right now so

225
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:20,240
i feel like my terp wheel is coming back

226
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,240
around to liking that skunky diesely

227
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:25,598
stuff that i used to like uh probably

228
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:27,360
around uh 98 99 early 2000's that's what

229
00:08:25,598 --> 00:08:28,800
was real popular so i'm coming back

230
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,160
around to liking that i wanted more of

231
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,360
that in my lineup i'm trying not to

232
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,918
ramble too much we're gonna get me back

233
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:36,479
on track uh so i really love the flavors

234
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:38,799
and aromas of the camdella kim also i

235
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,399
really i like jj as a breeder and that's

236
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:41,759
where this cross came from so i wanted

237
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,918
to do some breeding with some of his

238
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:45,600
stuff just uh you gotta gotta breed with

239
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:48,559
the people work with the people that you

240
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:51,680
uh respect and uh appreciate so that's

241
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:53,439
mostly why i made it and i knew that um

242
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:55,199
that growth that comes from the arise

243
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,680
and the potency from the arise with that

244
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,519
skunky funkiness it's just like putting

245
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:00,719
uh two supermodels in a room together

246
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,480
knowing that i'm just going to make a

247
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,480
super super model i knew it was going to

248
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,480
work well so that's basically why i made

249
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,240
the cross as a breeder as a grower as a

250
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,159
smoker i felt like all the right

251
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,399
ingredients were there if i put those

252
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:14,399
together it was going to work very well

253
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,320
and i feel like we did reach our goal

254
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,720
we'll talk more about that in the future

255
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:22,480
now let's talk about why i named this

256
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:24,399
cross the machine a lot of it came from

257
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,278
excuse me a lot of it came from the

258
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:29,600
flavors and aromas that come from this

259
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:31,919
finished plant it's got chemicals and

260
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,000
greasy smells and funky stuff kind of

261
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:37,120
machine shop sort of smells but also i

262
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,278
named it the machine in honor of

263
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,360
bert kreischer if you know me at all you

264
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:43,278
know that i'm a huge comedy nerd i love

265
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,440
going to comedy shows i love watching

266
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:47,759
comedy shows i listen to podcasts all

267
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,279
day constantly when i work i'm a huge

268
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:51,679
fan of laughter one of the people that

269
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:53,919
makes me laugh the most is [ __ ]

270
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:55,439
brent chrysler that dude will make you

271
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:57,278
laugh you're right make me laugh my ass

272
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,720
off i could be working hard i could be

273
00:09:57,278 --> 00:10:01,039
in a funky mood it could be early in the

274
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,959
morning and burnt chrysler will say

275
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:04,480
something ridiculous on a podcast and i

276
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:07,278
will laugh until i have to go take a

277
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:09,278
piss so i had to make a a strain named

278
00:10:07,278 --> 00:10:11,120
after my friend burke kirschner just

279
00:10:09,278 --> 00:10:13,919
because i felt like it was appropriate

280
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,839
so it is named after bert kirschner on

281
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:17,278
i'm trolling his name it is bert

282
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,040
kreisher ladies and gentlemen the strain

283
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:21,200
is named after bert kreischer i've been

284
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:23,759
naming strains after grateful dead songs

285
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,759
after reggae artists after uh mystical

286
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:27,759
things and motivational things and i

287
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:29,278
love comedy and i love laughter so i

288
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:31,838
decided it was time to name a strain

289
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:33,919
after one of my favorite comedians so

290
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:36,640
bert kreischer got a strain named after

291
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:38,719
him the machine comes from a long story

292
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:40,399
that bert tells in one of his specials

293
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,839
and it is about how i don't want to ruin

294
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,919
his joke but if you haven't heard it by

295
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:46,079
now i don't know where you have been uh

296
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:48,078
bert crisher uh learns russian in

297
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:49,519
college he doesn't learn russian at all

298
00:10:48,078 --> 00:10:51,278
but he gets to go on a free trip to

299
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,679
russia he becomes involved in the

300
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:56,480
russian mafia and he tells them that he

301
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:58,078
is the machine and it's a hit so that is

302
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:01,039
where it comes from it comes from the i

303
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:02,799
am the machine joke from brent kirschner

304
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:05,120
that is where the name comes from i've

305
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:07,838
rambled for a long time about that let's

306
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,519
talk about the actual strain big shout

307
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,839
out to burke crusher by the way that

308
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:14,000
dude has made me laugh a lot um the

309
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,680
flowering time so we've talked about the

310
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,799
cross we've talked about the parents a

311
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:18,319
lot of people are going to want to know

312
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:20,000
the flowering time of this strain let's

313
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,320
get back into grower mode here the

314
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,360
flowering time of the machine most

315
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:27,600
phenotypes will finish within 63 to 70

316
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:30,399
days some of them maybe let them go

317
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:33,759
about 72 days those super chem heavy

318
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:37,200
gassy stanky ones maybe 72 days but 60

319
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:40,078
to 70 days is the prime zone about 63 65

320
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:43,440
days is where most of the phenotypes are

321
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:45,199
going to be finished aromas and flavors

322
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,640
i've talked about this a little bit this

323
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,879
is part of why i got the name the

324
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:50,559
machine there are chemical flavors there

325
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:52,559
are chemical smells there are gassy

326
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:54,879
smells sometimes there's a hint of like

327
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:56,958
lemon fuel but it's mostly chemicals

328
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:58,559
gassy funky dirtiness

329
00:11:56,958 --> 00:12:00,559
there's hints of coffee

330
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:01,679
some lower notes in there but a lot of

331
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:04,239
chemically

332
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:06,159
machine shop greasy kind of smells it's

333
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,079
really kind of overwhelming honestly

334
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:09,519
sometimes some phenotypes it'll make

335
00:12:08,078 --> 00:12:10,958
your eyes kind of itchy kind of burning

336
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:13,039
when you're trimming it

337
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:14,638
let's talk about growth shapes and

338
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:17,278
structures a lot of people growing this

339
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:19,919
are going to want to know what to expect

340
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:22,958
most of the phenotypes are going to make

341
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:25,599
long branches there are what i call the

342
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:27,599
chem and the kush phenotypes which are

343
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,200
usually pretty identifiable if you've

344
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,879
grown any chem you know that it kind of

345
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,800
stays a little bit tighter it makes

346
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:34,399
those long spear type nuggets if you've

347
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:35,919
grown kush you know it makes kind of

348
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,000
more like popcorn balls and kind of

349
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:41,360
stretchier plants so let's talk a little

350
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,839
bit about that the chem it is spears and

351
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:47,200
tighter nodes and earlier in flower it's

352
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:49,680
got a nasty berries sort of a smell it's

353
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:52,000
like dirty funky smells like rotten

354
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:53,838
putrid stuff and berries at the same

355
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,519
time which later turns into a skunky

356
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:58,720
gassy kind of a thing when you dry it

357
00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:00,639
and cure it that is the chem ah the chem

358
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,720
dominant phenotype that one in my

359
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:06,560
opinion it smells like the old school

360
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:08,959
original chem 91 so that is the the chem

361
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:10,638
dominant phenotype there is a cush

362
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:12,399
dominant phenotype like i said before

363
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:14,159
it's got longer branches if you've ever

364
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:16,639
grown kush you know that some of the

365
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:18,159
older old-school og kush just it just

366
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:19,839
gets real branchy and then when you

367
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:21,759
flower it all those branches kind of

368
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:23,839
fill in with big popcorn ball nugs and

369
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:26,399
the top makes a big glory bud that's

370
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:29,760
kind of what the kush dominant phenotype

371
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:30,559
does the kush phenotype will be earthy

372
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:32,799
and

373
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:34,958
just earthy and dirtier in aromas it's

374
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:36,159
going to be not as berries not as gassy

375
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:37,838
more earthy you're going to get an

376
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:39,919
earthy dirty thing i keep saying earthy

377
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:42,079
i hope i've made that point clear that

378
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:44,078
one is going to be more chill more

379
00:13:42,078 --> 00:13:46,319
indica dominant buzz more put you in the

380
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:48,319
couch more knock you out that one's got

381
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,920
big fat whiter leaves you will notice

382
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,879
that phenotype

383
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:55,278
the chem is gassier and nasty and also i

384
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:57,679
wrote down a head killer the chem

385
00:13:55,278 --> 00:13:59,198
dominant phenotype the buzz will make

386
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:01,120
you forget where you were and what

387
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:02,958
you're doing while you were doing it

388
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,799
you'll be walking to the fridge to get a

389
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:06,319
drink and you'll forget that you needed

390
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:08,319
a drink until you realize you're so

391
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,519
thirsty that your mouth is stuck to your

392
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,040
face

393
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:13,600
most of these phenotypes come out

394
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:15,439
distinctly chem or distinctly cush and

395
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:18,240
it is very noticeable very few of them

396
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:20,480
show much of the golden goat trait other

397
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,320
than the the fast growth and the high

398
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,320
potency i think a lot of that

399
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,440
is attributed to by the golden goat so

400
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,839
you're getting the

401
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,680
aromas and flavors of the cushion chem

402
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,760
and the speed of the growth and that

403
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:33,359
high potency is kicking in from that

404
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:35,120
tropical part of the sativa that's where

405
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,839
i think that comes in but you're going

406
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:40,000
to find very heavy kush phenotypes and

407
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:41,440
very heavy chem phenotypes and then

408
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,039
things right in the middle so you'll be

409
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,560
able to find something that's got the

410
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:46,159
amount of couch lock you want the amount

411
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:47,759
of head buzz you like and then that

412
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:49,519
right in the middle beautiful buzz that

413
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:51,120
i really enjoy that kind of sits you

414
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,720
down and makes you think all you can do

415
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,720
is just sit there and ponder life for a

416
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,240
little bit or you end up staring at a

417
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,360
painting and seeing a totally different

418
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,198
painting in that painting that you've

419
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,759
never seen before that's the kind of

420
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:03,919
herb that this is here you got the gassy

421
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:05,919
the chemi the cushy and the potency of

422
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:08,479
that tropical stuff now within these

423
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:10,240
ranges of cush and chem i do find what i

424
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,639
believe to be three

425
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,720
not distinct phenotypes but basically

426
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,959
categories of phenotypes there are

427
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,600
probably uh several phenotypes that will

428
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:22,159
pop up this is an f1 hybrid i do enjoy

429
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,159
the variation but there are three

430
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:26,000
categories of phenotypes that i have

431
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:28,399
distinctly identified let's talk about

432
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,559
those three categories there is what i

433
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:35,519
call the pinecone category which uh that

434
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:37,758
one is the kush og kush type of category

435
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:39,360
it's gonna smell more musty more earthy

436
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:41,199
you're gonna get your coffee or

437
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,639
chocolate your indica dominant

438
00:15:41,198 --> 00:15:44,240
phenotypes are going to be that one it's

439
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:45,680
going to be more pine cone size and

440
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,680
shape buds

441
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:49,679
more jaggedy buds they're going to be

442
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:52,078
your pine cone size and shape buds all

443
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:53,519
over the plant not as big long spears i

444
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:54,879
only say that because there is another

445
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,879
phenotype called the spear which we'll

446
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:58,879
talk about in a minute but these pine

447
00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:01,439
cone shaped buds are going to be the

448
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:03,838
gassy musty flavors and aromas your

449
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,839
cushy type varieties uh like i said a

450
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,959
moment ago your bigger leaf varieties

451
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,720
these are going to be what i call the

452
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:11,278
pine cone phenotype that is going to be

453
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:14,639
og kush dominant then there is what i

454
00:16:11,278 --> 00:16:16,320
call the foxtail phenotype there are

455
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:19,198
some phenotypes within this line that

456
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:22,000
just simply produce foxtails that comes

457
00:16:19,198 --> 00:16:23,599
from the chem d and the genetics we

458
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,519
don't see that a lot pop up in the chem

459
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,199
but things that are made with the chem

460
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:29,120
do make that trait we see that in the

461
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:32,000
gmo i've seen it in some other chem

462
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:34,000
crosses that is not your fault possibly

463
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,159
not your fault that very well could be

464
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,399
from the genetics if you get minimal fox

465
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:41,360
tailing it's not crazy we just see some

466
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,720
bulbous uh calyxes little extra bulbous

467
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,159
uh what do we want to call them brax

468
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,920
they swell a little bit more they stack

469
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:48,159
up a little bit harder than you're used

470
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:50,159
to that is just a trait from the chem

471
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:52,480
you're not doing anything wrong then

472
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:54,799
there is another very distinct maybe a

473
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:57,519
phenotype maybe a category of phenotypes

474
00:16:54,799 --> 00:17:00,479
which i call the spears these are the

475
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:02,639
stinky chem dominant phenotypes they're

476
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,959
just long spears of bud they get a

477
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:07,838
silvery sort of a tint to them uh maybe

478
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:09,839
a purple hue with silver trichomes up

479
00:17:07,838 --> 00:17:12,240
and down them they look velvety they are

480
00:17:09,838 --> 00:17:14,720
beautiful plants they stink like skunk

481
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:17,279
and gas and chemicals those are the

482
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:20,318
three distinct phenotypes the pine cone

483
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:23,759
is the gassy one uh the spears is that

484
00:17:20,318 --> 00:17:25,599
chem dominant one the foxtails is very

485
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:27,038
potent and seems to kind of be the blend

486
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:29,359
you got that chem in there and then it's

487
00:17:27,038 --> 00:17:31,440
got that uh it's got the chem from the

488
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:33,918
structure it's got that cushy flavor and

489
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,679
aroma beautiful blend of both so if

490
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,520
you're looking for more of a head buzz

491
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:39,280
you want the one with the long

492
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:40,720
spear buds and the longer leaves if you

493
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:43,119
want to sit down on your ass and be

494
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,720
knocked out get that fat leaf one if

495
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:46,159
you're looking for that beautiful blend

496
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,880
and with all the beautiful terps you

497
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:50,400
might want that fox tail phenotype now

498
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,320
if you're looking at my social media and

499
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,320
watching the photos you'll see that zoso

500
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:56,399
j got one of the plants that i may

501
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:58,480
actually consider that fox tailey

502
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,480
phenotype it's not extreme foxtails but

503
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:03,279
you'll see what i mean by the bulbous

504
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,038
calyxes the swollen bracks all over it's

505
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:06,960
a beautiful plant but it did do a little

506
00:18:05,038 --> 00:18:09,679
fox tailing that was not zozo jay's

507
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,038
fault that is simply attributed to the

508
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:13,519
genetics then if you look at a lot of

509
00:18:11,038 --> 00:18:14,400
the plants that mobius mobius grows on

510
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:16,798
instagram

511
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,400
he got the chem and the kush dominant

512
00:18:16,798 --> 00:18:20,400
phenotypes and posted a lot of pictures

513
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,080
of both of them uh the one with no

514
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,519
leaves that is the kush dominant

515
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:26,399
phenotype and the one with a lot of

516
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:28,798
leaves that is more chem dominant i can

517
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:31,038
tell by looking i can almost imagine and

518
00:18:28,798 --> 00:18:33,279
predict the aromas of the two phenotypes

519
00:18:31,038 --> 00:18:34,558
i saw from mobius just by looking at the

520
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:36,879
photos all right i'm going to check out

521
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:38,319
my notes see where we are here all right

522
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:41,440
now we're to the part of the notes where

523
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:43,599
it says tips and tricks and details this

524
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,519
is where we're going to give the breeder

525
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:47,839
nuances the breeder tips and tricks on

526
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:49,119
how to maximize the potential of the

527
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:52,159
machine

528
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:53,839
um this one is a very fast vegging plant

529
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,440
a lot of my plants grow very fast all

530
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:58,240
the way through their life this one

531
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:00,480
grows very very quickly and veg however

532
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,599
it does slow down when you flip it into

533
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,839
flower

534
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:06,399
that is quite the opposite of a lot of

535
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:08,079
plants they usually do go a lot faster

536
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,759
this one will kind of slow down so you

537
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:11,359
don't have to worry you do have to worry

538
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:13,200
about the stretch but it is not as

539
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:15,359
extreme it will probably

540
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,600
double in size by the time you were done

541
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:19,519
flowering so if you've got a six foot of

542
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:20,959
flowering space flower it at three feet

543
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:22,240
of course allow for light space and

544
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,120
whatnot but you understand what i'm

545
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,120
saying

546
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:26,639
your three foot tall plant will be six

547
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:28,959
feet tall by the time it's done if it's

548
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,880
two feet tall expect four feet by the

549
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,558
time your plant finishes a lot of the

550
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,039
test growers did report that these

551
00:19:32,558 --> 00:19:37,119
plants do take a lot of nutrients they

552
00:19:35,038 --> 00:19:39,119
will suck up a lot of nitrogen and veg

553
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:40,719
because they do grow quite quickly and

554
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:42,959
they do continue to eat a lot of

555
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:45,440
nutrients throughout the flowering phase

556
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:47,759
so feed these plants heavy do pay very

557
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,519
close attention to your plants if they

558
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:52,000
show you any signs of deficiency or

559
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:54,160
signs of burn adjust accordingly but we

560
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,400
do have reports that they eat a lot so i

561
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:59,679
can warn you to feed them heavy from the

562
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:01,600
beginning also myself and a lot of test

563
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:03,840
growers notice that these plants do tend

564
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:05,599
to like it a little bit drier you don't

565
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:07,599
need to water these plants as frequently

566
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:10,719
as heavily you can let them get a little

567
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:13,359
bit drier which is often the case with

568
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,640
most cush dominant varietals things from

569
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:16,639
the cush line

570
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,480
the og cushes the old kush stuff the

571
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,080
tahoe the sfv

572
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,400
that stuff does better when you let it

573
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:24,720
dry out you're more likely to drown a

574
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,000
kush plant than you are to let it dry so

575
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,880
if you've got a

576
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,119
if you've got a cush dominant phenotype

577
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:33,120
those plants will like much drier

578
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:34,959
conditions as you lean more toward the

579
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:37,038
chem dominant phenotypes they may want a

580
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,880
little bit more but we did notice that

581
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:40,798
they do tend to like it a little bit

582
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,960
drier witch if you're growing a lot of

583
00:20:40,798 --> 00:20:45,200
og kush stuff that is a trait that the

584
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:48,640
og kush it's very common across the

585
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:50,640
entire kush family alright so it does

586
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,640
also this is also a trait that is very

587
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:55,038
common across the kush family these

588
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:57,200
plants will eat a lot of cow mag if you

589
00:20:55,038 --> 00:20:58,960
feed them cow mag you'll see the leaves

590
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,120
give you big fat serrations the leaves

591
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,519
will get bold and strong don't overdo it

592
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:04,558
but they do like cal mag they will get

593
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:06,240
calmag

594
00:21:04,558 --> 00:21:07,839
calcium deficient

595
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,759
in mid flour if you don't feed them

596
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:11,678
enough calcium i know i say calmag all

597
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:13,279
the time together usually they're sold

598
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:14,960
in the same bottle i try to keep it easy

599
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:16,639
for everybody they're going to get

600
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,480
calcium deficient as the one that you're

601
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:21,038
going to see i've also learned that

602
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:23,599
feeding kush and chem plants kelp

603
00:21:21,038 --> 00:21:26,319
products or kelp really do increase the

604
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:29,519
potency and that stanky aroma that

605
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:32,000
skunky gassy cushy earthy [ __ ] that is

606
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:34,879
really enhanced in my opinion in my

607
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,720
experience by feeding a good kelp

608
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,960
product in flowers so if you can add

609
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:41,200
some kelp products that will really add

610
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,120
to your stinkiness now let's talk a

611
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,679
little bit about the growth of these

612
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:47,599
plants i did mention that the chem de la

613
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:50,000
chem does like to get tall it likes to

614
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:52,959
grow long branches the arise does like

615
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,279
to make big tall fast growing plants so

616
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,600
i do recommend trellising or tomato

617
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:59,678
cages or some sort of supports for these

618
00:21:57,599 --> 00:22:01,439
plants these plants will trellis

619
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:03,280
very well they pop and twist well they

620
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,558
spread out very well when you spread

621
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:06,960
them and bend them it just makes more

622
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:10,240
shoots and those grow up as well i do

623
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:12,079
recommend supports early i would trellis

624
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:15,519
them out in veg have that trellis all

625
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:17,199
set up or have your tomato cages or your

626
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:18,798
sticks ready because when those buds

627
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,558
start setting in they're going to get

628
00:22:18,798 --> 00:22:21,918
top heavy you're going to fill up big

629
00:22:20,558 --> 00:22:23,918
spears of buds they're going to start

630
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:25,280
toppling over you're going to get sticky

631
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:27,759
and stinky it's going to be a pain in

632
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:30,639
the ass if you don't start getting them

633
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:33,200
supported ahead talking about supporting

634
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:35,600
our plants these plants really bulk up

635
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,679
in the last two weeks of flower myself

636
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:39,599
and all of the test growers really

637
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:42,080
mentioned and really noticed that these

638
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:43,519
plants beef up and bulk up the last two

639
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:45,918
weeks of flower that's why i recommend

640
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:48,480
you let them go the 70 maybe 72 days the

641
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:50,880
first time you grow them let them go and

642
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:53,679
see what they do that last 10 14 days

643
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:55,440
they really might expand bulk up beef up

644
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:57,038
on you you would hate to cut down at

645
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,038
week nine and week ten they really

646
00:22:57,038 --> 00:23:00,400
exploded and you wasted some growth on

647
00:22:59,038 --> 00:23:02,319
there wasted some weight that really

648
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,798
could have helped you out so let them

649
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:07,279
finish they really bulk up in the last

650
00:23:04,798 --> 00:23:09,839
two weeks we did notice that temperature

651
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:12,079
swings really make these plants colorful

652
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:14,079
these plants acted really really well to

653
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:15,599
cold temperatures during the night we

654
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:18,158
had some really drastic temperature

655
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:19,839
swings here in colorado one of my test

656
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:22,000
places was getting really hot during the

657
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:24,240
day and really cold at night some of the

658
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
plants we'll talk about that one later

659
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:29,120
some of the plants did not like the cold

660
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,679
at all the the machine really seemed to

661
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:33,439
run well in the cold at night it really

662
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:34,798
brought out the colors made the buds

663
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,880
nice and dense

664
00:23:34,798 --> 00:23:39,359
i really think it reacted responded very

665
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:41,278
well to those cold night temperatures

666
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:43,839
toward the end of flower

667
00:23:41,278 --> 00:23:46,798
the machine is now what i would call the

668
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:49,038
gassiest and stankiest strain in my

669
00:23:46,798 --> 00:23:50,879
lineup that is now available

670
00:23:49,038 --> 00:23:53,119
it compares very closely in stank and

671
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:55,278
aroma to the double dose and also it

672
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:57,359
would compete with the dark hollow but

673
00:23:55,278 --> 00:23:59,839
it is now what i would call the gassiest

674
00:23:57,359 --> 00:24:02,479
in my lineup that that camera roma that

675
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:05,519
chem stank you just can't beat it it's

676
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:07,360
got it just so skunky stinky

677
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:09,119
it is gross in a delicious way i said

678
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:10,000
that earlier it's like you smell it and

679
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:12,719
you're like

680
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,119
that's gross can i smell it again just

681
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:17,278
something disgustingly pleasing about it

682
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:19,519
um that being said

683
00:24:17,278 --> 00:24:22,960
i think it is best to have carbon

684
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:25,119
filters it is i would recommend and over

685
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:27,440
recommend and highly suggest again that

686
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:29,759
you've got carbon filters and extra odor

687
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,759
control i said before when you trim this

688
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:33,440
one when i trim this one i don't trim a

689
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:35,359
lot of plants i grow little tiny plants

690
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,440
we did test runs when we would crack

691
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:39,678
open these plants to trim them my eyes

692
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,200
would get like just it would i'd feel

693
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:42,400
like there was chemicals in my eyes they

694
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,080
would burn and they would itch it was

695
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:46,720
almost like i was allergic to it in a

696
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:49,359
good way uh when you crack open a bag it

697
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:51,200
makes my eyes itch like it's almost like

698
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:53,519
a uh it's like a pavlov effect a

699
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,960
pavlonian pavlovian how do you whatever

700
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:57,599
pavlov shout out to that dude and his

701
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:59,360
dogs pavlovian i think that's how you

702
00:24:57,599 --> 00:25:01,759
say it it's that sort of effect when i

703
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:03,678
would open up the jar my eyes would itch

704
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:05,119
and burn like it does when i smoke it

705
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:06,880
and i'm not saying itch and burn in a

706
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:08,879
bad way but it would get my eyes my eyes

707
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,799
would go heavy and droopy and i think

708
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,080
the smell would trigger my body and my

709
00:25:10,798 --> 00:25:14,319
eyes would just go oh yeah you're gonna

710
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:16,558
get that nice head buzz pretty soon here

711
00:25:14,319 --> 00:25:19,519
but just trimming it made my eyes itch

712
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:21,599
and burn it is super gassy super stinky

713
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:24,000
um it will be when you're trimming it

714
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:26,319
will be some of the most pungent uh

715
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,400
stankiest offensive herb you ever

716
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:30,879
experience offensive is the word i was

717
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:33,600
looking for one good thing to mention

718
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,760
these plants are very resistant to mold

719
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:37,359
and mites people grew this one outdoors

720
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:39,278
it did not get the mildew that a lot of

721
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:41,519
people experienced i have a good friend

722
00:25:39,278 --> 00:25:42,880
who got they got some problematic bugs

723
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:45,119
during their grow and they said that

724
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,960
this plant was basically left alone by

725
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:48,639
some of their mites so a lot of the

726
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:51,600
testers did report that these plants

727
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:53,520
were resistant to mildew and to bugs we

728
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:55,759
had a lot of people grow these outdoors

729
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:58,639
nobody uh reported any powdery mildew

730
00:25:55,759 --> 00:26:00,079
nobody reported any bud rot also i did

731
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,759
have a friend who grew this in a room

732
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:04,240
with mites they did not get mites on

733
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:05,759
this plant so it is bug resistant that

734
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,120
is always a good thing so we have

735
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:09,278
learned that these plants are very

736
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:11,678
resistant to bugs very resistant to

737
00:26:09,278 --> 00:26:13,278
pathogens and mold so knowing that these

738
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:15,360
plants are resistant to pathogens

739
00:26:13,278 --> 00:26:17,679
resistant to bugs and they also grow

740
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:19,839
super quickly they smell really good

741
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:22,080
they're super photogenic they come out

742
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:24,079
with extremely high potency they

743
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:26,000
tolerate a lot of problems i think that

744
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:27,839
these plants would be great for beginner

745
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,159
growers the only thing i would really

746
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:32,480
worry about is over watering but for

747
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:34,159
people who may not be able to get to the

748
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:36,640
grow as often for people who aren't in

749
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:38,960
there all day for people who may forget

750
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:41,278
to water these may be great plants uh

751
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,120
like i said other than that uh the

752
00:26:41,278 --> 00:26:44,319
opportunity to over water these plants

753
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:46,479
and the idea that they don't like as

754
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:48,879
much water these are great plants for

755
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:51,200
beginner growers now let's talk a little

756
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,720
bit about the smoke i've gotten to smoke

757
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,080
a few of the flowers from a couple of

758
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,640
different grows

759
00:26:54,079 --> 00:27:00,240
something that i noticed is this cushy

760
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:01,919
chemi chemical gassy aroma when i hit it

761
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,519
it just feels like chemicals and

762
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:05,600
cottonmouth coat my tongue and when i

763
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:08,240
exhale that flavor and aroma just

764
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:10,480
lingers and my eyes get heavy right away

765
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:12,159
and i can't get that smell off of my

766
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,919
hands i can wash my hands two or three

767
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:15,840
times and if you smoke a joint if you

768
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:17,759
break up a joint and smoke a joint of

769
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:20,158
this weed your fingers will smell like

770
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:23,519
it for the rest of the weekend this was

771
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:25,440
also super thick smoke i smoked two two

772
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:26,798
batches of flowers that made me say that

773
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,399
reminds me of back in the day when we

774
00:27:26,798 --> 00:27:30,879
used to say we got the chronic and the

775
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:32,879
smoke expands in your lungs this weed

776
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,399
gave me that lung expandy feeling that i

777
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,159
haven't had in a little bit

778
00:27:34,398 --> 00:27:37,759
i smoke a lot of flowers i smoke a lot

779
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:40,000
of dabs and there's just something in

780
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:41,919
the lungs that i haven't felt in a long

781
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,679
time and i enjoyed it reminded me like i

782
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:45,520
said of that old school and we used to

783
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:46,640
call it the chronic it would expand in

784
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:49,759
your lungs and you would smoke it it

785
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:51,278
kind of reminded me of that feeling i

786
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:52,960
did have a friend in denver make some

787
00:27:51,278 --> 00:27:54,558
concentrates i've got a friend they are

788
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,919
two friends they're a lovely couple big

789
00:27:54,558 --> 00:27:58,000
shout out they do not want their names

790
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:59,600
set on the show they made that clear uh

791
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,200
they are a couple they grow and make

792
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:03,278
concentrates in denver they made some

793
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,519
concentrates of the machine i tried to

794
00:28:03,278 --> 00:28:07,919
smoke some before a podcast one night

795
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:09,759
and i do not remember writing recording

796
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:12,320
editing doing that show it was all a

797
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:14,480
blur uh that concentrates from the

798
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:16,000
machine it is like the thing from the

799
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,278
guys that men in black have they go

800
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,960
blink blink and then your whole memory

801
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:21,278
is gone you don't know what happened

802
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:24,399
that is what this stuff is like i just

803
00:28:21,278 --> 00:28:25,919
emptied my brain i enjoyed it uh but if

804
00:28:24,398 --> 00:28:27,678
you've got something to do maybe if you

805
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:29,200
got something to do you don't want to do

806
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:31,278
this would be the perfect smoke for that

807
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:34,080
because it made me uh it just made my

808
00:28:31,278 --> 00:28:35,278
brain numb i forgot everything also

809
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:37,199
after that

810
00:28:35,278 --> 00:28:40,398
when i got done recording while i was

811
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:43,360
editing i ate everything it seems like

812
00:28:40,398 --> 00:28:45,759
when i smoked the machine i get extreme

813
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:47,038
munchies so if you are if you're a

814
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:48,798
cancer patient or if you've got a

815

medicine or something that is stopping

816
00:28:48,798 --> 00:28:52,558
you from eating if you need an increased

817
00:28:50,558 --> 00:28:54,480
appetite the machine may be a great

818
00:28:52,558 --> 00:28:56,398
medical strain for you it may help you

819
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,399
out may increase that appetite may help

820
00:28:56,398 --> 00:29:00,479
you put some weight on uh help you build

821
00:28:58,398 --> 00:29:02,959
bulk up for the winter here uh where am

822
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,960
i i'm looking for my uh my notes here uh

823
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:08,079
overall this was an easy to grow strain

824
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:09,919
and top quality um you can grow this one

825
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:11,519
if you're a beginner grower as long as

826
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:12,960
you don't over water this plant you can

827
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:14,480
grow this and it looks like you grew

828
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,558
something that should have been super

829
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,839
challenging to grow this is an easy

830
00:29:16,558 --> 00:29:19,759
plant to grow that will put out

831
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:20,639
connoisseur smoke as a note that i wrote

832
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:22,720
down

833
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,080
it handles over feeding it'll handle

834
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,600
under feeding but you've got to pay

835
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:27,918
attention to it it'll come out better if

836
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:30,158
you feed it properly every plant will it

837
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:31,679
handles temp swings well it is super

838
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:34,000
easy to trim

839
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:36,240
big fat bag of peel the nugs the dried

840
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,880
and cured nugs look beautiful

841
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:41,200
big fat pine cones big long spears

842
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,799
beautiful dark colors uh beautiful

843
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:46,480
layers of trichomes

844
00:29:42,798 --> 00:29:48,480
super frosty gross aromas nice dense

845
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,480
nugs lots of dense dense nuggets come

846
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,798
out of these crosses i wrote down again

847
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:55,120
easy for beginners low maintenance if

848
00:29:52,798 --> 00:29:57,359
you time it right the biggest issue will

849
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:59,678
be height and stank and something to

850
00:29:57,359 --> 00:30:01,359
look out for will be over watering you

851
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:03,278
do have to time it correctly flower

852
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:05,038
early if you were limited on space

853
00:30:03,278 --> 00:30:06,798
flower early because this one's going to

854
00:30:05,038 --> 00:30:09,679
double in height on you it's going to

855
00:30:06,798 --> 00:30:11,200
veg very very quickly then it's going to

856
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:13,440
flower and it will double in height so

857
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,759
make sure you are prepared for that uh

858
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:18,320
it's great plants for quick runs because

859
00:30:15,759 --> 00:30:20,720
it veges so quickly and is ready to flip

860
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:22,639
early most of the time you may uh you

861
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,159
may be vegging for four to six weeks you

862
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,520
may want to cut that down and just plan

863
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:27,278
on the four because they're going to go

864
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:29,119
so quickly it may save you a couple of

865
00:30:27,278 --> 00:30:30,720
weeks which is always a good thing in a

866
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:31,839
grow that gets more plants more grows

867
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,759
per year

868
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:35,918
it doesn't require a lot of attention

869
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:38,079
get it supported pull a few leaves feed

870
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:40,320
the [ __ ] out of it and i wrote down she

871
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:42,240
will bang so it's a pretty easy plant to

872
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:44,319
grow if you flip it early don't get it

873
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:46,319
too tall if you do get her too tall you

874
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:47,839
could pop her twister bender

875
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:49,439
tie her down do what you need to do she

876
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:51,359
takes very well to that sort of stuff

877
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:54,000
she does recover very quickly and very

878
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:55,599
well from popping topping and abuse i

879
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,759
think the machine is a great plant for

880
00:30:55,599 --> 00:31:00,079
quick runs because she veges super

881
00:30:57,759 --> 00:31:01,759
quickly she flowers in about nine or ten

882
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:03,278
weeks which is great for top quality

883
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:05,519
product i'm sure you can find a

884
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:07,519
phenotype that is done in nine weeks it

885
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:09,038
will suit your purposes all right i do

886
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:11,200
have one more detail before i start

887
00:31:09,038 --> 00:31:13,278
wrapping up this show if i were going to

888
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:15,038
grow a run of the machine right now with

889
00:31:13,278 --> 00:31:16,480
what i know about her uh with the

890
00:31:15,038 --> 00:31:18,319
experience i've got with this plant the

891
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,399
way that i would do it is i would

892
00:31:18,319 --> 00:31:22,240
probably run so let me preface by saying

893
00:31:20,398 --> 00:31:24,719
a lot of people are probably growing in

894
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:27,038
a five by five tent or something similar

895
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:29,600
uh maybe a small room a lot of us don't

896
00:31:27,038 --> 00:31:31,759
have major uh high ceilings uh we've got

897
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:33,678
a little bit of space to work with in a

898
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:36,079
five by five tent or something similar

899
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:37,519
this is probably what i would do i would

900
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:40,480
probably do

901
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:43,120
nine three gallon pots and i would veg

902
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:46,399
them up until they are about 12 to 18

903
00:31:43,119 --> 00:31:48,079
inches tall then i would flour them if

904
00:31:46,398 --> 00:31:50,479
you want to spread them out if you want

905
00:31:48,079 --> 00:31:53,759
to trellis them i would top them one

906
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:56,000
time early about 10 to 12 inches tall as

907
00:31:53,759 --> 00:31:57,919
soon as they start branching take a top

908
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,319
out of them then put the trellis net

909
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:01,679
down and spread them out let that go for

910
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:04,319
maybe a week because they're going to

911
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:05,519
veg quickly into that trellis then flip

912
00:32:04,319 --> 00:32:07,119
them because they're going to grow tall

913
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:09,519
and they're going to fill that area so

914
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:12,158
that's the way i would do it three

915
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:14,399
nine three gallon pots veg them until

916
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:16,320
they're about 12 to 18 inches tall then

917
00:32:14,398 --> 00:32:18,798
flip them and they will fill your space

918
00:32:16,319 --> 00:32:21,439
or veg them till they're about 10 or 12

919
00:32:18,798 --> 00:32:23,440
inches tall top them one time spread

920
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:25,840
them out with the trellis let them fill

921
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:27,840
that space then flip them i think you'll

922
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:29,918
be satisfied with that maybe i would

923
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:32,000
consider four seven gallon pots in a

924
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:34,240
five by five space but as quickly as

925
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,919
they veg that may get out of control uh

926
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,759
they may outgrow your space more quickly

927
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:39,200
than you were prepared for but if i

928
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:40,960
wanted to run a quick crop of these

929
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,200
plants the way that i would do it again

930
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:45,200
would be nine three gallon pots in a

931
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,759
five by five veg them until they're

932
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:50,399
about 12 to 18 inches tall then flour

933
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:52,960
them let them flower for uh nine to ten

934
00:32:50,398 --> 00:32:54,798
weeks maybe 72 days at the most chop

935
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:57,759
them dry them cure them you've got a

936
00:32:54,798 --> 00:32:59,839
quick crop of top shelf product in my

937
00:32:57,759 --> 00:33:01,440
opinion you guys i wasn't sure if i was

938
00:32:59,839 --> 00:33:04,398
going to say this but i think i enjoy

939
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:08,000
the machine so much that it may become

940
00:33:04,398 --> 00:33:09,759
my new concert smoke this may replace

941
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,679
the grateful dog the grateful dog has

942
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:15,200
been my go-to choice for concert weed

943
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:16,798
