142
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:04,000
disabled veteran

143
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,239
i suffered a botched whipple surgery

144
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,199
while in the navy in 2003

145
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,480
and willingly would provide proof uh the

146
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:11,518
statement about providing proof is

147
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:11,919
because i have mentioned on the show

148
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,438
that

149
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:15,119
there are too many people out there

150
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:16,478
trying to take advantage of kind people

151
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,478
too many people trying to take

152
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:20,639
advantage of the covid situation and

153
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:21,279
they are taking donations and receiving

154
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,879
gifts

155
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:26,799
uh on un uh deservingly i guess it is uh

156
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:28,959
stolen valor is what they're doing

157
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,478
and this veteran is just saying before

158
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:31,198
you even ask i can prove that i'm a

159
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:32,959
veteran

160
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,560
uh i trust you if you're gonna write in

161
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:36,319
and tell me you're a veteran and not ask

162
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,079
for anything like that i believe you

163
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:40,000
this message all tells me that you were

164
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:41,359
a veteran i have no doubt in there but

165
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,199
thank you for backing that up

166
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,639

169
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:48,959
for half of my lifetime i'm finally

170
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:52,240
getting the courage

171
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:55,039
to cut a cold turkey cut off va

172
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,319
doctor recommended prescription opioids

173
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,400
after 10 years

174
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:59,839
so the veteran doctor was recommending a

175
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:01,918
prescribing opioids

176
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:03,359
for the past 10 years he's finally cut

177
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:04,719
it off and found it difficult so we

178
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,439
turned to the beautiful form of

179
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,120
gardening

180
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:09,360
and found that not only do i have a

181
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,240
great set of green lungs but i also have

182
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,120
a green

183
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,560
thumb to match uh yes being a military

184
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,720
person you have got

185
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,600
uh what's the word dedication uh

186
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,360
discipline

187
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,800
all of that stuff is driven into you and

188
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,560
now you've got passion

189
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,000
so with that dedication passion

190
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,879
discipline you will be an amazing

191
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,240
grower i often find that people with uh

192
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:28,879
kitchen background they've got

193
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,199
discipline

194
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:32,879
and motivation people with martial arts

195
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,840
background wrestling backgrounds people

196
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:35,680
that wrestled in school

197
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:37,119
worked in kitchens they're always good

198
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,038
growers good in the gardens because

199
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,759
they've got that determination that

200
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:41,439
discipline

201
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,600
and then you put passion behind that

202
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:46,560
that turns those people into savages

203
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,280
in the grow room it does go on to say i

204
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,879

205
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:50,399

this and the assist shown to the lady

243
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,800
veteran is the reason for me deciding to

244
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:56,160
become a 10

245
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:59,038
a month financial contributor thank you

246
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,759
i'm sure that being a disabled veteran

247
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:01,839
that

248
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:04,160
you don't have a lot of spare money so

249
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:05,598
that 10 bucks means a lot to me that

250
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,280
you're on a very limited income you

251
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:08,719
don't have a way that i know of that you

252
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:10,239
can just go make extra money a lot of us

253
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,840
can just go get a second job we could do

254
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,280
a side job make some extra money

255
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:15,519
you may not have that option and if you

256
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:17,359
do you may lose some of your benefits so

257
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:19,839
thank you for contributing some of that

258
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,160
allotted money to me i appreciate that i

259
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:23,198
respect that a lot thank you um it goes

260
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,599
on to say

261
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,439
um oh i wanted to put in there uh you're

262
00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:29,120
in the irie army now that's a lot less

263
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:30,959
push-ups and a lot more bong rips that's

264
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,280
actually a note that i wrote on my paper

265
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:34,879
had to say that so it goes on to say not

266
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:36,559
being able to afford the high quality

267
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:38,319
gear i decided that high quality

268
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,038
information is even better

269
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,000
especially when applied properly sounds

270
00:07:41,038 --> 00:07:43,439
like we've got a

271
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,038
macgyver on our hands here and i like

272
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:46,560
this kind of person someone that learns

273
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:48,399
they've got the motivation the

274
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,240
determination the discipline and now

275
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:52,000
when there's a will there is a way

276
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,199
and our macgyver veteran friend here is

277
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,478
going to whip up some [ __ ] and make it

278
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,280
happen i love the way he does it we'll

279
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:57,839
keep going

280
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:58,638
it says so ever since i listened to

281
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:01,758
episode

282
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:03,199
576 i've been slowing i've been slowly

283
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,360
listening to all of your previous

284
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,240
episodes while taking copious amounts of

285
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,598
notes

286
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,519
ah man i'm glad you're catching up and

287
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:10,240
learning a lot it says i am growing in a

288
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:13,680
closet

289
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:15,120
with a complete home depot grow kit

290
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,879
and he said that's been acquired by

291
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,000
wandering around home depot looking for

292
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,080
comparable items

293
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,759
to the vast array i see and i

294
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:24,800
implemented while learning about

295
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,319
my wonderful new craft and trade

296
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,840
there are a lot of great things at home

297
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,800
depot that could definitely build you a

298
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:30,959
nice grow

299
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,719
i'm sure you've got a good start i was

300
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:34,240
at home depot looking for lighting for

301
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,440
this new area there's a new ceiling

302
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,038
light up here you probably can't tell

303
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,200
because these lights are overpowering

304
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:40,080
i got a new led ceiling like that [ __ ]

305
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,640
is bright

306
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,639
when i was there i saw this big square

307
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:46,080
led light panel and i thought

308
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:47,919
that would be an amazing grow light for

309
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,480
somebody who had to be stealth like

310
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:52,240
so there are things at home depot at

311
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,440
lowe's at your local hardware shop that

312
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,278
will definitely

313
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,040
get you through a growth build yourself

314
00:08:55,278 --> 00:08:59,039
a nice little macgyver grow space just

315
00:08:57,039 --> 00:09:00,958
like our veteran friend here is doing

316
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:02,719
it says i do have a grow question that

317
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:03,599
has eluded me all right i look forward

318
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,680
to this one

319
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,200
it says knowing that our beautiful divas

320
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:08,639
can tolerate higher temperatures when

321
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,399
implementing co2

322
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:11,919
my question is why push these higher

323
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,720
temps when i've also come across the

324
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:15,679
information

325
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,800
that higher temperatures also destroy

326
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:19,278
the terps

327
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:19,919
so yes that is accurate when we are

328
00:09:19,278 --> 00:09:22,240
running

329
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:24,639
high amounts of co2 in a grow room we

330
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:27,759
can also run higher temperatures

331
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:29,600
it's not necessary but you can do it uh

332
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:32,399
generally i'll keep the grow in the low

333
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,360
80s high 70s low 80s and flowering

334
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,278
usually 79

335
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,879
84 that's kind of where i want to be

336
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:39,039
don't go any higher than 84.

337
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:40,639
like i try to say about 77 82 but i mean

338
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:42,079
84 because it's summertime in colorado

339
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:43,519
it gets hot sometimes

340
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,278
so i try not to go any hotter than that

341
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:48,240
if you're running a lot of co2

342
00:09:45,278 --> 00:09:49,519
you can go 87 88 degrees maybe a little

343
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,000
higher i don't like to go too much

344
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,240
higher than

345
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,039
that when you're running co2 the plants

346
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,240
won't react

347
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:56,639
too poorly to that but you do have that

348
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,120
risk

349
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:00,799
of burning off the terps now the reason

350
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,839
most people are running

351
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:05,039
the heat a little bit higher with the

352
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:07,920
co2 is because they can't

353
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:09,919
cool the room efficiently and instead of

354
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:11,919
investing in more cooling equipment

355
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:13,039
they got co2 that is quite often the

356
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:14,479
case not always

357
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:16,000
but that is a way if you've got a little

358
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,120
bit too much heat you can't get it down

359
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,399
that couple of degrees

360
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,519
you can't plug in another air

361
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,120
conditioner you can't get more

362
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,278
ventilation you're struggling with

363
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,360
two three maybe four more degrees spend

364
00:10:23,278 --> 00:10:26,720
the money on co2 you get bigger better

365
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,680
faster growth and you don't have to

366
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,399
battle the heat

367
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:32,078
so it's not always the perfect solution

368
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,839
to have the high temp in the co2

369
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:35,838
sometimes it's just circumstance and it

370
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,360
is what was done sometimes it was the

371
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,480
easiest solution sometimes it was the

372
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,039
cheapest solution

373
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:43,200
sometimes it was the only solution so

374
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:45,278
you were correct in all of the above

375
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,278
things that we can go higher temps

376
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:48,399
with higher co2 and you were also

377
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:50,879
correct in thinking

378
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,000
that higher temperatures do volatize our

379
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:54,799
terpenes

380
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,559
um i think i don't think that the

381
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:59,120
temperatures we are getting

382
00:10:56,559 --> 00:11:00,719
the differential between no co2 and co2

383
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,759
temperature grow rooms are enough to

384
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,079
destroy

385
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:05,360
too many terps it's just a few degrees

386
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:06,958
you're getting up to like

387
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,879
i don't even want to say 90 degrees that

388
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:11,039
that's gonna start [ __ ] with terps

389
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:12,799
but a lot of what we're talking about i

390
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:14,639
think comes from the old school grow

391
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:16,399
world like i said this came from when we

392
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:18,078
couldn't add another air conditioner or

393
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,600
maybe the black market grow world or the

394
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:20,958
underground grow world or the free

395
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,519
market grow world whatever you want to

396
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:23,199
call it

397
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,320
the non-regulated grow world where

398
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,000
people had to be a little bit more

399
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,480
secretive a little bit more quiet about

400
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,399
it

401
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:33,120
so it wasn't always ideal to

402
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,639
run the co2 without the air conditioner

403
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,039
but it wasn't there wasn't another

404
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:37,278
option

405
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:38,480
also the reason i brought up old school

406
00:11:37,278 --> 00:11:40,559
and back in the day

407
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,000
because we probably didn't know as much

408
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:43,759
about terps then we didn't know

409
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,039
we were cooking the terps off so we just

410
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:46,480
thought it's

411
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:48,319
[ __ ] cool enough to let the plants

412
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,800
grow they're happening so let's just let

413
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,399
it grow

414
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:53,838
so they were probably just using the co2

415
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:55,120
because they couldn't cool the room and

416
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,360
it was the option

417
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,200
uh i don't know that that heat is going

418
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,000
to be enough to disrupt and destroy the

419
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,320
terps

420
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,440
and also we didn't know about terps at

421
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,959
that time so

422
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,639
that's why we weren't too worried about

423
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:08,719
the terpenes serpents are kind of

424
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,320
for a little while there uh terpenes

425
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,000
were just the word of the day

426
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,079
phenotype was the word of the day for a

427
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,600
little while uh terps will go away and

428
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:16,319
it's gonna be something new it was cbd

429
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,519
for a minute

430
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,360
so now that terps have been the hot

431
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,000
thing we've all learned about terps and

432
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,159
that's why

433
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,600
we're more concerned more educated and

434
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:25,120
more worried about terps now we try not

435
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,959
to get the room so hot hopefully

436
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,320
but i think part of it was because we

437
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:30,159
couldn't add more air conditioning

438
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,278
because we were in a black market grow

439
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:33,199
and i think another part of it is

440
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:35,439
because we simply were not educated

441
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,200
on terpenes and the volatility of

442
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,639
terpenes so i want to continue there's

443
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,278
more it says lastly

444
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:43,120
in episode 581 you broached the issue of

445
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:45,600
somehow being able to verify

446
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,039
if somebody is truly a veteran i'm not

447
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,920
sure if you're able to incorporate the

448
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:50,799
services

449
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:51,120
but omaha stakes had a surface a service

450
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:53,759
called

451
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,399
id me where veterans are able to contr

452
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:57,759
confirm

453
00:12:54,399 --> 00:13:00,440
their veteran status also most veterans

454
00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:02,078
could share a redacted copy of their

455
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:05,200
dd213 form

456
00:13:02,078 --> 00:13:07,199
i would gladly share my unredacted dd213

457
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,480
for some growers love hey i trust you

458
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,879
and respect you and believe you my

459
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,159
friend

460
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:11,278
uh you're not trying to get one over on

461
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:12,958
me you're not trying to get anything

462
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:13,759
from me you actually give to me on

463
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:16,159
patreon

464
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:17,679
so i believe you fully trust in you i

465
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:19,838
believe that you are a veteran

466
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:21,679
that is great advice great information

467
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:24,240
we may use that in the future

468
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:26,319
i think when my veteran friend keith

469
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,839
talks to vets he can tell

470
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,000
it's just like when a surfer talks to a

471
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,519
surfer a grower talks to a grower a

472
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,519
drummer talks to a drummer

473
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:36,000
some stuff you just can't fake so i

474
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,759
think uh we will catch on eventually

475
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,440
and if not if somebody needs to lie to

476
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:41,198
us that [ __ ] bad to get a light and

477
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,120
they're gonna say they're a veteran and

478
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:44,479
be that shitty of a person we'll give

479
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,919
them a light maybe they'll still grow

480
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,959
and they still get to be a shitty person

481
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:48,319
inside and know it

482
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:50,719
maybe they can grow and grow out of

483
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,320
being a shitty person but i do trust you

484
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,160
i believe you and this is a good way

485
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,519
to vet people and we can we can throw

486
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:58,078
this out there if we need to

487
00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:00,000
it goes on to say uh please give up a

488
00:13:58,078 --> 00:14:01,278
personal shout out dab and a fist bump

489
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,679
and especially

490
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:04,879
an especially resinous hand salute to

491
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:08,078
all of the military

492
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:10,320
veterans and their family members

493
00:14:08,078 --> 00:14:11,759
yes this is veterans day as i record now

494
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,879
so let's send up a big

495
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:17,759
high five a fist bump a resinous

496
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:18,320
sticky handshake and a big fat bong rip

497
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:20,958
a fat

498
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,480
joint and a big old dab of freedom for

499
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:22,958

536
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:23,838
wanted to mention that maybe you should

537
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,240
brighten up your background with your

538
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,600
new studio a little bit um

539
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,198
i'm still learning the lighting i'm

540
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,839
learning a couple of things we'll get it

541
00:15:29,198 --> 00:15:31,919
dialed in

542
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,360
i may put some plants right here and

543
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:34,078
here or something i may leave it

544
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,199
spacious

545
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:36,719
i don't know if you've noticed i got

546
00:15:35,198 --> 00:15:38,639
little mini roster jeff on the desk

547
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,639
today hanging out with us

548
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,639
trying to decorate without clutter but

549
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,079
thank you for the feedback

550
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:45,519
let's keep going because i am getting

551
00:15:44,078 --> 00:15:47,039
rambly from that dab it feels like it's

552
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,519
still kicking in

553
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:50,159
it says my question is i have a couple

554
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,320
of male

555
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:53,278
arise plants leaving their vegetative

556
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,440
stage that

557
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:57,120
just passed some rigorous testing and i

558
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,360
know i need to wait for this stem

559
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,039
rub smells so where is your number one

560
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:04,240
favorite spot on the plant

561
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:05,599
to get a good stem rub smell

562
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,440
and then he follows it up with this big

563
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,480
old question and what are your top

564
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:13,680
five traits you use to select males

565
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,800
both for flavor and for structure peace

566
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:16,958
love and

567
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:18,399
respect that's a great question let's

568
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:20,239
start with the very first one

569
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,320
so when we're trying to predict what a

570
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,560
plant is going to smell like in

571
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,519
the vegetative stage it is very common

572
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:28,638
just to give that

573
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:30,159
stem a rub now keep in mind that stem

574
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,519
rub is not going to tell you what the

575
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:33,759
plants are going to smell like

576
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:35,120
in flower in the finished stage it's

577
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,879
going to give you a good hint of some of

578
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,879
the aromas available

579
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:39,919
i know what i'm looking for in veg i

580
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:42,240
know what those veg

581
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:44,319
flavors translate to and convert to

582
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,560
later down the line in flour

583
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,519
i like a male plant that kind of smells

584
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:49,599
like puke

585
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,560
i know that sounds disgusting but the

586
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,600
male plants

587
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:54,399
that have a mothball and vomit sort of

588
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,879
aroma

589
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:58,159
always put out amazing terpenes once

590
00:16:56,879 --> 00:17:00,720
they pollinate something

591
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:01,519
and that stuff flowers that's like a

592
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,480
very good

593
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:06,400
starting ingredient balls and puke it

594
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,919
may sound disgusting to you now

595
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,480
but when you get some cannabis that

596
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,959
smells and or tastes like mothballs and

597
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,160
puke

598
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:14,000
you're going to be ecstatic you're going

599
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,480
to love the flavor the aromas are going

600
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,240
to be

601
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,558
tremendous and thick and heavy and the

602
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,720
buzz will be delightful so

603
00:17:18,558 --> 00:17:22,160
that is something i really enjoy is the

604
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,038
vomit mothball

605
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,079
sort of a bar trash can fermented funk

606
00:17:25,038 --> 00:17:28,640
sort of an aroma

607
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:30,000
i like that in a male stem rub when and

608
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,240
where do i rub

609
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,519
rub everywhere and rub often i get in

610
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,839
there and violate

611
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:36,960
that bitch's space that's my plant i can

612
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:39,279
touch wherever i want

613
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,240
i start down low give it a little rub

614
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:41,678
smell the fingers

615
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,359
use another hand give it another rub in

616
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,640
another spot smell your fingers

617
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:46,159
rub your hands on your pants and act

618
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,799
like you're getting that all that smell

619
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,320
away

620
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:50,000
smell them again see if they smell like

621
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:51,359
pants then [ __ ] rub that stem

622
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,359
somewhere else and give it a smell

623
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:55,519
i get all over that [ __ ] plant she's

624
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:56,399
mine i grew it i bred it i can violate

625
00:17:55,519 --> 00:17:58,160
the [ __ ] out of it

626
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,679
i get in there and touch it all over the

627
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,120
place to see what it smells like

628
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,480
sometimes i'll pull off a big leaf and

629
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:03,038
just squish that leaf around in my

630
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,960
fingers

631
00:18:03,038 --> 00:18:06,319
see what kind of smells i get there i

632
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,519
like to get in there and smell the [ __ ]

633
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:09,759
out of them so

634
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:10,558
ah all over the place for stem rubs dude

635
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:13,038
start low

636
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:14,639
go up higher smell the leaves smell that

637
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:16,240
[ __ ] smell the essence of that plant

638
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,400
that's your baby girl get in there

639
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,440
and enjoy it the best you can now let's

640
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,160
talk about

641
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,679
five traits that i may look for when

642
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,120
selecting a male plant that's a very

643
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:26,960
good question to ask a breeder

644
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:29,119
with a very prolific male plant who's

645
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,558
been uh becoming very popular lately in

646
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:32,399
the breeding scene

647
00:18:30,558 --> 00:18:34,319
things that i look for when it comes to

648
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:37,120
breeding from a male

649
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:38,798
vigor i don't want some slow shitty

650
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:41,038
wispy growing plant when i plant those

651
00:18:38,798 --> 00:18:44,240
plants i want to watch that seedling go

652
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:46,000
i do not want the most vigorous fastest

653
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,160
growing plant that is usually

654
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,839
that one is too much male it's going to

655
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,880
have too much male dominance in the

656
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:52,879
cross it's like

657
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,000
if you just took this one male and

658
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,520
crossed it to anything

659
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,119
everything else you cross it to is going

660
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:58,639
to come out like that male you're going

661
00:18:57,119 --> 00:18:59,359
to make a bunch of outcrosses that are

662
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,960
that male

663
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:02,719
the idea is to find a male that

664
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,480
complements all of the females you cross

665
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,480
it to so i don't want that first

666
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,839
tall male but i want one that's got a

667
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,000
lot of vigor to it

668
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:11,918
nice good growth not just not the run

669
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,440
not the slow wispy shitty one

670
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,120
not the one we're all waiting on we

671
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,798
don't want that one i want a good

672
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:18,399
vigorous plant so that's number one

673
00:19:16,798 --> 00:19:20,960
vigor then i look for

674
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,480
shape and structure what is the shape of

675
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,960
the plant what is the structure of the

676
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,038
plant

677
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,038
can the branches hold themselves up does

678
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:29,038
it make a big thick stock and nice

679
00:19:27,038 --> 00:19:30,400
robust branches or does it make a wispy

680
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:31,759
shitty middle stock and then try to

681
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,320
branch out real crazy

682
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:35,919
does it branch evenly does it honestly

683
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:37,119
you've got to have your goal in mind

684
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,400
that's something i've got written down

685
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:40,399
here toward the end but

686
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,400
the shape and structure are all about

687
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,679
your goal if you want a plant

688
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,200
that you're going to be able to scrog

689
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,798
out real well you might want one that

690
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,558
you could top and makes a lot of nice

691
00:19:46,798 --> 00:19:49,918
branching that are all the same length

692
00:19:48,558 --> 00:19:52,000
if you're the kind of guy that doesn't

693
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,960
do scrogging and you do the trees with

694
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,960
the pole in the middle

695
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,640
with a mono cropping with a monopole

696
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,919
maybe you want those sativa style plants

697
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,320
to grow long and skinny

698
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:01,120
and just long skinny branches up the top

699
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:02,879
maybe

700
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:05,439
maybe you want a short squatty indica

701
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,480
plant that's all about your goal

702
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,840
that's like if you want to make

703
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,120
chocolate you got to put some chocolate

704
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:10,558
in there if you want to make some

705
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:12,079
something else i'm not a cook so i don't

706
00:20:10,558 --> 00:20:13,279
even know where to go with this but if

707
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:14,798
you want chocolate in it you got to have

708
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:16,558
chocolate in the mix if you want vanilla

709
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:18,480
in it you got to have vanilla in the mix

710
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:20,480
that's just how the male plant works so

711
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,679
you need vigor you need a good structure

712
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,440
and a good shape

713
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:25,840
the structure and the shape are going to

714
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,759
be a lot of what goes into your

715
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:29,759
your offspring so get a good structure

716
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:31,839
and a good shape look at leaf size

717
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:33,440
that's going to tell you a lot also i

718
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:35,279
also look for aroma

719
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,279
i mentioned that i like that bar trash

720
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:39,440
can mothballs dirty feet

721
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:40,399
all kinds of funky disgustingness i like

722
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,640
those aromas

723
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:45,360
that always translates into a good

724
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:48,000
stinky offspring the progeny will smell

725
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:48,879
gross and good you'll get that funky

726
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,119
mothball

727
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,919
puke aroma with whatever you're crossing

728
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:54,239
it with so

729
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:55,038
my arisemail has like a funky cushy

730
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,720
sweetness

731
00:20:55,038 --> 00:20:58,079
when you rub the stem it's like sweet

732
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,679
vomit it's like somebody had too much

733
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:01,119
cheesecake and beer and threw up that's

734
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:02,480
really what it smells like to me

735
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:04,399
it's [ __ ] delicious strawberry

736
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,839
cheesecake and vomit give it

737
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,360
maybe bubble gum in there give it a

738
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:08,158
little smell you're like that's [ __ ]

739
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:09,599
disgusting

740
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:11,039
then you cross it with a plant like

741
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:12,079
platinum tangy which smells like just

742
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:13,919
straight oranges

743
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:15,439
and it comes off like gassy oranges and

744
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:18,080
it's so beautiful so

745
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,600
i like that flavor and aroma another

746
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:21,918
thing i really look for when i'm picking

747
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:23,918
male plants is flowering time

748
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:25,759
a lot of people don't grow a male plant

749
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:27,440
out past two or three weeks because they

750
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:27,839
go into panic mode and got to get rid of

751
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,679
it

752
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:31,678
even some breeders never get to see

753
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:33,840
their male plants past week four

754
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:36,080
i've posted pictures i've got pictures

755
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:37,918
of several male plants in rooms

756
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:39,119
that are past weeks nine and ten maybe

757
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,960
into week 11.

758
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:42,558
i really like to see what these plants

759
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,319
do i need to know

760
00:21:42,558 --> 00:21:46,158
how long it takes them to get into full

761
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:47,519
flower how long are they going to

762
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:49,200
continue to flower

763
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:51,038
what do they look like if you flower

764
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,960
them for a really long time

765
00:21:51,038 --> 00:21:54,480
if i let them go for a long time do i

766
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,159
see any problems

767
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,159
i want them to flower out i want them to

768
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,039
produce pollen i want to keep the leaves

769
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:00,880
nice and healthy

770
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:03,038
all the way through their life do those

771
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:05,600
male plants here's another thing

772
00:22:03,038 --> 00:22:06,798
are they uh susceptible or resistant to

773
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:08,558
bugs and mildew

774
00:22:06,798 --> 00:22:10,158
if i've got powdery mildew or spider

775
00:22:08,558 --> 00:22:11,038
mites in one area i'll take that male

776
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:12,960
plant over there

777
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:15,200
and see how that male plant reacts to

778
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,240
those things i've got to abuse my male

779
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:20,000
plants so

780
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:22,319
uh vigor structure aroma flower time

781
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,759
i don't want the first males to flower

782
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:25,519
and show me that they're males

783
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:27,519
that one that's super hyper vigorous

784
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:29,599
hyper dominant hyper ready to just be

785
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:31,679
like i'm a boy let's pollinate [ __ ]

786
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:33,599
he's a little bit too dominant i don't

787
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:35,120
want that much testosterone in my mix

788
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:36,798
he's just gonna make everybody else just

789
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:37,599
a bunch of meatheads he's gonna dominate

790
00:22:36,798 --> 00:22:39,839
the mix

791
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:42,000
not what i need so i want the one if i

792
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:44,000
add if i have 10 seeds i talk about this

793
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,599
a lot if i have 10 seeds

794
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,359
hypothetically 10 regular seeds

795
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:48,558
hypothetically five will be males five

796
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:49,359
will be girls let's get rid of those

797
00:22:48,558 --> 00:22:50,798
five girls

798
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:52,719
they can go to your garden you get the

799
00:22:50,798 --> 00:22:54,558
girls i'll grow the boys this time

800
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,640
that first plant that shows me it's a

801
00:22:54,558 --> 00:22:57,839
male will probably get cold because he's

802
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,759
got too much male

803
00:22:57,839 --> 00:23:01,918
energy to the grow i don't want him in

804
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:02,400
there spreading all that male gene back

805
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,240
in there

806
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,840
i want to make a new hybrid not just

807
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:08,000
reproductions of this male

808
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:09,279
so we get rid of that first guy second

809
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,798
guy might get a chance

810
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:12,720
that third and fourth guy is usually

811
00:23:10,798 --> 00:23:15,119
where i go the fifth one is slow

812
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:17,120
he's lagging he gets cold two three and

813
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:17,918
four are the candidates usually number

814
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:20,399
three and four

815
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:22,159
are the ones i choose i've got a good

816
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,120
track record for choosing males so i

817
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:25,039
think i've got a good

818
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:26,239
criteria and scenario for picking my

819
00:23:25,038 --> 00:23:28,240
boys so

820
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,759
i don't want the one that is too too

821
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,558
vigorous right out of the gate but i

822
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:32,240
want one that

823
00:23:30,558 --> 00:23:34,000
goes into flour and starts producing

824
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,558
pollen at a reasonable time

825
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,400
around day 21 25 i want to get a lot of

826
00:23:36,558 --> 00:23:39,359
pollen coming out around day 32 i really

827
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,360
want him going

828
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:42,639
then i want to see how he goes how long

829
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:44,399
until he reaches that full

830
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,559
flower then how long until he stops

831
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,880
producing pollen as a breeder making a

832
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:51,839
lot of seeds that's very important to me

833
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,799
now another thing i really like to find

834
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:55,599
in a male plant

835
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:57,359
is trichomes if i see trichome and resin

836
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:58,079
development on a male plant early in

837
00:23:57,359 --> 00:24:00,158
flower

838
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:01,359
that is a breeding candidate that means

839
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:03,360
it is going to pass

840
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:04,959
trichomes onto the females the females

841
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:06,399
naturally make trichomes if your males

842
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,720
are making trichomes too

843
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,400
you got two ingredients with trichomes

844
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,360
lots of trichome production is what that

845
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,759
means to me

846
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:15,278
more trichomes more cannabinoids more

847
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:16,640
cannabinoids a better buzz more

848
00:24:15,278 --> 00:24:18,480
desirable product

849
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,320
that's what you're going for so if it's

850
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,839
got trichomes on it you want to breed

851
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:23,599
with it i know i've gone past

852
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:24,959
five by now but let's keep talking

853
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:27,119
something else i really like

854
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,400
is a good color everybody's growing

855
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:30,079
they're posting pictures

856
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,919
if a good color comes out of my male

857
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:32,960
plants that is a bonus if i can get some

858
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:35,038
nice fall

859
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,798
wintery colors in there that is a great

860
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:37,679
thing some oranges some purple some dark

861
00:24:36,798 --> 00:24:39,278
colored hues

862
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:41,360
that's something that is always a bonus

863
00:24:39,278 --> 00:24:42,720
i've seen purple trichomes come out of

864
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:44,558
male plants i've seen male plants

865
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,558
produce purple male flowers

866
00:24:44,558 --> 00:24:48,399
i've seen a lot of great [ __ ] so get in

867
00:24:46,558 --> 00:24:48,960
there and breed use a bunch of male

868
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,278
plants

869
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,079
grow them see what you like then the

870
00:24:51,278 --> 00:24:55,200
best way

871
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:56,158
the only real way to test those males is

872
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,159
to germinate

873
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:59,600
and grow the seeds you have made there

874
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:00,559
are a few things to test when you get to

875
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:03,119
that point

876
00:25:00,558 --> 00:25:05,119
how well do those seeds germinate put

877
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:06,639
however many if you made 100 seeds maybe

878
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:08,239
germinate 10 of them and just see how

879
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,600
with intentions not even to grow them

880
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,278
this is just a germ test

881
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:13,278
throw 10 of them however you normally

882
00:25:11,278 --> 00:25:14,880
germinate i do the paper towel method

883
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:17,200
throw ten in the paper towel germinate

884
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:19,278
them count them if you got seven of them

885
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,759
seventy percent germination rate that's

886
00:25:19,278 --> 00:25:23,200
not super good 80 is good 90 is the best

887
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:25,200
100 you're [ __ ] killing it

888
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,200
but i guess 100 is the best 90 is

889
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,519
[ __ ] way acceptable

890
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,960
see how many germinate see how many duds

891
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:32,319
you have then grow them out

892
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,079
i just said you don't have intentions to

893
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:35,678
grow this let's [ __ ] grow it maybe we

894
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:37,439
change our mind let's grow these out

895
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:38,960
then let's see if there are any

896
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,159
hermaphrodites let's see if there are

897
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,440
any mutants let's see if there are any

898
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:42,960
[ __ ] weirdos

899
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,640
let's see if they even make it to the

900
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,880
veg stage maybe they just die out and

901
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,799
turn into duds before they get that far

902
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,400
then let's see if they're hermaphrodites

903
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:51,839
let's see if they show intersex traits

904
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,120
maybe you've got the next [ __ ] chem

905
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:54,079
dog in there maybe you've got the new

906
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:55,359
golden goat

907
00:25:54,079 --> 00:25:56,558
maybe you just bred the new [ __ ]

908
00:25:55,359 --> 00:25:58,158
skittles in there we don't know what

909
00:25:56,558 --> 00:26:00,000
you've got until you grow it

910
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:01,360
now grow it in perfect conditions and

911
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,960
see what you come up with

912
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:04,719
if it does well in perfect conditions

913
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,880
our next step is to take it to a [ __ ]

914
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:09,440
up grow room and grow it in there

915
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,400
everybody has a friend who always gets a

916
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,320
certain problem

917
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:14,080
we all know that that one guy always has

918
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:15,918
powdery mildew i know that one grow over

919
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:16,558
there always has spider mites this one

920
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:18,559
dude

921
00:26:16,558 --> 00:26:20,079
always gets thrips let's take these

922
00:26:18,558 --> 00:26:20,798
plants to a couple of those places and

923
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:22,319
find out

924
00:26:20,798 --> 00:26:24,000
what happens when we put them in a room

925
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:25,278
with thrips what happens when we put

926
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,480
them near powdery mildew

927
00:26:25,278 --> 00:26:28,319
what happens when we treat them too hot

928
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,599
and too cold how do they reply to that

929
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:31,519
how do they react

930
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:32,959
if your plants freak out right away that

931
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:34,960
is not something for a market but it may

932
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:37,600
be something you want to grow yourself

933
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,079
so those are the ways that i check and

934
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:40,079
audition

935
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:41,439
and select male plants for breeding i

936
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:42,879
base it off of vigor

937
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,720
i base it off of the shape and the

938
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,360
structure of the plant i check out the

939
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,880
aromas

940
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:48,798
they come from that plant i give it stem

941
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,600
rubs i smell the flowers i let it flower

942
00:26:48,798 --> 00:26:50,960
out

943
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:52,719
then i pay attention to how long it

944
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,840
takes to flower how much pollen it

945
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,400
produces for me

946
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:58,959
then i look for trichomes and colors and

947
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,720
just anything else that may stand out

948
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,640
being a breeder and a grower that has

949
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,319
had access to a lot of rooms

950
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,159
a lot of plants like when i work in

951
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:08,240
commercial facilities my numbers

952
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:09,679
to grow are much expanded compared to a

953
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,359
lot of other people's numbers

954
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:13,360
so i've gotten to see a lot of male

955
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:14,479
plants and that makes it much easier for

956
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:17,038
me to select

957
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,519
if you've only got 10 one may not stand

958
00:27:17,038 --> 00:27:19,440
out

959
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:21,440
if you've got a hundred one of them is

960
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,080
gonna say i am the bad [ __ ] in

961
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,278
this group

962
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:25,199
i don't know what you've got to work

963
00:27:23,278 --> 00:27:27,038
with but you really start seeing more

964
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,960
uh more opportunities more standouts

965
00:27:27,038 --> 00:27:30,480
when you work with larger populations

966
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,079
those outliers are more obvious they

967
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,038
become more present more available when

968
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:34,558
you work with a lot

969
00:27:33,038 --> 00:27:36,398
so i've got a lot of experience picking

970
00:27:34,558 --> 00:27:38,000
boys and like i said before i feel like

971
00:27:36,398 --> 00:27:40,639
i've got a pretty good track record

972
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,640
at picking male plants for breeding so

973
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:44,080
again it is all about your goal

974
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,360
what do you want to do do you want

975
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:46,480
plants that are short and squat and

976
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:48,000
smell like oranges

977
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,360
you may want to find a short squatty

978
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
male and a female that smells like

979
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:51,678
oranges

980
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,519
do you want plants that are tall and

981
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:55,278
lanky and smell like strawberries maybe

982
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:56,720
find a tall lanky meal plant and a girl

983
00:27:55,278 --> 00:27:59,839
that smells like strawberries

984
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,240
it's all about your overall goal most of

985
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:02,959
all

986
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,679
have fun uh grow from your heart breed

987
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,759
with love

988
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:08,000
and make sure uh that you test

989
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:09,038
everything before you give it to anybody

990
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,798
but if you're just growing it for

991
00:28:09,038 --> 00:28:11,440
yourself have fun man make a bunch of

992
00:28:10,798 --> 00:28:13,200
seeds

993
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,480
grow the [ __ ] out of them take a lot of

994
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,679
notes and enjoy it

995
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,440
