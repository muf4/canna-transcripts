too much time let's jump into the main

65
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,259
topic of today's podcast at the top of

66
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:37,378
the show I did say that I was going to

67
00:02:34,259 --> 00:02:39,479
focus on patreon questions recently I

68
00:02:37,378 --> 00:02:41,639
posted to patreon that I was going to

69
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:44,939
eat too many Edibles and do a patreon

70
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:46,619
only episode where I answered a non-grow

71
00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:49,139
questions maybe grow questions about

72
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:50,939
myself about my personal life maybe the

73
00:02:49,139 --> 00:02:52,979
music I'm into maybe some of my past or

74
00:02:50,939 --> 00:02:55,378
my history I opened it up so that the

75
00:02:52,979 --> 00:02:57,359
patrons can ask any questions they felt

76
00:02:55,378 --> 00:02:59,818
comfortable asking something I don't

77
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,200
want to do is do a patreon episode where

78
00:02:59,818 --> 00:03:02,878
I answer a bunch of great grow questions

79
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:05,339
questions and leave people out I want

80
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:07,739
that knowledge free and available to

81
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:10,680
everybody so when I do patreon bonus

82
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:12,959
content it is going to be uh non-grow

83
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,700
related content kind of fun content kind

84
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,439
of ways to just hang out with the crowd

85
00:03:14,699 --> 00:03:18,299
and give them extra content that doesn't

86
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:20,519
exclude Growers I think you get my point

87
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:22,379
so I did ask for questions that were not

88
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:24,658
grow related and I did say I was going

89
00:03:22,378 --> 00:03:26,340
to eat a bunch of Edibles allegedly

90
00:03:24,658 --> 00:03:28,378
possibly I may have eaten those Edibles

91
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:30,360
before this podcast we're gonna do this

92
00:03:28,378 --> 00:03:31,919
normal show see how long it takes those

93
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,599
to kick in then we will take a break

94
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:36,059
then of course we will shift to the

95
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:37,619
patreon only format so let's jump into

96
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:40,199
this first question here while things

97
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:42,480
start doing their magic this one goes a

98
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:44,518
little bit maybe a lot like this it says

99
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:47,158
yo Ross to Jeff and it go it comes from

100
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:49,680
my friend gruesome green on patreon big

101
00:03:47,158 --> 00:03:51,239
up to gruesome green on patreon it says

102
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,420
Ross the Jeff would you ever consider

103
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:56,580
being a sponsor for a band and that is a

104
00:03:54,419 --> 00:03:59,759
really good question also really good

105
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:01,500
ironic timing uh Saturday night I'm

106
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:03,000
recording on what's the date right now

107
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,699
do we have to be specific I'm recording

108
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,400
on September 28th uh Saturday night I

109
00:04:05,699 --> 00:04:10,318
got to go see the lovely Natalie rise

110
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,299
perform at a club here in my hometown

111
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:14,339
she played at Brews Ale House in Pueblo

112
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:16,199
Colorado I got to take the lovely Miss

113
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:18,540
irie with me you also known her as dread

114
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:20,280
Vibes you also know her as Zara that is

115
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:22,919
Miss irie I took her with me we got to

116
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:25,079
go see Natalie rise minori opened the

117
00:04:22,918 --> 00:04:27,839
show it was a wonderful an amazing

118
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:29,698
concert Natalie rice did a great job but

119
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:32,219
Nori did a great job I love the Rhythm

120
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:33,900
Section and Natalie rise's band but my

121
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:36,600
point is what you asked about is sponsor

122
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:40,019
the band ironically we worked out a

123
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:41,879
sponsorship deal with that band so the

124
00:04:40,019 --> 00:04:44,579
next leg of the Natalie rise tour will

125
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:45,959
be brought to you by irie genetics I

126
00:04:44,579 --> 00:04:48,060
can't talk too much about what that does

127
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:50,339
include but I am sponsoring that band

128
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:51,600
and they are not the first reggae band

129
00:04:50,339 --> 00:04:54,478
which I have sponsored I have

130
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,220
contributed funding to tours and uh

131
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:58,199
recording mixing and mastering for other

132
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:00,479
reggae bands that I'm not sure if they

133
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:02,460
want me to say who they are and are or

134
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:05,879
not I can't say that I've done some work

135
00:05:02,459 --> 00:05:08,579
with jamiri Morgan and I can maybe hint

136
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:11,339
and lead on that there may be a strain

137
00:05:08,579 --> 00:05:13,379
being put together for jamery Morgan

138
00:05:11,339 --> 00:05:15,719
with his flavor profile and some things

139
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:17,639
that he selected maybe doing some stuff

140
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:20,280
for our friend jamiri which may be

141
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:21,960
released here in the near future also

142
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:24,418
allegedly may be working on something

143
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:26,159
with Miss Natalie rice so the question

144
00:05:24,418 --> 00:05:28,799
is would I consider being a sponsor for

145
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,960
a band Yes I love sponsoring bands when

146
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,520
I was younger and we're going to talk

147
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:34,258
about this more in these episodes these

148
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:36,839
personal roster Jeff episodes when I was

149
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:38,639
younger my original dream was to be a

150
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:40,560
rock star I'm a drummer I got drums for

151
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,478
my 14th birthday I've been playing

152
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,038
non-stop since then I never give it a

153
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:46,860
rest I never quit thinking about poly

154
00:05:44,038 --> 00:05:49,079
rhythms and paradiddles and 12 16-0

155
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:50,400
triplets in 12-8 time and just weird

156
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:52,620
[ __ ] I'm always thinking about the drums

157
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:54,899
you guys so when I was younger my dream

158
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:57,720
was to travel and be a musician I got to

159
00:05:54,899 --> 00:05:59,459
do it on a small level we didn't have I

160
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,020
wasn't successful I mean I had fun if

161
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:02,879
success is traveling around and having

162
00:06:01,019 --> 00:06:04,500
fun with your friends and just partying

163
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:06,060
real hard we did that I didn't really go

164
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,500
anywhere with the opportunity that I had

165
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:09,600
because I was young and I kind of kind

166
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:11,160
of squandered that but my dream was to

167
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,280
play music if I would have had somebody

168
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,720
like myself to say hey here's uh funding

169
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:17,459
here's gas money for the next part of

170
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,199
the tour here's money for drum hats

171
00:06:17,459 --> 00:06:21,478
guitar strings and most importantly food

172
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,280
because a lot of times on the road we

173
00:06:21,478 --> 00:06:25,978
were hungry bro bands would promise you

174
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:27,119
money uh gas money gig money hotel room

175
00:06:25,978 --> 00:06:28,500
and you would get there and you'd have

176
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,538
to sleep in the van and eat peanut

177
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:32,699
butter and jelly sandwiches it was worth

178
00:06:30,538 --> 00:06:34,318
it I wouldn't change any of it but

179
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:36,000
um Ben that did suck if I would have had

180
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,879
somebody back in the day to fund my tour

181
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,800
I may have been more successful in the

182
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:42,600
music industry so that's why I do it I

183
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,400
love the music that the artists that I

184
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,500
promote and endorse and support and

185
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:47,939
sponsor I love their music I love their

186
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,259
Vibe I love what they're about so it

187
00:06:47,939 --> 00:06:51,538
feels good doing that and I get to go

188
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:53,520
see my favorite reggae bands because I

189
00:06:51,538 --> 00:06:55,139
helped contribute to their funding then

190
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:56,758
a lot of other people get to see them as

191
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:57,960
well get treated like a rock star when

192
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:59,879
you go it's a good time all right that's

193
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:02,159
the first part of that question I am

194
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:04,439
rambling maybe the uh the chocolates are

195
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,120
kicking in then there's a part B of this

196
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:09,060
question it says favorite place to visit

197
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:11,459
or vacation in Colorado

198
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:14,000
um we have four seasons here in Colorado

199
00:07:11,459 --> 00:07:17,279
we get spring summer fall and winter

200
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,839
very noticeably different climates uh

201
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:20,038
environments here plus we got a lot of

202
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:22,019
different types of environment here

203
00:07:20,038 --> 00:07:23,639
we've got the desert we've got the

204
00:07:22,019 --> 00:07:25,859
foresty stuff we've got mountainy stuff

205
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:27,300
of course we got ski season we got like

206
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:29,098
Lake season and [ __ ] like that so

207
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:30,660
there's a lot of different things to do

208
00:07:29,098 --> 00:07:33,000
and places to go here in Colorado

209
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:34,919
picking a favorite place to visit and

210
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,860
vacation would be very very hard to do

211
00:07:34,918 --> 00:07:39,598
just one if you're going to come to my

212
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,979
neck of the woods Southern Colorado and

213
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:43,500
want me to show you around I'm taking

214
00:07:40,978 --> 00:07:45,060
you to Bishop Castle I'm taking you like

215
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:47,819
Lake Isabel I'm showing you outside

216
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:49,740
stuff and real Majestic outdoor [ __ ] if

217
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:51,180
we're in Denver and it's nice out we're

218
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:53,280
going to go toward the downtown area

219
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:54,840
especially if it's getting like kind of

220
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:57,059
toward Christmas and it's not snowing

221
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:59,459
downtown Denver is [ __ ] beautiful it

222
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:01,560
looks great uh if it's ski season time

223
00:07:59,459 --> 00:08:03,120
we may go up to a little ski Town

224
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,319
whichever we're closest to they're all

225
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,840
really adorable there's a lot of great

226
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,160
ski towns just kind of depends on what

227
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:10,198
the vibe is what you're looking for

228
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,759
we've got so much great [ __ ] here to

229
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:13,860
offer and it's so seasonal that you kind

230
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,598
of have to take advantage of the season

231
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:17,460
and do what's available at this time of

232
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:19,139
year so depends on when you're coming

233
00:08:17,459 --> 00:08:20,758
where you're trying to go and what the

234
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:22,259
vibe is are you taking a lady out are

235
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:23,939
you showing the Bros night out on the

236
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:25,620
town you trying to escape on your own

237
00:08:23,939 --> 00:08:27,598
that really makes a huge difference here

238
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:29,939
I'm going to say Bishop Castle is a

239
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:31,319
great place to take people meow wolf of

240
00:08:29,939 --> 00:08:33,658

241
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:35,759
people I love Comedy Works I'm a huge

242
00:08:33,658 --> 00:08:37,319
comedy nerd if you're into music you got

243
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:39,299
to go see a concert at Red Rocks but

244
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,620
that's all the cliche [ __ ] then once we

245
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:41,939
do all that then we'll go sneak off to

246
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,740
all the fun stuff that nobody knows

247
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:45,480

248
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:46,860

249
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,600

250
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,039
about it on a podcast because I don't

251
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,959
want to blow up all the spots and

252
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:53,278

00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:54,240
more about my musical past what led me

282
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:56,879
to the drums

283
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,080
I'm not sure exactly what led me to the

284
00:09:56,879 --> 00:09:59,519
drums there's something when I would

285
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,560
listen when I grew up when I was younger

286
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,120
I have some uncles I often talk about

287
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:04,379
rest in peace Bros I love you and my one

288
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,778
uncle Troy is still alive two of my

289
00:10:04,379 --> 00:10:09,720
uncles are gone uh they kind of were my

290
00:10:06,778 --> 00:10:11,580
male role models male influences they

291
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:14,040
listen to a lot of rock music a lot of

292
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:16,139
classic rock a lot of metal uh Metallica

293
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:17,759
was played quite often amongst those

294
00:10:16,139 --> 00:10:19,740
three Metallica was probably the main

295
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:20,819
commonality in those three uncles their

296
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:22,560
favorites would have been Metallica

297
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:24,360
together collectively

298
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:26,338
just hearing that music I was always

299
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:28,740
just bobbing my head banging my head to

300
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:30,420
the drums and then when I'd go to

301
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:32,339
concerts I'd just catch myself staring

302
00:10:30,419 --> 00:10:33,778
at the drummer and then I fell in love

303
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:35,640
with the band of Metallica I mentioned

304
00:10:33,778 --> 00:10:38,939
Metallica yes when I was younger I was a

305
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:41,338
huge Metallica fan uh so maybe my uncles

306
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:43,019
live music and just feeling the drums

307
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:44,760
and noticing that everybody just without

308
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:46,259
the drums you can't Bob your head right

309
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:48,179
like you could think you can but there

310
00:10:46,259 --> 00:10:50,578
needs to be some drums to Bob your head

311
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:52,019
or dance properly so that's part of why

312
00:10:50,578 --> 00:10:54,059
I filmed the drums fell in love with the

313
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:56,639
drums is probably Metallica I remember

314
00:10:54,059 --> 00:10:57,838
my uncle had a Chevy El Camino if you

315
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:59,939
know what that is big up if you don't

316
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,500
you're better off my uncle had a Chevy

317
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:03,959
El Camino and he took me to a concert

318
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:05,278
and my two uncles smoked a joint in the

319
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:07,799
front of that El Camino and they played

320
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:09,539
The Black Album by Metallica that smoke

321
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:11,578
wafted into the back and I caught a nice

322
00:11:09,539 --> 00:11:13,259
buzz and I heard the Black album on the

323
00:11:11,578 --> 00:11:15,838
way to that concert by the time I got to

324
00:11:13,259 --> 00:11:18,120
the concert I was convinced I was going

325
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,920
to be a [ __ ] drummer that was so

326
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,600
that's a big part of it right there I

327
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:23,338
did playing drums Musical and music

328
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,680
professionally changed how playing music

329
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:27,720
made you feel yes

330
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:29,879
um there's something about knowing the

331
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,440
dirty uh filthy side of the music

332
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:33,179
industry that makes you just kind of not

333
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,440
want to jump into it it's like jumping

334
00:11:33,179 --> 00:11:35,879
into the pool but then finding out

335
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,440
there's [ __ ] alligators in there

336
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:38,939
you're like I want out of this [ __ ] it

337
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,440
was cool until I knew that was all

338
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:41,880
filled with [ __ ] alligators and

339
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:45,000
sharks

340
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:47,159
um it's a lot of fun but you have to be

341
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,200
the right minded person you have to have

342
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:51,059
the right drive you have to have uh just

343
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,800
you have to be a solid strong person I'm

344
00:11:51,059 --> 00:11:55,078
a strong person and I developed

345
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:57,479
Addictions on the road I definitely I

346
00:11:55,078 --> 00:11:59,278
was an alcoholic and I wasn't a specific

347
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:01,440
drug addict I was a whatever the [ __ ]

348
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:03,419
you got tonight drug addict let's do it

349
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,100
all I didn't care there's some drugs I

350
00:12:03,419 --> 00:12:06,659
wouldn't do don't get me wrong but like

351
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,399
we're doing party drugs and [ __ ]

352
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:10,259
music drugs and I would do all of them

353
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,879
if you had them tonight that was what we

354
00:12:10,259 --> 00:12:14,879
were doing tonight was all of whatever

355
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:17,100
you brought to the party so being on the

356
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:18,240
road uh it changed me a lot because

357
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:20,459
there were addictions there were

358
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,860
Temptations but also the music industry

359
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:25,078
is kind of Grody like you're lied to a a

360
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:26,940
lot you're manipulated a lot until

361
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:29,219
you're signed you're struggling you're

362
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:31,140
just struggling to get signed or make it

363
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:32,579
or have some support once you get

364
00:12:31,139 --> 00:12:34,740
support and you get signed then you're

365
00:12:32,578 --> 00:12:36,120
their [ __ ] you're working just you're

366
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:37,079
trying to find someone to work for and

367
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,060
then once you get someone to work for

368
00:12:37,078 --> 00:12:40,679
you're just working for them they give

369
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:42,299
you money but every couple of weeks they

370
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:43,559
want to progress report like how many

371
00:12:42,299 --> 00:12:44,879
shows have you played how many shirts

372
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:46,859

375
00:12:48,179 --> 00:12:51,359
drug habit going how's the van running

376
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:53,339
and it's that's just normal

377
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,899
responsibilities but also we're in a

378
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:57,660
band trying to write music play music

379
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:59,820
and enjoy this without so all of the

380
00:12:57,659 --> 00:13:01,620
logistics playing a club playing at a

381
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:03,180
club all night long or three nights in a

382
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:05,039
row Friday Saturday Sunday or Thursday

383
00:13:03,179 --> 00:13:06,419
Friday Saturday and then going to

384
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:07,919
collect the money from the club owner

385
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:09,599
and they're a total dick about the deal

386
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:11,578
that they wrote you and you've got it in

387
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,680
text message or email or between another

388
00:13:11,578 --> 00:13:15,000
promoter and the promoter says the club

389
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:16,620
should pay you the club says the

390
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,059
promoter is supposed to pay you you just

391
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:19,078
played three nights in a town you don't

392
00:13:18,059 --> 00:13:20,039
know where the [ __ ] you are you don't

393
00:13:19,078 --> 00:13:22,379
have any friends there you don't have

394
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:24,000
any backup and the club just stiffed you

395
00:13:22,379 --> 00:13:25,500
that kind of [ __ ] puts like a salty

396
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,179
flavor in your mouth so once you get

397
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,559
that sort of stuff when you're it sucks

398
00:13:27,179 --> 00:13:29,879
the passion out of it when you thought

399
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:32,879
you were gonna have a hotel room at

400
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:34,379
dinner and gas money and you don't it

401
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:36,958
starts to piss you off and the music

402
00:13:34,379 --> 00:13:38,820
isn't as good and then the four guys in

403
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:40,619
the van you're not as close anymore

404
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:43,320
because you're hungry and you're pissed

405
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:44,940
off and now when he farted in the van

406
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:46,980
before it used to be funny but now that

407
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:48,180
I'm hungry and pissed off when he farted

408
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:49,440
in the van I want to punch him in the

409
00:13:48,179 --> 00:13:51,059
[ __ ] mouth and it just goes that way

410
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,440
and then it builds up and it kind of

411
00:13:51,059 --> 00:13:53,399
sucks the passion out of it honestly for

412
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,540
me you could tell that I'm getting some

413
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,559
weird emotions out of it already I'm

414
00:13:54,539 --> 00:13:57,179
talking about punching somebody in the

415
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:59,399
mouth just hypothetically you guys ain't

416
00:13:57,179 --> 00:14:01,199
gonna hit nobody never did but being in

417
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:02,578
the van and being broke and hungry it

418
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,200
changes your mindset you're like do I

419
00:14:02,578 --> 00:14:06,778
really want to do this I love the music

420
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:08,278
but like I could just go get a job and

421
00:14:06,778 --> 00:14:10,259
it wouldn't be as bad as this is today

422
00:14:08,278 --> 00:14:11,759
and that's only sometimes then there's

423
00:14:10,259 --> 00:14:13,679
the one hour a night when you're on

424
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:14,879
stage and everybody's putting lights on

425
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:15,958
you and taking pictures of you and

426
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:17,939
screaming your name and singing your

427
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:19,259
lyrics that's [ __ ] cool but the work

428
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:21,540
that goes along with that you're either

429
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:22,799
working to get hired or you're hired and

430
00:14:21,539 --> 00:14:24,539
you're somebody's [ __ ] once you you're

431
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:26,699
hired and signed then you're working for

432
00:14:24,539 --> 00:14:28,799
a record company or a promoter and they

433
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:30,720
want a lot you're their [ __ ] and it's a

434
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:33,419
job at that point whatever your band is

435
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,879
went from like uh patreon the rock band

436
00:14:33,419 --> 00:14:38,399
to patreon INC now you got to get

437
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:40,620
insurance licensing taxes it gets way

438
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:42,059
different then I got a job at Guitar

439
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:43,740
Center because with all my musical

440
00:14:42,059 --> 00:14:45,719
knowledge and abilities I was like I

441
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:47,879
could definitely work at Guitar Center

442
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,800
dude I've been working at Guitar Center

443
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:51,419
for an eight hour shift and when you get

444
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:52,799
in the car most people when you get in

445
00:14:51,419 --> 00:14:54,838
the car after work you crank up some

446
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:56,759
music and drive fast right I would

447
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:58,500
[ __ ] turn down the music I didn't

448
00:14:56,759 --> 00:15:01,019
want to hear anything after working at

449
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:03,179
Guitar Center all day you would I could

450
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:06,419
hear the guitar Department playing Enter

451
00:15:03,179 --> 00:15:09,239
Sandman AC DC [ __ ] back in black or

452
00:15:06,419 --> 00:15:11,698
Welcome to the Jungle or uh walk by

453
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:14,759
Pantera all day long it'd be the same

454
00:15:11,698 --> 00:15:16,740
five songs all freaking day long

455
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:18,059
um [ __ ] what's one the Crazy Train

456
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:20,039
you hear Crazy Train all the [ __ ]

457
00:15:18,059 --> 00:15:21,838
time in Guitar Center or just some basic

458
00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:22,860
blues solo from everybody in there they

459
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,600
all think that they're coolest they

460
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:26,039
never played it before uh you're the

461
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,839
third person today to come into Guitar

462
00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:30,360
Center and play that lick I promise you

463
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:32,339
but uh bet between the music industry

464
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:34,019
and guitar center learning about the

465
00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:36,000
music business and then learning about

466
00:15:34,019 --> 00:15:38,339
the music equipment industry how they're

467
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,419
just kind of some they make you think

468
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:41,100
you're buying one thing and you're

469
00:15:39,419 --> 00:15:42,599
really not the things that the artists

470
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:44,759
have you can't really buy that unless

471
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:46,620
you get it custom made and [ __ ] but that

472
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:48,720
I felt bamboozled by both the music

473
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:50,399
industry and the gear industry so yeah

474
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,440
it did make me a little bit bitter let's

475
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:54,839
see there is more uh change how you make

476
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:57,540
music feel now if I could play in a band

477
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:59,220
now with just like a bunch of old guys

478
00:15:57,539 --> 00:16:01,139
around here local I'm not saying oh guys

479
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:02,699
I'm [ __ ] 40 something years old if I

480
00:16:01,139 --> 00:16:04,259
could get a bunch of 40 or 50 year old

481
00:16:02,698 --> 00:16:06,240
guys that just wanted to play for fun

482
00:16:04,259 --> 00:16:08,220
and there were no contracts no alcohol

483
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,620
no drugs and none of that [ __ ] involved

484
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:12,180
it would be a lot of fun just to just

485
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:13,560
say hey learn these 10 tracks and we'll

486
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:14,879
go play them in the garage tomorrow so

487
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:16,979
that all of our wives can hang out and

488
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:18,720
watch us play like rock stars that would

489
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:20,339
be fun that's where it would be fun for

490
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,379
me but like being on the road and all

491
00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:24,360
that [ __ ] the spotlight and [ __ ] with

492
00:16:22,379 --> 00:16:26,698
music doesn't sound fun anymore so yeah

493
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:28,019
it did change how I feel about it our

494
00:16:26,698 --> 00:16:29,879
friend wrapped this message up with gave

495
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:30,899
my mom a hug that is super cool thank

496
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:32,639
you bro

497
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:34,740
um tell Mama that you got your message

498
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,659
on the podcast all right I'm gonna keep

499
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:39,899
going this minute next message came from

500
00:16:36,659 --> 00:16:41,578
our friend Uncle GG it says what's your

501
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:44,940
favorite song to play while in the

502
00:16:41,578 --> 00:16:45,539
garden or while gardening in general

503
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:47,639
um

504
00:16:45,539 --> 00:16:49,319
think the Edibles I ate are kicking in

505
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:51,180
because as I was reading that the words

506
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:53,579
got smaller and the lights got brighter

507
00:16:51,179 --> 00:16:54,599
so something's happening over here

508
00:16:53,578 --> 00:16:56,758
um what was the question I don't even

509
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:59,278
remember uh favorite song to play while

510
00:16:56,759 --> 00:17:01,680
in the garden or while gardening in

511
00:16:59,278 --> 00:17:03,299
general that's a very good question I

512
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:04,500
know I have vague answers for all of

513
00:17:03,299 --> 00:17:07,558
these questions I'm going to say that

514
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:10,259
depends on a lot of things

515
00:17:07,558 --> 00:17:12,240
um what is the mood that I'm already in

516
00:17:10,259 --> 00:17:14,459
when I walk into the garden is that mood

517
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:17,099
the mood I need to be in or do I need to

518
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:19,259
shift my mood so maybe I just went to

519
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:20,818
lunch and like I came back to hyper and

520
00:17:19,259 --> 00:17:23,279
I can't focus or something maybe I'll

521
00:17:20,818 --> 00:17:24,959
put on like a Joe Rogan podcast just to

522
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:26,699
slow down my brain and just kind of get

523
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,500
me into what Rogan's saying and then

524
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:30,360
I'll slow down a little bit or maybe the

525
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,919
opposite maybe I smoke too many [ __ ]

526
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:34,139
dabs on my lunch break and I'm [ __ ]

527
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:35,700
goofy right duh can't figure it out

528
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:38,280
that's when I'll go in and put on some

529
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:40,319
[ __ ] like really fast fish like punch

530
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:44,220
you in the eye or something by fish tube

531
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:46,200
uh maybe sand or first tube or Sigma

532
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:48,839
Oasis or something [ __ ] say it to me

533
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,220
Santos put some [ __ ] like that on and

534
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:52,199
that'll give me some energy and get me

535
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:54,480
moved up but it all just depends on the

536
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:56,340
needed shift the needed change or the

537
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,259
needed Vibe if there's a lot of people

538
00:17:56,339 --> 00:17:59,819
in the grow uh we'll just put on some

539
00:17:58,259 --> 00:18:02,038
classic rock and turn it down kind of

540
00:17:59,819 --> 00:18:03,298
low one thing that I like to do in a

541
00:18:02,038 --> 00:18:06,000
commercial grow that really encourages

542
00:18:03,298 --> 00:18:07,679
people to get there first is uh if you

543
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,940
were first in the commercial grow that I

544
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,559
manage if you're the first employee

545
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:12,360
there you get to pick the music for the

546
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:14,099
first quarter of the day so that means

547
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:16,019
from eight o'clock until 10 o'clock the

548
00:18:14,099 --> 00:18:17,399
music is your choice we got guys that

549
00:18:16,019 --> 00:18:19,079
listen to Country we got guys that

550
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:21,240
listen to death metal there's a guy that

551
00:18:19,079 --> 00:18:22,500
listens to this weird math metal uh the

552
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:24,179
same Rhythm doesn't happen more than

553
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:26,220
twice and it's all in like really odd

554
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:27,900
[ __ ] time signatures but that's what

555
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:29,579
the dude likes if he's there first bro

556
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:31,559
we're listening to math metal for two

557
00:18:29,579 --> 00:18:32,939
hours I got a guy that listens to Crazy

558
00:18:31,558 --> 00:18:34,798
Rap we got a guy that listens to old

559
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:36,058
school hip-hop you never know what you

560
00:18:34,798 --> 00:18:38,519
might get but the first one to get there

561
00:18:36,058 --> 00:18:40,918
gets to put on the [ __ ] music

562
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:42,359
um so it does it mainly if it's up to me

563
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:44,340
and my personal grow it depends on the

564
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:46,500
mental state that I need to be in if I

565
00:18:44,339 --> 00:18:48,298
need to if I'm like sweeping floors and

566
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:50,038
just doing like stuff where I'm not

567
00:18:48,298 --> 00:18:51,839
paying super super attention I might

568
00:18:50,038 --> 00:18:53,640
have some faster loud or funkier music

569
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:55,500
on it's going to be

570
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,820
um most likely some fish you never know

571
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,380
could be some Reggae it could be some

572
00:18:56,819 --> 00:19:00,000
old school Grateful Dead it could be mo

573
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:01,020
I like to listen to a lot of Mo in the

574
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,819
garden that gives you a lot of energy

575
00:19:01,019 --> 00:19:04,619
but like I said if it's something where

576
00:19:02,819 --> 00:19:06,178
I if I'm cutting clones and I need to

577
00:19:04,619 --> 00:19:08,339
slow down and like pay attention or

578
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:10,559
something then I may put on like a

579
00:19:08,339 --> 00:19:12,418
slower podcast that just like kind of or

580
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:14,700
maybe even some slower older Grateful

581
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:16,320
Dead just to get my brain in that slower

582
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:18,240
Pace instead of zipping through the job

583
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:20,579
I want to go a little bit more patiently

584
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,440
have a little bit more Focus get the job

585
00:19:20,579 --> 00:19:24,359
done a little bit more uh what's the

586
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:27,419
word I'm looking for mindfulness I want

587
00:19:24,359 --> 00:19:29,038
to be more aware be there be here now

588
00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:30,299
that's the thing I'm going for sometimes

589
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:32,160
but also when you're just doing that

590

625
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:47,038
down Sweden uh Miss irie or dread Vibes

626
00:20:44,579 --> 00:20:48,538
or Zara as you know her is originally

627
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:50,400
from Sweden she's only been here in the

628
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:52,980
states for about 10 years I would love

629
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,840
to go to Sweden and see uh the things

630
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:56,160
that she tells me about she tells me

631
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:58,199
about her childhood and her life before

632
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:59,880
she came to the states and she tells me

633
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,860
how different it is there and like just

634
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:03,240
subtle differences and major differences

635
00:21:01,859 --> 00:21:05,519
and a lot of things I would like to go

636
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:07,259
experience that smell the air see the

637
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:08,460
the mountain in the city and all the

638
00:21:07,259 --> 00:21:09,779
stuff that she talks about go see

639
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:12,000
Stockholm because she tells me a lot

640
00:21:09,779 --> 00:21:14,220
about that that would be a fun time just

641
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,779
another way to just I've never thought

642
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:17,100
of going to Sweden until I got with her

643
00:21:15,779 --> 00:21:19,678
and it sounds like a lot of fun and it's

644
00:21:17,099 --> 00:21:21,178
really random so that'd be super cool

645
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,798
um then a random place that I wrote down

646
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:24,720
which is really attainable it's just all

647
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:28,500
about timing and I've never bothered to

648
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:30,120
do this is the DW Factory in Oxnard

649
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,798
California

650
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:33,178
um I am a drummer I've played the drums

651
00:21:31,798 --> 00:21:36,000
I've said this on the show maybe today

652
00:21:33,179 --> 00:21:39,059
since I was about 14 years old I really

653
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,159
enjoy DW collector series drums that's

654
00:21:39,058 --> 00:21:42,678
something I'm fond of they are made in a

655
00:21:41,159 --> 00:21:45,240
factory in Oxnard California

656
00:21:42,679 --> 00:21:47,759
occasionally they do DW day and you get

657
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:49,620
to go do tours for some reason I feel

658
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:51,960
giddy inside when I think about going to

659
00:21:49,619 --> 00:21:54,479
do a DW tour it sounds great you get to

660
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:55,798
watch them simply make drum sets I know

661
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,960
it sounds crazy you could watch How It's

662
00:21:55,798 --> 00:21:59,279
Made right but I want to smell the

different kinds of wood I want to hear

664
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:03,000
the machines I want to be in there I'm

665
00:22:01,619 --> 00:22:04,678
fond of the guy that owns the company

666
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,019

667

Factory in Oxnard California they quit

680

then you never know which of your

691
00:22:51,058 --> 00:22:54,359
favorite drummers could pop in every day

692
00:22:52,679 --> 00:22:56,400
they just show random people like look

693
00:22:54,359 --> 00:22:57,538
who popped into the DW offices today and

694
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,400
it could be your favorite drummer

695
00:22:57,538 --> 00:23:01,919
anybody from like Eric Moore to Thomas

696
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:04,440
Lang to Peter Erskine all kinds of great

697
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:06,179
people are DW endorses so you never know

698
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:07,679
who could pop in you never know I could

699
00:23:06,179 --> 00:23:08,700
get a free Drum Lesson throw some

700
