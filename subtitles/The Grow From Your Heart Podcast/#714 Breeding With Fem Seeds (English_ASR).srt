topic for this podcast here i've got a

101
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,158
screenshot here in my phone i'm going to

102
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:45,679
grab the phone no i'm not flirting with

103
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:47,439
anybody i'm not scrolling instagram

104
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,040
looking at butts and boobs i am actually

105
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:51,280
reading a message here on the screen i'm

106
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:52,479
looking for it this one i found this on

107
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,640
youtube

108
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:56,399
i've said this before i prefer not to

109
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:58,798
take the comments from the youtube

110
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,560
channel it's much easier to capture them

111
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,239
and print them and use them here on the

112
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,920
show when they come through either an

113
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,519
email or the grow help tab on the

114
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:08,039
website let's talk about that before we

115
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,000
even get to this on the website

116
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:12,239
iriegenetics.com there is a grow help

117
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,239
tab there's a tab that says grow help if

118
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,920
you have questions or need grow help

119
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:17,680
with your plants all you have to do is

120
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:19,279
fill out a quick uh it's like a

121
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,639
questionnaire it's like basically asking

122
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:22,638
your blood pressure height and weight

123
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,160
but we do it about the plant what are

124
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,720
you growing are you indoors are you

125
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,720
outdoors are you growing under led hps

126
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,080
ceramic metal halide or using campfire

127
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,440
and flashlights

128
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:33,199
what kind of soil are you in are you

129
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:35,040
using hydro what are you doing i want to

130
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,960
know some questions and then i give you

131
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,800
an opportunity to type in your question

132
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:40,638
and ask what you need help with the

133
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,240
reason i ask so many preliminary

134
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,680
questions is because questions is

135
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,519
because people say

136
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,519
why are my plants yellow and i'm like

137
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:49,680
well that could be a billion things with

138
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:51,918
that little questionnaire that little uh

139
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,600
preview that little uh survey that helps

140
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:56,079
me get an idea of what's going on with

141
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,680
your plants in your grow room it answers

142
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:59,758
all the questions i was going to reply

143
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,120
with anyway it saves us a step so if

144
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,120
you've got grow questions if you need

145
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,600
grow help i do recommend the grow help

146
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,280
tab on iregenetics.com that goes

147
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,800
straight to the phone when you send that

148
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:10,719
message it goes to my phone my phone

149
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,800
jingles i will check that then i will

150
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,080
print it it'll end up in paper that's

151
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,759
the best way to get it on the show i've

152
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:17,758
got papers piled up i know which episode

153
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,600
they go to their paper clip together

154
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,919
that's just my organization it's easier

155
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,520
that way however i did like this one

156
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:25,038
this one came from youtube i'm not going

157
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:26,240
to read a lot of them from youtube

158
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:27,839
because it's harder to find them it's

159
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,120
harder to print them keep them access

160
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:32,478
them file them but this one was good

161
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,800
[ __ ] high and rambly but it's going

162
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:37,839
to work out this one goes a little bit a

163
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,918
lot if not just like this it says can i

164
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:42,959
do this with feminized seeds and then

165
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:44,719
they ask a question clone a p1 so that

166
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:47,279
basically means grow a plant you've

167
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,199
grown your parent your p1 so we're going

168
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:50,879
to clone the p1 which was feminized

169
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,319
we're going to we've assumed this was

170
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:56,000
feminized they're asking about femme

171
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:58,560
seeds clone the p1 use colloidal silver

172
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,120
on one clone and use that to pollinate

173
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,120
multiple plants so far yes you can

174
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,280
absolutely do that that's what i do that

175
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:08,560
is what is commonly done we're going to

176
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:10,559
take a p1 plant and we're going to clone

177
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,079
that we're going to reverse one and then

178
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,519
we're going to do what i call pollen

179
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:15,918
chucking we're going to put that pollen

180
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:17,839
on a cut of the same thing and a cut of

181
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:19,519
other things and now we've got a

182
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:22,239
breeding project you're off to a good

183
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:23,918
start here so far makes sense i get it

184
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,639
it goes on though it says now i'm going

185
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:28,318
to take another p1 clone and spray that

186
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,319
across that with the seeds from the

187
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,080
first batch and that should give me f2

188
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,680
seeds right thanks buddy i've been

189
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:36,000
watching you more and more lately big

190
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,478
shout out to our friend sean cross from

191
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,560
the youtube i'm not sure

192
00:06:38,478 --> 00:06:42,159
um there's parts of this question that i

193
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,079
have questions about

194
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,360
so i'm going to clarify that right here

195
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:47,519
when you say

196
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,720
then take another p1 clone and spray

197
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:51,680
that

198
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,199
if that p1 so what you have to do now if

199
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,720
you want to make the f2 there's a

200
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,800
specific step because you could mess

201
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,039
this up let me try to clarify the

202
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:02,720
question and then i'm going to of course

203
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:04,879
ramble on rose about this um if so

204
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,479
you're going to take a plant and it does

205
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:07,918
not matter if it's feminized or

206
00:07:06,478 --> 00:07:09,038
non-feminized i'm going to talk that's

207
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:10,318
going to be the main chunk of this

208
00:07:09,038 --> 00:07:12,240
podcast here let me scroll up and get

209
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,680
myself to that part of the notes

210
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,319
we're going to talk about that part a

211
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,680
lot here but um let me get myself back

212
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,280
on track so we're going to take a

213
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,959
feminized plan it doesn't matter at this

214
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:22,079
point if it's regular or feminized it is

215
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:23,918
all the same that's what i'm going to

216
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:25,359
ramble about in a moment here we're

217
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:26,959
going to take a plan we're going to

218
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,400
clone it and then just like i said we're

219
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:31,038
going to reverse it you can use silver

220
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:32,478
thiosulfate you can use colladial silver

221
00:07:31,038 --> 00:07:34,399
uh whatever works best for your

222
00:07:32,478 --> 00:07:36,800
situation your experience go ahead do

223
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:38,399
that reverse it chuck some pollen now

224
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,960
you're gonna make seeds

225
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:43,839
now to make f2

226
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:46,159
which is the second filial generation

227
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:47,918
you have to take seeds a batch of those

228
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,039
seeds that come from the same plant so

229
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:50,878
let's just say

230
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:53,120
you took a golden goat and you

231
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:56,560
pollinated lemon skunk now you've now

232
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,720
made lemon jeffree it's an r1 also

233
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,879
technically can be an f1 for this case

234
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,199
we're going to call it an f1 to make an

235
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:06,560
f2 you would have to take a batch of

236
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:08,000
those lemon jeffrey f1 seeds or s1s it's

237
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,319
the same thing

238
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,399
or r1 is what a technically it's an r1

239
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,800
and an f1 at the same time you have to

240
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:16,638
take seeds out of that batch and find

241
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,720
you're gonna have to reverse that and to

242
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,720
make that again with

243
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,800
the same male and female out of that

244
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,280
batch because that's how you make the

245
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,800
filial generation if you go back and use

246
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:29,439
one of the males or females from

247
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:32,000
previous notice i said go back that is a

248
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:34,639
back cross if they came from the same

249
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,320
batch of seeds if that's a this is a

250
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:38,240
philly so when you make seeds what comes

251
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,080
out of there is the filial generation if

252
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,399
they are the same filial generation that

253
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,240
you're crossing then you move forward in

254
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:47,278
filial generations if you cross to

255
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:49,839
anything else you are making a new f1 or

256
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:52,000
a back cross so i think that will sum up

257
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:53,360
that part of the question if you make

258
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,360
seeds

259
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,200
take if you only cross one plant to

260
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,959
another plant and then you get those

261
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,480
seeds and you find a male and a female

262
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:02,479
out of those or a female that you

263
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,879
reverse out of those and cross that

264
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,560
again that is f2 because that's a filial

265
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:08,879
generation moving forward if you move

266
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:11,278
backwards using a previous parent or a

267
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:12,958
previous mom now you are going backwards

268
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:15,039
to a back cross i hope that makes it

269
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:16,879
clear now the chunk of this i want to

270
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:19,278
focus on is something you really said at

271
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:22,240
the beginning was a feminized plant you

272
00:09:19,278 --> 00:09:24,278
said can i do this with feminized seeds

273
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,480
there's a lot of myths misconceptions

274
00:09:24,278 --> 00:09:27,600
misunderstandings rumors falsities

275
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:31,360
[ __ ]

276
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:33,278
um what is it wackness uh [ __ ] around

277
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,039
feminized seeds there's it's a lot of

278
00:09:33,278 --> 00:09:37,360
rumors and [ __ ] that people don't simply

279
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:39,039
do not understand around feminized seeds

280
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,560
and that is understandable if you only

281
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:42,559
learn from the internet if you only

282
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:44,639
learn from what your cousin's uncles

283
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:46,719
told you that he heard from his brother

284
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:49,439
in vietnam that they met at a boot camp

285
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,040
one time like that info is old and who

286
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,240
knows what the [ __ ] that person really

287
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:53,679
said and somebody heard one thing

288
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,440
because we only half pay attention when

289
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:56,319
we [ __ ] listen to each other anyway

290
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,920
so

291
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,000
a lot of people have misinformation

292
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:01,120
misconceptions bad info about femme

293
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,759
seeds

294
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:06,399
feminized seeds are no different than a

295
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:08,559
regular seed other than the fact that

296
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,958
the pollen the pollen is the difference

297
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:13,518
the pollen was the part that was

298
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:16,000
feminized the plants are the same exact

299
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:18,159
thing as a male female plant except you

300
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,919
won't find that male chromosome which

301
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:22,159
would have been transferred in the

302
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:24,719
pollen i'm going to borrow a lesson from

303
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:27,919
my friend mr soul big shout out to mr

304
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,680
soul ah mr solon is amazing dude puts

305
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:31,439
out some great seeds puts out the cindy

306
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:34,000
99 and some other great [ __ ] big shout

307
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,800
out to brothers grim seed company mr

308
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,559
soul made the greatest analogy that i

309
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:40,159
can ever think of i can't come up with

310
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:42,479
anything better than this but i want to

311
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:44,480
give him credit because give credit when

312
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,320
credit is due you've got to honor and

313
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,560
credit your teachers your masters

314
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,800
something mr soul taught us

315
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:53,359
the best way i can explain it when we

316
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:55,519
make feminized pollen we are reversing a

317
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,680
female plant this is a full here i'm

318
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,120
going to go on a side tangent of my

319
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:00,719
tangent we're walking down alleys

320
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,839
holding hands come with me let's do this

321
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,278
together

322
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:06,000
a lot of people say that when we make

323
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:07,838
femme seeds we are using a treatment to

324
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,919
make the female plant become a

325
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,680
hermaphrodite that is not true that is

326
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:13,759
not accurate

327
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:15,679
these plants are not intersex or

328
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:17,919
hermaphroditic plants if they were i

329
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:19,679
would not be making seeds with them i

330
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:21,759
stress test them and make sure they are

331
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:25,199
not intersex plants what i'm doing is

332
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:27,838
not causing hermaphroditism or intersex

333
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,440
so this is hermaphrodite intersex that

334
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:31,279
is not the right word here these plants

335
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,519
are reversed they are treated and

336
00:11:31,278 --> 00:11:36,000
reversed to make pollen they are not

337
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,600
male plants uh they are female plants

338
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,039
creating pollen so they're reversed

339
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,040
they're treated they're not intersex

340
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:43,278
they're not hermaphrodites let's get

341
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:45,439
that correct now the part that mr soul

342
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:47,759
taught us when we make feminized seeds

343
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:50,079
we're treating the female plant a fully

344
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:51,120
female plant i touch on that again fully

345
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:54,078
female

346
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:57,120
we treat that with a either silver style

347
00:11:54,078 --> 00:11:59,519
silver thiosulfate or colloidal silver i

348
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,440
prefer the thiosulfate i can't say it

349
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:04,000
today i [ __ ] promise i know what it

350
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,560
is i prefer the silver thiosulfate

351
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,039
method myself if you do the other way or

352
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:10,958
any other way have fun power to the

353
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:13,120
people do your [ __ ] thing

354
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:16,239
so we have learned how to make female

355
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,919
plants produce pollen mr soul says uh

356
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,079
taught us that basically we have learned

357
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:22,559
to put up a filter imagine your male

358
00:12:20,078 --> 00:12:25,439
plant your pollen donor or in this case

359
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:27,759
our reversed female plant is right here

360
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,680
it's over here it's making pollen it's

361
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:31,759
it's [ __ ] it's busting a load it's

362
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:33,120
doing its thing you're gonna sneeze

363
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:35,439
that's the [ __ ] that's what it's doing

364
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,440
it's making you [ __ ] sneeze over here

365
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,959
we've got female plants they've got

366
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,320
their their hairs like you guys like to

367
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,439
call them they're they're ready to go

368
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,278
they're ready to get pollinated their

369
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,800
female parts are sticking up these

370
00:12:43,278 --> 00:12:46,879
plants are horny we got dudes blowing

371
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:48,399
loads or a reversed female blowing a

372
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:50,399
load we got ladies over here ready to

373
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,958
get it right somehow through the magic

374
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:55,440
of science basically what we have done

375
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:57,759
by reversing these plants mr soul says

376
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,399
we put up a screen that works as a

377
00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:01,919
filter that only sucks out male pollen

378
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:03,919
because the sex is determined through

379
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:06,078
the pollen that pollen is going to hit a

380
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:08,000
female plant those chromosomes then are

381
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:09,679
going to mix if there's male chromosomes

382
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,278
in there that's when the plants will

383
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:12,719
decide if it'll be a male or a female

384
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:15,278
plant we've already got the female

385
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,519
pollen going over there no male pollen

386
00:13:15,278 --> 00:13:19,278
so the only difference is we basically

387
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:21,278
found a filter or a vacuum and we're

388
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:24,399
sucking out the male pollen out of the

389
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:26,559
sky before that male sperm ever lands on

390
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:28,480
the plants it's only female sperm female

391
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:30,559
pollen getting over there we're only

392
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,079
making female babies that is not the

393
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:34,000
scientific method but that is the

394
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:36,159
easiest way to explain it that most

395
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
people will understand once again credit

396
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:41,120
to mr soul for that explanation because

397
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,559
that is the most uh reliable teachable

398
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:46,159
explanation i've ever heard we have

399
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:47,679
found a way to suck out the male paul in

400
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:49,439
so the only big difference in these

401
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:52,399
seeds in the offspring is that there

402
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,880
will not be any males now this is

403
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:57,278
science and nature coming together and

404
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:59,198
nature always has a way i have seen

405
00:13:57,278 --> 00:14:00,838
full-on male plants pop up from

406
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:03,919
feminized projects that is not

407
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:06,480
impossible it is highly unlikely and

408
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:08,399
highly uncommon but it does happen that

409
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,159
is just because this is nature and

410
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,399
science and we cannot control everything

411
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:15,278
you guys have seen jurassic park life

412
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:16,879
does find a way [ __ ] does happen but if

413
00:14:15,278 --> 00:14:17,639
we do this correctly we should come up

414
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:22,320
with

415
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:24,079
99.9 percent pure female offspring now

416
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,240
with that being said there should not be

417
00:14:24,078 --> 00:14:29,519
any significant difference in the

418
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:32,159
performance of a feminized or a regular

419
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,919
seed they should both germinate the same

420
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:35,519
they should veg at the same rate of

421
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:37,439
course you're going to have strain

422
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,440
dependent variables i've got some

423
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,639
strains that simply veg slower than

424
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,959
others and it doesn't matter if they

425
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,879
came from a femme seed or a regular seed

426
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:47,439
that's just the vigor and growth of that

427
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:49,439
specific plant i truly do not think that

428
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,279
regular or feminized has anything to do

429
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,279
with it because sometimes

430
00:14:51,278 --> 00:14:56,240
the slower growing plants honestly can

431
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:58,399
be those regular seeds so they germinate

432
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:01,039
the same they veg the same they flower

433
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:03,360
the same the potency will be the same

434
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:04,958
the per okay here's something that i

435
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,120
will say can be different i found two

436
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:09,518
variables as i'm thinking about this i

437
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,600
find less intersex plants in packs of

438
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:12,480
feminized seeds than i do in regular

439
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,480
seeds

440
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,079
now since we've got feminized seeds

441
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:19,440
dialed down and breeders are doing the

442
00:15:16,078 --> 00:15:21,759
work i do find more problematic seeds in

443
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,680
regular packs so that is something i do

444
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:25,439
notice that i will testify to as

445
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:26,958
something who pops a lot of seeds grows

446
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,360
a lot of plants works with a lot of

447
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:32,399
seeds i do see more anomalies more

448
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:35,278
variables more freaks from the regular

449
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,000
seeds now another thing i can testify to

450
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:39,278
is

451
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:43,120
there is likely and commonly less

452
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:45,439
variation in feminized seeds why is that

453
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:47,440
because if we're making a self plant if

454
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:50,000
we're making let's say golden goat self

455
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,839
seeds a golden goat feminized plant i

456
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,919
cut a clone of golden goat i cut another

457
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:56,240
clone of golden goat i treat one with

458
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:58,479
our silver if it's thiosulfate or

459
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,959
colloidal silver whichever we treat one

460
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:03,759
clone we use that pollen to put on what

461
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:05,599
golden goat what genetics are in there

462
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:07,039
golden goat that's pure golden goat

463
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,120
you're not going to find anything but

464
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:10,639
golden goat you may see some

465
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,560
grandparents some parent traits of

466
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:15,039
golden goat but you're not going to find

467
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:17,679
adulterated golden goat the other option

468
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:19,838
is golden goat bx which of course you've

469
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:21,758
got another plant in there another line

470
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,639
of genetics which adulterate that which

471
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,759
give you

472
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:28,480
way more phenotypical options so in my

473
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:32,159
opinion in my experience in my testimony

474
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:35,120
i see and find less variation amongst

475
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:36,639
feminized seeds so that's a pro to the

476
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,000
fem seeds i was going to try to say that

477
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:39,919
there's no difference in that they're

478
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,320
even but we have found a solid

479
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:45,039
difference here in the regular seeds i

480
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:47,360
do find more problems more mutants more

481
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:50,000
weirdos more intersex plants in the

482
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:52,639
femmes i see less variation more

483
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,519
reliability which is what we are calling

484
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:57,198
stability in the cannabis space

485
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,799
so let's elaborate on this a lot part of

486
00:16:57,198 --> 00:17:00,799
this question was about breeding with

487
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:02,479
femmes i often get asked can you breed

488
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:04,480
with feminized seeds can you keep

489
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,160
mothers of feminized seeds and the

490
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:09,279
answer to all of that is

491
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:11,919
yes they're just like a regular male

492
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:13,519
female plant except you did not have to

493
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:15,839
[ __ ] with the male plants when you were

494
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:18,798
doing the sexing if the breeder did the

495
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:20,879
work that feminized seed will be

496
00:17:18,798 --> 00:17:22,720
everything the same it'll have the vigor

497
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,480
i've said this before it will be

498
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:27,279
all the traits all the qualities all of

499
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,798
the abilities of a regular plant except

500
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:31,678
you don't have to worry about getting a

501
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:33,679
male in that pack oftentimes there's no

502
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:35,360
way to get a certain strain like real

503
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:38,160
gorilla glue people talk about they've

504
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:39,918
got gorilla gorilla glue number four the

505
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,600
only way you've got it was a clone only

506
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:43,120
unless you got the clone

507
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:44,558
if you bought seeds they had to be

508
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:47,119
feminized seeds because there was

509
00:17:44,558 --> 00:17:48,720
nothing put out there were no seeds put

510
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:51,199
out of the gorilla glue so if you wanted

511
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:53,360
seeds of it you had to get feminized

512
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,919
seeds it had to be the gorilla glue cut

513
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:58,240
a clone cut another clone reverse it put

514
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:00,000
it on the gorilla glue make feminized

515
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,079
self seeds that was the only way to get

516
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,160
it otherwise you had to adulterate it

517
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:05,839
and cross it to whatever i was working

518
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,360
with was it king solomon maybe i did

519
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:09,199
that maybe i hit the gorilla glue with

520
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:11,359
solomon maybe i've got something in the

521
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,440
works right now with a feminized gorilla

522
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:15,519
glue project coming up that i don't want

523
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,120
to talk about yet but the reason that we

524
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:20,319
do a lot of femme stuff is because it is

525
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:21,839
simply not available in the regular form

526
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:23,839
and we've wanted really we don't want to

527
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:25,439
put out misrepresentations of our lines

528
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:27,359
out there i put out

529
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,840
golden goat femme seeds and i don't want

530
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:32,399
to ruin the reputation of golden goat by

531
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:34,079
putting out [ __ ] so we did i did

532
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,480
work hard at making sure that those

533
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:38,159
seeds were correct so um

534
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,319
i got on a big ramble there i think

535
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,480
there are uh less very you can use here

536
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:44,240
i am i'm back on track you can use uh

537
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,798
feminized seeds for anything that you

538
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,720
can use a regular male female seed for

539
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:51,038
you can make a mom out of it you can cut

540
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,558
clones with it you can breed to it you

541
00:18:51,038 --> 00:18:54,558
can do anything and it will work

542
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:56,879
beautifully if you have done your

543
00:18:54,558 --> 00:18:58,879
selection properly also that goes back

544
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,360
to if the breeder did their work

545
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:04,080
properly did they select female plants

546
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:06,399
that did not show any intersex traits do

547
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:08,639
they select plants that handle stress

548
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:11,038
well handle bugs well uh possibly

549
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:13,919
pathogens well abuse well

550
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:15,919
i really try when i'm making fem seeds

551
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,520
that are going to market i try to find

552
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:20,160
plants that you can beat the [ __ ] out of

553
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:22,240
because i want uh i want my clientele to

554
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,600
be able to have a product that they can

555
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,919
beat up i want to set them up for

556
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:28,240
success so i find plants that can take

557
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:29,840
abuse can handle pests pathogens

558
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,839
problems that's really what i'm looking

559
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:33,839
for so did the breeder do the work did

560
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:36,000
they stress test their plants did they

561
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:37,759
sex test them do they intersex test them

562
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,440
and put them through the ringer before

563
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:41,038
they bred to them so if they did all

564
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,360
that part then you did your proper

565
00:19:41,038 --> 00:19:44,720
selection if you selected your females

566
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:46,639
and you ran them through a few stress

567
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,079
tests a couple of times did the proper

568
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,320
phenol hunt then if you're going to

569
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:52,558
breed with them they will work just like

570
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:54,079
any other seeds i made lemon jeffrey

571
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:56,319
let's talk again about lemon jeffree

572
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:58,558
that is a uh it's a lemon skunk plant

573
00:19:56,319 --> 00:20:00,480
from greenhouse seeds i got it uh in a

574
00:19:58,558 --> 00:20:02,960
pack of seeds as a gift it is a champion

575
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,240
lemon skunk i came from seed so nobody's

576
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,919
got the one that i've got that's one of

577
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,679
the best parts about growing from seed

578
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:10,000
i've got this phenotype that you don't

579
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:12,640
have so i've got the lemon skunk i

580
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,880
reversed golden goat i put that reversed

581
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:17,840
golden goat pollen onto the lemon skunk

582
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:20,000
we now made lemon jeffrey i have got the

583
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:22,798
prized keeper of lemon jeffrey i've got

584
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,480
the champion it's amazing this cut of

585
00:20:22,798 --> 00:20:26,639
lemon jeffrey does everything you would

586
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:29,120
want it to do it tastes amazing it hits

587
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:32,000
in potency it hits in weight it grows

588
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:34,319
quickly it's a perfect [ __ ] plant so

589
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,079
i took that plant and i pollinated it

590
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:38,240
what did i pollinate it with i've hit it

591
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:40,558
with the grateful dog i've also hit it

592
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,480
oh the grateful dog is also feminized

593
00:20:40,558 --> 00:20:44,960
what that's a great thing to talk about

594
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:47,279
grateful dog is feminized lemon jeffrey

595
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:50,000
is feminized i have reversed the

596
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:52,240
grateful dog and put that pollen on the

597
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,599
feminized lemon jeffrey and that makes

598
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:57,200
amazing what feminized offspring what

599
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:58,558
yeah i've never released those too many

600
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,798
people i put out some testers and then

601
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:02,079
my social media accounts got squashed

602
00:21:00,798 --> 00:21:03,918
right as i put those out and i lost

603
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:05,359
contact with all those testers and i've

604
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:06,799
only got a few seeds left i can make

605
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:09,038
more but that's not what i'm gonna do

606
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:11,038
right now also uh with that what else

607
00:21:09,038 --> 00:21:13,519
have we made we have made lemon sunrise

608
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:15,759
that's lemon jeffrey to the arise

609
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:17,918
that's a regular king solomon regular

610
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:20,319
mail to a feminized plant that makes

611
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:21,840
amazing offspring so yes i do keep a

612
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:24,079
lemon jeffrey mother plant it's been

613
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:25,599
around for a long time the grateful dog

614
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:27,599
is a feminized mother plant which has

615
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:30,240
been around for a long time which has

616
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:32,158
been bred to regular and feminized stuff

617
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,798
so i've done it both ways you guys

618
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:36,960
i've done regular male plants to

619
00:21:34,798 --> 00:21:39,918
feminized females and i've done reversed

620
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:41,840
females to regular uh

621
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:43,280
females which sounds weird i've done

622
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:45,599
everything you can think about doing

623
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:48,000
reverse to regular regular to reverse

624
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:49,839
reverse to reverse i've done it all and

625
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,159
they all work because their plants and

626
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:54,158
that feminized factor only makes a

627
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:56,720
difference when it comes to making the

628
00:21:54,159 --> 00:22:00,000
seeds and ensuring that the consumer the

629
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:03,200
customer the clientele the grower ends

630
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,960
up with a feminized seed a feminized

631
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,960
plant all right i've been rambling i

632
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,720
think i've covered my notes here i think

633
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,640
i covered all the bullet points i wanted

634
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,319
to touch on i don't know how long this

635
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,799
episode was i feel like i was going fast

636
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:16,319
it feels kind of quick but once again um

637
00:22:14,798 --> 00:22:18,240
i don't need to ramble and make this too

638
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:20,639
long it would just get worse from here

639
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,640
so let's start wrapping it up um ladies

640
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,799
