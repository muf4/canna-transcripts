world it's time for episode 306 of the

26
00:00:57,859 --> 00:01:01,219
girl from your heart podcast I like to

27
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:02,870
start these episodes off by letting you

28
00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:05,868
know what I've been dabbing on today

29
00:01:02,869 --> 00:01:07,938
today I'm taking dabs of jet fuel live

30
00:01:05,868 --> 00:01:11,478
resin full-spectrum extract from Green

31
00:01:07,938 --> 00:01:13,129
Dot labs this stuff has been amazing

32
00:01:11,478 --> 00:01:14,718
I've got a little tiny jar with a little

33
00:01:13,129 --> 00:01:17,748
bit left and when I crack open this jar

34
00:01:14,718 --> 00:01:21,248
the aroma just fills this room this

35
00:01:17,748 --> 00:01:24,438
whole room is filled with a skunky funky

36
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:26,748
feely gassy sort of a smell I guess you

37
00:01:24,438 --> 00:01:29,888
would call it jet fuel I opened this jar

38
00:01:26,748 --> 00:01:31,998
and the smell that comes out is like

39
00:01:29,888 --> 00:01:33,828
kinda smells like you were kicking a

40
00:01:31,998 --> 00:01:36,259
skunk in the ass all day and then you

41
00:01:33,828 --> 00:01:38,538
tried to rinse that aroma off with some

42
00:01:36,259 --> 00:01:40,759
diesel fuel then you threw those hot

43
00:01:38,539 --> 00:01:42,668
shoes in the car and the Sun all day and

44
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:45,679
then you've got in the car and that

45
00:01:42,668 --> 00:01:46,848
overwhelming fuel II skunky smell that

46
00:01:45,679 --> 00:01:48,769
hits your eyes and kind of makes your

47
00:01:46,849 --> 00:01:50,029
eyes burn it makes you squint that's

48
00:01:48,769 --> 00:01:52,638
what this smells like and it is

49
00:01:50,028 --> 00:01:55,069
beautiful I love it it is fuel E it's

50
00:01:52,638 --> 00:01:56,269
skunky it's disgustingly beautiful and I

51
00:01:55,069 --> 00:01:59,090
can't get enough of it

52
00:01:56,269 --> 00:02:01,789
the texture and appearance are all so

53
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:04,278
beautiful it is perfectly golden and

54
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:07,668
clear what I like about it a lot is the

55
00:02:04,278 --> 00:02:10,280
amount of crystals or chunks and the

56
00:02:07,668 --> 00:02:11,840
amount of liquids or turps it is not too

57
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,729
runny and too saucy for me I don't

58
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,530
prefer the really liquid concentrate

59
00:02:13,729 --> 00:02:19,009
I prefer the chunkier so this is

60
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:21,650
probably 70% chunks and 30% crystals

61
00:02:19,009 --> 00:02:23,479
which is just about right for my style I

62
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:25,370
really like it I was able to get a big

63
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:28,399
fat dab on the dabber I really

64
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:30,769
appreciate that when I took the dab it

65
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,390
gave me the most intense cottonmouth

66
00:02:30,769 --> 00:02:34,519
I haven't had cottonmouth like that in

67
00:02:32,389 --> 00:02:36,289
quite a long time that was kind of nice

68
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:38,299
it tasted really well the cottonmouth

69
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:40,340
had a pleasant I tasted just like the

70
00:02:38,299 --> 00:02:43,760
concentrate it also gave me a nice eye

71
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:45,439
high and also I found myself standing in

72
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:47,989
the middle of the kitchen for no reason

73
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:49,969
after I took that dab I had a drink and

74
00:02:47,989 --> 00:02:51,920
I have eaten I wasn't hungry or need a

75
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:53,030
drink or anything but I took a DAB and

76
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:54,708
the next thing I knew I was just

77
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:56,659
standing in the middle of the kitchen I

78
00:02:54,709 --> 00:02:58,159
think that's a good sign

79
00:02:56,659 --> 00:03:00,049
that means the concentrates are working

80
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:02,329
when you're not sure why you're in a

81
00:03:00,049 --> 00:03:04,010

140
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,290
forward with the podcast I have got

141
00:05:03,769 --> 00:05:08,959
great news if you used to listen to a

142
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:12,319
podcast called the spliff podcast that's

143
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:15,829
the spliff SPL iff and it is the podcast

144
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:17,930
P ot CAS T the spliff podcast hosted by

145
00:05:15,829 --> 00:05:20,120
bone Ellis if you were a fan of that

146
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:21,650
you'd probably probably been missing the

147
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,389
show she's been gone for quite a while

148
00:05:21,649 --> 00:05:26,060
but I've got good news

149
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:27,740
BOE is back in podcasting she put out an

150
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:29,780
episode a couple of days ago and it was

151
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:31,850
wonderful it was so great to hear Bo's

152
00:05:29,779 --> 00:05:33,439
voice as soon as I heard that intro

153
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:35,320
music I got a smile on my face I hit

154
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:37,279
play and I heard the little guitar piano

155
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:39,469
family and I was like ah there she is

156
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:41,509
she's back those drums come in and then

157
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:44,630
she's like hey everybody it's so good to

158
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:46,219
hear her voice um I love Bo's podcast it

159
00:05:44,629 --> 00:05:48,350
is a completely different style of

160
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:50,210
podcasting than what I deliver it is a

161
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:51,800
completely different format it is

162
00:05:50,209 --> 00:05:53,000
cannabis-based yes but she has a

163
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,970
completely different approach to

164
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,069
cannabis than I do she talks more about

165
00:05:55,970 --> 00:06:01,010
the effects and more about the

166
00:05:58,069 --> 00:06:02,959
California scene and also she's a woman

167
00:06:01,009 --> 00:06:06,050
so there's a different approach just in

168
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:07,459
the tone of the show um I've got this

169
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:09,430
dude voice right I've got a lot of

170
00:06:07,459 --> 00:06:11,389
energy she kind of talks like a

171
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:13,250
kindergarten teacher and I say that with

172
00:06:11,389 --> 00:06:15,800
all due respect though I love your show

173
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:17,600
I love it because it feels like my

174
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:20,180
preschool teacher or my kindergarten

175
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,040
teacher sitting on a little stool in the

176
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:23,930
class while I'm sitting indian-style and

177
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:25,610
she's like gather round class today

178
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:27,500
we're gonna learn about cannabinoids and

179
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:29,300
I love it and today we're gonna learn

180
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:31,670
about terpenes and I [ __ ] love the

181
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:33,590
way beau delivers her podcast I love her

182
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:34,939
product so big shot at the bow I'm glad

183
00:06:33,589 --> 00:06:37,039
you're back you guys if you're not

184
00:06:34,939 --> 00:06:39,019
listening to the spliff podcast you're

185
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,310
missing something and you should give it

186
00:06:39,019 --> 00:06:42,799
a chance

187
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:44,870
all right I think that's all we've got

188
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,520
before we can get into some emails I've

189
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:49,189
covered all the business I said shout

190
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:51,169
out to bow yeah you guys let's get into

191
00:06:49,189 --> 00:06:52,850
some emails I like to answer emails from

192
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:54,620
my listeners if you would like to send

193
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:57,020
me an email my email address is grow

194
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:59,389
from your heart at hotmail.com send me

195
00:06:57,019 --> 00:07:03,109
an email I may read your email on a

196
00:06:59,389 --> 00:07:04,550
future podcast so this one goes like

197
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:06,620
this also you guys when you send me an

198
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:08,180
email let me know if you want me to say

199
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:09,980
your name on the show or not because

200
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:12,410
oftentimes I don't know if I'm supposed

201
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:14,000
to say your name and I'd like to if you

202
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:15,290
want me to say your name I'd like to

203
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,970
give you a shout-out but I don't want to

204
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:18,890
call you out and get you in trouble also

205
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:21,320
make you uncomfortable or anything like

206
00:07:18,889 --> 00:07:23,360
that so let me know and I will follow

207
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:24,709
your guidance all right let's get right

208
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,090
into this email I apologize for that

209
00:07:24,709 --> 00:07:28,279
microphone sound here I'm trying to Mike

210
00:07:26,089 --> 00:07:32,869
out of my face so I can read this email

211
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:34,549
goes like this hey sir I oversee 288

212
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:37,370
plants in a drain to waste hydro

213
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:40,129
commercial grow our feed schedule has us

214
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:41,870
adding a and B every single day we are

215
00:07:40,129 --> 00:07:44,990
not allowed to change the schedule we

216
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:46,850
must follow it to 80 but for my own

217
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:49,069
personal grow should I assume that I

218
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:51,230
need to add a and B every single day add

219
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:54,800
a and B until the plants tell us it's

220
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:56,930
good then possibly every other day all

221
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,639
right if you're growing in cocoa I would

222
00:07:56,930 --> 00:08:01,459
recommend that you just keep giving it

223
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:03,589
nutrients every day cocoa does not hold

224
00:08:01,459 --> 00:08:05,180
on to the nutrients they fall right

225
00:08:03,589 --> 00:08:09,409
through there's a lot of science I could

226
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:11,870
go into on that with low cation exchange

227
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:13,189
an ionic bond but we're not gonna go

228
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:15,980
there that's just too much talk to

229
00:08:13,189 --> 00:08:18,019
confuse people um

230
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:20,509
nothing sticks to that cocoa so you do

231
00:08:18,019 --> 00:08:23,089
need to use a and B every day I would

232
00:08:20,509 --> 00:08:25,159
also use some sort of a booster um

233
00:08:23,089 --> 00:08:27,379
you're gonna need cal-mag in there if

234
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:29,060
you're in flower you're gonna need a

235
00:08:27,379 --> 00:08:31,310
bloom booster you're also gonna need

236
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:33,979
maybe some epsom salts once a week so I

237
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:35,539
would do a and B every day and then I

238
00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:37,100
would make a list of the boosts that

239
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:39,769
you're gonna use like if you're gonna

240
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:42,610
use a bloom booster a sweetener I like

241
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:45,049
some carbs some enzymes some silicates

242
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:48,259
maybe a root inoculate maybe some

243
00:08:45,049 --> 00:08:50,179
cal-mag and possibly some epsom salts I

244
00:08:48,259 --> 00:08:52,340
would make a list of that stuff and on

245
00:08:50,179 --> 00:08:53,659
day one feed at the top of that list

246
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:55,700
you've got your a and B plus your

247
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:58,429
cal-mag on day two you've got your a and

248
00:08:55,700 --> 00:09:00,170
B plus your enzymes on day three got

249
00:08:58,429 --> 00:09:01,669
your a and B plus your bud booster and

250
00:09:00,169 --> 00:09:03,079
just go down that list and I'm gonna get

251
00:09:01,669 --> 00:09:04,819
to the bottom go back up to the top and

252
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,110
just cycle through that list and then

253
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:07,730
that way you can add some other things

254
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:09,139
to it instead of just the a and B and

255
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:10,909
that way you're not overdosing them or

256
00:09:09,139 --> 00:09:12,199
over feeding them anything if you want

257
00:09:10,909 --> 00:09:14,389
to mix a few things in there you can

258
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:17,379
makes what they need but I would give it

259
00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:19,580
a and B every single day if there's not

260
00:09:17,379 --> 00:09:21,860
nutrient if there are not nutrients in

261
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:23,509
the soil or in the cocoa the plants

262
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:27,710
can't eat and if they can't eat they're

263
00:09:23,509 --> 00:09:30,049
not producing to their highest level as

264
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:31,670
long as you are P aging everything and

265
00:09:30,049 --> 00:09:33,529
you're not getting a salt build-up and

266
00:09:31,669 --> 00:09:35,750
you're not over feeding you should be

267
00:09:33,529 --> 00:09:37,009
able to feed a and B every day now there

268
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:40,490
is a second part of the email that I

269
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:42,649
need to address he says also the ph

270
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:44,960
window i usually work with is five point

271
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:47,629
eight to six point two we are told that

272
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:49,250
we must and he put must in capitals so

273
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:51,980
they [ __ ] mean it we were told that

274
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:54,950
we must fluctuate by point one every

275
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:58,039
single day is it a benefit to hit every

276
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:59,870
ph point or just keeping pH at six is

277
00:09:58,039 --> 00:10:05,599
good to go

278
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:07,610
I would stick with 6.3 or 6.4 you're a

279
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,860
little bit too low at five point eight

280
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:13,100
to six point two I would come up I would

281
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:14,839
go six two at my lowest and six five at

282
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:17,540
my absolute highest but I would rather

283
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:20,360
be at six point three or six point four

284
00:10:17,539 --> 00:10:23,419
we mix a lot of nutrients at my large

285
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:28,970
facilities I run two grows for three

286
00:10:23,419 --> 00:10:33,019
rivers and we mix 150 about 200 another

287
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:35,060
180 ish like 350 450 500 something

288
00:10:33,019 --> 00:10:36,860
gallons there's 500 something gallons of

289
00:10:35,059 --> 00:10:39,259
flowering nutrients mixed in one room

290
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:42,200
and then easily 500 gallons mixed in

291
00:10:39,259 --> 00:10:43,970
another and we get the pH to six point

292
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,950
three or six point four whatever we

293
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:46,278
designate we dial it in on the [ __ ]

294
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:48,890
money

295
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:51,528
so it's not that hard you have to have a

296
00:10:48,889 --> 00:10:53,569
pH pin and some patience and a bottle of

297
00:10:51,528 --> 00:10:56,088
pH down it's gonna start off too high

298
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:58,250
put in a cap full give it a good stir

299
00:10:56,089 --> 00:10:59,750
test it see what happens now start

300
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:02,179
putting in drops until you get where you

301
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:04,789
want it go slow and get it to six three

302
00:11:02,179 --> 00:11:07,549
or six four don't overdo it

303
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:08,599
all right now I would move the pH up

304
00:11:07,549 --> 00:11:10,309
that's the first thing I would do now

305
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:13,670
you're told that you must fluctuate by

306
00:11:10,309 --> 00:11:16,250
0.1 every single day why I want to know

307
00:11:13,669 --> 00:11:18,860
why they think that why why do you need

308
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:20,389
fluctuation plants love consistency we

309
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:22,550
are building automated systems we're

310
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:24,470
building all these things on timers

311
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:25,819
everything is attached to a timer

312
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:27,290
everything has got some sort of a

313
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:29,120
schedule we show up at a certain time

314
00:11:27,289 --> 00:11:32,509
you eat breakfast at a certain time you

315
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:34,639
get lunch at a certain time consistency

316
00:11:32,509 --> 00:11:37,549
is key I'm not sure why we would change

317
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:39,470
the pH by 0.1 every single day there is

318
00:11:37,549 --> 00:11:41,659
no benefit to that in my opinion I don't

319
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:43,879
see the reason I would adjust it to the

320
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:45,949
proper pH where the plants can absorb

321
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:48,409
the nutrients and everything worked well

322
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:50,600
on purpose every day why would you

323
00:11:48,409 --> 00:11:53,120
change that so without trying to go too

324
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,440
far into pH I kind of want to I don't

325
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,480
have any notes on this I wasn't gonna

326
00:11:54,440 --> 00:12:00,850
rant on this this is a side rant this is

327
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:03,339
a general idea of how pH works

328
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:06,730
certain nutrients are available to the

329
00:12:03,339 --> 00:12:10,959
plants at certain pH levels so if you

330
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:12,220
drew a like a half circle chart I guess

331
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:13,958
we'd go the other way to go up you've

332
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:15,278
got an up graph a graph that's a half

333
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:16,838
circle so it looks like a sunrise right

334
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:20,289
you got the sunrise a half circle going

335
00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:22,870
up some nutrients are absorbable at pH

336
00:12:20,289 --> 00:12:26,318
around 5/8 some nutrients are most

337
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:28,000
absorbable at pH around 6.8 we have

338
00:12:26,318 --> 00:12:30,610
found that almost everything will be

339
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,740
absorbed right around 6.2 that's where

340
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:34,539
you can get everything you may not get

341
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:35,860
one nutrient the best you may not get

342
00:12:34,539 --> 00:12:38,500
the other nutrient the best but you'll

343
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:41,620
get everything efficiently everything at

344
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:42,970
six point two six point three six point

345
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:44,948
four that's when you start getting at

346
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:46,959
all if you go too high some things

347
00:12:44,948 --> 00:12:48,969
aren't available if you go too low other

348
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:51,159
things are not available everything is

349
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:54,278
efficiently available around six three

350
00:12:51,159 --> 00:12:56,318
that's why we lock it in there now also

351
00:12:54,278 --> 00:12:58,838
here's what's gonna happen your plants

352
00:12:56,318 --> 00:13:00,939
are going to go from freshly water we're

353
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:02,649
gonna call that freshly water that's

354
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:04,720
heavy right that's as wet as they're

355
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:07,240
gonna get now your pH is gonna be at one

356
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,100
state now when you leave they're gonna

357
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:12,310
start drying up and as they get drier

358
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:15,579
the pH is going to change the pH level

359
00:13:12,309 --> 00:13:18,278
in your Coco in your rhizosphere is

360
00:13:15,578 --> 00:13:20,888
constantly changing based on the amount

361
00:13:18,278 --> 00:13:23,198
of moisture based on the temperature the

362
00:13:20,889 --> 00:13:25,568
amount of oxygen that is all affecting

363
00:13:23,198 --> 00:13:28,389
your pH inside your rhizosphere that

364
00:13:25,568 --> 00:13:31,120
stands for potential hydrogen so think

365
00:13:28,389 --> 00:13:33,310
about if you've got your pot let's find

366
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,259
a vessel if this is your pot this is

367
00:13:33,309 --> 00:13:37,929
where all of your cocoa is you stick a

368
00:13:35,259 --> 00:13:40,120
meter in there there's so much potential

369
00:13:37,929 --> 00:13:42,698
hydrogen now watch if I add this pen I

370
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:44,779
have already changed your amount of

371
00:13:42,698 --> 00:13:46,219
potential hydrogen because

372
00:13:44,779 --> 00:13:48,230
you had if this was a hundred percent

373
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:51,350
full of hydrogen not anymore because you

374
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:53,240
have to deduct for the pen so every I

375
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:54,800
should have put something wet in here so

376
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,840
that it could dry if I spit into here

377
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:58,899
we've just changed the pH now as my spit

378
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:01,070
dries up you can see the amount of space

379
00:13:58,899 --> 00:14:02,899
disappearing that my spit is taking up

380
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:04,910
so the pH will change the water is going

381
00:14:02,899 --> 00:14:06,829
to do that the moisture is going to do

382
00:14:04,909 --> 00:14:10,159
that the pH is going to change in your

383
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:13,009
rhizosphere constantly so you make it at

384
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:15,439
6-3 and as it fluctuates it will do that

385
00:14:13,009 --> 00:14:17,389
point one adjustment for you as time

386
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,790
goes on I hope that made sense the way

387
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:22,220
that I did that um I took a container

388
00:14:19,789 --> 00:14:23,629
dropped a pen lid into it you can't have

389
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,920
as much hydrogen in there because now

390
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:27,470
you're taking up space from the lid

391
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:29,449
right so that's what the oxygen does

392
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:31,550
that's what the water does it changes

393
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:32,870
the pH in your rhizosphere I hope that

394
00:14:31,549 --> 00:14:35,959
makes sense the way I said it so no

395
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:38,659
there is no benefit to changing your pH

396
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:41,960
every day consistency is key in a large

397
00:14:38,659 --> 00:14:44,779
scale grow man congratulations on the

398
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:46,550
position in a 288 plant drained away

399
00:14:44,779 --> 00:14:48,639
system that's cool I'm glad you were

400
00:14:46,549 --> 00:14:51,229
able to get yourself into the industry

401
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,639
yes you do need to feed a and B every

402
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:56,659
day and I would work some other things

403
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:58,850
into there and do not fluctuate your pH

404
00:14:56,659 --> 00:15:02,809
so much and try to get it closer to 6-3

405
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:04,220
that's what I would do all right I know

406
00:15:02,809 --> 00:15:06,439
that you're not able to change that in

407
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:08,750
your commercial grow maybe you can just

408
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:10,220
put this podcast on and put it on repeat

409
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:11,750
and maybe the people that are in charge

410
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:14,180
will walk by and they'll hear that and

411
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:15,830
then ask them why do I want it to

412
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:17,809
fluctuate I would ask why are you a

413
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:18,860
person that asks why don't be afraid you

414
00:15:17,809 --> 00:15:20,509
look like you're trying to learn just

415
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:22,669
like hey why do I want to do it

416
00:15:20,509 --> 00:15:24,620
differently every day something that I

417
00:15:22,669 --> 00:15:26,839
like in a large facility is to train

418
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:29,240
everybody to do everything the same way

419
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:31,129
every day because I'm off for the next

420
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,870
two days I will not be there but I need

421
00:15:31,129 --> 00:15:34,730
to know that the things are happening

422
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:36,980
the same way that they would if I were

423
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:38,389
there I just need to know that it's

424
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:40,399
happening so we train everybody to do

425
00:15:38,389 --> 00:15:42,139
everything the same every day we take

426
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,759
notes we write it down we use Google

427
00:15:42,139 --> 00:15:45,409
Documents I know what everybody fed

428
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,850
every plant today because there's a

429
00:15:45,409 --> 00:15:50,089
Google spreadsheet that says hey I gave

430
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:51,509
room a this I gave room B this we try to

431
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:52,829
keep track

432
00:15:51,509 --> 00:15:56,220
so I don't see why you would want to

433
00:15:52,828 --> 00:15:58,048
vary and deviate keep it [ __ ]

434
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:59,819
consistent so much better alright dude

435
00:15:58,048 --> 00:16:00,899
thanks for the great email you guys once

436
00:15:59,818 --> 00:16:02,969
again if you'd like to send me an email

437
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:05,100
my email address is grow from your heart

438
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:07,678
at hotmail.com I would love to answer

439
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:09,689
your emails ask me some questions

440
00:16:07,678 --> 00:16:11,249
alright here's another email this person

441
00:16:09,688 --> 00:16:13,409
does not say if they want me to use

442
00:16:11,249 --> 00:16:15,569
their email or say their name or not

443
00:16:13,409 --> 00:16:17,399
anyway the email goes like this top of

444
00:16:15,568 --> 00:16:19,948
the day to you Rasta Jeff question for

445
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:22,499
you which way do you personally prefer

446
00:16:19,948 --> 00:16:24,748
to trim wet or dry and would you mind

447
00:16:22,499 --> 00:16:27,209
explaining why I love the plant however

448
00:16:24,749 --> 00:16:29,220
I personally do not use these days I

449
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:31,558
grow for my family and friends I

450
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:33,569
appreciate your time and advice your

451
00:16:31,558 --> 00:16:35,730
podcast contains a plethora of knowledge

452
00:16:33,568 --> 00:16:38,338
and I enjoy tuning in thanks for all

453
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:40,678
that you do wow that's a lot of great

454
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:42,359
stuff right there first of all you are

455
00:16:40,678 --> 00:16:44,608
welcome thanks for noticing that I do a

456
00:16:42,359 --> 00:16:47,149
lot of stuff thanks for the compliment

457
00:16:44,609 --> 00:16:49,528
thanks for the email you're very welcome

458
00:16:47,149 --> 00:16:51,958
first he says or they say I don't know

459
00:16:49,528 --> 00:16:54,808
if this is a man or a woman or both

460
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:56,758
since its 2018 they say question for you

461
00:16:54,808 --> 00:16:58,048
which way do you personally prefer to

462
00:16:56,759 --> 00:17:01,079
trim wet or dry

463
00:16:58,048 --> 00:17:03,119
I prefer after many years of

464
00:17:01,078 --> 00:17:05,158
experimenting and wasting a lot of time

465
00:17:03,119 --> 00:17:08,130
I have learned that I prefer dry trim

466
00:17:05,159 --> 00:17:09,750
dry trim is it's easier it's more

467
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:12,000
efficient it's less time-consuming it's

468
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:15,028
less of a pain in the ass and in a

469
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,828
commercial environment it's more uh it

470
00:17:15,028 --> 00:17:18,028
makes a lot more sense and I'll explain

471
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:18,898
that I just want to make sure I cover

472
00:17:18,028 --> 00:17:21,179
the whole email

473
00:17:18,898 --> 00:17:22,918
I love the plant I love the plant too

474
00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:24,990
and I'm glad you're on our team you say

475
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:26,699
however I personally do not use these

476
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:27,838
days you grow for family and friends

477
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:29,130
hey that's cool you're not even

478
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:31,019
consuming the product but you've got a

479
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:33,600
passion for growing it that's awesome

480
00:17:31,019 --> 00:17:34,950
everybody needs a good grower then you

481
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:36,808
say you appreciate my time and advice

482
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:38,190
then you're very welcome I'm glad you

483
00:17:36,808 --> 00:17:40,138
you sent me an email to say thank you

484
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:41,460
and then you say the podcast contains a

485
00:17:40,138 --> 00:17:42,990
plethora of knowledge and you enjoy

486
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:45,028
tuning in dude that makes everything

487
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:47,339
worth it so I'm glad you were getting a

488
00:17:45,028 --> 00:17:50,759
plethora of knowledge keep tuning in now

489
00:17:47,339 --> 00:17:55,048
let's talk about why I prefer wet or dry

490
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:57,058
trim wet trim is kind of a crucial thing

491
00:17:55,048 --> 00:17:58,648
that's like we cut down the plant if

492
00:17:57,058 --> 00:18:00,658
we're gonna wet trim it we got a [ __ ]

493
00:17:58,648 --> 00:18:02,638
wet trim it now is the time you got to

494
00:18:00,659 --> 00:18:05,070
go you're under the gun there's no

495
00:18:02,638 --> 00:18:07,798
mistakes there's lots of pressure

496
00:18:05,069 --> 00:18:10,589
you can't stop until you're finished you

497
00:18:07,798 --> 00:18:12,388
just have to trim and then it's kind of

498
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:15,599
it's super sticky it's kind of a pain in

499
00:18:12,388 --> 00:18:17,638
the ass also yours it's so sticky I like

500
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:20,819
dry trimming the way that I like to do

501
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:22,528
it is just before harvest I will go take

502
00:18:20,819 --> 00:18:24,000
off all of the big leaves all the leaves

503
00:18:22,528 --> 00:18:25,980
with the pea deol they get snapped right

504
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,250
off the plant several days before

505
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:31,470
harvest then we continue flushing then

506
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:33,720
on harvest day cut down the plants and

507
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:36,179
hang them upside down now you've just

508
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:38,009
got plants hanging upside down they will

509
00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:40,559
start to get crunchy want this once the

510
00:18:38,009 --> 00:18:43,769
stems pop once they start popping when

511
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:47,339
you bend them crunch then I will put

512
00:18:43,769 --> 00:18:48,990
them into bins I will cut the main part

513
00:18:47,339 --> 00:18:50,490
of the stick out and then I'll leave a

514
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:52,409
bunch of stick in there but I'll put

515
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:56,819
them into big Rubbermaid or Tupperware

516
00:18:52,409 --> 00:18:58,740
bins ah they are 2 feet long by a foot

517
00:18:56,819 --> 00:19:00,658
wide and about 18 inches tall those are

518
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:02,370
the Rubbermaid bins I like to use I can

519
00:19:00,659 --> 00:19:05,278
fit a couple plants in there maybe 3 or

520
00:19:02,369 --> 00:19:07,048
4 plants the size I grow them so I put

521
00:19:05,278 --> 00:19:08,638
the dry plants in there I cut out a lot

522
00:19:07,048 --> 00:19:09,929
of the big stick but I leave some of it

523
00:19:08,638 --> 00:19:14,069
because there's moisture in there that's

524
00:19:09,929 --> 00:19:15,450
gonna come into play so I have excuse me

525
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:17,369
I have plants that kind of kind of snap

526
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:18,899
now they've gone into these Rubbermaid

527
00:19:17,369 --> 00:19:21,388
containers then I will put the lid on

528
00:19:18,898 --> 00:19:23,969
them it's a good idea to wrap them in

529
00:19:21,388 --> 00:19:25,709
butcher paper just put one good wrap of

530
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:27,350
butcher paper around a bevel absorb any

531
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:30,389
excess water that wants to come out

532
00:19:27,349 --> 00:19:32,759
that'll help you so lock him in there

533
00:19:30,388 --> 00:19:34,079
seal him up then once a day just go in

534
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:36,960
there and open that container and let

535
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:37,859
out all the funky air spin him around so

536
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,509
where the buds that were on the bottom

537
00:19:37,859 --> 00:19:42,148
are now on the top leave him open for a

538
00:19:39,509 --> 00:19:44,069
few minutes and close them again now

539
00:19:42,148 --> 00:19:46,739
you've got dried buds that are basically

540
00:19:44,069 --> 00:19:48,689
just drying and curing now you can go in

541
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:50,339
at any time and get one of those

542
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:51,659
Rubbermaid containers and just carry it

543
00:19:50,339 --> 00:19:54,119
out to the table and to start trimming

544
00:19:51,659 --> 00:19:55,740
you can dry trim that product whenever

545
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:57,418
it's gonna stay in there dried and cured

546
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:59,638
in stasis forever

547
00:19:57,419 --> 00:20:01,230
until it gets ridiculously dry but if

548
00:19:59,638 --> 00:20:03,329
you seal it up and put it in a room with

549
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:05,940
humidity control we keep it in a room

550
00:20:03,329 --> 00:20:08,398
with a dehumidifier and a humidifier on

551
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:10,860
they fight each other all day but we

552
00:20:08,398 --> 00:20:13,018
keep that room 50% humidity constantly

553
00:20:10,859 --> 00:20:14,819
you'll hear that dehumidifier click off

554
00:20:13,019 --> 00:20:17,548
and two seconds later here comes the

555
00:20:14,819 --> 00:20:18,629
humidifier like yep it hit 52% and then

556
00:20:17,548 --> 00:20:20,670
they battle and then a real good

557
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:23,340
to 49% the other one will come on so

558
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:25,050
it's constantly 50% in that room but

559
00:20:23,339 --> 00:20:26,789
that's what keeps our buds at just the

560
00:20:25,049 --> 00:20:29,430
right squishiness just the right texture

561
00:20:26,789 --> 00:20:30,869
we keep them in the container sealed but

562
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:32,310
a little bit about moisture exchanges

563
00:20:30,869 --> 00:20:34,559
you can't keep they're not all airtight

564
00:20:32,309 --> 00:20:37,440
so we keep them in that room and they

565
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:39,329
get perfect so we cut them down let them

566
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,309
get to where they snap once they snap we

567
00:20:39,329 --> 00:20:42,599
put them in the containers then you can

568
00:20:41,309 --> 00:20:43,889
just open them up and dry trim them

569
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:45,719
whatever you can cut the buds off the

570
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:47,070
sticks and you can trim them up by hand

571
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:49,110
you can hold the button your hand and

572
00:20:47,069 --> 00:20:50,609
knock this the leaves off with your

573
00:20:49,109 --> 00:20:51,839
thumb just use your thumb just like

574
00:20:50,609 --> 00:20:53,490
you're playing a video game or just use

575
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:55,259
a little like it's little thumb scissors

576
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:57,779
then just knock the leaves off it's not

577
00:20:55,259 --> 00:20:59,970
nearly as sticky it's not nearly as

578
00:20:57,779 --> 00:21:01,529
messy it's not as much of a pain in the

579
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:04,230
ass you won't go through as many gloves

580
00:21:01,529 --> 00:21:05,670
and also as you're dry trimming you can

581
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:07,019
take those dried buds and just throw

582
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:08,880
them right into the bag because that's

583
00:21:07,019 --> 00:21:10,170
ready for retail ready for packaging

584
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,820
ready for whatever you're gonna do with

585
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:13,200
it and then you've got this little pile

586
00:21:11,819 --> 00:21:15,029
of trim that you can turn into whatever

587
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,680
you're gonna do with that and you can

588
00:21:15,029 --> 00:21:18,210
weigh that finished product

589
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:19,890
as soon as you're done trimming it so if

590
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:21,720
you're paying your trimmer by weight if

591
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:24,450
you say hey I'll give you this much per

592
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:25,740
pound then he's got dry trim he's just

593
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:27,360
pulling it off trimming it up throw it

594
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:28,890
in a bucket trimming it off throw in a

595
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:30,179
bucket trim it off throw in a bucket and

596
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:32,160
then at the end of the day you can put

597
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:34,560
that dry product on the scale and you

598
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:36,720
can see how much they actually did trim

599
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:38,279
with wet product it's wet you don't know

600
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:41,970
how much is there that [ __ ] can dry up

601
00:21:38,279 --> 00:21:44,549
30 50 75 percent maybe 80% depending on

602
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:47,970
how soon before harvest it got watered

603
00:21:44,549 --> 00:21:50,639
so I like dry trim it's less of a rush

604
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:52,470
it's less of a fiasco it's less of

605
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,210
there's less pressure you don't have to

606
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:56,220
just you're not under the gun as much

607
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:57,930
there's not as much of a deadline with

608
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:59,250
the dry trim you can just seal them up

609
00:21:57,930 --> 00:22:00,810
in containers and as long as they're

610
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:02,130
sealed they're gonna stay the way that

611
00:22:00,809 --> 00:22:04,500
they are you can just trim em up when

612
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:05,850
you need them so maybe maybe you don't

613
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,380
have anywhere for that product to go

614
00:22:05,849 --> 00:22:08,819
maybe you don't have a patient that

615
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:10,320
needs it maybe you're not hustling it

616
00:22:08,819 --> 00:22:11,309
maybe you're not flipping it maybe you

617
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:12,750
don't have time to trim it you can just

618
00:22:11,309 --> 00:22:14,009
sit there dry it as long as it's sealed

619
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:15,990
up you can just sit there with the

620
00:22:14,009 --> 00:22:18,420
leaves on it so that's partly why I like

621
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:20,220
it and it's just less messy it's wet it

622
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:21,900
is not as sticky it's not as much of a

623
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:25,589
pain in the ass so that's why I prefer

624
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:27,870
dry trim it makes more sense to me Mike

625
00:22:25,589 --> 00:22:30,059
and I used to wet trim for hours and we

626
00:22:27,869 --> 00:22:31,349
would be at it all night wet trimming we

627
00:22:30,059 --> 00:22:32,940
would start trimming afterward

628
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:34,230
for whatever is you can't trim during

629
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:35,400
the day when everyone's around you gotta

630
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:36,870
wait till the night time when people are

631
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,309
kind of low key because it [ __ ]

632
00:22:36,869 --> 00:22:40,168
stinks and then you gotta be in it for

633
00:22:38,308 --> 00:22:42,690
hours so we'd start trimming in the

634
00:22:40,169 --> 00:22:44,490
evenings and we'd go until sunrise and

635
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:46,679
then try to go to work the next day a

636
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:48,630
half exhausted we wore ourselves out wet

637
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:50,730
trimming we would be super sticky we

638
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:52,169
would over trim because you trim it and

639
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:53,548
that blood dries up and it shrinks and a

640
00:22:52,169 --> 00:22:54,690
lot of those leaves you trimmed off what

641
00:22:53,548 --> 00:22:56,940
it just shrunk up you wouldn't even have

642
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:58,650
seen it anyway so yeah dried trim is

643
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:00,390
better in my opinion in most commercial

644
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:02,519
applications that are doing dry trim

645
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:04,710
because it's such a rush there's such a

646
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:06,538
deadline that's such a fiasco to do wet

647
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:08,759
trim so dry trim is the way to go in my

648
00:23:06,538 --> 00:23:10,349
opinion once those buds are dried and

649
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:12,150
trimmed up you can already weigh them

650
00:23:10,349 --> 00:23:13,288
also so that feels good it's a nice to

651
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:15,690
know it's like chip chip chip chip chip

652
00:23:13,288 --> 00:23:18,210
chip chip two pounds cool I did that it

653
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:20,100
just feels good I said two pounds don't

654
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:23,788
don't kill yourself if you can't trim

655
00:23:20,099 --> 00:23:24,990
two pounds in a day one is good I hope

656
00:23:23,788 --> 00:23:26,609
you could do two I hope so

657
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:28,409
but one is cool all right you guys I'm

00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,720
a lot easier to produce the YouTube

729
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:50,730

730

you about patreon if you feel like this

00:26:22,769 --> 00:26:26,940

747
00:26:24,539 --> 00:26:28,170
can go to patreon.com/scishow from your

financially contribute to the podcast I

755
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:42,029

756
00:26:40,019 --> 00:26:44,279
