35
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:14,530
heart podcast

36
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:16,879
[Music]

37
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:19,070
all right podcast rolled let's talk

38
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:21,709
about mother plants what do I mean by a

39
00:01:19,069 --> 00:01:23,618
mother plant a mother plant is a plant

40
00:01:21,709 --> 00:01:26,359
that I plan on keeping around

41
00:01:23,618 --> 00:01:28,909
perpetually and taking clones off of and

42
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:30,920
using those clones for my production I

43
00:01:28,909 --> 00:01:33,320
plan on keeping that mother plant in the

44
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:35,450
mother area or the veg room forever and

45
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:37,428
not flowering her and then I've got

46
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:39,228
those genetics around so that I can

47
00:01:37,429 --> 00:01:42,079
always grow that same strain then I've

48
00:01:39,228 --> 00:01:44,118
got reliable clones of something that

49
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:45,949
I've grown that is tested tried and true

50
00:01:44,118 --> 00:01:47,929
I know it's a female I know the potency

51
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:49,819
I know how long to flower I know what to

52
00:01:47,929 --> 00:01:51,799
feed it I know what not to do with it so

53
00:01:49,819 --> 00:01:53,840
a mother plant is a plant you keep

54
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:55,909
around with intentions of cutting clones

55
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,299
from it and growing that strain over and

56
00:01:55,909 --> 00:02:00,560
over again you can get a mother plant

57
00:01:58,299 --> 00:02:02,959
from just about any plant that you

58
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,549
acquire if it's tested and you like it

59
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:06,319
you can keep it as a mother plant

60
00:02:04,549 --> 00:02:07,909
maybe you got a clone from a dispensary

61
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:09,739
maybe you got a clone from your friends

62
00:02:07,909 --> 00:02:11,569
maybe you grew out a seed and you really

63
00:02:09,739 --> 00:02:14,030
liked it you can keep a clone of that

64
00:02:11,568 --> 00:02:15,979
alive forever and not flower it and you

65
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:18,890
can dedicate that as your mother plant

66
00:02:15,979 --> 00:02:21,199
so let's talk about keeping with other

67
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:23,629
plants and caring for your mother plant

68
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:26,119
one of the first things is keeping your

69
00:02:23,629 --> 00:02:28,609
mother plant in good soil I like to put

70
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:30,680
them in decent soil bagged soil from the

71
00:02:28,609 --> 00:02:32,329
gross store you don't have to buy the

72
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:34,159
most expensive soil these aren't going

73
00:02:32,329 --> 00:02:35,930
to be super high performing plants you

74
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:38,900
just want to keep them healthy I would

75
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:40,639
add about 50 percent perlite if what

76
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:42,769
you're buying isn't well aerated add

77
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:44,689
some perlite to it the big chunky

78
00:02:42,769 --> 00:02:46,459
perlite or the small perlite as long as

79
00:02:44,689 --> 00:02:49,009
you're putting a lot of air in there you

80
00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:52,310
will be okay so decent soil or a

81
00:02:49,009 --> 00:02:54,169
soilless mix like a peat based mix with

82
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:55,909
a lot of perlite for your mother plants

83
00:02:54,169 --> 00:02:58,068
and then you want a semi big pot I

84
00:02:55,909 --> 00:03:00,979
wouldn't go any smaller than a three

85
00:02:58,068 --> 00:03:02,449
gallon pot probably a five or maybe a

86
00:03:00,979 --> 00:03:04,429
seven but I know you don't have a lot of

87
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:05,750
space so if you have a three gallon

88
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:07,700
you're not gonna be able to keep that

89
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:09,669
mother plant around as long you're going

90
00:03:07,699 --> 00:03:12,530
to have to clone it and replace it

91
00:03:09,669 --> 00:03:14,268
eventually but if you can put it in a

92
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:16,068
five you can keep it alive for a little

93
00:03:14,269 --> 00:03:17,090
longer it's gonna start to get root

94
00:03:16,068 --> 00:03:19,339
bound and you're gonna have to do

95
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:21,408
something about that also I like those

96
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:23,658
air pots have you seen the pots that

97
00:03:21,408 --> 00:03:25,219
look like they are kind of like a waffle

98
00:03:23,658 --> 00:03:26,840
maker on the outside though

99
00:03:25,219 --> 00:03:28,939
are great for mother plants you can open

100
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,379
those up and you can prune those roots

101
00:03:28,939 --> 00:03:32,569
we'll talk about that in a little bit

102
00:03:30,379 --> 00:03:35,599
but I like a big pot either an air pot

103
00:03:32,569 --> 00:03:36,979
or a root pot or a big pot for a mother

104
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,479
plant because that plants gonna grow

105
00:03:36,979 --> 00:03:40,310
large and you need to get it big enough

106
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:42,049
to take however many clones your

107
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:43,370
production is going to be if it's six

108
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:44,510
because you're in Colorado or I guess

109
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:45,980
you'd be at five now if you've already

110
00:03:44,509 --> 00:03:48,139
got your mother it limits you down to

111
00:03:45,979 --> 00:03:50,329
five or if you're gonna run a production

112
00:03:48,139 --> 00:03:52,399
you need to get that many clones off of

113
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:54,469
these plants so you're gonna need a

114
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,599
large pot to grow the plant as large as

115
00:03:54,469 --> 00:03:58,189
you need it so we've got a large pot

116
00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:59,629
full of good soil with a bunch of

117
00:03:58,189 --> 00:04:02,629
perlite and you're gonna want to put

118
00:03:59,629 --> 00:04:04,370
your plant under 18 to 24 hours of light

119
00:04:02,629 --> 00:04:06,769
I like to have the mother plants under

120
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:08,569
18 to 24 hours of light some plants I've

121
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:10,159
noticed when they start to get root

122
00:04:08,569 --> 00:04:11,900
bound if they get a little bit big and

123
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,759
you've only got them under 18 or 20

124
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:15,740
hours of light they will try to otto

125
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:17,180
flower on you they'll get mad that their

126
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:18,799
root bound they'll get big enough and

127
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:23,030
they'll think hey it is time for me to

128
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:25,310
start flowering so to prevent that maybe

129
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:27,649
have a larger pot and also keep it on 24

130
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:29,300
hours of light a lot of people say that

131
00:04:27,649 --> 00:04:31,969
your plants need to sleep a good

132
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:33,740
compromise there is maybe 20 on and 4

133
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:35,360
off and see what starts to happen if

134
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:37,250
your plant starts to auto flower if you

135
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,230
see it making pistols and then it is

136
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:41,509
time to put that plant on 24 hours of

137
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:43,790
light and start feeding it a nice heavy

138
00:04:41,509 --> 00:04:45,978
veg veg nutrient with a lot of nitrogen

139
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:47,750
and then also maybe increase the amount

140
00:04:45,978 --> 00:04:49,579
of light that you're giving it and also

141
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:51,199
the duration of light you're giving it

142
00:04:49,579 --> 00:04:53,930
and that will bring it out of that

143
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:55,459
flowering phase back to veg for you so

144
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:57,650
if they do start to auto flower put them

145
00:04:55,459 --> 00:05:00,019
on 24 and keep them there that's gonna

146
00:04:57,649 --> 00:05:01,849
happen with more sativa dominant more

147
00:05:00,019 --> 00:05:03,649
tropical type strains they're not gonna

148
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:06,110
take as much light to flower you may

149
00:05:03,649 --> 00:05:10,310
have to keep them on 24 hours of light

150
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:13,009
so 18 to 24 maybe 18 on 6 off maybe 19

151
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:15,290
on 5 off maybe 20 on 4 off or maybe just

152
00:05:13,009 --> 00:05:17,300
go straight up 24 hours on and don't

153
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:19,669
ever give them darkness that is up to

154
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:21,500
you see what your plants respond to

155
00:05:19,668 --> 00:05:23,269
everything lights some likes time to

156
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,709
sleep but maybe your mother plants

157
00:05:23,269 --> 00:05:26,418
flower if you give them too much nap

158
00:05:24,709 --> 00:05:29,149
time maybe just a couple hours will work

159
00:05:26,418 --> 00:05:30,799
for you alright so we've got big pots

160
00:05:29,149 --> 00:05:33,049
filled with good soil we know how long

161
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,168
to keep the light on let's talk a little

162
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:38,810
bit about what to feed our mother plants

163
00:05:36,168 --> 00:05:41,060
if you're using bottled nutrients just

164
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:43,970
basic veg nutrients if you got the veg a

165
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:46,759
the veg be used that at the recommended

166
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:48,200
dosage every once a week or so you're

167
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:49,819
gonna want to add some cal-mag so you

168
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:52,159
don't get any cal-mag deficiencies and

169
00:05:49,819 --> 00:05:54,079
maybe add a little bit of kelp and then

170
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,250
when you're going to take clones when

171
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:57,319
you know that you're gonna take clones

172
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:59,180
in a couple of days maybe spray them

173
00:05:57,319 --> 00:06:00,889
with a kelp product and that will help

174
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:02,689
the plants with a little bit of vigor

175
00:06:00,889 --> 00:06:05,120
when you cut the clones so basic

176
00:06:02,689 --> 00:06:06,410
vegetarians maybe some microbes to keep

177
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,569
that root zone strong and everything

178
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:10,460
grown fast and then maybe a little bit

179
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:12,680
of cal-mag occasionally and then some

180
00:06:10,459 --> 00:06:14,870
kelp I whip the feed and then maybe kelp

181
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,819
is a foliar feed occasionally all you

182
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:19,220
really have to do is keep these plants

183
00:06:16,819 --> 00:06:20,599
strong and healthy I wouldn't give them

184
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:22,729
too much food because then they're gonna

185
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,430
grow too fast and they're gonna get out

186
00:06:22,728 --> 00:06:27,050
of control and that leads me into

187
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:29,750
topping and shaping for the maximum

188
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:31,699
amount of clones you should be able to

189
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:33,228
top plants at this point if you've been

190
00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:34,699
listening to the podcast for a long time

191
00:06:33,228 --> 00:06:36,500
we've talked about topping if you're not

192
00:06:34,699 --> 00:06:37,819
sure on how to top a plan I'll give a

193
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,199
quick talk on it cuz you're gonna need

194
00:06:37,819 --> 00:06:41,629
to know how to do this to make good

195
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,189
mother plants the first clone that you

196
00:06:41,629 --> 00:06:45,560
can take out of your plants is that main

197
00:06:43,189 --> 00:06:47,360
top your plants gonna grow up it's gonna

198
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:49,100
branch out it's gonna grow taller it's

199
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,810
gonna branch out again then that main

200
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:52,970
top is gonna get taller than everybody

201
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:54,918
grab that main top and take it down

202
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:56,330
follow it down with your hand and tell

203
00:06:54,918 --> 00:06:58,159
you bend it over and it looks like

204
00:06:56,329 --> 00:07:00,649
you've got a nice even canopy tour the

205
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,810
next four tops the next four branches

206
00:07:00,649 --> 00:07:04,819
they kind of come up to an even point if

207
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:06,560
you cut out that main top you'll be able

208
00:07:04,819 --> 00:07:08,689
to see where you can create a nice even

209
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,668
canopy of four big heads you'll take out

210
00:07:08,689 --> 00:07:12,889
that one big main stalk and you'll

211
00:07:10,668 --> 00:07:14,478
create four even tops and you've got a

212
00:07:12,889 --> 00:07:17,240
nice mother plant that's gonna create

213
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:19,009
four nice even tops I like to clone that

214
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,870
first one that's where my first clone

215
00:07:19,009 --> 00:07:23,060
comes from I put that in the cloner I

216
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:24,978
make that one root I put her in a small

217
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:25,610
pot then I flower at that and I see what

218
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:28,009
I've got

219
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:29,240
if that is a good plant then I keep it

220
00:07:28,009 --> 00:07:30,680
then I've already got a mother plant

221
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:33,139
ready to give me a bunch of clones for a

222
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:34,759
production run if it's a male I can

223
00:07:33,139 --> 00:07:36,050
throw that one away and I can throw away

224
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:37,370
the mother plant which I guess would

225
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:38,689
have been a father playing at that point

226
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:40,879
but it doesn't matter because they're

227
00:07:38,689 --> 00:07:41,750
going in the trash if it was a problem I

228
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:43,850
throw that one away

229
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:46,189
I throw it's a corresponding donor plant

230
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:47,599
away that first clone is the one that

231
00:07:46,189 --> 00:07:49,098
makes me decide if I want to run that

232
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:50,329
plant again or let's me know if I've got

233
00:07:49,098 --> 00:07:51,519
a boy or a girl or if I've got a

234
00:07:50,329 --> 00:07:53,978
problematic plant

235
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:55,839
and it also starts shaping the plan I've

236
00:07:53,978 --> 00:07:57,098
now taken the main stock out and I've

237
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:58,869
started shaping that plant to be a

238
00:07:57,098 --> 00:08:00,339
little bit wider so there's my first

239
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:02,379
clone off of my mother plant now I like

240
00:08:00,339 --> 00:08:04,179
to go to the bottom and those bottom

241
00:08:02,379 --> 00:08:05,649
branches not the weak shitty ones but

242
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:08,168
the first ones that are kind of stout

243
00:08:05,649 --> 00:08:10,209
they come up kind of far those become my

244
00:08:08,168 --> 00:08:11,859
next two clones so now I've got three

245
00:08:10,209 --> 00:08:14,469
clones already off of kind of a small

246
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:16,360
mother plant now those three clones at

247
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:18,250
least one of those is gonna live for me

248
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:20,259
and then I'll have something to grow or

249
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:22,598
sometimes I do the opposite sometimes I

250
00:08:20,259 --> 00:08:24,129
keep that clone as the next mother plant

251
00:08:22,598 --> 00:08:26,199
so that I've got something small to

252
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:27,699
start so that I've got some time I don't

253
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:29,259
need it right away so I've already got a

254
00:08:27,699 --> 00:08:30,939
crop in progress right so I'll take the

255
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:32,740
big plant that the clone came from and

256
00:08:30,939 --> 00:08:34,538
flower that big one since it's already

257
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:36,009
so grown out it kind of just depends on

258
00:08:34,538 --> 00:08:37,899
the situation and how much room I've

259
00:08:36,009 --> 00:08:40,059
gotten what my goal is which one I

260
00:08:37,899 --> 00:08:42,610
decided to keep either the clone or the

261
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:44,319
grown out plant then I decided which one

262
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:46,300
to flower based on my situation but

263
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,399
that's a good way to do it but now I've

264
00:08:46,299 --> 00:08:50,019
got three clones off of a very small

265
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,208
mother plant then you can let that plant

266
00:08:50,019 --> 00:08:53,708
grow and as those bottom branches start

267
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:55,179
growing out they'll reach up to the tops

268
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:58,509
and the tops will start reaching up to

269
00:08:55,179 --> 00:09:00,519
the lights take those tops out so find

270
00:08:58,509 --> 00:09:02,019
the main the top of the branch that you

271
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:03,490
want to make a clone and follow it down

272
00:09:02,019 --> 00:09:04,958
with your fingers and tell you hit that

273
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:06,278
intersection where there's a Wye and

274
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:08,289
right where there are two branches

275
00:09:06,278 --> 00:09:09,820
coming out there and you would cut out

276
00:09:08,289 --> 00:09:11,110
the peace sign part the part that makes

277
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:12,430
it a peace sign right if you follow your

278
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:13,570
finger down your the middle of the peace

279
00:09:12,429 --> 00:09:15,519
sign then you'll come to the

280
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:18,100
intersection where to come up then make

281
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,899
the peace sign cut that middle the peace

282
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:21,370
sign out and now you've got in the

283
00:09:19,899 --> 00:09:22,990
future those two that are sticking up

284
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:25,089
are gonna become the next two tops you

285
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:26,919
turn it out one top into two tops

286
00:09:25,089 --> 00:09:29,350
and now you're multiplying the tops on

287
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:31,389
your mother plant sometimes if you've

288
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:32,920
got extra time in the grow even if you

289
00:09:31,389 --> 00:09:34,838
don't need clones and the plants are

290
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:36,399
those mother plants are getting tall go

291
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:38,500
through there and cut them at those

292
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,328
intersections top them and make a nice

293
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:42,220
even hedge out of your mother plants and

294
00:09:40,328 --> 00:09:43,059
let them keep growing and then when you

295
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:45,459
do need clones

296
00:09:43,059 --> 00:09:49,419
off of one plant you could be able to

297
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:51,669
get 25 50 maybe even 75 to 100 clones

298
00:09:49,419 --> 00:09:54,250
off of one mother plant depending on how

299
00:09:51,669 --> 00:09:56,110
big the plant is what strain it is what

300
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:57,789
size pot it is what kind of light you've

301
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:59,949
got it under and how well you've been

302
00:09:57,789 --> 00:10:01,629
taking care of it and that kind of leads

303
00:09:59,948 --> 00:10:03,789
me into the next part I want to talk

304
00:10:01,629 --> 00:10:05,230
about the most important part about

305
00:10:03,789 --> 00:10:07,509
mother plants is just

306
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:09,279
keeping them healthy and clean you need

307
00:10:07,509 --> 00:10:11,590
healthy and clean mother plants because

308
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:13,659
that is the foundation of your garden

309
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:15,370
everything starts with those plants if

310
00:10:13,659 --> 00:10:17,139
you've got spider mites on your mother

311
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:19,149
plants guess what your clones have

312
00:10:17,139 --> 00:10:20,620
spider mites now your veg plants will

313
00:10:19,149 --> 00:10:22,269
have spider mites now your flowering

314
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:24,310
plants before they even made it to the

315
00:10:22,269 --> 00:10:25,509
flower room they already are problems

316
00:10:24,309 --> 00:10:27,759
and you're struggling from the very

317
00:10:25,509 --> 00:10:30,100
beginning also if they're not healthy

318
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:31,480
and you take clones the clones are gonna

319
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,920
be weak they're gonna take longer to

320
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,389
root they're gonna be more prone to

321
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:36,399
disease they're gonna be more prone to

322
00:10:34,389 --> 00:10:38,019
powdery mildew they're gonna grow slower

323
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,120
you're not gonna get the production that

324
00:10:38,019 --> 00:10:41,740
you deserve out of these plants you're

325
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:43,179
gonna get everything dialed in and these

326
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:45,430
plants are still gonna grow like [ __ ]

327
00:10:43,179 --> 00:10:47,649
because the moms that they came from or

328
00:10:45,429 --> 00:10:49,629
not healthy you're cutting the arm off

329
00:10:47,649 --> 00:10:51,069
of the plant if you've got just think

330
00:10:49,629 --> 00:10:52,419
about this if you've got a body builder

331
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:54,100
and you cut the arm off of that body

332
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:55,149
builder and you stuck it into some [ __ ]

333
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:57,129
that made it grow roots you're gonna

334
00:10:55,149 --> 00:10:58,600
have a big fat healthy bodybuilder arm

335
00:10:57,129 --> 00:11:00,100
to start with it's gonna grow strong

336
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,420
it's gonna be able to lift weight it's

337
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:03,820
gonna be able to push it up it's gonna

338
00:11:01,419 --> 00:11:05,229
do well if you take some Harry Potter

339
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:06,640
arm and you cut it off and you stick it

340
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:08,170
into some clone [ __ ] you're gonna have

341
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:09,610
this toothpick arm it's not gonna make

342
00:11:08,169 --> 00:11:11,079
any weight it's not gonna be able to

343
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:13,450
support anything wouldn't you rather

344
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:15,520
start with the beefy bodybuilder arm so

345
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:17,680
start off with super healthy super happy

346
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:19,210
clean strong mother plants that's one of

347
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:22,329
the most important parts of a mother

348
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:24,460
plant keep it pest and problem free a

349
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:27,040
lot of people overlook the importance of

350
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:28,300
a healthy veg environment the veg room

351
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:30,370
is probably where you're keeping your

352
00:11:28,299 --> 00:11:33,069
mother plants spend the few extra bucks

353
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:34,629
and make that room as top-notch as your

354
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:35,860
flower room everybody spends all the

355
00:11:34,629 --> 00:11:38,620
money on the bloom room

356
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:41,019
don't forget the veg is super important

357
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:43,269
don't overlook that step all right let's

358
00:11:41,019 --> 00:11:45,340
talk a little bit about the lighting

359
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:47,230
that you can use for your mother plants

360
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:49,360
and you guys you can keep little tiny

361
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:51,310
mother plants if all you need is six

362
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,930
clones you can keep a little one gallon

363
00:11:51,309 --> 00:11:54,609
pot with a little tiny plant that gives

364
00:11:52,929 --> 00:11:56,259
you six little clones every time you

365
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:58,120
need them you can cut it back really

366
00:11:56,259 --> 00:12:00,129
tiny to where it's got one shoot on it

367
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:02,139
and let that one shoot grow into six

368
00:12:00,129 --> 00:12:03,970
clones by the time you need it again you

369
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:05,049
can keep them real tiny or you can keep

370
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:06,610
them real big that's something I should

371
00:12:05,049 --> 00:12:08,769
mention so let's talk about the lighting

372
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:10,389
you can keep them under a t5 if you

373
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:12,100
don't want them to get too big if you

374
00:12:10,389 --> 00:12:14,169
don't need giant mother plants you could

375
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:16,990
probably get plenty of clones by keeping

376
00:12:14,169 --> 00:12:19,289
your plants under a t5 if you don't want

377
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:21,330
them to grow super fast a t5 is I

378
00:12:19,289 --> 00:12:24,059
if you've got a home grow where you just

379
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:25,170
need clones every 60 days you just need

380
00:12:24,059 --> 00:12:27,479
to cut them to replace the batch that

381
00:12:25,169 --> 00:12:30,120
you're gonna cut down a t5 would be

382
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:32,460
perfect for you a t5 could also work for

383
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:34,289
you on a small commercial scale you

384
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:35,639
would just need a lot of them just have

385
00:12:34,289 --> 00:12:39,179
to spread the plants out a little bit

386
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:40,799
more they can't get as tall also 315 s

387
00:12:39,179 --> 00:12:42,659
the ceramic metal halide so you could

388
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:45,089
use those for your mother plants that

389
00:12:42,659 --> 00:12:46,469
would work just fine those are enough to

390
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:48,629
keep the plants growing keep them

391
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:50,250
vegging I would keep those on since they

392
00:12:48,629 --> 00:12:52,830
aren't as powerful the T fives in the

393
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:54,720
315 I would keep those on 24 hours a day

394
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:57,120
just because you're gonna need that much

395
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:00,450
power to make sure they do not auto

396
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:02,159
flower on you alright so the next light

397
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:04,379
that I would recommend maybe you could

398
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:07,289
use an LED I don't have any experience

399
00:13:04,379 --> 00:13:09,659
with LEDs but the LEDs make veg plants

400
00:13:07,289 --> 00:13:12,779
go crazy so for mother plants they would

401
00:13:09,659 --> 00:13:14,129
be highly productive then if you really

402
00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:15,779
want to step it up and you want to have

403
00:13:14,129 --> 00:13:17,279
larger mother plants and you want a lot

404
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:19,769
of productivity so that you can make a

405
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:22,919
lot of clones I would say a 400 watt

406
00:13:19,769 --> 00:13:24,840
metal halide would be very productive

407
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:26,819
and also the more light you're using the

408
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:28,649
healthier your plants are gonna be the

409
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:30,360
spider mites come around less when the

410
00:13:28,649 --> 00:13:32,879
light is better the plants get less

411
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:35,879
problems when the light is stronger so T

412
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:38,879
fives the 315 ceramic metal halides a

413
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:41,850
good quality LED or a 400 watt metal

414
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:43,769
halide you could use a 600 or 2000 watt

415
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:45,420
metal halide if you wanted to you could

416
00:13:43,769 --> 00:13:47,429
use a double-ended Gavita for a mother

417
00:13:45,419 --> 00:13:49,589
plant if you wanted to however those are

418
00:13:47,429 --> 00:13:52,139
kind of overkill the lights I listed

419
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:54,450
before are probably the most efficient

420
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:57,059
for somebody with a home grow maybe a

421
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:59,100
400 watt for a commercial grow would be

422
00:13:57,059 --> 00:14:00,750
good enough so that's the lighting

423
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:02,629
alright we know about soil we know about

424
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:05,129
pots we know how long to run the lights

425
00:14:02,629 --> 00:14:06,689
we learned about nutrients we talked

426
00:14:05,129 --> 00:14:08,100
about how to top and shape the plants

427
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:09,870
for production we know to keep them

428
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:12,300
healthy and keep the bugs away from the

429
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:14,009
plants we know what kind of lighting to

430
00:14:12,299 --> 00:14:16,529
use here's something we should talk

431
00:14:14,009 --> 00:14:17,879
about carefully label your mother plants

432
00:14:16,529 --> 00:14:21,059
if you're going to have more than one

433
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:23,129
mother plant please carefully label it

434
00:14:21,059 --> 00:14:25,289
there's nothing more frustrating than

435
00:14:23,129 --> 00:14:27,029
growing star dog for seven weeks and

436
00:14:25,289 --> 00:14:28,559
realizing about 7 weeks in that that's

437
00:14:27,029 --> 00:14:30,209
Romulan Kush and you've been thinking

438
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:31,778
all this time that all those pictures

439
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:33,160
you took were star dog and all the high

440
00:14:31,778 --> 00:14:35,379
you had in your head it was star dog and

441
00:14:33,159 --> 00:14:37,328
it's not even [ __ ] star dog that [ __ ]

442
00:14:35,379 --> 00:14:41,319
gets annoying so make sure you label the

443
00:14:37,328 --> 00:14:42,669
plants very carefully especially if you

444
00:14:41,318 --> 00:14:44,049
plan on giving clones out you don't want

445
00:14:42,669 --> 00:14:45,669
to give out clones that are mislabeled

446
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:47,979
so if you're gonna give out clones

447
00:14:45,669 --> 00:14:49,748
please label your mother plant label

448
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:50,949
your clones properly here's something

449
00:14:49,749 --> 00:14:53,709
that I didn't want write down that I

450
00:14:50,948 --> 00:14:55,328
want to mention ah pay attention to what

451
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:56,828
you spray on your plants this is your

452
00:14:55,328 --> 00:14:59,558
garden you're allowed to spray what you

453
00:14:56,828 --> 00:15:01,269
would like I would like if you were

454
00:14:59,558 --> 00:15:03,249
gentle and you didn't use ridiculous

455
00:15:01,269 --> 00:15:04,899
pesticides but if you're gonna give

456
00:15:03,249 --> 00:15:06,308
clones out from your mother plants if

457
00:15:04,899 --> 00:15:08,230
you're gonna give clones out to people

458
00:15:06,308 --> 00:15:10,899
let those people know what you applied

459
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:12,909
to your plants just be honest okay don't

460
00:15:10,899 --> 00:15:14,740
lie to people don't try to hide it also

461
00:15:12,909 --> 00:15:16,360
whatever you spray on these mother

462
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:17,769
plants is going into your veg plants

463
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,688
which is gonna end up in your flowering

464
00:15:17,769 --> 00:15:21,429
plants so think about who is going to

465
00:15:19,688 --> 00:15:23,379
consume this product if you've got a

466
00:15:21,429 --> 00:15:24,969
patient who has a compromised immune

467
00:15:23,379 --> 00:15:26,829
system if you've got a patient with the

468
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:28,689
lung problem if you've got a patient who

469
00:15:26,828 --> 00:15:30,099
is allergic to something keep that in

470
00:15:28,688 --> 00:15:32,110
mind when you were treating your mother

471
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,470
plants for pesticides all right all

472
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:34,149
right

473
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:36,189
sorry to rant on that all the time but I

474
00:15:34,149 --> 00:15:39,220
want to keep people safe and clean so

475
00:15:36,188 --> 00:15:40,659
where was I carefully label things label

476
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:42,040
your clones be honest about the

477
00:15:40,659 --> 00:15:43,480
pesticides that are put on your mother

478
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:45,789
plants if you're gonna share clones with

479
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:47,769
people then don't let your mother plants

480
00:15:45,789 --> 00:15:49,750
get root bound if your plants start to

481
00:15:47,769 --> 00:15:51,370
get root bound they may try to auto

482
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:53,169
flower on you that's one of the things

483
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:54,818
that will trigger that if they get root

484
00:15:53,169 --> 00:15:57,399
bound you've got a couple of options

485
00:15:54,818 --> 00:15:59,318
you can either a pot to a larger pot if

486
00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:01,629
you're in a one gallon pot put it in a

487
00:15:59,318 --> 00:16:03,338
three gallon pot it's not that hard I'm

488
00:16:01,629 --> 00:16:05,379
sure you know how to up pot you fill the

489
00:16:03,339 --> 00:16:07,480
pot about halfway you pull the pot off

490
00:16:05,379 --> 00:16:08,949
of the old dirt it's probably [ __ ]

491
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:10,360
real tight you just got to squeeze that

492
00:16:08,948 --> 00:16:12,490
pot off turn it upside down and shake it

493
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:14,079
get that pot off the dirt set it right

494
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:16,058
in the new dirt and fill it up with soil

495
00:16:14,078 --> 00:16:17,859
Pat it into where it's kind of snug and

496
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:19,299
then feed it with good nutrients

497
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:20,699
you've just up potted now you're into a

498
00:16:19,299 --> 00:16:22,958
bigger pot it won't be root bound

499
00:16:20,698 --> 00:16:24,698
something I would recommend if you've

500
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:26,859
got a root bound plant and you're trying

501
00:16:24,698 --> 00:16:28,568
to up hot it maybe crunch those roots up

502
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,829
a little bit if they're all bound up

503
00:16:28,568 --> 00:16:31,028
just put your fingers in there and just

504
00:16:29,828 --> 00:16:33,638
crunch them up and spread them apart

505
00:16:31,028 --> 00:16:35,409
encourage them to spread and stop them

506
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:37,329
from growing into a ball so if they're

507
00:16:35,409 --> 00:16:39,759
up if they're root bound up bottom or

508
00:16:37,328 --> 00:16:41,229
you can learn how to root prune I am

509
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:42,669
scared of root pruning that is not

510
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:44,589
something I do if you're gonna root

511
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:45,189
prune get yourself a pot that will air

512
00:16:44,589 --> 00:16:47,560
prune

513
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:50,500
it'll be a lot easier or your other

514
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:52,119
option you can simply clone off of your

515
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,830
mother plant you can make a bunch of

516
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:55,629
clones and as soon as you have one of

517
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:57,730
them rooted and into some soil you can

518
00:16:55,629 --> 00:17:00,549
just either throw that big mother plant

519
00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:02,259
away or you can flower it if it's got a

520
00:17:00,549 --> 00:17:03,969
decent shape if you haven't [ __ ] it up

521
00:17:02,259 --> 00:17:05,379
by taking so many clones off of it a lot

522
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:07,509
of times you guys your mother plants are

523
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:08,800
gonna start to get this ridiculous shape

524
00:17:07,509 --> 00:17:10,900
to them cuz you've been taking so many

525
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:12,399
clones some of the og cush plants grow

526
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,959
like [ __ ] so no matter what you do

527
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,089
they're gonna just start getting a weird

528
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:18,549
shape you're gonna have to re mom them

529
00:17:16,088 --> 00:17:20,559
there's no crime and taking a bunch of

530
00:17:18,549 --> 00:17:22,539
clones selecting your favorite clone and

531
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:24,458
restarting that one as your new mother

532
00:17:22,539 --> 00:17:26,019
plant then you can take that old one you

533
00:17:24,459 --> 00:17:27,400
can cut it down you can cut a bunch of

534
00:17:26,019 --> 00:17:28,660
clones off of it donate them to your

535
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:31,210
friends or you could just throw it away

536
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:33,730
or if it's in good shape like I said you

537
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:34,960
can flower that old mother plant a lot

538
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:36,370
of times I just cut them down at throw

539
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,350
them away because they're already a

540
00:17:36,369 --> 00:17:39,729
wonky shape it's not worth working out

541
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:41,919
with them just get as many clones as you

542
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:44,589
can and then just cut it down and let it

543
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:47,800
go um a lot of people are gonna say what

544
00:17:44,589 --> 00:17:50,230
about genetic drift I do not think that

545
00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:52,089
genetic drift would be a problem if you

546
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:54,160
were taking care of your mother plants

547
00:17:52,089 --> 00:17:55,859
properly if the mud this is why I talked

548
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,420
about keeping strong healthy

549
00:17:55,859 --> 00:18:00,459
problem-free mother plants if the mother

550
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:02,200
plants are healthy and the clones are

551
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:04,420
done properly and everything is cared

552
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:08,759
for there will not be genetic drift I

553
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:12,580
have had my clone of Flo since 2007 or

554
00:18:08,759 --> 00:18:14,859
2008 I have had the same plant it's not

555
00:18:12,579 --> 00:18:17,230
the same plant but it's the same clone I

556
00:18:14,859 --> 00:18:18,569
have regenerated that clone several

557
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:21,009
times because it's gotten too big

558
00:18:18,569 --> 00:18:22,389
imagine over eight years how big that

559
00:18:21,009 --> 00:18:25,180
[ __ ] clone has gotten I've had to

560
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:27,940
reclone it several times probably eight

561
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:29,289
times probably keep it probably twice a

562
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:31,420
year so it's probably been 16

563
00:18:29,289 --> 00:18:33,339
generations through and I just posted a

564
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:35,259
picture of Flo today and she is still

565
00:18:33,339 --> 00:18:37,089
beautiful so I don't really worry about

566
00:18:35,259 --> 00:18:39,220
genetic drift we don't worry about it in

567
00:18:37,089 --> 00:18:41,949
the commercial industry because if it's

568
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:43,180
done properly genetic drift has not been

569
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:44,650
a problem and I've been in the

570
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:46,120
commercial industry for several years

571
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:48,100
now I've been through several facilities

572
00:18:46,119 --> 00:18:50,309
I ran my clone like I said for eight

573
00:18:48,099 --> 00:18:52,299
years and it's still beautiful so

574
00:18:50,309 --> 00:18:54,369
genetic drift shouldn't be a problem if

575
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:56,470
things are done properly you guys I feel

576
00:18:54,369 --> 00:18:58,299
like that was a quick good useful

577
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:58,930
rundown on mother plants I feel like we

578
00:18:58,299 --> 00:19:01,059
covered all

579
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:02,920
things we need to cover we covered soil

580
00:19:01,059 --> 00:19:05,230
we covered pot size we covered light

581
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:06,880
schedule we talked about shaping your

582
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:08,470
plant we talked about strong veg

583
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,110
nutrients and a little bit of cal-mag

584
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:13,269
maybe some kelp we talked about keeping

585
00:19:11,109 --> 00:19:15,099
the plants healthy and clean don't be

586
00:19:13,269 --> 00:19:16,660
afraid to go in and pick off the bottom

587
00:19:15,099 --> 00:19:18,399
stuff if it starts getting funky because

588
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:19,810
it's not getting enough light pick off

589
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,759
that crap on the bottom that little

590
00:19:19,809 --> 00:19:23,109
frilly crap the pubes go ahead and pick

591
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:25,420
them right off yeah I call them the

592
00:19:23,109 --> 00:19:26,949
pubes I'm sorry um we talked about

593
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:28,090
lighting you don't need the strongest

594
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:29,380
lights on the planet for your mother

595
00:19:28,089 --> 00:19:30,970
plants you just need to keep them

596
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:32,770
growing of course the more light you

597
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:34,450
give them the healthier they will be the

598
00:19:32,769 --> 00:19:36,009
more healthy they will be whichever and

599
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:37,779
also the more clones you'll be able to

600
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:39,569
take but that's all about the size of

601
00:19:37,779 --> 00:19:41,529
your grow and your requirements

602
00:19:39,569 --> 00:19:42,669
carefully label all of your mother

603
00:19:41,529 --> 00:19:44,740
plants if you've got more than one

604
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:46,509
mother plant please carefully label that

605
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:50,049
if you're gonna give out clones please

606
00:19:46,509 --> 00:19:51,519
carefully label those also be honest

607
00:19:50,049 --> 00:19:52,930
about the pesticides that you're using

608
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:55,450
on your mother plants because they're

609
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:57,370
making it through the entire cycle um

610
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:59,080
don't let them get rootbound you're

611
00:19:57,369 --> 00:20:01,809
gonna have to learn to up pot root prune

612
00:19:59,079 --> 00:20:04,240
or reclone your mother plants and when

613
00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:05,859
you do so if you reclone don't worry

614
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,940
about genetic drift because Rasta Jeff

615
00:20:05,859 --> 00:20:08,679
says if you do it right

616
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:10,390
that's not even anything to worry about

617
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,650
ladies and gentlemen thanks for

well alright you guys

628
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:32,380
wrapping up the podcast hey up before

629
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:34,210
you start tweeting me I know that the

630
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:35,680
numbers got out of order I recorded the

631
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:37,809
other episode and then I decided hey

632
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:39,460
let's put out a Sunday bonus episode so

633
00:20:37,809 --> 00:20:41,589
the numbers will be out of order until

634
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:43,870
number suit 216 comes out but I'm sure

635
00:20:41,589 --> 00:20:46,240
we will survive it's just some labels

636
00:20:43,869 --> 00:20:48,129
don't let babylon numbers mess with your

637
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,599
head man we're gonna be okay

638
