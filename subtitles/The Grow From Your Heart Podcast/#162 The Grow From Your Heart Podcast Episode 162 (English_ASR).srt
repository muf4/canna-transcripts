dabs in the dab rig that I've got from

00:01:23,239 --> 00:01:26,869
your mouth kind of do the kissy face and

36
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:29,240

38
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:35,239

39
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:36,770
this sticky dad waxing my mustache back

40
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:38,539
in the day I'm ranting now but back in

41
00:01:36,769 --> 00:01:40,759
the day I used to go to the clinic in

42
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:43,850
Denver and they sold this Durbin poison

43
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:45,320
wax and it had the best high I loved it

44
00:01:43,849 --> 00:01:46,908
but after you would smoke it if you put

45
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:49,250
your teeth together they would stick

46
00:01:46,909 --> 00:01:51,290
together a little bit for some reason I

47
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:54,079
loved it sit there just stick my teeth

48
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:58,368
together and pull apart it just do it

49
00:01:54,079 --> 00:02:00,978
over it was almost like you took a bite

50
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:03,200
of a crown kind of but for some reason I

51
00:02:00,978 --> 00:02:04,969
loved the texture the way I'm weird

52
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,280

maybe one day get back into it do you

66
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:34,010

I do miss huge smile when we started

68
00:02:34,009 --> 00:02:37,039
talking about it yeah whenever I go cuz

69
00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:39,620
I have some friends that still do it and

70
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:43,310
if I go to their house or whatever I get

71
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:44,629
in studio kind of like yeah your fingers

72
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:46,310
start spinning yeah I'm always just like

73
00:02:44,629 --> 00:02:47,780
man I want to kind of I can hop behind a

74
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:49,879
torch but they're not blowing glass so I

75
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:54,349
don't wanna like right in truth that gas

76
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:55,729
is so expensive exactly you think you

77
00:02:54,349 --> 00:02:58,430
still got the spin technique mastered

78
00:02:55,729 --> 00:02:59,959
like to think I do but you know I don't

79
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:01,370
know if it's like riding a bike or not

80
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,629
I'd have to come right now because I

81
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:04,879
mean I would take like a couple days off

82
00:03:02,629 --> 00:03:07,909
and I'd get noticed a difference yeah

83
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:09,590
I've got these big humbly bookie hands

84
00:03:07,909 --> 00:03:12,079
and I can't so when you're blowing glass

85
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:14,840
you guys I do not I know very very

86
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,040
little about making glass but when

87
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,750
you're blowing glass you got to turn it

88
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:19,009
you have to turn your right hand in your

89
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,449
left hand at the same time and you got

90
00:03:19,009 --> 00:03:21,500
to have the torch in the middle ish or

91
00:03:20,449 --> 00:03:23,089
whatever section you're heating

92
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:25,520
and if one hand spins faster than the

93
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:27,349
other here it starts twisting and if you

94
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:29,990
one hand goes higher than the other your

95
00:03:27,349 --> 00:03:32,840
piece starts bending and there's a flame

96
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:34,159
in front of you and it's hot and your

97
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,599
muscles start twitching because these

98
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,189
are doing the same thing so it's kind of

99
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:40,099
a pain in the ass but so shout out to

100
00:03:37,189 --> 00:03:42,560
the people who do you know twist yeah

101
00:03:40,099 --> 00:03:45,909

103
00:03:45,909 --> 00:03:50,659
sure you will let's uh let's talk about

104
00:03:48,289 --> 00:03:51,919
your new venture now one of the things

105
00:03:50,659 --> 00:03:53,599
that I wrote down that I wanted to make

106
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:56,299
sure we cover is that you went from a

107
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:58,639
basement grow to a large facility in a

108
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:00,410
very short time so how long did you're

109
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:03,469
from North Carolina right yes did you

110
00:04:00,409 --> 00:04:05,240
grow ganja in North Carolina I did I

111
00:04:03,469 --> 00:04:07,789
kind of like I did it for a few years

112
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:10,100
there not successfully for the first

113
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:12,429
year tried in Asheville and just failed

114
00:04:10,099 --> 00:04:15,229
miserably got into flower and then like

115
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:16,819
sprayed cal-mag on the plants as a

116
00:04:15,229 --> 00:04:18,048
foliar one day and like totally like

117
00:04:16,819 --> 00:04:19,310
just I don't really don't know what I

118
00:04:18,048 --> 00:04:21,829
was thinking it was one of those just

119
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:25,129
had no nobody to ask no nothing to do

120
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:27,228
and thought that was how I don't know so

121
00:04:25,129 --> 00:04:28,519
killed those plans you learned yeah

122
00:04:27,228 --> 00:04:30,740
exactly

123
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:33,198
and then when I lived in Charlotte I had

124
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:34,460
an apartment and I gotta tend to start

125
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:39,800
growing on my closet actually got some

126
00:04:34,459 --> 00:04:41,418
genetics so some some I read genetics so

127
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:44,930
this could've been too long ago no it

128
00:04:41,418 --> 00:04:45,769
was about let's see I've been here for

129
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:47,360
about a year and a half so it'd have

130
00:04:45,769 --> 00:04:48,649
been about two and a half years okay

131
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,819
yeah all right there's gonna be one of

132
00:04:48,649 --> 00:04:52,638
my next questions is how long you been

133
00:04:49,819 --> 00:04:57,439
here yeah so you grew in Charlotte then

134
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:59,590

135
00:04:57,439 --> 00:04:59,589

there and how sketchy is that growing in

146
00:05:19,459 --> 00:05:23,718
North Carolina uh it's pretty sketchy I

147
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:26,478
think the way I was doing it I mean I

148

00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:30,769
was a really low key okay didn't put up

150
00:05:28,908 --> 00:05:32,899
a lot heat I had four little plants in

151
00:05:30,769 --> 00:05:35,930
my in a little tin I was like a two by

152
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:37,968
four ten I think that's pretty small but

153
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:39,288
if I was doing like a basement grow or

154
00:05:37,968 --> 00:05:42,408

00:07:38,069 --> 00:07:43,980
it's not uncommon to see like every

208
00:07:40,709 --> 00:07:46,109
plant hit a half pound Wow how often in

209
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:48,420
the summer at peak harvest are at peak

210
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:50,639
flowering how often to those plants need

211
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:52,439
to be watered we water every other day

212
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,430
sometimes the plants like in the center

213
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:55,649
of the greenhouse where they get more

214
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:56,790
Sun and more light every single day Wow

215
00:07:55,649 --> 00:07:57,959
in the middle of the summer yeah we had

216
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:58,950
a lot of we had a couple beds we were

217
00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:00,299
hitting every single day this do you

218
00:07:58,949 --> 00:08:02,339
know how many gallons of water you're

219
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:03,960
throwing in a twenty gallon pot it's

220
00:08:02,339 --> 00:08:06,799
around two and a half gallons per I

221
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:11,120
believe I honestly expected more maybe

222
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:13,620
but we have 300 gallons for 120 plants

223
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:16,050
every other day okay so because it's -

224
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:18,810
we our bed has 160 plants in its - in a

225
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:20,879
fraction I'm not gonna try to diagnose

226
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:23,160
and turn to look at you I'm not gonna do

227
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,860
that much math alright so is that like a

228
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:27,510
good solid eight to ten hours of work

229
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:30,330
like every day yeah yeah basically we

230
00:08:27,509 --> 00:08:32,939
were there every single day from 7

231
00:08:30,329 --> 00:08:35,098
o'clock until on a good day we got at 4

232
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:36,419
or 4:30 nice and that's every single day

233
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:40,349
plus like a little bit of a drive

234
00:08:36,418 --> 00:08:42,569
because it's not right in town it's

235
00:08:40,349 --> 00:08:44,009
beautiful spots I went for a drive I

236
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:46,530

239
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,659
toward the castle and we went to the

240
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:54,120
castle luckily we went before the fires

241
00:08:51,659 --> 00:08:55,769

244
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:59,639
feel so bad for you my whole vibe just

245
00:08:58,139 --> 00:09:01,680
changed when I thought about it but we

246
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:03,480
went out there and there are so if

247
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:05,489

248
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:07,050
grows out there there's a grow every

249
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:08,970
five miles off to the left to the right

250
00:09:07,049 --> 00:09:10,649
side of the interstate some of them are

251
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:11,490
super high-tech and fancy some one were

252
00:09:10,649 --> 00:09:13,740
a little jank

253
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:17,250
but there are so many grows out there

254
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:19,589
from from Pueblo to all the way into

255
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:21,600
almost to the castle there's a grow on

256
00:09:19,589 --> 00:09:23,010

265
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:40,079
and look at all of the grows on the left

266

269
00:09:44,509 --> 00:09:48,750
alright so one thing I want to talk

270
00:09:46,379 --> 00:09:50,159
about you started off in a basement grow

271
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:52,379
like most growers do you start off in a

272
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:54,088
tent like a lot of girls do graduated do

273
00:09:52,379 --> 00:09:55,828
a basement I've seen your pictures you

274
00:09:54,089 --> 00:09:58,110
crush it you grew some Kalonji cush that

275
00:09:55,828 --> 00:10:00,179
was gorgeous I'm proud of that you know

276
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:01,500
it's one of my favorites - I love that -

277
00:10:00,179 --> 00:10:03,239
my favorite strains put together it's

278
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,350
Tahoe G and grateful dogs you can't

279
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,060
really go wrong right there

280
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:08,278
try not to swerve I got both those from

281
00:10:06,059 --> 00:10:09,629
swerve ah where the hell was I going

282
00:10:08,278 --> 00:10:12,509
with this let's talk about some of the

283
00:10:09,629 --> 00:10:14,639
stuff that you learned that is different

284
00:10:12,509 --> 00:10:16,318
that you had to adjust major differences

285
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:18,720
you've noticed and learned going from

286
00:10:16,318 --> 00:10:20,490
like a small grow in your basement to

287
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,480
this big gigantic facility you said you

288
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:23,850
had a greenhouse do you know how many

289
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:25,199
square feet that greenhouse is I'm not

290
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:27,659
I've asked a couple people no one seems

291
00:10:25,198 --> 00:10:30,389
to know for sure what it is but we have

292
00:10:27,659 --> 00:10:33,328
we have two flower rooms and in each

293
00:10:30,389 --> 00:10:35,669
flower room there is 640 plants and 20

294
00:10:33,328 --> 00:10:37,349
gallons and or raised bed we've got

295
00:10:35,669 --> 00:10:39,078
raised beds and a couple raised beds if

296
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:41,310
you prefer the raised beds are there

297
00:10:39,078 --> 00:10:43,159
okay Spencer seems to be loving those

298
00:10:41,309 --> 00:10:44,338
two shadows in the Garden in Washington

299
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:47,669
okay

300
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:49,889
what's better about them it's just with

301
00:10:47,669 --> 00:10:51,539
the way we do them our raised beds are

302
00:10:49,889 --> 00:10:53,690
fed differently than we do our 20s our

303
00:10:51,539 --> 00:10:56,969
20s they get we actually get the

304
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:58,290
investees oh we use those and we brew

305
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:59,879
those but for the raised bed it's been

306
00:10:58,289 --> 00:11:01,409
no-till and it's been going note so we

307
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:03,600
haven't added any soil to it other than

308
00:11:01,409 --> 00:11:05,100
what goes in with the transplants it's

309
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,528
been like that since the opening of the

310
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,959
greenhouse I think two years ago

311
00:11:06,528 --> 00:11:10,938
Wow and it's full of life because we're

312
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:12,169
all organic it's full of life full of

313
00:11:10,938 --> 00:11:15,110
microbes and it's just it's just really

314
00:11:12,169 --> 00:11:16,458
cool the plants seem they get a little

315
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:17,899
bit bigger in the raised bed - they've

316
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:20,299
got more space for the roots to get out

317
00:11:17,899 --> 00:11:22,009
and the flowers just always seem to be a

318
00:11:20,299 --> 00:11:23,028
little bit better out of the raised bed

319
00:11:22,009 --> 00:11:25,039
wow that's what we're trying to

320
00:11:23,028 --> 00:11:25,759
transition into complete all raised beds

321
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:27,318
okay

322
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:28,999
keeping that life going in there yes

323
00:11:27,318 --> 00:11:31,159
we'll talk more about that when we get

324
00:11:28,999 --> 00:11:32,449
to the next part here so let's talk more

325
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:33,860
about some of the stuff that you had to

326
00:11:32,448 --> 00:11:36,198
change and that you've noticed going to

327
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:37,850
the big grow yeah it's pretty crazy like

328
00:11:36,198 --> 00:11:39,828
you know I the biggest I've ever had at

329
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:45,379
my house was at 4k in a basement and now

330
00:11:39,828 --> 00:11:47,388
we've got what is it we have 112

331
00:11:45,379 --> 00:11:48,709
kavita's in each room so we've had 224

332
00:11:47,389 --> 00:11:51,680
lights so I'm going from four lights at

333
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:53,299
220 for now and just getting used to the

334
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:54,708
size of the plants and how often I got a

335
00:11:53,299 --> 00:11:57,708
water room and how much I got a water

336
00:11:54,708 --> 00:12:00,049
and really changed it's just it was just

337
00:11:57,708 --> 00:12:02,239
basically it put into perspective how

338
00:12:00,049 --> 00:12:03,889
how little I actually was doing at my

339
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,360
house right but it made my growing at

340
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:07,879
home a lot easier to be honest oh yeah

341
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,889
yeah I feel the same I've got a hobby

342
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:11,420
groaning exactly it's like wow I used to

343
00:12:09,889 --> 00:12:13,308
think that watering these 20 plants was

344
00:12:11,419 --> 00:12:17,389
hard I was like oh I got a water by 20

345
00:12:13,308 --> 00:12:19,100
plants now but now I'm watering 320

346
00:12:17,389 --> 00:12:21,829
every day and I doing maintenance on a

347
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:23,659
fully aiding checking for bugs making

348
00:12:21,828 --> 00:12:25,489
sure there's no problems but in

349
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:26,629
supporting sticks everywhere you need to

350
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:28,430
stake city

351
00:12:26,629 --> 00:12:29,839
it's an Emmy d grow so you got to make

352
00:12:28,429 --> 00:12:31,458
sure that everything is tagged properly

353
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:34,430
yeah that was one thing that was really

354
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:36,018
crazy was going and getting because I'd

355
00:12:34,429 --> 00:12:37,789
never done anything other than a

356
00:12:36,019 --> 00:12:40,549
basement grow until I got here like I

357
00:12:37,789 --> 00:12:41,808
never worked in any dispensary I've

358
00:12:40,549 --> 00:12:43,490
never been in the industry ever I got my

359
00:12:41,808 --> 00:12:45,379
badge and started working there

360
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:48,289
and so that was one thing that was crazy

361
00:12:45,379 --> 00:12:50,240
was seeing like how heavily like it's

362
00:12:48,289 --> 00:12:51,980
like everything has to be tagged react

363
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,139
like if you get rid of it you have to

364
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:55,278
make sure that you like get rid of it in

365
00:12:54,139 --> 00:12:57,860
the computer and throw it in the right

366
00:12:55,278 --> 00:13:00,678
basket and incinerate the basket and

367
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:02,720
like that thing that was really that was

368
00:13:00,678 --> 00:13:04,789
crazy to be yeah it's still crazy it's

369
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,009
overkill but I like I like the overkill

370
00:13:04,789 --> 00:13:08,808
kind of music they do it keeps the I

371
00:13:07,009 --> 00:13:10,550
feel like it keeps everybody in check

372
00:13:08,808 --> 00:13:12,649
and it keeps the people that shouldn't

373
00:13:10,549 --> 00:13:14,359
be shouldn't be doing it it keeps them

374
00:13:12,649 --> 00:13:16,220
kind of a bay it creates a standard

375
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,750
exactly and if you can live up to that

376
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,730
standard then you shouldn't be growing

377
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:21,070
this product

378
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:22,480
is a medical product it is it's also a

379
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:24,010
recreational product for a lot of people

380
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,990
but I think that recreational use is

381
00:13:24,009 --> 00:13:28,629
also medical fortunately that makes

382
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:31,570
sense definitely yeah it's yeah it's my

383
00:13:28,629 --> 00:13:33,850
recreational yeah yeah it's my freedom

384
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:36,070
my fun yeah it's my vice it's my fun

385
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:37,778
like I don't getting too old to go to

386
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:41,970
too many concerts and go do ridiculous

387
00:13:37,778 --> 00:13:41,970
[ __ ] and just take some beds and my

388
00:13:42,809 --> 00:13:49,899
recreational outlet so man 320 giant

389
00:13:47,379 --> 00:13:51,850

390
00:13:49,899 --> 00:13:53,980
management all yourself the we kind of

391
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:55,810

398
00:14:07,899 --> 00:14:12,009

00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:15,698
you that sprayer we had at one time you

400
00:14:12,009 --> 00:14:17,470

401
00:14:15,698 --> 00:14:19,929

no chemicals are nothing on it's all

408
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:35,198
food all right what's a kind of

409
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:36,489
transition to that part because that's

410
00:14:35,198 --> 00:14:38,169
something that I've definitely noticed

411
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:40,720
since you started working at this place

412
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:43,179
your home grow has completely switched

413
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,769
to fully organic now right was that

414
00:14:43,179 --> 00:14:46,750
inspired by this place it was inspired

415
00:14:44,769 --> 00:14:47,919
by a few different things to be honest I

416
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,970
started working there and when I got in

417
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:50,139
the grow you know I was watering my

418
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:51,970
plants and so I needed something to

419
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:53,680
listen to and I started listening to old

420
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:54,639
podcast episodes of yours that I hadn't

421
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:55,149
listened to since I lived in North

422
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,350
Carolina

423
00:14:55,149 --> 00:14:57,549
except figured you know I've learned a

424
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:59,560
couple of new things let me see if I can

425
00:14:57,549 --> 00:15:01,659
take anything new from these and I was

426
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:03,278
listening to the episodes of when Sean

427
00:15:01,659 --> 00:15:05,110
Sean shut up - King :

428
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:06,698
and yeah he really he was so passionate

429
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:08,709
about it and like that was kind of cool

430
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:10,389
to me it seems pretty cool I'm learning

431
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:12,099
about what I'm doing here yeah work and

432
00:15:10,389 --> 00:15:15,669
then I also start hanging out frosty

433
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:17,019
okay frosty frosty frosty frosty and

434
00:15:15,669 --> 00:15:19,059
he's the same but he's super passionate

435
00:15:17,019 --> 00:15:20,289
about it and he was all like you know he

436
00:15:19,059 --> 00:15:22,479
was throwing dropping knowledge on me

437
00:15:20,289 --> 00:15:24,519
every day and one day I just was like

438
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,690
you know what like I was gonna do ahead

439
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:28,448
my outdoor going I was like I'm gonna do

440
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:29,380
a raised bed no-till organic outdoor for

441
00:15:28,448 --> 00:15:31,509
the summer and see how much I like

442
00:15:29,379 --> 00:15:32,528
organic and I might switch to it then I

443
00:15:31,509 --> 00:15:34,389
was like you know

444
00:15:32,528 --> 00:15:35,828
just completely go organic is so much I

445
00:15:34,389 --> 00:15:37,659
feel like it's so much I know it's

446
00:15:35,828 --> 00:15:39,669
better like I just you know I know like

447
00:15:37,659 --> 00:15:41,649
it's it's just I don't know so I made

448
00:15:39,669 --> 00:15:43,990
the switch completely and now that I've

449
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:45,818
been doing it I've had one fool complete

450
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:47,470
like from because I switch kind of

451
00:15:45,818 --> 00:15:48,639
halfway through a cycle okay you know

452
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:48,939
what I'm not gonna use these bottles

453
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:52,329
anymore

454
00:15:48,938 --> 00:15:53,558
Organic now nice and so I had plants and

455
00:15:52,328 --> 00:15:55,568
veg and then plants halfway through

456
00:15:53,558 --> 00:15:56,980
flower went through that cycle of plants

457
00:15:55,568 --> 00:15:58,838
and bench and I went through but I just

458
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:02,259
now just like last week to go down my

459
00:15:58,839 --> 00:16:04,720
first from seed to harvest like 100

460
00:16:02,259 --> 00:16:07,990
fully organic sweet and it's by far the

461
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:09,879
best that's great to hear

462
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:12,159
nice Congrats thank you so you're gonna

463
00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:14,139
continue that path for sure are you

464
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:15,969
going to eventually turn your home grow

465
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:17,860
into no-till yeah that's what I want to

466
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:19,389
do I mean if I'm doing no-till soil

467
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:21,220
right now like I'm reusing the soil that

468
00:16:19,389 --> 00:16:22,480
I have is I'm using seven gallon pots

469
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:24,339
and just taking the root ball out and

470
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,740
put the two gals in do you want to teach

471
00:16:24,339 --> 00:16:27,999
my listeners just briefly a quick lesson

472
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:29,769
on no tilt because I don't think we've

473
00:16:27,999 --> 00:16:31,629
covered too much no-till on the podcast

474
00:16:29,769 --> 00:16:33,370
save as much as I know I'm by no means

475
00:16:31,629 --> 00:16:35,589
an expert on and I'm new to this thing

476
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:37,870
as well but it's a basically no-till

477
00:16:35,589 --> 00:16:39,309
soil is when you have a soil that you've

478
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:42,938
amended yourself and you've planted the

479
00:16:39,308 --> 00:16:45,129
plant in it and you just defeated top

480
00:16:42,938 --> 00:16:46,120
dressings and whatever teas you want to

481
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:47,230
do whatever you got to do you've got

482
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,778
worms in there you've got a lot of

483
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:51,459
microbe life going in there and it's

484
00:16:49,778 --> 00:16:53,049
after three years I believe that you've

485
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:55,328
been running the soil you never you

486
00:16:53,049 --> 00:16:56,828
never actually like take the soil up or

487
00:16:55,328 --> 00:16:58,448
put new soil you reuse the soil every

488
00:16:56,828 --> 00:17:00,578
time just taking the root ball out and

489
00:16:58,448 --> 00:17:03,519
putting a new plant in we're using the

490
00:17:00,578 --> 00:17:05,798
old dirt trying to just in no-till you

491
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:08,259
want to irritate the land as little as

492
00:17:05,798 --> 00:17:09,699
possible okay and after three years it's

493
00:17:08,259 --> 00:17:11,859
basically self-sustaining all you need

494
00:17:09,699 --> 00:17:13,600
to need to do is that water Wow

495
00:17:11,859 --> 00:17:14,859
yeah but with the no-till is just you've

496
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,808
got a lot of microbe life living in

497
00:17:14,859 --> 00:17:18,158
there you've got a lot of microorganisms

498
00:17:16,808 --> 00:17:20,199
breaking everything down your plants are

499
00:17:18,159 --> 00:17:22,230
really really really gonna thrive in a

500
00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:24,640
in a well well-maintained no-till

501
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:25,899
environment because um you know you're

502
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,339
not really feeding your plants at that

503
00:17:25,898 --> 00:17:29,019
point you're feeding these

504
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:31,029
microorganisms that live in your soil

505
00:17:29,019 --> 00:17:32,769
and then they're gonna absorb all these

506
00:17:31,029 --> 00:17:34,509
things that you're feeding them release

507
00:17:32,769 --> 00:17:37,058
them back into the soil and that's what

508
00:17:34,509 --> 00:17:38,140
your plans are gonna uptake and it's you

509
00:17:37,058 --> 00:17:39,450
know it's a cycle of life that's how

510
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:41,770
things are meant to be and you're just

511
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:43,419
carefully maintaining it there and it

512
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:45,269
allows the plant to eat what it wants is

513
00:17:43,419 --> 00:17:46,860
exactly the ratios you want

514
00:17:45,269 --> 00:17:48,089
force-feeding at some bottle you're not

515
00:17:46,859 --> 00:17:49,769
holding it down putting a nipple on a

516
00:17:48,089 --> 00:17:52,019
bottle trying to show some formula in

517
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:55,170
its mouth it's beautiful yeah okay and

518
00:17:52,019 --> 00:17:57,210
so how long does it take to can I almost

519
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:58,529
take if I grow a crop now that's not

520
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:00,120
know till they'll because it's not

521
00:17:58,529 --> 00:18:01,529
amended so I can't do it never mind I

522
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:03,119
think I know the answer I was gonna ask

523
00:18:01,529 --> 00:18:05,460
if I could take a plant that I'm gonna

524
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:07,949
harvest tomorrow chop the plant pull the

525
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:09,808
root ball out can I now start my no-till

526
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:12,179
process with that soil or do I need to

527
00:18:09,808 --> 00:18:13,799
pre prep my pot at the beginning you

528
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:16,110
probably could you know I'm saying but

529
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:18,029
it would probably be best to start it in

530
00:18:16,109 --> 00:18:19,469
an amended soil okay because you so that

531
00:18:18,029 --> 00:18:21,420
way you know you've already got your

532
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:22,740
soil is already inoculated you've got

533
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:24,210
life all the way from the top to the

534
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:25,500
bottom because if you're just throwing a

535
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:27,720
new plan in there at that point you're

536
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:29,039
kind of just it's gonna be it's gonna

537
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,299
take a couple weeks for it to take off

538
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:33,329
really because it's not gonna have any

539
00:18:30,299 --> 00:18:34,889
the there's no there's no life in there

540
00:18:33,329 --> 00:18:38,129
to give it right food it's gonna fire on

541
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:41,730
exacts gotta get going and it's not

542
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:45,210
gonna take off okay but yeah sounds like

543
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:47,370
a great sounds like a great method to

544
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:48,360
Lindsay the traveling stoner she just

545
00:18:47,369 --> 00:18:49,799

she wants I know what she wants to talk

551
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:02,070
about she got a new carbon cap in that

552
00:18:59,789 --> 00:19:06,029
I'm excited about it's uh I think it's

553
00:19:02,069 --> 00:19:08,099
called the [ __ ] cap China it looks like

554
00:19:06,029 --> 00:19:10,920
looks like on the rig she wants take

555
00:19:08,099 --> 00:19:13,169
dad's and use all right so where are we

556
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:14,670
on my notes we got distracted here men

557
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:16,140
no-till that sounds great I kind of want

558
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:18,120
to get into that it's something that's

559
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:20,850
sustainable yeah it's fun it's cool you

560
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:21,750
learn a lot yeah it's it's fun I don't

561
00:19:20,849 --> 00:19:23,699
know it's really hard to explain you

562
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:25,170
just get it better you feel more like it

563
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:26,850
sounds cheesy but you feel more in sync

564
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:27,960
with your plans when you're like right

565
00:19:26,849 --> 00:19:30,689
when you're controlling their

566
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:32,308
environment I do sort of uh when Sean

567
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:33,900
was here often and we all got it when I

568
00:19:32,308 --> 00:19:35,730
was being sponsored by the Rocky Mount

569
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:37,140
were many big shout out to Jay from the

570
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:38,610
Rocky Mountain worm company they were

571
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:40,140
sponsoring me and they were actually

572
00:19:38,609 --> 00:19:42,209
giving me all of the amendments that I

573
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:45,300
needed to do everything organically I

574
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:47,069
really loved my product and I loved if I

575
00:19:45,299 --> 00:19:48,569
felt like a farmer you know it exactly

576
00:19:47,069 --> 00:19:51,569
had warm [ __ ] underneath my fingernails

577
00:19:48,569 --> 00:19:53,519
and I've smelled like fish fish emulsion

578
00:19:51,569 --> 00:19:55,049
and I was just bunky you know what I

579
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:56,028
mean at a DB Realty brewing at my house

580
00:19:55,049 --> 00:19:58,038
right now

581
00:19:56,028 --> 00:20:00,460
in the door and it's gonna just smell

582
00:19:58,038 --> 00:20:02,298
smell that meat are that kelp meal

583
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:03,710
walking in and you've got the five

584
00:20:02,298 --> 00:20:09,168
gallon bucket of tea brewing and there's

585
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:11,749
foam three yeah but I also I ran it

586
00:20:09,169 --> 00:20:14,599
drain and healthy we did nutrients they

587
00:20:11,749 --> 00:20:16,098
came out of big 5-gallon jugs into I put

588
00:20:14,598 --> 00:20:17,960
them into basically a beaker and then

589
00:20:16,098 --> 00:20:20,118
put those into a reservoir and mixed it

590
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:22,519
that just in the pH and I did it with

591
00:20:20,118 --> 00:20:24,648
like goggles on and gloves and it felt

592
00:20:22,519 --> 00:20:27,440
very scientifically I liked that is well

593
00:20:24,648 --> 00:20:30,709
some fun I mean and now at home I'm

594
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:32,899
running on I like botanic air bottles

595
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:34,940
it's simple for what I do I breed and so

596
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:36,378
I don't need to do a lot of crazy [ __ ]

597
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:39,528
for what I'm breeding with and the

598
00:20:36,378 --> 00:20:41,298
botanic air is perfect its I like mixing

599
00:20:39,528 --> 00:20:42,769
the bottles a little bit I put some warm

600
00:20:41,298 --> 00:20:44,388
castings in there there's an organic

601
00:20:42,769 --> 00:20:45,769
commitments in the soil but when it

602
00:20:44,388 --> 00:20:47,569
comes time to feed a little bit I grab

603
00:20:45,769 --> 00:20:50,028
the bottles of Botanica it seems to be

604
00:20:47,569 --> 00:20:51,950
the easiest way for me but I so much I

605
00:20:50,028 --> 00:20:53,898
did a bunch of veg bloom I've got

606
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:55,909
vegetable that'll probably go in the

607
00:20:53,898 --> 00:20:57,138
next cycle I've actually noticed I

608
00:20:55,909 --> 00:20:58,729
wanted to save this for a whole episode

609
00:20:57,138 --> 00:21:01,248
I've noticed that we'll do an episode

610
00:20:58,729 --> 00:21:03,710
about this certain strains actually

611
00:21:01,249 --> 00:21:06,288
prefer certain nutrients I've noticed

612
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:08,179
that if I cuz I've ran I've been doing

613
00:21:06,288 --> 00:21:09,979
this for a long time I've ran so many

614
00:21:08,179 --> 00:21:11,719
nutrient lines and I've had flow for ten

615
00:21:09,979 --> 00:21:13,669
years and I've noticed that if I run

616
00:21:11,719 --> 00:21:15,288
flow with this brand it acts this way if

617
00:21:13,669 --> 00:21:17,119
I run flow with this branded acts this

618
00:21:15,288 --> 00:21:19,098
way different brands cuz I've had the

619
00:21:17,118 --> 00:21:21,138
same grow room set up for so long and

620
00:21:19,098 --> 00:21:22,968
yeah they'll change from different

621
00:21:21,138 --> 00:21:24,588
nutrients psycho made everything real

622
00:21:22,969 --> 00:21:26,808
colorful and fluffy but I hated the

623
00:21:24,588 --> 00:21:28,428
flavor so and advance nutrients made

624
00:21:26,808 --> 00:21:30,618
everything taste exactly the same but I

625
00:21:28,429 --> 00:21:33,019
got huge buds but everything tasted

626
00:21:30,618 --> 00:21:34,128
exactly the same that was I think the

627
00:21:33,019 --> 00:21:36,108
advanced might have been one of the

628
00:21:34,128 --> 00:21:39,848
first brands I tried to use nice yeah

629
00:21:36,108 --> 00:21:42,079
start with Mills Mills pays the bills

630
00:21:39,848 --> 00:21:44,148
it was tight I like I mean when I was

631
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:46,848
that it was cool you know I like the

632
00:21:44,148 --> 00:21:49,398
results that I was getting but I don't

633
00:21:46,848 --> 00:21:51,200
know the organic is just it's like I

634
00:21:49,398 --> 00:21:57,678
said it's more fun to me yeah yeah just

635
00:21:51,200 --> 00:22:01,308
I feel like I'm doing more I don't know

636
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:02,899
till look I've grabbed this dabber this

637
00:22:01,308 --> 00:22:04,819
is actually it looks like a it looks

638
00:22:02,898 --> 00:22:06,498
like a green colored pencil and it's

639
00:22:04,819 --> 00:22:08,088
actually a glass dabber I just grabbed

640
00:22:06,499 --> 00:22:09,559
this to try to make a note so I'm gonna

641
00:22:08,088 --> 00:22:12,710
reach this way and not look like

642
00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:13,730
dumbass and grab a pen that's there we

643
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:18,019
go and I'll make it no we're gonna do a

644
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:21,079
no-till episode in the future okay does

645
00:22:18,019 --> 00:22:22,789
frosty live in Pueblo or Springs he was

00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:59,839
three by three or four by four like at

662
00:22:55,970 --> 00:23:05,059
work yeah three feet tall but then it

663
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:06,769
goes like we have 40 plants in it okay

664
00:23:05,059 --> 00:23:08,149
so there's a really really really really

665
00:23:06,769 --> 00:23:09,740
long I'm just gonna ask how many worms

666
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:11,420
are in there like how many did you put

667
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:17,450
in there Oh they've been in there for we

668
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:19,310
haven't had any yeah yeah and there's so

669
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:21,890

674
00:23:28,609 --> 00:23:31,909
this year for some reason gonna bring

675
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:33,740
you guys some genetics or how we can't

676
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:36,320
do that anymore it's not though yeah

677
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:38,000
more of that so we're gonna say that you

678
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:40,369
got a label everything everything's

679
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,809
gotta be tagged by the meb so I can't

680
00:23:40,369 --> 00:23:43,099
just grab a clone and drive over there

681
00:23:41,809 --> 00:23:45,109
and be like here's a clone you guys now

682
00:23:43,099 --> 00:23:47,869
you have Capleton good luck tight yeah

683
00:23:45,109 --> 00:23:50,539
I'd bring you some 31% test in genetics

684
00:23:47,869 --> 00:23:53,689
yeah it'd be fun over there oh yeah all

685
00:23:50,539 --> 00:23:56,000
right so what's next what's the next

686
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:58,850
evolution if you go all full no-till

687
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,829
then what's the next the next way to

688
00:23:58,849 --> 00:24:02,240
improve your garden after that I mean

689
00:24:00,829 --> 00:24:03,529
once your Noto you know you do your

690
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,240
thing you figure out some good top dress

691
00:24:03,529 --> 00:24:06,410
recipes really just you cuz I don't mean

692
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:08,240
by that point if you got a fool on

693
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:09,590
no-till like I mean mountain organics

694
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,660
and everybody on Instagram really wants

695
00:24:09,589 --> 00:24:13,369
to see like some really I mean this

696
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:14,630
guy's where I discovered no-till from a

697
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:16,159
couple years back before I even knew

698
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:19,220
when Ocho was I was following this guy

699
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:21,860
Mountain organics he's he's got the tech

700
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:23,059
down with the note oh but yeah once

701
00:24:21,859 --> 00:24:23,459
you've got it going for like that many

702
00:24:23,059 --> 00:24:24,960
cycle

703
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:27,298
you know you you know what it you know

704
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,679
what you need and I really don't think

705
00:24:27,298 --> 00:24:30,269
there's much more you can do other than

706
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:32,250
just kind of like seeing if anything new

707
00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:34,679
comes out you know if I do a new style

708
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:37,230
or something's out just new here the

709
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:38,730
plants yeah exactly yeah or if you know

710
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:40,259
hunting you said that you use easy

711
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:43,110
cloners at the big Grove and we were

712
00:24:40,259 --> 00:24:46,200
talking before the show how do you do

713
00:24:43,109 --> 00:24:55,048
those organically just curious its om

714
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:57,500
our eyes or max okay Mauro okay yeah do

715
00:24:55,048 --> 00:25:00,829
someone we just started using this uh

716
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:03,599
inoculum from mountain organics actually

717
00:25:00,829 --> 00:25:05,369
that is supposed to be the truth

718
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:08,490
so we'll see we actually just art using

719
00:25:05,369 --> 00:25:11,548
that last week nice and so uh yeah I was

720
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:13,500
told that inside of the clone X dipping

721
00:25:11,548 --> 00:25:15,750
gel that I use for my cloner that there

722
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:18,148
is a excuse me for the throat clearing

723
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:21,119
but there is a chemical called

724
00:25:18,148 --> 00:25:22,199
purple lavender dye I think is what it

725
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:24,418
is lavender

726
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,620
I think it's purple lavender dye and a

727
00:25:24,419 --> 00:25:27,120
friend of mine was like oh dude don't

728
00:25:25,619 --> 00:25:29,879
use that chicks he saw it on my shelf

729
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:31,229
and he's actually I don't know his

730
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:33,270
degree but he's got college degrees and

731
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:37,200
when he saw he's like no he's gonna

732
00:25:33,269 --> 00:25:39,119
freaked out on me yeah he told me to get

733
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,519
rid of that [ __ ] so you guys do some

734
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:43,229
research that purple velvet die or

735
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:44,730
purple crystalline velvet die or

736
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:46,950
something like that I don't recall

737
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:48,269
exactly but if you google clone ax find

738
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:49,230
the ingredients that purple dye and

739
00:25:48,269 --> 00:25:52,038
they're supposed to be really bad for

740
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:54,360
you also there's something in there that

741
00:25:52,038 --> 00:25:55,769
it's really not good for you if you get

742
00:25:54,359 --> 00:25:57,778
it on your hands and stuff it could

743
00:25:55,769 --> 00:25:59,278
definitely cause you some problems so go

744
00:25:57,778 --> 00:26:00,359
do some research on clone X that's why I

745
00:25:59,278 --> 00:26:02,250
was asking will how they do it

746
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:03,839
organically yeah we do most of our we

747
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:04,980
only use the clone boxes those are like

748
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:06,750
we're trying to phase out of those so we

749
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:09,929
just have two of those right now most of

750
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:12,119
our clones go into little root rights

751
00:26:09,929 --> 00:26:14,460
that we have packed into little like

752
00:26:12,119 --> 00:26:16,558
one-by-one cubes with some pro mix and

753
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:19,259
then just a little like a solution of ro

754
00:26:16,558 --> 00:26:23,668
hallo and then some-some humic acids

755
00:26:19,259 --> 00:26:25,169
okay from bio AG and then we dip those

756
00:26:23,669 --> 00:26:27,419
in the hallow and just let those sit in

757
00:26:25,169 --> 00:26:29,070
the domes for two weeks they seem to

758
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:31,860
love hallo everybody's on the hello kick

759
00:26:29,069 --> 00:26:34,079
now nice liquid aloe or powder we get

760
00:26:31,859 --> 00:26:35,709
just straight raw cold pressed aloe okay

761
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:38,379
Dipti cutting in that

762
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:39,490
right into the root riot and with the if

763
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:42,070
you're putting it in your water I mean

764
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:43,538
you need this just a small finite amount

765
00:26:42,069 --> 00:26:45,158
of out low goes a long long way okay

766
00:26:43,538 --> 00:26:46,690
like for a whole 300 gallons when we're

767
00:26:45,159 --> 00:26:48,850
watering our plants we use one ounce oh

768
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:50,409
[ __ ] okay so just one ounce that's like

769
00:26:48,849 --> 00:26:52,028
a coffee cup basically that's a shot

770
00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:58,179
that's a shot oh yeah shot glass thirty

771
00:26:52,028 --> 00:27:00,609
milliliters just over judge yeah I went

772
00:26:58,179 --> 00:27:01,840
way bigger yeah okay Wow nice a lot of

773

get some powder to Hal oh that's not

775
00:27:03,308 --> 00:27:07,148
something if you've got a recommendation

776

777
00:27:07,148 --> 00:27:10,569
gonna say I'm glad you said it before I

778
00:27:09,069 --> 00:27:12,308
did they do not pay the podcast they're

779
00:27:10,569 --> 00:27:14,950
not a sponsor that's the place to go for

780
00:27:12,308 --> 00:27:17,918
that type of [ __ ] just coconut water

781
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:18,669
powdered aloe just go check out build a

782
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:20,288
soil calm

783
00:27:18,669 --> 00:27:22,270
I recommend that everything you like

784
00:27:20,288 --> 00:27:24,609
don't know anything about organics and

785
00:27:22,269 --> 00:27:25,898
like don't know where to go and need its

786

but he's got everything you need on

787
00:27:25,898 --> 00:27:28,839
there to start doing organically from

788
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:32,349
like buying the supplies and then he

789
00:27:28,839 --> 00:27:35,230
also has like directions on how to clone

790
00:27:32,349 --> 00:27:36,428
veg flour different top test regimens

791
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:38,380
he's got everything you need to know on

792
00:27:36,429 --> 00:27:39,250

793
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:41,169
great I haven't checked out their

794
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:42,009
website in a little while but yeah I

795
00:27:41,169 --> 00:27:43,360
need to go check that out

796
00:27:42,009 --> 00:27:45,490
sounds like they've updated a whole

797
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:47,168
bunch with them but yeah they've got all

798
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:51,009
your powder dry organic amendments and

799
00:27:47,169 --> 00:27:52,630
they'll ship them to you everywhere the

800
00:27:51,009 --> 00:27:54,129
great price is very affordable they're

801
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:55,179
reasonable the more you buy the cheaper

802
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:56,860
it gets because they're powdered in

803
00:27:55,179 --> 00:27:58,690
their bulk they don't waste a lot of

804
00:27:56,859 --> 00:28:00,129
money on a lot of packaging so they're

805
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:01,419
actually gonna make a little package up

806
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:02,528
for you they're gonna weigh it there in

807
00:28:01,419 --> 00:28:04,538
their warehouse they're gonna ship out

808
00:28:02,528 --> 00:28:07,000
exactly what you order yeah great

809
00:28:04,538 --> 00:28:08,288
customer service one time there was a

810
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,298
weird something we were in my order I

811
00:28:08,288 --> 00:28:11,679
ordered like two things on the same day

812
00:28:10,298 --> 00:28:13,509
and wanted to be in the same order and I

813
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:14,919
emailed him and like he personally

814
00:28:13,509 --> 00:28:16,658
called me from like his cell phone and

815
00:28:14,919 --> 00:28:18,278
he got I worked out with me and got it

816
00:28:16,659 --> 00:28:20,289
all shipped out no after charge nothing

817
00:28:18,278 --> 00:28:22,569
that's really cool yeah I love companies

818
00:28:20,288 --> 00:28:23,829
that do that kind of stuff in the grow

819
00:28:22,569 --> 00:28:25,778
industry there are a lot of companies

820
00:28:23,829 --> 00:28:27,129
that if they make a mistake they go home

821
00:28:25,778 --> 00:28:28,990
we've got your money have a nice day

822
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:31,179
he'll either see you again or we won't

823
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:34,210
we get plenty of business from plenty of

824
00:28:31,179 --> 00:28:35,440
other exactly yeah I wrote down a whole

825
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:36,429
bunch of notes but you wrote down a

826
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,409
bunch of notes too I want to make sure

827
00:28:36,429 --> 00:28:43,080
that we cover anything that you wanted

828
00:28:38,409 --> 00:28:43,080
to talk about oh let's see here

829
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:48,419
frosty shattered out frosty yeah frosty

830
00:28:47,429 --> 00:28:49,559
is a good dude I don't see that dude

831
00:28:48,419 --> 00:28:50,640
often enough we have to make sure to

832
00:28:49,558 --> 00:28:51,950
give that dude a huge shoutout we're

833
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,910
gonna get him on the show for know til

834
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:57,558
frosty don't be nervous just come on the

835
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:59,970
show bro the show I think I missed here

836
00:28:57,558 --> 00:29:02,190
is the vortex brewers and irrigation

837
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:03,089
systems that I learned at work that

838
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:06,048
sounds pretty cool if you're into

839
00:29:03,089 --> 00:29:09,058
brewing teas compost season everything

840
00:29:06,048 --> 00:29:10,679
you know the more agitation they get the

841
00:29:09,058 --> 00:29:11,789
better they sound like they brew faster

842
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:13,019
and a little it's gonna be a little

843
00:29:11,789 --> 00:29:14,899
stronger the microbes are gonna be a

844
00:29:13,019 --> 00:29:17,789
little more active and that they brew

845
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:21,000
more irrigated I'm just using air stones

846
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:22,529
works but the vortex is Brewer it's kind

847
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,880
of self-explanatory there's like you

848
00:29:22,529 --> 00:29:25,889
know it's a vortex that spins inside

849
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:27,900
there's three tubes and it spins the

850
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:30,000
water really felt like a vortex super

851
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:31,259
fast super fast yeah and it'll get I

852
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,490
mean you'll get a tea brewing where

853
00:29:31,259 --> 00:29:34,379
you'll have bubbles popping up within

854
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:35,819
minutes and it's not like there's no

855
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:37,590
extra yuca and there anything like that

856
00:29:35,819 --> 00:29:39,960
it's just wow it's just it gets

857
00:29:37,589 --> 00:29:42,359
activated so quickly I've actually seen

858
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:44,160
guys clean out their vortex Brewer and

859
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:45,899
put bubble bags in there and make ash in

860
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:48,480
it oh that's funny because it's been so

861
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:50,820
rapidly they totally make ash within the

862
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,769
off season that's funny harvest and

863
00:29:50,819 --> 00:29:54,659
clean it out makes mash then clean it

864
00:29:52,769 --> 00:29:56,308
out again and then put tea in it that's

865
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:59,429
all and the irrigation system what else

866
00:29:56,308 --> 00:30:01,259
we gonna talk about these are cool

867
00:29:59,429 --> 00:30:03,509
I could never be on a run one in my

868
00:30:01,259 --> 00:30:07,079
house because I mean I'm 4k I have like

869
00:30:03,509 --> 00:30:10,019
at most 40 plants inside but uh it's

870
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:10,889
really cool it's you know I'm sure most

871
00:30:10,019 --> 00:30:12,029
people know about them with their

872
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:14,160
growers but for those of you that don't

873
00:30:12,029 --> 00:30:16,710
it's a irrigation system is basically a

874
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:18,630
self watering system that you put bit a

875
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:20,910
little emitter in each pot or down the

876
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:23,640
line of the raised bed and you turn on a

877
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:25,200
motor and it just sucks all the water on

878
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:27,059
the tank and gives each plant the exact

879
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,470
same amount of water it cuts the

880
00:30:27,058 --> 00:30:31,319
watering time from like an hour and a

881
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:33,179
half to about 20 minutes right the time

882
00:30:31,319 --> 00:30:35,250
it takes you to build that system saves

883
00:30:33,179 --> 00:30:36,450
you so my gosh yeah I've been telling

884
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:38,700
all of the listeners that we're gonna

885
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:41,279
talk about building a watering system so

886
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:43,410
you just teased it again half way

887
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:45,119
written like I've got about half way

888
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:46,019
written it's kind of very specific it's

889
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:48,329
for your needs

890
00:30:46,019 --> 00:30:49,740
yeah guideline written so we'll put that

891
00:30:48,329 --> 00:30:51,480
out pretty soon here I can record that

892
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:53,308
one like it'll take me less than an hour

893
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:54,569
so just sit down and do that one night

894
00:30:53,308 --> 00:30:56,069
so guys that one's coming how to build

895
00:30:54,569 --> 00:30:58,710
your own irrigation system

896
00:30:56,069 --> 00:31:01,019
sweet I think that if you've got eight

897
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:02,610
plants or a hundred and eight plants or

898
00:31:01,019 --> 00:31:05,099
800 plants I think an irrigation system

899
00:31:02,609 --> 00:31:07,559
could be very useful for you it

900
00:31:05,099 --> 00:31:09,000
sometimes when I'm away I'm like uh I

901
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:10,349
want to just go home and check on the

902
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,430
plans and see if they're dry when I go

903
00:31:10,349 --> 00:31:13,439
home and check on the plants and see if

904
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:15,690
they're dry or I when I had the larger

905
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:17,759
grow I just want to I would go to Denver

906
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:20,430
for shows and on the way back I would

907
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:22,379
stop and grow and check on the plant LCD

908
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:24,509
I was yeah kisum she can go wrong

909
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:26,190
sometimes it will clog eventually your

910
00:31:24,509 --> 00:31:27,480
your watering system is going to clogged

911
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:28,590
up you're gonna have to mess with it but

912
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:30,059
we'll talk about building one of those

913
00:31:28,589 --> 00:31:31,709
it's very useful no matter how many

914
00:31:30,059 --> 00:31:36,299
plants you're running it can definitely

915
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:37,350
save you a bunch of time like if you

916
00:31:36,299 --> 00:31:39,569
want to blow out of room

917
00:31:37,349 --> 00:31:42,869
dude I'm six foot five and in a

918
00:31:39,569 --> 00:31:45,750
residential growth probably they're

919
00:31:42,869 --> 00:31:47,339
they're about six foot down yeah walking

920
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:48,809
through stuff sometimes I'd leave people

921
00:31:47,339 --> 00:31:50,879
like what's with the walkway you're not

922
00:31:48,809 --> 00:31:53,339
growing cement and I'm like be as big as

923
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:55,740
me come on and then I put my dreads in a

924
00:31:53,339 --> 00:31:58,559
giant bun and now I'm like seven feet

925
00:31:55,740 --> 00:32:00,450
tall at that point yeah it's it's I'm

926
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:02,339
fun to grow room it's awesome I can't

927
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:05,519
wear too baggy of clothes because I get

928
00:32:02,339 --> 00:32:07,399
hung up on everything yeah I wish I

929
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:11,549
could shrink up a little bit sometimes

930
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:14,400
to be this gigantic look like yeah

931

947
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:49,370
mine just bought some property down

948
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:53,099
south a couple about five acres land in

949
00:32:49,369 --> 00:32:54,119
Costilla County filling out some permits

950
00:32:53,099 --> 00:32:55,500
and stuff right now we'll see we'll see

951
00:32:54,119 --> 00:32:56,639
where it takes us we're just getting

952
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:58,259
some stuff done out there and little

953
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,610
barefoot farms yeah we're hoping to get

954
00:32:58,259 --> 00:33:01,019
a little barefoot barefoot ranch

955
00:32:59,609 --> 00:33:02,069
barefoot farms with a couple hoop houses

956
00:33:01,019 --> 00:33:03,930
there's something going on out there

957
00:33:02,069 --> 00:33:06,539
it'd be pretty awesome yeah yeah it's

958
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:08,100
pretty prime pretty prime a little a

959
00:33:06,539 --> 00:33:09,690
little plot of land and do it on so

960
00:33:08,099 --> 00:33:17,039
pretty soon you'll be open them up

961
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:17,370
some coffee shops between us some funny

962
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:19,440
[ __ ]

963
00:33:17,369 --> 00:33:20,849
get some coffee shops bro that's always

964
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,980
a good investment that's my advice

965
00:33:20,849 --> 00:33:24,509
invest in coffee shops that's just

966
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:27,120
random stuff no don't invest in coffee

967
00:33:24,509 --> 00:33:28,619
