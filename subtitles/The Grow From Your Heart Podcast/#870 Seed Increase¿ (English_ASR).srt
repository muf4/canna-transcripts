let's jump right into it I do have a

33
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:34,280
bunch of great content planned out for

34
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,719
you I got a great comment on YouTube

35
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:38,118
that I wanted to address here on the

36
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:39,959
podcast this one came from YouTube like

37
00:01:38,118 --> 00:01:41,920
I said it came from somebody called ZZ

38
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:43,319
trop and they said something that's been

39
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,759
getting my attention a phrase that's

40
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:47,000
been popping up something that I just

41
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:48,718
wanted to address uh this could almost

42
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,519
be a pet peeve if you will I'm sure if

43
00:01:48,718 --> 00:01:52,199
you've been watching you remember for a

44
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:54,158
little while I was doing growroom pet

45
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,719
peeves uh things that just drive me

46
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,880
crazy uh the phrase in this message just

47
00:01:56,718 --> 00:02:01,118
for some reason it bugs me let's jump

48
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:04,399
right into it it says hey rosta Jeff how

49
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:06,718
does a seed increase work multiple

50
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:09,598
multiple male pollination or a selected

51
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:11,759
male so the question is how does a seed

52
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:13,839
increase work and uh I don't even know

53
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:15,280
man what the [ __ ] is a seed increase a

54
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,640
seed increase is a new word that I've

55
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,800
recently heard popping up in the

56
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:21,279
Cannabis industry uh people are like I'm

57
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,800
going to do a seed increase um you're

58
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,159
going to make more seeds is what that

59
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,080
means yes I get it but the problem with

60
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:29,239
that is it's not an increase every time

61
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:31,440
you put that male plant to that female

62
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:34,200
plant you work creating a filial an F1

63
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:36,479
filial generation of something and or at

64
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:38,079
the same time progressing a filial

65
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:40,000
generation or you're doing something a

66
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,560
backat cross it's not just a seed

67
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,199
increase unless you're doing s1's

68
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,158
possibly you may consider that a seed

69
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:47,759
increase that's the only possible way

70
00:02:46,158 --> 00:02:49,840
that the term seed increase would work

71
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:51,079
in my brain but I see this term being

72
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,840
applied and maybe it's a real

73
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,840
Horticultural term I did not Google it

74
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,400
I'm just saying uh that drives me crazy

75
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,840
what the [ __ ] is a seed increase you're

76
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,039
either making more fem seeds or making

77
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,640
reg seeds and at that Point use the

78
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:04,400
correct terminology are you making

79
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:07,318
because you're making another generation

80
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:10,239
and label it properly if you took a pack

81
00:03:07,318 --> 00:03:12,119
of we'll say Jack Tripper seeds you

82
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,319
could get a boy you could get a girl you

83
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:16,239
could pollinate you've made more seeds

84
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:19,639
but you did not make more Jack Tripper

85
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:21,319
f1s you've now made f2s so label that

86
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:23,238
properly it's not a seed increase it's a

87
00:03:21,318 --> 00:03:25,798
forward in some sort of filial

88
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:28,799
generation so uh how does a seed

89
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:30,560
increase work I don't know man um that's

90
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,560
just something that recently popped up

91
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,878
in the [ __ ] cannabis ganja growing

92
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,959
breeding seeding world I don't like the

93
00:03:34,878 --> 00:03:38,399
phrase seed increase because that just

94
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,039
makes it sound like I'm going to create

95
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,400
more seeds but to do that like I've

96
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:44,318
stated there's got to be a forward

97
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,840
filial generation unless you're only

98
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:48,919
making s1's which then just say I'm

99
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:51,479
going to make s1's I'm going to self it

100
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:53,039
I'm going to make fem which makes a lot

101
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:55,078
more sense I've got more notes I wrote

102
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:56,318
down on this paper it's a new term what

103
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:58,640
the [ __ ] does that mean that's what I

104
00:03:56,318 --> 00:04:00,839
wrote uh every pollination is a

105
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:04,598
generation so just label it as such it's

106
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:07,759
either an F1 an S1 an R1 uh maybe it's

107
00:04:04,598 --> 00:04:09,479
an F7 very unlikely but it could be but

108
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:11,518
that makes more sense to me than the

109
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:13,560
phrase seed incase I don't know what

110
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,000
that means I I understand what it means

111
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,839
you're going to make more seeds to make

112
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,478
the seeds available but it's deeper than

113
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:21,478
that bro label it properly have some

114
00:04:19,478 --> 00:04:23,680
more uh some more care for your project

115
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:25,079
label it tell us what it is uh I get it

116
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,319
you're making more seeds but what

117
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:29,038
generation are these seeds cuz that will

118
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:30,719
matter um some people are going to say

119
00:04:29,038 --> 00:04:32,599
why are you so picky why you so critical

120
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,240
about it uh that's my job to be picky

121
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,560
and critical about this part if you're

122
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,439
going to make more seeds they should be

123
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:39,519
properly labeled with the generation

124
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:41,319
that's part of what breeding is part of

125
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:44,478
what a good breeder does so just label

126
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:46,360
it properly uh that is my ramble rant

127
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:47,800
for the day all right zey trop thank you

128

140
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,038

144
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,720
this it says this is more of a breeding

145
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,840
question oh it actually starts with

146
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:27,240
greetings from Ireland big shout out to

147
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:29,318
my friends in Ireland it's great to know

148
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,199
we've got Irish Growers out there it

149
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:34,600
says this is more of a breeding question

150
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:37,120
please how do you store your pollen long

151
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:39,080
term we are still in an illegal country

152
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,519
so we have to do things on a very small

153
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:44,159
scale that's understandable also will

154
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:47,038
lemon Jeffree seeds be coming back

155
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,639
that's a very common question yes I will

156
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:51,240
make more lemon Jeffree seeds um I like

157
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:52,879
making new things I like I've only

158
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:55,079
limited I'm limited on how many things I

159
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:56,560
can make uh the lemon Jeffree is super

160
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:57,959
popular but I like making new [ __ ] I

161
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,879
will make more lemon Jeffrey is the

162
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:03,120
bottom line but it's going to be a

163
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:04,839
little while so the question here um is

164
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,598
uh how do we store pollen long term

165
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:08,638
because we're in an illegal country have

166
00:06:06,598 --> 00:06:09,800
to do things on a small scale uh yeah

167
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,400
that's a great question make sure you

168
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,840
check your inbox for the free seeds now

169
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:16,120
let's adjust or let's uh address this

170
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:18,638
question how do we store pollen long

171
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:20,720
term I recently used some pollen that

172
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,680
was stored for about a year and it did

173
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,360
not give me great results I have used

174
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:27,439
pollen that has been stored for 3 months

175
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:29,199
and 6 months the 3-month pollen seems to

176
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:31,399
be the best that six-month Mark is when

177
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:33,879
it really starts fizzling out 3 months

178
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:36,399
is good two months is cool a month is

179
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:38,159
great but after two three months I think

180
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:40,519
really it starts losing its potency it's

181
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,960
Vigor so uh don't store that pollen for

182
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:44,959
too long as my first piece of advice uh

183
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:46,478
my advice you may find better advice

184
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:49,399
that will say you can store it for a

185
00:06:46,478 --> 00:06:51,038
long time uh I can take if I take a big

186
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:53,679
bag of pollen and sprinkle it across a

187
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:55,439
room and that pollen is 2 months old uh

188
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,879
I should get so many seeds If it's 6

189
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:59,279
months old I'm going to get half as many

190
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:02,400
seeds as what I've noticed a year old I

191
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:04,598
bar got any seeds so that older pollen

192
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:06,038
it just starts to degrade it's pollen uh

193
00:07:04,598 --> 00:07:08,639
it's not going to last forever but let

194
00:07:06,038 --> 00:07:10,159
me get to my notes here um first thing

195
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,519
pollen collection a lot of this is going

196
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,840
to start when you were collecting the

197
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:15,439
pollen we've got to get that pollen bone

198
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:17,198
dry so when you collect the pollen

199
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:18,759
however you do it uh you can take it

200
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,879
from the plant while the plant is alive

201
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:22,598
and upright or you can chop the tops and

202
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:23,960
put them on a container and collect the

203
00:07:22,598 --> 00:07:26,759
pollen some sort of way on a glass

204
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:28,239
container a cardboard box um collect it

205
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:30,439
that way tap it get the pollen out let

206
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,240
it dry get more pollen one of the most

207
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:34,399
important parts is to pull out all of

208
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,879
the vegetation all of the male flowers

209
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:37,878
that are that come with your pollen get

210
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:40,000
that out of there anything green

211
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:42,360
anything leafy anything that is not

212
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,279
pollen use a sifter a screen and some

213
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,720
tweezers and get all that [ __ ] out of

214
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:48,119
there because that will contaminate your

215
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,919
pollen with moisture and moisture is one

216
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:52,840
of the number one problems the number

217
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:54,318
one Killers for this pollen so when you

218
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:56,560
collect it make sure that you get all

219
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,479
the greenery out all this male flour

220
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,439
Parts anything that contains any

221
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,758
moisture get that out of we don't want

222
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:03,800
any moisture I'm going to say that a

223
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:06,560
bunch of times we want to get this

224
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:09,879
pollen nice and dry I would recommend

225
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:12,399
adding a silicate packet if you can not

226
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:14,319
a bovita packet not a moisturizing

227
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:16,799
packet we want something to suck up the

228
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,840
moisture and make it as dry as possible

229
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,639
the silicate packs that they put in food

230
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:22,560
products the silicate packs that they

231
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,879
put in your jacket pockets when you buy

232
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,319
those they we want this nice and dry

233
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:29,879
something like that so get the pollen

234
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:32,519
dry get all the male flowers out then

235
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:34,080
put it into an airtight container uh you

236
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:36,000
can use a glass jar if that's your

237
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,240
preferred method you can use a plastic

238
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,519
baggie if that's your method sometimes a

239
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,038
plastic vessel will give you uh static

240
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:44,038
electricity and your pollen will move

241
00:08:42,038 --> 00:08:45,480
around it will be a pain in the ass so

242
00:08:44,038 --> 00:08:46,958
maybe not one of those plast I've seen

243
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,920
people try to use like a plastic peanut

244
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:50,599
butter jar and the static electricity

245
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:52,199
went crazy the pollen went everywhere it

246
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,680
probably killed the pollen if you now

247
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,560
that I'm thinking about it but I

248
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:57,399
recommend a glass jar or I've been using

249
00:08:55,559 --> 00:09:00,199
plastic baggies and putting the multiple

250
00:08:57,399 --> 00:09:02,600
plastic baggies inside of a glass jar

251
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:04,879
uh so I recommend an airtight uh

252
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,360
sealable container so we got the pollen

253
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:08,360
we've gotten all the [ __ ] out of it it's

254
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:10,639
dry now we seal it into an airtight

255
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:14,079
container uh if you can get an opaque

256
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:17,600
glass jar that would be ideal label and

257
00:09:14,078 --> 00:09:20,759
date your jar or whatever vessel you use

258
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:23,759
right uh whatever pollen arise F3 pollen

259
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:26,240
January 5th 2029 I'm just making [ __ ] up

260
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:27,720
here write the T the date and the strain

261
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,680
on there so that you've got a clear

262
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,879
indicator of what that was especially if

263
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:33,439
you're [ __ ] with more than one kind

264
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:35,480
of pollen so now we've got a dry batch

265
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,160
of pollen with silicate packs and an

266
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:40,440
opaque jar that is labeled and it's

267
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:41,799
airtight now at this point that pollen

268
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,720
is pretty preserved the best you're

269
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:46,000
going to get it now at this point I

270
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:48,360
would put it in either the crisper

271
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,240
drawer and the refrigerator or maybe

272
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:52,720
even the freezer I've done both and I've

273
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,278
had similar results with both options

274
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,959
the crisper drawer where the vegetables

275
00:09:54,278 --> 00:09:58,799
should go that's also where I keep my

276
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:59,879
seeds uh you can put the the pollen jar

277
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:01,879
right in there

278
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:03,838
uh maybe put that in a bag a brown paper

279
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:05,720
bag to keep it dark uh just add that

280
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:07,880
extra layer of Darkness cuz darkness is

281
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,959
also your enemy when it comes to pollen

282
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:12,639
so take that pollen it's dry it's got

283
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:14,479
all the [ __ ] removed it's got a silicate

284
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:16,000
packet in there it's in a dark jar it's

285
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,399
sealed it's airtight it's in a brown

286
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,519
paper bag then I put that either in my

287
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,679
freezer or in that crisper drawer and I

288
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:24,240
store it uh Mark the date on that then

289
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:25,479
you know how long it's been in there

290
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,919
have an idea of when you're going to use

291
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:29,839
it have an idea for it coming up uh cuz

292
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:31,799
it will expire so I I think that's most

293
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:34,720
of my notes it's only reliable for about

294
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:36,799
3 months maybe six uh some of the notes

295
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,879
that I definitely wrote down are once

296
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:42,559
you store this pollen in a cool dry dark

297
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:44,559
space especially if it's the freezer

298
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:47,039
don't remove it from the freezer until

299
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:49,919
it is time to use it uh I say this about

300
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:52,000
seeds as well coming from the cool into

301
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:53,519
the warm environment uh especially if

302
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,919
you're in a warm like a summer

303
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,200
environment and your fridge is nice and

304
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:58,879
cool you're going to create condensation

305
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,320
this bottle here there's no condensation

306
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:01,679
left it's been sitting out it's going to

307
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,278
show you my condensation it's been out

308
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:05,159
of the fridge for just a little bit

309
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:06,679
that'll start dripping down your jar you

310
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:09,838
don't want any of that condensation to

311
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:11,399
form near your pollen so don't pull it

312
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,519
out until you're ready to use it that

313
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:15,360
one time is just enough leave it in

314
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,600
there until it's time to pollinate then

315
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,360
go get it don't take it out and show

316
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,839
your friends a bunch of times don't get

317
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,560
it out and stare at it and think about

318
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,480
it if you put it in the freezer leave it

319
00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:25,439
in the freezer until it is it is time to

320
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:27,159
use same thing with that crisper drawer

321
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,800
we don't want to create any moisture any

322
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:32,519
condensation in that pollen I used to

323
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:35,199
say that moisture killed the pollen

324
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:38,560
that's sort of true but not accurately

325
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:40,959
true the water uh activates the pollen

326
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:43,119
and makes it do its thing so it spins

327
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:45,000
itself is kind of it activates it and

328
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,679
makes it do its process and then after

329
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
that then it's spent and it cannot be

330
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:51,439
active anymore so the way that it is

331
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,799
killing it but there's it's not it's not

332
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,000
exactly what's happening but the water

333
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:57,000
will destroy the pollen overall uh and

334
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,278
so will the light so don't let too moist

335
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,639
too much moisture get in there don't let

336
00:11:58,278 --> 00:12:01,919
any moisture get in there if you're

337
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:03,959
using the fridge technique avoid

338
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:06,439
condensation and then when you do take

339
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:07,919
out that pollen to use it if you decide

340
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:10,000
today is the day to pollinate these

341
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:12,278
plants when you remove that pollen from

342
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,360
your freezer or your refrigerator leave

343
00:12:12,278 --> 00:12:16,759
it in a room temperature area and let it

344
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:18,320
come to temperature slowly don't rush it

345
00:12:16,759 --> 00:12:19,799
don't speed it up and don't apply it to

346
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,720
the plants while it's still frozen or

347
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:23,719
still cold let it get to room

348
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:25,560
temperature slowly let it take 12 hours

349
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:27,480
if that's what it takes but let it get

350
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:29,518
to the room temperature before you apply

351
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:31,600
that pollen uh that'll help you out a

352
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:34,278
little bit as well so I think I covered

353
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:37,399
most things collect it get it dry dark

354
00:12:34,278 --> 00:12:39,879
airtight label crisper or freezer only

355
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:42,120
rely on it for two maybe three possibly

356
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:43,799
6 months at the most I used stuff that

357
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,600
was a year old and I'm not satisfied

358
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:47,399
with my results I apologize you are not

359
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,560
getting the seeds I hoped you would get

360
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:50,759
you didn't even know that they were

361
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:52,838
coming uh let it adjust to temperature

362
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:54,559
and don't pull it out of the freezer too

363
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:57,240
often that's basically my advice on

364
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:59,518
storing your pollen um I don't have a

365
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:02,079
lot of advice for much longer term wish

366
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:04,519
I did uh pollen just seems to degrade

367
00:13:02,078 --> 00:13:06,120
it's a it's a time sensitive uh product

368
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:07,399
I'm sure there's somebody out there I'm

369
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:09,720
sure that there is somebody out there

370
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:11,879
with a much more scientific approach and

371
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:13,680
scientific advice my friends I'm not

372
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:16,320
afraid of constructive criticism or to

373
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:18,919
be educated on my own show if you have a

374
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,278
better more reliable uh scientific way

375
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:22,399
that a home grower could store their

376
00:13:20,278 --> 00:13:24,000
pollen for future use the comment

377
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:26,000
section is why it open let's hear about

378
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,679
it tell me how you're storing pollen in

379
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,480
the comment section guys don't be afraid

380
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:32,120
go have a conversation down there I

381
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:33,879
encourage Community interaction speaking

382
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,320
of community interaction don't forget

383
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:37,198
about the Discord server keep this

384
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:39,000
conversation going on the Discord server

385
00:13:37,198 --> 00:13:41,120
as well uh there will be a link in the

386
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,759
show notes and in the video description

387
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,198
we've made some changes to the Discord

388
00:13:42,759 --> 00:13:46,120
come hang out the vibe is different the

389
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:47,838
crew is different uh if you're stuck on

390
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:50,198
the rules I've said this a few times we

391
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:52,040
updated the new rules and regulations uh

392
00:13:50,198 --> 00:13:53,599
the etiquette and rules it might say you

393
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:55,399
just have to reclick on that click on

394
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,320
that tab click that you agree it will

395
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:59,360
let you right back in come hang out back

396
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:01,079
on the Discord server but my friend

397
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,600
green tea out there in Ireland I think

398
00:14:01,078 --> 00:14:04,359
I've answered your question more than

399
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:06,278
thoroughly I've encouraged people to

400
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:08,120
give us feedback and now all I have to

401
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:10,958
do is send you a coupon code for a free

402
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:13,240
pack of seeds at edirect decom thank you

403
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:14,838
for the great question and uh keep the

404
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:18,240
fight going down there in Ireland but

405
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:19,680
also be very careful I admire you for

406
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,320
going down there in Ireland that is

407
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:23,239
impressive all right let's keep this

408
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:24,959
podcast moving I've got one more great

409
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:26,839
question here in front of me this

410
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:28,599
question came from my new friend eclipse

411
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:30,959
and the question goes a little bit like

412
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,519
this it says hey rosta Jeff I love the

413
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:34,479
show and I wanted to thank you for all

414
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:36,120
of the breeding knowledge you pass on in

415
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,440
every episode hey thanks for listening

416
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:39,720
and thanks for noticing that I'm trying

417
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,959
to pass on the knowledge it does go on

418
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:44,480
it says I do a little breeding myself

419
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:46,919
and I normally get seeds from seed banks

420
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,839
but I have found one or two seeds and a

421
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:50,919
few ounces of flour that I've purchased

422
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:53,240
from dispensaries yes that does happen

423
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:55,078
especially with dispensary product said

424
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:56,440
I'm assuming this was I am assuming that

425
00:14:55,078 --> 00:14:59,278
this was due to

426
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:00,759
rization possibly maybe uh there could

427
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:02,720
have been a lot of causes to this and

428
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:04,440
that's we're going to jump into that too

429
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,639
um if I'm not mistaken since it's only

430
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:08,720
one seed in the entire ounce I was

431
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:11,360
wondering if these seeds are worth a dam

432
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:13,120
because the flower was killer I've grown

433
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,399
some out in the past and everything went

434
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:18,240
smoothly should I just continue using

435
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:20,360
the cultivar if it doesn't harm or is

436
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,320
that process of seed making inducing

437
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:24,320
stress that is passed on to the next

438
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,040
generation of seeds hopefully I didn't

439
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,680
confuse you that last line did a little

440
00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:29,919
bit confuse me I think you could tell

441
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:32,198
but I understand what you're asking you

442
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:34,120
are finding seeds in your dispensary

443
00:15:32,198 --> 00:15:36,639
herb and you want to know uh are they

444
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:37,959
worth growing um first of all I want to

445
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,959
address how those seeds could have been

446
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:40,198
made because that's going to get us

447
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:42,439
further in this

448
00:15:40,198 --> 00:15:45,000
conversation that seed could have been

449
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:47,240
made from like you said rization which

450
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
is letting that plant go too long uh the

451
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:51,079
plant's natural defense mechanism is to

452
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,879
make a seed so that it can survive these

453
00:15:51,078 --> 00:15:55,838
plants main goal is to reproduce uh we

454
00:15:53,879 --> 00:15:57,759
think it's to get us High the main goal

455
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:00,639
of these plants is to reproduce to make

456
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:02,879
it to receive pollen the females is to

457
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,399
receive pollen make a seed and continue

458
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:06,679
that generation next year that's the

459
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:09,078
whole point of that female plant if that

460
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:11,479
doesn't happen the Jurassic Park effect

461
00:16:09,078 --> 00:16:13,318
will come into play sometimes uh life

462
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:15,759
will find a way they will seed

463
00:16:13,318 --> 00:16:17,759
themselves that is rization letting it

464
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,879
go long enough until it freaks out and

465
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:22,000
creates seeds on its own that is

466
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:23,198
possible it also could have been from

467
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,440
stress it could have been just a

468
00:16:23,198 --> 00:16:27,240
stressinduced panic seed it could have

469
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:30,319
been from an interex plant it could have

470
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:31,799
been from actual male pollen uh

471
00:16:30,318 --> 00:16:34,159
contacting that female plant it's

472
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:35,719
unlikely but possible also could have

473
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:37,879
been an intersex plant letting out

474
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:39,959
pollen and contacting this plant there

475
00:16:37,879 --> 00:16:42,958
are a lot of options on how this seed

476
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:44,638
could have been made so we can't assume

477
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:46,359
that we know how that seed happened even

478
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:48,560
if it was in a dispensary in a

479
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:50,000
commercial cultivation we can't assume

480
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:51,758
uh somebody could had could have had

481
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,440
pollen at home had pollen in their

482
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:55,360
dreadlocks came to the grow at work and

483
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,279
got pollen in that grow and now you've

484
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,639
got a just a straight F1 of something

485
00:16:57,278 --> 00:17:01,919
cool that they just they Seated on a AC

486
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:04,199
so what you've got we call that bag seed

487
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:06,119
since we do not know how that was made

488
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:07,400
we we kind of know it's a Mor poic

489
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:09,639
situation we don't know who the baby

490
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,919
daddy is we definitely know who mommy is

491
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,720
and you know it was good weed cuz you

492
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:14,520
smoked it and you enjoyed it but we

493
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,160
don't know who the daddy is so we call

494
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:20,000
that bag seed that's just a seed that

495
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:21,919
you found in your bag of weed um you

496
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,759
asked are they worth a damn to grow

497
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:26,480
absolutely yes grow those um don't give

498
00:17:24,759 --> 00:17:28,318
them out don't share them don't sell

499
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,160
them but if you like growing and you

500
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:31,558
find those your bag grow them that's a

501
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,919
free seed to grow that's a free

502
00:17:31,558 --> 00:17:37,918
experiment keep in mind you could have a

503
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:39,360
complete interex mutant trash plant that

504
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:42,520
grows like [ __ ] and tastes like you're

505
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:44,959
smoking cardboard and mustard or you

506
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:46,798
could have found something like uh let's

507
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,079
talk about some strains that are

508
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:51,000
legendary that were bag seed things that

509
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:52,759
were not meant to happen but are some of

510
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,319
the most popular strains on the planet

511
00:17:52,759 --> 00:17:59,000
I'm going to start with a little line

512
00:17:55,319 --> 00:18:02,639
called chem dog all of the chem line all

513
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,279
of the chem dog seeds came from bag seed

514
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,919
uh the short story is a couple dudes

515
00:18:04,279 --> 00:18:08,639
were selling uh dog Bud on the Grateful

516
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:12,159
Dead tour traveling around selling dog

517
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:13,520
butd they met a dude uh known as g g

518
00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:14,799
made friends with the boys that were

519
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:17,119
selling I'm going quickly here giving

520
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:18,639
you the quick version uh G made friends

521
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:21,239
with the boys that were selling the dog

522
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,640
Bud uh after tour G went home and

523
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:25,079
messaged the boys and said I need more

524
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,679
of that herb they sent him and it's

525
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:28,399
confusing at this point sometimes the

526
00:18:26,679 --> 00:18:30,880
story says a quarter pound sometimes the

527
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,960
story says an ounce I'm not sure

528
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:35,240
variations in the story doesn't matter

529
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,759
there were seeds in that delivery there

530
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:39,919
were 13 seeds was the legend you can

531
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:41,879
Google uh the legend of chem dog and the

532
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:43,960
13 beans and you'll find details on this

533
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:46,039
you'll find names uh you can put it all

534
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:47,720
together if you really care to do it but

535
00:18:46,038 --> 00:18:50,158
within that I need to take a little sip

536
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,159
not even going to

537
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:57,000
edit so in that delivery of herb

538
00:18:53,519 --> 00:19:01,200
allegedly there were 13 seeds from those

539
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:03,720
13 seeds we got chem dog chem 4 chem D

540
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,400
chem sis uh there were a couple of males

541
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:07,120
they got thrown away and I'm sure there

542
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:09,480
were more chem that I'm not thinking of

543
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:11,239
uh chem 991 uh that's probably my

544
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:13,599
favorite but a bunch of all the chem

545
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:15,839
stuff all the chem dog stuff came from

546
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:17,959
that bag of seeds that chem the guy

547
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:19,240
who's now known as chem dog uh he's

548
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:21,200
[ __ ] world famous in the weed

549
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:22,798
industry and the Cannabis Community for

550
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,480
finding these seeds and growing these

551
00:19:22,798 --> 00:19:27,119
out and putting these plants out into

552
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,079
the world uh for us to enjoy to smoke to

553
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:32,639
grow and most importantly to bre read

554
00:19:29,079 --> 00:19:35,519
with so all of the chem stuff was bag

555
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:37,200
seed um the guy [ __ ] found he found

556
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:39,279
these guys on tour bought herb from him

557
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,919
they sent him weed within that weed was

558
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:43,240
13 seeds he grew those because he knew

559
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:44,440
he's like I might have the weed was

560
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:46,279
excellent so he's like I might have

561
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:48,679
something and he found different

562
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:50,960
phenotypes that are we can identify the

563
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:52,320
different uh characteristics of those

564
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,360
chem lines if you put them together and

565
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:56,599
grow them and smoke them you can taste

566
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:59,359
and see and smell and feel the

567
00:19:56,599 --> 00:20:01,240
differences in the buzzes and the Aromas

568
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:03,719
uh the number four in my opinion has got

569
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:05,480
the kind of the tires and the chemical

570
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:07,759
sort of a thing and the 91 is more

571
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:09,519
skunky and a little funkier uh those are

572
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:12,240
my two favorites the kimd has got that

573
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:13,679
dies sort of a thing going on to it so

574
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,558
that's just what I've experienced when I

575
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:18,360
smoke them uh so there are differences

576
00:20:15,558 --> 00:20:20,038
and the chem dogs all of those came from

577
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:21,959
what is called a bag seed which is

578
00:20:20,038 --> 00:20:24,079
essentially what you're talking about

579
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:26,840
somebody got weed uh there was seeds in

580
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:29,639
it and they grew it so you may find uh

581
00:20:26,839 --> 00:20:31,839
also Golden Goat was an accident the

582
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:33,280
whole story about Golden Goat uh Golden

583
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:35,678
Goat was an accident that was an

584
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:37,960
accidental pollination um there was a

585
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:39,880
male in a room it pollinated a female

586
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:41,360
plant it wasn't supposed to happen the

587
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:44,120
seeds that came from that were [ __ ]

588
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:47,599
incredible so Golden Goat was a straight

589
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:49,599
up accident also Gorilla Glue was an

590
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:52,119
accident or gg4 whatever we have to call

591
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:54,000
it now to avoid getting sued was an

592
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:55,359
accident jie Wales was pretty open that

593
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,679
that was an accident I'm pretty sure he

594
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:58,918
said that that was an accident so uh

595
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:01,240
some of the best strains we we've ever

596
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:03,480
come across and if I'm wrong about gg4

597
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:06,159
cuz my brain just questioned on that um

598
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:08,480
was gg4 an uh purposeful pollination or

599
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:10,120
was that an accident uh argue about that

600
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,240
in the comments educate me I don't mind

601
00:21:10,119 --> 00:21:14,678
being updated uh but so that's what a

602
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,519
bag seat is and now you see three

603
00:21:14,679 --> 00:21:18,278
examples and I think Girl Scout cookies

604
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:20,079
was bag seed also to tell you the truth

605
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:22,079
but who the [ __ ] knows um there's a lot

606
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:25,399
of Legends around that um do your own

607
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:27,278
research there but bag seed could be uh

608
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:29,759
the new hottest [ __ ] and the great thing

609
00:21:27,278 --> 00:21:32,038
about it nobody else has it if you found

610
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:33,679
a bag seed from something maybe somebody

611
00:21:32,038 --> 00:21:36,640
else has it but what are the chances

612
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:38,360
that another guy in your re or girl uh

613
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,360
in your region went to The Dispensary

614
00:21:38,359 --> 00:21:42,240
bought the same Bud found the seeds and

615
00:21:40,359 --> 00:21:43,319
thought I should grow this also and then

616
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,079
what are the chances they're going to

617
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:46,879
find the same phenotype as you so if

618
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:48,359
you're growing in that neighborhood

619
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,480
you've got something brand new nobody

620
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:52,079
else has that it's not for sale it's not

621
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,240
available nobody even meant to give that

622
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:56,558
out you've got kind of a a prize there

623
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,319
and sometimes a phenotype a cultivar

624
00:21:56,558 --> 00:22:00,558
that nobody else has can set you apart

625
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:01,918
from the market that's why uh that's why

626
00:22:00,558 --> 00:22:04,240
everyone's looking for new [ __ ] all the

627
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:06,559
time everybody has Skittles now

628
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,759
everybody has gelato everyone's got

629
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:10,119
[ __ ] Skittles crossed to gelato now

630
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:12,158
they're looking for what do we cross it

631
00:22:10,119 --> 00:22:13,719
to next who's got the next [ __ ] because

632
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:15,120
they need the best product to set

633
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:17,440
themselves apart that's the new part of

634
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:19,798
the game all right um I feel like I

635
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,440
answered this pretty well uh is it worth

636
00:22:19,798 --> 00:22:23,879
a damn yeah grow it bro you could have

637
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,480
some amazing [ __ ] who knows what caused

638
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:27,760
that we can't assume what caused the

639
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:29,000
seed but we know that you've got it and

640
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:30,759
we know that you could grow grow it pay

641
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,038
attention though uh that could be a

642
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:35,240
crazy Herm or like we keep saying you

643
00:22:33,038 --> 00:22:36,960
could have chem dog so pay attention to

644
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:39,278
that I think I've answered this question

645
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,798
quite well my new friend Eclipse uh make

646
00:22:39,278 --> 00:22:42,759
sure you check your inbox because you've

647
