209
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:18,159
the audio quality is great with the

210
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:20,239
lapel mic thank you because i got

211
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,240
mixed feedback and mixed emotions it

212
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,400
says i feel like the standalone mic had

213
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,360
more crisp audio quality but regardless

214
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:26,799
it sounds great

215
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,720
and i would imagine it would be perfect

216
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,680
for indulging during the show yes it

217
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,080
makes it easier

218
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,240
to dab it makes it easier to just move

219
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:35,918
my arms around i smack this mic a lot

220
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,079
just more comfortable you take up a lot

221
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:39,519
of desk space yeah and if you don't stay

222
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:40,959
on it right here like i keep reminding

223
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:42,399
mike then you can't hear us and we start

224
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:44,318
sounding like [ __ ] so

225
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:45,758
um but yeah the lapel mic is a new

226
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,360
experience it's more comfortable

227
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,960
there's nothing in my face i can talk

228
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,319
with my hands i can definitely dab a

229
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:51,839
little bit more it makes it more

230
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,520
conversational if there's somebody in

231
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:54,959

thinking about healing

314
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:18,479
and thinking about making people feel

315
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:21,359
good and when they're in the grow

316

they're just beaming and smiling i'm not

317
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,879
impressed with the people who are

318
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:26,079
growing for their wallet the guys that

319
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:28,000
are walking around going

320
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,519
i'm sure there's four pounds here and

321
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,958
i'm gonna sell each pound for three

322
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,879
thousand i've got twelve thousand

323

dollars i'm gonna buy this

324
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:36,240
those guys haven't earned my love and

325
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,759

326
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,600
you get excited you get a little bit of

327
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:41,278
money your heart starts pumping

328
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,639

329
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:43,439
from your heart go back into that grow

330
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:45,360
room and think about

331
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,200
how many people are going to feel better

332
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,639
when they consume that product

333
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,080
that's what i think it's all about we're

334
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:51,679
making people we are improving the

335
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,160
quality of people's lives if it's our

336
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:53,519
own

337
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:55,360
if it's medical patients if it's

338
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,120
recreational patients if it's

339
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,959
those people's families mike are your

340
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,000
kids lives better because you consume

341
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:02,639
cannabis

342
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,039
much yeah yeah so it's a change much

343
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:06,078
better

344
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:07,599
it's a ripple effect so those are the

345
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:09,039
breeders that i've got the most love and

346
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,040
respect for the guys that are

347
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:12,799
uh growing with love and thinking about

348
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:13,278
healing not the guys growing from their

349
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:14,719
ego

350
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:16,320
or thinking about dollars and their

351
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,240
wallets if you're growing uh

352
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,160
from your dick to get chicks if you're

353
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,600
grown from your wallet to get cars

354
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:22,958
like that's the wrong approach think

355
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,240
about cannabis if you're breeding

356
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:26,000
especially think about

357
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,159
improving cannabis that's our goal it's

358
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,039
like art it's like we're chefs we're

359
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:30,319
artists we're

360
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:32,879
all kinds of different things rolled

361
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,480
into one as breeders so to give kind of

362
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:35,838
a generic answer

363
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,519
and a kind of a disclaimer that i'm

364
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,360
gonna miss a lot of people in this

365
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,440
list but that is what i look for a

366
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,879
breeder that uh contributes to the

367
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,240
community a breeder that's been around

368
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:46,078
for a while a breeder that has put out

369
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,039
strains that are worth something not

370
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:48,879
people that come and

371
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:50,719
chuck pollen and say here's the most

372
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:52,559
popular candy flavored strain and the

373
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,839
most popular whatever flavored strain we

374
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:54,639
put them together we put them out we

375
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,000
didn't test them

376
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:57,519
we're gonna sell a [ __ ] ton of seeds and

377
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,559
guess what next year you'll never know

378
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,159
who we are

379
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:02,078
that's a whole different group of people

380
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,639
so let's talk about people that i've

381
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:04,879
really

382
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:06,639
got some respect for in the middle of my

383
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:08,159
list i want to go ladies first i just

384
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:09,519
realized i wrote her down in the middle

385
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:10,958
of the list but she's going to deserve a

386
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,480
top spot right now let's give a shout

387
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:15,039
out to miss jill

388
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,480
miss jill is uh not only it doesn't it

389
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:17,838
shouldn't even count that she's a badass

390
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,839
woman grower but there aren't enough

391
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,680
badass women growers the women get

392
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,600
overlooked it's kind of a boys club

393
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:25,199
so shout out to miss jill i've got a lot

394
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,159
of respect as for miss jill

395
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,800
as a grower and a breeder when subby was

396
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:30,639
in prison

397
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:32,399
shout out to subcool subcool taught me a

398
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:34,639
lot when subby was in prison

399
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,440
jill was getting cultivation books about

400
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:37,600
cannabis

401
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,200
and substituting all of the words that

402
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,959
weren't allowed in prison with the word

403
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,000
blueberries or whatever else so that she

404
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:44,319
could get those books

405
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,559
to subby while he was incarcerated to

406
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,879
keep his cannabis education growing

407
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:50,319
if that's not contributing to cannabis i

408
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:52,639
don't know what is that's being

409
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,160
a badass partner a badass cannabis

410
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:55,600
person just that's being a bad

411
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:57,120
[ __ ] in general so

412
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,800
jill deserves a little shout out and

413
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,360
recognition for that

414
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:02,000
then on top of that she is a badass

415
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,560
breeder

416
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,559
a lot of us smoke jelly bean we see a

417
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:08,799
lot of crosses with jelly bean actually

418
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:10,638
this jar right here orangutan funk is

419
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:13,359
jelly bean number 13

420
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,000
cross 2 grease monkey and the jelly bean

421
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,079
gives it

422
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,919
such a delicious flavor a lot of people

423
00:12:16,078 --> 00:12:19,120
are chasing that jelly bean terp

424
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:21,360
i know a guy who's got a breeding

425
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,959
company based off of jelly beans so jill

426
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,200
created jelly bean

427
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:27,119
jill was a big part of tga team green

428
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,360
avengers it wasn't just sub cool

429
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,839
so jill gets a lot of credit for that

430
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,240
jill is also now making more crosses

431
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:34,240
with

432
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,079
the jelly bean and other crosses so she

433
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,639
deserves a big shout out she is a

434
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:38,559
breeder

435
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,240
that i appreciate and trust and respect

436
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:40,879
as a person and as a grower and a

437
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,799
breeder

438
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:44,240
she's got reputable lines she's

439
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:46,000
contributed to the industry

440
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,360
and she's not full of [ __ ] she's still

441
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,120
here longetivity

442
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,959
i think shows a lot in this industry

443
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,720
like i said a moment ago people come

444
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:54,239
they do [ __ ] at a booth for one year you

445
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,040
see them bang it out next year they're

446
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,959
not there

447
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:58,639
and they they made enough money in that

448
00:12:56,958 --> 00:13:00,479
one year to kind of cover that year but

449
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:02,159
you need longevity to have a business

450
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,680
one year isn't [ __ ] in a business that's

451
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:04,719
just coming and going that's a one hit

452
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:06,799
wonder

453
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,720

that [ __ ] brash new york accent

664
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,240
and i love it like i love it just

665
00:19:08,798 --> 00:19:12,000
something about when people speak

666
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,720
differently i'm drawn to them so

667
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,480
he breeds well he speaks his mind he

668
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,279
deserves the respect he's been around

669
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,720
for a long time

670
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:20,480
all these guys i'm talking about you've

671
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,000
seen their names and their [ __ ] on

672
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,759
advertising and on signs because they've

673
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,798
been around for a long time so those

674
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:27,119
folks all get

675
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:29,038
some huge respect uh there was one more

676
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:30,719
guy i wanted to mention his name left my

677
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:34,240
brain while i was talking

678
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:36,960
uh but i did write down kevin jodrey

679
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,240
dude kevin jodry uh is a breeder a

680
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,279
grower a cultivator

681
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:43,839
a [ __ ] a hustler a career hustler

682
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:45,200
uh a badass [ __ ] in general that

683
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:47,119
is one of the people that i really think

684
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,640
is moving the industry the community and

685
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:51,119
the plant forward so

686
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,000
uh he does so much he talks he teaches

687
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:54,399
he breeds

688
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,798
he is i think he is what i was aspiring

689
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,559
to be before i even knew he existed so

690
00:19:56,798 --> 00:20:00,480
uh kevin jodrey is another person that

691
00:19:58,558 --> 00:20:02,079
i've got a lot of respect for and look

692
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,440
up to as a grower and breeder

693
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:05,279
so i feel like there was one more name

694
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,000
in there that i wanted to shout out but

695
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:08,558
it left my

696
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
brain it may have been uh big mike from

697
00:20:08,558 --> 00:20:11,759
exotic he's killing it

698
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,038
um i'm sure there are more out there

699
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:14,240

breeders out there matt riot

724
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,558
let's include matt ryan and then we're

725
00:20:48,558 --> 00:20:53,440
going to move forward matt riot

726
00:20:50,558 --> 00:20:55,119
has a very unique personality matt riot

727
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,919
has no fear to tell somebody to go [ __ ]

728
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:58,239
themselves

729
00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:00,080
matt wright is very opinionated but also

730
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,240
very educated and i like the way he does

731
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:04,480
his thing he's a good breeder uh he

732
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,240
breeds quality he only releases quality

733
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,000
he understands the plant he understands

734
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,919
the community and he understands the

735
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,960
history and importance of cannabis

736
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:14,880
so he is on my list of breeders that i

737
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,720
trust love and respect you're on there

738
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,320
matt um even though you're

739
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,319
[ __ ] opinionated and you got your

740
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:21,678
personality i respect that like i said

741
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:23,119
earlier people with a personality that

742
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:24,720
tell you to go [ __ ] yourself

743
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:26,558
that means a lot to me that's integrity

744
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,919
so even though he may have told a lot of

745
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:28,798
people to [ __ ] themselves and he ruffles

746
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,559
a lot of feathers

747
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:32,079
doesn't bother me one bit all right

748
00:21:30,558 --> 00:21:33,759
we're gonna move on from the

749
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:35,359
breeders that i love and respect and

750
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:37,200
appreciate i want to thank our friend

751
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:38,479
senzu for the great message that got me

752
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,960
going on a long rant

753
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,480
uh thank you i appreciate that uh big

754
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,600
shout out to all the breeders out there

755
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,919
growing from their heart doing it

756
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:47,199
because they mean it all right mike

757
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:48,320
you're doing well your technical glitch

758
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,240
is catching up

759
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:51,678
doing good it's been smooth we uh just a

760
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,880
little lag issue we're good

761
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:54,320
all right all right it's probably

762
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,840
because it's our neighborhood where we

763
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:57,200
are about this time we start getting a

764
00:21:55,839 --> 00:21:59,199
little glitchy

765
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,240
uh let's jump into another message that

766
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,480
came from our friend

767
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,919
c dub in michigan this is a great

768
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,240
message mike i thought you may have some

769
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:06,880
good

770
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,759
insight on this one this one says ross

771
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,919
to jeff

772
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:12,158
disabled veterans are close to my heart

773
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:14,000
and that of my family and i try to keep

774
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:15,679
i try to help them establish medical

775
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
grows whenever i can

776
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:20,640
for many reasons these men and women the

777
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,558
cost of equipment is simply too much

778
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,640
i would like to organize a cooperative

779
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:26,639
amongst growers that would directly

780
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,480
that would direct older but usable

781
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,960
equipment from growers who were trading

782
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,279
up

783
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,480
to this group of veterans many of whom

784
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:34,879
will suffer

785
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,599
uh who will suffer and continuing

786
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,760
medical

787
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:39,439
need how would you organize such an

788
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:40,000
effort and how would you reach out to

789
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,038
those

790
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:46,079
that have on behalf of those who

791
00:22:43,038 --> 00:22:47,038
don't from cdub and michigan so this is

792
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:49,038
a great idea

793
00:22:47,038 --> 00:22:50,798
we got a very compassionate person here

794
00:22:49,038 --> 00:22:53,200
our friend cdub wants to know

795
00:22:50,798 --> 00:22:54,400
how they can create a program to get

796
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,480
grow equipment

797
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,080
from growers hands who are done with

798
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,599
that equipment they're upgrading maybe

799
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:00,319
they've given up maybe they've got some

800
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:01,759
new [ __ ]

801
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:03,519
they want to move that old equipment

802
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:05,038
instead of throwing it away putting it

803
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:06,000
in the dumpster they want to get it to

804
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:07,919
veterans who are

805
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,359
then able to grow their own medicine

806
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,400
because a lot of these veterans are on a

807
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:11,839
fixed income

808
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,440
they're getting social security or

809
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:15,439
disability checks possibly

810
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,038
and that doesn't go very far these days

811
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,640
so they need a little bit of cannabis

812
00:23:17,038 --> 00:23:20,640
and growing it themselves would be the

813
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,679
perfect way to do it we just need to get

814
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,000
them equipment

815
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:25,840
so what are some great ways we could

816
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,480
think of to kind of organize

817
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:29,918
a cooperative and get some used but

818
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,599
still usable equipment

819
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:33,440
into the hands of these people who

820
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:34,959
helped us out mike you have any ideas

821
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,000
for me because i wrote down a few things

822
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,720
it's

823
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,119
this is a tricky one because of the the

824
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,640
grow

825
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:46,158
community tends to be rightly so

826
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:47,600
quite paranoid um and so

827
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:49,760
getting a whole bunch of people to

828
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:51,278
gather together and say hey we all grow

829
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:54,158
cannabis

830
00:23:51,278 --> 00:23:55,359
um is tricky and it kind of for any

831
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:59,039
reason

832
00:23:55,359 --> 00:24:01,759
um and then to to double down on the

833
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:04,079
the difficulty you're adding and asking

834
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:07,200
for donations

835
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:09,359
donations of expensive equipment

836
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,120
so it's going to be all about building

837
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:14,158
personal relationships with

838
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:17,519
existing growers and

839
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:19,039
prospective growers and figuring out who

840
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:22,158
needs what and who has

841
00:24:19,038 --> 00:24:24,879
what extra um and and

842
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:25,919
helping putting people either um helping

843
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,480
make the switch

844
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:29,840
or putting people in contact with each

845
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,440
other

846
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:33,519
it's you're gonna have to build your

847
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,480
friends list man yeah i hadn't

848
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:36,158
considered the

849
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,839
legality part i don't know if you're in

850
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:38,320
prohibition land or if you're in a green

851
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:40,480
state

852
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:42,960
but that's going to play a big factor

853
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:45,679
into how this program works out

854
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,079
yep i've tried to wrangle growers for

855
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:47,759
stuff

856
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:50,399
before and when i'm like hey i need a

857
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:53,038
whole bunch of people to come and

858
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:55,200
and stand up and say hey we grow and

859
00:24:53,038 --> 00:24:58,480
immediately the room gets empty

860
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:00,159
right it's it's

861
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,839
my idea was maybe these people out you

862
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:03,200
could post something to craigslist where

863
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:03,839
people are buying and selling grow

864
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,400
equipment

865
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:07,278
and just post your idea just say hey i'm

866
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,120
i've got veteran

867
00:25:07,278 --> 00:25:10,640
a veteran friend here who can use some

868
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:11,839
equipment if you've got any

869
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,038
old equipment that you're willing to

870
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:14,399
donate or if you're going to throw it

871
00:25:13,038 --> 00:25:14,879
away or whatever maybe we could give it

872
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,798
to this

873
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,919
veteran so you can craigslist may be a

874
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:19,839
good spot to start

875
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:21,759
and then maybe maybe facebook maybe you

876
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:24,399
could start a facebook group for

877
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:26,000
veterans in need of grow equipment or

878
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,278
veterans cannabis alliance or something

879
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,319
that's probably already taken that came

880
00:25:27,278 --> 00:25:30,400
out too naturally

881
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:31,439
but some sort of veterans and cannabis

882
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,278
and something to

883
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,200
veterans grow initiative something like

884
00:25:33,278 --> 00:25:37,359
that the gi grow

885
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,038
there you go the gi growth something

886
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:40,719
like that to get just to help get them

887
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:42,000
some equipment so maybe post something

888
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,600
to craigslist maybe social

889
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,278
media like facebook is always a place to

890
00:25:43,599 --> 00:25:47,278
start start a group on there

891
00:25:45,278 --> 00:25:48,720
um then go invite all of your veteran

892
00:25:47,278 --> 00:25:50,720
friends then by

893
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,000
invite all of your grower friends if you

894
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,278
know any of the two if you've got an

895
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,159
overlap that's a good way to get it

896
00:25:53,278 --> 00:25:57,278
started

897
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:58,320
then maybe um some of the dispensaries

898
00:25:57,278 --> 00:25:59,679
and grow stores

899
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:02,240
have message boards where you can

900
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:03,759
actually make a note on paper and put it

901
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,558
on a bulletin board with these old

902
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:06,879
things they call

903
00:26:04,558 --> 00:26:08,240
push pins yeah some places still have

904
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,600
that i know a lot of the music stores

905
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,558
put that in the back so you can look for

906
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:12,798
a band

907
00:26:10,558 --> 00:26:13,759
maybe some of the grocery stores yeah

908
00:26:12,798 --> 00:26:15,359
yeah so maybe you can go to the

909
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:15,919
dispensary maybe you can go to the groce

910
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:17,839
store

911
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:19,679
and maybe put up a little flyer or

912
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:21,519
something like that saying hey i know

913
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:22,960
uh don't throw away that old grow gear

914
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:24,639
you buy a new gear don't throw that old

915
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,079
stuff away give it to a veteran in need

916
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,120
and help a veteran grow some weed or

917
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:28,558
something like that

918
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:30,719
then just put your number on there or

919
00:26:28,558 --> 00:26:32,319
something and then you can be the middle

920
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,759
man you just go collect all that gear

921
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:34,639
and then you just take it to the vets as

922
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:37,200
they need it

923
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,080
or maybe maybe you can find some veteran

924
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,759
groups or maybe

925
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:41,918
the va hospital or something will help

926
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:44,480
you out maybe if it's a legal

927
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:45,600
medical cannabis market a good place

928
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,759
where i like to leave

929
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:49,918
podcast advertising and business cards

930
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:51,919
is the medical marijuana doctor

931
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:53,440
every time i go there i make sure to

932
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:55,120
leave a couple of business cards there

933
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,720
so they know you can hit me up for seeds

934
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:58,479
and i leave podcast ads there

935
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,839
because those are new consumers they're

936
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,200
getting their cards i know they're gonna

937
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:03,759
smoke possibly grow

938
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,400
so that's a great place to go so i don't

939
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:06,640
have

940
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,320
a good strategy or plan for you but i

941
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,320
think social media

942
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:12,480
and craigslist are a great way to start

943
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:13,519
this uh then like mike said just build

944
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,798
your friends list you're gonna have to

945
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:15,918
get out there and let people know what

946
00:27:14,798 --> 00:27:17,679
you're doing

947
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:20,080
maybe you can do a thing with the grow

948
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:23,120
store maybe you've got a friend

949
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:23,759
at a local growth store who you can get

950
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:26,158
them

951
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:28,000
to give a discount maybe five or ten

952
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:29,520
percent or maybe you get a free piece of

953
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,440
merchandise a little you know just a

954
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:33,359
tiny freebie that people can get

955
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,640
if they contribute their old gear when

956
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:36,719
they buy new gear

957
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,559
like bring your old light get 10 off on

958
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,480
your new light or something like that

959
00:27:38,558 --> 00:27:42,000
maybe you can get a store to run a

960
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,440
special like that and help you out

961
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,960
i don't know if you've got friends or

962
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,759
access like that but that's when friends

963
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,759
come into play

964
00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:49,038
that's when stuff like this helps maybe

965
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:50,960
maybe you'll find that one of the grow

966
00:27:49,038 --> 00:27:52,398
stores in town is ran by an old veteran

967
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,960
and he'll be like oh that's an amazing

968
00:27:52,398 --> 00:27:54,479
idea

969
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,600
maybe he's got the same kind of passion

970
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,720
that you do mike i hear your stuff

971
00:27:55,599 --> 00:27:58,959
glitching out so i'm going to slow down

972
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,880
and let the recording catch up

973
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,919
is your gear good buddy yeah i think we

974
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,679
sound good i just don't want to miss

975
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:06,799
anything in the recording

976
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:07,278
it's still good on my end sweet all

977
00:28:06,798 --> 00:28:08,639
right so

978
00:28:07,278 --> 00:28:10,240
carl i think we have answered your

979
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,440
question to the best of our ability

980
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,759
you're going to have to do some ground

981
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,240
work

982
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:15,759
maybe make some phone calls social media

983
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,480
get out there and let people know what

984
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:18,879
your mission

985
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,839
is and then once it starts happening it

986
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,278
will snowball

987
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:23,359
once people know what you're doing you

988
00:28:21,278 --> 00:28:24,798
start building a following it will start

989
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:25,759
flowing that's all you got to do is get

990
00:28:24,798 --> 00:28:27,519
it rolling

991
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:29,038
uh so that's my advice get it started

992
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:30,000
bro maybe go make a facebook group

993
00:28:29,038 --> 00:28:32,319
create a craigslist

994
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,240
post and then find people on both ends

995
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:34,798

one says

1010
00:28:56,798 --> 00:29:01,240
hey ross to jeff they legalized

1011
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,640
recreational cannabis here in maine in

1012
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,960
2016.

1013
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,679
since then i've been very

1014
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:08,000
enthusiastically trying to learn

1015
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:10,080
everything i can about growing bro there

1016
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,079
is a lot to learn keep sucking it in

1017
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:13,759
it goes on to say i've enjoyed the plant

1018
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:15,599
for a long time but i was afraid to try

1019
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:16,158
growing when it was illegal smart move

1020
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:18,959
that is

1021
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:20,159
that's a risky move sometimes it says i

1022
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,278
have a job where i can listen to

1023
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:23,200
headphones at work

1024
00:29:21,278 --> 00:29:25,440
so when they legalized i began listening

1025
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,880
to podcasts about growing that is the

1026
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,320
wife when he just put in earbuds and

1027
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,159
just go all day

1028
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:33,359
yeah i think i first discovered your

1029
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:35,278
podcast sometime around 2017 or 18

1030
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:36,558
and began listening to blocks of early

1031
00:29:35,278 --> 00:29:39,119
episodes on youtube

1032
00:29:36,558 --> 00:29:40,319
to learn to to learn and pass the time

1033
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:42,798
while at work

1034
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:43,678
i went as far back as the igrow culture

1035
00:29:42,798 --> 00:29:47,200
episodes

1036
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:48,960
nice yeah so just an update

1037
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,640
yeah when the podcast first started i

1038
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,798
called it i grow culture a play on the

1039
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,159
word agriculture and i grow because

1040
00:29:52,798 --> 00:29:57,519
everything at the time had the i

1041
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:58,559
iphone irig i everything uh so i wanted

1042
00:29:57,519 --> 00:30:01,038
to play with that

1043
00:29:58,558 --> 00:30:01,759
then i did get a message from a company

1044
00:30:01,038 --> 00:30:05,038
who makes

1045
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:07,278
um educational programs for schools

1046
00:30:05,038 --> 00:30:08,640
and they were called the igrow culture

1047
00:30:07,278 --> 00:30:10,480
institute or something and they're like

1048
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,120
you can't do that anymore or we will sue

1049
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,558
you

1050
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:13,918
and i was like oh cool i wanted to

1051
00:30:12,558 --> 00:30:14,639
change the name anyway i didn't like

1052
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:16,559
that anymore

1053
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,159
so at episode 50 we changed the name to

1054
00:30:16,558 --> 00:30:20,480
grow from your heart that's where the

1055
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:22,399
agro culture part comes in

1056
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:24,240
now that you're caught up on history it

1057
00:30:22,398 --> 00:30:25,678
says i heard your episode about how you

1058
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,038
named strains today if you've been

1059
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:29,120
listening to the show a recent episode

1060
00:30:27,038 --> 00:30:31,599
was how about about how i name strange

1061
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:33,199
episode thank you bro it goes on saying

1062
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:34,959
i found myself agreeing with you that

1063
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,720
names of strains are important

1064
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,000
i'm glad you give some thought to the

1065
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,759
names you choose

1066
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,519
if i had one piece of advice to give

1067
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:42,158
people naming strains of cannabis it

1068
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:44,480
would be

1069
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:45,679
try to pick something classy and

1070
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,919
creative

1071
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:49,919
yes um something that stands out

1072
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:51,600
something that doesn't scare people away

1073
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:55,120
we often forget

1074
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:58,079
that the main demographic of cannabis

1075
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:58,959
is 18 to 40 year old bros that's mostly

1076
00:30:58,079 --> 00:31:02,000
who's smoking

1077
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:04,000
and mostly 25 to 40 year old bros

1078
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,679
and not that's just the demographic if

1079
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,119
you look up cannabis study

1080
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:09,519
that's who's mostly into it there's the

1081
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:10,079
fringe the older demographic is getting

1082
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:11,839
larger

1083
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:13,519
the lady demographic is getting larger

1084
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:15,759
but it's mostly bros

1085
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:16,880
we forget that we need to remember that

1086
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:19,278
there are ladies

1087
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,159
there are older folks in here there are

1088
00:31:19,278 --> 00:31:22,079
not bros

1089
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:24,559
that are consuming cannabis now this is

1090
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:26,798
becoming a popular commercial commodity

1091
00:31:24,558 --> 00:31:29,038
we need to not scare the ladies away i

1092
00:31:26,798 --> 00:31:30,639
had a close friend who was a lady grower

1093
00:31:29,038 --> 00:31:32,879
tell me that she didn't like my stream

1094
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,519
bounty killer because of the name bounty

1095
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,600
killer

1096
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:36,798
i named it after a reggae artist who is

1097
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:39,599
called bounty killer

1098
00:31:36,798 --> 00:31:40,798
and also it makes big fat harvests so i

1099
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:42,879
thought it was appropriate

1100
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:44,079
she said i wish it had a better more

1101
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,240
gentle name so

1102
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:48,000
if we adjust we may be able to get more

1103
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,880
ladies more older folk into our

1104
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,558
demographic

1105
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,080
a lot of if you're a seed breeder you're

1106
00:31:50,558 --> 00:31:53,519
trying to sell you got to broaden your

1107
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:54,000
audience so let me get back on track

1108
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:55,919
here

1109
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,240
it says try to pick something classy and

1110
00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:00,640
creative it says don't pick names like

1111
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:01,519
green crack or donkey dick or crystal

1112
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,440
meth

1113
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:05,599
i [ __ ] completely agree green crack

1114
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:08,000
is kind of uh which makes it where if

1115
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:10,480
the guy who named green crack had named

1116
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,440
it like strawberry starburst or some

1117
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,038
[ __ ]

1118
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,798
we would be legal in like three more

1119
00:32:13,038 --> 00:32:15,839
states at least right and it may have

1120
00:32:14,798 --> 00:32:17,119
been on more shelves and more

1121
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:20,240
dispensaries

1122
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:23,678
it did get renamed the name status back

1123
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:26,240
it's yeah perception's a thing and it's

1124
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:27,519
it's real and it has legit effects yeah

1125
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,519
and if uh

1126
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:31,120
and now if you ever hear the word uh the

1127
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:33,120
mellow that was

1128
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:34,959
green crack they renamed it to the melo

1129
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:36,719
after carmelo anthony because green

1130
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,159
crack was his favorite strain is what i

1131
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,798
think i read that's a weird nugget of

1132
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:40,880
cannabis

1133
00:32:38,798 --> 00:32:43,440
info there don't pick names like green

1134
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,080
crack or donkey dick or crystal meth i

1135
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,919
agree

1136
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:47,519
uh donkey dick is kind of maybe it made

1137
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:49,200
big giant buds but still

1138
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:50,798
and green crack was called green crack

1139
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,159
because it made little tiny rocks that

1140
00:32:50,798 --> 00:32:53,918
were super hard

1141
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:56,320
and everybody wanted it so it's green

1142
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:59,440
crack the donkey dick makes big buds

1143
00:32:56,319 --> 00:33:01,759
crystal meth let's not do that but

1144
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:03,038
that's another drug let's not do that

1145
00:33:01,759 --> 00:33:04,558
yeah you don't even have to ever type

1146
00:33:03,038 --> 00:33:06,798
those words together

1147
00:33:04,558 --> 00:33:07,918
um somebody recently asked me if i was

1148
00:33:06,798 --> 00:33:09,918

1149
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:11,519

want to compare this wonderful plant

1160
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,880
with such a horrible drug like crack or

1161
00:33:30,398 --> 00:33:32,639
meth

1162
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,320
just the name green crack actually made

1163
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,720
me angry when i first heard of it

1164
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:38,000
and it still kind of pisses me off i

1165
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,558
don't know that it pisses me off but it

1166
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,240
does like

1167
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:42,079
rub me wrong i don't want to hear people

1168
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:44,960
say that like just don't

1169
00:33:42,079 --> 00:33:46,720
don't say those words it goes on to say

1170
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,960
i think names like this work against

1171
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:50,079
cannabis being accepted and legalized in

1172
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,919
more places

1173
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:53,759
don't help those idiots to keep it

1174
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:56,080
illegal mike you and i you and this guy

1175
00:33:53,759 --> 00:33:57,919
were on the exact same page

1176
00:33:56,079 --> 00:33:59,519
uh then it says don't give them fire

1177
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:01,120
they got plenty exactly

1178
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:02,480
yeah yeah i'm a white guy with

1179
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:04,239
dreadlocks i have to speak clearly

1180
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:06,159
because if i went up and said bro

1181
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,919
and they already expected that from me

1182
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:08,800
so it says here's the thing eventually i

1183
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:10,480
started hearing

1184
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,159
good things about green crack from some

1185
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,440
sources so it got me thinking that maybe

1186
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:14,559
there were good strains out there which

1187
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,079
i were avoiding

1188
00:34:14,559 --> 00:34:18,559
simply because i thought the name was

1189
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:20,800
stupid or silly thinking about it more i

1190
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:23,039
know there must be yeah i'm sure that

1191
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:25,119
some strain names have scared me away

1192
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:26,559
um maybe there were some great seeds

1193
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:28,320
that i didn't buy just because the name

1194
00:34:26,559 --> 00:34:30,078
was stupid or something like that

1195
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,599
i think that that is definitely a thing

1196
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:33,119
so i'm glad that you agree with me that

1197
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:35,440
it's very important

1198
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:36,559
not only for marketing and for as from a

1199
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,878
marketing standpoint

1200
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:40,480
point but from a cultural and an

1201
00:34:38,878 --> 00:34:41,918
observation standpoint the people

1202
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,119
looking in on us like well they like to

1203
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:45,279
smoke green crack

1204
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:47,039
it just doesn't [ __ ] sound good

1205
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:49,839
doesn't sound good

1206
00:34:47,039 --> 00:34:50,800
uh one of the the anti-pot groups here

1207
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:53,358
in colorado

1208
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,800
has been desperate to get all sorts all

1209
00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:57,920
concentrates

1210
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:59,680
they want the to double crack weed

1211
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,680
and it's it's been funny to watch them

1212
00:34:59,679 --> 00:35:02,000
try to get this to catch on for the last

1213
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:05,279
four

1214
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:07,280
years um

1215
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,880
it's just some [ __ ] just won't catch on

1216
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,000
and another [ __ ] catches on right away

1217
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:13,280
and it's just

1218
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:17,838
you can't force it kevin jodrey kevin

1219
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:17,839
jojo's closest with creeps

1220
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:22,480
yeah no it's not going to set us forward

1221
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:25,200
at all

1222
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:26,639
the the optics of dabbing are very very

1223
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:29,199
tricky to explain to

1224
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:30,799
to non-consumers yeah the first time you

1225
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:32,159
bust out that dab torch and you start

1226
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,480
heating up that nail people like

1227

right off the start yeah but if you love

1254

just uh

1267
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:50,960
um i feel like this has been my little

1268
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,760
mike's moment three or four times in a

1269
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:54,079
row but

1270
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:55,680
i went herb shopping again at a bunch of

1271
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:58,800
local shops and

1272
00:36:55,679 --> 00:37:02,879
man trim your [ __ ] weed oh yeah um

1273
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:04,000
also if marijuana is legal where you're

1274
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,920
at

1275
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,519
and you're wondering about how to

1276
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:10,240
attract

1277
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:12,159
more consumers to your business the

1278
00:37:10,239 --> 00:37:14,799
trick is to put good products at

1279
00:37:12,159 --> 00:37:16,719
reasonable prices on the shelves

1280
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:18,560
like that's i don't want to give away

1281
00:37:16,719 --> 00:37:21,679
the secret to business

1282
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:23,199
for free but there [ __ ] is people put

1283
00:37:21,679 --> 00:37:25,039
good herb on the shelf at a reasonable

1284
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:27,358
price

1285
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:29,679
if you build it they will come that's

1286
00:37:27,358 --> 00:37:31,838
the truth quit focusing on random crazy

1287
00:37:29,679 --> 00:37:33,759
products and weird advertising tactics

1288
00:37:31,838 --> 00:37:35,199
and [ __ ] fancy artwork on the sides

1289
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,800
of your building and

1290
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:38,319
put some cool product on the shelf and

1291
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:40,400
we will come and buy it

1292
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:41,680
put good herb in the put good herb on

1293
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,880
the shelf that's that's really all you

1294
00:37:41,679 --> 00:37:44,480
got to do

1295
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,559
excellent mike i appreciate that inside

1296
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,760

1297
00:37:46,559 --> 00:37:49,199

1299
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:51,759
route um

1300
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:53,039

1301
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,880
interesting and if you're looking for a

1302
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:55,920
more militant a militant version of

1305
00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:02,320
you on facebook

1306
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:03,839
pueblo for sensible cannabis laws but uh

1307
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,680
it's been pretty quiet lately because i

1308
00:38:03,838 --> 00:38:08,320
haven't felt much like

1309
00:38:05,679 --> 00:38:09,679
facebook written lately i've had to just

1310
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:13,440
kind of stay off of facebook

1311
00:38:09,679 --> 00:38:16,399
lately i'm almost done with it

1312
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:18,240
i'm i'm flirting with being done i i've

1313
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:20,559
kind of stopped posting photos

1314
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:22,879
and that's what i used it for was

1315
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:26,960
keeping family updated on kid stuff

1316
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:27,838
and family stuff but i stopped because i

1317
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,920
don't want to

1318
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:31,599
come across photos of my kids used in

1319
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,000
promotional advertising for products

1320
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:34,720
somewhere

1321
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,760
else because that's how facebook works

1322
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:37,279
like

1323
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:39,119
if you have a facebook account you're

1324
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:41,920
the [ __ ] product

1325
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:43,920
that's how social media works so i've

1326
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,838
been posting less and less especially

1327
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:49,280
imagery and

1328
00:38:45,838 --> 00:38:50,559
yeah it's evil just go post random fish

1329
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,000
lyrics just to let people know what i

1330
00:38:50,559 --> 00:38:53,519
was listening to in the car that's

1331
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,519
usually what that nonsense that four

1332
00:38:53,519 --> 00:38:56,079
nonsensical words in a row usually fish

1333
00:38:55,519 --> 00:38:58,480
lyrics

1334
00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:00,160
every time i post song lyrics i get

1335
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:02,880
three private messages they're like are

1336
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:05,279
you okay bro

1337
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:06,880
we listen to different music yeah i'm

1338
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:09,359
avoiding social media because in the

1339
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,640
in the growing groups i see the craziest

1340
00:39:09,358 --> 00:39:13,519
stuff and

1341
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:15,039
so the growing groups are just so toxic

1342
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:16,000
i don't have time to correct all of that

1343
00:39:15,039 --> 00:39:17,838
[ __ ] so i just

1344
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,760
click back out and i'm done with it for

1345
00:39:17,838 --> 00:39:21,119
a minute come to a podcast and talk

1346
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,720
about real stuff instead of trying to

1347
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:24,720
feel all that nonsense there

1348
00:39:22,719 --> 00:39:26,319
that's what inspired the uh the outdoor

1349
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:29,838
episode last time

1350
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:33,440
yeah i liked that rant it uh

1351
00:39:29,838 --> 00:39:36,239
um the key to a good grow is planning

1352
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:37,519
in in prep work and then just

1353
00:39:36,239 --> 00:39:40,959
consistency

1354
00:39:37,519 --> 00:39:43,039
it's if you're gonna grow a plant it's

1355
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:44,559
like growing anything else that's alive

1356
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:48,800
it requires daily

1357
00:39:44,559 --> 00:39:50,639
active work and if you forget about it

1358
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:52,000
or you don't put a lot of effort in up

1359
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:54,480
front so your

1360
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,559
your gear doesn't run right or doesn't

1361
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,760
work well together or doesn't fit in

1362
00:39:56,559 --> 00:40:00,960
your space or

1363
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:01,440
parts of it don't work you're gonna end

1364
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:04,559
up with

1365
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:06,159
[ __ ] and it's gonna cost you money if

1366
00:40:04,559 --> 00:40:07,920
you put a little prep work into it

1367
00:40:06,159 --> 00:40:09,440
and do your research and then put in

1368
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,079
your due diligence every day you're

1369
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:13,119
going to grow

1370
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:14,560
fire yes this is how it works

1371
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:16,000
if you did the proper research and put

1372
00:40:14,559 --> 00:40:17,279
genetics that were worth the [ __ ]

1373
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:21,440
outside or in your growth

1374
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:24,960
yes yeah yeah the plan i uh

1375
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:27,599
i can't believe they're still

1376
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:28,559
like there's there's so much information

1377
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:31,519
now when

1378
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:32,078
you and me first got into cannabis there

1379
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:38,079
were

1380
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:41,519
one or two grow books and they were like

1381
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:42,079
mythical yeah uh the the only reference

1382
00:40:41,519 --> 00:40:43,679
i can

1383
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:46,079
think of from pop culture is in the

1384
00:40:43,679 --> 00:40:48,318
first american pie there's the book of

1385
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:49,839
how to [ __ ] that they have to go get

1386
00:40:48,318 --> 00:40:51,279
from under the library shelf

1387
00:40:49,838 --> 00:40:53,199
it was like trying to find the anarchist

1388
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:57,440
cookbook yeah

1389
00:40:53,199 --> 00:40:57,439
yeah um but uh

1390
00:40:57,838 --> 00:41:01,358
you had to take sketchy advice and then

1391
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,119
the first

1392
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:04,880
internet forums like roll it up and

1393
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:07,200
whatnot you never knew

1394
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:08,720
if you were talking to someone who was

1395
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:10,639
trying to help you out

1396
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:12,159
if you were talking to a competitor who

1397
00:41:10,639 --> 00:41:14,719
was trying to get you to [ __ ] up

1398
00:41:12,159 --> 00:41:15,920
yourself so that you wouldn't um eat up

1399
00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:17,439
any market share

1400
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,760
or if you were talking to a cop who's

1401
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:23,519
trying to arrest you you have no idea

1402
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:24,880
yeah and so it was so much harder to

1403
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:27,039
find good advice

1404
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:28,640
but now it's so easy if you just do your

1405
00:41:27,039 --> 00:41:31,599
homework a little bit

1406
00:41:28,639 --> 00:41:34,400
you can get a good idea of which pieces

1407
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:37,039
of equipment you need how to set them up

1408
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:37,838
um what to feed your plants on what kind

1409
00:41:37,039 --> 00:41:39,358
of schedule

1410
00:41:37,838 --> 00:41:42,559
and you're going to be moderately

1411
00:41:39,358 --> 00:41:44,960
successful if you just put in the work

1412
00:41:42,559 --> 00:41:46,639
please put in the work yes so much bad

1413
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:49,039
herb

1414
00:41:46,639 --> 00:41:50,719
just get a book read a book like it's

1415
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:51,119
weird how many people like get plants

1416
00:41:50,719 --> 00:41:52,480
and then

1417
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:54,480
like day fourth like what should i have

1418
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:56,000

1421

you gotta go to driver's ed before you

1422
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:03,759
get in the car and stomp on the pedals

1423
00:42:02,239 --> 00:42:05,199
and then three guys in the chat give

1424
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:06,720
them like you should top that you need

1425
00:42:05,199 --> 00:42:08,000
to top that plant right now and like

1426
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:09,679
topping it's not going to do anything
