18
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:43,079

00:00:44,308 --> 00:00:48,839
Carabas just because ya start drinking

22
00:00:47,369 --> 00:00:50,609

down temporarily for all of this and

26
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:59,190
that's just is it because they don't

27
00:00:57,808 --> 00:01:00,390
have people to make the beer they gotta

28
00:00:59,189 --> 00:01:02,849
send the people home or is it just

29
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:07,469
nobody's buying the damn beer does sales

30
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:08,728

76

open this jar this was a 1 gram fat

77
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:55,509
diamond I'm going to put on a dabber and

78
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:58,060
show the camera yeah this company

79
00:02:55,509 --> 00:03:00,699
specializes in just straight-up mole

80
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:02,920
rocks THC a diamonds if you're watching

81
00:03:00,699 --> 00:03:05,049
this on the camera on the video that is

82
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:07,000
real that is a THC a diamond I've

83
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:08,439
already dabbed about half of its this is

84
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,439
half of what was left and it half of

85
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:13,389
what was in the container and it was a

86
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:14,949
gift an it was specially selected for me

87
00:03:13,389 --> 00:03:17,949
so it may have been bigger than a gram

88
00:03:14,949 --> 00:03:21,639
but that was a very beautiful diamond it

89
00:03:17,949 --> 00:03:24,129
is odorless and it is flavorless but it

90
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:26,349
is very potent when you dab it ah it

91
00:03:24,129 --> 00:03:28,629
makes your arm my arm hair stand up it

92
00:03:26,349 --> 00:03:30,099
made me get real talkative I got red my

93
00:03:28,629 --> 00:03:33,669
body temperature went up I took a

94
00:03:30,099 --> 00:03:34,209
[ __ ] big dab also ah it was I really

95
00:03:33,669 --> 00:03:36,429
liked it

96
00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:38,259
then the person who gave it to me

97
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:39,610
recommended she's like I know you you

98
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:40,989
probably have some turps sauce or

99
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:42,430
something I really like it when you mix

100
00:03:40,989 --> 00:03:43,930
it with a little bit of Terp sauce of

101
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:46,060
course you know me I've got some turps

102
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:48,250
sauce I've got this a little 10 gram jar

103
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:50,620
of lemon oh gee Terp sauce from our

104
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:52,810
friends at apothecary farms so I put a

105
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:55,360
little chunk of that concentrate on the

106
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:57,280
just on the table and then I dipped it

107
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,420
into a little bit of this sauce try to

108
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,550
get that on the camera there a little

109
00:03:58,419 --> 00:04:01,299
bit that's just liquid terpenes in the

110
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:03,100
lord

111
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:05,770
cannabis derived terpenes yeah that is a

112
00:04:03,099 --> 00:04:07,479
high Servius full-spectrum extract

113
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:09,489
that's probably 7 or 8 grams left in

114
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:11,469
that jar there but we put some of that

115
00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:14,680
on it and that was tremendous the high

116
00:04:11,469 --> 00:04:16,569
goes straight to the face just Kapow

117
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:19,358
instantly as soon as you daddy like oh

118
00:04:16,569 --> 00:04:21,990
whoa I might be in trouble and you get I

119
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:24,728
got real high for a minute um kind of

120
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:26,590
almost too talkative almost racy

121
00:04:24,728 --> 00:04:29,168
almost a paranoid sort of a thing

122
00:04:26,589 --> 00:04:31,000
but once it settles in I was loving it I

123
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:33,579
was super high like psychedelic high

124
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,620
like let's go do some [ __ ] good concert

125
00:04:33,579 --> 00:04:37,478

the show they didn't ask for anything

131
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:46,629
like that they threw me a grandma

132
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,620

00:04:56,918 --> 00:04:59,889
like I've been talking a long time about

140

to share with us what you're smoking

142
00:05:01,089 --> 00:05:05,459
today sure most of what I've been

143
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:11,439
smoking today is this Sour Diesel

144
00:05:05,459 --> 00:05:12,939
ambrosia nice bed up there is that

145
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:14,620
coming through folks there's not a lot

146
00:05:12,939 --> 00:05:15,790
of light down here it's kind of coming

147
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:17,889
throughout the video show though it's

148
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:22,560
pretty good to me I would dab that it's

149
00:05:17,889 --> 00:05:25,240
wonderful nice diamonds delicious sauce

150
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,530
it's it's doing his damn job I'll tell

151
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:30,759
you that much just gonna say you sound

152
00:05:26,529 --> 00:05:33,399
stoned not a lot of details just bash

153
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:35,709
worked yeah alright well Mike is smoking

154
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:38,288
Sour Diesel ambrosia from our friends at

155
00:05:35,709 --> 00:05:40,060
apothecary Farms um not to be a hater of

156
00:05:38,288 --> 00:05:42,490
your concentrate I am NOT a fan of Sour

157
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:44,620
Diesel concentrates but I love the Sour

158
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:46,930
Diesel flowers something about

159
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:49,360
extracting it doesn't bring that proper

160
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:52,569
essence in my opinion it loses something

161
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:55,569
for sure but I was missing the sour deed

162
00:05:52,569 --> 00:05:57,399
and that's what was available the buzz

163
00:05:55,569 --> 00:06:00,098
is still there so if you want that sour

164
00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:02,019

you're gonna get that but I don't think

167
00:06:03,459 --> 00:06:07,089

to do is visit www.payoor.com it easy

216
00:08:00,699 --> 00:08:06,039
also for the very first time I would

217
00:08:03,189 --> 00:08:07,959
like to introduce white Mike's patreon

218
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:17,910

several times he brings a lot of great

221
00:08:20,949 --> 00:08:25,120
and all his information several times

222
00:08:23,589 --> 00:08:26,709
J's I think he's been on a hundred

223
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,600
episodes we were talking earlier take

224
00:08:26,709 --> 00:08:30,310
yeah I'm gonna guess easily you're on a

225
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:32,080
quarter of the shows for a while you run

226
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:33,190
a long stretch I'm gonna say you've been

227
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,280
on hundred shows

228
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:38,560
Mike is very articulate he's well-spoken

229
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:39,909

00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:42,279
his thoughts and opinions his thought

231
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:44,740
process most of what he says really

232
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:46,059
makes sense to me it's okay that I had

233
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:47,500
disagree with you occasionally that's

234
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:50,079
why we're good friends but most of the

235
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:51,700
time he's [ __ ] spot-on so that's my

236
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,740

250
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:19,610
proud of you for making it this far yeah

251
00:09:18,139 --> 00:09:21,919
we've been on lockdown for a minute I

252
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:24,649
had to get inventive in patreon and some

253
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:26,299
video episodes I think it's gonna be no

254
00:09:24,649 --> 00:09:28,100
way to do it for a minute I think it'll

255
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:29,750
be great and it's a good way to make a

256
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:32,090
positive out of a negative but people

257
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:33,769
need some entertainment they want to get

258
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:35,570
their mind off of things and seeing our

259
00:09:33,769 --> 00:09:37,250
smiley or whatever you want to call it

260
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:39,560
our pasty faces here on the screen is a

261
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:40,669
good way for people to escape and also

262
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:43,009
learn something they're hanging out with

263
00:09:40,669 --> 00:09:44,149
us we could pass them a virtual [ __ ]

264
00:09:43,009 --> 00:09:46,549
joint like this they could grab it

265
00:09:44,149 --> 00:09:47,600
through the screen there you go and then

266
00:09:46,549 --> 00:09:49,549
they can hang out and they can learn

267
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,279
they can get educated and it's [ __ ]

268
00:09:49,549 --> 00:09:54,439
free so that is really cool yeah I'm

269
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:57,139
gonna I'm missing the flowers man I need

270
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:58,850
flowers down in my bunker but I've been

271
00:09:57,139 --> 00:10:02,029
keeping the flowers outside at this new

272
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:05,889
place oh man that's new hash only in the

273
00:10:02,029 --> 00:10:09,919
bunker how effective the no smoking oh

274
00:10:05,889 --> 00:10:11,899
okay all right um I'm this I don't know

275
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:14,719
if this is anybody else's getting this

276
00:10:11,899 --> 00:10:16,789
but I am very confused by the seasons

277
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,560
and the time of year right now I keep

278
00:10:16,789 --> 00:10:20,599
forgetting that it is spring and going

279
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:22,250
into summer I keep feeling like we just

280
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,590
got [ __ ] for a summer and we're going

281
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:26,509
into winter I've been shopping online

282
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:27,800
and most of my clothes are fall and

283
00:10:26,509 --> 00:10:29,990
winter appropriate that I've purchased

284
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:31,549
you tell yourself all the way to the end

285
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:32,389
of the year already know something about

286
00:10:31,549 --> 00:10:34,639
the lockdown

287
00:10:32,389 --> 00:10:36,470
I just I'm like well we got [ __ ] for

288
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:38,149
spring I didn't see the spring happen

289
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:39,950
like I normally do and it was cold and

290
00:10:38,149 --> 00:10:41,269
so I guess I'm used to it as being cold

291
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:42,470
and I thought it was going to continue

292
00:10:41,269 --> 00:10:44,389
to be cold or something I don't know my

293
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:46,160
brain was you went inside when it was

294
00:10:44,389 --> 00:10:49,370
cold out your body hasn't told you it's

295
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:51,110
summer yet yeah we haven't had that for

296
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:52,850
20 well we should have had a 4/20 party

297
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:54,320
we should add an Easter party we should

298
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:55,519
add a st. Patrick's Day party there

299
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,080
should have been so many things to tell

300
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,240
my mind and body that we've progressed

301
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:00,800
in the year instead it's been Groundhog

302
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:02,750
Day I'm just doing the same [ __ ]

303
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:06,409

306
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:11,629
Groundhog Day thing that's [ __ ] rude

307
00:11:09,409 --> 00:11:14,089
legit during the lockdown it is weird

308
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:16,250
um every day the same hopefully people

309
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:19,129
are listening to this what would be the

310
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:20,899
future from now so I don't try to dwell

311
00:11:19,129 --> 00:11:23,860
too much on the kovat 19 thing but just

312

a few people because there are a few

324
00:11:58,549 --> 00:12:02,149
things that were almost necessary

325
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:03,560
interactions like like things that just

326
00:12:02,149 --> 00:12:05,389
have to happen I've gone to the grocery

327
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:07,939
store I've gone to the dispensary I've

328
00:12:05,389 --> 00:12:11,029
seen you once or twice there were brief

329
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:12,320
interactions but I know she talked too

330
00:12:11,029 --> 00:12:14,509
much about that but they had to happen

331
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,860
we had to get equipment how are you

332
00:12:14,509 --> 00:12:17,539
gonna record it you didn't get equipment

333
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:20,210

334
00:12:17,539 --> 00:12:22,429
to me that was already mailed to you

335
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:24,320
yeah I mean there was no way to teach

336
00:12:22,429 --> 00:12:26,779
you it was like to have to see him to

337
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,940

338

384
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:06,330
really pay attention to how long we've

here on a video show I think that this

388
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:15,909
would be a good opportunity to kind of

389
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:17,200
do the official white Mike interview

390
00:14:15,909 --> 00:14:19,329

vol 1 we may do this in the future I'd

419
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:17,379
like to start it off by talking about

420
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:20,080
how and where I met my buddy white Mike

421
00:15:17,379 --> 00:15:22,360
I was honoured and privileged to be a

422
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:23,920
part of the very first dispensary here

423
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,960
in Pueblo Colorado it was called met

424
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:27,399
amar it's called met amar ministries we

425
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,960
were kind of flying under a radar by

426
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:31,179
putting the word ministries on there and

427
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:32,860
it worked but we were met in more

428
00:15:31,179 --> 00:15:34,779
ministries we were ran by a guy named

429
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:36,100
Tom and his beautiful wife Karen rest

430
00:15:34,779 --> 00:15:37,480
pease Karen I love you and I miss you I

431
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:39,070
wish I could pass you joint right now

432
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,899
there were a couple of other folks

433
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:43,600
involved in that dispensary we got to

434
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:46,419
mention Chris an and tree uh several

435
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:49,240
other folks but I was mainly the dude

436
00:15:46,419 --> 00:15:50,740
running the show I found a dispensary

437
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:52,210
that was kind of operating in an

438
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:53,950
apartment and I was like how about we

439
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:54,910
open an office and do this for real and

440
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:56,860
they're like if you're brave enough to

441
00:15:54,909 --> 00:15:58,269
go set up a counter and do this we'll do

442
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:59,830
it and I was like we're doing it kind of

443
00:15:58,269 --> 00:16:00,850
sketchy let's just [ __ ] do it for

444
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:02,080
real if we're gonna do it we're gonna

445
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:06,790
get in trouble up here or down here

446
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:09,639
what's doing this was in what 2009 I

447
00:16:06,789 --> 00:16:12,069
think 2008 is when we got it going when

448
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:13,569
I started doing it a winter of 2008 is

449
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:15,460
when I met the guy in the apartment

450
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:18,010
I believe cuz I got my medical card

451
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:20,230
around before Christmas around

452
00:16:18,009 --> 00:16:21,519
Thanksgiving that year I believe if I've

453
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:23,649
got a brain injury Mike so you gotta

454
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:25,449
give me some credit on my timelines that

455
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:28,449
timeline sounds about right she does got

456
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:30,550
an A - mm early 2000 yeah so I think

457
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:34,120
winter of 2008 is when I met the guy in

458
00:16:30,549 --> 00:16:36,669
the apartment by early 2009 we had moved

459
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,960
it downstairs to the retail place and we

460
00:16:36,669 --> 00:16:41,349
had opened up like a full on retail

461
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:43,720
dispensary I was working 6 days a week

462
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:45,070
from open to closed in the dispensary no

463
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:47,080
I'm not bragging I'm not complaining

464
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:47,830
that was my position it was awesome no

465
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,360
problem with that

466
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:50,680
I would [ __ ] and that was a great time I

467
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,649
learned so much I had so much

468
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:56,979
interaction I got so much calm at this

469
00:16:53,649 --> 00:16:58,569
time in at least in Colorado selling

470
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:01,149
weed over the counter was a little bit

471
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:03,640
like being a Space Ranger it was awesome

472
00:17:01,149 --> 00:17:07,029
I was people thought I was a superhero

473
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:09,220
it was snacks and food and lunch and

474
00:17:07,029 --> 00:17:12,549
stickers and gifts all the time and also

475
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:13,930
the owners this was the thing yeah if if

476
00:17:12,549 --> 00:17:16,750
you couldn't decide if you wanted to buy

477
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:18,549
jar a or jar B I'd pack up a bowl a jar

478
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:20,140
a and a bowl a jar beer we [ __ ] smoke

479
00:17:18,549 --> 00:17:21,849
him see which one you like better than

480
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:23,320
he could make your decision like it was

481
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:25,299
real weed smoke him right there in the

482
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:28,119

486
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:38,349
another person um his father-in-law not

487
00:17:36,609 --> 00:17:40,149
sure how much detail I should convey

488
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:41,949
here but Mike came in with his

489
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:43,030

old guy came in several times without my

493
00:17:46,869 --> 00:17:51,979
and then he came in a few times with my

494
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:54,009
and Mike and I just made friends then

495

496
00:17:54,009 --> 00:17:58,819

00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:21,019
hesitation and you laughed and we were

507
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:22,190
we I was like being this guy our friends

508
00:18:21,019 --> 00:18:23,839
I'd already liked you from coming into

509
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:25,400
the dispensary you speak well you're

510
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:27,649
articulate you're [ __ ] smart we're

511
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:29,060
the similar lines of music we like to

512
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:31,340
argue about the music but deep down our

513
00:18:29,059 --> 00:18:33,649
roots are the [ __ ] same all right and

514
00:18:31,339 --> 00:18:36,259
we're just like the herb we both loved

515
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:38,330
ganja yeah and we wanted to put ganja in

516
00:18:36,259 --> 00:18:40,700
a positive light so we became friends I

517
00:18:38,329 --> 00:18:42,439
got the opportunity I was the manager at

518
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:44,900
that dispensary I got the opportunity by

519
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:47,090
the owner to hire another budtender and

520
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:48,980
an assistant manager Mike was honestly

521
00:18:47,089 --> 00:18:50,480
the first person to come to my mind

522
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:53,029
he's well-spoken he's a smart guy I

523
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,769
trust him he knew about cannabis so I

524
00:18:53,029 --> 00:18:56,180
was like I know this guy Mike let's

525
00:18:54,769 --> 00:18:57,559
[ __ ] give him a shot I interviewed

526
00:18:56,180 --> 00:19:01,850
him I think they probably hired you on

527
00:18:57,559 --> 00:19:04,159
the spot knowing Tom yeah yeah so this

528
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:05,389
is one of the stranger days my I was

529
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,769
like do you want to work here and I was

530
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:08,450
like yes tell me a little bit about

531
00:19:06,769 --> 00:19:11,240
yourself I gave him like a little five

532
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:13,519
minute here's what's up with me he was

533
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:15,259
like cool I guess could do this for me

534
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:17,359
and then he laughed and I went to work

535
00:19:15,259 --> 00:19:19,160
yeah that's basically that place didn't

536
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:22,309
have a lot of order it didn't have a

537
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:24,500
paperwork no he was Brahma he was from

538
00:19:22,309 --> 00:19:26,899
North Carolina and he was an older guy

539
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:29,059
and he had the exact attitude you think

540
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:30,769
an older weed grower from North Carolina

541
00:19:29,059 --> 00:19:32,779
would have as long as the weed grew

542
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:34,759
landed on the Shelf turned into money we

543
00:19:32,779 --> 00:19:35,450
got paychecks I think everything else is

544
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:37,129
gonna be all right

545
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:39,950
yeah that's he didn't give too much of a

546
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:43,040
[ __ ] so eventually unfortunately that

547
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:44,600
dispensary was closed by our city I saw

548
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:46,759
it coming we knew was gonna happen [ __ ]

549
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:48,379
was evolving city came in politely

550
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:49,700
closed us they could have done it much

551
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:52,340
more aggressively we could have all been

552
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:53,960
arrested yeah they came in and said hey

553
00:19:52,339 --> 00:19:55,369
please quit and we were given the

554
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,960
opportunity to close the doors

555
00:19:55,369 --> 00:19:58,789
our smartass answer was what about all

556
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,710
the people in line they were kind enough

557
00:19:58,789 --> 00:20:01,879
to let us serve the people in live when

558
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:03,289
they came in a few

559
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:05,900
people got up and booked as soon as they

560
00:20:03,289 --> 00:20:07,220
saw a cop come in they were gone but a

561
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,750
few people were like I've got a medical

562
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:10,970
marijuana card they can't [ __ ] with me I

563
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:13,789
know the rules those people that stayed

564
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:15,350
I gave them most of the product we had

565
00:20:13,789 --> 00:20:16,549
on hand I split all of the remaining

566
00:20:15,349 --> 00:20:18,740
products with the permission of the

567
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:20,509
owner and the manager I split all of the

568
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:22,400
product up amongst the last customers

569
00:20:20,509 --> 00:20:24,140
and the last employees in the building I

570
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,880
was like it's our last day here here's

571
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:28,460
all of our bonus checks we can't sell it

572
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:30,790
let's have a good time so there's been

573
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:33,559
three points yeah

574
00:20:30,789 --> 00:20:35,690
drunk edibles that did yeah did we all

575
00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:36,710
load it load it up and it was all legit

576
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:38,080
you guys we didn't steal anything the

577
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:42,350
owner was standing there next to us so

578
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:43,699
um at that point Mike kind of became my

579
00:20:42,349 --> 00:20:45,199
helper he was already one of my best

580
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,370

581
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,170

I could count on Mike being there

591

he was my girl helper he could build

592

white Mike um it's a joke I made it as a

613
00:21:50,839 --> 00:21:56,419
joke because uh it's just such a white

614

guy dude he's from parkour he wears a

615
00:21:56,420 --> 00:22:01,519
Jen cause he listens to [ __ ] 311 and

616
00:21:58,579 --> 00:22:03,470
if I have weed in the car and I go fast

617
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:06,529
he says buddy decide if you want to have

618
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:07,759
weed or go fast one lot break one lot of

619
00:22:06,529 --> 00:22:08,539
time look if you're gonna break a loved

620
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:10,759
one at a time

621
00:22:08,539 --> 00:22:13,309
let's see those are the reasons that

622
00:22:10,759 --> 00:22:15,650
make you white Mike like and I have no

623
00:22:13,309 --> 00:22:17,269
problem with it I love it every guy I'm

624
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:19,430
kind of a rebel I'm kind of a loose

625
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:22,849
cannon I forget sometimes that I'm

626
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:23,390
smoking a joint driving 90 talking on my

627
00:22:22,849 --> 00:22:24,649
phone

628
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:27,620
but all of this should I shouldn't be

629
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:29,269
doing it Michael go slow down put the

630
00:22:27,619 --> 00:22:30,679
phone away or put the joint out we can't

631
00:22:29,269 --> 00:22:32,420
do all of this buddy and I'm like oh

632
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:34,250
thank you Mike I'm really glad you're in

633
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:35,750
the passenger seat because sometimes I

634
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:37,670
get a little [ __ ] carried away

635
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:39,140
so Mike became white Mike for that

636
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:41,060
reason if it bothers you that I call him

637
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:42,980
white Mike is all in love it's all in

638
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:44,269
good fun look how [ __ ] pasty he is we

639
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:47,000
got him on a video here you could see

640
00:22:44,269 --> 00:22:48,920
his right mr. pasty uh he's from

641
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:52,160
Colorado he says bro he's wearing a

642
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:54,019
beanie he's goes on yeah he's qualified

643
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:55,640
is white Mike it's nothing racist I

644
00:22:54,019 --> 00:22:57,829
think it's all in good fun so that's

645
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:59,840
where white Mike the nickname white Mike

646
00:22:57,829 --> 00:23:01,460
came from I gave that one to him because

647
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:03,589
if I needed somebody to research

648
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:06,019
something tell me about a law fill out

649
00:23:03,589 --> 00:23:08,359
some paperwork some white guy [ __ ] Mike

650
00:23:06,019 --> 00:23:11,779
would do it for me I'll do that [ __ ]

651
00:23:08,359 --> 00:23:12,889
that's my gig so that is a little excuse

652
00:23:11,779 --> 00:23:15,289
throat clearing guys I'm gonna blame

653
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:17,480
that on our friends at first matter

654
00:23:15,289 --> 00:23:19,309
Premium concentrates shout out for the

655
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:20,599
fatty dabs so I'm crossing off all the

656
00:23:19,309 --> 00:23:21,769
[ __ ] that I've covered here because we

657
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:23,719
do have an extensive interview I'm

658
00:23:21,769 --> 00:23:25,369
trying to be a good interviewer uh Mike

659
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:28,100
we've covered up to the point where I

660
00:23:25,369 --> 00:23:29,779
met you and you became my bud tender and

661
00:23:28,099 --> 00:23:31,939
my bro and there's a little interest

662
00:23:29,779 --> 00:23:33,319
that's our origin story also I got a

663
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:36,519
mention that in that same time period

664
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:38,960
Mike got me involved in the cannabis

665
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:39,980
community going to City Council meetings

666
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,420
that's what I'm trying to say City

667
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:42,740
Council I would have never gone to City

668
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,630
Council meetings I would not have gotten

669
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:46,789
put a politically active that would not

670
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:48,800
be part of my repertoire if it weren't

671
00:23:46,789 --> 00:23:50,720
for Mike so I feel like that's where

672
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:53,539
Mike shines is on the paperwork

673
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:56,329
the activism the well-spoken side I do

674
00:23:53,539 --> 00:23:58,129
this jamriang [ __ ] bro talk and I do

675
00:23:56,329 --> 00:24:00,289
the grow in the cultivation I'd be the

676
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:03,470
cartoon character Mike does the white

677
00:24:00,289 --> 00:24:05,899
guy [ __ ] so um he introduced me to the

678
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:08,120
City Council part and kind of taught me

679
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:09,769
how to tighten up my game a little bit

680
00:24:08,119 --> 00:24:12,500
so that's where Mike came in in my world

681
00:24:09,769 --> 00:24:14,029
hmm sorry about that that was gross now

682
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:16,940
where I want to jump to is can you tell

683
00:24:14,029 --> 00:24:18,649
us what you were doing before you got

684
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:20,029
into the cannabis game you don't have to

685
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:21,140
reveal too much there's not comfortable

686
00:24:20,029 --> 00:24:24,289
with what were you doing before the week

687
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:25,460
game bro how far back should I go as far

688
00:24:24,289 --> 00:24:27,079
as you're comfortable man let's do the

689
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:28,279
day you were born what were you thinking

690
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:29,359
when he looked up and saw the bright

691
00:24:28,279 --> 00:24:31,849
lights I'm just kidding

692
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:35,409
yeah what Mike was born alone maybe

693
00:24:31,849 --> 00:24:35,409
let's start it what got you smoking weed

694
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:43,340
what got me smoking weed yeah where did

695
00:24:39,829 --> 00:24:45,259
you go wee man I just remember every

696
00:24:43,339 --> 00:24:49,129
everybody was obsessed with it in school

697
00:24:45,259 --> 00:24:53,930
like I grew up in Jeff mentioned at

698
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:56,690
Parker Colorado in 80s and 90s the

699
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:58,279
parents movement at the time the

700
00:24:56,690 --> 00:25:00,470
anti-drug parents movement was a big

701
00:24:58,279 --> 00:25:02,599
thing drugs and schools were a big thing

702
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:04,579
gangs and schools were a big thing I

703
00:25:02,599 --> 00:25:06,529
mean none of this [ __ ] really existed in

704
00:25:04,579 --> 00:25:10,250
Parker but they were [ __ ] super

705
00:25:06,529 --> 00:25:12,379
paranoid about it and so there's a

706
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:14,779
little suburb outside of Denver just a

707
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:17,780
few miles outside of Denver it's really

708
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:19,970
suburb II it's real nice Douglas County

709
00:25:17,779 --> 00:25:21,920
Colorado for most of my childhood it was

710
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:25,009
the fastest growing County in the United

711
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:26,450
States that's pretty cool why I liked it

712
00:25:25,009 --> 00:25:28,250
I like to joke that we didn't have white

713
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:30,140
people in my town when we didn't have

714
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:32,089
non-white people in my town when I was

715
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:33,380
growing up that's why the cops [ __ ]

716
00:25:32,089 --> 00:25:35,779
with the teenagers so much because there

717
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:38,000
were no minorities to screw with it's

718
00:25:35,779 --> 00:25:40,579
actually true and it's weirdly trooper

719
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,839
true about Parker like I remember in

720
00:25:40,579 --> 00:25:43,519
middle school we used to make the one

721
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:45,799
black girl stand up and talk about what

722
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:48,109
it was like to be black in February and

723
00:25:45,799 --> 00:25:49,519
the one Jewish kid get up in December

724
00:25:48,109 --> 00:25:51,169
and talk about what it was like not to

725
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:52,879
have a Christmas tree I think it was

726
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:55,490
really [ __ ] up the 80s were a weird

727
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,540
time if you're a lot younger than Jeff

728
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:58,640
and this sounds insane

729
00:25:56,539 --> 00:26:02,750
it's just what we did to people back

730
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:04,550
then but all the way through school they

731
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:06,019
kept bringing it up marijuana people are

732
00:26:04,549 --> 00:26:07,519
gonna offer you marijuana every time I

733
00:26:06,019 --> 00:26:09,740
went to Denver with my parents I was

734
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:10,759
like where the drug dealers at like why

735
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:12,259
aren't they trying to sell me drugs

736
00:26:10,759 --> 00:26:14,000
would give me free drugs you get me

737
00:26:12,259 --> 00:26:15,140
hooked on drugs I'm confused

738
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,019
they're lying to me in school or

739
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:20,690
something it's waiting for those guys

740
00:26:17,019 --> 00:26:23,650
and then I was sitting in the hall it's

741
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:27,080
school working on a group project and

742
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:29,210
this kid that lived up the street from

743
00:26:27,079 --> 00:26:32,149
me comes whipping around the corner of

744
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:34,340
the hallway like power walking and as he

745
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:35,690
came around the corner he pulled his

746
00:26:34,339 --> 00:26:37,789
hand out of his pocket and threw

747
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:39,440
something at me and it hit me into my

748
00:26:37,789 --> 00:26:41,659
chest and I didn't know what the [ __ ]

749
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,840
was happening but I had the presence of

750
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:46,019
mind to flip my shirt

751
00:26:42,839 --> 00:26:47,339
or whatever just hit me and two teachers

752
00:26:46,019 --> 00:26:50,069
came running around the corner right

753
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:52,529
behind him and were like hey not so fast

754
00:26:50,069 --> 00:26:53,909
like stay where we can see you and we're

755
00:26:52,529 --> 00:26:56,279
kind of like marching him off to the

756
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:57,930
office or something and after they

757
00:26:56,279 --> 00:26:59,129
passed I looked down and the two kids

758
00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:00,570
that were working on the project myth

759

805
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,210

challenging all right so we got you

808
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:51,319
smoking about [ __ ] 15 years old you

809
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:52,579
smoked all the way through high school

810
00:28:51,319 --> 00:28:57,240
yeah

811
00:28:52,579 --> 00:28:59,490
from the time I was 15 through now all

812
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:01,409
right so college all that good [ __ ] all

813
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:02,700
right that puts me back to where were

814
00:29:01,409 --> 00:29:03,870
you right before the industry what kind

815
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:07,639
of I know you're well educated so we

816
00:29:03,869 --> 00:29:10,408
kind of education you guys what sex we

817
00:29:07,638 --> 00:29:12,119
in college I studied sociology in

818
00:29:10,409 --> 00:29:15,960
psychology so I took a lot of drugs

819
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:20,569
classes drugs in society type stuff drug

820
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:20,569
policy type stuff history a drug policy

821
00:29:21,319 --> 00:29:25,740
one of the things that blew my mind one

822
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:27,599
of the first drugs classes I took the

823
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:29,759
class started the history of drugs with

824
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:31,079
salt and pepper like that's where it

825
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:34,169
started out and if you look at the

826
00:29:31,079 --> 00:29:35,819
history of the spice trade it's exactly

827
00:29:34,169 --> 00:29:39,259
like the modern marijuana market like

828
00:29:35,819 --> 00:29:42,298
it's fun makes total sense to mom but

829
00:29:39,259 --> 00:29:45,450
when I graduated college the goal is to

830
00:29:42,298 --> 00:29:46,980
go work with at-risk youth I wanted to

831
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:49,169
go help teenagers that kind of had a

832
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:51,509
shitty run of it get their feet back

833
00:29:49,169 --> 00:29:54,059
under him so they didn't turn into

834
00:29:51,509 --> 00:29:56,700
shitty adults and I went and worked with

835
00:29:54,058 --> 00:30:00,359
locked up teens for a couple years and

836
00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:02,220
got injured and as I was trying to

837
00:30:00,359 --> 00:30:05,908
figure out what I was gonna do after

838
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:08,009
that a friend of mine came down with

839
00:30:05,909 --> 00:30:13,830
what eventually we learned was a mess

840
00:30:08,009 --> 00:30:15,929
and we just sort of trial and error he

841
00:30:13,829 --> 00:30:18,388
uh he was miserable he had to do like

842
00:30:15,929 --> 00:30:20,038
four weeks straight the hospital where

843
00:30:18,388 --> 00:30:24,178
they did tests after tests and blood

844
00:30:20,038 --> 00:30:27,509
draw after blood draw and he was living

845
00:30:24,179 --> 00:30:29,250
with me at the time and I I called him

846
00:30:27,509 --> 00:30:30,538
today was before I went to go pick him

847
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:31,740
up in the hospital and I was like dude

848
00:30:30,538 --> 00:30:33,868
what do you want free cut your

849
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:35,970
homecoming and he was like I'm [ __ ]

850
00:30:33,868 --> 00:30:37,168
miserable I just want to be home I want

851
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:37,569
to take a shower and he's like I want to

852
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:40,810
get

853
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:44,079
like clean the bong and have some good

854
00:30:40,809 --> 00:30:48,149
weed waiting for me and this was 2004

855
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:52,629
maybe 2005 at the latest

856
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:54,400
okay so Colorado went medical in 2000

857
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:57,880
but nothing existed yet there was no

858
00:30:54,400 --> 00:31:00,910
dispensaries there was two or three or

859
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:04,630
four doctors across the state signing

860
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:06,160
paperwork time but it existed but it was

861
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:09,360
real quiet nobody talked about it nobody

862
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:12,279
knew where to really get it yeah

863
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:17,049
and so my buddy comes home from the

864
00:31:12,279 --> 00:31:19,660
hospital and he's 24 and he needs a

865
00:31:17,049 --> 00:31:23,829
walker to walk to get around not a cane

866
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:26,019
but like the foreleg metal half box

867
00:31:23,829 --> 00:31:28,000
warrior yeah you weren't injured at work

868
00:31:26,019 --> 00:31:30,910
too so were you hurt at the same time or

869
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,160
my neck was messed up and it was giving

870
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:35,920
me weird pain signals down my left arm

871
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:38,890
okay and so my left hand kind of always

872
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:42,370
hurt and I was always massaging you

873
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:46,240
still do that yeah it's I slit my next

874
00:31:42,369 --> 00:31:49,149
not fixed and when I haven't been

875
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:51,250
keeping up with my CBD THC regimen and

876
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:53,350
the stretches that I do and the

877
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:56,349
inflammation builds up the pain comes

878
00:31:53,349 --> 00:31:57,849
right back oh I see you and word we're

879
00:31:56,349 --> 00:31:59,169
hanging out when you get the fidgets you

880
00:31:57,849 --> 00:32:00,399
start pulling on your thumbs and

881
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:02,050
stretching your hands out I see you go

882
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:04,660
right for it when after a couple dabs

883
00:32:02,049 --> 00:32:07,569
you start scratching I'm sorry I

884
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:10,420
couldn't that off so Mike needs a walker

885
00:32:07,569 --> 00:32:16,960
Dave comes home and he's got to use a

886
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:19,960
walker to get around and we get stoned

887
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:25,390
that night and I mean it was rough he

888
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:27,759
was having trouble talking he he'd think

889
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:30,130
this think of a sentence like I went to

890
00:32:27,759 --> 00:32:31,660
the store and bought cheese and he'd go

891
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:34,330
to say it and his brain would just pause

892
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:36,100
and it wouldn't want to say store and so

893
00:32:34,329 --> 00:32:37,119
he'd go I went to the any kind of look

894
00:32:36,099 --> 00:32:39,399
at you for a minute

895
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:40,750
and have to look down and the place

896
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:42,040
where you buy things and it's like the

897
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:43,930
store and he's like yeah if I can went

898
00:32:42,039 --> 00:32:45,700
to the store and I bought cheese it was

899
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:49,480
just brutal seeing my buddy kind of

900
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:51,940
pulled back like that because he is like

901
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:54,640
picking up girls in the military and

902
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:56,769
athletic and in fast cars and [ __ ] like

903
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,240
that and all of a sudden now he's a

904
00:32:56,769 --> 00:33:00,339
walker and he's struggling to talk and

905
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:06,750
struggling to talk it was rough to see

906
00:33:00,339 --> 00:33:09,279
and he takes a couple of bong hits and

907
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:12,519
stands up to go to the bathroom and just

908
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:14,678
walks to the bathroom and he didn't

909
00:33:12,519 --> 00:33:16,539
fetch it either until he opened the door

910
00:33:14,679 --> 00:33:19,059
and he saw his walk or sitting next to

911
00:33:16,539 --> 00:33:21,308
the chair and he looked at his feet was

912
00:33:19,058 --> 00:33:23,139
like what the [ __ ] he's the first time

913
00:33:21,308 --> 00:33:25,599
in six weeks that I've been able to walk

914
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:27,669
ten feet without tripping over my own

915
00:33:25,599 --> 00:33:30,639
feet and falling down without my Walker

916
00:33:27,669 --> 00:33:33,880
that is [ __ ] horrible and he sits

917
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:36,250
down and he goes did you notice that I

918
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:37,960
didn't need my walker and I go did you

919
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:41,919
notice she didn't stumble over that

920
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:43,298
sentence and we both just sort of stared

921
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:47,770
at each other for a minute going dude

922
00:33:43,298 --> 00:33:49,990
dude look with more bong hits we need to

923
00:33:47,769 --> 00:33:52,418
test this and after like three or four

924
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:54,609
days it was crystal clear that cannabis

925
00:33:52,419 --> 00:33:58,150
was medically beneficial for him that's

926
00:33:54,609 --> 00:34:01,029
awesome to put it mildly and then became

927
00:33:58,150 --> 00:34:03,820
we began like a year-long journey of

928
00:34:01,029 --> 00:34:06,369
getting him a medical marijuana card

929
00:34:03,819 --> 00:34:08,019
right because I said earlier you know

930
00:34:06,369 --> 00:34:11,500
dr. Ochs yes

931
00:34:08,019 --> 00:34:12,940
you couldn't just google pot doc there

932
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:16,269
was no weed maps there were no

933
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:18,579
dispensaries there were no Sanjay Gupta

934
00:34:16,269 --> 00:34:20,409
specials nothing you had to file

935
00:34:18,579 --> 00:34:22,389
something to know what is this card on

936
00:34:20,409 --> 00:34:23,530
your you are something weird like that

937
00:34:22,389 --> 00:34:27,269
there were weird ways of finding

938
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:33,159
dispensaries back in the day yeah I

939
00:34:27,269 --> 00:34:36,878
spent I've cut probably 50 hours digging

940
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:42,039
through forums and I found some doctors

941
00:34:36,878 --> 00:34:44,289
name and a couple of lawyers names and I

942
00:34:42,039 --> 00:34:46,239
was able to get him an appointment and

943
00:34:44,289 --> 00:34:48,190
back then it was a couple hundred

944
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:50,579
dollars for the appointment it was a

945
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:55,168
couple hundred dollars for the card and

946
00:34:50,579 --> 00:34:59,049
once you got the card all it meant was

947
00:34:55,168 --> 00:35:01,659
after the cop arrests you and you end up

948
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:03,269
in front of a judge you've got some

949
00:35:01,659 --> 00:35:05,190
paperwork to help try to

950
00:35:03,269 --> 00:35:07,889
you out of trouble because all it meant

951
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:11,519
then but I was able to get him that far

952
00:35:07,889 --> 00:35:15,420
and you could job store there was no

953
00:35:11,519 --> 00:35:17,099
stores right nothing existed then if it

954
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:19,980
was just you got caught with purely

955
00:35:17,099 --> 00:35:22,199
black-market herb you were allowed to

956
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:26,639
have it I'm you could grow your six

957
00:35:22,199 --> 00:35:28,500
plants and a story there were no rules

958
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:30,449
back then none whatsoever

959
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:34,679
other than the original framework of

960
00:35:30,449 --> 00:35:36,179
amendment 20 took minutes remember a

961
00:35:34,679 --> 00:35:39,929
minute one yeah I saw you searching for

962
00:35:36,179 --> 00:35:43,399
us let's say 64 20 so is it took us

963
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:48,809
about a year to get Dave his card and

964
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:50,519
about the same time my now wife then

965
00:35:48,809 --> 00:35:52,500

968
00:35:54,780 --> 00:36:02,880
her dad is sick and [ __ ] it always has

969
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:06,570

973
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:16,920
away since he was in his 20s and I said

974
00:36:15,269 --> 00:36:18,690

a process of getting him a card cool and

978
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:28,200

979
00:36:24,659 --> 00:36:29,940
and by the time I got him a card I had

980
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:30,929
found two or three more people that

981
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:33,450

982
00:36:30,929 --> 00:36:36,690

1071
00:40:16,769 --> 00:40:20,519
like we don't carry that here like we

1072

00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:32,490
Colorado and we have to remind ourselves

1076
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:34,440
that [ __ ] sometimes like Steve comes

1077
00:40:32,489 --> 00:40:36,389
home with there's a weed store downtown

1078
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:39,300
you got have you're never gonna believe

1079
00:40:36,389 --> 00:40:40,440
the car we got to go this is how [ __ ]

1080
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:42,180
you're going now you're never gonna

1081
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:43,950
believe this like you got to go before

1082
00:40:42,179 --> 00:40:46,639
the cops show up you got to see the [ __ ]

1083
00:40:43,949 --> 00:40:46,639
in action and

1084
00:40:47,829 --> 00:40:52,179
I was blown away that the quality was

1085
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:56,230
just as good as anything I'd been by and

1086
00:40:52,179 --> 00:40:57,940
if not better anywhere else thank you

1087
00:40:56,230 --> 00:41:01,570
because I was growing a lot of that that

1088
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:05,590
means a lot to me but I think the price

1089
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:07,450
was also a little bit better and you

1090
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:09,519
know we got death threats and all kinds

1091
00:41:07,449 --> 00:41:11,439
of problems because the combo said

1092
00:41:09,519 --> 00:41:13,929
that's that price here in this area

1093
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:15,159
people were angry bro like we were

1094
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:17,289
worried for a minute we're like we may

1095
00:41:15,159 --> 00:41:19,929
have [ __ ] up people get to experience

1096
00:41:17,289 --> 00:41:24,309
this in every state that goes legal but

1097
00:41:19,929 --> 00:41:27,069
the the the price on the black market is

1098
00:41:24,309 --> 00:41:29,289
fixed and that's a beautiful part of the

1099
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:31,840
market because everybody gets to pretend

1100
00:41:29,289 --> 00:41:34,360
that product is scarce to the point

1101
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:39,250
where the price is the price or [ __ ] off

1102
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:43,329
and as soon as there were stores where a

1103
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:45,369
customer could you know without a lot of

1104
00:41:43,329 --> 00:41:48,219
bravado go all right then I'll just go

1105
00:41:45,369 --> 00:41:49,480
to the other one like if home people

1106
00:41:48,219 --> 00:41:52,379
don't want to treat me good I'll go to

1107
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:54,789
Lowe's yep as soon as that's the thing

1108
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:58,840
the pricing at the price cause [ __ ]

1109
00:41:54,789 --> 00:42:03,279
scarce no more and by the time met amar

1110
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:06,640
had opened up there was a dispensary or

1111
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:09,640
two in Springs and then one or two in

1112
00:42:06,639 --> 00:42:11,079
Denver in two or three around the Front

1113
00:42:09,639 --> 00:42:15,849
Range and then one up at Fort Collins

1114
00:42:11,079 --> 00:42:20,349
and by the time we had real competition

1115
00:42:15,849 --> 00:42:21,940
down here the price had dropped to what

1116
00:42:20,349 --> 00:42:26,349
300 an ounce or something out good

1117
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:28,059
hundred dollars well 280 or 320 yeah man

1118
00:42:26,349 --> 00:42:31,539
our store loved the $400 an ounce

1119
00:42:28,059 --> 00:42:34,480
standard black market price at the time

1120
00:42:31,539 --> 00:42:36,070
and I mean by then the game had changed

1121
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:38,380
and that number sounds crazy high now

1122
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:41,200
when I said it yep yeah but it used to

1123
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:42,579
be 280 if you were a member or 320 if

1124
00:42:41,199 --> 00:42:43,869
you weren't and that was that's a whole

1125
00:42:42,579 --> 00:42:47,829
another topic we'll talk about in

1126
00:42:43,869 --> 00:42:50,679
another day when I was making the bottle

1127
00:42:47,829 --> 00:42:54,340
just now I was remembering the grows

1128
00:42:50,679 --> 00:42:57,730
back then there'd be a binder where had

1129
00:42:54,340 --> 00:43:00,640
like comic book plastic sheets in it

1130
00:42:57,730 --> 00:43:01,750
yeah and it was people photocopies a

1131
00:43:00,639 --> 00:43:04,179
full page

1132
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:06,820
the full medical marijuana application

1133
00:43:04,179 --> 00:43:08,589
yeah have your application your card

1134

1135
00:43:08,590 --> 00:43:13,210
go wrong look we've got their picture

1136
00:43:10,358 --> 00:43:15,579
their doctor recommendations and rose

1137
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:17,170
when law enforcement showed up and you

1138
00:43:15,579 --> 00:43:19,869
had to be like all right officer like

1139
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:21,880
please don't shoot yep like let's go

1140
00:43:19,869 --> 00:43:23,740
through a notebook

1141
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:25,269
we were trimming somewhere and law

1142
00:43:23,739 --> 00:43:26,529
enforcement showed up and all we did we

1143
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:28,000
all pulled out on Medical Marijuana

1144
00:43:26,530 --> 00:43:29,619
cards and they go it looks good too and

1145
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,260
they all left they didn't care it all

1146
00:43:29,619 --> 00:43:34,450
had a card you know I'm gonna take this

1147
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:37,570
dad you got to cover me for a moment um

1148
00:43:34,449 --> 00:43:40,719
but that was like two thousand six seven

1149
00:43:37,570 --> 00:43:46,180
eight ish and then when the city shop

1150
00:43:40,719 --> 00:43:50,439
met him are down my wife is a lawyer and

1151
00:43:46,179 --> 00:43:53,169
my family is in law so when the city

1152
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:56,108
shut us down saying we were violating

1153
00:43:53,170 --> 00:44:00,820
zoning rules that the City Council

1154
00:43:56,108 --> 00:44:03,159
hadn't passed yet I got pissed and I

1155
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:07,960
told the owner of met amar we've got to

1156
00:44:03,159 --> 00:44:09,250
fight this and for various reasons we

1157
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:12,130
said I'm not in the mood to fight right

1158
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:14,920
now so no so I decided [ __ ] it I'm gonna

1159
00:44:12,130 --> 00:44:16,858
go fight this myself and if they're

1160
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:19,838
gonna pass crazy rules like this

1161
00:44:16,858 --> 00:44:22,569
somebody from RN needs to stand up and

1162
00:44:19,838 --> 00:44:26,829
at least have our voice heard because at

1163
00:44:22,570 --> 00:44:31,289
that point it was very much City Council

1164
00:44:26,829 --> 00:44:33,819
and County Commissioners begrudgingly

1165
00:44:31,289 --> 00:44:36,550
passing rules for something they didn't

1166
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:38,260
want yep and when you've got a group of

1167
00:44:36,550 --> 00:44:41,050
people making rules for something they

1168
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:46,450
don't like the rules get asinine quick

1169
00:44:41,050 --> 00:44:48,339
and I mean it was terrifying the first

1170
00:44:46,449 --> 00:44:50,169
couple times I went and spoke I think

1171
00:44:48,338 --> 00:44:51,519
the first time I spoke up at a meeting I

1172
00:44:50,170 --> 00:44:54,309
was on the front page of the paper the

1173
00:44:51,519 --> 00:44:56,769
next morning I'm just as an extra little

1174
00:44:54,309 --> 00:45:01,500
like by the way the nail that stands up

1175
00:44:56,769 --> 00:45:04,150
gets hammered down first yep um and then

1176
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:08,130
maybe a year later I was in a meeting

1177
00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:10,809
that City Council put together

1178
00:45:08,130 --> 00:45:15,500
where's people from Planning and Zoning

1179
00:45:10,809 --> 00:45:19,969
and people from the Sheriff's Office

1180
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:23,150
City PD and people from like the water

1181
00:45:19,969 --> 00:45:26,389
department and the Health Department all

1182
00:45:23,150 --> 00:45:29,480
got together to work on what rules do we

1183
00:45:26,389 --> 00:45:31,400
want for home gross and before the

1184
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:34,159
meeting got started the the sheriff's

1185
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:35,900
deputy and the city narcotics cops

1186
00:45:34,159 --> 00:45:38,059
started talking about funny [ __ ] that

1187
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:40,280
had happened with legal pot and they

1188
00:45:38,059 --> 00:45:42,829
mentioned the closing of met amar and

1189
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:45,860
that they had a surveillance camera on

1190
00:45:42,829 --> 00:45:47,299
the back porch the whole time and I just

1191
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:48,380
started giggling because I'm sitting

1192
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:50,210
next to these two listen to the

1193
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:52,190
conversation I was like oh man there was

1194
00:45:50,210 --> 00:45:55,550
a camera there yeah like how many of my

1195
00:45:52,190 --> 00:45:57,619
smoke breaks did they get yeah they got

1196
00:45:55,550 --> 00:45:59,300
me rolling joints on there for hours of

1197
00:45:57,619 --> 00:46:03,170
footage to better now my camera was a

1198
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:06,050
that's funny all right so you said screw

1199
00:46:03,170 --> 00:46:07,700
it just time to go full force and start

1200
00:46:06,050 --> 00:46:09,140
hitting city council with that whatever

1201
00:46:07,699 --> 00:46:11,480
I felt they needed to get smacked with

1202
00:46:09,139 --> 00:46:13,609
and you went for zoning you went for

1203
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:14,990
rule changes you go for any sort of

1204
00:46:13,610 --> 00:46:17,300
hearings or proposals but new

1205
00:46:14,989 --> 00:46:19,789
discussions are coming solid years in my

1206
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:21,530
life yeah yeah you got me going to

1207
00:46:19,789 --> 00:46:22,820
meetings dude I took other dreads to

1208
00:46:21,530 --> 00:46:24,350
meetings like there were a little

1209
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:25,789
section of dreadlocks at the city

1210
00:46:24,349 --> 00:46:27,710
council meetings we all tried to put on

1211
00:46:25,789 --> 00:46:29,449
a decent shirt show up it's kind of fun

1212
00:46:27,710 --> 00:46:31,400
I would have never gone and done that it

1213
00:46:29,449 --> 00:46:33,769
can work for you so that's what some of

1214
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:35,840
you when they realized that I could get

1215
00:46:33,769 --> 00:46:38,829
10 or 15 people to show up if I wanted

1216
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:41,090
to then they really started listening

1217
00:46:38,829 --> 00:46:43,039
because that's what small town

1218
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:44,650
politicians for the most is a little bit

1219
00:46:43,039 --> 00:46:47,090
of crowd making a little bit of noise

1220
00:46:44,650 --> 00:46:48,410
because then the press shows up and then

1221
00:46:47,090 --> 00:46:49,970
it's a real issue that they've got to

1222
00:46:48,409 --> 00:46:51,589
deal with whether they want to or not

1223
00:46:49,969 --> 00:46:53,119
and we were lucky enough to have a

1224
00:46:51,590 --> 00:46:54,710
friend in the press and so they would

1225
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:58,069
always make sure to put our faces on the

1226
00:46:54,710 --> 00:47:00,740
camera on the news they're had friends

1227
00:46:58,070 --> 00:47:02,960
multiple friends yeah yeah we used to

1228
00:47:00,739 --> 00:47:04,429
have a reporter who if we had a cannabis

1229
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:05,750
story you must text her and she would

1230
00:47:04,429 --> 00:47:08,239
drive up to the house and you could give

1231
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:10,130
her the weed story if she needed weed

1232
00:47:08,239 --> 00:47:11,750
details she would text Mike and I hey

1233
00:47:10,130 --> 00:47:13,700
tell me about weed tell me what's going

1234
00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:15,260
on we'd fill her in so the news reports

1235
00:47:13,699 --> 00:47:18,109
are almost close to accurate because of

1236
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:19,790
that stuff if for a while man you've

1237
00:47:18,110 --> 00:47:22,340
done a lot of great [ __ ] in cannabis ah

1238
00:47:19,789 --> 00:47:24,679
like dude from getting involved to get

1239
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:26,210
Dave a card from being my bud tender

1240
00:47:24,679 --> 00:47:27,409
assistant manager whatever you were at

1241
00:47:26,210 --> 00:47:29,010
madam our that was a stressful

1242
00:47:27,409 --> 00:47:31,589
challenging we didn't have an

1243
00:47:29,010 --> 00:47:33,690
Johnson bud tending then yeah we were

1244
00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:35,579
inventing the rules and the systems as

1245
00:47:33,690 --> 00:47:38,039
we happen so it's really interesting and

1246
00:47:35,579 --> 00:47:39,659
fun to watch we had MMJ menu first like

1247
00:47:38,039 --> 00:47:42,739
nobody had that [ __ ] before us we were

1248
00:47:39,659 --> 00:47:46,368
doing it on the black market kinda I

1249
00:47:42,739 --> 00:47:50,699
remember like sort of inventing the

1250
00:47:46,369 --> 00:47:53,970
smell jars and display racks and pre

1251
00:47:50,699 --> 00:47:56,069
rolls and we had awesome displays that

1252
00:47:53,969 --> 00:47:57,929
dispensary always looked so good we had

1253
00:47:56,070 --> 00:47:59,280
nice good systems in place so I've

1254
00:47:57,929 --> 00:48:00,868
always trusted working with you and we

1255
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:02,910
worked at that dispensary then we got

1256
00:48:00,869 --> 00:48:04,530
kind of out of the there wasn't a

1257
00:48:02,909 --> 00:48:06,690
dispensary to work at and then we teamed

1258
00:48:04,530 --> 00:48:08,070
up again for another place and then we

1259
00:48:06,690 --> 00:48:09,210
kind of worked in another place together

1260
00:48:08,070 --> 00:48:10,980
we've been through three facilities

1261
00:48:09,210 --> 00:48:12,960
together me working in the back and you

1262
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:14,519
working up front it's been a lot of fun

1263
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:16,108
where I always try and anytime I get a

1264
00:48:14,519 --> 00:48:18,119
place or an opportunity to bring

1265
00:48:16,108 --> 00:48:19,920

00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:25,409

1269
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:27,570

the cannabis industry cuz I know them

1277
00:48:39,289 --> 00:48:46,230

1278
00:48:41,730 --> 00:48:50,849
the video froze um getting honestly when

1279
00:48:46,230 --> 00:48:54,389
we got Dave his card that was in every

1280
00:48:50,849 --> 00:48:59,819
day couple hours a day year long

1281
00:48:54,389 --> 00:49:05,279
struggle when that first card showed up

1282
00:48:59,820 --> 00:49:07,380
that pay off that like dopamine kick

1283
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:11,250
that sense of accomplishment was [ __ ]

1284
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:13,380
massive yes you can have it in the house

1285
00:49:11,250 --> 00:49:15,510
you can have it the car it's not gonna

1286
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:21,119
go to jail and have a mess at the same

1287
00:49:15,510 --> 00:49:23,850
time right yeah I couldn't imagine him

1288
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:27,030
him having to go to to jail for

1289
00:49:23,849 --> 00:49:30,358
possession that would have been cruel

1290
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:32,850
and stupid beyond words

1291
00:49:30,358 --> 00:49:34,829
and sort of have have that protection in

1292
00:49:32,849 --> 00:49:37,829
place even back then as flimsy as it was

1293
00:49:34,829 --> 00:49:42,000
was was it just astronomical and felt

1294
00:49:37,829 --> 00:49:43,500
really good to have achieved and then

1295
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,300
it's a silly rule and it don't matter

1296
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:48,900
anymore because it's been overwritten by

1297
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:51,539
the state but I got Pueblo County or the

1298
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:54,599
city of Pueblo not to limit plant counts

1299
00:49:51,539 --> 00:49:57,509
and that was like a three year long

1300
00:49:54,599 --> 00:50:00,420
fight where they wanted to limit it and

1301
00:49:57,510 --> 00:50:03,599
they needed to limit it and just slowly

1302
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:05,340
and with reason like the city doesn't

1303
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:07,440
want to get in between patients and

1304
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:09,900
doctors was my whole argument you know

1305
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:13,789
and little by little I won over every

1306
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:16,289
heart and mind one at a [ __ ] time and

1307
00:50:13,789 --> 00:50:17,789
that felt really good still to this day

1308
00:50:16,289 --> 00:50:19,969
the city of Puebla is not a blank

1309
00:50:17,789 --> 00:50:23,009
element they limit you by square footage

1310
00:50:19,969 --> 00:50:25,649
and a state highway that's huge yep the

1311
00:50:23,010 --> 00:50:27,150
state limits you but not the city

1312
00:50:25,650 --> 00:50:30,358
I'm always bitching about that state

1313
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:32,579
limit thank you bro for trying to keep

1314
00:50:30,358 --> 00:50:35,098
me cos for a while I was able to grow

1315
00:50:32,579 --> 00:50:36,659
quite a few plants but now I'm known and

1316
00:50:35,099 --> 00:50:39,090
people know where the [ __ ] I am and they

1317
00:50:36,659 --> 00:50:40,440
whoever they is I say who are they got

1318
00:50:39,090 --> 00:50:41,940
another email address or they don't

1319
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:44,159
exist another email address where I've

1320
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:45,960
talked to they know where I am and they

1321
00:50:44,159 --> 00:50:47,639
know what I do so I got a state one

1322
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:49,079
plant under the count just in case they

1323
00:50:47,639 --> 00:50:50,940
break off a branch try to tell me it's

1324
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:52,529
another one like so that's not a fun

1325
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:54,269
game to play anymore I miss the good old

1326
00:50:52,530 --> 00:50:55,980
days when you could try to explode the

1327
00:50:54,269 --> 00:50:58,588

00:52:11,909 --> 00:52:15,598
what's next

1365
00:52:12,869 --> 00:52:19,349
I love seeing what's new it's been so

1366
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:21,510
much fun watching Colorado evolve like I

1367
00:52:19,349 --> 00:52:24,390
remember going into history class as a

1368
00:52:21,510 --> 00:52:27,030
teenager and being like well hopefully

1369
00:52:24,389 --> 00:52:29,838
we don't have a world war three and I

1370
00:52:27,030 --> 00:52:32,490
mean our Great Depression or a

1371
00:52:29,838 --> 00:52:33,690
prohibition that's close to all three of

1372
00:52:32,489 --> 00:52:39,269
those right now dude that's [ __ ]

1373
00:52:33,690 --> 00:52:43,440
scary but up until cannabis legalization

1374
00:52:39,269 --> 00:52:45,269
there wasn't an obvious like this is

1375
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:47,608
gonna be in the [ __ ] history books

1376
00:52:45,269 --> 00:52:50,699
guaranteed there's gonna be multiple

1377
00:52:47,608 --> 00:52:56,338
chapters on what we're living through

1378
00:52:50,699 --> 00:52:58,710
and when I really started digging into

1379
00:52:56,338 --> 00:53:00,298
like wait a second Colorado has legal

1380
00:52:58,710 --> 00:53:03,179
weed I kind of remember that from when I

1381
00:53:00,298 --> 00:53:04,920
was a freshman in college but it didn't

1382
00:53:03,179 --> 00:53:08,598
mean anything other than like good job

1383
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:08,599
hippie like you're still going to jail

1384
00:53:11,769 --> 00:53:17,320
and that evolved to what we have now I

1385
00:53:14,889 --> 00:53:18,940
remember the first set of rules that

1386
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:21,490
came down and how we went from a

1387
00:53:18,940 --> 00:53:23,380
thousand to retail dispensaries to 500

1388
00:53:21,489 --> 00:53:25,750
overnight

1389
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:29,500
I remember what you're just watching the

1390
00:53:25,750 --> 00:53:32,590
glass evolved like I've got this

1391
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:35,050
beautiful little rig right here nothing

1392
00:53:32,590 --> 00:53:37,510
like this had ever been seen when I

1393
00:53:35,050 --> 00:53:42,490
started doing this the concentrates we

1394
00:53:37,510 --> 00:53:43,840
so now yeah I showed you this in 2008

1395
00:53:42,489 --> 00:53:45,399
I'm gonna bust out this diamond again

1396
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:46,720
just because it's that pretty maybe not

1397
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:48,099
because the containers fighting with me

1398
00:53:46,719 --> 00:53:50,289
and nose on the camera so doesn't want

1399
00:53:48,099 --> 00:53:52,000
to open rewind the video watch that

1400
00:53:50,289 --> 00:53:54,159
diamond at the beginning but if I showed

1401
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,989
you this in 2008 you'd think I was

1402
00:53:54,159 --> 00:53:58,269
giving you drugs we would kick people

1403
00:53:55,989 --> 00:53:59,769
out of the house for using I really

1404
00:53:58,269 --> 00:54:02,800
can't get it open so I don't get to

1405
00:53:59,769 --> 00:54:05,230
smoke this it was a one-time deal I I

1406
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:10,180
had to dispensary the day before 4/20

1407
00:54:05,230 --> 00:54:11,710
and I got six grams of hash and it was

1408
00:54:10,179 --> 00:54:16,629
in a little paper bag and I drove at

1409
00:54:11,710 --> 00:54:19,059
home but in 2004 6 1 gram jars a hash

1410
00:54:16,630 --> 00:54:22,450
meant you were a drug dealer looking to

1411
00:54:19,059 --> 00:54:24,789
distribute six cribs and yep

1412
00:54:22,449 --> 00:54:27,279
and in a lot of places like if you're in

1413
00:54:24,789 --> 00:54:30,940
Texas one gram of hash and one gram of

1414
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:32,430
heroin are legally equal you know just

1415
00:54:30,940 --> 00:54:35,380
as [ __ ] and they weigh the container

1416
00:54:32,429 --> 00:54:37,529
yeah a little glass jar would it take

1417
00:54:35,380 --> 00:54:42,400
this whole glass jar and they go that's

1418
00:54:37,530 --> 00:54:44,800
17 grams of hard drugs enjoy life in

1419
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:47,500
prison with [ __ ]

1420
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:49,300
it's just Colorado's on a different

1421
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:50,949
plane now and watching us go from where

1422
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:54,340
we were to where we are now has been an

1423
00:54:50,949 --> 00:54:57,399
amazing journey as involved in it to be

1424
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:58,720
a part of it I maybe I'll find a hash it

1425
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:01,059
inspires me to finally write the book

1426
00:54:58,719 --> 00:55:02,709
about it but I wasn't gonna ask about

1427
00:55:01,059 --> 00:55:04,389

1432
00:55:11,260 --> 00:55:14,050

00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:28,180
book tour yeah so the other part of that

1441
00:55:26,769 --> 00:55:30,699
was where do you see cannabis in five

1442
00:55:28,179 --> 00:55:32,859
years and also the B part of that is how

1443
00:55:30,699 --> 00:55:34,869
long do you think until we see national

1444
00:55:32,860 --> 00:55:36,490
cannabis legalization so cannabis in

1445
00:55:34,869 --> 00:55:39,869
five years and how long until it's legal

1446
00:55:36,489 --> 00:55:45,879
everywhere see I had a better

1447
00:55:39,869 --> 00:55:47,889
guesstimate pre-pandemic oh yes mmm

1448
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:52,420
nothing's gonna be the same after this

1449
00:55:47,889 --> 00:55:55,509
folks like I mean every little facet of

1450
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:57,940
life is gonna get tweaked to some

1451
00:55:55,510 --> 00:55:59,850
degrees slightly different 2% different

1452
00:55:57,940 --> 00:56:02,460
everywhere

1453
00:55:59,849 --> 00:56:04,739
at least the minute the stuff that

1454
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:08,190
almost stays the same is gonna be two

1455
00:56:04,739 --> 00:56:10,439
percent different personal greetings

1456
00:56:08,190 --> 00:56:13,590
no more handshakes bro oh yeah those are

1457
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:17,579
gone yeah people wearing masks at the

1458
00:56:13,590 --> 00:56:19,470

1459
00:56:17,579 --> 00:56:22,949
dispensary buying weed in the parking

00:56:19,469 --> 00:56:24,959
lots again is cool at the dispensary we

1461
00:56:22,949 --> 00:56:27,599
got go cups now in Colorado we didn't

1462
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:30,570
have go cups before coronavirus now we

1463
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:32,250
got go Cubs go cups for those of you who

1464
00:56:30,570 --> 00:56:35,160
don't know is you can go to a restaurant

1465
00:56:32,250 --> 00:56:37,769
and get a margarita in a plastic cup

1466
00:56:35,159 --> 00:56:39,329
with sulfate around the top is your I

1467
00:56:37,769 --> 00:56:42,630
promise not to drink this time home

1468
00:56:39,329 --> 00:56:44,420
officer seal just sort of like when we

1469
00:56:42,630 --> 00:56:46,800
buy a joint now it comes in a little to

1470
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:48,840
help me promise not to let that [ __ ] up

1471
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:51,030
so we you know as long as you serve food

1472
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:54,660
you're allowed to sell alcohol to go as

1473
00:56:51,030 --> 00:56:56,310
well now yep for right now though there

1474
00:56:54,659 --> 00:56:58,170
was a rumor that the state was going to

1475
00:56:56,309 --> 00:57:01,079
take that privilege away already and

1476
00:56:58,170 --> 00:57:03,090
they clarified that as long as the sales

1477
00:57:01,079 --> 00:57:03,750
transaction happens inside the

1478
00:57:03,090 --> 00:57:05,579
restaurant

1479
00:57:03,750 --> 00:57:07,769
meaning you ordered your [ __ ] through

1480
00:57:05,579 --> 00:57:10,170
the app on your phone and the payment

1481
00:57:07,769 --> 00:57:11,969
was technically processed inside and

1482
00:57:10,170 --> 00:57:14,639
you're not handing someone a 20 from

1483
00:57:11,969 --> 00:57:17,909
your car window sales still legit

1484
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:19,259
awesome oh it's so [ __ ] arbitrary but

1485
00:57:17,909 --> 00:57:20,819
a lot of those are getting worked on

1486
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:22,590
including there's a whole bunch of them

1487
00:57:20,820 --> 00:57:25,650
for cannabis that they dialed back right

1488
00:57:22,590 --> 00:57:26,940
away so that we could do curbside none

1489
00:57:25,650 --> 00:57:28,470
of that shit's going back the way it

1490
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:30,450
used to be none of it

1491
00:57:28,469 --> 00:57:31,889
you need to take a break roll em you

1492
00:57:30,449 --> 00:57:33,509
know I hear the monitor going you just

1493
00:57:31,889 --> 00:57:35,039
finished that bottle I made him we'll

1494
00:57:33,510 --> 00:57:37,230
see what if he goes back to sleep now

1495
00:57:35,039 --> 00:57:38,550
already will cool I'm probably not gonna

1496
00:57:37,230 --> 00:57:39,809
edit out the last break it was

1497
00:57:38,550 --> 00:57:43,019
interesting that's fine

1498
00:57:39,809 --> 00:57:45,389
just maybe yammering for a minute so to

1499
00:57:43,019 --> 00:57:47,400
continue with that how long do you till

1500
00:57:45,389 --> 00:57:48,480
you think we have legalization or do you

1501
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:49,980
think we'll see that we should see that

1502
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:50,909
in our light in your lifetime I don't

1503
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:52,170
know which one of us will live longer

1504
00:57:50,909 --> 00:57:55,139
but I also see that in our lifetimes

1505
00:57:52,170 --> 00:57:56,970
right now I mean my take is Trump is

1506
00:57:55,139 --> 00:57:59,789
truly terrified and panicked about

1507
00:57:56,969 --> 00:58:04,309
re-election and so between now and

1508
00:57:59,789 --> 00:58:04,309
November I think

1509
00:58:05,309 --> 00:58:13,900
cannabis legalization is it has out of

1510
00:58:10,269 --> 00:58:17,559
nowhere potential more than it's ever

1511
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:20,079
had before because the person in top who

1512
00:58:17,559 --> 00:58:22,059
can really push to make it happen is is

1513
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:24,699
panicked as they've ever been and is

1514
00:58:22,059 --> 00:58:26,320
incompetent as they've ever been if you

1515
00:58:24,699 --> 00:58:29,500
disagree with me you know or my twitter

1516
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:33,480
is and if you agree let's calm

1517
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:38,920
forward-slash way Mike exactly but I

1518
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:41,829
honestly think that there's a maybe

1519
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:44,980
10-15 percent chance that Trump tries to

1520
00:58:41,829 --> 00:58:49,838
throw marijuana legalization is a way to

1521
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:53,940
come at Biden from the left right

1522
00:58:49,838 --> 00:58:57,549
towards the end of election season and

1523
00:58:53,940 --> 00:59:01,059
honestly it's just attrition now still

1524
00:58:57,550 --> 00:59:02,859
wouldn't starts then down have yeah I

1525
00:59:01,059 --> 00:59:05,650
still wouldn't vote for me that more

1526
00:59:02,858 --> 00:59:08,139
states then don't have medical or reckon

1527
00:59:05,650 --> 00:59:13,838
Al and it's gotten to the point where

1528
00:59:08,139 --> 00:59:16,598
the DEA the FDA NIDA are all being

1529
00:59:13,838 --> 00:59:20,949
forced to reevaluate their positions on

1530
00:59:16,599 --> 00:59:22,660
marijuana and like if we catch you with

1531
00:59:20,949 --> 00:59:24,789
it we'll throw you in jail is slowly

1532
00:59:22,659 --> 00:59:27,338
becoming there's a lot of medical uses

1533
00:59:24,789 --> 00:59:31,779
we need more research and I mean little

1534
00:59:27,338 --> 00:59:33,820
by little we're winning and I mean the

1535
00:59:31,780 --> 00:59:35,980
prohibition latticework is crumbling

1536
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:39,180
it's just how long until it crumbles and

1537
00:59:35,980 --> 00:59:42,849
and it's so hard to guess that now

1538
00:59:39,179 --> 00:59:45,969
especially during this chaos society

1539
00:59:42,849 --> 00:59:48,789
tends to swing like on a pendulum left

1540
00:59:45,969 --> 00:59:51,149
to right conservative to liberal and if

1541
00:59:48,789 --> 00:59:57,690
you look at the last hundred years the

1542
00:59:51,150 --> 01:00:00,730
roaring 20s like sexual liberation music

1543
00:59:57,690 --> 01:00:02,829
lots of liberal social advancements and

1544
01:00:00,730 --> 01:00:04,570
then at the end of the center at the end

1545
01:00:02,829 --> 01:00:06,639
of the decade with the economic crash

1546
01:00:04,570 --> 01:00:09,519
things went super conservative again and

1547
01:00:06,639 --> 01:00:13,088
they stayed that way for a long time and

1548
01:00:09,519 --> 01:00:15,130
we slowly work our way back out and then

1549
01:00:13,088 --> 01:00:17,259
same thing happened again in the sixties

1550
01:00:15,130 --> 01:00:20,338
the summer love happened and that led us

1551
01:00:17,260 --> 01:00:20,339
the [ __ ] Reagan era

1552
01:00:20,590 --> 01:00:25,190
like we could fully be going through

1553
01:00:24,469 --> 01:00:27,429
that again

1554
01:00:25,190 --> 01:00:30,940
and honestly cannabis has been on a big

1555
01:00:27,429 --> 01:00:34,219
liberalisation push for a long time and

1556
01:00:30,940 --> 01:00:37,280
I don't see the pendulum swinging back

1557
01:00:34,219 --> 01:00:42,980
on this one but it could it fully could

1558
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:47,080
got a watch right now the anti pop

1559
01:00:42,980 --> 01:00:47,079
movements never been as ginned up and is

1560
01:00:48,699 --> 01:00:53,929
quick with messaging as they are now

1561
01:00:51,159 --> 01:00:57,649
they were a lot more powerful in the 80s

1562
01:00:53,929 --> 01:01:00,409
and 90s than they are today but the

1563
01:00:57,650 --> 01:01:01,730
remnants still have plenty of month yeah

1564
01:01:00,409 --> 01:01:05,869
and they started the full weight and

1565
01:01:01,730 --> 01:01:07,460
backing in federal government so a lot

1566
01:01:05,869 --> 01:01:09,829
of that generation that doesn't approve

1567
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:11,570
is on its way out like they're too old

1568
01:01:09,829 --> 01:01:12,920
to keep fighting us you know what I mean

1569
01:01:11,570 --> 01:01:14,960
that's the generate two generations

1570
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:16,760
above us a generation above us the older

1571
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:21,860
crew doesn't approve people our age were

1572
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:23,660
in so not that I'm excited for old

1573
01:01:21,860 --> 01:01:25,160
people to pass but I mean that's the

1574
01:01:23,659 --> 01:01:26,899
opposite that's where we're headed but

1575
01:01:25,159 --> 01:01:28,339
on a way yeah the batons got to get

1576
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:29,809
passed and then what are we gonna have

1577
01:01:28,340 --> 01:01:32,059
to deal with what are the kids behind us

1578
01:01:29,809 --> 01:01:34,369
gonna be into legalized everything

1579
01:01:32,059 --> 01:01:37,150
pretty soon we'll see with but that's

1580
01:01:34,369 --> 01:01:39,859
the thing is with prohibition once you

1581
01:01:37,150 --> 01:01:41,630
like it's especially ridiculous when it

1582
01:01:39,860 --> 01:01:45,710
comes to cannabis there's there's no

1583
01:01:41,630 --> 01:01:50,050
logical reason why cannabis products of

1584
01:01:45,710 --> 01:01:54,050
any kind should be prohibited but

1585
01:01:50,050 --> 01:01:57,980
prohibition is a policy is terrible

1586
01:01:54,050 --> 01:01:59,210
it's just bad social policy and if you

1587
01:01:57,980 --> 01:02:00,650
want to get down to it the most

1588
01:01:59,210 --> 01:02:03,230
dangerous [ __ ] in society isn't

1589
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:06,050
prohibited it's highly regulated and

1590
01:02:03,230 --> 01:02:10,730
restricted and under that model its

1591
01:02:06,050 --> 01:02:14,330
controllable like frighteningly kind of

1592
01:02:10,730 --> 01:02:16,690
creepy so like you can order the parts

1593
01:02:14,329 --> 01:02:19,489
for a nuclear bomb on the Internet

1594
01:02:16,690 --> 01:02:21,500
there's a really creepy story of a Nazi

1595
01:02:19,489 --> 01:02:24,799
in Maine who did it and finished it and

1596
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:26,599
the only reason the terrible [ __ ] didn't

1597
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:30,140
happen is because he was also abusive

1598
01:02:26,599 --> 01:02:31,789
and his wife killed him called the cops

1599
01:02:30,139 --> 01:02:32,239
on herself and when the cops showed up

1600
01:02:31,789 --> 01:02:33,739
there

1601
01:02:32,239 --> 01:02:36,459
what's in the sink and she was like oh

1602
01:02:33,739 --> 01:02:36,459
that's a bomb

1603
01:02:38,679 --> 01:02:43,069
but it's it's highly regulated and

1604
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:44,500
restricted and then you look at stuff

1605
01:02:43,070 --> 01:02:46,519
like narcotics and they're prohibited

1606
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:47,960
don't Google that because your Google

1607
01:02:46,519 --> 01:02:51,469
[ __ ] search history will be [ __ ]

1608
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:53,059
forever but then if you look at like

1609
01:02:51,469 --> 01:02:55,909
when drugs were legal

1610
01:02:53,059 --> 01:02:59,210
how were they used in and whatnot and

1611
01:02:55,909 --> 01:03:00,199
when heroin was legal housewives were

1612
01:02:59,210 --> 01:03:05,090
drinking laudanum

1613
01:03:00,199 --> 01:03:06,859
a load potency oral consumption I'm if

1614
01:03:05,090 --> 01:03:10,670
you rent Tombstone Wyatt Earp's wife

1615
01:03:06,860 --> 01:03:12,829
that's the drug she's have gone and it

1616
01:03:10,670 --> 01:03:15,980
was sort of like meth in the 50 is when

1617
01:03:12,829 --> 01:03:19,039
housewife's were taking it to stay perky

1618
01:03:15,980 --> 01:03:21,199
and skinny it's it's a much lower dose

1619
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:25,090
it doesn't have the overdose potential

1620
01:03:21,199 --> 01:03:28,489
the [ __ ] teeth weren't falling out

1621
01:03:25,090 --> 01:03:32,950
like no Breaking Bad nonsense happening

1622
01:03:28,489 --> 01:03:37,369
it was just pharmaceutical pure clean

1623
01:03:32,949 --> 01:03:37,819
specific dosage specific timing to take

1624
01:03:37,369 --> 01:03:40,400
it

1625
01:03:37,820 --> 01:03:43,160
dosage recommendations same thing with

1626
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:44,869
laudanum and when you really start to

1627
01:03:43,159 --> 01:03:48,170
look at all this [ __ ] kind of as a whole

1628
01:03:44,869 --> 01:03:50,659
picture thing the idea that cops are

1629
01:03:48,170 --> 01:03:52,639
gonna stop people from doing heroin if

1630
01:03:50,659 --> 01:03:54,230
they feel like doing heroin like it just

1631
01:03:52,639 --> 01:03:56,089
doesn't make any sense of doom

1632
01:03:54,230 --> 01:03:58,010
if people's families don't stop them

1633
01:03:56,090 --> 01:04:00,800
from doing heroin the cops are gonna do

1634
01:03:58,010 --> 01:04:03,260
it and if if you look across society

1635
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:08,560
right now we've got things like safe

1636
01:04:03,260 --> 01:04:12,680
injection sites methadone clinics

1637
01:04:08,559 --> 01:04:14,289
marijuana dispensaries psilocybin

1638
01:04:12,679 --> 01:04:16,669
legalization and decriminalization

1639
01:04:14,289 --> 01:04:18,769
measures are hitting the ballots all

1640
01:04:16,670 --> 01:04:21,889
across the country Denver just

1641
01:04:18,769 --> 01:04:24,259
decriminalized psilocybin California

1642
01:04:21,889 --> 01:04:27,609
before Co vid was working on signatures

1643
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:31,130
to decriminalize across the state like

1644
01:04:27,610 --> 01:04:33,079
the the framework that put prohibition

1645
01:04:31,130 --> 01:04:35,660
in place is all slowly starting to

1646
01:04:33,079 --> 01:04:37,489
crumble more and more people are waking

1647
01:04:35,659 --> 01:04:39,799
up to the idea that these are terrible

1648
01:04:37,489 --> 01:04:41,419
[ __ ] policies they'll lead to all

1649
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:44,930
sorts of destruction that we're not

1650
01:04:41,420 --> 01:04:45,980
intending when you really get into the

1651
01:04:44,929 --> 01:04:47,960
dollar amount and we're

1652
01:04:45,980 --> 01:04:49,789
it's going and what we're funding with

1653
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:52,159
our moral high-ground it's just [ __ ]

1654
01:04:49,789 --> 01:04:53,630
nuts you know just put people in jail to

1655
01:04:52,159 --> 01:04:55,159
keep them in jail to [ __ ] up their lives

1656
01:04:53,630 --> 01:04:57,019
to [ __ ] up their futures to [ __ ] up

1657
01:04:55,159 --> 01:04:58,670
their lives again yeah exactly like

1658
01:04:57,019 --> 01:05:00,920
where do you see yourself in the future

1659
01:04:58,670 --> 01:05:02,210
of cannabis we've come a long way but

1660
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:04,220
we're getting old things are getting

1661
01:05:02,210 --> 01:05:08,449
weird where do we go next

1662
01:05:04,219 --> 01:05:09,199
I'm in a weird place man I don't know

1663
01:05:08,449 --> 01:05:11,509
what's next

1664
01:05:09,199 --> 01:05:13,819
I'm on pause right now I was doing a

1665
01:05:11,510 --> 01:05:15,350
bunch of consulting before covin but

1666
01:05:13,820 --> 01:05:16,940

1671
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:27,108

1675
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,849
important question for you and we're

1676
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:36,710

1680
01:05:39,949 --> 01:05:42,710
best interviewer in my opinion so it's

1681
01:05:41,539 --> 01:05:44,389
really comfortable having my best friend

1682
01:05:42,710 --> 01:05:45,949
as my interviewee I had this

1683
01:05:44,389 --> 01:05:47,389
conversation with myself a moment ago I

1684
01:05:45,949 --> 01:05:49,460
don't know what to call you but the guy

1685
01:05:47,389 --> 01:05:50,989
on that end I was an honor to have you

1686
01:05:49,460 --> 01:05:53,480

your first video I keep it up um the

1688
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:56,480
most important question of the night bro

1689
01:05:55,519 --> 01:05:57,858
and I already know the answer because

1690
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:59,119
we've been friends for so long but I've

1691
01:05:57,858 --> 01:06:01,400
got to include this into my interview

1692
01:05:59,119 --> 01:06:04,250
here what's your favorite strain to

1693
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:06,950
smoke you gotta go with the Grateful dog

1694
01:06:04,250 --> 01:06:09,139
oh man that puts a smile on my face not

1695
01:06:06,949 --> 01:06:11,689
some something that's not yours it's

1696
01:06:09,139 --> 01:06:14,868
gotta be Kem dog or Sour Diesel

1697
01:06:11,690 --> 01:06:16,608
that's a closed City sour really close

1698
01:06:14,869 --> 01:06:18,230
to the Grateful dog The Grateful dog is

1699
01:06:16,608 --> 01:06:20,539
bred by myself the Grateful dog is

1700
01:06:18,230 --> 01:06:25,250
honestly a Deadhead og

1701
01:06:20,539 --> 01:06:27,710
inbred project deadhead OG is a chem d2

1702
01:06:25,250 --> 01:06:31,070
or no it's the chem 91 to San Fernando

1703
01:06:27,710 --> 01:06:34,099
Valley OG Kush f4 and then I got a

1704
01:06:31,070 --> 01:06:37,160
Grateful dog select phenotype a Deadhead

1705
01:06:34,099 --> 01:06:38,719
phenotype and I reversed it I called the

1706
01:06:37,159 --> 01:06:41,839
seeds that came from that were known as

1707
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:44,689
grateful dog I took another seed from

1708
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:46,579
that and grew it out and then I reversed

1709
01:06:44,690 --> 01:06:49,400
the original grateful dog and put that

1710
01:06:46,579 --> 01:06:51,108
pollen onto that seed and it made more

1711
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:54,349
seeds the seeds that came from Matt

1712
01:06:51,108 --> 01:06:56,840
won't reverse like they come out real it

1713
01:06:54,349 --> 01:06:58,769
yeah that there's a lot of weirdness

1714
01:06:56,840 --> 01:07:00,420
going on but I can't

1715
01:06:58,769 --> 01:07:02,969
verse number 77 either I call that one

1716
01:07:00,420 --> 01:07:04,349
77 to select that one doesn't reverse I

1717
01:07:02,969 --> 01:07:05,969
could treat it with silver thiosulfate

1718
01:07:04,349 --> 01:07:08,429
it won't cross but it's really cool

1719
01:07:05,969 --> 01:07:11,339
knowing bit your favorite strain is

1720
01:07:08,429 --> 01:07:12,750
something that I bring then yeah that's

1721
01:07:11,340 --> 01:07:14,250
that's awesome is when I grow it you

1722
01:07:12,750 --> 01:07:17,010
always kind of drool a little bit so

1723
01:07:14,250 --> 01:07:20,610
that's pretty awesome I know it's not

1724
01:07:17,010 --> 01:07:23,040
just the potency like it's it's

1725
01:07:20,610 --> 01:07:26,460
something in the genetics that plant

1726
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:28,920
just that herb and my head were meant to

1727
01:07:26,460 --> 01:07:30,780
go together it's something those are two

1728
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:32,579
amazing genetics you got OG Kush and

1729
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:34,590
chem dog the chem gives you that sweet

1730
01:07:32,579 --> 01:07:36,509
stank funk and the OG Kush gives you

1731
01:07:34,590 --> 01:07:38,130
similar but more earthy and then they

1732
01:07:36,510 --> 01:07:40,710
both have a yeah it's just a beautiful

1733
01:07:38,130 --> 01:07:42,150
combo wasn't my original idea I worked

1734
01:07:40,710 --> 01:07:44,460
with it I kind of inbred it I did some

1735
01:07:42,150 --> 01:07:45,930
stuff so that's my story and I'm

1736

sticking to it Mike I'm glad that's your
