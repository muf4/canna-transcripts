200
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:20,160
kind of early like maybe 30 minutes

201
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:21,959
before the doors were supposed to open

202
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,759
so we were in line pretty early and

203
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:26,399
that's they just let us in and then the

204
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:29,240
group ahead of us was like of six dudes

205
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:31,519
and there's only seven front row seats M

206
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,680

207
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:34,598
that so they're like all right you guys

208

209
00:07:34,598 --> 00:07:37,800
like an ideology of like they're going

210
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:39,038

251
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:04,879
the Comedy Works they have a menu

252
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,200
hanging from the chair in front of you

253
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:09,278
they took that they took the pen uh they

254
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:12,360
made everybody take off their hats yeah

255
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:13,838
it was no logos like I said they were

256
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:16,919
moving ugly people to the back of the

257
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:19,160
room like definitely intense back row

258
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:20,838
they sat me under a camera like the

259
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:22,360
camera was right above my head that's

260
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:23,959
why that's why I feel like a couple of

261
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:26,079
the jokes Joe was looking me in his eyes

262
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:27,759
telling them to me because gave him

263
00:09:26,078 --> 00:09:29,159
right yeah the camera was above my head

264
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:30,519
and it made it feel instead of talk to

265
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:32,159
that machine he could just talk to me

266
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:34,959
and it felt a little more natural cuz I

267
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:37,039

00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:41,479
was on par yeah definitely [ __ ] he's

325
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:43,439
got some really good jokes but and I

326
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:46,560
mean not only that but you say Joe Rogan

327
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:48,760
killed it I mean as a comic to be up

328
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:50,479
there for an hour Jesus yeah you know

329
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:52,759
and I me and him talked about it

330
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:55,240
afterwards you know he was really

331
00:11:52,759 --> 00:11:57,399
nervous you could see the nerves at

332
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:59,720
thees thought but then the lady heckled

333
00:11:57,399 --> 00:12:02,200
him I heard about that you told me as

334
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,959
soon as she heckled him he came out of

335
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,720
the like nervous thing went away and

336
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:07,039
he's like what [ __ ] and he kind of went

337
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:09,079
off on her for a minute and when he came

338
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:11,199
back to the set he was on point from

339
00:12:09,078 --> 00:12:13,479
then on I think that Heckler kind of

340
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,839
helped him out kind of helped him and it

341
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:17,600
brought the crowd and him together

342
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:19,160
before before that there was a a barrier

343
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,240
between the performer and the crowd

344
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:23,958
because called cameras yeah yeah that

345
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,440
tension in there affected our laughter

346
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:28,359
and his performance but once that

347
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:31,000
Heckler all of that we became one yeah

348
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:32,480
that's uh does Tony henchcliffe and you

349
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,440
guys can laugh your asses off if you

350
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:37,759
want does Tony henchcliffe slightly

351
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:40,240
remind you of Ina Luhan yeah he's got

352
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:42,278
the look The really mellow calmness you

353
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,000
can't shake him nerves of Steel just

354
00:12:42,278 --> 00:12:46,519
kind of feels like his you know he's

355
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,600
kind of always up here you know hold his

356
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:50,720
hands and slightly a hipster I don't I

357
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:52,680
don't know what I I I looked at him and

358
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:56,320
I I didn't think that he

359
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:58,599
felt like like he was having fun he just

360
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,639
like his sense of humor is so like yeah

361
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:02,600
it's kind of like this and so it just it

362
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:04,278
wasn't I wish he'd had been having more

363
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:06,480
fun while he was telling his jokes they

364
00:13:04,278 --> 00:13:07,720
did invite him back for a weekend so we

365
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,240
got to pay attention to when Tony Hench

366
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,639
Cliff is coming to comedy work go to

367
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:13,240
that yeah I'd love to see I'd love to

368
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:16,440
see more than how he probably did 20 did

369
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:17,680
about 15 when we saw him i' say yeah so

370
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,800
I'll let's talk of Comedy I guess I'm

371
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:22,239
going to keep going uh Sunday night I

372
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:24,439
went to the Oddball Comedy Fest the

373
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,480
Oddball comedy tour with Hardwick uh

374
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:28,440
that was amazing was he like headlining

375
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,240
it was he the no he was actually second

376
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:32,480
uh Lou CK headlined there were nine

377
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,079
comedians I think there were Brody

378
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,879
Stevens was the host and he said nine

379
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:37,359
comedians he must have been one of the

380
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:39,278
performers that he counted cuz I can't

381
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,959
think of who the other the others were

382
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:45,320
it was uh Brody Stevens Whitney Cummings

383
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:46,278
Chris Hardwick Demitri Martin um

384

Marin uh did you say Louis already

389
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:59,599
somebody and then Louis CK who was

390
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:01,519
before yeah Jo Rivers

391
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,240
it might have been Jones that set was

392
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,159
quite stale I'm going to Google it

393
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:08,000
because I feel bad missing somebody on

394
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:10,360
that list where's that losing Price Is

395
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,480
Right theme when you

396
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:15,360
need I'm looking for it I really want to

397
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:18,639
get it right cuz I feel bad um we read

398
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,720
the list I mean Red Rocks seems like I

399
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:22,120
haven't been down there yet but it

400
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:23,680
definitely I saw the picture posted and

401
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:27,039
sorry as who I'm forgetting how did you

402
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:30,799
forget aiz whoa cuz you're so

403
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:33,278
little no aiz was great uh I think

404
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:35,198
everybody got 15 minutes but I think

405
00:14:33,278 --> 00:14:37,278
Louie may have gotten it seemed like Lou

406
00:14:35,198 --> 00:14:39,278
did 30 minutes and if you're a comedy

407
00:14:37,278 --> 00:14:41,879
fan uh we've gone on for a minute but

408
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:44,320
you'll get this part every single second

409
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:46,600
of Louis set was calculated he knew

410
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:49,560
where to where to breathe he knew where

411
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:51,399
to take a couple of steps I don't think

412
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:52,719
and I'm not a comedian but I I've paid

413
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:54,799
enough attention to you guys I'm friends

414
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,199
with all you comedian guys and I've paid

415
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:58,719
enough attention to what you say and so

416
00:14:56,198 --> 00:15:01,000
I get it now and I could feel every

417
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:03,480
minute of him he crushed it dude always

418
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,198
be crushing was Louis's motto that night

419
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:07,480
[ __ ] awesome he was killing it dude

420
00:15:05,198 --> 00:15:09,159
on it I I need to see him now yeah now

421
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:11,720
just just to see his mannerisms but

422
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:13,919
you've performed you know so it's it's

423
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:16,320
also performance you understand like

424
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:18,479
when the singer does it in this note it

425
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,759
sounds a lot better than this note

426
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,000
that's like one octave higher or

427
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:24,759
whatever being the drummer my thing is

428
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,360
to play less if I overplay as a drummer

429
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:28,199
then you sound like you're insecure when

430
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:30,039
you learn to get older and play less

431
00:15:28,198 --> 00:15:32,758
notes it's when you sound better and I

432
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:35,318
think Louis has learned each note

433
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:36,440
perfectly Lou I and honestly not to

434
00:15:35,318 --> 00:15:38,759
sound like an [ __ ] he was one of the

435
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:40,440
comedians I was not most excited to see

436
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:42,039
yeah haven't you seen him before no I've

437
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,720
never seen Lou CK perform before I've

438
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:46,278
never seen any of those guys perform

439
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:48,680
live before was so I got to see n the

440
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:51,679
world's best uh Aziz was good really

441
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:53,719
high energy uh stuck to the same joke

442
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:55,519
basically the whole time told like a

443
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:58,040
story with a lot of taglines and a lot

444
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:59,720
of callbacks so that was cool Hardwick I

445
00:15:58,039 --> 00:16:02,039
was being

446
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:04,839
this affects my podcast hosting uh I

447
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:07,120
listen to Nerdist often uh I watch at

448
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:09,759
midnight uh I've followed Hardwick since

449
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:11,679
the freaking uh singled out days so I

450
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:14,079
know he's from Denver I know how he used

451
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:16,000
to play in a band with Ferman called my

452
00:16:14,078 --> 00:16:17,679
Harden ferm so they come out he comes

453
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,958
out at Red Rocks and he puts his hands

454
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:20,719
up in the air in the there and he's like

455
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:23,318
red rocks and I could see the

456
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,519
15-year-old boy in him that's wanted to

457
00:16:23,318 --> 00:16:27,159
do that since the first time he touched

458
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:29,198
a guitar I was like that was his dream

459
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:31,159
just he's he just [ __ ] his pants I

460
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:32,719
could see it that's [ __ ] awesome yeah

461
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:35,278
and I kind of got to share that with my

462
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,079
friend Chris Hardwick through podcasting

463
00:16:35,278 --> 00:16:38,639
and that relationship that I feel that

464
00:16:37,078 --> 00:16:40,838
stalker relationship that you feel like

465
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,600
you have with all the celebrities follow

466
00:16:40,839 --> 00:16:45,120
now I I did feel like that with Joe

467
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:47,879
Rogan like I felt like this is my buddy

468
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,600
performing yeah and and I've known him

469
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:51,120
and then I wanted to like as he was

470
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,440
walking off the stage I wanted to shake

471
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,720
his hand and stuff but I was just like

472
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:57,399
also like he's he's not a guy you know

473
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:59,440
and that's a weird thing to like have

474
00:16:57,399 --> 00:17:01,919
this relationship with people that like

475
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,440
is a one-sided relationship yeah but I

476
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:05,240
could see that like I would probably do

477
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,600
the same thing with Hardwick it's just

478
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:09,720
be like I felt Pride for him like one of

479
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:11,480
my buddies just crushed it at Red Rocks

480
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:14,439
cuz he was awesome he did a great great

481
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:17,318
set his set was uh man he's kind of a

482
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:18,558
pervert dude he did uh he he did a joke

483
00:17:17,318 --> 00:17:20,000
and I don't want to blow his bit but

484
00:17:18,558 --> 00:17:22,279
half of his bit was about [ __ ] your

485
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,318
mom that's funny like yeah yeah and for

486
00:17:22,279 --> 00:17:26,038
Hardwick to go that route at Red Rocks

487
00:17:24,318 --> 00:17:27,959
was it was funny for me that's pretty

488
00:17:26,038 --> 00:17:30,400
great uh Dimitri Martin did his thing

489
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:32,080
Demetri Martin he surprised me how funny

490
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,160
he was my date that I took with me she

491
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:36,599
loved him that's who she went to see so

492
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,840
that was good we got to chuckle at that

493
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:40,918
uh DJ Trauma is a killer DJ by the way

494
00:17:38,839 --> 00:17:42,119
he's the one that ran music uh between

495
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:44,000
The Comedians and then we took a

496
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:45,959
15minute intermission this was about a

497
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,798
30-minute intermission I believe if you

498
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:49,880
do comedy for too long you burn out your

499
00:17:47,798 --> 00:17:51,279
funny oh yeah yeah so they gave a nice

500
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:53,960
intermission and we stood up and danced

501
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:55,879
for a few uh Hannibal baress was great

502
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:57,960
he did his thing uh he made a joke about

503
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:00,600
Colorado having the ugliest crowd and

504
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:02,519
then he said it looks like y came from a

505
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:03,959
hike and then he thought about it he

506
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:05,319
goes you probably all just did and then

507
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,919
he made a joke about who was the white

508
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:08,798
guy that broke down out here and decided

509
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:10,120
let's build a venue we can do shows here

510
00:18:08,798 --> 00:18:13,038
because Red Rocks is kind of in the

511
00:18:10,119 --> 00:18:15,678
middle of nowhere yeah uh Louis CK Crush

512
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:17,519
like I said Mark Marin was good his

513
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,960
closer was solid but you could tell he

514
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:22,839
was frazzled and didn't know what to do

515
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:24,759
with 15 minutes Marin's used to 45 to

516
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:26,879
whittle Marin down to 15 minutes is kind

517
00:18:24,759 --> 00:18:28,279
of like you got to give him time to get

518
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,600
out on the stage and sit down at the

519
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:31,399
edge of the stage and get pissed off

520
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:33,759
about something and then he gets into

521
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:35,600
that Mark Marin thing he didn't get time

522
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:38,200
for that in his 15 I didn't feel he was

523
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:39,879
good his closer was hilarious like I

524
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:42,080
won't blow anybody's bit on purpose but

525
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:45,600
his closer was great Sarah Silverman

526
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:47,960
surprised the [ __ ] out of me uh her set

527
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:49,918
was great but she is funny like she is

528
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:52,558
naturally funny you could just

529
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:56,400
tell Whitney Cummings [ __ ] yells her

530
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:57,759
set at you like I'm Whitney and my jokes

531
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,960
are funny so you're going to laugh

532
00:18:57,759 --> 00:19:01,038
punchline like and it's what it feels

533
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:03,679
like the whole time it feels like you're

534
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:06,240
being barraged with jokes she was funny

535
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:07,519
but it was a bit [ __ ] too much for me

536
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,798
you're just saying the way she delivered

537
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:11,839
them could have been better she forgot

538
00:19:09,798 --> 00:19:14,839
she had a microphone and she had to yell

539
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:16,639
she was she was Roman style like and I

540
00:19:14,839 --> 00:19:18,079
felt that way about her TV shows like

541
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,720
when she's on TV she doesn't feel like

542
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:22,319
she's speaking she feels like she's over

543
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:24,038
projecting to me too much uh and then

544
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:26,678
Brody Stevens needs medication Brody

545
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:28,279

549
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,120
like I don't know man maybe you smoke

550

551
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:39,319
at that show you were [ __ ] losing

huge fan of Brody Stevens yeah it's just

554
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:46,799

there well it's just like anything like

556
00:19:46,798 --> 00:19:50,720
I'm I'm so glad that there's some people

557
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,319

558

everybody liked it it'd be like wow that

559
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:56,558

585
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:50,479

do an all an episode All About Women in

602
00:21:17,278 --> 00:21:21,240

out if you guys have any ideas for women

605
00:21:22,839 --> 00:21:27,278
in cannabis it feels sexist a guy doing

606
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:28,678
a show all about women in cannabis so

607
00:21:27,278 --> 00:21:30,240
anything I come up with I feel like it

608
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:32,120
be gender biased and it'll be weird so

609
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:35,359
ladies send me some stuff so that I can

610
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:36,599

613
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:45,120

614
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,759

744
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:09,919
guy on Instagram today and uh he asked

745
00:26:07,798 --> 00:26:11,440
me to donate to a charity and I will

746
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:13,480

00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:21,798
[ __ ] in a podcast each

750
00:26:18,398 --> 00:26:23,038
episode however many times you say [ __ ]

751
00:26:21,798 --> 00:26:24,359
you have to donate to a different

752
00:26:23,038 --> 00:26:25,919
charity that way you're spreading it

753
00:26:24,359 --> 00:26:27,678
around maybe well hopefully I don't say

754

yeah baby food that's just what I use I

806
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:11,159

807
00:28:09,278 --> 00:28:12,480
Walmart and there being none you know

808
00:28:11,159 --> 00:28:13,720
after you drive to both Walmarts on

809

really want to go out the West no I just

811
00:28:16,359 --> 00:28:21,759
98 cents you know you scoop it out you

812
00:28:18,519 --> 00:28:24,200
clean it out leave it let it dry and

813

then yeah it's it's good in there and

814
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:27,880
that's that's perfect for an e you know

815
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
especially like a fluffy eight that's

816
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:30,159
that's but you got to wait until you got

817
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,159
to make sure your weed's dry enough to

818
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:33,960
go into a jar I was about to say that's

819
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:35,240
where I derailed you I no I'm I'm on it

820
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,919
bro I'm getting good at this podcast

821
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:38,278
thing when my weed when I'm curing and

822
00:28:36,919 --> 00:28:40,600
drying my weed I'll leave it a little

823
00:28:38,278 --> 00:28:42,440
bit extra moist for my personal so that

824
00:28:40,599 --> 00:28:43,798
I almost have to open yes I do smoke

825
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:45,399
flour still people don't believe that I

826
00:28:43,798 --> 00:28:46,879
still smoke weed I do it's not always

827
00:28:45,398 --> 00:28:48,158
dabs but I'll leave my weed a little

828
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,600
moist where I got to open the jar and

829
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:51,120
take the buds out and set them down for

830
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:53,240
10 or 20 minutes before I can actually

831
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:54,678
roll a joint with it and see yeah that's

832
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:56,759
just my personal if it's a production

833
00:28:54,679 --> 00:28:57,880
crop for my patients I'm a caregiver and

834
00:28:56,759 --> 00:29:00,240
the herb that's going to get delivered

835
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:02,159
to guy later on tonight uh that stuff's

836
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,000
dry it's been cured and it's dry it's

837
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:05,679
ready to go into his jar he'll keep uh

838
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,319
he's getting a half so it's probably

839
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:08,960
going to go in a mason jar it'll be

840
00:29:07,319 --> 00:29:10,639
sealed up and he'll just he'll probably

841
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,200
pull out a little baby food jar worth

842
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:14,000
for himself every couple of days when he

843
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:15,319
needs it and he hides the Mason jar away

844
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,880
from the family and has that in a safe

845
00:29:15,319 --> 00:29:19,798
place and keeps his jar in his pocket um

846
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:22,559
and that will also if your weed is

847
00:29:19,798 --> 00:29:24,519
really dry that may bring back some of

848
00:29:22,558 --> 00:29:26,158
the the moisture in the Christmas to

849
00:29:24,519 --> 00:29:27,558
good topic if your weed's really dry I

850
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:29,440
see a lot of people trying to put fruit

851
00:29:27,558 --> 00:29:32,119
and [ __ ] there don't do that you're

852
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,320
going to bring pathogens and molds uh it

853
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:34,798
doesn't take a lot of moisture to start

854
00:29:33,319 --> 00:29:36,839
molding up a jar if you leave it in

855
00:29:34,798 --> 00:29:38,278
there long enough uh this company does

856
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:41,798
not pay me [ __ ] but I do highly

857
00:29:38,278 --> 00:29:43,480
recommend a boova or a BEDA humida pack

858
00:29:41,798 --> 00:29:45,359
uh it's a great product uh if your

859
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:47,360
weed's a little bit too dry or a little

860
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:49,759
too moist even you put the proper Bova

861
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:52,158
humida pack in with your herbs and it

862
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:54,879
will properly uh moisten your herb to

863
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:57,480
the moisture content that is desired um

864
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,760
isn't it like 67 or whatever I don't

865
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:00,798
remember exactly it's one of those

866
00:29:58,759 --> 00:30:02,640
numbers I'll go to the B website right

867
00:30:00,798 --> 00:30:04,398
now and'll it's one of those numbers

868
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:07,278
I've seen it around

869
00:30:04,398 --> 00:30:10,319
um it's the humidity the perfect

870
00:30:07,278 --> 00:30:12,839
humidity should be around 67 or 76 it's

871
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:14,319
somewhere in between there I got it's

872
00:30:12,839 --> 00:30:16,319
like the same thing as a hum there's

873
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:18,720
also yeah well exactly there are

874
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:19,678
humidors for marijuana specifically I'm

875
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,839
not going to mention the name because I

876
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:24,640
don't want to give them a plug either

877
00:30:20,839 --> 00:30:26,759
but um they're they're shiny metal

878
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:28,880
they're cans they got a blocking seal to

879
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:30,640
them so it's and they come in all shapes

880
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:33,880
and sizes that's if you're you know the

881
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:35,960
High Roller you're the the pro uh I see

882
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:38,760
people use them to transport cannabis

883
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:40,720
for uh uh the Cannabis cups and stuff

884
00:30:38,759 --> 00:30:43,319
like that yeah they'll basically have

885
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:45,679
four or five of the big pound storage

886
00:30:43,319 --> 00:30:47,599
ones and there's three of them in a

887
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:50,720
backpack and they're loading getting on

888
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:52,480
an airplane wo you know and it's

889
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,759
completely you know No One Ever Knows

890
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:57,319
because it's completely sealed yeah you

891
00:30:54,759 --> 00:30:59,158
know still scary as [ __ ] that has your

892

894
00:31:00,679 --> 00:31:06,080
the

895
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:07,479
same um same humidity uh and I it

896
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:08,918
doesn't really uh tell you what it keeps

897
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:12,639
it at it says that it keeps it within a

898
00:31:08,919 --> 00:31:14,559
certain range of uh ambient humidity so

899
00:31:12,638 --> 00:31:16,079
yeah uh they have so many products out I

900
00:31:14,558 --> 00:31:17,720
didn't know they had so much stuff so

901
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:20,038

move along all right so if you're going

907
00:31:30,558 --> 00:31:34,638
to keep your weed longer than uh if

908
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:37,359
you've got some herb that is dried and

909
00:31:34,638 --> 00:31:38,759
cured and you know it's not moist enough

910
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:40,479
somebody hates the word moist a lot of

911
00:31:38,759 --> 00:31:41,679
people hate the word moist you know your

912
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,960
word your weed why would they hate the

913
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:45,278
word sounds sticky you know so if your

914
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,639
weed's not too damp and you're not

915
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:48,798
afraid to get mold in it you can put

916
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:51,119
your Herb in a vacuum sealer bag and

917
00:31:48,798 --> 00:31:52,679
vacuum seal that [ __ ] uh vacuum sealers

918
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:55,959
aren't too expensive the bags aren't too

919
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:57,480
expensive uh seal it up label it Mark it

920
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:59,679
uh some people DJ Short says to put it

921
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:01,079
in the free at this point that's what my

922
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:03,679
dad always did he put it in a brown

923
00:32:01,079 --> 00:32:05,079
paper bag and then stick it put it in a

924
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:06,600
bag put it in a brown paper bag and

925
00:32:05,079 --> 00:32:08,638
stick it in the freezer because that way

926
00:32:06,599 --> 00:32:09,638
none of the light would get into paper B

927
00:32:08,638 --> 00:32:11,240
so I was going to say that also keep

928
00:32:09,638 --> 00:32:12,519
your jars and stuff in a dark place when

929
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:13,880
you're not smoking them if you have the

930
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:15,759
opportunity or if you can get an opaque

931
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:17,360
jar to keep the lights out a large

932
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:19,398
quantity you know if it's if it's an

933
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:20,439
eighth or quarter you're good and yeah

934
00:32:19,398 --> 00:32:21,798
if you got if you got an ounce or

935
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:23,278
quarter pound keep that out of the out

936
00:32:21,798 --> 00:32:24,839
of the light you want that right on I

937
00:32:23,278 --> 00:32:26,278
feel really good about that question now

938
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:28,439
that took a lot longer than I was

939
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:31,319
thinking it would what about um

940
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:33,679
in jars if you keep stuff in jars for

941
00:32:31,319 --> 00:32:35,240
longer than I do obviously so would you

942
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:37,320
go in there once a month and kind of

943
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:38,319
dump it out and no once it's uh once I

944
00:32:37,319 --> 00:32:39,839
feel like we're going to do a whole

945
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:41,798
episode about drying and curing once

946
00:32:39,839 --> 00:32:42,959
that process is ended once drying and

947
00:32:41,798 --> 00:32:44,519
curing is done you can put it in your

948
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,759
jars and just leave it it's almost

949
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:47,759
better to leave it because every time

950
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:49,119
you open it you're introducing oxygen

951
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:51,158
and you're changing the gases that are

952
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:53,558
in the plants the plants are actually

953
00:32:51,159 --> 00:32:55,480
releasing ammonia and

954
00:32:53,558 --> 00:32:56,720
chlorophylls I I haven't studied for

955
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,720
this part so I'm going to say wrong [ __ ]

956
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,278
and a lot of people are going to correct

957
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:02,759
me

958
00:32:59,278 --> 00:33:05,319
gases and you're exchanging those gases

959
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:07,278
and if you quit introducing more gases

960
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:08,638
the decar oxolation and the changes will

961
00:33:07,278 --> 00:33:10,240
stop happening starches will quit

962
00:33:08,638 --> 00:33:11,558
becoming sugars everything will stay

963
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:14,278
right where it is all right it's like

964
00:33:11,558 --> 00:33:15,599
opening uh cool like uh opening a food

965
00:33:14,278 --> 00:33:17,278
product you get it just gets stale

966
00:33:15,599 --> 00:33:18,798
eventually because to change same thing

967
00:33:17,278 --> 00:33:20,558
will pretty much happen with your weed

968
00:33:18,798 --> 00:33:22,319
yeah I I've talked about this on the

969
00:33:20,558 --> 00:33:23,839
show before I like mine a little bit

970
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:26,599
drier because I put mine through a

971
00:33:23,839 --> 00:33:29,638
grinder and still get the KE off of the

972
00:33:26,599 --> 00:33:32,000
the bud onto the know my my grinder so I

973
00:33:29,638 --> 00:33:33,759
like it when I bring it home I I'll sit

974
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,839
it in the jar and just leave the the lid

975
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:38,240
half on half off for 12 hours and then

976
00:33:36,839 --> 00:33:40,038
put the jar you know the lid back on

977
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:42,480
it's still moist inside the butt a

978
00:33:40,038 --> 00:33:45,038
little bit but it's that outer stuff is

979
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:47,079
flakier and I get you know Dr I like it

980
00:33:45,038 --> 00:33:48,278
a little more a little more sticky you

981
00:33:47,079 --> 00:33:49,759
get a little more flavor out of it when

982
00:33:48,278 --> 00:33:51,440
it's a little stickier I think still you

983
00:33:49,759 --> 00:33:53,440
don't let it dry out so much and then

984
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:55,519
your joint Burns a little bit better

985
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:57,120
there you go I gr culture you got a

986
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:58,919
question answered Clint came over and

987
00:33:57,119 --> 00:34:01,079
asked a great freaking question after he

988
00:33:58,919 --> 00:34:03,880
got high that was nice yeah uh he also

989
00:34:01,079 --> 00:34:05,319
asked since he's a new smoker I did he

990
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:07,120
asked so I hope we wrap that up how to

991
00:34:05,319 --> 00:34:08,799
store your weed put it in a jar baggies

992
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:09,960
are cool but the baggie has uh static

993
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,919
electricity and it's stealing all your

994
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:14,119
[ __ ] and all your [ __ ] sticking to it so

995
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:15,638
keep it in a jar a nug jug of some sort

996
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:17,599
all right uh if you have to be sneaky

997
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:21,000
they spell skunk proof bags that are

998
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:23,280
smell proof they also at hyro peblo they

999
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,599
offer a duffel bag style bag and a

1000
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:27,440
backpack that they claim is smellproof I

1001
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:30,000
have not tested it by putting any

1002
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:31,398
product in it but they claim such and

1003
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
they're they're decently priced so if

1004
00:34:31,398 --> 00:34:34,799
they work that's worth it there's also

1005
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,639
stash cans and things like that that you

1006
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,839
can get you know of course you've seen

1007
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:40,200

1008
00:34:38,838 --> 00:34:42,279
more being secretive here yeah I'm not

1009

this you know time and time again

1054
00:36:26,199 --> 00:36:31,239

1055
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:33,760
rolling brother I've got a solution this

1056
00:36:31,239 --> 00:36:35,358
is the iy genetics only Surefire way

1057
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,599
that I think I know how to get past a

1058
00:36:35,358 --> 00:36:38,559
drug test that has worked for me

1059
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:42,160
multiple times when I was a heavy

1060
00:36:38,559 --> 00:36:44,480
smoker uh I actually went 63 days

1061
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:46,199
without smoking cannabis at one point

1062
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,960
and took a p test I was trying to get a

1063
00:36:46,199 --> 00:36:49,960
badass job I was promised to kill her

1064
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:51,800
job 63 days and could not pass I was

1065
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:54,800
still hot I was drinking cranberry juice

1066
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:56,240
I killing the water still had aot test

1067
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,640
my family was mad at me like you [ __ ]

1068
00:36:56,239 --> 00:36:59,039
it up you've been smoking pot and I was

1069
00:36:57,639 --> 00:37:00,559
like honestly I went to Reg on the rocks

1070
00:36:59,039 --> 00:37:02,639
and didn't smoke weed like I quit from

1071
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:04,838
the 4th of July I puffed down and then

1072
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:06,239
for 90 days after that or 63 days after

1073
00:37:04,838 --> 00:37:08,159
that I didn't smoke and still could not

1074
00:37:06,239 --> 00:37:09,919
get this job that I wanted and I told

1075
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:11,920
them I was like I haven't smoked in 65

1076
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,119
63 days and they're like sorry you still

1077
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,440
didn't I was like can you give me 30

1078
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:16,358
more days and they were already hiring

1079
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:18,358
for the position so it's was gone [ __ ]

1080
00:37:16,358 --> 00:37:21,598
but so the next time I needed to take a

1081
00:37:18,358 --> 00:37:25,279
p test I could not risk my PE even going

1082
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:28,359
in the cup honestly so your best bet is

1083
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:30,680
to use fake piss because they are not

1084
00:37:28,358 --> 00:37:33,559
checking for fake piss or piss they're

1085
00:37:30,679 --> 00:37:35,399
looking for THC Crystal math opiates

1086
00:37:33,559 --> 00:37:36,960
ecstasy whatever in our case hopefully

1087
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,880
guys if you're listening to my show

1088
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,679
hopefully the only thing they're going

1089
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:42,039
to find in your pee is some [ __ ]

1090
00:37:39,679 --> 00:37:45,639
medicine some cannabis but that's not my

1091
00:37:42,039 --> 00:37:47,279
spot to judge uh so they sell a product

1092
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:49,039
that is straight up fake piss it is

1093
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:50,440
designed to be fake piss it's usually at

1094
00:37:49,039 --> 00:37:51,759
some kind of a head shop around here

1095
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,880
there's a couple spots you can go you

1096
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:55,319
guys all know where they are if you live

1097
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:56,440
around here yeah yeah there's two spots

1098
00:37:55,318 --> 00:37:57,679
I don't endorse either one of them they

1099
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:59,240
got to work out a sponsorship if they

1100
00:37:57,679 --> 00:38:02,679
want me to say their names yeah start

1101
00:37:59,239 --> 00:38:04,838
paying us Mr money so you go there and

1102
00:38:02,679 --> 00:38:06,919
uh you get this fake pee and it's got a

1103
00:38:04,838 --> 00:38:08,838
thermometer on the side of the container

1104
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:12,119
the bottle has a thermometer on it it

1105
00:38:08,838 --> 00:38:13,719
should come with a it's a glove warmer

1106
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:14,960
for the winter you crack the thing open

1107
00:38:13,719 --> 00:38:16,159
and you put your glove you put it in

1108
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,079
your gloves and it warms your hands in

1109
00:38:16,159 --> 00:38:21,239
the winter it comes with one of those if

1110
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:23,519
it doesn't you got to go buy one so what

1111
00:38:21,239 --> 00:38:25,598
I do this is how I sure fire past more

1112
00:38:23,519 --> 00:38:27,639
than one drug test I get this product

1113
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:29,119
and I microwaved it for 7 seconds and my

1114
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:32,480
microwave and that made it a little too

1115
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:34,559
hot so I took a sock and I cut the sock

1116
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:36,119
off and I stapled it to the inside of my

1117
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:39,078

1167
00:40:05,079 --> 00:40:08,400
temperature if you got that glove

1169
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,440
rubber band around it put it between

00:40:09,719 --> 00:40:13,159
your legs and squeeze when you feel your

1171

legs getting too warm that shit's

1172
00:40:13,159 --> 00:40:17,279
probably right at the right temperature

1173
00:40:14,838 --> 00:40:18,679
H yeah so and you got that little bottle

1174
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:21,000
it's tucked inside of a sock it's

1175
00:40:18,679 --> 00:40:22,118
strapped inside your boxers girls you're

1176
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,800
going to have to modify I don't know

1177
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:23,960
what you're going to do you're going to

1178
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,440
look like you got a dick if you follow

1179
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:29,760
my method maybe it'll help you out don't

1180
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:31,599
wear a skirt or or or do or do so uh

1181
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,800
pull out this little bottle and just

1182
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:33,760
stick it out of the pee hole of your fly

1183
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,880
and stick your hand in there and stick

1184
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,040
your thumb out so it's like your dick

1185
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,920
because if they're standing behind you

1186
00:40:36,039 --> 00:40:38,599
or something you're going to have to be

1187
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:41,440
smooth stick your thumb out make that

1188
00:40:38,599 --> 00:40:42,880
look like your dong fart uh always fart

1189
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:46,838
during a p test if someone's watching

1190
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:48,240
that's just mandatory fart do that so uh

1191
00:40:46,838 --> 00:40:50,119
I squeezed the bottle the first time I

1192
00:40:48,239 --> 00:40:52,399
did it into the little sample cup and it

1193
00:40:50,119 --> 00:40:54,559
went when I let go of it cuz it tried to

1194
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:56,000
suck in more air so tip it up so that

1195
00:40:54,559 --> 00:40:58,078
you don't make a bong sound when you're

1196
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,880
[ __ ] doing that or fart right at that

1197
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:02,280
point if you can time it you got to be

1198
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:03,838
careful so and then stick that thing

1199
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:05,760
close it back up screw the cap on stick

1200
00:41:03,838 --> 00:41:06,960
it back in your underwear [ __ ] don't

1201
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,040
wash your hands leave the cup there like

1202
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,400
you're supposed to and hope that you

1203
00:41:08,039 --> 00:41:10,960
just put enough of the right temperature

1204
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:13,119
fake piss in there so that fake piss

1205
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:15,760
worked for me more than once right on

1206
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:17,440
yeah fake piss don't trust my friend I

1207
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:19,040
won't say his name he had his girlfriend

1208
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:21,440
pee in the cup and that's how they found

1209
00:41:19,039 --> 00:41:24,559
out that my buddy was pregnant M yeah

1210
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:25,880

1211
00:41:24,559 --> 00:41:28,318
piss

1212
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:29,760
but I have

1213
00:41:28,318 --> 00:41:32,800
I've never used my own

1214
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:34,440

1215
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:36,039
want to ask any questions yeah so we're

1216
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:37,960
not trying to mask it we're trying to

1217
00:41:36,039 --> 00:41:39,000
replace it yeah cuz they're not looking

1218
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,639
yeah there's plenty of things you can

1219
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
drink eat or whatever to take and all

1220
00:41:40,639 --> 00:41:43,440
they've done is upset my stomach and

1221
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,079
give me diarrhea and by the time you get

1222
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,720
to the lab you got a pee so bad that

1223
00:41:45,079 --> 00:41:49,880
your pee is clear and they go oh this is

1224
00:41:46,719 --> 00:41:51,959
diluted we can't even test it yeah yeah

1225
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:54,880
yeah yep so if it comes through you and

1226
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:57,400
if you smoke like Adam and I do uh I dab

1227
00:41:54,880 --> 00:42:00,280
at least a half a gram a day a day could

1228
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:04,559
honestly probably quit for 15 days and

1229
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:06,599
you would maybe fine but don't you know

1230
00:42:04,559 --> 00:42:08,679
it's technically 30 days the thing is is

1231
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:10,280
I don't want to quit smoking weed though

1232
00:42:08,679 --> 00:42:12,960
and I'm and it's just a random that's

1233
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:14,680
going to come up you know and so I don't

1234
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:16,358
want to quit if I wanted to quit I

1235
00:42:14,679 --> 00:42:17,759
wouldn't have started then you should

1236
00:42:16,358 --> 00:42:19,719
you should definitely get prepared I

1237
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:21,359
mean that's that's one of the best best

1238
00:42:19,719 --> 00:42:23,480
options that I've heard and then I would

1239
00:42:21,358 --> 00:42:25,039
just keep hand warmers on the ready like

1240
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:29,559
I'd start wearing shirts with pockets

1241
00:42:25,039 --> 00:42:31,558
and like you know don't touch me you

1242
00:42:29,559 --> 00:42:33,720
know one day you're standing there

1243
00:42:31,559 --> 00:42:37,160
talking to your boss there's just this

1244
00:42:33,719 --> 00:42:38,078
big are you my pocket protector is not

1245
00:42:37,159 --> 00:42:41,519

1248
00:42:43,199 --> 00:42:46,759
joke there oh there's definitely a joke

1249
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:48,400

all right good don't take my jokes

1251
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,280
because I wouldn't tell it anyways I

1252
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:54,599
like your jokes that's why I'm not going

1253
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:56,319
to use them anyways we've gone uh 40

1254
00:42:54,599 --> 00:42:58,359
minutes 41 minutes you guys want to uh

1255
00:42:56,318 --> 00:42:59,599
you want to do one more question you one

1256
00:42:58,358 --> 00:43:01,078
more question I got one more but I bet

1257
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:03,079
we could go on for quite a while about

1258
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:05,400
it if we do it it'll kind of make it a

1259
00:43:03,079 --> 00:43:08,839
long question I want to know what it's

1260
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:10,760
about well the question was what kind of

1261
00:43:08,838 --> 00:43:12,799
lights are you using for each phase of

1262
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:15,400
growing all right that could be really

1263
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:18,240
long or it could be really simple yeah

1264
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:20,280
so quick rundown I've I've been oh guys

1265
00:43:18,239 --> 00:43:21,479
I know but I know I started off doing a

1266
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:23,000
bunch of grow lessons and we got

1267
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:25,280
sidetracked because Jesse came over and

1268
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,559
started doing outdoor grow stuff uh we

1269
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,800
started talking about all kinds of other

1270
00:43:26,559 --> 00:43:29,040
stuff we kind of lost track of the grow

1271
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:30,480
lessons I promise to get you caught up

1272
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:31,880
on those there's just so much [ __ ] going

1273
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:34,079
on that it's hard to even catch up we

1274
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:36,000
get sidetracked just stay tuned it's a

1275
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:37,680
busy season it's such a great year to do

1276
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,559
a podcast there's been so much cannabis

1277
00:43:37,679 --> 00:43:41,558
news and stuff to talk about that's true

1278
00:43:39,559 --> 00:43:42,640
it is a busy season yeah uh Jesse will

1279
00:43:41,559 --> 00:43:46,160
be here in a couple of days and we're

1280
00:43:42,639 --> 00:43:47,799
going to work on finishing up the uh uh

1281
00:43:46,159 --> 00:43:49,199
drying and curing episode so that'll

1282
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:51,200
definitely be fun but what kind of

1283
00:43:49,199 --> 00:43:53,358
Lights do I use that's where I was uh

1284
00:43:51,199 --> 00:43:56,358
for seedlings and stuff that's just

1285
00:43:53,358 --> 00:43:58,960
starting simple t5s are fine um a lot of

1286
00:43:56,358 --> 00:44:01,000
guys correct yeah yeah fluoresence T5

1287
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:02,720
fluoresence uh t5s are the little skinny

1288
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,199
bulbs so they name them t5s are the

1289
00:44:02,719 --> 00:44:06,118
skinny ones and t8s are the bigger ones

1290
00:44:04,199 --> 00:44:07,719
it's just what size they are uh so I

1291
00:44:06,119 --> 00:44:10,960
keep my seedlings and my clones under

1292
00:44:07,719 --> 00:44:12,199
t5s until they're good and rooted um

1293
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,358
depending on which room they're going

1294
00:44:12,199 --> 00:44:14,919
and what I'm trying to do with them

1295
00:44:13,358 --> 00:44:16,519
sometimes they'll stay under t5s until

1296
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:18,639
flower if I'm just doing a three gallon

1297
00:44:16,519 --> 00:44:20,358
pot of a little plant and the reason why

1298
00:44:18,639 --> 00:44:22,199
you run t5s is not only because of the

1299
00:44:20,358 --> 00:44:23,719
heat but because it's it you can get

1300
00:44:22,199 --> 00:44:25,039
them closer to the plant right you can

1301
00:44:23,719 --> 00:44:26,838
put them right on the plant and they're

1302
00:44:25,039 --> 00:44:28,000
more energy efficient uh than a big

1303
00:44:26,838 --> 00:44:29,358
light and I don't think that the plant

1304
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,760
really needs a th000 watt light when

1305
00:44:29,358 --> 00:44:32,480
it's a baby you could just give it

1306
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:33,800
enough just and that spectrum they sell

1307
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:35,838
two different color bulbs if you get the

1308
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:38,000
blue ones uh those keep your plant short

1309
00:44:35,838 --> 00:44:39,799
and squat uh and that's what we want for

1310
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,039
veg and until your plants are 2 and a

1311
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:42,240
half three feet tall that's plenty of

1312
00:44:41,039 --> 00:44:43,440
light don't keep them too crowded in

1313
00:44:42,239 --> 00:44:46,479
there give them plenty of space with the

1314
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:48,599
t5s but yeah it's definitely helpful

1315
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:50,880
I've seen people flower with t5s I have

1316
00:44:48,599 --> 00:44:52,280
too uh it's not impressive but if you're

1317
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:53,519
in Tennessee where you're not supposed

1318
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:54,760
to be growing weed and you can't get a

1319
00:44:53,519 --> 00:44:56,318
big light build that's going to be

1320
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:58,079
better than buying weed off of some food

1321
00:44:56,318 --> 00:45:00,759
on the street I've seen some people grow

1322
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:03,400
some pretty dank stuff you know with it

1323
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:05,160
um so to start I like the the t5s uh

1324
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:07,639
once they get a little bit larger I will

1325
00:45:05,159 --> 00:45:10,199
throw them under uh I go straight to the

1326
00:45:07,639 --> 00:45:11,920
thousand watt metal Halli for vegging uh

1327
00:45:10,199 --> 00:45:13,279
I've got a nice veg room with thousand

1328
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:16,318
watt metal halides in there keep them

1329
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:18,040
kind of close to the plants uh the hux

1330
00:45:16,318 --> 00:45:19,599
uh I think it's the blue I forget which

1331
00:45:18,039 --> 00:45:21,318
one they make for it's the hux lights

1332
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:24,039
they make for vegging the blue one

1333
00:45:21,318 --> 00:45:26,279
that's awesome for vegging uh hux makes

1334
00:45:24,039 --> 00:45:27,719
a high press sodium that is red uh

1335
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:29,400
that's super awesome for flowering I

1336
00:45:27,719 --> 00:45:31,838
like to switch to that now with your

1337
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:35,119
when you step from the t5s to the bigger

1338
00:45:31,838 --> 00:45:36,838
lights uh how just give us a range on

1339
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:39,838
like how far you want to keep them you

1340
00:45:36,838 --> 00:45:43,239
know I as far as close as you can get

1341
00:45:39,838 --> 00:45:44,078
them within uh you don't want them you

1342
00:45:43,239 --> 00:45:45,239
don't you kind of want to get them as

1343
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:48,079
close as you can without burning the

1344
00:45:45,239 --> 00:45:51,118
plants but there is a range around 1,000

1345
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:52,880
watt light bulb that is unusable light

1346
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:54,318
for the plant it's just too intense and

1347
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:56,039
it's the wrong Spectrum so you have to

1348
00:45:54,318 --> 00:45:58,000
back up about a foot and a half 2 feet

1349
00:45:56,039 --> 00:46:00,800
from the bulb okay is probably your best

1350
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,199
bet right but only the tops of your

1351
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,720
plants are up there so the bottoms of

1352
00:46:02,199 --> 00:46:05,039
your plants you gota there's a lot of

1353
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:06,919
factors to keep in there but about a

1354
00:46:05,039 --> 00:46:08,318
foot 18 inches to a foot is probably

1355
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:10,240
about as close as you really want to get

1356
00:46:08,318 --> 00:46:11,519
unless you've got some amazing cooling

1357
00:46:10,239 --> 00:46:13,000
you know if you've got really well

1358
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:16,838
ducted and ventilated lights then you

1359
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:18,440
can get them 10 8 in but sometimes that

1360
00:46:16,838 --> 00:46:20,558
that burst of light coming right out of

1361
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:22,480
there isn't what the plants really want

1362
00:46:20,559 --> 00:46:24,280
that will kind of stress the plants and

1363
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:26,199
change the flavors and kind of do a few

1364
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:27,640
things that if you want a certain effect

1365
00:46:26,199 --> 00:46:29,679
that's how I achieve one effect when I'm

1366
00:46:27,639 --> 00:46:31,719
trying to do something is light stress

1367
00:46:29,679 --> 00:46:33,279
the plan a little bit but I don't want

1368
00:46:31,719 --> 00:46:37,118
to tell too much about that so I'm

1369
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:38,559
vegging under the t5s I'm moving to the

1370
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:40,838
uh metal halides and then I go to high

1371
00:46:38,559 --> 00:46:42,480
pressure sodiums to finish a long time

1372
00:46:40,838 --> 00:46:44,078
ago I tried an experiment using high

1373
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:46,159
pressure sodiums and metal halides and I

1374
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:49,039
honestly get the best flavors using a

1375
00:46:46,159 --> 00:46:50,759
mixture um the different spectrums yeah

1376
00:46:49,039 --> 00:46:53,440
yeah using like the blue and the red I

1377
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:55,280
got four uh High Press sodiums with a

1378
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:56,639
with a one metal H right in the middle

1379
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:58,079
of the room and all the plants in the

1380
00:46:56,639 --> 00:47:00,358
middle the room were a little more dense

1381
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:02,318
had a little more flavor uh I learned

1382
00:47:00,358 --> 00:47:04,078
that by running uh the old reflector

1383
00:47:02,318 --> 00:47:06,519
called the Grilla it holds two bulbs I

1384
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:08,280
put a 600 uh sodium and a 400 highight

1385
00:47:06,519 --> 00:47:09,920
in there and everything in that little

1386
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:11,920
tester Hut came out dank some of the

1387
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:13,079
pictures of headband on my Facebook are

1388
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:14,960
actually from that Hut and it was

1389
00:47:13,079 --> 00:47:17,240
amazing yeah I've seen those pictures of

1390
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:20,000
man super dank is that his headband

1391
00:47:17,239 --> 00:47:22,239
yours I did not make it no okay sorry

1392
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:25,159
trying to plug your [ __ ] well nice try

1393
00:47:22,239 --> 00:47:26,959
uh uh actually I got to talk to Dr dank

1394
00:47:25,159 --> 00:47:28,598
today or Mr dank today the creator of

1395
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:30,000
the Golden Goat o we had a little

1396
00:47:28,599 --> 00:47:31,880
conversation on Facebook that was kind

1397
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,039
of nice CU I did not create Golden Goat

1398
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:34,720
a lot of people try to give me credit

1399
00:47:33,039 --> 00:47:37,079
for that Mr dank created Golden Goat I

1400
00:47:34,719 --> 00:47:38,679
simply put it into seed I femin I

1401
00:47:37,079 --> 00:47:40,920
reversed a female made a male out of it

1402
00:47:38,679 --> 00:47:42,799
and put the pollen on another female

1403
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:44,920
made seeds out of it yes so it's a it's

1404
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:46,400
a dank cut so I made seeds out of the

1405
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:47,838
Golden Goat if you guys want to give

1406
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:50,920
credit to the guy that made it thank Mr

1407
00:47:47,838 --> 00:47:52,000
dank he did that not me uh thanks Mr

1408
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:53,480
dank for letting me use it he actually

1409
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,480
gave me permission to put it into seed

1410
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:57,000
and he said all he wants seed though

1411
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:58,559
yeah yeah there you go I thought

1412
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:01,639
everybody deserved good genetics that's

1413
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:04,280
part of why I started making seeds so uh

1414
00:48:01,639 --> 00:48:07,318
I usually do fluorescent Halid sodiums a

1415
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:09,559
lot of people will ask about LEDs I used

1416
00:48:07,318 --> 00:48:12,960
to knock an LED light but my friend

1417
00:48:09,559 --> 00:48:15,800
Nancy kills it she is killing it with

1418
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:18,480
Bounty Killer yeah she's running ceton

1419
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:20,720
too and they both look Frosty and dank

1420
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:22,280
and all pretty much all of her stuff is

1421
00:48:20,719 --> 00:48:23,919
on I was just about to say she's running

1422
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:26,519
a lot of stuff that's from other Growers

1423
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:27,559
not even me that looks amazing just as

1424
00:48:26,519 --> 00:48:29,800
well

1425
00:48:27,559 --> 00:48:32,240
uh what's the one that she's got is it

1426
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:34,800
DB Cooper that's just giant nugs it

1427
00:48:32,239 --> 00:48:37,118
looks really nice yeah yeah n's doing a

1428
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:39,559
great job with the grows shout out Nancy

1429
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:41,519
bwell talking about women Growers you

1430
00:48:39,559 --> 00:48:42,720
know I mean always get her to write

1431
00:48:41,519 --> 00:48:44,599
something a little yeah I'm going to

1432
00:48:42,719 --> 00:48:46,919
make a not prob she's probably a well

1433
00:48:44,599 --> 00:48:48,280
spoken individual that could probably

1434
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:50,639
you know put a paragraph in that you

1435
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:52,400
could read yeah there we go support

1436
00:48:50,639 --> 00:48:54,318
those women Growers I don't care what

1437
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:55,920
Clint says hey I was just making a joke

1438
00:48:54,318 --> 00:48:57,960
no I like it I like that you got to have

1439
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:59,880
an approach as a ComEd and one time

1440
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:01,119
Clint told me go on the chauvinist route

1441
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:04,160
and I believed

1442
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:06,039
him I got a little misogynistic yeah

1443
00:49:04,159 --> 00:49:08,519
there was no uh no denying that you were

1444
00:49:06,039 --> 00:49:10,759
good at it oh it's it's the it's really

1445
00:49:08,519 --> 00:49:12,599
easy and that's why I don't like it yeah

1446
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:14,760
is because it's for me it's easy to

1447
00:49:12,599 --> 00:49:17,559
write those jokes

1448
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:18,480
yeah fun it's just not fun it's just an

1449

easy

1450
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:23,559

1474
00:50:11,639 --> 00:50:15,960
like a professional comedian coming to

00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:17,639
peblo like it's not like oh it's unheard

1476
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:19,039
of but it's like you guys are going to

1477
00:50:17,639 --> 00:50:20,798
miss it and I don't want anybody to miss

1478
00:50:19,039 --> 00:50:21,960
it like oh I didn't even hear about that

1479
00:50:20,798 --> 00:50:24,159
you know what I heard like one of my

1480
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:27,400
favorite bands baroness have you ever

1481
00:50:24,159 --> 00:50:29,480
heard they're like a metal band um

1482
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:31,519
one of my favorite bands and my buddy

1483
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:34,159
Paul who does comedy with me told me

1484
00:50:31,519 --> 00:50:36,280
yeah we had them back in like 2000 come

1485
00:50:34,159 --> 00:50:38,798

metal and they're just like I missed it

1488
00:50:41,559 --> 00:50:44,839
and that's that's why you miss it though

1489
00:50:43,079 --> 00:50:46,599
is because you don't know it's happening

1490
00:50:44,838 --> 00:50:47,960
and there's not enough to do in P where

1491

down there every day it seems like

1496
00:50:55,559 --> 00:50:58,440
though you know it's hard to just

00:50:56,599 --> 00:50:59,960
