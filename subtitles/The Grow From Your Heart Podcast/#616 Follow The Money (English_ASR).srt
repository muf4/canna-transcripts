put on some headphones turn on a

144
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,878
microphone and hang out with my friends

and take some dabs in there

146
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:14,399
during these quarantine times during

147
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:16,079
these lockdown times if you're listening

148
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,840
in the future right now we're still in

149
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,120
sort of a quarantine situation we're not

150
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,159
allowed to play with our friends as much

151
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,000
as we'd like

152
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,520
during these sort of times uh it's

153
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,439
really nice to have something like a

154
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:27,120
zoom chat like the discord chat

155
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:29,839
things like that to be interactive with

156
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,120
more uh fellow smokers growers stoners

157
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:32,719
like-minded friends

158
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,639
and it's also a beautiful way for me to

159
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,000
keep in touch with the ire army with the

160
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,639
crew the people that are growing my

161
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,720
strains

162
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,319

00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,080

165
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:45,758
back you guys get to ask me questions

166
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:47,199
it's funny because sometimes people come

167
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,560
in they're a little bit i hate to say

168
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,840
the word star struck but they've been

00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,280
relying on your garden for several

261
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,720
things maybe it's medicine

262
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:22,318
maybe it's how you're paying the bills

263
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,440
maybe it's a little bit of both maybe

your financial survival when you flip it

smoke it you use that flip to cover the

270

have time to hang out in that discord

393
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:10,399
chat at like four in the morning so

394
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:11,679
it's a huge community and i'm

395
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,399
overwhelmed if you can't tell i've been

396
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:13,679
gushing for

397
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,399
several minutes about this but i

398
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:18,719
appreciate it here's the morbid thought

399
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,240
that i had

400
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,000
excuse that throat clearing i did take

401
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,399
some gnarly dabs a minute ago

402
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,759
ah the morbid thought that i had was i

403
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,078
could pass away

404
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:29,200
now this moment as long as this episode

405
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:30,000
makes it out and you guys get my

406
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,879
gratitude

407
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,320
i could pass away right now and this

408
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:36,480
company this podcast

409
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,920
this idea that i created will still

410
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,720
thrive for

411
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:42,078
at least a decade to come until youtube

412
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,920
deletes my episodes

413
00:11:42,078 --> 00:11:45,519
they'll stay up there uh we've got a

414
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:46,799
friend subcool who passed away like a

415
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,879
year ago

416
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:51,919
rest in peace and shout out to subcool i

417
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:53,600
still watch his videos

418
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:55,278
so with that i'm still keeping subby

419
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,200
alive you guys will continue to watch my

420
00:11:55,278 --> 00:12:00,240
videos for a year i'm sure that

421
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,920
also i'm still growing sub cool seeds

422
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,360
so that tells me that when i'm gone

423
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:04,639
hopefully somebody out there is still

424
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,200
growing my seeds

425
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:09,039
for generations then maybe somebody will

426
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,639
breed with them just like i did for sub

427
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:12,480
sub's gone i took some of his stuff i

428
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,320
bred it to keep subby alive

429
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,800
the man may be gone but his work his

430
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,079
legend his idea his vibe will continue

431
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:20,000
as partly my uh

432
00:12:18,078 --> 00:12:22,000
it's partly my job i felt to continue

433
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,039
that so somebody in the ivory army i

434
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,639
have a good feeling of

435
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:26,159
who a few of those people may be some of

436
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,200
them i don't even know i'm sure there

437
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:29,039
are people out there

438
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,639
kicking ass with my genetics doing work

439
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:32,000
for me that i don't even know yet

440
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,079
shout out thank you but there are a few

441
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,600
people i have in mind that i know if i

442
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:37,519
were to pass right now

443
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,200
some of those people would continue the

444
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,959
ire work my strains would be

445
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,040
crossed to other things and crossed with

446
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:43,759
themselves i know people would continue

447
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:46,000
the vibe

448
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:47,919
the website would be continued to

449
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,879
survive for quite a while it comes from

450
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:50,958
a bank account

451
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:52,000
until that bank account is drained the

452
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:54,638
website would exist

453
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
so if i passed away at this moment after

454
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:57,278
i put out this podcast we'll say just

455
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,919
after i hit post you guys get to hear

456
00:12:57,278 --> 00:13:00,639

457
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:02,719
uh this company iriegenetics this

458
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:04,079
podcast the grow from your heart podcast

459
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,639
will survive

460
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:08,239
indefinitely uh possibly infinitely as

461
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:10,480
long as youtube goes on

462
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,839
this exists which is [ __ ] cool as

463
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,200
long as you guys are growing and

464
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:14,000
breeding and taking care of the clones

465
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,399
and seeds

466
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,679
the vibe the idea that i created now at

467
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,440
this point will last

468
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:21,359
almost indefinitely and that's [ __ ]

469
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,800
beautiful keep it going you guys

470
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,720

474
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,159
podcast

475
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,480
the slogan behind irie genetics used to

476
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:34,480
be

477
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,560
grow from your heart and breed with love

478
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,480
uh we kind of separated the two entities

479
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:40,000
to have two different llc's here but

480
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,600
grow from your heart man that's always

481
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,078
what it's been about so

482
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,120

keep growing from your heart you guys

484
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,679
and it'll keep going so i'm spreading

485
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,160
that love spreading that vibe is my

486
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:49,838
point

487
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:51,278

00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:19,679
owned by hawthorne or plan on doing

503
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,799
that episode maybe some people are going

504
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:22,159
that's random why do we care about

505
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:24,078
what's owned by hawthorne

506
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:26,000
that's a really good question i'm not

507
00:14:24,078 --> 00:14:27,919
going to do a specific episode on

508
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,639
companies which are owned by hawthorne

509
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:33,599
but this will set me up for a good rant

510
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:35,839
which goes a lot like this i'm not going

511
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,879
to bash or roast any certain brands or

512
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:38,880
companies

513
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:40,639
we know who we shouldn't support we know

514
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:42,559
most of us know who we should not be

515
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:45,039
supporting who the big devils are

516
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:45,759
in agriculture and commercial in the

517
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:48,879
world

518
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:50,240
uh in capitalism in just politics and

519
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:52,159
[ __ ] economics

520
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,919
we kind of know who we should be voting

521
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:56,480
who we should be avoiding

522
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:58,159
uh i'm kind of an older guy by now i'm

523
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,759
42 years old i've got a good idea of

524
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:01,278
where my money should go and

525
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:03,120
who's getting my money and who makes

526
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:05,039
what and who runs what at this point

527
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,959
so maybe some of you guys haven't put

528
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:07,838
too much thought about where the money

529
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:10,879
goes

530
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:13,120
so um here's the thing to think about

531
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:14,879
this guy is saying uh have why done a

532
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,360
show about hawthorne hawthorne is kind

533
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:17,519
of

534
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,360
a big company that owns a lot of things

535
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,799
they may not have the best values they

536
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,639
may not have the best uh

537
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:24,159
views on keeping the world safe and

538
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,240
healthy they may not be the best at

539
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:28,240
keeping humans safe and healthy they may

540
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,560
be focused more on the dollars

541
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,079
than the long-term effects of human

542
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:33,359
safety environmental safety and

543
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:36,239
environmental impact

544
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:38,000
so we're going to do a little talk about

545
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,399
avoiding those types of companies

546
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,720
and basically scotty real puts it best

547
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,198
scotty real says vote with your dollars

548
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,560
man

549
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:46,719
so we're going to talk about voting with

550
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:48,000
our dollars uh the word i wrote was

551
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,680
conscious spending

552
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,919
another thing i wrote on my flow chart

553
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:54,399
here was follow the money man

554
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:56,319
so when you're shopping for uh i'm gonna

555
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:59,519
focus this on grow supplies

556
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:01,680
nutrients soil soilless mix uh we'll go

557
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,120
as far as saying lights and equipment

558
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:04,879
anything in your grow but this could

559
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,560
apply to anything

560
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:08,399
in your life wherever you're spending

561
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:10,078
money time energy

562
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,919
is it worth it is it somewhere you want

563
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:14,799
to spend your hard-earned

564
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:16,078
money time energy money's expensive man

565
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:17,359
you work hard for it

566
00:16:16,078 --> 00:16:19,439
you've got to do something you don't

567
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,278
want to do for a certain amount of time

568
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,959
probably unless you're blessed and have

569
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:24,559
it really lucky you're probably working

570
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:26,159
for somebody you don't like who doesn't

571
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:27,679
appreciate you that doesn't see how hard

572
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:28,958
you work that doesn't understand how

573
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:31,359
hard your struggle is

574
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:32,799
and it sucks so money's expensive

575
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,360
putting in your time and energy to get

576
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:35,120
money

577
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,800
that is expensive so follow the money

578
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,759
when you're spending it do you want to

579
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:39,838
spend that money

580
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:41,199
if you know that when you buy a product

581
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,720
you may have two options

582
00:16:41,198 --> 00:16:45,278
does the company that you buy a product

583
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:48,560
from does company a use that money to

584
00:16:45,278 --> 00:16:50,000
uh reforest the rain forest or some [ __ ]

585
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:52,319
and does the other company use that

586
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,559
money to shoot babies

587
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,759
uh on sundays who are you spending your

588
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:57,599
money with we already know we're gonna

589
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,560
save the rainforest not shoot babies on

590
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,720
sunday right

591
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:02,399
so that's an easy way to decide how to

592
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,000
spend your money do a little research on

593
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,599
where the money goes once you spend

594
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,519
it what are you going to do with it bro

595
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:09,119
are you going to support a presidential

596
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:10,160
candidate that we are not up for are you

597
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,798
going to support a presidential

598
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,959
candidate

599
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:14,720
that is on cannabis side because why are

600
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,798
you going to spend your money

601
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,959
with a company who is against the thing

602
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:21,119
that you're buying their product to do

603
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,798
so i don't want to be political but also

604
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:24,318
kind of it's not just political this is

605
00:17:22,798 --> 00:17:26,639
a personal thing this is

606
00:17:24,318 --> 00:17:28,240
uh this is a personal decision this is

607
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,440
some things a conscious decision we need

608
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,279
to start making

609
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,679
uh maybe some people aren't aware of

610
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:35,839
that does your contribution go to a good

611
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:38,720
cause or does your contribution go

612
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:40,558
to more research to create more products

613
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,000
that are not going to be desirable for

614
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:43,759
our planet our world

615
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,359
i'm trying not to bash too many specific

616
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:47,200
companies say too many names

617
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:48,719
we all know that monsanto is the devil

618
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,640
that scots is the devil

619
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,558
anybody that falls in that umbrella we

620
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:55,360
may not want to give them our money

621
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:55,918
if you've got the option to give your

622
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:59,199
money

623
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:00,960
to a mom and pop shop at bro and chick

624
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,200
owned shop in your neighborhood

625
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,000
maybe some uh lady that's been in the

626
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,319
grow community

627
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,240
opened up a new hydro store go shop

628
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:10,319
there avoid that big box shop

629
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,000
if you can i understand that some people

630
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:13,678
some places some locations

631
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,279
the only thing you've got is that big

632
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,640
chain store you have to go to lowe's you

633
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:18,160
may have to go to home depot you may

634
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,480
have to hit the walmart

635
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:22,320
but if there's a small shop that is

636
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,599
available it may be a dollar or two more

637
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:25,839
to shop there but

638
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:27,439
it's worth your time effort and energy

639
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:30,159
to support that family

640
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,679
when you buy something from bill's

641
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,480
garden supply store

642

bill gets to buy himself a truck and

643
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,919

644
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:41,119

00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,960
they carry that place might not be there

669
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:24,720
if you go to walmart if you go to home

670
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,480
depot if you go to lowe's and you've got

671
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:29,440
a couple of questions hey bill

672
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:31,200
what's the best way to do this maybe you

673
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,960
get somebody at home depot or lowe's

674
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,640
that's slightly competent

675
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,960
competent that might be the word i tried

676
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,000
to say but if you go talk to bill at

677
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,679
bill's hardware

678
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,440
bill will have six or seven different

679
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,960
ideas on how to do it he'll find out

680
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,480
which is the best idea for you he'll

681
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,759
walk you up and down the aisles

682
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,440
build you a little shopping cart or the

683
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:48,879
[ __ ] that's gonna work best for you

684
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,080
shake your hand and wish you the best

685
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,520
and send you on your way

686
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:52,879
when you come back in two or three days

687
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:54,319
with pictures of the job on your phone

688
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,360
bill's gonna high-five you

689
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:57,359
you guys are gonna be friends you're

690
00:19:55,359 --> 00:19:58,879
gonna be part of the community not just

691
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:00,639
walking into a big box

692
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,000
being another zombie with a credit card

693
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,759
leaving with a bunch of plastic

694
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
[ __ ] going home and hoping you've got

695
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:08,558
what you've got and giving our money to

696
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,640
the waltons and china so that was kind

697
00:20:08,558 --> 00:20:11,200
of a weird long rant for a podcast about

698
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,200
cannabis

699
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,720
but let's follow the money when we're

700
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,640
shopping let's

701
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:19,200
follow the money conscious spending

702
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:21,120
conscious shopping conscious consuming

703
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,880
uh vote with your dollars man that's

704
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:25,599
basically what i'm trying to say

705
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,559
so when you're gonna buy a product if

706
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:29,519
you can

707
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:31,279
buy a locally sourced product if you can

708
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:32,400
i understand that not everything is made

709
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:34,639
everywhere

710
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:37,519
buy something local if it's not made

711
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:40,000
local buy it from a store that is local

712
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:40,879
and if not then think about where is the

713
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,720
money going

714
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,919
once i buy this hopefully it goes to a

715
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,000
local grow store

716
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:47,280
so that bill's gross store gets to pay

717
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,880
their bills they get to pay the light

718
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:50,558
bill they get to pay the rent then bill

719
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,280
gets to pay his mortgage and buy some

720
00:20:50,558 --> 00:20:52,879
groceries

721
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:54,480
take care of the family that's always a

722
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,480
feel-good feeling right

723
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,798
then hopefully that money is going to a

724
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:01,519
company that is making a quality product

725
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:02,639
and not using a bunch of crappy uh

726
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:04,639
imported or

727
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,159
half-assed ingredients hopefully we're

728
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,679
trying to keep our money close to home

729
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:09,760
with people that we care about

730
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:12,080
instead of just watching it go blindly

731
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:13,279
just causes which we do not support

732
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:15,359
all right i feel like i've spent enough

733
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:17,359
time on that message uh

734
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:19,599
let's see do you want your name shouted

735
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:20,879
out i don't see your name on here at all

736
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:22,798
so i'm not going to give you

737
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,559
an uh shout out by name but you know who

738
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:25,279

739
00:21:24,558 --> 00:21:28,240
and thank you

740
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:31,519
for sparking a great line of ranting on

741
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,960
this episode of the podcast

742
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:35,200
all right this next message came from

743
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:37,159
the grow help tab on my website that's

744
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,519
right if you go to the website

745
00:21:37,159 --> 00:21:41,280
iriegenetics.com on the top bar there is

746
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:43,279
a grow help tab click on that

747
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:44,879
you will be able to ask a grow question

748
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:47,038
and ask for grow advice

749
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,880
we do ask a few preliminary questions

750
00:21:47,038 --> 00:21:50,079
before we get there we ask your name

751
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,080
what strain you're growing if you're

752
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:53,439
growing indoors or outdoors you will see

753
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:54,639
the questionnaire if you do go to the

754
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,240
website and jump on that

755
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,440
grow help tab just click on that it'll

756
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,558
get you right to it then you can ask

757
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,279
your question

758
00:21:58,558 --> 00:22:02,319
this question comes from our friend

759
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:03,918
newbie nuggs

760
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:05,918
they're growing granddaddy perp to

761
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:08,080
platinum cookies uh they're growing it

762
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:10,000
indoors they're in flower

763
00:22:08,079 --> 00:22:11,519
let's see let's get right to the

764
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,079
question here because it says my

765
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:14,639
question

766
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:16,639
is on cutting clones for sexing so i've

767
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,840
talked about this in a previous episode

768
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,360
if you want to find out if you've got

769
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:20,319
male or female plants and you don't want

770
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:22,719
to wait till they get real

771
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:24,720
big you can cut a clone you can put that

772
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,279
clone in your rapid rooter under your

773
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,440
dome

774
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:28,879
put it under 1212 lighting and quite

775
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,759
quickly it will tell you if it's a male

776
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,200
or a female

777
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:33,440
then you'll know if the plant which that

778
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,720
clone came from was a boy or a girl and

779
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,480
you know if you need to continue working

780
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,960
with that plant or if you can get rid of

781
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,079
it

782
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:42,000
so that catches you up it says now

783
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:44,480
i am practicing saving for a dragon

784
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,919
punch and lemon sunrise for this march

785
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,919
good choices my friend those will grow

786
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:48,240
well in your garden it says i've never

787
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:50,159
ran

788
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,519
regular seeds as i have a five plant

789
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:54,080
limit over five

790
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:55,038
inches so i'm practicing and i took one

791
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:57,359
of my cuts

792
00:22:55,038 --> 00:22:58,158
of the granddaddy purple candyland plant

793
00:22:57,359 --> 00:23:00,639
and put it in

794
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:01,919
soil with mycorrhizae and dipped it in

795
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,240
cloning gel

796
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:05,840
so you got a clone so you've got a five

797
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,120
plant limit which uh that's very

798
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:09,038
restrictive and you want to grow some

799
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:10,639
regular seeds that's understandable

800
00:23:09,038 --> 00:23:12,079
uh we gotta find out which are the males

801
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,759
and females so we don't grow the males

802
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:16,319
up too big and waste time

803
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:16,960
so you are doing a test run to find out

804
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:19,918
how to

805
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,798
sex your plants by doing quick clones uh

806
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:23,120
you took cuts

807
00:23:20,798 --> 00:23:25,519
you took a cut of the gdp candyland

808
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:26,798
plant put it in soil with micros dipped

809
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:28,400
it in cloning gel

810
00:23:26,798 --> 00:23:30,000
immediately put it into the flowering

811
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,880
tent and in a couple of days

812
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,558
you had pre flowers yes ah sounds like

813
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,559
you're doing it right so far

814
00:23:34,558 --> 00:23:39,038
i let it go for another four days

815
00:23:36,558 --> 00:23:41,440
steadily increasing flowering activity

816
00:23:39,038 --> 00:23:42,960
i pulled it and obviously no roots yeah

817
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,679
it hasn't had time for roots at that

818
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,038
point but

819
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:47,120
it said i had no proper rooting

820
00:23:45,038 --> 00:23:48,640
parameters or dome it was just a test oh

821
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:49,439
it wasn't even in a dome that's pretty

822
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,038
amazing

823
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,480
uh it's kind of amazing that it lived

824
00:23:51,038 --> 00:23:54,079
this long uh

825
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,919
over four days in there without a dome

826
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:57,119
that's pretty killer good job man that's

827
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:00,080
uh that's good luck

828
00:23:57,119 --> 00:24:02,239
it says is this a typical case on sexing

829
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:04,960
cuts does it usually happen this quickly

830
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:06,720
and flower without roots or was i lucky

831
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,519
this would help me in culling males

832
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,640
quickly

833
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:14,240
to see uh what meets our laws

834
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:16,000
here so it doesn't usually happen

835
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,679
that quickly i think you got kind of

836
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,599
lucky with the four days

837
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:21,038
but usually seven to ten days you'll be

838
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:23,038
able to tell if you've got males or

839
00:24:21,038 --> 00:24:24,400
females within that time frame

840
00:24:23,038 --> 00:24:26,720
what i think may have happened and i

841
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,080
think we've corresponded since this

842
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,839
what i think may have happened you may

843
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:30,319
have taken your cuts from the top of the

844
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:31,599
plant

845
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:33,200
and the tops are where there are more

846
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:33,519
hormones those plants are a little bit

847
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,120
more

848
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:37,599
or the tops are more ready to go into

849
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:38,239
flower all the hormones have moved up to

850
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:39,839
the top

851
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,519
so that the parts you cut we're like

852
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:43,038
hell yeah let's go into flour

853
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:44,798
when you took it away from the main part

854
00:24:43,038 --> 00:24:45,759
of the plant it kind of went into panic

855
00:24:44,798 --> 00:24:46,000
mode i was like i don't know what the

856
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:48,000
[ __ ]

857
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,440
to do man he took the roots away from me

858
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,599
you changed the light cycle

859
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,720
so it flowered super quickly it had a

860
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:54,480
couple of reasons

861
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,319
to go into flower really quickly so i

862
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:59,440
think that is why that happened

863
00:24:56,319 --> 00:25:00,960
uh in my experience that is quicker than

864
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,240
it's ever happened than i have ever seen

865
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,319
so you got lucky there

866
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,319
and if it was a male that's a powerful

867
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:08,079
potent male that i would not breed with

868
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:09,839
i would skip him because he is too much

869
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:11,678
male for a breeding project that's a

870
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:14,879
good example of one to toss

871
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:15,759
to pass on to get to let go so i think

872
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,278
um

873
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:18,960
and then i think you did respond and say

874
00:25:17,278 --> 00:25:21,519
that it was lower branches

875
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:23,278
so that plant was just big enough and it

876
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:24,240
was happy enough and it was ready to go

877
00:25:23,278 --> 00:25:25,679
into flour

878
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,359
when you did that you just had a nice

879
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:29,440
happy healthy plant with a lot of

880
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:31,199
active hormones going on when you cut

881
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,720
that clone you didn't do any damage to

882
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,440
it when you potted it and you put that

883
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,200
mico

884
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,640
on the rooting gel on there you kept it

885
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,159
completely happy

886
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,840
and it just went into flour for you

887
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:41,200
because it was in the ideal conditions

888
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:42,720
to go into flour

889
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,240
uh you did something right man because

890
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,919
most of the time if you cut a clone and

891
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,679
do not put it in a dome

892
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,759
within a few days like that it will

893
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:51,600
wither up and it will fall over and die

894
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:53,278
so maybe you're on to something i hope

895
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:54,879
you took good notes i hope you remember

896
00:25:53,278 --> 00:25:56,720
exactly what you did so you can do it

897
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,400
again and again and again because this

898
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,400
will be a very effective way

899
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,840
to learn how to cull those boys from

900
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,679
your garden i feel like there's a little

901
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:05,678
bit more to this podcast so let's ke or

902
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:07,278
this uh not the podcast to this uh

903
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:09,038
what is that this is a question that's

904
00:26:07,278 --> 00:26:11,440
what this is um

905
00:26:09,038 --> 00:26:13,839
let's keep reading so i can put my brain

906
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:16,240
back on some sort of a track here

907
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:17,759
uh it says oh that plant was probably in

908
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,558
panic mode because it got so it flipped

909
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:20,079
that's was the

910
00:26:18,558 --> 00:26:21,759
the bottom line there then it says i

911
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:23,278
love the show and i want you to know i

912

975
00:28:09,278 --> 00:28:12,960
ever feel like you've got to do it

976
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:14,239
especially my friend newbie nuggs get

977
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,600
the garden dialed in

978
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,599
live on that tight budget i do

979
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:19,599
understand it is coveted

980
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:22,079
times things can go weird at any moment

981
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:24,240
right now uh so there's more to this

982
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:26,960
it says there is a time empty pods and a

983
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:29,120
money envelope dedicated to you

984
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,640
just has to run its course so my friends

985
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:32,239
got some time

986
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,919
uh empty pot so that he could put the

987
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,120
seeds in and a money envelope so we

988
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:36,960
could start throwing some funding in so

989
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:38,639
we could help out the patreon

990
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,240
just has to run its course i understand

991
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,080
that bro time has got to run its course

992
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,839
hopefully after this pandy goes away

993
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:46,000
we'll get able to get back able to play

994
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:49,038
again get able to make some money again

995
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,599
live life like we used to do it he wraps

996
00:28:49,038 --> 00:28:51,278
up with

997
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:53,038
