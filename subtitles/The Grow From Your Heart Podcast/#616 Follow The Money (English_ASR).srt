put on some headphones turn on a

144
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,878
microphone and hang out with my friends

and take some dabs in there

146
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:14,399
during these quarantine times during

147
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:16,079
these lockdown times if you're listening

148
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,840
in the future right now we're still in

149
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,120
sort of a quarantine situation we're not

150
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,159
allowed to play with our friends as much

151
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,000
as we'd like

152
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,520
during these sort of times uh it's

153
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,439
really nice to have something like a

154
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:27,120
zoom chat like the discord chat

155
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:29,839
things like that to be interactive with

156
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,120
more uh fellow smokers growers stoners

157
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:32,719
like-minded friends

158
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,639
and it's also a beautiful way for me to

159
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,000
keep in touch with the ire army with the

160
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,639
crew the people that are growing my

161
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,720
strains

162
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,319

back you guys get to ask me questions

166
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:47,199
it's funny because sometimes people come

167
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,560
in they're a little bit i hate to say

168
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,840
the word star struck but they've been

relying on your garden for several

261
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,720
things maybe it's medicine

262
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:22,318
maybe it's how you're paying the bills

263

your financial survival when you flip it

have time to hang out in that discord

393
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:10,399
chat at like four in the morning so

394
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:11,679
it's a huge community and i'm

395
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,399
overwhelmed if you can't tell i've been

396
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:13,679
gushing for

397
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,399
several minutes about this but i

398
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:18,719
appreciate it here's the morbid thought

399
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,240
that i had

400
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,000
excuse that throat clearing i did take

401
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,399
some gnarly dabs a minute ago

402
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,759
ah the morbid thought that i had was i

403
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,078
could pass away

404
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:29,200
now this moment as long as this episode

405
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:30,000
makes it out and you guys get my

406
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,879
gratitude

407
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,320
i could pass away right now and this

408
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:36,480
company this podcast

409
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,920
this idea that i created will still

410
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,720
thrive for

411
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:42,078
at least a decade to come until youtube

412
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,920
deletes my episodes

413
00:11:42,078 --> 00:11:45,519
they'll stay up there uh we've got a

414
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:46,799
friend subcool who passed away like a

415
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,879
year ago

416
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:51,919
rest in peace and shout out to subcool i

417
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:53,600
still watch his videos

418
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:55,278
so with that i'm still keeping subby

419
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,200
alive you guys will continue to watch my

420
00:11:55,278 --> 00:12:00,240
videos for a year i'm sure that

421
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,920
also i'm still growing sub cool seeds

422
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,360
so that tells me that when i'm gone

423
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:04,639
hopefully somebody out there is still

424
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,200
growing my seeds

425
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:09,039
for generations then maybe somebody will

426
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,639
breed with them just like i did for sub

427
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:12,480
sub's gone i took some of his stuff i

428
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,320
bred it to keep subby alive

429
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,800
the man may be gone but his work his

430
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,079
legend his idea his vibe will continue

431
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:20,000
as partly my uh

432
00:12:18,078 --> 00:12:22,000
it's partly my job i felt to continue

433
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,039
that so somebody in the ivory army i

434
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,639
have a good feeling of

435
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:26,159
who a few of those people may be some of

436
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,200
them i don't even know i'm sure there

437
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:29,039
are people out there

438
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,639
kicking ass with my genetics doing work

439
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:32,000
for me that i don't even know yet

440
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,079
shout out thank you but there are a few

441
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,600
people i have in mind that i know if i

442
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:37,519
were to pass right now

443
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,200
some of those people would continue the

444
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,959
ire work my strains would be

445
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,040
crossed to other things and crossed with

446
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:43,759
themselves i know people would continue

447
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:46,000
the vibe

448
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:47,919
the website would be continued to

449
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,879
survive for quite a while it comes from

450
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:50,958
a bank account

451
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:52,000
until that bank account is drained the

452
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:54,638
website would exist

453
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
so if i passed away at this moment after

454
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:57,278
i put out this podcast we'll say just

455
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,919
after i hit post you guys get to hear

456
00:12:57,278 --> 00:13:00,639

457
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:02,719
uh this company iriegenetics this

458
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:04,079
podcast the grow from your heart podcast

459
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,639
will survive

460
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:08,239
indefinitely uh possibly infinitely as

461
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:10,480
long as youtube goes on

462
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,839
this exists which is [Â __Â ] cool as

463
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,200
long as you guys are growing and

464
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:14,000
breeding and taking care of the clones

465
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,399
and seeds

466
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,679
the vibe the idea that i created now at

467
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,440
this point will last

468
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:21,359
almost indefinitely and that's [Â __Â ]

469
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,800
beautiful keep it going you guys

470
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,720

474
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,159
podcast

475
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,480
the slogan behind irie genetics used to

476
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:34,480
be

477
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,560
grow from your heart and breed with love

478
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,480
uh we kind of separated the two entities

479
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:40,000
to have two different llc's here but

480
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,600
grow from your heart man that's always

481
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,078
what it's been about so

482
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,120

keep growing from your heart you guys

484
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,679
and it'll keep going so i'm spreading

00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,160
that love spreading that vibe is my

486
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:49,838

done a show about which companies are

502
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:19,679
owned by hawthorne or plan on doing

503
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,799
that episode maybe some people are going

504
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:22,159
that's random why do we care about

505
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:24,078
what's owned by hawthorne

506
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:26,000
that's a really good question i'm not

507
00:14:24,078 --> 00:14:27,919
going to do a specific episode on

508
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,639
companies which are owned by hawthorne

509
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:33,599
but this will set me up for a good rant

510
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:35,839
which goes a lot like this i'm not going

511
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,879
to bash or roast any certain brands or

512
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:38,880
companies

513
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:40,639
we know who we shouldn't support we know

514
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:42,559
most of us know who we should not be

515
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:45,039
supporting who the big devils are

516
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:45,759
in agriculture and commercial in the

517
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:48,879
world

518
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:50,240
uh in capitalism in just politics and

519
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:52,159
[Â __Â ] economics

520
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,919
we kind of know who we should be voting

521
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:56,480
who we should be avoiding

522
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:58,159
uh i'm kind of an older guy by now i'm

523
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,759
42 years old i've got a good idea of

524
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:01,278
where my money should go and

525
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:03,120
who's getting my money and who makes

526
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:05,039
what and who runs what at this point

527
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,959
so maybe some of you guys haven't put

528
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:07,838
too much thought about where the money

529
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:10,879
goes

530
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:13,120
so um here's the thing to think about

531
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:14,879
this guy is saying uh have why done a

532
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,360
show about hawthorne hawthorne is kind

533
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:17,519
of

534
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,360
a big company that owns a lot of things

535
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,799
they may not have the best values they

536
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,639
may not have the best uh

537
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:24,159
views on keeping the world safe and

538
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,240
healthy they may not be the best at

539
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:28,240
keeping humans safe and healthy they may

540
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,560
be focused more on the dollars

541
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,079
than the long-term effects of human

542
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:33,359
safety environmental safety and

543
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:36,239
environmental impact

544
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:38,000
so we're going to do a little talk about

545
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,399
avoiding those types of companies

546
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,720
and basically scotty real puts it best

547
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,198
scotty real says vote with your dollars

548
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,560
man

549
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:46,719
so we're going to talk about voting with

550
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:48,000
our dollars uh the word i wrote was

551
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,680
conscious spending

552
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,919
another thing i wrote on my flow chart

553
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:54,399
here was follow the money man

554
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:56,319
so when you're shopping for uh i'm gonna

555
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:59,519
focus this on grow supplies

556
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:01,680
nutrients soil soilless mix uh we'll go

557
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,120
as far as saying lights and equipment

558
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:04,879
anything in your grow but this could

559
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,560
apply to anything

560
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:08,399
in your life wherever you're spending

561
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:10,078
money time energy

562
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,919
is it worth it is it somewhere you want

563
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:14,799
to spend your hard-earned

564
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:16,078
money time energy money's expensive man

565
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:17,359
you work hard for it

566
00:16:16,078 --> 00:16:19,439
you've got to do something you don't

567
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,278
want to do for a certain amount of time

568
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,959
probably unless you're blessed and have

569
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:24,559
it really lucky you're probably working

570
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:26,159
for somebody you don't like who doesn't

571
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:27,679
appreciate you that doesn't see how hard

572
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:28,958
you work that doesn't understand how

573
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:31,359
hard your struggle is

574
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:32,799
and it sucks so money's expensive

575
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,360
putting in your time and energy to get

576
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:35,120
money

577
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,800
that is expensive so follow the money

578
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,759
when you're spending it do you want to

579
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:39,838
spend that money

580
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:41,199
if you know that when you buy a product

581
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,720
you may have two options

582
00:16:41,198 --> 00:16:45,278
does the company that you buy a product

583
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:48,560
from does company a use that money to

584
00:16:45,278 --> 00:16:50,000
uh reforest the rain forest or some [Â __Â ]

585
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:52,319
and does the other company use that

586
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,559
money to shoot babies

587
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,759
uh on sundays who are you spending your

588
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:57,599
money with we already know we're gonna

589
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,560
save the rainforest not shoot babies on

590
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,720
sunday right

591
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:02,399
so that's an easy way to decide how to

592
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,000
spend your money do a little research on

593
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,599
where the money goes once you spend

594
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,519
it what are you going to do with it bro

595
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:09,119
are you going to support a presidential

596
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:10,160
candidate that we are not up for are you

597
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,798
going to support a presidential

598
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,959
candidate

599
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:14,720
that is on cannabis side because why are

600
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,798
you going to spend your money

601
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,959
with a company who is against the thing

602
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:21,119
that you're buying their product to do

603
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,798
so i don't want to be political but also

604
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:24,318
kind of it's not just political this is

605
00:17:22,798 --> 00:17:26,639
a personal thing this is

606
00:17:24,318 --> 00:17:28,240
uh this is a personal decision this is

607
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,440
some things a conscious decision we need

608
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,279
to start making

609
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,679
uh maybe some people aren't aware of

610
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:35,839
that does your contribution go to a good

611
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:38,720
cause or does your contribution go

612
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:40,558
to more research to create more products

613
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,000
that are not going to be desirable for

614
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:43,759
our planet our world

615
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,359
i'm trying not to bash too many specific

616
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:47,200
companies say too many names

617
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:48,719
we all know that monsanto is the devil

618
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,640
that scots is the devil

619
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,558
anybody that falls in that umbrella we

620
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:55,360
may not want to give them our money

621
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:55,918
if you've got the option to give your

622
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:59,199
money

623
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:00,960
to a mom and pop shop at bro and chick

624
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,200
owned shop in your neighborhood

625
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,000
maybe some uh lady that's been in the

626
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,319
grow community

627
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,240
opened up a new hydro store go shop

628
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:10,319
there avoid that big box shop

629
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,000
if you can i understand that some people

630
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:13,678
some places some locations

631
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,279
the only thing you've got is that big

632
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,640
chain store you have to go to lowe's you

633
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:18,160
may have to go to home depot you may

634
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,480
have to hit the walmart

635
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:22,320
but if there's a small shop that is

636
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,599
available it may be a dollar or two more

637
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:25,839
to shop there but

638
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:27,439
it's worth your time effort and energy

639
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:30,159
to support that family

640
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,679
when you buy something from bill's

641

garden supply store

642

bill gets to buy himself a truck and

643
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,919

644
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:41,119

00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,519
when you do need something that only

668
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,960
they carry that place might not be there

669
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:24,720
if you go to walmart if you go to home

670
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,480
depot if you go to lowe's and you've got

671
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:29,440
a couple of questions hey bill

672
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:31,200
what's the best way to do this maybe you

673
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,960
get somebody at home depot or lowe's

674
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,640
that's slightly competent

675
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,960
competent that might be the word i tried

676
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,000
to say but if you go talk to bill at

677
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,679
bill's hardware

678
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,440
bill will have six or seven different

679
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,960
ideas on how to do it he'll find out

680
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,480
which is the best idea for you he'll

681
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,759
walk you up and down the aisles

682
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,440
build you a little shopping cart or the

683
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:48,879
[Â __Â ] that's gonna work best for you

684
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,080
shake your hand and wish you the best

685
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,520
and send you on your way

686
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:52,879
when you come back in two or three days

687
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:54,319
with pictures of the job on your phone

688
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,360
bill's gonna high-five you

689
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:57,359
you guys are gonna be friends you're

690
00:19:55,359 --> 00:19:58,879
gonna be part of the community not just

691
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:00,639
walking into a big box

692
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,000
being another zombie with a credit card

693
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,759
leaving with a bunch of plastic

694
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
[Â __Â ] going home and hoping you've got

695
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:08,558
what you've got and giving our money to

696
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,640
the waltons and china so that was kind

697
00:20:08,558 --> 00:20:11,200
of a weird long rant for a podcast about

698
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,200
cannabis

699
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,720
but let's follow the money when we're

700
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,640
shopping let's

701
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:19,200
follow the money conscious spending

702
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:21,120
conscious shopping conscious consuming

703
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,880
uh vote with your dollars man that's

704
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:25,599
basically what i'm trying to say

705
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,559
so when you're gonna buy a product if

706
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:29,519
you can

707
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:31,279
buy a locally sourced product if you can

708
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:32,400
i understand that not everything is made

709
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:34,639
everywhere

710
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:37,519
buy something local if it's not made

711
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:40,000
local buy it from a store that is local

712
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:40,879
and if not then think about where is the

713
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,720
money going

714
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,919
once i buy this hopefully it goes to a

715
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,000
local grow store

716
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:47,280
so that bill's gross store gets to pay

717
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,880
their bills they get to pay the light

718
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:50,558
bill they get to pay the rent then bill

719
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,280
gets to pay his mortgage and buy some

720
00:20:50,558 --> 00:20:52,879
groceries

721
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:54,480
take care of the family that's always a

722
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,480
feel-good feeling right

723
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,798
then hopefully that money is going to a

724
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:01,519
company that is making a quality product

725
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:02,639
and not using a bunch of crappy uh

726
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:04,639
imported or

727
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,159
half-assed ingredients hopefully we're

728
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,679
trying to keep our money close to home

729
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:09,760
with people that we care about

730
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:12,080
instead of just watching it go blindly

731
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:13,279
just causes which we do not support

732
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:15,359
all right i feel like i've spent enough

733
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:17,359
time on that message uh

734
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:19,599
let's see do you want your name shouted

735
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:20,879
out i don't see your name on here at all

736
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:22,798
so i'm not going to give you

737
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,559
an uh shout out by name but you know who

738
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:25,279

739
00:21:24,558 --> 00:21:28,240
and thank you

740
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:31,519
for sparking a great line of ranting on

741
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,960
this episode of the podcast

742
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:35,200
all right this next message came from

743
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:37,159
the grow help tab on my website that's

744
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,519
right if you go to the website

745
00:21:37,159 --> 00:21:41,280
iriegenetics.com on the top bar there is

746
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:43,279
a grow help tab click on that

747
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:44,879
you will be able to ask a grow question

748
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:47,038
and ask for grow advice

749
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,880
we do ask a few preliminary questions

750
00:21:47,038 --> 00:21:50,079
before we get there we ask your name

751
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,080
what strain you're growing if you're

752
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:53,439
growing indoors or outdoors you will see

753
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:54,639
the questionnaire if you do go to the

754
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,240
website and jump on that

755
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,440
grow help tab just click on that it'll

756
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,558
get you right to it then you can ask

757
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,279
your question

758
00:21:58,558 --> 00:22:02,319
this question comes from our friend

759
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:03,918
newbie nuggs

760
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:05,918
they're growing granddaddy perp to

761
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:08,080
platinum cookies uh they're growing it

762
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:10,000
indoors they're in flower

763
00:22:08,079 --> 00:22:11,519
let's see let's get right to the

764
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,079
question here because it says my

765
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:14,639
question

766
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:16,639
is on cutting clones for sexing so i've

767
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,840
talked about this in a previous episode

768
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,360
if you want to find out if you've got

769
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:20,319
male or female plants and you don't want

770
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:22,719
to wait till they get real

771
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:24,720
big you can cut a clone you can put that

772
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,279
clone in your rapid rooter under your

773
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,440
dome

774
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:28,879
put it under 1212 lighting and quite

775
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,759
quickly it will tell you if it's a male

776
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,200
or a female

777
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:33,440
then you'll know if the plant which that

778
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,720
clone came from was a boy or a girl and

779
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,480
you know if you need to continue working

780
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,960
with that plant or if you can get rid of

781
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,079
it

782
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:42,000
so that catches you up it says now

783
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:44,480
i am practicing saving for a dragon

784
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,919
punch and lemon sunrise for this march

785
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,919
good choices my friend those will grow

786
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:48,240
well in your garden it says i've never

787
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:50,159
ran

788
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,519
regular seeds as i have a five plant

789
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:54,080
limit over five

790
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:55,038
inches so i'm practicing and i took one

791
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:57,359
of my cuts

792
00:22:55,038 --> 00:22:58,158
of the granddaddy purple candyland plant

793
00:22:57,359 --> 00:23:00,639
and put it in

794
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:01,919
soil with mycorrhizae and dipped it in

795
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,240
cloning gel

796
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:05,840
so you got a clone so you've got a five

797
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,120
plant limit which uh that's very

798
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:09,038
restrictive and you want to grow some

799
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:10,639
regular seeds that's understandable

800
00:23:09,038 --> 00:23:12,079
uh we gotta find out which are the males

801
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,759
and females so we don't grow the males

802
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:16,319
up too big and waste time

803
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:16,960
so you are doing a test run to find out

804
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:19,918
how to

805
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,798
sex your plants by doing quick clones uh

806
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:23,120
you took cuts

807
00:23:20,798 --> 00:23:25,519
you took a cut of the gdp candyland

808
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:26,798
plant put it in soil with micros dipped

809
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:28,400
it in cloning gel

810
00:23:26,798 --> 00:23:30,000
immediately put it into the flowering

811
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,880
tent and in a couple of days

812
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,558
you had pre flowers yes ah sounds like

813
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,559
you're doing it right so far

814
00:23:34,558 --> 00:23:39,038
i let it go for another four days

815
00:23:36,558 --> 00:23:41,440
steadily increasing flowering activity

816
00:23:39,038 --> 00:23:42,960
i pulled it and obviously no roots yeah

817
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,679
it hasn't had time for roots at that

818
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,038
point but

819
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:47,120
it said i had no proper rooting

820
00:23:45,038 --> 00:23:48,640
parameters or dome it was just a test oh

821
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:49,439
it wasn't even in a dome that's pretty

822
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,038
amazing

823
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,480
uh it's kind of amazing that it lived

824
00:23:51,038 --> 00:23:54,079
this long uh

825
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,919
over four days in there without a dome

826
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:57,119
that's pretty killer good job man that's

827
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:00,080
uh that's good luck

828
00:23:57,119 --> 00:24:02,239
it says is this a typical case on sexing

829
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:04,960
cuts does it usually happen this quickly

830
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:06,720
and flower without roots or was i lucky

831
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,519
this would help me in culling males

832
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,640
quickly

833
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:14,240
to see uh what meets our laws

834
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:16,000
here so it doesn't usually happen

835
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,679
that quickly i think you got kind of

836
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,599
lucky with the four days

837
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:21,038
but usually seven to ten days you'll be

838
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:23,038
able to tell if you've got males or

839
00:24:21,038 --> 00:24:24,400
females within that time frame

840
00:24:23,038 --> 00:24:26,720
what i think may have happened and i

841
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,080
think we've corresponded since this

842
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,839
what i think may have happened you may

843
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:30,319
have taken your cuts from the top of the

844
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:31,599
plant

845
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:33,200
and the tops are where there are more

846
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:33,519
hormones those plants are a little bit

847
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,120
more

848
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:37,599
or the tops are more ready to go into

849
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:38,239
flower all the hormones have moved up to

850
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:39,839
the top

851
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,519
so that the parts you cut we're like

852
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:43,038
hell yeah let's go into flour

853
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:44,798
when you took it away from the main part

854
00:24:43,038 --> 00:24:45,759
of the plant it kind of went into panic

855
00:24:44,798 --> 00:24:46,000
mode i was like i don't know what the

856
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:48,000
[Â __Â ]

857
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,440
to do man he took the roots away from me

858
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,599
you changed the light cycle

859
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,720
so it flowered super quickly it had a

860
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:54,480
couple of reasons

861
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,319
to go into flower really quickly so i

862
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:59,440
think that is why that happened

863
00:24:56,319 --> 00:25:00,960
uh in my experience that is quicker than

864
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,240
it's ever happened than i have ever seen

865
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,319
so you got lucky there

866
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,319
and if it was a male that's a powerful

867
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:08,079
potent male that i would not breed with

868
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:09,839
i would skip him because he is too much

869
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:11,678
male for a breeding project that's a

870
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:14,879
good example of one to toss

871
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:15,759
to pass on to get to let go so i think

872
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,278
um

873
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:18,960
and then i think you did respond and say

874
00:25:17,278 --> 00:25:21,519
that it was lower branches

875
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:23,278
so that plant was just big enough and it

876
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:24,240
was happy enough and it was ready to go

877
00:25:23,278 --> 00:25:25,679
into flour

878
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,359
when you did that you just had a nice

879
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:29,440
happy healthy plant with a lot of

880
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:31,199
active hormones going on when you cut

881
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,720
that clone you didn't do any damage to

882
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,440
it when you potted it and you put that

883
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,200
mico

884
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,640
on the rooting gel on there you kept it

885
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,159
completely happy

886
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,840
and it just went into flour for you

887
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:41,200
because it was in the ideal conditions

888
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:42,720
to go into flour

889
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,240
uh you did something right man because

890
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,919
most of the time if you cut a clone and

891
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,679
do not put it in a dome

892
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,759
within a few days like that it will

893
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:51,600
wither up and it will fall over and die

894
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:53,278
so maybe you're on to something i hope

895
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:54,879
you took good notes i hope you remember

896
00:25:53,278 --> 00:25:56,720
exactly what you did so you can do it

897
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,400
again and again and again because this

898
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,400
will be a very effective way

899
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,840
to learn how to cull those boys from

900
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,679
your garden i feel like there's a little

901
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:05,678
bit more to this podcast so let's ke or

902
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:07,278
this uh not the podcast to this uh

903
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:09,038
what is that this is a question that's

904
00:26:07,278 --> 00:26:11,440
what this is um

905
00:26:09,038 --> 00:26:13,839
let's keep reading so i can put my brain

906
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:16,240
back on some sort of a track here

907
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:17,759
uh it says oh that plant was probably in

908
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,558
panic mode because it got so it flipped

909
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:20,079
that's was the

910
00:26:18,558 --> 00:26:21,759
the bottom line there then it says i

911
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:23,278
love the show and i want you to know i

912

you guys uh for the support but don't

975
00:28:09,278 --> 00:28:12,960
ever feel like you've got to do it

976
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:14,239
especially my friend newbie nuggs get

977
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,600
the garden dialed in

978
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,599
live on that tight budget i do

979
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:19,599
understand it is coveted

980
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:22,079
times things can go weird at any moment

981
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:24,240
right now uh so there's more to this

982
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:26,960
it says there is a time empty pods and a

983
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:29,120
money envelope dedicated to you

984
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,640
just has to run its course so my friends

985
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:32,239
got some time

986
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,919
uh empty pot so that he could put the

987
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,120
seeds in and a money envelope so we

988
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:36,960
could start throwing some funding in so

989
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:38,639
we could help out the patreon

990
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,240
just has to run its course i understand

991
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,080
that bro time has got to run its course

992
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,839
hopefully after this pandy goes away

993
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:46,000
we'll get able to get back able to play

994
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:49,038
again get able to make some money again

995
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,599
live life like we used to do it he wraps

996
00:28:49,038 --> 00:28:51,278
