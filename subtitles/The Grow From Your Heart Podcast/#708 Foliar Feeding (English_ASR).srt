description to make it nice and easy for

39
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,879
all of my friends all right i don't have

40
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:41,118
anything to ramble about here at the

41
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:43,759
start of the show let's jump right into

42
00:01:41,118 --> 00:01:45,920
a discussion about foliar feeding our

43
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,519
plants what is foliar feeding that's a

44
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,320
good place to start

45
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:52,879
foliar feeding is spraying our plants

46
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:54,478
with a nutrient solution to provide

47
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:56,718
nutrients to the plants that's right

48
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:58,399
sometimes we uh can't water the plants

49
00:01:56,718 --> 00:02:00,640
sometimes it's not necessary to water

50
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:03,040
the plant uh sometimes there are no

51
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,640
roots to water so we foliar feed that

52
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,799
plant to give it nutrients to give it

53
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,118
life to give it sustenance to keep it

54
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:11,039
green vigorous lush and healthy

55
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:13,759
throughout its life

56
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:16,159
what are some things we would foliar

57
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:19,280
feed our plants some very commonly fed

58
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:21,680
things are nitro uh nitrogen and calcium

59
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,598
i tried to combine that into one word

60
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,599
that has not been invented yet it is

61
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:29,039
still nitrogen and calcium also many

62
00:02:26,598 --> 00:02:30,399
micronutrients are good for foliar

63
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:31,759
feeding we can fully feed a lot of

64
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,840
things the most important part about

65
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:35,359
foliar feeding i shouldn't say the most

66
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,439
one of the most important a big

67
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,920
important part is to have a strategy

68
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:41,680
have a goal why are you foliar feeding

69
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:43,759
what is the plant deficient in what are

70
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,000
you trying to boost up a little bit

71
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:48,560
have a timing a strategy a rhyme and a

72
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,239
reason for it or it can go terribly

73
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,080
wrong but it can be a great booster it

74
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,640
can be a great corrector it can be a

75
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,280
very useful tool in our arsenal as a

76
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:59,039
grower so let's talk about foliar

77
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,800
feeding i just mentioned why would we

78
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:03,439
foliar feed some plants i've got a very

79
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:06,480
good example of why i foliar fed some

80
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:09,359
plants just recently i recently bought a

81
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:11,199
new batch of soil supplies are limited

82
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,720
we are in this weird pandemic still

83
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:14,639
things are not arriving at the stores

84
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:17,039
like we would hope and expect them to

85
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:19,119
for a small grow project i bought a new

86
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:21,359
batch of soil i've never used and

87
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,680
honestly it does not drain well it needs

88
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,599
more aeration it needs more fluff to it

89
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,120
i should have mixed that in before i got

90
00:03:25,598 --> 00:03:29,039
the plants in there however i did not

91
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,519
realize it i thought it would work when

92
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:33,199
i watered those plants that soilless mix

93
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,719
really crushed down on those plants the

94
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:36,479
roots are kind of suffocated they're not

95
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:38,158
happy with me they're not growing as

96
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:39,840
well as they could be and most

97
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:41,759
importantly they're not drying at the

98
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,479
rate that i would hope that size of a

99
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:46,798
pot with that much water would dry

100
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:49,039
now those plants still need nutrients i

101
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,959
want to feed them but i can't give them

102
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:53,039
nutrients in the root zone because that

103
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,120
is already soaked already saturated i

104
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:57,039
want that to dry up that's going to get

105
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,719
uh probably two or three watering cycles

106
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:00,959
before it actually does get watered

107
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:02,878
again so at this time to provide

108
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,239
nutrients for those freshly transplanted

109
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:06,239
plants that are stubborn that are kind

110
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,920
of not wanting to grow they are getting

111
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,680
foliar feather getting their nitrogen

112
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:12,158
their calcium a couple other base

113
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:15,200
nutrients are happening through a foliar

114
00:04:12,158 --> 00:04:16,879
feeding so that's one reason why i am

115
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:18,798
feeding the plants with the foliar feed

116
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:21,120
i'm gonna let them dry keep hitting them

117
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:23,519
with that foliar feed until they are

118
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,120
ready for a nutrient feed i won't overdo

119
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:28,079
it i will pay close attention we'll talk

120
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,199
about dosing them uh the nutrient amount

121
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:31,039
here in just a moment i'm paying

122
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,960
attention to my notes to make sure i

123
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,360
didn't get off track because i already

124
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:38,000
got off track there we go um so follow

125
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,919
your feed clones we often fully feed our

126
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,600
clones when i cut clones they don't have

127
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:43,758
roots when you cut clones they start off

128
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,840
with no roots how do we feed them we

129
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,600
feed them through that humidity dome

130
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:49,198
through the uh the humidity in the room

131
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,199
also i'll take off that dome and hit

132
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,360
them straight with a sprayer and foliar

133
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:55,600
feed them with a light nutrient solution

134
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,840
that is technically fully feeding those

135
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,120
plants so the clones always take a good

136
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,638
foliar

137
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,439
another reason to follow your feed our

138
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:06,240
plants is to provide a specific nutrient

139
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:08,000
to a specific plant in a room uh maybe

140
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,360
you've got a hydroponic setup or an ebb

141
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,360
and flow set up to where all of the

142
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,038
plants are getting fed the same thing

143
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,720
maybe one plant and there is stubborn

144
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:16,560
maybe it wants a little bit more maybe

145
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,479
it's hungry maybe it needs extra

146
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,720
nitrogen maybe it needs extra phosphorus

147
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:22,639
maybe it needs extra calmag what we can

148
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,199
do is we can mix up those nutrients in a

149
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,639
foliar solution and apply it to that one

150
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,400
plant directly

151
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,400
through a foliar application instead of

152
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:32,159
trying to boost up all of the feed in

153
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:34,399
the entire hydroponic system or

154
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:37,039
aquaponic system or whatever we can feed

155
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:38,638
that one stubborn plant that congo plant

156
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:40,159
in the corner that wants more food than

157
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,720
everybody that golden goat plant that

158
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:45,360
eats extra we can feed it without over

159
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,600
feeding the rest of our plants

160
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,280
now let's talk about the actual act of

161
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,280
foliar feeding our plants we know a

162
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:53,758
little bit about what to feed

163
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:55,359
i told you definitely have a reason why

164
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,600
you were foliar feeding you can use the

165
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,680
foliar feed to correct you can use it to

166
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,520
boost you can use it as a regular feed

167
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,959
but have a strategy and a reason and

168
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:04,799
when you do it write it down i will

169
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:06,560
mention that again later let's talk

170
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,439
about actually foliar feeding we know

171
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:12,079
why we know what to feed it uh let's

172
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:13,680
talk about doing the actual task

173
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:15,680
usually you're going to i would

174
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,840
recommend spraying most of our sprays

175
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,879
are going to happen in veg or early

176
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:23,038
flower i recommend not spraying chunky

177
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:25,680
buds unless you've got a very good

178
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:27,439
reason chunky buds do not need to get

179
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,600
sprayed if you've got bugs if you've got

180
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:31,600
problems if you're trying to boost it up

181
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,240
find a better solution if you're getting

182
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,600
big chunky nuggets any time past like

183
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,000
week three

184
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,560
day 21 is usually the last time i will

185
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,240
spray unless it's highly necessary i

186
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,399
will hit the plants

187
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,160
at day 21 of flower they're starting to

188
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:48,318
set those good bud sets give them one

189
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,639
good final foliar feed one good final

190
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,160
pesticide rinse and hope that that lasts

191
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,800
you for the next six or seven weeks to

192
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:57,280
get you to harvest so don't spray chunky

193
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,598
buds if you've got to spray buds that

194
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:01,519
are developing remember those buds do

195
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:03,759
have trichomes on the outside that act

196
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:05,680
like a water repellent as a uv

197
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,520
protectant i think the uv anyway let's

198
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,598
get back on track the trichomes will

199
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:11,918
protect from a little bit of water uh

200
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:13,839
the plants are going to be okay with a

201
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:16,159
mist but we don't want to saturate the

202
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:17,918
buds they're they're spongy think about

203
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,880
all the their sponge if you squeeze them

204
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:20,560
and let them go there's a lot of

205
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:22,719
moisture in there they can hold a lot of

206
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,199
water don't create a problem for your

207
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,360
chunky buds do not spray them the next

208
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:30,000
thing i've got in my notes is avoid

209
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,919
horticultural and botanical oils

210
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,800
especially if you are going to make

211
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:37,120
concentrates out of your products

212
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,199
all of those oils will end up in your

213
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,038
concentrate if they don't evaporate

214
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:43,280
dissipate or get washed off in some

215
00:07:41,038 --> 00:07:45,759
other manner they're going to end up in

216
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:47,439
your flowers and your concentrates have

217
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,680
you ever gone to the dispensary or even

218
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:51,759
bought herb from a friend or a regular

219
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,280
person that you know somewhere um they

220
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,840
just sold you some herb and you smoke it

221
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:57,839
it's got like a a minty flavor or sort

222
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:59,279
of a an aftershave sort of flavor or

223
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:01,038
something that is probably from some of

224
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:03,839
the funky oils that they applied to the

225
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:06,159
plant to prevent powdery mildew or other

226
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:07,279
molds or pest problems so don't spray

227
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,639
your plants

228
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:13,359
with oils i especially do not like neem

229
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:15,120
oil i don't like peppermint rosemary

230
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,720
none of that hippie oil if you're going

231
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,720
to use that for your hippie magic do

232
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,800
that but not on the plants please that's

233
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,960
going to make the plants taste like [ __ ]

234
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,960
if you've ever i've been in the room or

235
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:26,959
been involved in concentrate making of

236
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:29,279
all different types when you're making

237
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:31,918
bho concentrates you can see some of the

238
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:34,319
pesticides and oils float to the top

239
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:36,319
uh there's your concentrate your

240
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,039
crystals at the bottom the liquid in the

241
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:41,039
middle the terps at the top and then

242
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:42,479
that funky layer of frothy [ __ ] that's

243
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:44,240
the [ __ ] you should not have sprayed on

244
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:47,360
there that's your pesticides your

245
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,560
contaminants uh possibly a surfectant

246
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,600
that's a lot of [ __ ] that could have

247
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:50,958
been in there so if you're making

248
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,720
concentrates

249
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:55,359
don't spray and also don't spray your

250
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,959
flowers with funky [ __ ] now let's talk

251
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,519
about foliar feeding a little bit more

252
00:08:56,958 --> 00:09:02,000
in depth go light when you are foliar

253
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:04,240
feeding you're applying this directly to

254
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,480
the leaves we don't need that if it says

255
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:10,959
apply 100 only apply about 15 to 25

256
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,680
remember you can spray more but you

257
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:16,079
can't un-spray those nutrients if you

258
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:18,159
see some burn some leaf curl some leaf

259
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,879
damage that is because you sprayed too

260
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:22,958
hard or my next note you possibly

261
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:24,240
sprayed with the lights on turn the

262
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:26,958
lights off

263
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,879
foliar feed or spray wait for the foliar

264
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:30,958
feed to completely turn the fans off as

265
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:33,200
well turn the lights and the fans off

266
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:35,679
apply your foliar feed wait for that to

267
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,920
dry then turn the lights back on if you

268
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:39,519
spray with the lights on uh remember

269
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:40,719
when you were a kid a lot of boys did

270
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,320
this you girls won't know what i'm

271
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,600
talking about probably

272
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,440
when we were a kid we would get a

273
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,440
magnifying glass and you could burn ants

274
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,040
or you could catch paper on fire with

275
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,480
the magnifying glass

276
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:52,399
by using the sun

277
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,000
and that bubble angle of the light and

278
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,679
you could focus that light on a piece of

279
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,600
paper or possibly the ants if you were

280
00:09:55,679 --> 00:10:00,079
creepy and you could catch some [ __ ] on

281
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,159
fire i think that that bubble that is on

282
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,839
your leaf surface acts with the grow

283
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:06,480
light and it will make the same type of

284
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:08,040
burn on your plants we will get or also

285
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,839
we can potentially get some

286
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:12,480
phytotoxicity from the light and the

287
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:15,120
heat interacting with some foliar feeds

288
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:18,800
especially oily pesticides

289
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:20,399
so my advice spray a light solution of

290
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:22,958
of full your feet if you're using

291
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:25,759
nutrients go lightly and also spray

292
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:27,119
always in the dark with the lights off i

293
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:28,720
don't have the grow lights on the light

294
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,560
above me like the little led light

295
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,320
lighting up the room that is cool but

296
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:34,319
your grow lights turn those off any high

297
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,760
intensity lighting for your grow turn

298
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,760
that off your normal room light so you

299
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:39,278
could see and work that'll be just fine

300
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:41,200
but we don't want the big grow lights

301
00:10:39,278 --> 00:10:44,240
the big bright [ __ ] turn that off we

302
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:46,240
don't want to get problems on the plants

303
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,240
all right also i said a moment ago that

304
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,480
using a surfactant will pop up in our

305
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,240
concentrates oftentimes if you're going

306
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,759
to spray something it is a good idea to

307
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,399
use a surfactant that is something to

308
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:58,240
think about that is a sticker and a

309
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,320
spreader something you would mix in with

310
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,079
your foliar feed i use this with a

311
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,320
pesticide with the foliar feed quite

312
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:06,479
often in veg i wouldn't do this

313
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,000
past the late veg stage because this may

314
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,399
pop up in your concentrates but

315
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,958
something to spread and stick this

316
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:15,120
application to the leaves

317
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:17,199
they sell products dish soap is

318
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,278
acceptable cocoa wet is acceptable there

319
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,360
are a lot of great things that will work

320
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:23,200
as a surfactant if you feel like you

321
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,360
need it i use it to make the product

322
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,120
stick and go further because oftentimes

323
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,639
i'm working in a commercial grow and

324
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,560
every little bit helps i think it'll

325
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:32,720
really help if you're in a small grow it

326
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:35,119
may not do a big difference but i think

327
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,040
it helps all right um also don't spray

328
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,959
that too late don't go after week three

329
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:40,799
or week two of flour don't use your

330
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:43,039
surfactants any sort of oils anything

331
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:45,120
like that it's best not to spray at all

332
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:48,000
i understand [ __ ] happens you may have

333
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,759
to do some stuff i get it adapt adjust

334
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,720
save the crop all right when we are

335
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:55,200
fully feeding i would recommend a ph of

336
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:58,079
around seven adjust the ph of your

337
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,440
foliar feed to about seven six eight

338
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:01,519
seven two somewhere around there is

339
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:04,000
going to be good seven will work the

340
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:07,200
best to not burn the leaves and achieve

341
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,879
best nutrient absorption depending on

342
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,800
the nutrients you are applying to these

343
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:12,720
plants that's also going to matter a lot

344
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:14,639
all right let's keep moving forward

345
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,040
spray the plants starting at the bottom

346
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:19,759
and work your way up this is standard

347
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:21,199
horticultural spraying practice my

348
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:23,519
tongue is not liking the word

349
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,360
horticultural today i don't know why but

350
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,519
when we are applying pesticides or a

351
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,839
foliar feed to the plants start at the

352
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:32,399
bottom uh the bottom inside of the plant

353
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:34,399
work your way out and up so kind of

354
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,000
work in the middle spray out toward the

355
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:37,519
outer edge then work your way up the

356
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,799
plant lifting the leaves as you go a

357
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,799
little bit getting the bottom of the

358
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:42,399
leaves and that also gets the top of the

359
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:43,679
leaves that you just sprayed you'll get

360
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,440
the whole thing

361
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:47,838
something to think about

362
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:50,160
i like to spray a foliar feed on the top

363
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:51,519
of the leaf and a pesticide on the

364
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:52,399
bottom of the leaf is kind of how i

365
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,078
focus

366
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,000
uh if i'm hitting it hard i will coat

367
00:12:54,078 --> 00:12:57,278
that entire [ __ ] plant just to make

368
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,958
sure there are no bugs in there just

369
00:12:57,278 --> 00:13:01,200
depends on what the goal is

370
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:03,199
but rule of thumb kind of in general

371
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,480
pesticides on the bottom fold your feet

372
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,879
on the top of the leaf if you're trying

373
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,720
to be economical cost effective that's

374
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:10,320
the best way to do it so spray at the

375
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,360
bottom work your way up

376
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:15,440
don't over spray with a foliar feed but

377
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,639
coat and soak the leaves or don't over

378
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,720
spray that's what i said we don't want

379
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,480
it running off and draining off you

380
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,839
don't want the outer edge of the plants

381
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,519
on the ground to look like it was

382
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:25,120
raining you want to maybe look like it

383
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,519
got misted there a little bit don't

384
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,278
waste your pesticides don't over spray

385
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,959
if you over spray you risk the potential

386
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:32,958
of all that spray running right off of

387
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:34,958
your plants you want it to be on there

388
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:36,319
the smaller the bubbles the better if

389
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:38,078
you can get

390
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,160
super small bubbles to spray on your

391
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:42,399
plants the better the plants will absorb

392
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:44,159
more that way they'll get more of the if

393
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:46,879
it's a foliar feed or a pesticide

394
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:49,039
application they will get the best with

395
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:51,919
a smaller bubbles i'm making sure i'm

396
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:53,519
following my notes here uh spray the top

397
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:55,679
bottom for bugs

398
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:58,000
always write down what you've sprayed uh

399
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:59,759
write down what you sprayed exactly how

400
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
much of it you sprayed when you sprayed

401
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:03,600
it the date every plant they got sprayed

402
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,519
in a commercial environment i talk about

403
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,959
this a lot you've already heard this in

404
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:10,159
a commercial environment we have to

405
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:12,078
write down what we sprayed our license

406
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:14,639
number the epa number of the product we

407
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:16,559
sprayed what time we applied it how much

408
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,240
of it we used per gallon of water how

409
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:20,719
many gallons of water were applied to

410
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,560
the room which plants were sprayed uh

411
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,320
we're supposed to write down either like

412
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:26,479
all plants in room a which is how we

413
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,079
used to do it or the plant tag numbers

414
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,079
but you've got to write down a lot of

415
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:31,919
information the time the date the

416
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:33,439
re-entry time

417
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:35,759
all of that stuff is going to be written

418
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,519
down i recommend you write that down now

419
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:39,679
just get yourself in the habit of

420
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:41,440
writing that stuff down now while you're

421
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:43,439
writing down what you foliar sprayed

422
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,120
maybe consider writing down what you

423
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,399
were trying to correct what was your

424
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:50,560
reason for spraying this particular mix

425
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:52,879
why did you mix up this much of your

426
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:54,479
base nutrients and a dash of calmag and

427
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:56,799
spray that on your plants today what was

428
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,240
your goal did you see something wrong or

429
00:14:56,799 --> 00:15:00,078
were you trying to boost them were you

430
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,680
just trying to give them a little push

431
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:04,078
uh we'll talk about push in a moment

432
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:06,399
because that's one of my favorite foliar

433
00:15:04,078 --> 00:15:07,838
feeding products also i feed

434
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:09,519
what's the other one liquid karma and

435
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:11,920
push are my two favorites to follow your

436
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:14,399
feed also you'll see me fold your feet a

437
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:16,958
lot of calmac but let's keep going

438
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,559
i recommend a pump sprayer they sell

439
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:20,319
pump sprayers and a lot of different

440
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:22,078
sizes you don't want to be in there with

441
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,079
a little spray bottle like you're doing

442
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:25,679
the windows that will kill your wrist if

443
00:15:24,078 --> 00:15:27,359
you've got more than one plant your

444
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:29,439
wrist is going to die

445
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,680
invest in the appropriate size pump

446
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,680
sprayer to get the best application you

447
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:35,679
can those little deck sprayers or

448
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:37,359
pesticide sprayers that they sell at

449
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:39,198
your local hardware shop if you've got a

450
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,120
small mom-and-pop shop i recommend you

451
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:43,120
go there if not they've got them at the

452
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,560
orange box shop or the blue box shop at

453
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,320
home depot and lowe's has got you

454
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:48,078
covered get one of those pump sprayers

455
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,839
it's like a gallon maybe two gallons of

456
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:51,679
water you don't have to fill it you can

457
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:54,560
put one gallon in there but enough

458
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:56,319
nutrients to full your feed one gallon

459
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:58,078
do your feeding application and then

460
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,680
clean it out don't leave that pump

461
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:01,519
sprayer sitting there with old

462
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:03,679
pesticides old nutrients in there it's

463
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,278
gonna get moldy it will get funky then

464
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:06,559
you're gonna apply mold to your plants

465
00:16:05,278 --> 00:16:09,120
the next time you use it take care of

466
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:10,958
your [ __ ] buy it one time clean it every

467
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,120
time you use it it should last quite a

468
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:14,958
while the rings on there stay well

469
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,480
a little note when you are buying those

470
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:18,319
pump sprayers

471
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,720
this is [ __ ] random but it will help

472
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:24,879
you out i prefer the pump sprayer that

473
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:26,160
has a pressure release valve uh let's

474
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:27,919
let's talk about what's going to happen

475
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:29,679
we're going to get a pump sprayer you're

476
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:31,198
going to put the amount of water which

477
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:33,359
you'd like to put in there one or two

478
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:36,319
gallons maybe less maybe more we're

479
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:38,000
going to add our nutrients our pesticide

480
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,360
then we're going to put our surfactant

481
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,879
then we're going to ph it then we're

482
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,159
going to shake the [ __ ] out of it that's

483
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:44,720
one thing to always think about when

484
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:46,000
using any sort of spray application

485
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,480
shake it make sure you've got that

486
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,399
emulsified in that container so you're

487
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,759
not just applying uh like imagine if the

488
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,278
kool-aid was real thick at the bottom

489
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:54,959
and you just drank the top half you'd be

490
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:57,198
mad when everybody got to the bottom

491
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:59,198
without you so mix it up real good shake

492
00:16:57,198 --> 00:17:02,159
the [ __ ] out of it then we're gonna pump

493
00:16:59,198 --> 00:17:04,078
it real good uh 25 pumps or something

494
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:05,359
like that on the big ones uh 12 or

495
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:07,119
something pumps on the little ones is

496
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:08,078
what it recommends on the label so we're

497
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:10,558
going to pump it to where it's going to

498
00:17:08,078 --> 00:17:11,838
have good pressure to spray real hard at

499
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:13,439
this point i recommend you've already

500
00:17:11,838 --> 00:17:15,438
got gloves and goggles on we should have

501
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:17,439
mentioned that before always wear your

502
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,400
personal protective equipment when

503
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,000
mixing

504
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,839
shaking applying messing with the

505
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,160
pesticides or the foliar feeds you can

506
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:25,759
get in your eye it's going to suck wear

507
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,360
your personal protective equipment

508
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:29,200
that's a note from ross to jeff so we're

509
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:30,959
going to shake it up right shake the

510
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,480
[ __ ] out of it shake shake shake it up

511
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,519
baby now then we're going to spray the

512
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,480
plants

513
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:38,639
now it's time to clean our sprayer

514
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,720
but we didn't use all the charge from

515
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,480
the pump and i want to let off that

516
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,798
pressure but i don't want to stand there

517
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,240
and spray my pesticide or my foliar feed

518
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:47,918
into the air because the plants are

519
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,839
sprayed i don't want to spray into the

520
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:52,160
toilet down the drain what am i going to

521
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:54,399
do to let that pressure off i like a a

522
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,919
spray bottle or a sprayer that's got the

523
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,320
pressure release valve so that when i

524
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:00,480
unscrew that top valve it doesn't blast

525
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:02,960
off into my face you can simply let some

526
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,798
of the pressure off unscrew it and not

527
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,640
break your pump sprayer i think it'll

528
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:08,319
make it last longer they're not much

529
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,720
more expensive so i think it will be

530
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:13,038
worth the small investment you can find

531
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,480
those i recommend always go to a local

532
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:16,240
mom-and-pop shop that's the way we

533
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,640
should do it support mom and pop support

534
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,160
local shops if you don't support them

535
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,000
when you do need them they won't be

536
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,840
there they'll tell you order from amazon

537
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,519
bro and then amazon doesn't have any

538
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:27,038
advice or guidance so go to the mom and

539
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:28,960
pop shop help them out their guidance

540
00:18:27,038 --> 00:18:30,400
and advice their interaction will be

541
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,480
worth the extra couple bucks again if

542
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,720
they're not available hit that lows the

543
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:37,279
home depot they've always got sprayers

544
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:39,038
over in the uh the pesticide area

545
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:41,200
they've got that big gross pesticide

546
00:18:39,038 --> 00:18:43,200
section there you can find some useful

547
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,640
things pick up a package of mosquito

548
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,960
dunks while you're there i just did the

549
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:49,120
dave letterman [ __ ] johnny carson

550
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,038
phone uh pinpoint i call this a phone

551
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:53,439
also that [ __ ] that's a brain injury

552
00:18:51,038 --> 00:18:54,558
ah but there we go get some skeeter

553
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,080
dunks while you're there that's a

554
00:18:54,558 --> 00:18:58,319
presidential point if i ever seen one

555
00:18:56,079 --> 00:19:00,079
the obama point um

556
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:02,159
mosquito dunks come in handy for a lot

557
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:03,918
of things we can mix those up in our our

558
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:07,360
regular feed and put those in the water

559
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:08,960
and get rid of a lot of basic soil borne

560
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:10,479
pests let me get back on track get

561
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,000
yourself a good sprayer while you're at

562
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,919
the the store there get some skeeter

563
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,839
dunks they're good for you get something

564
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:18,320
that makes small bubbles i don't

565
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:19,839
necessarily use a fogger uh but get

566
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:21,759
something that makes the best small

567
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:24,879
bubbles you can find and again

568
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:27,119
use a mask and goggles and gloves when

569
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:29,280
you're doing any sort of spray

570
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:31,519
application remember if you put any

571
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:33,839
pesticides in here let's talk about this

572
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:36,000
you can foliar feed and apply a

573
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:37,279
pesticide application at the same time

574
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,480
i've mentioned this a couple of times

575
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:40,639
before

576
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,480
my favorite foliar feeding product is

577
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,400
push that is from

578
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,960
the veg bloom company which is actually

579
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:49,519
hydroponic research.com it's hydroponic

580
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:51,600
dash research.com to the best of my

581
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:53,359
recollection that is where i remember

582
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:54,719
finding that and buying that things

583
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:57,119
change on the internet that may be

584
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,640
totally different by now but push from

585
00:19:57,119 --> 00:20:01,439
the people that make veg bloom is a

586
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:04,240
great product i will add push in with

587
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:06,720
other products and pesticides

588
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:09,120
it would not be uncommon for me to add

589
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:11,279
push calmag and a little bit of

590
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:13,038
evergreen and possibly one more

591
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:14,798
pesticide let's just pick one i don't

592
00:20:13,038 --> 00:20:16,558
want to even imagine i don't have my

593
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:18,558
notes in front of me we'd pick another

594
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:20,558
pesticide and mix it right on in there

595
00:20:18,558 --> 00:20:22,480
so you're getting your calmag fixed

596
00:20:20,558 --> 00:20:24,000
you're getting a good push of a boost

597
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,079
and you're getting two pesticide

598
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,599
applications at once attacking from

599
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:30,798
multiple angles to get rid of those

600
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:32,639
pests um that is okay to do in my

601
00:20:30,798 --> 00:20:34,400
experience maybe make small batches

602
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,559
before you go hard and spray everything

603
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,559
and test it out but in most of my

604
00:20:36,558 --> 00:20:40,720
experience i can mix pesticides and

605
00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:42,720
foliar feeds at the same time when

606
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,079
you're doing that personal protective

607
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,319
equipment i keep saying that that's on

608
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:47,918
my notes here in capital bold letters

609
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:49,759
ppe i don't want to be the one

610
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:51,120
responsible for getting you sick or

611
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:53,519
injured i want to make sure you set

612
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:55,759
yourself up for success part of success

613
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:57,918
is setting yourself up for the long run

614
00:20:55,759 --> 00:21:00,640
by taking good care of yourself with

615
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:03,360
personal protective equipment

616
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:05,440
all right there will be a humidity spike

617
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:06,959
after any sort of spray be prepared for

618
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,880
that keep an eye on that on your

619
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,038
equipment maybe learn to adjust the fans

620
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,440
and the blowers to take care of that

621
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:15,440
humidity spike also you may have to dump

622
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,840
the humidifier early because there will

623
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,840
be more water in the air i've said this

624
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:21,839
before if there are no buds your

625
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:25,839
pesticide and foliar applications will

626
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:28,158
be just fine if you do have buds spray

627
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:30,798
lightly only spray if you've got a

628
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:31,919
reason don't just spray because it's fun

629
00:21:30,798 --> 00:21:34,319
because you heard of a foliar

630
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:36,799
application idea that looked cool spray

631
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:39,200
with purpose and intent or it will cause

632
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:40,558
problems but it can correct a lot of

633
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,960
things you're applying nutrients

634
00:21:40,558 --> 00:21:45,759
directly to the leaf where you see an

635
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,600
issue you'll be amazed at how quickly

636
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:49,279
if you've got a light issue so if those

637
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:51,199
spider mites have been sucking the life

638
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:53,599
out of your plants put a touch of base

639
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,600
nutrients in with your pesticide your

640
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:58,158
spider mite spray i'm going to say

641
00:21:55,599 --> 00:22:00,079
evergreen and a little bit of calmag and

642
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:02,720
a little bit of base nutrients together

643
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:04,798
after a spider mite infestation you'll

644
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,319
be wiping out the bugs and replenishing

645
00:22:04,798 --> 00:22:07,918
the nutrients at the same time you'll go

646
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:10,079
in and the leaves won't be green or

647
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:12,080
yellow and funky they'll be green and

648
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:13,599
healthy again it'll be amazing all right

649
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:15,839
i'm going over the notes making sure i

650
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:17,359
covered all of the notes on the ipad

651
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:18,879
then we're going to stare at the the

652
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:21,119
computer paper here for a moment make

653
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,039
sure we got all of those uh this

654
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:25,519
