something called the moon tower let's

76
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,879

77
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:50,639
tower the parents of the moon tower are

78
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:54,079
a pre-98 bubba kush female pollinated by

79
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:55,919
my arise male who is also known as king

80
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,159
solomon let's talk briefly about the

81
00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:00,158
bubba kush then we'll focus a little bit

82
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:02,560
on solomon then we will move deeply into

83
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:04,799
talking about the moon tower so the

84
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,560
pre-98 bubba kush the female plant that

85
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,159
makes up this cross

86
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,400
i like that plant i've loved that plant

87
00:03:08,158 --> 00:03:12,639
for a long time since uh medical

88
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,640
cannabis got popular i've been buying uh

89
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:16,559
bubba kush pre-98 bubba kush from

90
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:18,479
dispensaries from friends

91
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,560
from any type of grower i can find it

92
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:22,238
from forever i've had the clone a few

93
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,680
times i've uh when i get cloned

94
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,200
sometimes i work with them i breed to

95
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,360
them and i let them go or i grow them

96
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:28,719
for my own personal consumption and then

97
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,400
i'm limited to so many plants so

98
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:32,400
sometimes i'll just let things go over

99
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,640
the years i've gotten my hands on bubba

100
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,120
several times and i've let it go

101
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:39,919
i've always loved the coffee flavors the

102
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,519
earthy uh the dirty kind of notes and

103
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:44,238
tones and flavors and aromas that it

104
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,959
creates i love that i also love the buzz

105
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,560
it gives me a really nice uh heavy eyed

106
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,400
buzz a lot of strains now that i smoke

107
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,719
give me like an open bug-eyed kind of a

108
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,920
thing the bubba kush makes my eyes a

109
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:55,840
little bit heavy it makes me a little

110
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:57,598
bit lazy it makes my shoulders kind of

111
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,959
relax a little bit it makes me sit back

112
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:01,039
in the chair instead of the edge of the

113
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,560
chair which is where i usually am

114
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:04,479
so i love the bubba kush because it's

115
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,239
got that kind of couch lock feeling it

116
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:07,759
almost sits me down i'm a hyperactive

117
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,120
dude you could tell me the way i'm

118
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:10,798
talking [ __ ] a million miles an hour

119
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,640
right here under the microphone

120
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,719
but i go super quickly when i smoke the

121
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:16,319
bubba kush it will chill me out it's

122
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:17,358
good for nighttime smoke for me it's

123
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:18,879
good for if i'm hanging out with the

124
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:20,879
lady and i'm too talkative and she wants

125
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:22,399
to watch a movie smoke that bubba kush

126
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:24,319
it'll calm me right down get into the

127
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:26,319
mood for a movie if i got to do some

128
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:27,680
emails or some work and i'm too hyper

129
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:29,759
that will chill me out so i love the

130
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,079
bubba kush that couch lock

131
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,080
relaxation plus the coffee the dirt the

132
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:35,758
earthy tones beautiful beautiful

133
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:37,680
cannabis it grows very well there's not

134
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,960
a problem with the way it grows it grows

135
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,959
like a kush it grows a little bit

136
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:42,799
stretchy it could be better but there's

137
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:46,399
not a huge problem with the way that it

138
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:50,240
grows now let's talk about king solomon

139
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:52,159
king solomon again as an f1 male f1

140
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,439
let's say that again king solomon is an

141
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:57,360
arise f1 male so i crossed the golden

142
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:59,519
goat and daybreaker was a golden goat

143
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,360
female a daybreaker male put that

144
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:04,000
daybreaker male pollen on the golden

145
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,879
goat that made my arise from that first

146
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,399
batch of seeds i found a dude that is

147
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:10,079
he's a stud he's a winner he's a

148
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:12,239
champion he's proven himself to be a

149
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:13,918
winner because i've crossed him to

150
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,079
hundreds of females probably we'll say

151
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:17,918
at least 100 females and i've grown

152
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:20,000
probably 70 of them or somebody's grown

153
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:23,198
70 of them and they all

154
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,038
probably say 60 to 65 of them were quite

155
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,280
stellar they do perform quite well so

156
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:28,560
king solomon is a stud there are a few

157
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:29,839
that don't work super great some of

158
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,280
those won't be released some of them

159
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:33,918
aren't amazing but that's not the point

160
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:36,159
here let's focus on king solomon

161
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:38,478
when i breed with king solomon i know

162
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,160
that he is going to improve anything

163
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:42,319
that i put his pollen on he will make

164
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,320
things more more potent he will make

165
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:46,240
things grow with more vigor he seems to

166
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:47,839
be the improver or the fixer plant is

167
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,000
what i know him as

168
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:52,159
once again he is a golden goat female

169
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,918
pollinated by a daybreaker male let's

170
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,840
talk briefly about daybreaker because

171
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:59,279
that will come into play here uh

172
00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:01,839
daybreaker is a chem d to joseph og

173
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:04,638
cross you got that chem dog the chemd

174
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:06,560
that like cushy chemical sort of a smell

175
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,879
over here and joseph og which is like

176
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,560
swampy uh just cushy if you know what

177
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:12,560
kush smells like it's straight up kush

178
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,959
that is what kush smells like so you got

179
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,959
joseph you got kim and then they cross

180
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:18,959
that and then i put that to the golden

181
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:22,000
goat so that gave us kind of a sweet

182
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:25,120
cushy chem dirty feet sweet feet sort of

183
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,279
a flavor so somebody took the chem d and

184
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,120
crossed it to the joseph og that made

185
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:31,758
the daybreaker i took the daybreaker

186
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:34,639
mail pollinated the golden go female

187
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:37,439
that made sort of a tropical fruit sweet

188
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:39,840
cushy dirty feet aroma sort of a plant

189
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:42,399
those plants were labeled arise from

190
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:44,079
that batch of seeds was a male who's

191
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:46,560
been labeled solomon that is king

192
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:50,159
solomon he grows with those sweet kimmy

193
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:52,319
flavors aromas hyper vigor super potency

194
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,400
and he's also resistant to problems he

195
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,560
can handle a lot of stress

196
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:58,000
so why did i want to cross these two

197
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,079
plants that's always important i say

198
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,478
when you're breeding have a goal have

199
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:04,399
something in mind honestly

200
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:06,240
uh the thing that really got me excited

201
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:07,839
about this was these are two of my

202
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,280
favorite strains i've always loved the

203
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:11,679
bubba kush it's been a favorite of mine

204
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:13,119
for quite a while i've always loved king

205
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,120
solomon obviously he's done a lot of

206
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,800
great work for me i had an opportunity

207
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,800
put that to put them both in the same

208
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,960
area and breed to them and i thought why

209
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,478
would i miss this opportunity then as i

210
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:24,079
was doing it i thought what am i going

211
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:26,478
to create here and i thought i wanted to

212
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:28,879
create that i wanted to keep the coffee

213
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:30,478
and earth flavor add some sweetener to

214
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:33,279
it just a little bit of sweetness to it

215
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:35,120
but then try to hype up the growth time

216
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:36,559
because the rise grows super quickly to

217
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,560
where it cuts down the veg time with

218
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,160
some plants when i breed it to things it

219
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,038
veges more quickly so i was hoping to

220
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,439
make the

221
00:07:41,038 --> 00:07:45,120
bubba kush veg more quickly and keep

222
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:47,360
that sweet kush flavor add a little

223
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,598
sweetness to it at the same time add a

224
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,680
little bit of potency was honestly my

225
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:53,680
main goal the main idea when making this

226
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,000
cross so

227
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:59,120
the results actually were i wrote this

228
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,319
down coffee earth fuel and funk flavors

229
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,879
and then we get

230
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:05,520
medium height plants with tight internal

231
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:07,280
spacing and long lateral branching that

232
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:08,639
means that the plants in my opinion in

233
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:10,878
my experience what i've seen from

234
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,280
testers is the plants they'll grow kind

235
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,960
of tall but the internodal spacing will

236
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:16,959
be tight together and those branches

237
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:18,560
that come from those nodes get really

238
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:21,519
really long as something that i'm

239
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,839
noticing so we've got medium height

240
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:25,519
plants with tight internal spacing and

241
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:26,959
long lateral branching now we're kind of

242
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:28,878
talking about how it grows in its growth

243
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:31,598
structures and features moved on from

244
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:33,440
that uh flavor and aroma profile talking

245
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:35,519
more about the grow features if you

246
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,839
don't top these plants or uh yeah if you

247
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,519
don't top them they will make one giant

248
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:40,959
cola they'll make one big butts you'll

249
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,278
get a lot of branching coming up it'll

250
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:45,278
make a lot of nice side buds but then

251
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:47,360
you'll get one big donkey dick bud right

252
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:49,200
up the middle if you don't top it if you

253
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,519
do top it it'll make it spread out i

254
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,440
recommend topping low a lot of people

255
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,278
top when there's that one v section

256
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,399
that's only a few inches apart go down

257
00:08:55,278 --> 00:09:00,320
one or two more nodes lower top it there

258
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,839
veg a little bit longer let it recover

259
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,000
let it kind of even out a little bit

260
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:07,200
then you'll get a lot more from it in my

261
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,039
experience with this plant so um

262
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:12,320
they take off they stretch early in

263
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:14,319
flowers some phenotypes will double in

264
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,399
height before they are done a lot of

265
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,080
phenotypes have the potential to become

266
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,600
double in height before they are done

267
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,000
flowering so if you've got a two foot

268
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,920
flowering space flower at a foot allow

269
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,278
for pot space allow for light space but

270
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:27,519
you understand what i'm saying if you

271
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:29,759
flower at 12 inches they will finish at

272
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:32,720
24 inches so be prepared for that sort

273
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:34,639
of a thing they do take off and stretch

274
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,240
a little bit in early flower that is

275
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:38,159
something i recommend you be prepared

276
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,639
for if you were growing up the moon

277
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:42,958
tower it will get stretchy for you early

278
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:44,480
in flower so be prepared some of those

279
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:46,079
phenotypes are going to get tall we'll

280
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,278
talk about how to take care of that here

281
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,519
in just a little bit i do have some

282
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:51,120
notes i should try to stay on track of

283
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,399
let's talk about phenotypes let's see

284
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,480
some of the phenotypes that i'm

285
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:57,600
experiencing and that test growers have

286
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:59,759
seen through the populations of moon

287
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,680
tower i see a structure the same

288
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:03,439
structure across most of these plants it

289
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:05,120
is the same shape the same structure

290
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,200
that is happening in most environments

291
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,278
and from most phenotypes

292
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,680
they get tall and they've got that long

293
00:10:09,278 --> 00:10:13,120
branchy structure the main differences

294
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:15,359
i'm seeing the main difference in

295
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,639
structure that i'm seeing is depending

296
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,879
on your light depending on your

297
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:20,720
environment people are getting a

298
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:22,159
different stretch space in that

299
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,079
internode spacing if you don't have a

300
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:26,240
lot of light if you pack the plants in

301
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:28,000
too closely also if you put them in too

302
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,680
small of a pot and they get root bound

303
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,759
they do get a little more stretchy but

304
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:33,838
when all things are good when the lights

305
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:36,000
the air water soil the spacing is all

306
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:38,399
correct they do stay pretty squat not

307
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,559
squat they stay tight not squat tight is

308
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:42,559
the word the node spacing is tight so

309
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:44,879
that's something i've noticed ah that

310
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:47,119
one tall structure is very common they

311
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:49,679
get long branches the long branches

312
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,839
however do fill in with giant colas they

313
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:53,359
will also need support i recommend a

314
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,560
support for the top if you leave it

315
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,800
there a lot of people are going to cut

316
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:59,359
it out but i do recommend supports for

317
00:10:56,799 --> 00:11:01,359
the taller branches i like a trellis net

318
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,278
trellis makes it super easy for me to do

319
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,720
what i like to do in the grow some of

320
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:06,799
you like to move the plants around that

321
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,320
may not work for you i may recommend

322
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:09,439
sticks but be careful the sticks will

323
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,360
get in your eye

324
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,800
those are dangerous maybe a tomato cage

325
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,680
is better for you there are a lot of

326
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:17,679
ways to do that but a trellis net is my

327
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:19,599
ideal situation sometimes i use three

328
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:21,439
nets of trellis in a commercial

329
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,519
environment uh so the plants start

330
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,120
growing up as soon as they start growing

331
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,799
toward that trellis i'll top them and

332
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,320
then spread them out let them grow into

333
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:30,000
it they'll get a little bit taller up

334
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,600
i'll spread them out a little bit more

335
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,278
that third one is just to guide those

336
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,440
buds straight up to the sky to where

337
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:37,600
they know where to go then i defoliate

338
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,440
everything below that first net of

339
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,440
trellis three layers in a commercial

340
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:44,399
grow now the main things you guys will

341
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:47,600
see in my experience of differences in

342
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:49,440
phenotypes is going to be leaf shape and

343
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,680
bud structure now that's going to be the

344
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,760
most obvious visual determination of

345
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:56,958
different phenotypes now that skinnier

346
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:58,159
leafino in my opinion is like kush and

347
00:11:56,958 --> 00:12:01,759
coffee that's kind of what i was

348
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:03,919
breeding for it's got that kush earthy

349
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:06,319
coffee flavor but then it's also got

350
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:08,078
that kush buzz that like sets you down

351
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,760
chills you out but then there's also

352
00:12:08,078 --> 00:12:11,838
something in it that's got some caffeine

353
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:13,600
or some energy to it it's like i'd like

354
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:15,360
to sit here and [ __ ] around but i gotta

355
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,360
go do something but i'm so high i'm not

356
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,200
sure what i'm supposed to do kind of

357
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,120
gives me that feeling i like it a lot of

358
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,200
people it may drive you crazy it's got

359
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,919
some motivation to it it's got some kick

360
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,600
and some arise intensity to it the kush

361
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:28,799
buzz comes through most of the

362
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,399
phenotypes you're going to get that

363
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:32,078
cushy feeling that like chilled out

364
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:33,759
relaxed sort of a feeling that's going

365
00:12:32,078 --> 00:12:35,919
to come through most of the phenotypes

366
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:37,278
those skinnier leaf phenotypes however

367
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:39,439
are going to have a little bit of a head

368
00:12:37,278 --> 00:12:41,360
ring to them possibly a little bit of a

369
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:44,639
caffeinated feeling to it that does come

370
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,240
from the golden goat side of things now

371
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,799
the bud structure on some will be

372
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:52,079
tighter than others in my opinion

373
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:54,240
the less dense phenotypes are excellent

374
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:55,759
for concentrate makers if you don't have

375
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,919
that super tight bud i think you can

376
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:59,600
make a better concentrate i believe the

377
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:02,319
dense buds are great for bag appeal and

378
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:04,399
smoking but extracting in my opinion my

379
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,639
experience from what my friends tell me

380
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:08,559
extracting a less dense product is

381
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:10,159
easier uh there's more room for

382
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:12,159
trichomes on that so if you got like a

383
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:13,838
bud that's kind of airy kind of fingery

384
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:15,278
imagine if we took a kush nugget that's

385
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:17,120
super tight and like a haze nugget

386
00:13:15,278 --> 00:13:19,439
that's got fingers and we rolled them

387
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,799
both around in powdered sugar i'm sure

388
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,959
showing my hands to the camera for

389
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:24,639
everybody that's listening on spotify or

390
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:26,719
anywhere else if you look at my two

391
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,480
hands i got a fist how much i can cover

392
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,200
my fist the outer of my fist with

393
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,720
powdered sugar if i i'm sweaty if i open

394
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,480
up my hand i got the inside of my hand

395
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,040
between my fingers all of this i can

396
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,320
coat in powdered sugar or trichomes if

397
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:39,919
that were a nugget so i believe

398
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,839
sometimes if you're growing for

399
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:44,319
concentrates sometimes those more airy

400
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:46,639
fingery buds are good for the

401
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,959
concentrate making so the tighter buds

402
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:51,278
obviously are more cush leaning those

403
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:54,078
come from more of the cush chem side of

404
00:13:51,278 --> 00:13:56,799
the genetics the more fingery buds are

405
00:13:54,078 --> 00:13:59,359
more from the golden goat the romulan

406
00:13:56,799 --> 00:14:01,439
the hawaiian sativa side of the genetics

407
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:04,159
in there those are going to be more of

408
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,480
the the head ringer the head buzz the

409
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:08,078
psychedelic feeling the where where the

410
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,519
hell are my keys while i'm driving my

411
00:14:08,078 --> 00:14:12,078
car where are my sunglasses while

412
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:13,759
they're on my face i lost my phone while

413
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:16,958
i'm playing on instagram that kind of a

414
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:19,919
buzz uh those come from the skinnier

415
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:22,000
leaf shape buds that feeling is going to

416
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:23,838
come from those long skinny leaves and

417
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
kind of even the more airy bud so the

418
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:28,000
longer and skinnier the leaf the more

419
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,078
airy the bud of course the more head

420
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,278
ringer of a buzz i believe you're going

421
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:35,599
to get from those plants so use that

422
00:14:33,278 --> 00:14:37,439
leaf shape use that leave of that bud

423
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,680
density to help you determine kind of

424
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,920
which phenotype that you have got but

425
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:43,919
most importantly the most important part

426
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:45,599
when it comes to phenotype selection i

427
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:46,719
talk a lot about which phenotypes you

428
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,560
will see i'm telling you you're gonna

429
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,800
see one with long skinny leaves one with

430
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:52,078
a little bit wider leaf one with tight

431
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:53,838
tight buds one that's a little bit

432
00:14:52,078 --> 00:14:56,479
fluffier then you're gonna get different

433
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:58,800
combos of those buds and leaves together

434
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:01,199
but it doesn't matter to me which

435
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:02,879
phenotype you find that may sound rude

436
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:04,639
as long as you find the one that works

437
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:06,240
the best for you i've described a lot of

438
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,839
phenos and then people email me they're

439
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,919
like how do i find the phenotype that

440
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:11,519
you call the mean girl how do i find the

441
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:13,679
phenotype that you called the fat girl

442
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:15,360
how do i find that and i say just grow

443
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:16,879
it and honestly look for the best

444
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,959
phenotype in your garden you don't have

445
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:21,120
to have the one that i like the most

446
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:22,719
i like weed that makes me [ __ ] panic

447
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,560
attack while i'm sitting at a table by

448
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,160
myself i like to just freak myself out

449
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:28,159
by taking a dab like oh [ __ ] what's

450
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:30,000
going on that's my favorite feeling that

451
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:31,519
might not be for you you might want to

452
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,120
smoke and lay down and take a nap that's

453
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,679
not what i'm trying to do so find the

454
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,839
phenotype that does the thing that you

455
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:39,359
need done from it the one that grows the

456
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,959
best in your garden you've got to grow

457
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,199
it you got to manage it you're going to

458
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:45,838
have it for nine weeks in flower

459
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:47,519
four-ish six-ish weeks and veg two weeks

460
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:50,560
is a clone you're dealing with this

461
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:52,720
plant for [ __ ] 15 16 20 weeks 120

462
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:55,198
days ish make sure it's something you

463
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,959
want to grow again um also find the

464
00:15:55,198 --> 00:15:58,479
phenotype that is something you want to

465
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:59,838
smoke or if you're selling it or

466
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,680
profiting from it or using it as

467
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:03,199
medicine make sure it's the thing that

468
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:04,559
works for that so

469
00:16:03,198 --> 00:16:06,559
choose the one that works for you in

470
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:08,159
your environment for your wallet for

471
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:10,000
your budget for your clientele whatever

472
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:11,278
you need it to that may be a totally

473
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,799
different phenotype than me i'm not

474
00:16:11,278 --> 00:16:14,879
worried about making money off of the

475
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:16,319
flowers i grow i'm going to smoke all of

476
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:18,559
them or i'm going to pollinate them and

477
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,959
make seeds so my grow and your grow are

478
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:23,359
focused on two totally different things

479
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:25,838
find the phenotype that works the best

480
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:28,000
for you now i'm going to go back talking

481
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:30,399
about phenotypes because there is one

482
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,839
one anomaly out of i talk about most of

483
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:33,440
them are going to get tall most of them

484
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:36,000
have that long branching most of them

485
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:38,000
have tight internal spacing there is one

486
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
however that just loves to [ __ ] with you

487
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,039
because that's how genetics work that is

488
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,559
a short squat runt looking plant it

489
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:46,480
doesn't look desirable it doesn't look

490
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:48,638
like it's going to be any good it looks

491
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,800
like it's going to suck but if you

492
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:53,839
finish that plant out and flower it and

493
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:55,278
let it go its full 67 72-ish day term

494
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,839
that it needs to go

495
00:16:55,278 --> 00:17:00,000
that plant will punch you in the face

496
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:02,800
like mike tyson it is like cinder blocks

497
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,400
to the head it is like cement shoes it's

498
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:06,480
like i don't know it's like some sort of

499
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:09,360
medicine it will put you down that [ __ ]

500
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:11,599
will just lay you out it is such good

501
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:13,678
medicine but you don't get a lot of it

502
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:15,918
it doesn't look pretty it smells like

503
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:18,400
dirty ass skunks and it takes you two

504
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:19,280
hits to go full [ __ ] from smoking it

505
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,798
but

506
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:22,480
you don't get a lot of it and it doesn't

507
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:24,240
look super good so if you're growing it

508
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,400
just for yourself if you just want to

509
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,640
smoke it for you there's a little shitty

510
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,080
rump plant that may pop up in a pack of

511
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,000
i don't know i found it like two or

512
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:33,839
three times out of a lot of seeds not a

513
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,919
lot of the testers have reported it but

514
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:37,599
if you get that one finish it out get a

515
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,960
clone of it it's hard to get a clone

516
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:40,879
because it stays so little it doesn't

517
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,480
grow very big you gotta veg it for a

518
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,400
real long time and treat it like a baby

519
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,640
but the medicine that comes from that

520
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,080
the buds from that it is worth the extra

521
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,600
effort and the work if you're gonna sell

522
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:51,119
it if you're doing a commercial grow

523
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:53,519
that's not the one for you if it's for

524
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:54,798
your bag for your head for your jar grow

525
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:56,160
that one if you've got it just over

526
00:17:54,798 --> 00:17:57,918
there in the corner of the room finish

527
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,160
that bad [ __ ] out because it is worth

528
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:02,160
it one time maybe don't take a clone

529
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,000
maybe just run it the one time see what

530
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,679
it does all right so we've talked about

531
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,599
the phenotypes we talked about terps

532
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:09,200
flavors i've talked a lot about the

533
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:11,678
feelings and buzz that this plant gives

534
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,519
me let's talk about a few of the grow

535
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:15,840
features and tips that i can give you

536
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:18,558
for this plant i really think that the

537
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:20,319
moon tower works very good in a screen

538
00:18:18,558 --> 00:18:22,399
of green environment when you trellis

539
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:24,480
them down with the net they enjoy that

540
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,080
they also work well in a sea of green

541
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:29,038
environment because they grow that one

542
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:30,639
big tall apical dominant cola if you veg

543
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:32,640
them until they're what is this what is

544
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,720
it eight ten inches tall if you veg them

545
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,080
to about ten inches tall cut off all the

546
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,319
bottom branching and flip them you'll

547
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:40,079
just end up with a bunch of nice main

548
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:41,439
colas you gotta run a lot of them real

549
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:43,279
close together of course if you're gonna

550
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,200
do that method don't expect a huge

551
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:47,038
harvest from each one that's when we do

552
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,519
a sea of green that's when you do like

553
00:18:47,038 --> 00:18:50,879
64 of them on a three by three table an

554
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:53,038
eight by eight square on a three by

555
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,720
three table lots of plants if you're in

556
00:18:53,038 --> 00:18:56,720
a state where your numbers are regulated

557
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:59,440
that is not the way to go but the plants

558
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:01,120
will enjoy doing that i always recommend

559
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,360
with the moon tower

560
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:04,479
cleaning up the branches but not

561
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:06,959
completely

562
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:09,038
removing the entire branch we do a lot a

563
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,400
lot of lollipopping we do a lot of leg

564
00:19:09,038 --> 00:19:12,240
shaving a lot of cleaning up of the

565
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,759
bottom of the plant in my school of

566
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,160
thought and my training camp in my

567
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:18,079
facilities in my grow however i wouldn't

568
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,320
cut off all of the branching at the

569
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:22,879
bottom of the moon tower i may leave

570
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:24,639
more branching than usual and instead of

571
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:27,200
cutting that off i would kind of strip

572
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:29,200
the bottom half or two thirds of that

573
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,720
branch just clean that right up to where

574
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,640
the bottom is naked you can see their

575
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,319
legs for a far way up but when you get

576
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,559
up to the top of the skirt you're just

577
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:38,798
going to grow big long buds leave a

578
00:19:36,558 --> 00:19:41,678
leave a nice section up at the top and

579
00:19:38,798 --> 00:19:43,359
have a naked tip or a naked naked leg

580
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:45,200
nice tip and that'll grow nice big

581
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:47,678
donkey buds at the end of that so clean

582
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,840
it up and then leave the end of it

583
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:52,000
enough at the end to make you a nice fat

584
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:53,759
cola all that space should fill in

585
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,679
generally a cush plant is going to make

586
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:57,759
a bunch of golf balls but what the arize

587
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,840
has done the rise makes that bud stack

588
00:19:57,759 --> 00:20:01,919
up a little bit better and fill in all

589
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:04,399
of that space another thing i should

590
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:06,000
mention don't over water the moon tower

591
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,480
plants they don't like being over

592
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,240
watered they may survive better if you

593
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,679
underwater them than they would if you

594
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,079
over water them that has been my

595
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:16,960
experience that's what i have noticed

596
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:18,639
they do eat moderately heavy so if you

597
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,960
are used to feeding a plant a certain

598
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,799
diet maybe step it up just a little bit

599
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,880
higher now let's talk about some of the

600
00:20:22,798 --> 00:20:25,839
things you may want to feed them

601
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,919
they do

602
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:29,599
love the cow mag and when you feed a cow

603
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:32,240
mag it makes the leaves kind of get the

604
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:33,759
serrations they they pop up a little bit

605
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:37,038
they love that and they look super good

606
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:38,319
for photos the plants do like a low ph

607
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:39,919
toward the end of flower that will

608
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:42,558
increase your colors once again help you

609
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:44,159
for photos low temps at night will help

610
00:20:42,558 --> 00:20:46,480
your photos make it change a little bit

611
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:49,360
of color they will tolerate that cold

612
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:51,839
quite well they do like kelp products

613
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:54,479
kelp products will help your flavors

614
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:56,959
aromas and bud density one thing i

615
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:59,038
noticed they responded very well to a

616
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:01,519
product called bud swell i fed them bud

617
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:03,599
swell they did exactly that they swole

618
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:05,918
up they got fat they got beefy so that

619
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:07,119
seemed to work one thing i want to

620
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,520
mention

621
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:11,519
these plants do have a tendency to just

622
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:14,558
go yellow around week eight right around

623
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:16,798
the end of week eight week day 56 day 59

624
00:21:14,558 --> 00:21:19,200
day 60 they're just going to go wonk and

625
00:21:16,798 --> 00:21:21,119
turn yellow on you don't be afraid that

626
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,080
is not a problem that is just a sign of

627
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:23,839
hey

628
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:25,439
we're done it's almost time to harvest

629
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:27,839
if you haven't started flushing if you

630
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:30,240
do that now it may be time to flush if

631
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:32,000
you do the 18 6 light switch now it may

632
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,200
be time to do that these plants are very

633
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,079
cool they let you know they're like hey

634
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,600
bro

635
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:37,119
we're almost done it's time to go ahead

636
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:38,879
and start wrapping it up get ready for

637
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:40,479
harvest time so if they turn yellow that

638
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,159
is fine i don't think you did anything

639
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,599
wrong that is a common issue that

640
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:45,600
happens with these plants i don't even

641
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:46,959
guess it's an issue that's just a trait

642
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:48,879
that happens within these plants it goes

643
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,000
hey bro time to cut us down and they let

644
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,440
you know the leaves will just turn

645
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,480
yellow some of the big leaves will fall

646
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,480
right off for you they start

647
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,159
pre-trimming themselves i've gotten that

648
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,839
report from a lot of test growers i've

649
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:00,240
seen it along a lot amongst a lot of

650
00:21:57,839 --> 00:22:01,599
phenotypes that i grew don't freak out

651
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,319
they're almost done and they're just

652
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:06,079
letting you know that it is almost time

653
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:07,759
for their haircut i'm scrolling through

654
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:08,960
my notes to see where i am

655
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:10,558
um

656
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,720
they did like the buds well i mentioned

657
00:22:10,558 --> 00:22:14,079
that they liked bud swell a lot they

658
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,240
really seemed to take well that bud

659
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:18,079
swell that organic bat guano liquid

660
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,640
nutrient made them swell up made them

661
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:22,079
get super beefy i watched them swell

662
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,840
i've grown a couple of batches of this

663
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:25,759
i've seen other people grow it people

664
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:28,879
that did not use bud swell did not get

665
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:30,319
the swell that i saw my plants get where

666
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,000
are we some of these plants can be

667
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:33,678
challenging to clone i'm not sure why

668
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,359
they don't like to clone well the pre-98

669
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:37,038
bubba kush clones well king solomon

670
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:39,119
clones well i don't know where the

671
00:22:37,038 --> 00:22:40,798
problematic cloning came from what i've

672
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:43,119
discovered what i've learned to realize

673
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:45,038
is if you don't feed these plants for

674
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:46,158
three to four days they will clone

675
00:22:45,038 --> 00:22:48,400
better so when you're going to take

676
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:49,919
clones of the of the moon tower make

677
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,840
sure the mother plant has been starved

678
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:53,919
for a couple of days this is common

679
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:55,519
amongst most cannabis plants if you over

680
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:57,840
feed them nitrogen if they're high in

681
00:22:55,519 --> 00:22:59,599
nitrogen when you cut clones it does

682
00:22:57,839 --> 00:23:01,599
slow down the rooting time so make them

683
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:04,158
a little bit hungry that will speed up

684
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:06,158
your rooting process everything else is

685
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:07,280
fairly easy they root well

686
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:08,880
they'll get kind of tall it's going to

687
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:10,798
be your main thing to think about you're

688
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:13,120
going to have to be prepared for tall

689
00:23:10,798 --> 00:23:14,240
plants but they should be fairly easy

690
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:16,000
for most growers you shouldn't

691
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,359
experience too much problems you

692
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,599
shouldn't get too much trouble don't

693
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:21,439
over water uh keep an eye on the feeding

694
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:24,319
everything should be cool feeder a

695
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:27,440
moderately high nitrogen diet so if you

696
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:29,519
feed your plants um however many ppms of

697
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,519
nitrogen now maybe increase that by 10

698
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:33,200
20 percent and pay attention to these

699
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:34,960
plants these plants are hungry [ __ ]

700
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,400
and they will eat i don't want to tell

701
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,679
you to super feed it because then you're

702
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,000
going to go pounding it with too much

703
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:42,240
nutrients here's something i would

704
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,679
recommend that you do consider this is

705
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,278
not instruction none of this is

706
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:47,840
instruction this is all recommendation

707
00:23:45,278 --> 00:23:49,679
from a friend here i would consider when

708
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:52,000
you flip to flour

709
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,759
so you go from your veg phase you turn

710
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,519
your lights to 12 12 you are now in

711
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:56,400
flower day one starts when you flip the

712
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:58,558
lights

713
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,320
most people will now switch to their

714
00:23:58,558 --> 00:24:02,480
from their vegetative to their flowering

715
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:04,639
nutrients at this time i would recommend

716
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,558
you go two more weeks with your

717
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,960
vegetative nutrients with this strain

718
00:24:06,558 --> 00:24:10,960
because these plants do eat a lot of

719
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,960
nitrogen and they will need that extra

720
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,798
nitrogen built up this will help you out

721
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,759
in my opinion this works for a lot of

722
00:24:14,798 --> 00:24:18,400
plants

723
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:20,720
maybe taper off that veg feed into your

724
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,720
bloom feed over the next two week period

725
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,720
but adjust that slowly don't just drop

726
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:27,440
off that nitrogen completely that's when

727
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:29,919
you will see problems

728
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:32,080
the moon tower does enjoy moderate

729
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:34,080
defoliation but don't overdo it i like

730
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:36,079
to defoliate plants i've learned that if

731
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:37,918
you over defoliate the moon tower she

732
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:40,879
will get a little bit pissy with you so

733
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:43,840
don't overdo it go lightly instead of

734
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:45,520
doing one fat defoliation uh over a

735
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:48,000
couple of weeks do a couple of light

736
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:50,158
defaults it will work better for you

737
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,919
i usually suggest popping and twisting

738
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,520
these plants to build structure and

739
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:55,278
mitigate stretch that is something i

740
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:57,599
recommend on most of my plants i got a

741
00:24:55,278 --> 00:24:59,919
few cultivars that don't react well to

742
00:24:57,599 --> 00:25:01,038
it but the moon tower responds well if

743
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:02,559
you don't know what i'm talking about

744
00:25:01,038 --> 00:25:04,558
i've done a full episode on popping and

745
00:25:02,558 --> 00:25:06,000
twisting i basically grab the plant with

746
00:25:04,558 --> 00:25:07,839
two hands and give it a twist in

747
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,599
different directions and it goes

748
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:11,359
like pop in a knuckle and it makes the

749
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:13,038
plant break the cellulose fiber right

750
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:14,879
there and it will rebuild a little

751
00:25:13,038 --> 00:25:17,200
knuckle it looks a little bit knurled

752
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,799
might be the word it makes it stronger

753
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,159
it also slows down so it's going to make

754
00:25:18,798 --> 00:25:21,759
it stronger right there it can support

755
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,278
itself a little bit better more

756
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:25,440
nutrients can flow through a thicker

757
00:25:23,278 --> 00:25:27,359
stem also that will slow down the

758
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,440
vertical stretch so they're not growing

759
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:31,599
as quickly through that phase it'll slow

760
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,960
that down and make them stronger one

761
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:34,879
thing i think really helps with these

762
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:37,200
plants is keep the ph consistent they

763
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:39,200
seem to like that consistent ph

764
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,960
ph swings ph jumps they get a little bit

765
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,278
out of control of course medium does

766
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:45,600
matter uh they really will like

767
00:25:43,278 --> 00:25:48,240
consistent ph i mentioned before they

768
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:50,639
like cow mag they really enjoy kelp and

769
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,558
these plants responded a week six we hit

770
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,159
them with bud swell they went [ __ ]

771
00:25:52,558 --> 00:25:56,240
kaboom so hit em with that bud swell

772
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:58,080
they should be happy i'd want to remind

773
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,519
you don't panic if they turn yellow

774
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:01,359
close to the end that is called

775
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:03,200
senescence they are starting to they're

776
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:04,959
just dying but they're still living keep

777
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,480
the buds going the leaves are going to

778
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:09,200
die we're going to cut off the leaves

779
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,960
anyway that is okay harvest of these

780
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:14,640
plants will generally be ready around

781
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:16,960
day 63 to day 67. i always recommend

782
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,880
going long for your first couple of runs

783
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,480
see what they do i told you when i hit

784
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:23,360
them with budswell they really swelled

785
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:25,440
up maybe if you let them go 74 75 days

786
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:27,199
they really might beef up at the end

787
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,798
there pay attention to the trichomes

788
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,159
that's really what matters let the

789
00:26:28,798 --> 00:26:31,918
plants finish

790
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:35,120
let the plants finish i do recommend

791
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:37,200
though at least 70 days 63 70 days is

792
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:39,519
ideal you will get outliers of course

793
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,880
there will be 60 day finishers i believe

794
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:42,720
that if you've got the right setup for

795
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,480
the moon tower you can get pretty fat

796
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,079
harvest from her if you clean up the

797
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,599
bottom of her give her that attention

798
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:48,960
she deserves make sure there's no junk

799
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:50,639
on the bottom no larf none of that

800
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,720
fluffy stuff none of that wasted buds

801
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:54,559
none of those mini shoots clean all that

802
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,558
[ __ ] up send all that energy up to the

803
00:26:54,558 --> 00:26:58,399
top spread it out get plenty of light

804
00:26:56,558 --> 00:26:59,839
down into the canopy with a good light

805
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,840
with the proper care with the right

806
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:04,959
airflow i predict that you could get

807
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:06,079
pretty fat harvest from the moon tower i

808
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,440
don't want to give you numbers i don't

809
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:09,359
want to set expectations i'm going to

810
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,679
say if you do it right and you put in

811
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:15,038

confused and i try to name stuff after

827
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:46,158
dazed and confused my buddy my buddy

830
00:27:48,398 --> 00:27:52,639
i've had moon tower written on us on a

831
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,880
strain name list for a long time i got a

832
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,480
document in my phone it is just strain

833
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,000

834
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:00,319
movie or whatever i get a strain name

835
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,759
idea type it down in the list then when

836
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:03,200
new strains come up we scroll through

837
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:04,798
and see if anything matches and if it

838
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,120
works out in my head moon tower was on

839
00:28:04,798 --> 00:28:08,720
the list for a long time i was in a chat

840
