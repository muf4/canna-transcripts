guys a uh lesson on how to set up a

48
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,640
Perpetual grow and I actually took a lot

49
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:55,798
of time and figured out how to do that I

50
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,079
think I've got it figured out for

51
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:59,640
you uh man my arms are a little bit

52
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:00,359

56
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:08,118
out of those drums and I needed that

57
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:09,719
that was kind of nice I haven't played

58
00:02:08,118 --> 00:02:11,840
the drums in quite a while I needed to

59
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:14,519
make some space where the drums were for

60
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,000
uh some grow things of course but then I

61
00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:18,200
had that space available set up a big uh

62
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,680

clouds shout out to the Mystic root crew

79
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:56,200
here we go uh so episode 73 scheduling a

80
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:58,000
Perpetual flow uh when you're scheduling

81
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:59,839
a Perpetual grow a few things you need

82
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,759
to keep in mind are things like You're

83
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,319
plant count if you're in a uh a medical

84
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:06,798
State like Colorado where I am you have

85
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:09,199
a plant count and you have to stay

86
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:10,799
within that to be legal this will be a

87
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:12,359
good way to help you stay within your

88
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:14,280
plant count and produce the amount of

89
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,440
medicine or recreational Cannabis you

90
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,360
need to supply

91
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:20,519
yourself so that's something you need to

92
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,159
think about uh how much herb do you

93
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:23,400
require to keep yourself supplied

94
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:24,679
without trying to be stingy without

95
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,400
trying to keep a bunch of to make a

96
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,840
bunch of money how much do you

97
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,080
realistically want to grow and how often

98
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,438
do you need to grow it going to be

99
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,120
something we're going to talk about in a

100
00:03:31,438 --> 00:03:35,680
minute also we will talk about how much

101
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,480
space it's going to take that's what

102
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,680
will really dictate your grow uh a lot

103
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:40,798
of the stuff is covered in previous

104
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,080
episodes you guys but we're going to go

105
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,599
back over a lot of it and we will uh by

106
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:49,000
the end you will have a Perpetual go

107
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:51,679
grow going if you follow this uh I guess

108
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,199
it's a recipe I wrote here

109
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:57,439
anyway holy [ __ ] excuse my throat

110
00:03:54,199 --> 00:04:00,078
clearing there uh this Perpetual lesson

111
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:02,039
is going to be based on a uh on one

112
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:06,000
1,000 watt flowering light this covers

113
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:07,878
about a 4x4 or a 5x5 square foot area so

114
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,438
we're trying to create a Perpetual grow

115
00:04:07,878 --> 00:04:11,639
that suits your needs if you're using

116
00:04:09,438 --> 00:04:14,078
more lights simply multiply this method

117
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:15,759
by however many lights you're using or

118
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:17,120
however you uh seem necessary if you

119
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:19,199
have questions email me grow from

120
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,079
yourart hotmail.com and we'll help

121
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,840
adjust this recipe for your grow room uh

122
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:27,759
I'll tell you about my Perpetual grow I

123
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:30,478
run a four light setup and I fill uh the

124
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:33,360
whole light area with a set of plants

125
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:34,519
and harvest one light every two weeks so

126
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,759
here's where you need to make a decision

127
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:38,680
on your Perpetual setup you need to

128
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:41,840
decide if you want to start a crop under

129
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:43,840
a light and finish the entire crop and

130
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:46,279
then have another uh set of plants ready

131
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:48,159
as soon as that's done for you uh so

132
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:50,159
that as soon as you chop down that room

133
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,680
that light of plants you have plants

134
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,880
that were in veg in another room as soon

135
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,959
as they're done do you want to refill

136
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:57,639
the entire room or do you want to kind

137
00:04:55,959 --> 00:05:00,560
of stagger it a little

138
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:02,240
bit um I think it's a little in my

139
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,680
opinion I like having a Perpetual

140
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,560
instead of having a whole bunch of herb

141
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,840
to harvest all at one time it can re be

142
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:10,478
a really daunting task in my opinion to

143
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:12,239
try to harvest uh four lights worth of

144
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:14,680
cannabis all at

145
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,079
once Gosh guys excuse my throat clearing

146
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:19,120
that'll go away here after a couple of

147
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:20,839
couple of minutes I hope all right so if

148
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,759
you're working with one strain where was

149
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:24,038
I let's see uh yeah you need to decide

150
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:25,639
if you want to start the whole crop and

151
00:05:24,038 --> 00:05:27,360
run the whole thing where was I you want

152
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:29,759
to stagger your crops so you have a

153
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,479
harvest every 30 days or 2 weeks uh if

154
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,919
you're working with one strain uh that's

155
00:05:31,478 --> 00:05:34,439
a lot easier if you've got multiple

156
00:05:32,918 --> 00:05:37,399
strains try to get

157
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:39,439
strains that uh you're going to have to

158
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:41,359
time it so try to get strains that are

159
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:44,600
all about 8 to nine weeks that's your

160
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:48,160
ideal uh your deal ideal setup foret

161
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:49,680
Perpetual cycle under one light so uh

162
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,080
our main goal here is to have the rooms

163
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,680
moving constantly with as little

164
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:55,038
downtime as possible to keep your

165
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:56,800
production at its maximum without any

166
00:05:55,038 --> 00:05:59,120
interruptions uh that way you don't have

167
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,639
any interruptions in your medicine so I

168
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,399
told you guys let's see I talk a little

169
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:06,000
bit about my for light my personal grow

170
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:07,839
uh is a Perpetual setup I harvest one

171
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,519
light every two weeks like I was saying

172
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:11,719
I'd rather trim one light worth of buds

173
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:13,680
which for me is a pound than four lights

174
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,199
which would be four pounds easily

175
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,280
sometimes it's pound and a half

176
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,759
sometimes it's more just depends on what

177
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:20,359
trins I'm running so I'm harvesting

178
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:23,240
every two weeks it means that every two

179
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:25,680
weeks I'm cutting clones I'm doing trans

180
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:27,400
transplants uh I'm putting taking clones

181
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,918
out of the cloner putting them into cups

182
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:32,318
and I'm harvesting every two weeks so uh

183
00:06:30,918 --> 00:06:34,399
I have four flowering lights in my

184
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,360
flowering area I have two lights in my

185
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:39,519
vegging area and I have a separate light

186
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:43,080
for my moms and clones uh I have about

187
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:44,879
every 14 days I cut 12 clones after 14

188
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:47,959
days those clones go into cups and go

189
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:49,680
under a light in my mom and clone area

190
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:51,478
uh this could be like a T5 or a metal

191
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,160
highlight light or even an LED if you're

192
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:55,959
into that uh some uh those plants that I

193
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,520
cut will stay in the cups for about 2

194
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:59,239
weeks before they're transplanted into

195
00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:00,519
seven gallon pots and you guys I'm going

196
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,639
to give you a lot of detail about this I

197
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:02,959
know I'm going kind of fast right now

198
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:04,199
I'm giving you a setup on mine and then

199
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:07,680
I'll get into a lot of detail in a

200
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:09,240
minute so I can fit 12 SG pots under my

201
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,639
two veg lights comfortably that gives

202
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:14,560
them enough space and keep in mind some

203
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:16,400
of these are uh we got [ __ ] all the way

204
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,079
from one week up to eight weeks old so

205
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:19,478
the ones on the far end there they're

206
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:20,800
real little so we can squish those

207
00:07:19,478 --> 00:07:22,279
together and the other ones over there

208
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,520
on that end are a little larger so they

209
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:27,559
need more space I can fit 12 of

210
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:28,639
them uh once the plants are in the seven

211
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:31,079
gallon pots they'll hang out in the

212
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:33,000
bedroom for like 30 to 45 days depending

213
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:34,800
on the strain uh if you're going to set

214
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,319
up this Perpetual it'll probably work

215
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:40,120
out to exactly 8 weeks if you do this

216
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:41,759
right uh I use large pots so I can keep

217
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,800
big plants and keep my plant count down

218
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,199
like I was talking about earlier

219
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,199
Colorado is limited by plant counts so

220
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,598
getting as much from each plant is

221
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:52,120
important as much as you can from each

222
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:55,240
plant is important so I have four sets

223
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:56,959
of seven gallon pots under my veg lights

224
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,680
and I would have plants in veg for 2

225
00:07:56,959 --> 00:08:00,318
four six and eight weeks and the plants

226
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:02,959
that have been in veg for 8 weeks will

227
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,598
go into the flower room on week nine and

228
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:06,359
more plants will be dropped into seven

229
00:08:04,598 --> 00:08:08,759
gallon pots everything will be slid over

230
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:10,919
four spaces and the empty spaces I just

231
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:12,759
made will be replaced and it'll be

232
00:08:10,918 --> 00:08:15,198
Tetris all right over the left so that

233
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:16,598
it's right by the door to the next room

234
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,919
so like I said every two weeks I'm

235
00:08:16,598 --> 00:08:19,759
harvesting a light I'm cutting more

236
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:21,240
clones I'm putting clones into cups

237
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:25,038
putting cups into pots and I'm keeping

238
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:27,038
the cycle moving while maintaining a uh

239
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:28,759
Pest Management regimen uh I'm

240
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:30,959
lollipopping these plants I'm doing

241
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:33,158
pruning uh it's a lot of work to do in

242
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:34,879
there guys you can't just slack off but

243
00:08:33,158 --> 00:08:36,679
it's a lot of work and it pays off every

244
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:38,399
two weeks I've got a pound of herb

245
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:40,598
harvested for myself every two weeks if

246
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,759
I do this properly so that's basically

247
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:45,240
my setup there uh you guys might not

248
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:47,159
have four lights so let's talk about

249
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:49,240
getting your Perpetual plan I got to

250
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:52,439
reach over and plug this phone in all

251
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:54,680
right so uh to have a per Perpetual grow

252
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,480
you'll need a solid mother plant or a

253
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:58,120
source of reliable clones I don't want

254
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,959
to rely on somebody else for clones I

255
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,879
would definitely recommend

256
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:04,078
keeping a mother plant if you have a

257
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:05,360
mother plant maybe if I haven't talked

258
00:09:04,078 --> 00:09:06,319
thoroughly enough about mother plants

259
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,159
I'm going to write a note right now I

260
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,200
need a

261
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:12,199
pen I'll write a note to talk about

262
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,040
mother plants in the future and then we

263
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,399
can kind of talk about keeping a mom

264
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:18,199
that'll be a whole another episode

265
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:20,440
writing it down mother plant episode

266
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:22,040
boom I know it takes me a long time to

267
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,600
write but I rather be able to read it

268
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:25,799
later there we go mother plants I wrote

269
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,920
that so have a good mother

270
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:30,359
plant uh I'll talk about selecting a mom

271
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:33,120
I'll go WI depth on that for you if I

272
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:35,000
haven't so for this mother plant uh for

273
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,720
the mother plant you need a light cycle

274
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,679
that stays on in a vegetative cycle I

275
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,800
recommend of course the 18 on and six

276
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:44,399
off or you can try 195 if that works for

277
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:47,078
you um I do that because I see the

278
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,919
plants growing and it keeps any sativas

279
00:09:47,078 --> 00:09:50,599
from autoflowering I've had some sativas

280
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:53,719
that like to Autoflower if the light

281
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:55,240
cycle changes just a little and that 195

282
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:58,079
that extra hour will keep them from

283
00:09:55,240 --> 00:10:00,919
doing that so you can keep your mother

284
00:09:58,078 --> 00:10:02,439
plants and your clones and these cups on

285
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:04,759
the same cycle if you can if you have

286
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:06,640
one light you can fit if you have one

287
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:09,559
good siiz fluorescent light you can fit

288
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:11,879
your cloner and a bunch of cups with

289
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:13,518
clones in there underneath that T5 and

290
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:15,679
you can probably fit a good siiz mother

291
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:18,799
plant underneath there also if you do it

292
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:23,519
right I know two of those T5 fixtures

293
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:26,479
would definitely do it all right so uh

294
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:28,720
this uh for this example Mike and I were

295
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,959
talking and uh of course I had to ask

296
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,200
Mike for some help because I was getting

297
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:35,199
stuck so shout out to mikee for helping

298
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:37,560
me um he came up with the idea to use a

299
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:40,000
uh two 5x5 grow ttin because that's when

300
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:42,599
he met me I was growing in grow tents he

301
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,480
learned a lot from those grow tents so

302
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,360
we're using two of those 5x5 grow tins

303
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,560
if you don't have grow ttin you can use

304
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:50,278
a bedroom or whatever and you can divide

305
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:53,078
it into two spaces as long as your

306
00:10:50,278 --> 00:10:55,639
flowering space is totally dark during

307
00:10:53,078 --> 00:10:58,000
the night cycle you'll be okay I can't

308
00:10:55,639 --> 00:11:01,000
stress enough how important it is to

309
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,839
have a totally Dark Night cycle in your

310
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,799
flowering room okay so we're going to

311
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:08,519
use two 5x 510 right and you can use a

312
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:11,240
bedroom uh you can divide it out so one

313
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:13,440
is a flowering Hut I said that right

314
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:14,600
one's a veg space one's a flowering Hut

315
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,399
all right so we've got the one flowering

316
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:19,360
space it's a 5 by5 with 1,000 watt light

317
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:22,480
in there our other room is a 5x5 room or

318
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:24,600
tent uh that'll be our veg in mom space

319
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,278
all right so it's actually going to take

320
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,560
a couple of weeks to get your Perpetual

321
00:11:26,278 --> 00:11:30,759
grow flowing and productive but once it

322
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:32,679
starts the flow should run perfectly if

323
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:34,958
you plan ahead and stay on top of your

324
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:37,559
chores don't get lazy don't get

325
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:40,000
complacent you have to stay in there and

326
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:42,239
be on top of things so in my example

327
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,759
we're going to set up a a Perpetual grow

328
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:47,240
to harvest one large Plant every two

329
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:49,399
weeks and your goal is 4 ounces per

330
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:51,919
plant with this method so we're going to

331
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:53,519
put one sgon pot under the light every

332
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:55,000
two weeks we need to start with a mother

333
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,720
plant or some clones so in this case

334
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,519
we'll start with a healthy mom uh you

335
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,200
should have your mom's uh your mom rooms

336
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,799
or Huts built and running before we even

337
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,560
take the first clone for the Perpetual

338
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:06,919
grow so you've got your rooms happy and

339
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:08,838
your mother plant is nice and healthy

340
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:10,360
now we cut clones to start our Cycles I

341
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:12,160
don't know if you're using like rapid

342
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,680
rooters or if you're using rock wool

343
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:16,198
cubes or if you're using an easy cloner

344
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:17,679
but either way two weeks is your your

345
00:12:16,198 --> 00:12:20,719
due date for these clones they've got to

346
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:24,679
be rooted and ready to rock in two weeks

347
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:26,360
if you're not proficient in cloning I

348
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:28,638
would recommend cutting these clones

349
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:30,720
early so take some practice get some

350
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:33,079
practice and get some clones going so

351
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:36,278
we've got the 5x5 Hut that's one 1,000

352
00:12:33,078 --> 00:12:38,198
watt flowering light and 5x5 area so

353
00:12:36,278 --> 00:12:41,078
this is what would happen on week one we

354
00:12:38,198 --> 00:12:42,879
would cut clones and let them root and

355
00:12:41,078 --> 00:12:45,359
if for this one light situation we only

356
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:48,039
need one clone out of this whole setup

357
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,800
so cut some clones and hopefully in 14

358
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:53,559
days one of those clones is

359
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:55,198
rooted so now week two you don't have

360
00:12:53,559 --> 00:12:57,879
much to do except make sure the Clones

361
00:12:55,198 --> 00:12:59,639
are rooted and happy so week three of

362
00:12:57,879 --> 00:13:02,278
the Perpetual cycle

363
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:04,320
uh you're going to take more

364
00:13:02,278 --> 00:13:06,078
clones okay first you have to I guess

365
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,600
take the Clones out of the cloning area

366
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:09,078
put them into cups and then you're also

367
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,959
going to cut more clones for the next

368
00:13:09,078 --> 00:13:13,039
run and you're only going to need one

369
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:14,319
keeper again so those clones that you

370
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:16,759
just put into cups You're going to let

371
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,600
them go for 14 more days and then you'll

372
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:20,198
just pick the best one and the Clones

373
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,519
that you just put in the cloner in 14

374
00:13:20,198 --> 00:13:23,719
days you're going to pick the best one

375
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:25,839
of those all right so we only need one

376
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,720
at a time to survive but cut extras you

377
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,880
guys cuz it's always better to have some

378
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:32,278
to choose from

379
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:34,039
so week four week four is another chill

380
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:35,919
week but make sure the cups and the

381
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:37,879
Clones are happy and as healthy as you

382
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:39,599
can make them and the mother plant you

383
00:13:37,879 --> 00:13:41,039
need so oh I didn't add that in here you

384
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,440
guys we're going to need to make love to

385
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:43,559
the mother plant every once in a while

386
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:46,000
you got to get in there and trim that

387
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:47,159
sexy [ __ ] up so I guess taking clones

388
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,240
every two weeks you'll be able to do

389
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:51,838
that something I should have made a note

390
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:53,720
of all right week five week five is

391
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,759
where we start to get busy you guys we

392
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:57,480
need to put the Clones into cups of dirt

393
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:59,680
we need to cut more

394
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:01,240
clones uh we need to

395
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:02,638
uh we only need one keeper like I said

396
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,159
every two weeks but I would take a few

397
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,839
extras and choose from the best I wrote

398
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:07,439
that down a lot of times uh the plants

399
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,800
that we cut that we put into cups two

400
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,720
weeks ago will now go into seven gallon

401
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:14,359
pots and go under the veg lights if

402
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,399
you're in that 5x5 Hut you should have

403
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:19,199
plenty of room for your mother plant a

404
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:21,600
little bit of clones a couple of Cups

405
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:25,198
and four seven gallon pots it it'll work

406
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:27,399
trust me so in week five uh we're going

407
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:29,198
to put One S gallon pot under the veg

408
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:30,639
lights and that's going to sit there for

409
00:14:29,198 --> 00:14:33,039
eight weeks you guys but now you have

410
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,639
your first veg plant in veg you're

411
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:36,159
showing some progress you got that one

412
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:38,198
little itty bitty plant in a seven

413
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:40,838
gallon pot and it's only taking five

414
00:14:38,198 --> 00:14:42,159
weeks so week six is kind of another

415
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:43,959
chill week but you have to make sure all

416
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:46,439
your plants are looking good cuz now

417
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:48,359
you're really setting the pace for your

418
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:50,440
productivity don't forget to watch for

419
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:52,360
bugs uh start doing any pruning and

420
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:53,839
training that you want to do make sure

421
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:56,199
you're getting good on your cloning game

422
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:58,000
you've had a lot of practice by now so

423
00:14:56,198 --> 00:14:59,479
just start perfecting [ __ ] start really

424
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,600
paying attention to details now you have

425
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:04,000
a rhythm going start paying attention to

426
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,480
things let's move into week seven I'm

427
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,559
doing pretty good I'm at about 16 uh

428
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,920
yeah after a couple of edits here we

429
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:13,479
should be hit about 15 minutes so week

430
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:15,399
seven um for week seven we need to put

431
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:18,039
the Clones out of the cloning area into

432
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:19,919
cups and then we need to cut more clones

433
00:15:18,039 --> 00:15:22,078
remember guys we just need one but cut

434
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:24,879
several uh then we need to put another

435
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:27,120
clone into a 7 gallon pot and then that

436
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:29,600
goes under that veg light and now we

437
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:32,519
have two of our first four plants under

438
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:35,159
the veg light and the first one has

439
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:36,720
seven more weeks or no it's got uh yeah

440
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:39,120
we're going on odd numbers right so it

441
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,040
would have six more weeks to cook before

442
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,318
it's going to go the first one's got a

443
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:44,439
few more weeks to cook before it's going

444
00:15:42,318 --> 00:15:46,078
to go into the bedroom and this one's

445
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,639
now got eight so the other ones got six

446
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:50,239
yeah because we're going to be

447
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:52,278
harvesting every two weeks so week eight

448
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,839
is another week to focus on training and

449
00:15:52,278 --> 00:15:55,720
pruning and plant health and keeping

450
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:57,680
your mother plant happy checking for

451
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:59,079
bugs going in there and cleaning up the

452
00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:01,919
bottoms of all the plants that are in

453
00:15:59,078 --> 00:16:03,679
the uh vegging area there's stuff to do

454
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:06,479
every week even though we're not doing

455
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:08,599
the big cycle on the even numbered weeks

456
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:11,480
so week nine I'm sure you're catching on

457
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:14,079
by now take the Clones out of the cloner

458
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:16,319
put them into cups cut new clones put a

459
00:16:14,078 --> 00:16:17,958
clone from a cup into a seven gallon pot

460
00:16:16,318 --> 00:16:19,639
and into the veg area so now you've got

461
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:21,518
three seven gallon pots under the veg

462
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:23,639
light uh one of them is getting big and

463
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:25,560
bushy by now and it's almost time to

464
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:27,399
flower that [ __ ] uh if you want to do

465
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:29,879
any topping or anything or any pruning

466
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:32,399
to it now is a good time

467
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:34,879
uh week 10 is another off week but it's

468
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,600
a good time to check for bugs uh we've

469
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:38,958
been going at it for 10 weeks now so

470
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:41,680
check all of your equipment out uh clean

471
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:43,198
up all your fans uh make sure the floor

472
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:46,758
is clean just get in there and clean

473
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:48,958
everything up on week 10 week 11 here we

474
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:50,879
go again we're going to put clones into

475
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:52,958
cups we're going to cut more clones

476
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:56,078
we're going to put our favorite clone

477
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:59,119
into a sgon pot and put that into the

478
00:16:56,078 --> 00:17:01,519
veg area so now you have got four s

479
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:04,199
gallon pots in your room is full and we

480
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:05,759
will flower out our first plant in 2

481
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:07,519
weeks and I know that sounds like a long

482
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:09,199
time it's going to take us 13 weeks to

483
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:11,038
flower our first plant before we even

484
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:13,079
start flowering our first plant but

485
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:15,078
trust me once you get this rhythm going

486
00:17:13,078 --> 00:17:16,959
it's totally going to be worth it so

487
00:17:15,078 --> 00:17:18,639
week 12 this is the last week before you

488
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:21,798
start flowering plants make sure your

489
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:24,160
Bloom room is ready have that 5x5

490
00:17:21,798 --> 00:17:25,759
flowering room cleaned up sparkly make

491
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,160
sure the floor is clean make sure the

492
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:29,960
ceiling is

493
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:31,160
clean clean it all clean it again even

494
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:33,079
if you did go in there and clean it

495
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:35,160
again and then after that clean it one

496
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:36,480
more time and then inspect it one more

497
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,960
time and find what you missed because

498
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,360
there's something that you missed do you

499
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:42,759
have a fire extinguisher near your grow

500
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:44,558
do you have a smoke detector near your

501
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:46,319
grow those are probably two things you

502
00:17:44,558 --> 00:17:48,160
forgot about I don't want to see your

503
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:49,678
home I don't even want to say what could

504
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,120
happen you know what what I'm getting at

505
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,960
right so get a smoke detector put it

506
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:54,759
near your grow get a fire extinguisher

507
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,919
and put it outside of the room so that

508
00:17:54,759 --> 00:17:57,400
in the worst case scenario you don't

509
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,720
have to run in there to get the fire

510
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:02,240
extinguisher to put the [ __ ] fire out

511
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:05,519
have it outside of the room yeah just do

512
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:07,120
that for me please so your room is ready

513
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:09,839
you're ready the plants are ready week

514
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:12,158
13 here we go you guys this is when it

515
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:14,079
gets fun this is the first day we start

516
00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:16,320
the flowering cycle today you get to

517
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:19,279
move that largest plant into the

518
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:21,918
flowering room and begin the bloom phase

519
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:25,519
and now in 8 to 9 weeks hopefully 60

520
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:28,240
days we'll have buds to harvest and then

521
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:30,440
every two weeks after that you can

522
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:33,519
Harvest if you keep this rhythm going

523
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:36,159
properly um I'm serious about the

524
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:37,679
scheduling of this if you [ __ ] this up

525
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:39,880
you will be way behind and everything

526
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:41,320
will fall apart because you will miss a

527
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:43,080
beat and you won't know where to jump

528
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:45,720
back on it's like playing a really fast

529
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:47,720
song and once you jumped off that beat

530
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:49,600
it's going to take a minute to recover

531
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:52,440
and your lungs and your smoking habits

532
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:55,000
are definitely going to notice so check

533
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:56,159
it out week 13 move that big plant that

534
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,038
you've been working on that's been in

535
00:18:56,159 --> 00:19:01,480
veg for8 weeks now that plant was in veg

536
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:04,000
for 8 weeks in a cup for two weeks and

537
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:06,279
in a cloner for two other weeks 12 weeks

538
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,279
of life and now you're just now moving

539
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:10,918
that sucker into the flowering room so

540
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:14,240
after you move that into the flowering

541
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:15,799
room feed it its flowering nutrients you

542
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,679
got to feed it flowering nutrients we've

543
00:19:15,798 --> 00:19:20,240
talked about uh what to feeding stuff on

544
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:21,440
week one so feed that plant it's

545
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,759
flowering

546
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:26,798
NES uh then you have to you guessed it

547
00:19:24,759 --> 00:19:29,200
take a clone out of the cloner put it

548
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:31,639
into a cup cut more clones put your

549
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,120
favorite cup into a sgon pot and replace

550
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,840
that seven gallon pot that you just

551
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:37,239
moved into the flowering room with a

552
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:39,959
fresh pot and a little baby plant in it

553
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:42,240
so now you've got one plant in flower

554
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:43,960
and you should have four plants in veg

555
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,679
now our goal is to keep this moving and

556
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:48,200
add a plant into the room every two

557
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:50,480
weeks you'll need to cut clones put

558
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:52,919
clones into cups put a cup into a seven

559
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:55,599
gallon pot drag a fresh plant into the

560
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:58,400
flowering room every 2 weeks and

561
00:19:55,599 --> 00:20:00,759
eventually you will also be harvesting a

562
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:03,640
plant every 2 weeks if you're running a

563
00:20:00,759 --> 00:20:06,960
56 to 60 day

564
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:08,400
strain yes if that went right that means

565
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,519
that every two weeks you'll be pulling

566
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,840
off about a quar pound of herb for

567
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:15,759
yourself if you do this properly it will

568
00:20:12,839 --> 00:20:17,879
become a small parttime job for yourself

569
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:19,919
to maintain this but the more work and

570
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:21,919
love you put into it the better your

571
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:23,720
product will be I promise you some

572
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:25,200
people are like how is your herb so good

573
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:27,079
and I'm like I go in the grow room for

574
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,400
hours every day I touch every single

575
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:30,639
plant with my hands look on the bottoms

576
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,000
of the leaves I walk in there in the

577
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,559
morning and I'm like which plant haven't

578
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,400
I spent enough time with and I pick one

579
00:20:34,558 --> 00:20:37,798
and I turn the leaves upside down and I

580
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,720
look at the bottoms of the leaves and

581
00:20:37,798 --> 00:20:41,279
make sure there are no bugs and I look

582
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:43,440
around the room and I just stare into

583
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:44,839
the room like an old guy staring off the

584
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,240
porch into nothing but I'm looking

585
00:20:44,839 --> 00:20:48,399
around the room to see if there's a

586
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,919
problem that maybe I didn't miss or

587
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,720
maybe if there's something I could tweak

588
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:53,000
to make the air flow a little bit better

589
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,839
to control the temperature and the

590
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,279
humidity just a little bit better when

591
00:20:54,839 --> 00:21:00,279
I'm away I don't know so be in there do

592
00:20:58,279 --> 00:21:01,678
some work keep on top of it I don't even

593
00:21:00,279 --> 00:21:03,918
know what the [ __ ] started that R I'm

594
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:05,120
sorry so after 8 weeks it'll be time to

595
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:07,080
harvest that first plant that you put

596
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:09,519
into your flowering room uh it may need

597
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:11,240
a few extra days for the plant to finish

598
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:13,759
uh just squeeze that plant in there for

599
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:16,319
the last few days or if you have this

600
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:19,480
available put that plant in its own dark

601
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:21,439
room for two days before you harvest it

602
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:22,759
and it will kind of DSE up the buds and

603
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,038
I think it'll kind of make it a little

604
00:21:22,759 --> 00:21:27,480
more resinous I think it does make it

605
00:21:25,038 --> 00:21:29,798
kind of more dense is the word for it it

606
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:31,200
tightens up a little bit that 48 Hours

607
00:21:29,798 --> 00:21:32,720
of dark kind of shocks the plant and

608
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,558
makes it kick out the last bit of resin

609
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,038
that it can put out it's getting freaked

610
00:21:34,558 --> 00:21:38,399
out it knows it's going to

611
00:21:36,038 --> 00:21:40,359
die so now you should have a full

612
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:43,200
Perpetual setup that should yield 3 to 5

613
00:21:40,359 --> 00:21:44,558
ounces of herb every two weeks and if

614
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,278
you do this right you can keep your

615
00:21:44,558 --> 00:21:49,038
plant count down to like 10 or 15 if you

616
00:21:47,278 --> 00:21:50,798
only have one mother plant and you get

617
00:21:49,038 --> 00:21:54,480
good at cloning because you're going to

618
00:21:50,798 --> 00:21:56,240
have uh four in flower and then you're

619
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,640
going to have four in your veg area

620
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,440
that's eight plants then you've got your

621
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:02,080
mother plant and then you've got that

622
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,558
one that's in a cup that's uh 10 plants

623
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:05,678
right there if you take a couple of

624
00:22:03,558 --> 00:22:06,879
extra clones and have a couple of extra

625
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:09,360
mother plants or whatever you know

626
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:11,960
that's going to put you up near 15 or 20

627
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:14,119
but dude you're pulling a quarter pound

628
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:15,919
of herb with 10 plants in your house and

629
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:18,399
you're using two maybe three lights

630
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:20,080
doing this see that's going to work it's

631
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,360
going to work for you guys uh if you

632
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:23,720
have any questions let me know so your

633
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:26,199
other option here would be to veg all

634
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:27,839
four of your plants for 30 to 45 days

635
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:29,919
and throw them all into the flowering

636
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:31,839
room and it's a good idea but like I was

637
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:33,320
saying when it comes to harvesting all

638
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:34,879
that pot you're hopefully going to pull

639
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:36,798
off a pound of weed here you guys maybe

640
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,278
a pound and a quarter oh my God I just

641
00:22:36,798 --> 00:22:41,319
burped that root beer right into the mic

642
00:22:38,278 --> 00:22:42,798
I'm sorry rude rude rude Rockstar uh

643
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:44,759
you're hoping to pull a pound and a quar

644
00:22:42,798 --> 00:22:47,480
pound and a half a herb off that I would

645
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:49,440
rather trim you know 3 to five ounces

646
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:51,400
every two weeks and give my wrist a

647
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:54,120
break than be at it trimming for two

648
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:55,360
weeks straight because it gets crazy you

649
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:57,439
start cutting down plants and they're

650
00:22:55,359 --> 00:22:59,240
all ripe at the same time and so you got

651
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,840
[ __ ] drying all at the same time you go

652
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:03,839
into panic mode you got to trim this

653
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:05,839
whole pound of herb uh I trim usually

654
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:07,720
myself and one maybe two other people at

655
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:09,678
the table cuz it just gets crowded and

656
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:12,120
it gets loud and I'd rather keep it

657
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:14,640
peaceful and have less people here just

658
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:16,119
kind of quiet for my head uh so that's

659
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,278
why I do the Perpetual grow it's a

660
00:23:16,119 --> 00:23:20,000
little bit better and then it also makes

661
00:23:18,278 --> 00:23:22,319
you feel like something's happening

662
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,119
instead of waiting 60 days for that damn

663
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:26,879
crop to finish you can oh it's cool I've

664
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:28,519
got one in two weeks so it doesn't feel

665
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,720
like it's so long of course the next

666
00:23:28,519 --> 00:23:34,000
crop is 60 days but since I started one

667
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:35,400
40 days ago and then uh what's 40 - 14 I

668
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,558
[ __ ] myself picking a weird number

669
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:40,200
like that but since I picked one seven

670
00:23:37,558 --> 00:23:41,678
weeks ago uh and started it then I'm

671
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,919
going to have one in two weeks and then

672
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:45,278
I'm going to have one in two weeks after

673
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,720
that you know I thought I had I'm

674
00:23:45,278 --> 00:23:50,400
rambling because I took a lot of fat

675
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:52,600
dabs and this yeah anyway uh so if you

676
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:55,000
choose to run them all at one time you

677
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:57,519
should have plants in that vedro ready

678
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,440
to flower as soon as that room is empty

679
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:03,440
so you're going to have to to keep a

680
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:05,720
mother plant and then four pots uh four

681
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:08,159
seven gallon pots for about 8 weeks so

682
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:09,519
you'll need clones for two weeks cups

683
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:13,440
for two weeks you'll need four of them

684
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:14,798
four clones four cups uh two weeks each

685
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,480
and then you throw those into the seven

686
00:24:14,798 --> 00:24:20,839
gallon pots and let those go for eight

687
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:23,400
weeks and then when you chop that other

688
00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:24,720
room you throw those plants in there

689
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,798
that same

690
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,038
day that's the only way to keep it going

691
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:31,000
if you want to do it all at once or you

692
00:24:28,038 --> 00:24:32,278
can do two plants every uh 30 days if

693
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,839
that's easier for you if you'd rather

694
00:24:32,278 --> 00:24:35,359
have a half a pound of herb every 30

695
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:36,959
days you could do that as this is

696
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:38,558
completely adjustable this was just the

697
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,679
best I could come up with since I don't

698
00:24:38,558 --> 00:24:42,960
know your garden I hope you find it

699
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:45,798
useful I hope you put it to use I hope

700
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:48,120
you start pulling off somewhere between

701
00:24:45,798 --> 00:24:51,000
3 and 5 ounces for yourself or your

702
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:52,479
patients every two weeks that's a good

703
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,880
supply of medicine for you if you're

704
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:57,679
smoking more than that uh well I can't

705
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,960
judge smoke more than that [ __ ] it I'm

706
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:01,000
not even going to try to try to judge

707
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,798
you for it you might have some reason

708
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,960

Brain if you need um a boost in your

brain and uh you don't want to do like

827
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:05,240
caffeine or yerba mate because it makes

828
00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:08,000
you too uh jittery or something I

head injury it made the clouds go away
