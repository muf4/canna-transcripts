concentrate it's got a nice stony effect

16
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:48,480
to it it's more stony than high seems to

put me in a nice little bubble puts me

18
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:52,078
in my own little space in my head here

19
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:54,148
and I really enjoy that so today we're

20
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:57,448
taking dabs of the banana wafer cush

21
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:59,609
from our friends at apothecary farms all

22
00:00:57,448 --> 00:01:01,439
right podcast world in this episode I'm

23
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:03,660
going to read a few listen or emails and

24
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:05,489
answer a few questions but before I get

25
00:01:03,659 --> 00:01:08,219
there I want to read a comment that came

26
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:10,079
in on the YouTube channel on the last

27
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:12,090
episode I talked about the Colorado

28
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:13,829
crunch now what's the Colorado crunch

29
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:16,109
that is when the herb gets super dry

30
00:01:13,829 --> 00:01:18,390
from being left in the jars all day in

31
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:20,250
the dispensary in Colorado we had a

32
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:23,280
comic they came from a listener named ER

33
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:26,069
on YouTube and Dr says I just want to

34
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,629
add that Bovina packs save my ass I wish

35
00:01:26,069 --> 00:01:29,879
I would see more dispensaries out there

36
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:32,399
using them that don't prepackaged their

37
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:35,789
product now I do appreciate the input

38
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,680
but I do also despise the Veda packs or

39
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:40,049
Boveda packs however you say it I do not

40
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,360
like them in the jars with the product

41
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:45,329
at the dispensary on the shelf in my

42
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:47,938
opinion those packs leave a funky aroma

43
00:01:45,328 --> 00:01:49,798
and flavor on the buds now with that

44
00:01:47,938 --> 00:01:51,688
being said if you like the packs and you

45
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:53,368
like the results that you or your local

46
00:01:51,688 --> 00:01:55,258
dispensary are getting by using those

47
00:01:53,368 --> 00:01:57,450
packs don't change anything because of

48
00:01:55,259 --> 00:02:00,420
what I say do your thing let it work for

49
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:03,030
you but let me make a suggestion for

50
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:05,460
your personal grow this method wouldn't

51
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:07,200
be practical in a dispensary environment

52
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:09,419
but it does work in a commercial grow

53
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,420
and it would work in your personal grow

54
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:13,979
environment if your buds get too crunchy

55
00:02:12,419 --> 00:02:16,169
something I suggest is

56
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:18,419
grabbing a leaf from a fresh plant if

57
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:21,449
you've got a mason jar one leaf will be

58
00:02:18,419 --> 00:02:23,548
enough stick one fresh leaf inside your

59
00:02:21,449 --> 00:02:25,949
mason jar just set it in there seal the

60
00:02:23,549 --> 00:02:26,489
lid leave it in there for like 3045

61
00:02:25,949 --> 00:02:28,408
minutes

62
00:02:26,489 --> 00:02:30,450
crack it open and see how much it has

63
00:02:28,408 --> 00:02:32,519
moistened up the rest of those buds that

64
00:02:30,449 --> 00:02:35,068
moisture from that one leaf will move

65
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:37,349
around in those buds very quickly and

66
00:02:35,068 --> 00:02:39,598
you're using the same plant with the

67
00:02:37,348 --> 00:02:41,310
same breaks level the same aroma the

68
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:44,098
same flavor you're not adding anything

69
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:46,348
different into that jar to make a funky

70
00:02:44,098 --> 00:02:48,659
flavor you are putting the exact same

71
00:02:46,348 --> 00:02:50,578
plant in there with the same aroma the

72
00:02:48,659 --> 00:02:53,159
same flavor you're not gonna mess things

73
00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:55,019
up so if you'd like to get away from the

74
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:57,000
Boveda packs also save yourself a few

75
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:58,859
bucks that is another option for you

76
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,239
maybe experiment if you're interested

77
00:02:58,859 --> 00:03:02,670
again if you're happy with what you've

78
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,799
got going on don't change anything on my

79
00:03:02,669 --> 00:03:06,268
account keep doing what you're doing the

80
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:08,430
only way you're doing it wrong is if you

81
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:10,709
kill the plants or if you're not happy

82
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:11,879
with the final outcome if you're happy

83
00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:13,950
with your final outcome and you're

84
00:03:11,878 --> 00:03:16,018
satisfied with your product keep doing

85
00:03:13,949 --> 00:03:18,418
exactly what you're doing but also keep

86
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:20,519
looking for ways to improve all right

87
00:03:18,419 --> 00:03:22,200

future episode alright now it is time to

99
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:45,180
start working through the mountain of

100
00:03:43,409 --> 00:03:45,689
emails that I've been saving up for the

101
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:48,299
show

102
00:03:45,689 --> 00:03:49,859
I love and appreciate all of the emails

103
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:51,780
and questions that you guys have sent me

104
00:03:49,859 --> 00:03:53,579
but I was tied up in that long series of

105
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:55,620
grow lessons so I wasn't really paying

106
00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:57,719
much attention to the emails now that

107
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:59,639
that series is done it is time to start

108
00:03:57,719 --> 00:04:01,378
working through these emails so let's

109
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:04,609
get right to it on the top of the stack

110
00:04:01,378 --> 00:04:06,959
here this one goes just like this

111
00:04:04,609 --> 00:04:08,669
what's up Rasta Jeff I've been looking

112
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,620
forward to growing for a long time now

113
00:04:08,669 --> 00:04:13,019
over the past year I've loved listening

114
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:14,730
through your podcasts I'm finally ready

115
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:17,459
to get started as all of my equipment

116
00:04:14,729 --> 00:04:18,689
was just delivered this week dude first

117
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:21,209
of all thanks for listening to the show

118
00:04:18,689 --> 00:04:23,189
and second congratulations on all of the

119
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:26,310
new equipment I bet that is super

120
00:04:23,189 --> 00:04:27,579
exciting the message goes on to say I'm

121
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:29,649
going to be working in door

122
00:04:27,579 --> 00:04:32,050
and a four-by-four vibe Oh Sun tint I'm

123
00:04:29,649 --> 00:04:34,568
hoping to put four plants in five gallon

124
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:36,819
buckets under a 1200 watt LED grow light

125
00:04:34,569 --> 00:04:39,699
I'd like to order seeds from your online

126
00:04:36,819 --> 00:04:42,009
store but the selection is so vast that

127
00:04:39,699 --> 00:04:43,629
it's a little intimidating now let me

128
00:04:42,009 --> 00:04:45,939
jump in and say that I don't have a

129
00:04:43,629 --> 00:04:48,158
website that sells seeds I am a breeder

130
00:04:45,939 --> 00:04:50,019
but my seeds are available on other

131
00:04:48,158 --> 00:04:52,750
vendor websites you are probably

132
00:04:50,019 --> 00:04:55,269
referring to the Halliday seed company

133
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:57,668
at dang seed store or possibly your

134
00:04:55,269 --> 00:04:59,769
shopping on Oregon Elite seeds at Oregon

135
00:04:57,668 --> 00:05:01,299
elite seeds dot-com there are a couple

136
00:04:59,769 --> 00:05:02,948
of other great vendors they carry my

137
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,870
products but those are the two who I

138
00:05:02,949 --> 00:05:06,579
have talked about most on here so that

139
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:09,610
is probably where you were shopping and

140
00:05:06,579 --> 00:05:10,508
yes I do agree that it can be quite

141
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:13,689
intimidating

142
00:05:10,509 --> 00:05:15,129
I myself offer over 20 different seed

143
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:17,680
lines so there are 20 lines available

144
00:05:15,129 --> 00:05:20,319
from just myself there are probably 20

145
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,598
or 30 different vendors available on the

146
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:24,340
hella dank seed company organ Elite

147
00:05:22,598 --> 00:05:26,709
seeds has got at least a hundred

148
00:05:24,339 --> 00:05:29,019
breeders available on their website so

149
00:05:26,709 --> 00:05:30,878
it does get very confusing it can get

150
00:05:29,019 --> 00:05:33,068
very intimidating it can be overwhelming

151
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:34,810
very quickly sometimes when I go to a

152
00:05:33,069 --> 00:05:36,278
restaurant or even a dispensary I

153
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:38,228
complain that there are too many options

154
00:05:36,278 --> 00:05:39,459
I say you should just give me one or two

155
00:05:38,228 --> 00:05:40,718
options and say that's what you're

156
00:05:39,459 --> 00:05:42,250
eating and take it and shut up and be

157
00:05:40,718 --> 00:05:44,228
happy because right now it's gonna take

158
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:45,908
me 30 minutes to sift through all these

159
00:05:44,228 --> 00:05:48,189
options just to figure out what I want

160
00:05:45,908 --> 00:05:49,629
so I get it it can be overwhelming it

161
00:05:48,189 --> 00:05:52,750
can be a lot to think about it can be a

162
00:05:49,629 --> 00:05:54,968
lot to look at also some seed strain

163
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:57,339
descriptions can be very deceptive and

164
00:05:54,968 --> 00:05:59,408
very misleading also it can be very

165
00:05:57,339 --> 00:06:01,478
confusing to a new grower what all the

166
00:05:59,408 --> 00:06:03,519
X's and parentheses mean when the

167
00:06:01,478 --> 00:06:05,589
genetics are listed so I totally agree

168
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:07,628
that it can be overwhelming so let's get

169
00:06:05,589 --> 00:06:10,989
ourselves back on track here the message

170
00:06:07,629 --> 00:06:12,729
continues it goes like this I was hoping

171
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:14,379
you could provide some suggestions and

172
00:06:12,728 --> 00:06:16,778
maybe even some pro tips on growing

173
00:06:14,379 --> 00:06:18,340
whichever strain I decide on please let

174
00:06:16,778 --> 00:06:20,500
me know if I can provide any more

175
00:06:18,339 --> 00:06:23,168
information about my situation and help

176
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:25,060
narrow down what would work best it's

177
00:06:23,168 --> 00:06:27,639
going to be my first growth so I'm not

178
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:30,189
expecting perfect results but I figure

179
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:32,199
some expert advice could go a long way

180
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:33,339
looking forward to hearing from you and

181
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:35,199
then they signed it with their name

182
00:06:33,339 --> 00:06:36,668
which I do not have permission to say on

183
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,528
the show so I'm gonna hold that back but

184
00:06:36,668 --> 00:06:40,269
hey do do you know who you are thank you

185
00:06:38,528 --> 00:06:41,379
for the great email let's start

186
00:06:40,269 --> 00:06:44,079
answering a couple of your

187
00:06:41,379 --> 00:06:46,750
questions I really think you've got the

188
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:48,129
right idea with four five gallon pots in

189
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:49,029
this environment that should be just

190
00:06:48,129 --> 00:06:51,159
enough space

191
00:06:49,029 --> 00:06:52,599
don't let the plants get too tall I

192
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,490
don't know how much ceiling height

193
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:56,050
you've got in your tent but make sure

194
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:57,610
you flower soon enough to where those

195
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:59,860
plants don't reach up into your light

196
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:01,990
also make sure that you've got plenty of

197
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:04,629
airflow in that tent you need some way

198
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:06,939
to pull that moist hot stale air out of

199
00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:08,500
the top of that tent and let fresh new

200
00:07:06,939 --> 00:07:09,969
cool air come in into the bottom of the

201
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,889
tent so that you can keep those plants

202
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:13,930
in a healthy environment many new

203
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:15,759
growers overlook the importance of

204
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:18,550
airflow when they are building a grow in

205
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:20,620
a tent so please make sure to have some

206
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:22,810
way to remove that humidity out of the

207
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:24,970
tent it won't go out by itself you need

208
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:26,889
an extraction fan coming out of the tent

209
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:28,570
to suck that humidity out of there and

210
00:07:26,889 --> 00:07:30,639
honestly I don't know much about that

211
00:07:28,569 --> 00:07:32,649
brand of tent and I don't know much

212
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,599
about LEDs but it sounds like you're off

213
00:07:32,649 --> 00:07:36,909
to a good start with your grow so let's

214
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:39,280
focus more on the seed aspect of your

215
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:42,000
question selecting new seeds for your

216
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:45,189
very first grow can be a lot of fun I

217
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,439
would recommend finding a strain that

218
00:07:45,189 --> 00:07:49,600
does not take a really long time to

219
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:52,149
finish something around eight weeks

220
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:54,970
would be ideal for a new grower that is

221
00:07:52,149 --> 00:07:57,039
less time to screw up the product for a

222
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:58,900
new grower that extra week or two is a

223
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:00,939
lot more opportunity for things to go

224
00:07:58,899 --> 00:08:02,529
wrong so try to find something that

225
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:04,660
finishes around eight or nine weeks

226
00:08:02,529 --> 00:08:05,679
would be my first suggestion so as

227
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:07,660
you're scrolling through and you're

228
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,610
looking at flower times if you see that

229
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:11,530
it says it's going to take nine to ten

230
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:13,210
or ten to eleven weeks I've kind of

231
00:08:11,529 --> 00:08:15,000
steer away from that and find something

232
00:08:13,209 --> 00:08:17,289
a little quicker in the flower area

233
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,079
something else to think about do you

234
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:22,540
want to grow regular or feminized seeds

235
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:24,219
you've only got room for four those are

236
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:26,080
the folks that I recommend feminized

237
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:28,240
seeds to folks with very limited space

238
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:29,889
and not a lot of experience those

239
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,049
feminized seeds will help you out in

240
00:08:29,889 --> 00:08:34,269
several different ways first you don't

241
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:36,370
have to look for the male's second you

242
00:08:34,269 --> 00:08:38,259
don't plant a plant and then grow it and

243
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:40,330
then flour it and realize you've got to

244
00:08:38,259 --> 00:08:42,099
throw it away if you were Fino hunting

245
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:44,080
if you were that type of a grower that's

246
00:08:42,099 --> 00:08:45,930
when I suggest you get regular seeds but

247
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:49,120
someone in your situation I may suggest

248
00:08:45,929 --> 00:08:50,649
feminized seeds now I know you said you

249
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,810
were looking for IRA genetics seeds

250
00:08:50,649 --> 00:08:55,439
let's talk about some iris genetics

251
00:08:52,809 --> 00:08:56,969
suggestions they may work well in that

252
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,760
Roah something that I would recommend

253
00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:03,509
that is not feminized would be prana

254
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:05,189
prana is flow cross to arise that flow

255
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:06,509
keeps it kind of short and stocky it

256
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:08,250
smells really nice

257
00:09:06,509 --> 00:09:10,080
it grows nice and bushy it would work

258
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:12,149
well in your environment my next

259
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,590
recommendation would be sun kiss Sun

260
00:09:12,149 --> 00:09:15,929
kiss is not feminized

261
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:18,149
it is a regular seed but it stays nice

262
00:09:15,929 --> 00:09:19,799
and short and squat and it grows real

263
00:09:18,149 --> 00:09:22,110
wide and branchy and I think it would

264
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:24,599
work great in your environment now for

265
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:26,490
feminized options I would recommend the

266
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,560
Michelangelo again we have got the

267
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:30,750
Platinum tangi in there that is cross to

268
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:32,549
my blueberry cookies that one won't get

269
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:34,590
super tall on you it's really easy to

270
00:09:32,549 --> 00:09:36,629
grow it produces well it makes a lot of

271
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:39,180
resin and it smells and tastes like

272
00:09:36,629 --> 00:09:41,189
oranges and funky candies and it is

273
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:44,429
delicious another one I would recommend

274
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:46,590
is the Raphael Raphael does take a

275
00:09:44,429 --> 00:09:48,839
little bit longer to finish but it is

276
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:50,490
very quality product and it is very

277
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:52,830
simple to grow she won't give you any

278
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:54,810
problems except she'll get very large

279
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:56,820
buds which for a new grower will feel

280
00:09:54,809 --> 00:09:58,259
very rewarding you'll have to learn how

281
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,610
to keep those buds from toppling over

282
00:09:58,259 --> 00:10:01,259
you'll have to learn how to use steaks

283
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:02,700
or tomato cages or a trellis or

284
00:10:01,259 --> 00:10:05,220
something but it will be a very

285
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:07,890
rewarding experience and of course the

286
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:10,110
Raphael is available only in feminized

287
00:10:07,889 --> 00:10:12,840
seeds another one I would suggest is

288
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:15,060
Bebop bebop is easy to grow it makes a

289
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:16,560
lot of trichomes and giant buds again

290
00:10:15,059 --> 00:10:17,429
you're going to have to give it some

291
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:19,679
sort of support

292
00:10:17,429 --> 00:10:21,329
bebop will make huge buds early and

293
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:22,979
flower so it needs sticks or tomato

294
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:25,710
cages or something to keep those big

295
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:28,019
buds from flopping over again bebop is

296
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:30,300
only available in feminized seeds my

297
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:32,329
next and final suggestion my

298
00:10:30,299 --> 00:10:34,799
strain-specific recommendation will be

299
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:37,710
Rocksteady Rocksteady is another one of

300
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:40,379
my crosses it is feminized and it does

301
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:43,500
produce giant buds that are covered in

302
00:10:40,379 --> 00:10:45,659
resin and they smell amazing so there

303
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:48,120
are six great options I can recommend

304
00:10:45,659 --> 00:10:49,799
just from my own seed line that I feel

305
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:52,320
would work perfectly in your environment

306
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:54,000
now it does not hurt my feelings at all

307
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,830
if you choose to work with another

308
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,419
breeder there are so many breeders out

309
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:59,550
there because we all offer something

310
00:10:57,419 --> 00:11:01,559
different my friend mr. soll said it's

311
00:10:59,549 --> 00:11:03,329
kind of like bands and music listeners

312
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:04,709
one guy's out there playing one kind of

313
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,970
music one guy's out there playing

314
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:08,250
another kind of music people are

315
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:09,160
naturally going to walk to the kind of

316
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,870
music that draw

317
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:12,519
them I don't take it personally if you

318
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:14,049
prefer another seed company over me

319
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:15,850
they're doing something different I'm

320
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:17,979
doing something different that's how the

321
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:19,480
world is supposed to work but if you're

322
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:22,000
going to buy seeds from another breeder

323
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:23,800
I highly suggest you get something from

324
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,299
a reputable breeder somebody that you

325
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:27,219
have heard of somebody who has been

326
00:11:25,299 --> 00:11:29,859
around for a little while somebody who

327
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:31,689
has a positive online presence maybe you

328
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:33,009
go check out their online their social

329
00:11:31,688 --> 00:11:35,349

360
00:12:41,259 --> 00:12:46,180
that I can confidently recommend to my

361
00:12:43,328 --> 00:12:48,370
listeners so now I have made a few

362
00:12:46,179 --> 00:12:50,169
suggestions on seeds from my lines that

363
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:51,909
would work perfectly for you I have

364
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:53,620
recommended that you buy from a

365
00:12:51,909 --> 00:12:55,058
reputable breeder and I've also

366
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:57,459
suggested that you buy from a reputable

367
00:12:55,058 --> 00:13:00,039
vendor but let's talk about the most

368
00:12:57,458 --> 00:13:02,289
important part the most important part

369
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:04,688
is the consumer and what that consumer

370
00:13:02,289 --> 00:13:06,188
enjoys I'm going to assume that you are

371
00:13:04,688 --> 00:13:09,099
the person that is going to be smoking

372
00:13:06,188 --> 00:13:11,409
most of this finished product so what do

373
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:13,058
you like to smoke what are you into do

374
00:13:11,409 --> 00:13:15,250
you like gassy smells

375
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:17,350
do you like fruity smells do you like

376
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:20,289
oranges do you like strawberries

377
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:22,329
do you like just weird funkiness think

378
00:13:20,289 --> 00:13:23,019
about what type of aromas and flavors

379
00:13:22,328 --> 00:13:25,000
you enjoy

380
00:13:23,019 --> 00:13:26,649
when you smoke cannabis maybe you smoke

381
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,539
something in the past that really stood

382
00:13:26,649 --> 00:13:29,259
out to you what type of flavours did

383
00:13:28,539 --> 00:13:30,789
that have

384
00:13:29,259 --> 00:13:33,189
do you remember what strain that was

385
00:13:30,789 --> 00:13:34,539
maybe you can find that strain maybe you

386
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:36,279
can find a phenotype that really

387
00:13:34,539 --> 00:13:38,139
represents what you had in the past and

388
00:13:36,278 --> 00:13:40,360
then you can have that around for your

389
00:13:38,139 --> 00:13:42,789
own personal grow it's really all about

390
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:45,430
what you enjoy and at this point in the

391
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:47,259
cannabis evolution or revolution you can

392
00:13:45,429 --> 00:13:49,870
probably find something to fit your

393
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:51,490
palate exactly if you were into garlic

394
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:53,470
mashed potatoes and onions there is a

395
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:56,560
strain that smells like that if you were

396
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:58,420
into oranges covered in sugar with a

397
00:13:56,559 --> 00:14:00,939
little bit of cherry juice dusted on it

398
00:13:58,419 --> 00:14:02,979
there is a strain that smells and tastes

399
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:04,810
like that you've just got to check the

400
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:07,149
menu you've got to kind of find what

401
00:14:04,809 --> 00:14:09,129
works for you now the next thing I would

402
00:14:07,149 --> 00:14:11,589
think about what type of effect are you

403
00:14:09,129 --> 00:14:14,169
looking for do you want that Racing head

404
00:14:11,589 --> 00:14:16,180
buzz do you need a big sativa high or do

405
00:14:14,169 --> 00:14:18,189
you need that chilled out indica put you

406
00:14:16,179 --> 00:14:20,379
in the couch watch some cartoons sort of

407
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:22,810
a thing what do you desire are you

408
00:14:20,379 --> 00:14:24,730
consuming for a medicinal effect are you

409
00:14:22,809 --> 00:14:26,949
consuming just because you're a pothead

410
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:28,269
and I'm not judging you either way that

411
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:30,129
just makes a difference in your

412
00:14:28,269 --> 00:14:32,289
selection and what you're going to grow

413
00:14:30,129 --> 00:14:34,000
also what are you going to do with the

414
00:14:32,289 --> 00:14:36,309
final product are you going to smoke it

415
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,230
in flower form are you going to press it

416
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:39,909
into rosin are you going to make bubble

417
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:42,789
hash are you going to make some type of

418
00:14:39,909 --> 00:14:44,740
BHO or hydrocarbon extraction that is

419
00:14:42,789 --> 00:14:47,559
another thing to keep in mind when you

420
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:49,360
are planning your seed selection so

421
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:51,578

435
00:15:15,669 --> 00:15:19,028
information about my situation man it

436
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:21,040
sounds like you did a pretty good job

437
00:15:19,028 --> 00:15:22,149
explaining what you've got going on you

438
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:24,039
made it clear the size of your

439
00:15:22,149 --> 00:15:25,208
environment and the amount and size of

440
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:26,559
pots you're gonna put in there and the

441
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:28,179
amount of light as long as you've got

442
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:30,099
some airflow in there I think you'll be

443
00:15:28,179 --> 00:15:31,958
doing just fine I would also recommend

444
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:33,310
some carbon filtration but other than

445
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:35,500
that it sounds like you were off to a

446
00:15:33,309 --> 00:15:36,939
good start the last line of your message

447
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:39,039
says that it's going to be your first

448
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:40,540
Rosi are not expecting perfect results

449
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:41,949
but you know that some expert advice

450
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:44,349

451
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:47,259
hey expect perfect results man strive

452
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:49,090
for perfection in your first grow now I

453
00:15:47,259 --> 00:15:51,250
do have some expert advice for you that

454
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:54,070
will help your first grow be perfect if

455
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:56,799
you do pay close attention to details my

456
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:59,740
first piece of advice is to buy a grow

457
00:15:56,799 --> 00:16:02,409
book from a reputable grow author a

458
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:05,320
cannabis expert somebody who has done

459
00:16:02,409 --> 00:16:07,779
this repeatedly for years and has the

460
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:11,740
knowledge to put it into a book buy one

461
00:16:07,779 --> 00:16:13,209
or two books then read those books the

462
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:14,710
books are no good if you buy them and

463
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:16,000
send them by the toilet and it looks

464
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:17,740
like you're cool because you have those

465
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,419
books you look cool cuz you have them

466
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:20,889
but they don't do [ __ ] for you you don't

467
00:16:19,419 --> 00:16:22,209
have the knowledge that is in that book

468
00:16:20,889 --> 00:16:23,620
it looks like you've got the knowledge

469
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:25,210
that's in that book but if I ask you a

470
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:26,769
question and you haven't read the book

471
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:27,550
you don't get the knowledge just by

472
00:16:26,769 --> 00:16:29,740
sitting it there

473
00:16:27,549 --> 00:16:31,899
I do hope that in the future we can by

474
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:34,029
USB thumb drives and you can just pop

475
00:16:31,899 --> 00:16:35,620
them into little USB port right behind

476
00:16:34,029 --> 00:16:37,329
your ear in your neck and then you can

477
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:39,129
upload all of the information from that

478
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:40,720
book into your brain but we are not

479
00:16:39,129 --> 00:16:42,789
there yet so you do have to buy the book

480
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:46,000
you have to open it and you have to read

481
00:16:42,789 --> 00:16:48,849
it so read a couple of reputable grow

482
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:52,240
books my next piece of expert advice

483
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:54,430
would be to go back to episode 351 and

484
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,980
start listening to the grow series from

485
00:16:54,429 --> 00:16:58,870
episode 351 and catch all of the grow

486
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:00,519
lessons that take you from the very

487
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:02,259
beginning of the grow all the way

488
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:04,059
through harvest all the way through

489
00:17:02,259 --> 00:17:06,640
cleaning up all the way through smoking

490
00:17:04,059 --> 00:17:08,708
your finished product so go back and

491
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,449
listen to all of the grow lessons and I

492
00:17:08,709 --> 00:17:13,180
feel like you will have a good head

493
00:17:10,449 --> 00:17:14,860
start on your first grow and if you're

494
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:16,990
not the type of person that will go back

495
00:17:14,859 --> 00:17:19,088
and pick out the grow lesson episodes

496
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:21,039
that's okay because I plan to do

497
00:17:19,088 --> 00:17:23,649
compilations of all of the lessons

498
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:25,209
uninterrupted consecutively so what I

499
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:26,350
mean by that is I'm going to find the

500
00:17:25,209 --> 00:17:28,480
first grow lesson

501
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:30,730
the second grow lesson the third grow

502
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:33,430
lesson and I will put just the lessons

503
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:35,769
in order in a long episode in about

504
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:37,750
three hours so however many episodes

505
00:17:35,769 --> 00:17:40,930
will fit in a three-hour chunk that's

506
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:43,210
how many will go in episode 401 and then

507
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:45,100
the next group of lessons will go in 402

508
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:47,259
and I'm going to do that until we get

509
00:17:45,099 --> 00:17:48,639
through that entire grow series that way

510
00:17:47,259 --> 00:17:50,339
all the lessons are out there

511
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,620
uninterrupted without those

512
00:17:50,339 --> 00:17:54,089
random episodes me and Mike talking and

513
00:17:52,619 --> 00:17:56,038
me talking about random [ __ ] in the

514
00:17:54,089 --> 00:17:58,168
middle of the gross series so I plan to

515
00:17:56,038 --> 00:18:00,538
put it all out in a consecutive chunk

516
00:17:58,169 --> 00:18:02,850
without interruptions in the very near

517
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:04,408
future alright I want to thank you once

518
00:18:02,849 --> 00:18:06,000
again for that email and I do look

519
00:18:04,409 --> 00:18:09,090
forward to hearing from you when you

520
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,339
make your IRA genetics selection and you

521
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:13,230
get that garden started all right I'm

522
00:18:11,339 --> 00:18:15,058
gonna jump right into the next email and

523
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:17,339
it goes like this

524
00:18:15,058 --> 00:18:18,928
Rasta Jeff I've been growing at home for

525
00:18:17,339 --> 00:18:21,869
a little over two years and have grown

526
00:18:18,929 --> 00:18:24,240
approximately 15 plants with the results

527
00:18:21,869 --> 00:18:27,028
varying from average to probably below

528
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,919
average results hey Pema first of all

529
00:18:27,028 --> 00:18:31,048
proud of you for being able to admit

530
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:33,630
that you had below average or average

531
00:18:31,048 --> 00:18:35,609
results most growers think that their

532
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:36,720
first product is the most amazing [ __ ]

533
00:18:35,609 --> 00:18:38,788
that they have ever grown and they've

534
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:41,548
got an ego problem so you were already

535
00:18:38,788 --> 00:18:43,259
doing better than a lot of growers the

536
00:18:41,548 --> 00:18:44,730
email goes on to say all of my plants

537
00:18:43,259 --> 00:18:47,398
have been healthy-looking and grow well

538
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:49,470
in the vegetative stage I have used a

539
00:18:47,398 --> 00:18:51,418
variety of nutrients with none of them

540
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:53,548
appearing to be some kind of magic

541
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:56,399
bullet yes that is absolutely accurate

542
00:18:53,548 --> 00:18:58,679
that is correct there is no magic bullet

543
00:18:56,398 --> 00:19:00,359
when it comes to plant nutrients there

544
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:02,850
are a lot of things that go into keeping

545
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:06,028
a plant happy nutrients are a very small

546
00:19:02,849 --> 00:19:08,369
part of that pie and no nutrient bottle

547
00:19:06,028 --> 00:19:11,220
or nutrient company is a magic solution

548
00:19:08,369 --> 00:19:12,538
or a magic bullet like you've said the

549
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:15,990
email goes on to say I am currently

550
00:19:12,538 --> 00:19:17,879
experimenting with the cns 17 line from

551
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:20,460
botanic hair in deep water culture and

552
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:22,260
of course that CNS stands for a

553
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:23,579
commercial nutrient system that should

554
00:19:22,259 --> 00:19:25,980
work great in the deep water culture

555
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:28,769
there he also says I use recharge

556
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:31,079
cal-mag and a bloom booster in flower I

557
00:19:28,769 --> 00:19:34,408
feel like I can read plants relatively

558
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:36,928
well but I find myself unsure as to the

559
00:19:34,409 --> 00:19:40,830
quantity of nutrients to provide through

560
00:19:36,929 --> 00:19:43,200
plants different stages typically I find

561
00:19:40,829 --> 00:19:45,960
myself doing a sort of ramp up at a rate

562
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:49,830
of about 200 PPM's per week from week

563
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:52,440
one after seed sprout until I hit 1200

564
00:19:49,829 --> 00:19:55,139
ish PPM's and that is typically where I

565
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:57,899
usually plateau I am a little nervous to

566
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:59,549
go too high too fast can you give me any

567
00:19:57,898 --> 00:20:02,250
tips on how to do a better job of

568
00:19:59,548 --> 00:20:03,970
pushing my plants or how you go about

569
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:06,190
determining how much is

570
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:08,980
strike any advice would be greatly

571
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:11,769
appreciated on another note you have

572
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:13,089
hands down the best podcast for cannabis

573
00:20:11,769 --> 00:20:15,369
information out there

574
00:20:13,089 --> 00:20:18,189
the sound quality information and care

575
00:20:15,369 --> 00:20:19,869
you take is definitely noticed also not

576
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:22,420
a man-crush thing but you have a great

577
00:20:19,869 --> 00:20:23,049
radio voice I could fall asleep to that

578
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:25,060
[ __ ]

579
00:20:23,049 --> 00:20:28,089
can't wait to run a batch of a rise when

580
00:20:25,059 --> 00:20:30,099
helideck has them backed in so on the

581
00:20:28,089 --> 00:20:31,869
other note about the best podcast dude I

582
00:20:30,099 --> 00:20:33,219
appreciate that there is no competition

583
00:20:31,869 --> 00:20:35,259
but when you were told you're the best

584
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:37,690
honestly it will always put a smile on

585
00:20:35,259 --> 00:20:40,180
your face so thank you I appreciate that

586
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:42,190
the sound quality is truly important to

587
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:43,750
me I am a sound nerd I've got a lot of

588
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:45,910
great sound equipment so I appreciate

589
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:48,369
you noticing that thanks for noticing

590
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:50,259
the information and care I take are

591
00:20:48,369 --> 00:20:52,869
definitely important to me I try to put

592
00:20:50,259 --> 00:20:54,819
out accurate information that is useful

593
00:20:52,869 --> 00:20:56,889
and gives you some sort of quality and

594
00:20:54,819 --> 00:20:58,359
improves your life some way give you

595
00:20:56,890 --> 00:21:01,150
some sort of value I make sure I put

596
00:20:58,359 --> 00:21:03,129
that in each show and the care it comes

597
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:05,019
from my heart everything I do grow from

598
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:07,030
my heart drum from my heart podcast from

599
00:21:05,019 --> 00:21:10,000
my heart that is from my heart so thank

600
00:21:07,029 --> 00:21:11,849
you for noticing the radio voice dude I

601
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,170
hear that a lot so it is not weird I

602
00:21:11,849 --> 00:21:15,669
can't stand my own voice in these

603
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:17,019
headphones when I listen back to edit

604
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:19,330
the show I'm like who is that [ __ ]

605
00:21:17,019 --> 00:21:21,250
rambling I can't take it so thank you

606
00:21:19,329 --> 00:21:22,449
for the compliment on the voice you

607
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:23,710
could fall asleep to that [ __ ] that's

608
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:25,990
kind of weird

609
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:27,490
I probably give people weird dreams if

610
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:29,170
you fell asleep to me I can only imagine

611
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:30,940
what kind of dreams you would have then

612
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:32,680
you wrap up with can't wait to run a

613
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:34,690
batch of a rise when they're back in

614
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:37,090
stock will guess what bro they are back

615
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:38,440
in stock so go check them out before

616
00:21:37,089 --> 00:21:41,769
they run out they should have five packs

617
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:44,529
and ten packs available at this time now

618
00:21:41,769 --> 00:21:46,089
let's focus on the nutrient part of your

619
00:21:44,529 --> 00:21:48,279
question it sounds like you've got all

620
00:21:46,089 --> 00:21:50,769
the right tools in your arsenal you've

621
00:21:48,279 --> 00:21:52,869
got the the botanic air commercial

622
00:21:50,769 --> 00:21:54,309
nutrients system lineup you've got some

623
00:21:52,869 --> 00:21:56,139
recharge in there to give yourself a

624
00:21:54,309 --> 00:21:57,909
root boost you've got cal-mag because of

625
00:21:56,140 --> 00:22:00,910
course high performance plants will get

626
00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:02,710
a cow mag deficiency and a bloom booster

627
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:04,360
later and flower it sounds like you've

628
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:06,579
got all of the right tools you've got

629
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:09,969
the right idea for the ramp up however

630
00:22:06,579 --> 00:22:12,759
you could go a little bit higher later

631
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:14,500
and flower with that botanic hairline up

632
00:22:12,759 --> 00:22:16,960
and those additives you could probably

633
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,779
push to the fifteen or sixteen hundred

634
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,690
ppm

635
00:22:17,779 --> 00:22:23,089
and not cause any problems honestly you

636
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:26,600
could probably go a little bit higher if

637
00:22:23,089 --> 00:22:28,039
you do not double up on any elements so

638
00:22:26,599 --> 00:22:30,079
if you were if you know how much

639
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:31,789
nitrogen is in each product and you know

640
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:33,019
how much phosphorus is in each product

641
00:22:31,789 --> 00:22:35,000
and you can balance it out to where you

642
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:38,029
don't overdose anything you can probably

643
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,710
go pretty high there are some variables

644
00:22:38,029 --> 00:22:42,079
I would like to know before I give too

645
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:44,450
much advice about this grow such as is

646
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:46,309
their co2 running what type of lighting

647
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:48,650
are you using I just want to know about

648
00:22:46,309 --> 00:22:50,779
your environment and your overall setup

649
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:54,230
because that would tell me where we can

650
00:22:50,779 --> 00:22:56,509
improve and if you have co2 you can

651
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:58,819
probably run a little higher ppm s if

652
00:22:56,509 --> 00:23:00,920
you've got stronger lighting the plants

653
00:22:58,819 --> 00:23:02,659
can handle higher PPM's because they

654
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:05,210
have enough light energy to metabolize

655
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:07,160
those nutrients if you've got low

656
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:08,750
quality lighting you can't feed it

657
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:10,730
strongly because they're not

658
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:12,710
metabolizing it if you've got powerful

659
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:14,990
lights and co2 you can feed the [ __ ] out

660
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:17,210
of them and you may not see any burn if

661
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:19,460
you feed that same feed regimen to a

662
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:20,809
plant that you're not authentic co2 and

663
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:23,029
you're running it under a fluorescent

664
00:23:20,809 --> 00:23:24,829
it's going to burn so with so many

665
00:23:23,029 --> 00:23:27,170
variables I have to be careful with my

666
00:23:24,829 --> 00:23:29,210
advice in my suggestions here you do

667
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:31,220
have the right idea starting low and

668
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:33,049
working your way up have you thought

669
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:35,029
about working your way up until you burn

670
00:23:33,049 --> 00:23:37,720
the [ __ ] out of one of them honestly

671
00:23:35,029 --> 00:23:39,619
that is how I find my plants limits I

672
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:41,870
increase the PPM's

673
00:23:39,619 --> 00:23:43,789
until I see I call it getting their

674
00:23:41,869 --> 00:23:45,559
nails done think about the plant leaf

675
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:47,389
looking like a hand when you see the

676
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:49,069
tips starting to get yellow or starting

677
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:51,530
to get funky colors or getting their

678
00:23:49,069 --> 00:23:53,059
nails done as soon as you see one of the

679
00:23:51,529 --> 00:23:55,579
ladies starting to get our nails done

680
00:23:53,059 --> 00:23:58,039
you know you have pushed it right to the

681
00:23:55,579 --> 00:23:59,629
limit you can either continue to go that

682
00:23:58,039 --> 00:24:01,519
hard and they'll just keep burning just

683
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:02,990
a little bit and you probably won't see

684
00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:04,849
it in the final product because you're

685
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:06,980
gonna trim off all of that leaf honestly

686
00:24:04,849 --> 00:24:08,809
and you're going to flush it also you

687
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:10,759
won't even notice so you can push it a

688
00:24:08,809 --> 00:24:12,710
little bit if you know what you're doing

689
00:24:10,759 --> 00:24:14,750
with each nutrient and you say that

690
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:16,400
you've got a good eye on the plants so I

691
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:18,859
think this may be where you're headed

692
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,480
push them see what it does now when you

693
00:24:18,859 --> 00:24:21,979
start pushing you've got to decide do I

694
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,170
want to keep pushing it and see how this

695
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:26,089
burn progresses or do I want to stop

696
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:28,039
right where I am and keep giving it that

697
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:29,009
or do I want to dial back and prevent

698
00:24:28,039 --> 00:24:30,329
more burn

699
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:31,950
that's where you have to think about it

700
00:24:30,329 --> 00:24:34,289
as a grower that's where you have to

701
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:36,509
make the decision I think the move at

702
00:24:34,289 --> 00:24:38,670
this time is to increase the PPM's later

703
00:24:36,509 --> 00:24:41,039
in Flour and see how much they can take

704
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:42,890
push it until you burn them and see if

705
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:46,230
you come out with a better harvest

706
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:47,880
you're already not satisfied so what

707
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:50,160
could go wrong are you gonna be less

708
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:52,320
satisfied if you do some experimentation

709
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:55,110
you may do an experiment and you may

710
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:56,970
improve your garden dramatically another

711
00:24:55,109 --> 00:24:59,309
thing we need to keep in mind is could

712
00:24:56,970 --> 00:25:01,950
this be a genetic issue do you simply

713
00:24:59,309 --> 00:25:03,929
have weak genetics I'm not making fun of

714
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:06,660
you I'm not calling you out I'm just

715
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:08,549
saying that this is an option genetic

716
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:10,769
potential maybe you're a limiting factor

717
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:13,200
at this time you've got deep water

718
00:25:10,769 --> 00:25:14,339
culture you've got good nutrients I said

719
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,569
earlier I don't know about your

720
00:25:14,339 --> 00:25:18,299
environment I don't know about your

721
00:25:15,569 --> 00:25:19,919
lights your air your water your soil I

722
00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:21,629
don't know about your personal attention

723
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:23,910
to the plants I don't know about that

724
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:27,120
but one thing that could be limiting you

725
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:29,009
is the genetics your email starts off by

726
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:30,989
saying that you've grown approximately

727
00:25:29,009 --> 00:25:33,269
15 plants but I really don't know if

728
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:35,220
that was the same plant 15 times or if

729
00:25:33,269 --> 00:25:37,559
you've grown 15 different seeds or 15

730
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:40,380
different cuts I really don't know but

731
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:41,940
maybe genetics are what are holding you

732
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:43,830
back so it sounds like you've got the

733
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:45,390
right nutrients I would start pushing

734
00:25:43,829 --> 00:25:47,909
them push them a little bit harder and

735
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:49,380
watch for nutrient burn once you do see

736
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:51,330
a noodle a little bit of nutrient burn

737
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:52,920
that's when you need to decide do I want

738
00:25:51,329 --> 00:25:54,539
to dial it back you will want to keep

739
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:56,700
going or do I want to go a little bit

740
00:25:54,539 --> 00:25:58,109
stronger you're in deep water culture I

741
00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:00,180
don't know if your plants are in

742
00:25:58,109 --> 00:26:02,039
individual buckets I don't know if

743
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:04,200
you've got one main reservoir feeding

744
00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:05,579
each plant but if they're in individual

745
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,620
buckets why not

746
00:26:05,579 --> 00:26:09,059
test each plant differently I don't know

747
00:26:07,619 --> 00:26:10,469
how many plants are growing maybe you've

748
00:26:09,059 --> 00:26:12,839
only got one so you've only got one

749
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:15,690
option but if you've got multiple plants

750
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:17,789
why not try one with your 1,200 max

751
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:20,250
PPM's that you're used to and Mark that

752
00:26:17,789 --> 00:26:21,869
plant the one getting fed low ppm s then

753
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:24,690
mark the other plant the one getting fed

754
00:26:21,869 --> 00:26:26,579
medium PPM's and go to 14 with that one

755
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:28,380
then take another one and hit it at 16

756
00:26:26,579 --> 00:26:30,359
then get another one and feed it all the

757
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:32,130
way up to 18 and feed another one all

758
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:34,709
the way up to 20 and see what happens

759
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:35,610
some of them will burn some of them will

760
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:37,829
definitely show you

761
00:26:35,609 --> 00:26:39,929
nitrogen toxicity or some sort of a

762
00:26:37,829 --> 00:26:42,119
phosphorus overdose you will see some

763
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:42,779
sort of a problem that's how you know

764
00:26:42,119 --> 00:26:44,849
what those

765
00:26:42,779 --> 00:26:47,789
it's can take honestly that's how I

766
00:26:44,849 --> 00:26:49,409
became an advanced skill level grower I

767
00:26:47,789 --> 00:26:52,019
[ __ ] a lot of things up just by

768
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:53,460
experimenting and trying and I

769
00:26:52,019 --> 00:26:55,019
understand that your plants are precious

770
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:56,759
to you and that every plant counts and

771
00:26:55,019 --> 00:26:58,170
that you need that harvest but if you

772
00:26:56,759 --> 00:27:01,379
want to take your grow to the next level

773
00:26:58,170 --> 00:27:03,300
you may have to take some risks it may

774
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:06,240
cost you one or two plants but that

775
00:27:03,299 --> 00:27:08,159
experience is invaluable if you can take

776
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,019
your crop from what did you say average

777
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:12,870
to probably below average to

778
00:27:10,019 --> 00:27:14,940
above-average and [ __ ] stellar it may

779
00:27:12,869 --> 00:27:16,889
be worth killing two or three maybe four

780
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:19,440
or five plants just to see what they can

781
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:21,330
take now another thing I want to talk

782
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:25,350
about is you said you were using the

783
00:27:21,329 --> 00:27:27,359
botanic air C&amp;S 17 product line I am

784
00:27:25,349 --> 00:27:29,309
going to open the botanic air website

785
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:30,929
and I'm going to open the nutrient

786
00:27:29,309 --> 00:27:32,909
calculator they have a nutrient

787
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:35,610
calculator right here on the website and

788
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:37,620
this allows me to punch in what type of

789
00:27:35,609 --> 00:27:40,169
base nutrients we're going to use we're

790
00:27:37,619 --> 00:27:42,149
going to use the cns 17 bloom based

791
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:43,890
nutrient we're going to measure our

792
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:45,300
product and milliliters I'm going to

793
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:46,950
type in that we have a one gallon

794
00:27:45,299 --> 00:27:49,200
reservoir just to keep this simple

795
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:50,880
it wants grow time we're gonna say we're

796
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,259
gonna grow for four weeks we will bloom

797
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,520
for nine weeks this is just a

798
00:27:52,259 --> 00:27:54,869
hypothetical for the case of this

799
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:57,809
podcast so I can give you some advice

800
00:27:54,869 --> 00:28:00,659
here now on the botanic air website on

801
00:27:57,809 --> 00:28:03,899
their official nutrient calculator on

802
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:06,529
the bloom phase for week one of flower

803
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:10,200
it is recommending that I use 13

804
00:28:06,529 --> 00:28:14,759
milliliters of the cns 17 bloom nutrient

805
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:17,190
that is going to put my PPM's at 910 now

806
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:21,329
the next week they increase that dosage

807
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:24,960
to 17 milliliters per gallon and that

808
00:28:21,329 --> 00:28:29,399
continues all the way through week 8 now

809
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:33,079
if I correctly add 17 milliliters of CNS

810
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:35,430
17 bloom base nutrients to my water

811
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:41,039
according to this speed chart that is

812
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:43,320
going to bring my PPM's to 1190 which is

813
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:45,899
very close to the 1200 number that you

814
00:28:43,319 --> 00:28:48,769
said you were ramping up to now Botanica

815
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:52,710
is recommending you start week 2 at 10

816
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:54,720
ppm below where you are maxing out so

817
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:56,400
this chart on this website is telling us

818
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,740
that your PP ends of your

819
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:00,870
nutrients are way low and you need to

820
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:02,880
increase your nutrient feedings of your

821
00:29:00,869 --> 00:29:05,489
plants earlier in the flowering phase

822
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:07,710
now I do preach that these nutrient

823
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:09,930
companies suggest you use more product

824
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:12,029
than necessary so that they can sell you

825
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:14,430
more but they wouldn't suggest enough to

826
00:29:12,029 --> 00:29:16,710
blatantly burn your plants so let's push

827
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:19,350
it according to their chart and see how

828
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:20,940
the plants react on their suggestion now

829
00:29:19,349 --> 00:29:22,558
I don't doubt your skills I don't know

830
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:25,200
who you are I want to make this really

831
00:29:22,558 --> 00:29:29,220
simple for everybody the way to achieve

832
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:31,830
that specific ppm test in your nutrients

833
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:34,620
is to start with clean water water with

834
00:29:31,829 --> 00:29:36,269
0 ppm s that is RO water if you've got

835
00:29:34,619 --> 00:29:38,189
City tap water there's going to be

836
00:29:36,269 --> 00:29:40,259
something in there already measure that

837
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:42,360
write down your baseline see where

838
00:29:40,259 --> 00:29:44,819
you're starting then you have your

839
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:46,829
amount of water probably five gallons

840
00:29:44,819 --> 00:29:49,589
maybe more depending on your situation

841
00:29:46,829 --> 00:29:51,629
put your ppm meter in there pour in that

842
00:29:49,589 --> 00:29:54,419
base nutrient give it a stir see what

843
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:56,460
the meter says if it doesn't say 1190

844
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:59,610
pour in a little more your goal is to

845
00:29:56,460 --> 00:30:01,140
get that ppm to eleven ninety once

846
00:29:59,609 --> 00:30:04,349
you've got your base nutrient at the

847
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:06,690
correct PPM's then add your additives at

848
00:30:04,349 --> 00:30:08,039
the recommended dosage I would suggest

849
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:10,350
you check the PPM's

850
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:11,789
after you add each additive so you've

851
00:30:10,349 --> 00:30:13,709
got your base nutrient in there what are

852
00:30:11,789 --> 00:30:15,029
you gonna add next maybe your cal-mag so

853
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:17,160
measure out your two milliliters per

854
00:30:15,029 --> 00:30:20,190
gallon of cal-mag and pour it in there

855
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:22,350
then put your ppm pen back in there give

856
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:24,539
it a swirl and write down what the ppm s

857
00:30:22,349 --> 00:30:28,349
are at this point now you know how many

858
00:30:24,539 --> 00:30:30,178
ppm of cal-mag are in your solution take

859
00:30:28,349 --> 00:30:32,519
the number that appears on your ppm

860
00:30:30,179 --> 00:30:34,590
meter and subtract eleven ninety because

861
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:37,049
that is how much base nutrient we added

862
00:30:34,589 --> 00:30:39,959
the remaining math is how much cal-mag

863
00:30:37,049 --> 00:30:41,819
is in your solution continue this with

864
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:44,700
all of your additives write it all down

865
00:30:41,819 --> 00:30:46,950
feed your plants pay attention over the

866
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:49,230
next few days and see how they react if

867
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:50,850
the plants look angry we [ __ ] up we

868
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:52,829
need to reduce the nutrients but now we

869
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:55,230
know what they can take if the plants

870
00:30:52,829 --> 00:30:58,139
explode with vigorous growth we know

871
00:30:55,230 --> 00:31:00,750
we're on the right path to fixing your

872
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:01,259
dissatisfaction so if you haven't

873
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:03,150
already

874
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:04,920
I suggest you head over to the botanic

875
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:06,810
air website and check out their nutrient

876
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:09,240
calculator and play around with it a

877
00:31:06,809 --> 00:31:09,788
little bit put in the cns 17 base and

878
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,470
then

879
00:31:09,788 --> 00:31:13,960
and see what it suggests you feed at

880
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:15,548
each week then add a few things to the

881
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:17,169
chart and if you can afford a new

882
00:31:15,548 --> 00:31:19,058
product I would recommend the liquid

883
00:31:17,169 --> 00:31:21,278
karma as the next thing you add to that

884
00:31:19,058 --> 00:31:22,989
lineup add that to your feed chart see

885
00:31:21,278 --> 00:31:24,700
how much of it to mix in and add that

886
00:31:22,989 --> 00:31:27,340
right to your lineup that will improve

887
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:29,319
the quality of your finished product and

888
00:31:27,339 --> 00:31:31,959
you guys if you're not using botanic air

889
00:31:29,319 --> 00:31:34,808
most of the major nutrient companies

890
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:37,808
will have a nutrient calculator on their

891
00:31:34,808 --> 00:31:40,298
website again these companies do want us

892
00:31:37,808 --> 00:31:42,788
to buy more than necessary so they may

893
00:31:40,298 --> 00:31:44,679
tell us to use a little bit extra so

894
00:31:42,788 --> 00:31:46,720
follow the same advice that I gave our

895
00:31:44,679 --> 00:31:49,028
friend here start low start with maybe

896
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:50,950
50 or 75 percent of the recommended

897
00:31:49,028 --> 00:31:52,839
dosage off the website and then work

898
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:54,489
your way up to a hundred percent if you

899
00:31:52,839 --> 00:31:56,378
feel like the plants can take it the

900
00:31:54,489 --> 00:31:58,569
reason I like those nutrient calculators

901
00:31:56,378 --> 00:32:00,699
is because it shows you the breakdown of

902
00:31:58,569 --> 00:32:03,308
what you can be feeding your garden and

903
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:05,379
it shows you correct ratios you may not

904
00:32:03,308 --> 00:32:07,089
want to use every product on that chart

905
00:32:05,378 --> 00:32:08,769
but it kind of gives you a ratio and

906
00:32:07,089 --> 00:32:11,138
shows you if you use this much of the

907
00:32:08,769 --> 00:32:12,909
base let's just say if you use two parts

908
00:32:11,138 --> 00:32:14,589
of the base you may want to use one part

909
00:32:12,909 --> 00:32:16,450
of this bloom booster and then a quarter

910
00:32:14,589 --> 00:32:18,038
part of this root inoculant they just

911
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:20,019
give you good ideas it may suggest

912
00:32:18,038 --> 00:32:22,388
things you were missing and I feel like

913
00:32:20,019 --> 00:32:24,399
it is a good baseline recipe for a new

914
00:32:22,388 --> 00:32:26,678
grower it was a little bit overwhelmed

915
00:32:24,398 --> 00:32:30,098
and confused by starting a brand new

916
00:32:26,679 --> 00:32:32,440
nutrient regimen now I hope that helps

917
00:32:30,098 --> 00:32:34,598
you improve the quality of your finished

918
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:36,639
product don't be afraid to burn a couple

919
00:32:34,598 --> 00:32:38,888
of plants for the sake of overall

920
00:32:36,638 --> 00:32:40,238
improvement I want to thank you guys for

921
