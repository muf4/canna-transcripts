4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,699
sat down to record I was told that there

5
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:14,669
was a death in my family so I am really

6
00:00:11,699 --> 00:00:17,100
not in the mood or in the right mind to

7
00:00:14,669 --> 00:00:18,778
record a podcast I wanted to come on

8
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,210

9
00:00:18,778 --> 00:00:23,070
support that you've shown to the podcast

00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:24,868

14
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:33,030
family and I've got a lot to deal with

15
00:00:30,778 --> 00:00:35,850

16
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:37,950
podcast momentarily I may be away from

17
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:39,809
social media for a couple of days I just

18
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:41,700
need a break I need to take good care of

19
00:00:39,808 --> 00:00:44,039
my family I need to get my head right I

20
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,680
may be a way for a funeral here very

21
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:48,750
soon don't worry the podcast is not

22
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:51,058

23
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:53,100
regroup and handle my family and handle

24
00:00:51,058 --> 00:00:55,409
my life and then I will be back with
