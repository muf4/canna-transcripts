the patreon campaign all right now let's

58
00:02:27,849 --> 00:02:31,120
work our way into the fun part of the

59
00:02:29,469 --> 00:02:33,639
show I hinted that I wanted to talk

60
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,860
about something it recently happened at

61
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:38,139
the bank so let's get right into that I

62
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:40,510
recently decided that it would be a wise

63
00:02:38,139 --> 00:02:41,919
move to have another business bank

64
00:02:40,509 --> 00:02:44,109
account we don't need to get into any of

65
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:45,699
those details here it was necessary so I

66
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:48,010
went to the bank and I explained to them

67
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:50,560
my needs and what I wanted to do and

68
00:02:48,009 --> 00:02:52,599
they were happy to help me out a very

69
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,099
nice lady took me to her office I filled

70
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:56,289
out some paperwork she asked me a few

71
00:02:54,099 --> 00:02:58,150
questions then she started typing some

72
00:02:56,289 --> 00:03:00,489
details into the computer and that was

73
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:03,129
when she informed me that I would not be

74
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:06,129
allowed to open a business checking or

75
00:03:03,129 --> 00:03:08,530
savings account with her bank I feel

76
00:03:06,129 --> 00:03:10,719
like I immediately knew why but I chose

77
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:12,849
to play dumb I said well why is that

78
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:15,639
ma'am and she said because you are

79
00:03:12,849 --> 00:03:18,250
currently a key holder and we cannot

80
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:21,279
offer a business banking account to

81
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:23,530
anybody who is a key holder and I said

82
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,509
what do you mean key holder I don't work

83
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:27,099
anywhere else I have my own business and

84
00:03:25,509 --> 00:03:29,229
I just played dumb because I wanted to

85
00:03:27,099 --> 00:03:32,199
see where this would go and she informed

86
00:03:29,229 --> 00:03:35,169
me that her computer indicated to her

87
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:38,289
that I have a Colorado marijuana

88
00:03:35,169 --> 00:03:41,339
Enforcement Division key position badge

89
00:03:38,289 --> 00:03:44,459
now let me briefly explain this badge

90
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:46,930
anybody who works in a legal cannabis

91
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:50,409
facility in the state of Colorado is

92
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:53,049
required to have a Colorado marijuana

93
00:03:50,409 --> 00:03:55,419
Enforcement Division badge and that

94
00:03:53,049 --> 00:03:57,640
requires an intensive background check

95
00:03:55,419 --> 00:04:00,099
it requires thorough fingerprinting and

96
00:03:57,639 --> 00:04:02,619
it requires a lot of questionnaires and

97
00:04:00,099 --> 00:04:05,019
a little bit of money anybody who wants

98
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:07,360
to work in the industry is required to

99
00:04:05,019 --> 00:04:09,370
have this badge there are multiple

100
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,070
badges available at different levels

101
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:13,599
those different levels of badges give

102
00:04:12,069 --> 00:04:15,459
you different opportunities and

103
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:18,250
availability for different positions in

104
00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:19,930
the facilities most folks will have what

105
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:21,788
is called a support badge that is for

106
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:23,650
somebody who would be a trimmer or an

107
00:04:21,788 --> 00:04:25,899
assistant grower if you are going to

108
00:04:23,649 --> 00:04:27,179
have keys or make decisions you get what

109
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:29,339
is called a key back

110
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:31,259
if you are an owner you've got a red

111
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:33,539
badge and it means you own the place

112
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:35,009
there are transportation badges and

113
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,780
there are changes happening to the

114
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:38,939
badging system as we speak so by the

115
00:04:36,779 --> 00:04:40,769
time this episode comes out this could

116
00:04:38,939 --> 00:04:42,810
be inaccurate information but at this

117
00:04:40,769 --> 00:04:44,069
time there are three badges that I'm

118
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:45,720
aware of possibly a fourth

119
00:04:44,069 --> 00:04:48,089
transportation badge that I don't pay

120
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,949
attention to but the support the key and

121
00:04:48,089 --> 00:04:52,079
the owner badge are the main badges I

122
00:04:49,949 --> 00:04:54,120
think about I hold a support badge I'm

123
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:55,439
not the owner and I'm not a trimmer I am

124
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,569
somebody who has hands-on with the

125
00:04:55,439 --> 00:05:00,509
plants and I make decisions about what

126
00:04:57,569 --> 00:05:02,969
happens in the facility therefore the

127
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:06,689
bank has decided that they cannot offer

128
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:09,060
me any type of loan or accounts with

129
00:05:06,689 --> 00:05:12,000
their establishment their reasoning for

130
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:15,089
this is since my source of income my

131
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,970
legal employment is federally illegal

132
00:05:15,089 --> 00:05:20,819
they cannot risk taking my money and

133
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:24,300
banking with me because they are insured

134
00:05:20,819 --> 00:05:26,699
by the FDIC which is federal so my

135
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:28,889
income is federally illegal they are a

136
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:31,319
federal institution they don't want to

137
00:05:28,889 --> 00:05:33,090
mix my dirty federally illegal money

138
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:35,639
into their federally regulated

139
00:05:33,089 --> 00:05:37,589
institution so they simply smiled at me

140
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:40,288
and said thank you for coming but we

141
00:05:37,589 --> 00:05:42,418
simply cannot and will not help you so I

142
00:05:40,288 --> 00:05:44,339
took the opportunity to ask them if they

143
00:05:42,418 --> 00:05:46,319
had any recommendations are there any

144
00:05:44,339 --> 00:05:48,659
other banks in the area that may be able

145
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:51,538
to service me and they said that this

146
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:53,760
new computer system Flags everybody with

147
00:05:51,538 --> 00:05:56,159
a marijuana Enforcement Division badge

148
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:58,288
in their computer system when they

149
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,760
attempt to establish a new account she

150
00:05:58,288 --> 00:06:01,409
said is something that is linked to

151
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,120
their computer they are directly linked

152
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:05,520
to the marijuana Enforcement Division I

153
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:08,189
don't think she was purposefully looking

154
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:10,019
to find my badge but it popped up and it

155
00:06:08,189 --> 00:06:11,910
did not take her two minutes of typing

156
00:06:10,019 --> 00:06:14,069
into that computer to have all of my

157
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:16,650
information and then when I played dumb

158
00:06:14,069 --> 00:06:18,870
about having the badge she recited my

159
00:06:16,649 --> 00:06:21,269
badge number and told me the expiration

160
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:22,978
date of my badge then she was kind

161
00:06:21,269 --> 00:06:25,049
enough to tell me that when that badge

162
00:06:22,978 --> 00:06:27,149
expires she would be more than happy to

163
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:30,060
open an account for me to come back in

164
00:06:27,149 --> 00:06:32,939
December and we can do business she did

165
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:35,339
also indicate that if I lower my level

166
00:06:32,939 --> 00:06:37,050
of my badge that then they could write a

167
00:06:35,339 --> 00:06:39,418
letter to the bank and they would

168
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:40,650
consider giving me the services that I

169
00:06:39,418 --> 00:06:43,139
require but I

170
00:06:40,649 --> 00:06:45,060
don't want to reduce the level of badge

171
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:46,829
I have got right now because I need that

172
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:49,949
for my work in the legal cannabis

173
00:06:46,829 --> 00:06:52,649
industry in a legal cannabis cultivation

174
00:06:49,949 --> 00:06:55,978
facility to remain compliant you must

175
00:06:52,649 --> 00:06:59,008
have a key badge holder on scene at all

176
00:06:55,978 --> 00:07:00,930
times so if I am at a facility where I'm

177
00:06:59,009 --> 00:07:03,030
registered as an employee I am on the

178
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:03,538
employee roster list I have got my key

179
00:07:03,029 --> 00:07:06,059
badge

180
00:07:03,538 --> 00:07:07,800
nobody has to babysit me they can say go

181
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:09,870
do your work Jeff go look at the grow go

182
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,520
inspect the grow go make the adjustments

183
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:12,899
you need to make have a good time they

184
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:14,490
can give me free rein of the grow and

185
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:17,009
nobody has to babysit me

186
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:19,470
if I only had a support badge there

187
00:07:17,009 --> 00:07:21,478
would have to be somebody within visual

188
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:23,699
distance of me at all times I would not

189
00:07:21,478 --> 00:07:25,769
be allowed to roam around that grow or

190
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:27,600
those grows or those cultivation areas

191
00:07:25,769 --> 00:07:29,430
at my own free will I would need a

192
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:31,320
babysitter I would need some sort of an

193
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:34,050
escort I couldn't be in the cultivation

194
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:35,909
facilities by myself so at this time I

195
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:38,340
need that key badge so that I can

196
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:40,770
function and do my job properly so at

197
00:07:38,339 --> 00:07:42,569
this time I am exploring more options

198
00:07:40,769 --> 00:07:45,269
because I am sure that there are other

199
00:07:42,569 --> 00:07:47,939
people like myself who are in the

200
00:07:45,269 --> 00:07:51,180
medical cannabis industry who also may

201
00:07:47,939 --> 00:07:53,610
own a small business who also may need

202
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:55,949
to get a bank loan for a vehicle who

203
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:58,590
also may need to get a bank loan for a

204
00:07:55,949 --> 00:08:00,330
new home who also may just need banking

205
00:07:58,589 --> 00:08:02,339
services because we need banks in

206
00:08:00,329 --> 00:08:04,829
general I have heard of many other

207
00:08:02,339 --> 00:08:06,329
people having similar experiences with

208
00:08:04,829 --> 00:08:08,399
banking I have heard of friends having a

209
00:08:06,329 --> 00:08:10,500
cow shut down I have seen friends have

210
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:12,478
their business accounts closed I have

211
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,970
seen and heard of people being denied

212
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:16,620
requests for loans and being denied the

213
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:18,210
ability to open a new checking or

214
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:20,759
savings account but I have never been

215
00:08:18,209 --> 00:08:22,829
discriminated against like this since we

216
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:25,110
have fully legalized cannabis there were

217
00:08:22,829 --> 00:08:26,579
times when cannabis was becoming freshly

218
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:27,870
legalized and people were still kind of

219
00:08:26,579 --> 00:08:29,250
weird about it there were a few

220
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:30,930
restaurants that would treat us weird

221
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:32,969
when we showed up stinking like dank and

222
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:35,038
paid in a bunch of cash but since then I

223
00:08:32,969 --> 00:08:37,289
haven't felt that kind of rejection or

224
00:08:35,038 --> 00:08:39,658
discrimination from a business and it

225
00:08:37,288 --> 00:08:42,240
was really uncomfortable so I am looking

226
00:08:39,658 --> 00:08:43,860
into solutions I did ask this lady if

227
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,370
there were any other options

228
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:49,680
she said that credit unions may be able

229
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:51,990
to help out with my situation now in

230
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:54,239
many banking circumstances people with a

231
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:56,339
key badge or people with a support badge

232
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,259
she'd be able to attain a normal

233
00:08:56,339 --> 00:09:00,240
checking or savings account what I was

234
00:08:58,259 --> 00:09:01,889
trying to get was a small business

235
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,079
checking account so that I can have a

236
00:09:01,889 --> 00:09:05,818
tax account where I just put money in

237
00:09:04,078 --> 00:09:06,508
for taxes and don't spend it when tax

238
00:09:05,818 --> 00:09:07,979
time comes

239
00:09:06,509 --> 00:09:09,449
I've got tax when he's sitting there it

240
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,909
comes right out of that account that was

241
00:09:09,448 --> 00:09:14,519
my intention but this bank has refused

242
00:09:11,909 --> 00:09:16,019
to open my back up tax account so I just

243
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:18,360
got to pay my taxes out of my normal

244
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:19,980
business account not a big deal but not

245
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,568
what I wanted to do with my business

246
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:23,220
with my money I feel like I should be

247
00:09:21,568 --> 00:09:24,899
able to put my money in the bank and

248
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:27,209
manage my money just like anybody else

249
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:28,980
because I worked for it legally just

250
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:31,138
like everybody else it feels kind of

251
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:33,119
shitty this is one of the ancillary

252
00:09:31,139 --> 00:09:35,369
issues that we did not think about when

253
00:09:33,119 --> 00:09:38,189
it came to legalizing cannabis this is

254
00:09:35,369 --> 00:09:40,678
going to be an issue in every new legal

255
00:09:38,188 --> 00:09:43,469
market until cannabis is federally legal

256
00:09:40,678 --> 00:09:45,299
this will be a hurdle for everybody this

257
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:47,009
is a hurdle for businesses that are

258
00:09:45,299 --> 00:09:48,748
trying to open this is a hurdle for

259
00:09:47,009 --> 00:09:50,879
people who work in the industry or who

260
00:09:48,749 --> 00:09:52,769
are trying to live a legitimate life the

261
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:55,769
people who work in these grows are not

262
00:09:52,769 --> 00:09:58,798
all STONER pothead Bros there are people

263
00:09:55,769 --> 00:09:59,789
of all walks of life of all ages working

264
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:01,948
in these facilities

265
00:09:59,789 --> 00:10:04,259
there are cultivators there are trimmers

266
00:10:01,948 --> 00:10:06,419
but there are also lawyers and

267
00:10:04,259 --> 00:10:08,399
accountants and compliance managers and

268
00:10:06,419 --> 00:10:10,678
people who live a completely different

269
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:13,048
life than anybody who has ever been in

270
00:10:10,678 --> 00:10:15,360
the illegal side of the cannabis

271
00:10:13,048 --> 00:10:17,970
industry it is a legal business now and

272
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,428
the majority of the people want to live

273
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:22,139
like upstanding legal citizens so it's a

274
00:10:20,428 --> 00:10:24,240
little frustrating it's a little bit of

275
00:10:22,139 --> 00:10:25,889
a slap in the face that we're able to go

276
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,230
to work every day and they take

277
00:10:25,889 --> 00:10:29,970
employment taxes out of our check then

278
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:31,980
all of those cannabis businesses have to

279
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:33,899
pay their taxes but when it comes to

280
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:36,119
having a bank account they don't want

281
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:37,708
anything to do with us I think that's

282
00:10:36,119 --> 00:10:39,420
kind of a slap in the face I think it's

283
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:40,948
kind of [ __ ] that we can't have a

284
00:10:39,419 --> 00:10:42,719
bank account because it's federally

285
00:10:40,948 --> 00:10:44,969
illegal but you'll take my tax money

286
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,559
even though it's federally illegal you

287
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:48,089
should pick one you can't have my dirty

288
00:10:46,558 --> 00:10:48,749
money if it's dirty money you shouldn't

289
00:10:48,089 --> 00:10:50,189
get it at all

290
00:10:48,749 --> 00:10:51,808
I don't know why once you take it it

291
00:10:50,188 --> 00:10:53,578
becomes clean now since it was dirty

292
00:10:51,808 --> 00:10:55,289
when I had it that's [ __ ]

293
00:10:53,578 --> 00:10:56,729
but that's just a side rant this is

294
00:10:55,289 --> 00:10:59,578
going to be a problem everywhere

295
00:10:56,730 --> 00:11:01,139
cannabis gets legalized so be prepared

296
00:10:59,578 --> 00:11:02,878
for that think about that if you were

297
00:11:01,139 --> 00:11:03,959
trying to open a business think about

298
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:06,629
that if you were trying to be in the

299
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:07,949
industry sometimes it may be challenging

300
00:11:06,629 --> 00:11:09,870
establishing

301
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:12,060
maintaining your credit and your bank

302
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:14,429
accounts now like I said a moment ago I

303
00:11:12,059 --> 00:11:16,949
am looking for solutions credit unions

304
00:11:14,429 --> 00:11:19,049
may be the option I was told there are a

305
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:20,670
couple of banks here in my area bill

306
00:11:19,049 --> 00:11:23,339
will work with people in the cannabis

307
00:11:20,669 --> 00:11:25,679
industry again most of the time it is

308
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:27,480
easy to get an account if you only have

309
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:29,549
the support badge and if you are looking

310
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:31,710
for a personal account my struggle is

311
00:11:29,549 --> 00:11:33,689
that I have got the key badge which

312
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:35,519
gives me too much access to too many

313
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:37,620
things is what the lady said she said

314
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,750
you've got access to everything the safe

315
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:42,179
the money the product she said that I am

316
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:44,850
too deeply involved is why they make the

317
00:11:42,179 --> 00:11:47,699
differential between the key badge and

318
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:49,350
the support badge but my key badge and

319
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:51,900
the fact that I was trying to open a

320
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:53,759
business checking account flagged my

321
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:56,759
account and they refused to give me

322
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:58,860
service so I left the bank unsatisfied I

323
00:11:56,759 --> 00:12:00,960
sat there for probably an hour waiting

324
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:03,779
for an appointment it was a total waste

325
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:05,610
of time now there are rules and laws in

326
00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:07,259
the works and things are being discussed

327
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:09,269
but until those things are implemented

328
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:11,370
it is still going to be frustrating for

329
00:12:09,269 --> 00:12:13,350
some folks in this industry all right

330
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:16,019
let's move away from banking and talk a

331
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:18,300
little bit about cannabis cultivation I

332
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:20,069
will send a very great message through

333
00:12:18,299 --> 00:12:21,389
my youtube channel somebody comments it

334
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:23,070
on the YouTube channel I am scrolling

335
00:12:21,389 --> 00:12:25,199
through my messages right now to find it

336
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:27,180
here we go this one came from a person

337
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,220
who calls themselves real rasher on

338
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:32,059
YouTube they commented on one of my

339
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:34,470
videos and the comment goes like this

340
00:12:32,059 --> 00:12:36,500
couldn't you harvest one branch at a

341
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:39,240
time a week apart for several weeks

342
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:42,929
wouldn't that also be a way to gauge a

343
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:45,240
preferred maturation in one grow or with

344
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:47,099
the stress of each harvest alter the

345
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,840
remaining branches so this was a

346
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:51,450
question based on the harvest time

347
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:53,009
podcast episode we're talking about when

348
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:55,740
to harvest and how to determine ripeness

349
00:12:53,009 --> 00:12:58,350
this person is asking if we can harvest

350
00:12:55,740 --> 00:13:00,960
the plant in multiple phases maybe

351
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:03,210
taking one branch at a time for a week

352
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:05,340
and then continuing that for multiple

353
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:09,120
weeks until we have harvested the entire

354
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:11,550
plant that is an option that does work

355
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:14,220
for people growing one or two plants

356
00:13:11,549 --> 00:13:16,019
outdoors there is nothing stopping you

357
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:18,509
from taking that top cola that's nice

358
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:20,250
and finished that will allow light to

359
00:13:18,509 --> 00:13:21,450
get to some of those lower buds it'll

360
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,590
speed them up they'll also

361
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:24,210
get more light they'll get fatter

362
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:25,950
they'll get more density you'll have

363
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:28,110
more overall bud there it will also

364
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:30,300
allow more time for them to ripen up

365
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:32,100
then you can take those top buds again

366
00:13:30,299 --> 00:13:34,049
and maybe have a third harvest of some

367
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:35,490
lower buds I wouldn't really do it

368
00:13:34,049 --> 00:13:37,259
branch by branch that's gonna be a

369
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:39,299
little bit too tedious that's gonna

370
00:13:37,259 --> 00:13:40,529
leave you too many days apart between

371
00:13:39,299 --> 00:13:42,689
your branches that are cut you're gonna

372
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:44,669
have to be trimming a branch every day

373
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:46,500
you cut a few days later there's more

374
00:13:44,669 --> 00:13:48,870
work to do you cut a branch you've got a

375
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:50,309
defoliant it's gonna hang in a few days

376
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:52,320
it's gonna Drive and you've got to do

377
00:13:50,309 --> 00:13:53,639
work to it a couple more days from there

378
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,810
you've got to do more work to it you've

379
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:56,460
got to trim it you've got to dry and

380
00:13:54,809 --> 00:13:58,229
cure it so if you've got a bunch of

381
00:13:56,460 --> 00:14:00,150
branches that are three days apart it's

382
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:01,830
really going to make your drying and

383
00:14:00,149 --> 00:14:02,519
curing process kind of a staggered

384
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:05,700
pain-in-the-ass

385
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:07,470
I would do it in two maybe three phases

386
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:09,629
if you were going to stagger it I would

387
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:11,610
do that top the main top section that's

388
00:14:09,629 --> 00:14:13,320
really done then leave the middle and

389
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:15,180
take that middle and it finishes then

390
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:17,820
take the bottom if you're going to do it

391
00:14:15,179 --> 00:14:20,609
in staggered phases at all I don't like

392
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:22,530
this method for several reasons mainly

393
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:24,870
because I am a commercial cultivator

394
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:27,689
when it's harvest time I cut everything

395
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:30,960
down I clean the room and I refill it so

396
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:34,620
there is zero downtime every square foot

397
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:36,750
of space in my facility is worth dollars

398
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:39,240
so having plants that are just waiting

399
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:41,460
to finish in some spots and not able to

400
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:43,560
refill the entire room and starter start

401
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:45,660
over completely gets frustrating in a

402
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:47,519
commercial environment we grow plants

403
00:14:45,659 --> 00:14:49,919
that we know are going to be done at

404
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:52,379
sixty three days and a day sixty three

405
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:53,669
days they all come down and I can refill

406
00:14:52,379 --> 00:14:56,460
it with more plants that take

407
00:14:53,669 --> 00:14:59,009
sixty-three days I can stay on a cycle I

408
00:14:56,460 --> 00:15:02,190
can pull five point seven seven harvests

409
00:14:59,009 --> 00:15:03,840
per room per year on that rate if I put

410
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:06,510
eight week plants in there I can pull

411
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:08,100
six full harvests in there but I need to

412
00:15:06,509 --> 00:15:10,200
stay on schedule because when I fall

413
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:12,120
behind schedule money doesn't come in at

414
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:14,490
the time we need it then paychecks can't

415
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:16,769
happen rent can't happen utility bills

416
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:18,990
can't happen everything falls to [ __ ] so

417
00:15:16,769 --> 00:15:21,029
I have to stay on schedule that is my

418
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:22,799
main reason for not doing this type of a

419
00:15:21,029 --> 00:15:25,740
thing in a commercial environment I

420
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:28,349
simply want to cut and clean and restart

421
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:30,539
and again I also don't want my trim crew

422
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:32,399
cutting half of a plant and having to

423
00:15:30,539 --> 00:15:33,779
deal with half of that plant and coming

424
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,620
back a few days later and cutting the

425
00:15:33,779 --> 00:15:36,149
other half of

426
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:38,610
plan and now we've got two different

427
00:15:36,149 --> 00:15:39,840
harvest batches that are one week apart

428
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:42,269
and we've got to dry and cure these

429
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:44,550
[ __ ] a week apart it makes a problem

430
00:15:42,269 --> 00:15:47,189
when it is on a large scale in your

431
00:15:44,549 --> 00:15:47,939
small personal grow this would work

432
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:50,270
beautifully

433
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:52,860
especially in an outdoor environment

434
00:15:50,269 --> 00:15:56,429
part of your question was will this

435
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:58,289
stress the plant possibly depending on

436
00:15:56,429 --> 00:16:00,149
the genetics of your plant depending on

437
00:15:58,289 --> 00:16:01,740
how rough you are depending on how late

438
00:16:00,149 --> 00:16:05,250
or early you decide to start chopping

439
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:07,289
this could very well stress the plant if

440
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:09,120
you take the top and you're a little bit

441
00:16:07,289 --> 00:16:11,969
too rough or you pissed that plant off

442
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:14,879
you could cause some stress to the lower

443
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:16,830
parts of the plants but if all things go

444
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:19,049
well you're going to cut it down in

445
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:21,090
seven to ten maybe fourteen days anyway

446
00:16:19,049 --> 00:16:23,250
so none of those problems will have a

447
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:25,110
chance to present themselves you may

448
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:26,399
piss the plant off but it's not gonna

449
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:28,830
hermaphrodites

450
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:30,809
it's not going to spit out seeds on you

451
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:32,400
overnight and if it does her him on you

452
00:16:30,809 --> 00:16:34,289
overnight it's not going to cause any

453
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,179
problems that quickly if you're paying

454
00:16:34,289 --> 00:16:37,709
attention you'll see some hermaphrodite

455
00:16:36,179 --> 00:16:39,779
flowers you'll be able to cut down the

456
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:42,300
plant before any of those flowers cause

457
00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:43,980
any problems and honestly if you see

458
00:16:42,299 --> 00:16:45,629
hermaphrodite flowers that laid into the

459
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:47,310
grow there's nothing to pollinate

460
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:49,409
because it is way too late to pollinate

461
00:16:47,309 --> 00:16:50,879
that plant there aren't any other plants

462
00:16:49,409 --> 00:16:52,620
that are available for pollen that late

463
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:53,309
in the season so it should not be a

464
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:56,220
problem

465
00:16:53,309 --> 00:16:58,049
so technically yes you could start

466
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:59,370
harvesting the top and then you could

467
00:16:58,049 --> 00:17:00,719
wait a few days and you could take the

468
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:02,429
middle and then you could wait another

469
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,470
week and take the bottom or you could

470
00:17:02,429 --> 00:17:06,899
just do it in two phases but I wouldn't

471
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:08,789
do it branch by branch that is going to

472
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:11,400
be tedious it's gonna be frustrating and

473
00:17:08,789 --> 00:17:13,409
that will stress out the plant but

474
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:15,210
harvesting your personal outdoor crop in

475
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:17,820
two or three chunks should not present

476
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:19,170
too many problems if you have a big

477
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:21,929
harvest that you can't manage by

478
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:24,330
yourself in one move now I know most

479
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:26,100
people are looking for peak ripeness out

480
00:17:24,329 --> 00:17:28,109
of their trichomes and they want every

481
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:31,500
bud to be just perfect before they

482
00:17:28,109 --> 00:17:33,419
harvest unless your plant is gigantic I

483
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:35,730
don't think you're going to notice much

484
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:37,830
difference in the buzz from the buds at

485
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:40,620
the top and the buzz at the bottom if we

486
00:17:37,829 --> 00:17:42,750
cut the plant down on one day and we dry

487
00:17:40,619 --> 00:17:44,339
it and cure it and smoke a bud from the

488
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:45,900
top and a bud from the bottom even

489
00:17:44,339 --> 00:17:48,509
though those top buds are a little more

490
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:50,220
done I don't think you will notice

491
00:17:48,509 --> 00:17:53,430
much of a difference unless you were

492
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:55,110
like an absolute super connoisseur I

493
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:56,970
really don't think you're gonna notice

494
00:17:55,109 --> 00:17:58,829
much of a difference and most of the

495
00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:01,079
time once those buds make it to the bag

496
00:17:58,829 --> 00:18:02,789
or to the jar they all mix up anyway and

497
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:04,470
then you smoke a joint and it's usually

498
00:18:02,789 --> 00:18:06,599
one or two buds ground up and mixed

499
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:08,789
together or you smoked a couple of bowls

500
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:10,829
and you will get the desired effect so

501
00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:12,420
unless your plant is massive I don't

502
00:18:10,829 --> 00:18:13,679
think you're going to notice much of a

503
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:16,110
difference I don't think it would be

504
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:17,789
worth the staggered harvest if that is

505
00:18:16,109 --> 00:18:19,619
something you want to do because you

506
00:18:17,789 --> 00:18:21,869
really want those trichomes dialed in

507
00:18:19,619 --> 00:18:23,309
and if it's outdoors and there's nothing

508
00:18:21,869 --> 00:18:25,139
stopping you from leaving the bottom

509
00:18:23,309 --> 00:18:27,509
half for another week go ahead and let

510
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:29,009
it go have fun with it make sure you pay

511
00:18:27,509 --> 00:18:31,170
attention to the temperature because it

512
00:18:29,009 --> 00:18:32,670
is getting really cold outside and I

513
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:34,920
don't want you to leave that second half

514
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:36,720
out there and destroy it and not even

515
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:38,430
get to harvest that and also make sure

516
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,380
that the thieves don't come and get that

517
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:42,000
second half when they see you take the

518
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:43,560
tops down they'll go oh [ __ ] he's gonna

519
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,390
take that plant down soon we got to go

520
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:47,579
get the second half pay attention for

521
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:49,620
that but the main reason we don't do

522
00:18:47,579 --> 00:18:51,689
this in an indoor situation is because

523
00:18:49,619 --> 00:18:54,119
we really just need to chop and clean up

524
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:55,950
and get started again and our plants

525
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:58,229
aren't super massively large and an

526
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:59,549
indoor cultivation facility so the

527
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:01,529
difference between the top and the

528
00:18:59,549 --> 00:19:02,519
bottom is very little I don't think

529
00:19:01,529 --> 00:19:05,279
anybody would notice

530
00:19:02,519 --> 00:19:07,440
and we've also selected cultivars that

531
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:09,389
finish in the timeframe that we need our

532
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,279
growth to run in which is generally nine

533
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:14,070
weeks in a commercial cultivation

534
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:15,690
facility so real rasher I hope I

535
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:17,129
