supports us on patreon

53
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,880
i do have a couple of things to talk

54
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:35,680
about before we get to the email portion

55
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:37,759
of the show

56
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,880
the first question i wanted to answer is

57
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,439
why do i post

58
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:42,078
the premiere on youtube at midnight

59
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:44,078
that's right

60
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:46,078
this podcast comes out on mid at

61
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:46,719
midnight on sunday night into monday

62
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:49,118
morning

63
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:50,158
or at midnight on wednesday night into

64
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:51,680
thursday morning

65
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,960
and there's a good reason for that many

66
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,560
people have said hey i want to hang out

67
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:56,158
and watch the premiere on youtube

68
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,000
but i can't do it because it is simply

69
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,759
too late which i understand we have a

70
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,319
nice group that hangs out on the patreon

71
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,640
or on the

72
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:04,398
youtube premiere uh if you're not aware

73
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,320
when the video does premiere there is a

74
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,639
chat that goes along with the video

75
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:10,478
we hang out we chat live i hang out with

76
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,919
the people in the chat i take some dabs

77
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,440
and answer their questions in the chat

78
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:14,079
it's a nice little crew that hangs out

79
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:16,079
in there

80
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,840
uh many people want to hang out but

81
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,480
unfortunately it is just too late for

82
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,800
them

83
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:22,399
let me explain to you why i post the

84
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,959
video at midnight

85
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,120
this podcast started off as a as an

86
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,120
audio only format there was no video

87
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,200
when this podcast first started

88
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,519
i was putting the show up at midnight on

89
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:35,439
sunday night or into monday morning

90
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,039
so that when people got up for work on

91
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:39,359
monday they had something

92
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:40,639
to brighten their day many people have

93
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,080
to drive to work they don't feel like

94
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:43,439
driving many people have to make some

95
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,480
sort of a commute to work they don't

96
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:46,000
feel like making

97
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:47,840
a lot of people have to go to a job they

98
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,759
don't want to be at many people have a

99
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,000
job they enjoy but listening to the grow

100
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:52,079
from

101
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,080
your heart podcast on a monday morning

102
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,239
will always make your day better

103
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,840
so my goal was to have the podcast

104
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,200
available for everybody

105
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,280
monday morning if you're on the east

106
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:03,359
coast getting up real early it's already

107
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,800
there it came out at midnight so it's up

108
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,920
probably i guess that's two or three

109
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,000
o'clock on the east coast if you're

110
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:08,639
getting up for work at 4 or 4 35 in the

111
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,280
morning

112
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:11,839
the show was there waiting also 12

113
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,519
o'clock

114
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,680
gave me the opportunity to make sure

115
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,879
that the show posted successfully

116
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,400
back in the day there would be some

117
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:19,759
technical issues and i wouldn't get the

118
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,280
show posted properly

119
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:23,679
i'd have to run to my computer do some

120
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,878
adjustments fix some file names or file

121
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,599
numbers or whatever needed to be

122
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:28,399
corrected

123
00:03:25,598 --> 00:03:29,679
in uh the website service then that

124
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,120
would get the show posted

125
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,040
now i'm more confident that the show

126
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,799
will work at midnight but i didn't feel

127
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:35,598
like changing the time for a couple of

128
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,599
reasons

129
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:39,439
i am available at midnight i'm available

130
00:03:37,598 --> 00:03:41,199
to be there in the premiere

131
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:43,359
i also think that midnight was a fair

132
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:45,359
time to release the show so i apologize

133
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,040
if you're on the east coast or somewhere

134
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,879
else and you can't catch the premiere on

135
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:50,878
youtube but that was my intention

136
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:52,878
was to get the show up at midnight so

137
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:54,318
that everybody can watch it the next day

138
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:55,518
it'll be ready for you no matter what

139
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:57,119
time you get up

140
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,039
i've considered changing the time for

141
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,400
the premiere but it doesn't seem fair

142
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:02,239
to the people who have been joining me

143
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,158
since the beginning and also it doesn't

144
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,519
work perfectly for my schedule i don't

145
00:04:04,158 --> 00:04:07,359
know that i can be available

146
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,560
before midnight on a sunday night i know

147
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,879
that sunday night

148
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,318
at midnight i'm available everybody else

149
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:13,039
is in bed everyone else is getting ready

150
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:14,560
for work

151
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:16,238
i've got the house to myself some time

152
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,280
to hang out i know that i can get there

153
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:19,119
for those premieres

154
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,399
so i apologize if you're unable to make

155
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,800
the premiere at midnight

156
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,839
and that is my reasoning behind doing it

157
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,759
at midnight

158
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:27,439
also a lot of people say they missed the

159
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,520
live show at midnight it's not really

160
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:31,360
live it's pre-recorded i'm recording

161
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:33,198
uh it's tuesday afternoon right now when

162
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,720
i'm recording this show will come out

163
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,319
wednesday at midnight thursday

164
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,520
morning-ish

165
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:39,759
a lot of people say they wish they could

166
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:41,198
join the live it is not a live show it

167
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,199
is just a live premiere

168
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,400
the video plays i'm sitting in front of

169
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,919
my computer at home

170
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:47,839
watching on youtube just like you but

171
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:48,879
i'm involved in the chat hopefully just

172
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:51,439
like you

173
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:53,680
that was a really long explanation as to

174
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:54,000
why i post the premieres at midnight but

175
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,600
that

176
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,360
is why there was a reason to it there

177
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,960
was a method to my madness

178
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,560
it started off as an audio show there

179
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:01,359
was never a video there was never a

180
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,038
premiere

181
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,479
the audio came out at midnight so

182
00:05:03,038 --> 00:05:05,599
everybody could listen on their drive to

183
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:07,199
work on monday

184
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,800
uh then it became a video show and i

185
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,079
just never changed the time that's

186
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,800
simply what happened

187
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:14,000
i like being free at midnight i can hang

188
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,960
out in the chat also if there's a

189
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,560
technical issue

190
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:18,319
i can repair it at midnight i've got

191
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,759
time to myself i'm basically alone at

192
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:21,199
midnight most of the time

193
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,280
everybody else is sleeping i've got the

194
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,360
house to myself so midnight was perfect

195
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:26,079
for me i apologize if it doesn't work

196
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,919
for you

197
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:29,279
if that doesn't work for you maybe you

198
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:31,918
can catch me on my

199
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:32,478
monday night instagram live show every

200
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:35,198

00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:40,560
i listen to some music i chat with the

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,720
entire audience there are

205
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,319

into my instagram live video

207

preparation i don't have any warning

211
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,280
it is kind of like stump the breeder

212
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,000
stump the grower or just hang out with

213

221
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:13,758

227
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,319
long time to get over that brief note

228
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:26,079
i've got one more thing i want to talk

229
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,560
about before we get into the emails

230
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:29,758

231
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:31,519

232

channel

241

it's a little more light-hearted it's a

242
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,759

shout out to my buddy crazyhand alright

where are we going from there

258
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:23,519
let's talk about the silver thio sulfate

259
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:24,879
update in a previous episode i talked

260
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:28,000
about making our own

261
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:29,519
feminized seed reversal spray i listened

262
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,199
back to it during the premiere

263
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:33,359
and i realized i may have skipped a

264
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,960
couple of minor details

265
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,960
everything i told you will work you'll

266
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:38,879
be successful with the advice and the

267
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:39,758
plan i gave you but here are a few more

268
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:42,079
things that may

269
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,479
set you up for better success with your

270
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:47,279
silver thiosulfate

271
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:48,079
um get the powdered silver thiosulfate

272
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:50,559
mix the

273
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:52,240
uh the sodium nitrate and the uh

274
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,360
thiosulfate which ones

275
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,598
are what are they called here the silver

276
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,280
nitrate and the sodium thiosulfate

277
00:07:55,598 --> 00:07:58,560
get the powdered versions a couple of

278
00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:00,559
people said they found the liquid

279
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,240
version on amazon or somewhere else

280
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,000
get the powdered version i don't like

281
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,560
the chunks i don't like the big parts

282
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,680
i like the fine powder so get those

283
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,839
powders

284
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,800
those powders should be white when you

285
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:13,038
open them up

286
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,639
if they are a dark color they are

287
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:16,399
starting to degrade i would not

288
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,319
recommend using the darker colored

289
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:20,399
powders if they've turned dark on you

290
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,720
if they've gotten brown or gray do not

291
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:24,478
use those they should be pure white

292
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,199
in my experience they've always been

293
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:30,560
pure white i find lower quality

294
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,598
less results when i use darker colored

295
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,399
materials

296
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:35,598
also if the water turns dark when you

297
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,200
mix the solution

298
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,120
something has gone wrong you've got some

299
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,120
contaminants and particulates in there

300
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,200
the water should stay clear when you

301
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,399
start mixing everything up it'll go dark

302
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,680
when you put the [ __ ] in right away

303
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,039
because you just added stuff to it but

304
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:50,319
once it all dissolves

305
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:53,360
it should be clear i highly recommend

306
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,959
that you use glass containers anytime

307
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,080
you're pouring the water into anything

308
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:58,239
doing any mixing

309
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,920
use a glass container and i said in the

310
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,600
episode that i use a butter knife

311
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:03,039
for stirring the butter knife is metal

312
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,480
nothing's going to stick to it

313
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:05,838
i'm not going to add anything i'm not

314
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,120
going to take anything out of my mix

315
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,600
it's non-porous

316
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,320
it doesn't have other [ __ ] on it so use

317
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,040
clean

318
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,519
glass containers clean them thoroughly

319
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:17,599
use clean glass containers and use

320
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,120
something metal or sterile for stirring

321
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,680
i use the butter knife simply because i

322
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,120
have it

323
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:22,879
it's sitting around it's right in the

324
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,120
kitchen i can clean it very well

325
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:27,600
nothing sticks to it it's non-porous use

326
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:31,120
glass and metal if possible

327
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,560
then i highly recommend using distilled

328
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,720
water i don't know if i went over that

329
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:35,759
in the last episode i highly recommend

330
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,519
distilled water

331
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:39,360
we're trying to mix up a solution here

332
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,879
so we can add certain things to our

333
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,440
plants we don't need other

334
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:45,278
elements other chemicals other variables

335
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,480
in our mix we're trying to make silver

336
00:09:45,278 --> 00:09:49,919
thiosulfate

337
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,440
not silver thiosulfate plus whatever was

338
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:52,799
in the water you started with or

339
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,600
whatever was stuck to your previous

340
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:56,240
container

341
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:58,000
do everything super clean all right so

342
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,919
the best way to store your silver

343
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,559
thiosulfate here's something i did not

344
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:03,039
cover

345
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:03,759
it stores separately it stores better

346
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:06,480
separately

347
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:08,480
i said to mix the one powder into 500 ml

348
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,839
of water and another powder into 500

349
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,519
milliliters of water

350
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,839
if you're not going to use all of the

351
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:16,078
solution you're making it is

352
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,680
easily stored by not mixing those two

353
00:10:16,078 --> 00:10:19,599
together it will last longer if you

354
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:21,199
don't mix parts a and b

355
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,200
if you have mixed parts a and b they

356
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,920
will still store just fine but you get a

357
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,160
longer

358
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:27,039
shelf life in my opinion if you do not

359
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:29,679
mix them

360
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:30,879
so keep parts a and part b separately

361
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:32,879
mix them when needed

362
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:34,958
then dilute and use as needed if you've

363
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:37,120
already mixed them that is just fine

364
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:39,039
that will store just as well but not for

365
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,240
as long in my opinion over time it will

366
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:41,759
begin to degrade

367
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,600
it won't be as potent it won't work as

368
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:46,720
well on your plants for reversal

369
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:49,360
so it stores better non-mixed

370
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,720
don't mix the two containers together or

371
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,519
if you can just keep the concentrates

372
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,600
stored together

373
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,879
that works well also every time you

374
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,959
start adding more together

375
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:58,559
it seems to degrade more quickly so if

376
00:10:56,958 --> 00:11:00,319
you can keep the two jars separate

377
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:02,239
that's your best bet you can mix them

378
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,680
and have one jar that's a good bet

379
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,600
once you've gone to diluting it for

380
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:07,439
spray that is when you start degrading

381
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:11,120
the product more rapidly

382
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:13,519
store it in a cool dry dark place

383
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,278
i put mine and it's in the glass jars i

384
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,759
put those glass jars in a brown paper

385
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:17,519
bag

386
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:19,039
i label them so everybody knows what it

387
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,078
is and i stick that in the back of the

388
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:22,240
refrigerator

389
00:11:20,078 --> 00:11:23,599
it's cold it's dark it's dry they're

390
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,240
sealed up nothing's going to get in

391
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,360
there

392
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,159
make sure nobody drinks your silver

393
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,079
thiosulfate

394
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:31,519
solution if you live with other people

395
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:33,599
especially children

396
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:35,039
do everything you need to do to protect

397
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,800
your household from

398
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:38,319
contaminating themselves by drinking

399
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:39,679
silver thiosulfate

400
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,360
i don't know what will happen to a

401
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:42,479
person if they drink that i don't want

402
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,560
to find out

403
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,320
i know that silver is not good for you

404
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:47,278
in large doses some people say to use

405
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,440
colloidal silver

406
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:51,278
i'm way off track here anyway make sure

407
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,720
you protect yourself and your family so

408
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:55,759
nobody consumes

409
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,399
your silver thiosulfate a mix or b mix

410
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:59,919
or

411
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:02,720
the combined solution light does degrade

412
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:04,240
the quality of your silver thiosulfate

413
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,759
solution if you've got it diluted

414
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,440
non-diluted mixed

415
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:09,200
however you've got it keep it dark

416
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,519
because the light will

417
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,360
cause the product to degrade it will not

418
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:16,078
be as good of a product

419
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,200
also wear gloves and long sleeves when

420
00:12:16,078 --> 00:12:19,439
you're spraying this

421
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,560
also maybe put down some newspaper

422
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,160
underneath the plant when you're going

423
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:24,879
to spray if you've got a strong

424
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:26,639
non-diluted mix sometimes it will turn

425
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:27,278
uh white walls will turn a little bit

426
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,440
purple

427
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:31,039
your skin will get some weird dots on it

428
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,480
you can contaminate things with the

429
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:34,319
silver thiosulfate

430
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:37,120
so that is my update i wanted to come in

431
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,519
and say dark colored materials are bad

432
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,240
dark water is bad always use glass

433
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,320
containers

434
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,240
always use something non-porous and

435
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,160
clean for stirring

436
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,759
i recommend highly recommend using

437
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:49,439
distilled water

438
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:51,039
store them separately if possible if

439
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,639
you've already mixed it that's okay

440
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:54,480
it will still store the stuff is so

441
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,879
cheap that you can just make a bunch

442
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,159
more

443
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:57,919
don't even worry about it it's really

444
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:59,039
affordable get the products use the

445
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:01,360
distilled water

446
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:02,719
store it uh non-dilute if you can if

447
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,200
you've already mixed it together that's

448
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,639
fine

449
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,560
keep it in the fridge keep it nice and

450
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,799
cool and always do your best

451
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:10,719
to keep it dark and most importantly

452
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:11,519
label the [ __ ] out of it little kids

453
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,040
can't read

454
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,720
so even if you do write silver

455
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:16,000
thiosulfate don't drink this

456
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,839
the little kids may still get in the

457
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,078
fridge one day they may drink it

458
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,680
do everything you can to prevent that

459
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:23,759
that is your responsibility be a

460
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:25,919

injure make anybody sick while we're

464
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,639
attempting to grow good cannabis

465
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:33,360
medicine all right that is my update on

466
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,839
that part

467
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,800
now it is time to jump into the email

468
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,680
portion of

469
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:40,399
today's episode the first email on my

470
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:43,679
screen

471
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:46,240
comes from greenvet 88224.

472
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:47,278
shout out to greenvet88224 this one came

473
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,919
from patreon

474
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:51,439
and the question goes just like this it

475
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:53,519
says i thought of a question

476
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,360
i've read online that softened water is

477
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:57,278
unhealthy for our plants

478
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,800
cannabis plants included yes that is

479
00:13:57,278 --> 00:14:00,559
absolutely true

480
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:02,159
it says is this true even when using

481
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:04,719
liquid nutrients

482
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:05,439
yes sir that is true it says i use ro

483
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,600
water

484
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,720
i buy the water but the water at my grow

485
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,240
site is softened

486
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:14,399
with a ppm reading of 185 is the issue

487
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,720
that the water is softened with salt

488
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:17,919
thanks i love the podcast from and they

489
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,120
signed it with their real name i don't

490
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:19,759
know if they want their real name right

491
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,360
on the air

492
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:22,958

um they're asking about uh water

503
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,480
softener a lot of people get water from

504
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:41,919
a well

505
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,000
or they've got to use a water softener

506
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:46,559
it says i use ro water but the water

507
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,159
at my grow site is softened with a ppm

508
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:51,439
of 185

509
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:53,360
um water softeners are water

510
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,959
is softened by softened i said that

511
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:58,000
really oddly but you're getting it

512
00:14:54,958 --> 00:15:01,679
water is softened by using salts they

513
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,919
actually use sodium and potassium

514
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:04,879
to soften the water and at the same time

515
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:07,599
it removes

516
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:09,519
the calcium and the magnesium so that is

517
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,839
not good for our plants because

518
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:12,639
that sodium is basically like drinking

519
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:14,320
salt water

520
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,919
so it makes our plants think that they

521
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,519
are in a drought they're getting water

522
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:18,958
but they're not getting hydrated

523
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,399
they keep drinking that water they're

524
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:21,439
not hydrating themselves they're saying

525
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,198
hey i'm thirsty

526
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,800
i should be getting hydrated but they're

527
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:27,198
just sucking down salt water

528
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:28,958
and getting saltier and saltier and over

529
00:15:27,198 --> 00:15:31,039
time that will dehydrate

530
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:33,198
and destroy our plants the sodium will

531
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:35,439
dry out the plants

532
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:37,278
it's a lot like being in the ocean and

533
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,680
dying of thirst there's no fresh water

534
00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:39,360
there

535
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:41,278
you've got to clean up that water all

536
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,039
that salt water is not good for you your

537
00:15:41,278 --> 00:15:44,720
body can't process it it's not hydrating

538
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:45,439
you in any way it's just salting you up

539
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,480
so

540
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,519
um yes uh the softened water is

541
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,320
unhealthy

542
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:54,799
for your plants it says that you've got

543
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,560
ro water i would stick with the ro water

544
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:58,078
is what i would do it's a little bit

545
00:15:56,559 --> 00:15:59,758
more challenging it needs to be buffered

546
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:02,239
it's harder to keep the ph

547
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,759
but it is not salty as [ __ ] and it's not

548
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,480
going to kill your plants so

549
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:08,879
the question is is this true even when

550
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,879
using liquid nutrients absolutely

551
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:12,559
this is true even when using liquid

552
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:13,120
nutrients be careful with that softened

553
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:14,879
water

554
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,399
because i don't want you to dehydrate

555
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:18,720
your plants make them all

556
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:19,440
salty we're trying to grow fine grade

557
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,839
cannabis

558
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,199
not salty hemp trees all right thank you

559
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:24,639
for the great question

560
00:16:23,198 --> 00:16:26,719
i'm gonna keep moving forward because i

561
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:29,519
feel like i've got a good flow

562
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:31,278
this one came from our friend what's the

563
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:32,799
name they want me to call them i'm just

564
00:16:31,278 --> 00:16:33,838
gonna call you xavier what's up bro i

565
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:36,879
hope you're doing well

566
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:38,560
the message says my man rosta jeff happy

567
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:39,439
new year bro happy new year to you as

568
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:41,278
well

569
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,279
it goes on to say i hope the start of

570
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:45,439
your year is going excellent

571
00:16:43,278 --> 00:16:47,360
my year has been great i'm really

572
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,279
excited to move on from 2020 and see

573
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,720
what we can do with 2021 we've got a

574
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:53,439
bunch of fresh new starts

575
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,278
and honestly i am excited about it all

576
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,240
right it says unfortunately i'm starting

577
00:16:55,278 --> 00:16:59,439
my new year

578
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,879
with sick plants that's okay uh it says

579
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,480
i'm embarrassed to admit it

580
00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:04,318
uh don't ever be embarrassed to admit

581
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,919
that you've got sick plants things go

582
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:07,599
wrong in nature things happen

583
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:09,679
especially in the garden especially when

584
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:10,078
you're learning admitting it is a huge

585
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:11,839
step

586
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:13,359
so you've admitted you got a problem now

587
00:17:11,838 --> 00:17:15,359
we can work on solving it

588
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:16,558
it says my once beautiful morning dew

589
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,159
plants in seedlings

590
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:20,558
have started showing the ugliest

591
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:23,199
downward clawing and they are so

592
00:17:20,558 --> 00:17:24,558
droopy so they are downward clawing and

593
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,400
they're super droopy

594
00:17:24,558 --> 00:17:28,318
i can think of a lot of things that will

595
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,320
cause that we will narrow it down it

596
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:32,798
says even the veins of the leaves

597
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:34,079
look very pronounced and swollen all

598
00:17:32,798 --> 00:17:35,279
right that's given me a couple more

599
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:37,199
ideas

600
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:38,960
i feel like i've over watered in this

601
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,720
case i'm not sure

602
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,319
i'm going to say you've over watered if

603
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,839
it is clawing it's a little bit too

604
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:45,839
watered if it's droopy and it's been

605
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:48,319
watered it's probably over watered

606
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:50,480
that thick vein you see is a little bit

607
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:52,159
of osmotic pressure possibly

608
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,679
there's just too much moisture that leaf

609
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,279
is trying to move that water around has

610
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:56,640
nowhere to go it can't let the air i

611
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:57,918
can't let the water out through the leaf

612
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,720
that quickly

613
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:02,320
the plants are struggling it said i feed

614
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,319
once a week every friday

615
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:06,159
i don't feed as much because it seems

616
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:07,038
like this peat based soil i use takes

617
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,240
forever to

618
00:18:07,038 --> 00:18:13,038
dry um well you just got to adjust

619
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,558
to the drying time of that plant as it

620
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:15,679
gets bigger your plants are small now

621
00:18:14,558 --> 00:18:17,678
i've seen the pictures

622
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,200
as they get bigger that dry time will

623
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,320
decrease they'll dry out more quickly

624
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,519
because the plants will be eating more

625
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:23,200
the roots will be larger

626
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:24,639
there'll be more processing happening in

627
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,558
your rhizosphere

628
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,559
so your watering time will increase but

629
00:18:26,558 --> 00:18:29,678
now i am certain of it that you're over

630
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:31,279
watering

631
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:32,798
and watering too frequently you've got

632
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:34,079
to let them dry out a little bit more

633
00:18:32,798 --> 00:18:35,918
than what you've been doing

634
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:37,839
before you water the next time don't be

635
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:39,520
so eager uh don't think they've got to

636
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:40,720
be thirsty they got to be hungry

637
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:42,079
because they'll let you know when

638
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,519
they're hungry and thirsty they're

639
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:45,678
letting you know that you've been over

640
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:46,558
watering them by giving you the claw the

641
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:48,640
thick vein

642
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:50,558
and the droopiness uh it says my plants

643
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,200
are all between five and nine inches

644
00:18:50,558 --> 00:18:53,119
tall

645
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,640
my two plants are in two of my plants

646
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:55,279
are in one gallon pots and the others

647
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,000
are in six

648
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:59,119
gallon or six solo cups so yeah i'm

649
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,319
going to assume that you're over

650
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:01,599
watering these small plants because

651
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:03,359
they're brand new and you're eager to

652
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:04,558
get nutrients to them you just want to

653
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:05,918
feed them and get them bigger

654
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:09,440
i'm going to assume that you're over

655
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:11,919
watering it also says i grow under led

656
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,840
purple lighting my last feed was at 600

657
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:14,640
ppms i used advanced nutrients and

658
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:15,839
recharge

659
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,240
that all sounds like it's going to work

660
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:20,000
my humidity is between 50 and 60 percent

661
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,240
uh that's good for now it may need to go

662
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,798
down soon it says my daytime temp is

663
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:28,079
about 78 to 81 that's gonna work for you

664
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:29,918
my nighttime temp is 68 to 73.

665
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:31,599
uh that's not too bad as long as you're

666
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,600
not getting too much of a swing

667
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:35,439
in your nighttime to daytime temperature

668
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:38,558
i said how do i get my plants

669
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,840
back to normal okay i looked at some

670
00:19:38,558 --> 00:19:40,960
pictures here there were pictures

671
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:43,359
included in this

672
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,880
the pots you are using are simply too

673
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:45,678
large you've got small plants you've

674
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,840
said that

675
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,720
some are in solo cups the plants that

676
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:51,279
are in

677
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,000
the one gallon pots those should still

678
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:53,440
be in solo

679
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,200
cups those plants weren't ready to be

680
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,400
transplanted you've got a little tiny

681
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,160
root zone and a big

682
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,519
container and you're just watering that

683
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,880
whole container and that little root

684
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:02,000
zone is saying that's a lot of water i

685
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,840
didn't need all that

686
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,759
so your first thing is that the pots are

687
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:06,000
too big the second thing is that they

688
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:08,000
are

689
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,200
too wet when i looked at your photos i

690
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,880
didn't see anything in there for

691
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,240
drainage i don't see enough perlite i

692
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,720
don't see any persolite

693
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,240
uh but i do see some weird rocks on the

694
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,880
top of the plants i asked about the

695
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,880
rocks

696
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,400
uh you said you were using those to

697
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,000
support the plant i would get rid of

698
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,200
those rocks immediately

699
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,200
i don't know what you're when you're

700
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,720
watering those rocks have minerals

701
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,080
they're dirty they got salts on them

702
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,440
you're watering something from those

703
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:31,038
rocks into your plant

704
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,798
that's highly unnecessary i would pull

705
00:20:31,038 --> 00:20:34,158
the rocks out and i would put a stick in

706
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:35,119
there to support that plant that will

707
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:36,720
help you out

708
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:38,798
also i can tell by looking at the

709
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,400
pictures and i will include a photo here

710
00:20:38,798 --> 00:20:42,079
uh for the audience that is watching

711
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,440
visually i'll drop in a photo right

712
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:44,639
about now so you guys can see what i'm

713
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,960
talking about

714
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,400
but uh those plants have been overfed

715
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,159
they are too small for the amount of

716
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,640
nutrients you're trying to give them

717
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:54,400
so they need some time to dry and they

718
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,038
don't need as much food i would let them

719
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,798
dry

720
00:20:55,038 --> 00:20:58,640
give them more time between feedings

721
00:20:56,798 --> 00:21:00,720
more dry time between feedings

722
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,320
i would reduce the amount of nitrogen

723
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,720
and i would definitely remove

724
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:06,639
those rocks from the grow those are a

725
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:09,038
few things that should get your plants

726
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,640
back on track and i was fortunate enough

727
00:21:09,038 --> 00:21:11,359
to be back in contact with our friend

728

00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:12,000
lights you're using and then i ask a few

763
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:15,120
details of your grow

764
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,359
then i let you ask me a grow question

765
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:18,158
here is the grow help tab they came from

766
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:20,399
our friend

767
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:21,440
do they want their name used yes this is

768
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,038
from robert

769
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,640
and it says they're growing wedding cake

770
00:22:23,038 --> 00:22:26,558
they're growing it indoors they're

771
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,720
growing under an hps light they're in

772
00:22:26,558 --> 00:22:31,119
flower they're in week seven

773
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,839
they're growing in cocoa the last feed

774
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:33,759
was water

775
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:36,639
enzymes and shine sounds like a great

776
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:37,759
feed the ph was 6.0 i would raise that

777
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,880
up just a little bit

778
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:41,839
the ppm or ec was 300 the daytime temp

779
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,360
is 76

780
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:47,599
night time temp is 64. i would

781
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:48,399
uh warm it up just a little bit it says

782
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:51,439
nighttime

783
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:53,120
relative humidity is 55 on our daytime

784
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,159
relative humidity is 55 nighttime

785
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:56,639
humidity 55

786
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:58,720
it says the problem is my air

787
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,400
conditioner took a crap

788
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,679
oh that is always a bummer when the air

789
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,960
conditioner takes a crap you got to

790
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,720
scramble and get a new one

791
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,079
it says i cannot get it fixed for a few

792
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,720
days due to the holiday

793
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:09,359
and coved seasons i understand that

794
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,720
completely

795
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:15,119
it says my question is is 75 to 77

796
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:17,200
degrees daytime temps and 65 degree

797
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:19,678
nighttime temps and humidity

798
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,600
and humidity around 55 gonna hurt the

799
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:23,679
grow if those conditions stay for five

800
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:27,038
to seven days then back to normal

801
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:29,038
which would be around 73 at night and 65

802
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:32,079
or 73 during the day

803
00:23:29,038 --> 00:23:33,038
and 65 at night with 40 relative

804
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:34,879
humidity

805
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:36,240
um i don't think your plants are going

806
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,640
to see any problem

807
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,720
with 75 to 77 degrees i think they're

808
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:43,278
going to enjoy that

809
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:45,200
i think you could run that temperature

810
00:23:43,278 --> 00:23:48,000
all the time and they would be just fine

811
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,880
i like 77 degrees in the grow room 77 is

812
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,319
really nice

813
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,480
the plants are comfortable i am

814
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:53,839
comfortable uh however in a commercial

815
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,000
environment i've seen that they get up

816
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:58,158
to about 81 and they seem to perform

817
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,599
a little more quickly sometimes so i

818
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:02,799
don't think you're going to see

819
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:04,158
any problems with the temperature excuse

820
00:24:02,798 --> 00:24:06,400
me for the throat clearing

821
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:07,600
i do think that maybe your humidity may

822
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,320
be a little bit high

823
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:11,519
so while you are down with your air

824
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:12,798
conditioner and you're getting the

825
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:15,679
higher humidity

826
00:24:12,798 --> 00:24:16,879
maybe consider adding another fan or two

827
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:19,200
maybe consider

828
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,080
watering just a little bit less or less

829
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,240
frequently

830
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:23,278
just to keep that uh humidity down a

831
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,319
little bit if you don't put as much

832
00:24:23,278 --> 00:24:26,319
water in the room

833
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:27,759
that much water cannot get into the air

834
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:29,439
so that is something i would consider

835
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:30,319
maybe water just a little bit less but

836
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,120
overall

837
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:33,759
i see zero problems rising from this

838
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:36,000
couple of

839
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:37,679
degrees difference i actually think that

840
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,159
they may benefit from it pay attention

841
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,440
to them

842
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:41,520
and see if you like this lower

843
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,278
temperature compared to your usual

844
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:45,119
higher temperature this may be something

845
00:24:43,278 --> 00:24:45,599
you adjust to and you can save a few

846
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:47,038
bucks

847
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:48,480
or they may like the higher temperature

848
00:24:47,038 --> 00:24:50,000
not the lower temperature i apologize

849
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,919
that's rarely the case

850
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,200
um they may want to be a little bit

851
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:53,840
warmer like you're getting them so pay

852
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,919
attention

853
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:57,678
and see how they react to the higher

854
00:24:55,919 --> 00:25:00,240
temps it'll only be a couple of days

855
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:01,840
maybe a week or so but you may notice

856
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,519
they grow a little bit more quickly

857
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:05,278
you get more vigor out of them with that

858
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:06,720
warmer temperature although you are

859
00:25:05,278 --> 00:25:07,839
fighting that higher humidity

860
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,079
i'm not sure how they're going to do

861
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:11,839
with that but it won't be too long

862
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:13,599
you're not going to get bud mold or

863
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:15,038
anything like that that at that point in

864
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:17,199
flower with that much humidity

865
00:25:15,038 --> 00:25:18,798
any higher humidity i would be concerned

866
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,200
but pay attention don't let it get too

867
00:25:18,798 --> 00:25:20,480
high

868
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,480
all right i feel like i've answered that

869
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,000
question more than thoroughly let's send

870
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,360
a big thank you shout out to our friend

871
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,960
robert for the great message

872
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:28,479
if you've got any more questions i would

873
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,640
love to hear from you

874
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,720
all right let's move into the last

875
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,559
message on today's episode this one

876
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,798
actually came from youtube

877
00:25:34,558 --> 00:25:37,678
and it came from our friend fresh baked

878
00:25:36,798 --> 00:25:40,158
and it says

879
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:41,840
hey ross to jeff i thought let's see i

880
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:43,039
thought age had to do a little bit with

881
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:45,038
pre-flowers

882
00:25:43,038 --> 00:25:46,480
from my experience topping early has

883
00:25:45,038 --> 00:25:48,798
seemed to make them flower

884
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,679
later have you seen this as well i

885
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:51,679
haven't thought about

886
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:54,159
root bound being the trigger and it

887
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:56,240
makes sense i usually hesitate to up pot

888
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:56,720
from one gallons until i see them all

889
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,519
right

890
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,880
so the question here is about pre-flower

891
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:02,639
our friend is saying that

892
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,799
they topped their plants and they are

893
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,960
wondering if topping the plants

894
00:26:04,798 --> 00:26:08,480
will create pre-flower will cause

895
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,558
pre-flower to appear

896
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,599
later in the cycle i've got a good

897
00:26:10,558 --> 00:26:14,000
answer for this

898
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:14,719
the short answer is yes topping your

899
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,440
plants

900
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,798
can encourage your plants to pre-flower

901
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:22,400
a little bit later

902
00:26:18,798 --> 00:26:24,720
and let me explain why cannabis plants

903
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,000
are apical dominant meaning they want

904
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,319
one top

905
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,119
bud they want one piece to grow up to

906
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:31,759
the top

907
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:33,918
that one bud its goal is to reach up to

908
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:35,839
the top and get pollinated usually male

909
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:37,759
plants grow taller than the females

910
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:39,199
the boys will be up above the girls the

911
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:40,640
male plant will be just a few inches

912
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,159
maybe a foot higher depending on your

913
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:45,200
environment and genetics

914
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:47,278
when pollen starts to fall it goes down

915
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,278
so that female plant that's right below

916
00:26:47,278 --> 00:26:50,240
it right next to it that top apical

917
00:26:49,278 --> 00:26:51,919
dominant bud

918
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,919
is going to get pollinated so it's got

919
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:55,919
one bud always competing to be up at the

920
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:58,240
top it wants to make that one

921
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:00,080
big giant it's a big sex organ it's

922
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,759
looking to get that one big sex organ

923
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:03,918
pollinated it's like here i am

924
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:05,359
coat me and pollen so i can make seeds

925
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:07,038
and i can continue my

926
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:08,879
future i can continue for more

927
00:27:07,038 --> 00:27:10,960
generations so

928
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,559
that plant wants to naturally make an

929
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:15,200
apical dominant top

930
00:27:12,558 --> 00:27:17,200
when you cut out that top what happens

931
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,080
the hormones that are in that top are no

932
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,240
longer there

933
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:22,158
and the plant goes hey i'm not ready for

934
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,440
puberty you just took off my parts that

935
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:25,278
were growing that were older

936
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,120
they were ready to go into puberty i'm

937
00:27:25,278 --> 00:27:29,200
gonna be a little teenager again

938
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:31,359
and i don't have any of my pre-flower my

939
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,919
maturity my puberty parts

940
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:34,959
so you just remove the apical dominant

941
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:36,480
top from that plant

942
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,399
you took out a lot of auxins and

943
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,679
cytokinins the hormones have been moved

944
00:27:38,398 --> 00:27:41,038
around in that plant

945
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:43,120
all of those branches that are down

946
00:27:41,038 --> 00:27:45,038
lower that are left they go hey

947
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:46,558
the president is gone there's a chance

948
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:47,839
for me to be the president now

949
00:27:46,558 --> 00:27:49,359
and they all start trying to work their

950
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:50,558
way up to the top they want to be the

951
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:52,319
new king they want to be the new

952
00:27:50,558 --> 00:27:54,158
president they want to be the new leader

953
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:55,439
they don't know that there are seven

954
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:56,880
eight other branches

955
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,159
nine other branches trying to get up

956
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,399
there to the top to be the leader as

957
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:01,919
well so they all start taking off

958
00:28:00,398 --> 00:28:04,079
those new branches don't have the

959
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:05,520
hormones that that old branch had you

960
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:06,240
cut those developed those built up

961
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:08,079
hormones

962
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,839
right out of the plant now the plant

963
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:11,759
thinks it's a youngster again

964
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:13,038
and it's going i'm not ready for puberty

965
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:15,038
it's going to grow a little bit longer

966
00:28:13,038 --> 00:28:16,879
until it can move those hormones around

967
00:28:15,038 --> 00:28:18,240
once the oxens have developed and moved

968
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,840
around again it'll say

969
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,359
oh now it might be time to start

970
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:23,519
spitting out some pre-flowers

971
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:25,119
now is the time to flower also you did

972
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:26,558
mention that being root bound

973
00:28:25,119 --> 00:28:28,239
will help with that yes if you don't

974
00:28:26,558 --> 00:28:29,200
transplant them soon enough they will

975
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,038
still show

976
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,798
their pre-flower but if you have them in

977
00:28:31,038 --> 00:28:34,158
ideal conditions with a big enough pot

978
00:28:32,798 --> 00:28:36,319
they're not getting root bound

979
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:37,679
you top them they won't show pre-flower

980
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:39,918
as early because

981
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:41,440
you have removed those hormones from

982
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:43,360
that apical dominant top

983
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:45,200
and now all your lowers are competing to

984
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:47,119
be the new top and those hormones

985
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,798
simply are not there they're in

986
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:50,319
competition they're young

987
00:28:48,798 --> 00:28:52,558
they're [ __ ] rampant they're trying

988
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:54,319
to get up there and be the new lion king

989
00:28:52,558 --> 00:28:56,079
the new president the new head of the

990
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:58,798
table the new top blood

991
00:28:56,079 --> 00:29:00,000
so that is exactly why in my opinion

992
00:28:58,798 --> 00:29:02,798
from my experience

993
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,759
uh you don't see pre-flower as early

994
00:29:02,798 --> 00:29:05,839
when you top

995
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:07,278
your plants all right that was a great

996
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:08,480
question thank you for that one

997
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:09,919
if you've got any more questions

998
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,880
corrections comments or concerns i'd

999
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:12,799
love to hear from you

1000
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,559
