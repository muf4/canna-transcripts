56
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:57,700
smoking onto the start of the show Mike

57
00:01:56,709 --> 00:01:59,589
and I were already talking about how

58
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:02,920
dabbed out we are we started off by

59
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:05,439
taking dad's of some Clementine HC FS e

60
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:07,930
big ol chunky diamonds with a lot of

61
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:10,149
Terps on it just delicious then we

62
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:12,189
switched to some Holy Grail Kush which

63
00:02:10,149 --> 00:02:13,778
was even more delicious in my opinion

64
00:02:12,188 --> 00:02:14,318
it's cuz I don't smoke a lot of that I

65
00:02:13,778 --> 00:02:16,030
was kind of

66
00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:18,729
oiled with it it was really nice that's

67
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:21,519
a really nice flavor then Mike threw

68
00:02:18,729 --> 00:02:23,679
down some Lucinda Williams HC FSE

69
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:26,019
crystals I dunk that into some

70
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,968
Clementine Terps that was really nice

71
00:02:26,019 --> 00:02:30,010
that was really nice then after the

72
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:32,108
break we smoked more of the Holy Grail

73
00:02:30,009 --> 00:02:33,848
Kush after Mike's little cigarette break

74
00:02:32,109 --> 00:02:37,030
he's probably a good choice before we

75
00:02:33,848 --> 00:02:40,479
got got into record and we were I don't

76
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:42,400
know there was a slowdown that needed to

77
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:44,078
occur yeah yeah we might have been too

78
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,658

starting with Oklahoma Oklahoma so a

85
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:05,370
couple episodes ago we talked about

86
00:03:02,378 --> 00:03:07,568
Oklahoma legalizing medical marijuana

87
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:09,280
yes we did shout out to all of our

88
00:03:07,568 --> 00:03:10,418
friends in Oklahoma we got quite a few

89
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,979
friends out there they listen to the

90
00:03:10,419 --> 00:03:14,049
podcasts that support us big shout out

91
00:03:11,979 --> 00:03:15,638
you know who you guys are one of my

92
00:03:14,049 --> 00:03:18,729
friends sent us a message he's like hey

93
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:20,199
dude Oklahoma just legalized and then as

94
00:03:18,729 --> 00:03:22,930
soon as they announced the rules we

95
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:24,129
realized that it totally sucks so we did

96
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:26,079
some investigating I did some

97
00:03:24,128 --> 00:03:29,649
investigating there's one thing I

98
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:32,259
noticed there is no list of qualifying

99
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:34,389
conditions it's just up to your doc to

100
00:03:32,258 --> 00:03:36,839
decide if you should get medical

101
00:03:34,389 --> 00:03:39,699
marijuana or not as it was originally

102
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:42,908
yeah Oklahoma you guys have some really

103
00:03:39,699 --> 00:03:45,790
interesting rules the no list of

104
00:03:42,908 --> 00:03:46,959
requirements is just the one what you've

105
00:03:45,789 --> 00:03:49,239
got a list of some others you've got

106
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,829
good notes on this I just scanned

107
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:52,780
yes article this morning so they

108
00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:54,969
mentioned the first thing that I noticed

109
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:56,500
was no list of qualifying conditions so

110
00:03:54,969 --> 00:03:59,139
I guess we found a negative and a

111
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:00,789
positive to that the doc can assign your

112
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:02,799
medical marijuana recommendation if

113
00:04:00,789 --> 00:04:04,539
you've got a hangnail and he thinks that

114
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,650
your medical marijuana may help with

115
00:04:04,539 --> 00:04:10,209
that so that's kind of cool

116
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:12,129
it does open it up that's gonna be up to

117
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:13,449
the doc or the docs gonna be liberal

118
00:04:12,128 --> 00:04:16,358
with that are they gonna be kind of

119
00:04:13,449 --> 00:04:19,090
tight with that I think it's that's

120
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:22,079
gonna depend wildly on implementation in

121
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:22,078
practice if

122
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:26,290
just basing what other states have gone

123
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:31,600
through like I want to say it was

124
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:34,319
Michigan that when the news got footage

125
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:37,180
of five hundred people in a hotel lobby

126
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:38,740
waiting in line to see the only two

127
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:43,180
doctors in the state that were signing

128
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:44,829
cards the story was about how to doctors

129
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:48,310
signed up five hundred people in a

130
00:04:44,829 --> 00:04:50,169
weekend not how only two doctors in the

131
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:52,660
state are willing to do this and so

132
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:55,600
people have to jump like the way the

133
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:57,550
story was presented led to a backlash

134
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,870
that completely imploded their system

135
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:05,290
and they've had to restart like three

136
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:07,240
times now and with no patient list at

137
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:10,480
this point in time it's not gonna be

138
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:12,280
like California where there's people set

139
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:14,140
up everywhere where you can walk in get

140
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:16,989
your card walk across the street and

141
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:19,569
shop medically and that systems been in

142
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:22,629
place for twenty years now it's

143
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:25,389
currently being rebuilt from the ground

144
00:05:22,629 --> 00:05:26,680
up under legalization which apparently

145
00:05:25,389 --> 00:05:31,569
they weren't quite ready for but

146
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:35,230
California you'll get there but if the

147
00:05:31,569 --> 00:05:37,779
doctors like is a group started getting

148
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:39,280
backlash because people are like certain

149
00:05:37,779 --> 00:05:42,159
members of their community are over

150
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:43,659
prescribing for stuff that the rest of

151
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,100
the community doesn't see is worthy

152
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:46,300
there might be some push and pull on

153
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:48,220
different substances

154
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:52,600
different recommendations for different

155
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:55,420
ailments the way I was just thinking of

156
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:59,020
it though is in Colorado we've never

157
00:05:55,420 --> 00:06:01,540
been able to expand our list there's a

158
00:05:59,019 --> 00:06:03,519
list of conditions several other

159
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:05,230
conditions have been presented and

160
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:07,779
pushed through the process and at the

161
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:09,280
last step they get denied and they all

162
00:06:07,779 --> 00:06:11,289
get denied for the same reason and it's

163
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:13,329
because there's not a big FDA backed

164
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:14,680
double-blind studies showing that

165
00:06:13,329 --> 00:06:18,039
cannabis is an effective treatment

166
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:20,019
option for Blanke there's a lot of

167
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:23,560
anecdotal evidence but until that last

168
00:06:20,019 --> 00:06:26,250
big study happens [ __ ] off and now

169
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:29,170
Oklahoma won't have to deal with that if

170
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:30,610
evidence starts to point to some some

171
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:33,759
treatment option that we're not

172
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:35,530
currently utilized in cannabis for they

173
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,889
can just start recommending right off

174
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:37,388
the bat

175
00:06:35,889 --> 00:06:39,129
for that they don't have to tell that

176
00:06:37,389 --> 00:06:43,509
whole population pretend you've got

177
00:06:39,129 --> 00:06:44,770
cancer right rule yes we can get you in

178
00:06:43,509 --> 00:06:46,840
there it'll take three years to do it

179
00:06:44,769 --> 00:06:49,089
yeah all right it simplifies that

180
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:51,188
process all right so that that's gonna

181
00:06:49,089 --> 00:06:53,619
work to some folks advantage and it's up

182
00:06:51,189 --> 00:06:55,479
to the doc hopefully your doc is liberal

183
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:57,129
and I'm you're gonna find good doctors

184
00:06:55,478 --> 00:06:59,978
there trust me stuff happens

185
00:06:57,129 --> 00:07:03,550
another thing that popped out was they

186
00:06:59,978 --> 00:07:07,089
banned all smokeable medical marijuana

187
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:11,110
so you can't smoke flowers yep that's I

188
00:07:07,089 --> 00:07:15,038
don't like that because I'm gonna be a

189
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:16,569
very odd rule yeah yeah and they're not

190
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:21,188
the only place to do that Florida's

191
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:22,930
currently being sued in there if I sorry

192
00:07:21,189 --> 00:07:25,090
guys it's been a crazy chunk of my life

193
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:27,908
listeners of the show for a while know

194
00:07:25,089 --> 00:07:32,228
that my life's nuts right now but I'm

195
00:07:27,908 --> 00:07:35,709
like 95% sure Florida patients just won

196
00:07:32,228 --> 00:07:38,889
the right to smoke their meds in court

197
00:07:35,709 --> 00:07:41,878
that that that provision of their law

198
00:07:38,889 --> 00:07:44,560
was struck down finally in court but

199
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:47,169
Oklahoma won't be the first to have that

200
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,050
rule and I think a lot of the rules were

201
00:07:47,168 --> 00:07:51,519
about to cover from this point forward

202
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:53,468
if I remember right the governor of

203
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:57,878
Oklahoma was against the legalization

204
00:07:53,468 --> 00:08:00,250
initiative originally which likely means

205
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:03,819
they've been listening to a lot of the

206
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:05,860
national anti-pot people it's one of the

207
00:08:03,819 --> 00:08:07,960
things governor's do if if they've got a

208
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:10,569
position on something from the onset

209
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:13,359
they look for other people arguing for

210
00:08:10,569 --> 00:08:16,778
their position and get the arguments

211
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,669
from those people and I think that's why

212
00:08:16,778 --> 00:08:20,740
we're seeing the list of rules we're

213
00:08:18,668 --> 00:08:24,068
seeing or that we're about to go over is

214
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:25,658
because national Anti Fog groups are

215
00:08:24,069 --> 00:08:28,750
trying a couple of different things to

216
00:08:25,658 --> 00:08:31,028
[ __ ] over the industry they've tried in

217
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:32,528
a couple of states where legalizations

218
00:08:31,028 --> 00:08:34,328
already happen or medical has already

219
00:08:32,528 --> 00:08:37,179
happened and they haven't been

220
00:08:34,328 --> 00:08:38,679
successful but he with Oklahoma they're

221
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:40,989
gonna get some of them implemented from

222
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:43,629
the get-go and we're gonna see how it

223
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:45,459
plays out all right they're supposed to

224
00:08:43,629 --> 00:08:47,198
have another meeting soon there's a

225
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:49,059
deadline set for this meeting I know a

226
00:08:47,198 --> 00:08:50,379
lot of people in Oklahoma

227
00:08:49,059 --> 00:08:52,059
pissed over this is what I was reading

228
00:08:50,379 --> 00:08:53,169
yes we've got friends that brought this

229
00:08:52,059 --> 00:08:54,219
to my attention which is why we're

230
00:08:53,169 --> 00:08:54,939
talking about it so shout out to our

231
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:57,910
friends down there

232
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:59,440
so no smokeable flowers which I I think

233
00:08:57,909 --> 00:09:02,230
that's weird because in my opinion I'm

234
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:05,200
not a doctor in my opinion smoking is

235
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:08,649
the most immediate and effective relief

236
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:10,420
you can smoke and you feel some by the

237
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:12,459
time you're exhaling you feel it if

238
00:09:10,419 --> 00:09:14,319
there's a flower smoker by the time you

239
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:15,730
blow up that flower you you feel it if

240
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,110
you're buzzed AB smoker by the time you

241
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:18,580
blow out that dab you feel it if you

242
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:20,740
can't consume flower you're taking

243
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:23,980
medicine away from people like the most

244
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:26,049
effective obvious old-school traditional

245
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:27,730
way of consuming it is now removed I

246
00:09:26,049 --> 00:09:31,120
think that's ridiculous

247
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:34,060
and they do allow edibles you can have

248
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:36,159
edibles which isn't that where we find

249
00:09:34,059 --> 00:09:38,229
all of our problems like 90% of our

250
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:44,429
problems are with people [ __ ] up with

251
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:48,070
edibles yeah the the path to edibles in

252
00:09:44,429 --> 00:09:49,959
1998 was a lot safer than it is today

253
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:53,010
like just being able to walk it and buy

254
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:55,540
it it's like teenagers with booze like

255
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:58,870
it's it's just not something you should

256
00:09:55,539 --> 00:10:01,179
do without a guide I think or at least

257
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:03,700
like a pamphlet yeah

258
00:10:01,179 --> 00:10:05,379
and a friend to sit there and be like

259
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:12,629
dude you're you're just really baked

260
00:10:05,379 --> 00:10:16,570
calm down also been where a lot of the

261
00:10:12,629 --> 00:10:19,899
stupid problems happen every place that

262
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:22,450
legalizes they get a big wave of poison

263
00:10:19,899 --> 00:10:24,669
center calls the Knights yeah yeah and

264
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:27,610
some of that's because people are stupid

265
00:10:24,669 --> 00:10:30,309
and irresponsible with edibles but a lot

266
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:33,129
of that's because these are exposures

267
00:10:30,309 --> 00:10:34,269
that were happening before and are now

268
00:10:33,129 --> 00:10:35,950
just being reported because of

269
00:10:34,269 --> 00:10:39,549
legalization like it's right it's a good

270
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:43,990
thing health-wise but it's a bad thing

271
00:10:39,549 --> 00:10:45,849
pro-legalization data wise I think I

272
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:49,060
just found it weird that they allow

273
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:51,940
edibles they're easier to hide they're

274
00:10:49,059 --> 00:10:53,619
easier to have too much of I just but

275
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:55,510
you can't smoke a little bit of flour I

276
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:58,509
just didn't like that people seem to

277
00:10:55,509 --> 00:11:00,429
think of him as safer right it's smoking

278
00:10:58,509 --> 00:11:01,990
like that's a main reason why that

279
00:11:00,429 --> 00:11:05,919
markets so popular

280
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:07,028
I get it you're not smoking not ruining

281
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:11,079
your lungs which brings me to another

282
00:11:07,028 --> 00:11:15,539
part they limited potency on flowers to

283
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:19,240
20% and concentrates at 12 percent THC

284
00:11:15,539 --> 00:11:24,219
potency 12 percent on a concentrate

285
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:27,250
that's the way I read it in the press

286
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:28,629
article didn't make a lot of sense how

287
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:30,820
do you have a concentrate with 12

288
00:11:28,629 --> 00:11:33,429
percent in this Lizzy what I mentioned

289
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:35,410
just a minute ago that I think the

290
00:11:33,429 --> 00:11:36,849
governor of Oklahoma may have been

291
00:11:35,409 --> 00:11:40,299
listening to some of the National

292
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:43,080
anti-pot folks limiting THC potency is a

293
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:45,569
big thing project Sam's been pushing

294
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:48,190
they tried it in Colorado and failed

295
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:49,870
they tried it in Canada and failed

296
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:52,810
they've tried it in a couple of other

297
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:54,519
states and failed um and it looks like

298
00:11:52,809 --> 00:11:56,049
they might have succeeded somewhat in

299
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:59,949
Oklahoma and Colorado they were going

300
00:11:56,049 --> 00:12:01,958
for 12 or 16 percent o no cap for flower

301
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:07,089
yeah I do it would have reset the whole

302
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:11,199
industry right this is gonna the way I

303
00:12:07,089 --> 00:12:14,020
read it had the plant potency and it

304
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:18,730
specified it is like your plant potency

305
00:12:14,019 --> 00:12:21,129
can be 20 it didn't specify flower but

306
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:23,589
it made it seem like flower was included

307
00:12:21,129 --> 00:12:26,919
in the 12% limit okay so when I've got a

308
00:12:23,589 --> 00:12:29,589
plant at the end it can be or that plant

309
00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:31,629
contested 20% but my final product

310
00:12:29,589 --> 00:12:35,790
they're not gonna release flower because

311
00:12:31,629 --> 00:12:37,720
flowers are illegal right or can you I

312
00:12:35,789 --> 00:12:39,429
honestly don't know the rules in

313
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:42,700
Oklahoma or the proposed rules in

314
00:12:39,429 --> 00:12:45,699
Oklahoma well enough to know if they

315
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:47,230
allow flowers to be sold for like with

316
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:50,200
the sticker on a this is to be vaped

317
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:51,610
only okay because like tabletop vapes

318
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,649
and flower shapes have been a thing for

319
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:55,720
a decade or right like well it sounds

320
00:12:53,649 --> 00:12:57,070
like your flowers can only test it 20%

321
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,959
and you've got to turn them into a

322
00:12:57,070 --> 00:13:01,690
concentrate that only tests at 12

323
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:06,099
percent THC what kind of sounds like

324
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:07,690
they allow home gross and so like so

325
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:09,820
there's gonna be plenty of flower out

326
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:11,949
and it's not like there's gonna be a

327
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:13,449
possible system for testing flower from

328
00:13:11,948 --> 00:13:14,328
home grows that's going to take a long

329
00:13:13,448 --> 00:13:17,688
time

330
00:13:14,328 --> 00:13:19,488
that's a 20-year project folks so why do

331
00:13:17,688 --> 00:13:20,778
you want to limit the amount of potency

332
00:13:19,489 --> 00:13:23,329
I know because they don't want people

333
00:13:20,778 --> 00:13:25,698
getting getting too high it's the

334
00:13:23,328 --> 00:13:29,688
drumbeat that the anti pot one of the

335
00:13:25,698 --> 00:13:33,109
the notes that they found that resonated

336
00:13:29,688 --> 00:13:37,879
with people is the the weed of the 60s

337
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:41,558
was 1% G the we did today is 30 and the

338
00:13:37,879 --> 00:13:44,749
concentrates go to 90 plus yeah I mean

339
00:13:41,558 --> 00:13:49,039
it's a [ __ ] argument because the we

340
00:13:44,749 --> 00:13:51,369
to the [ __ ] 60s was not 1% if you're

341
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:54,528
curious that number is comes from

342
00:13:51,369 --> 00:13:58,759
including all da seizures which include

343
00:13:54,528 --> 00:14:00,528
feral hemp in so like in 1964 they

344
00:13:58,759 --> 00:14:03,199
rounded up a lot more feral hemp than

345
00:14:00,528 --> 00:14:05,808
then rounded up pounds of Colombian herb

346
00:14:03,198 --> 00:14:11,149
being shipped in and sold freely across

347
00:14:05,808 --> 00:14:13,039
the country and that number got reported

348
00:14:11,149 --> 00:14:15,619
down the chain to us today and so now

349
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:19,399
anti-pop people like it was 1% in 69

350
00:14:15,619 --> 00:14:20,959
right here it says so in the book and I

351
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:24,129
bet they're testing labs back then we're

352
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:26,359
phenomenal well yeah in what gets tested

353
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:28,639
the stick the stand they just put the

354
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:30,528
whole thing in there yeah I have no idea

355
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:32,360
do they test it like they weigh it and

356
00:14:30,528 --> 00:14:35,869
they're like we found this pound of weed

357
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:37,909
before an f-150 this [ __ ] 3500 pounds

358
00:14:35,869 --> 00:14:40,040
of marijuana they tested it with the

359
00:14:37,909 --> 00:14:43,868
f-150 attached to it we ground up the

360
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:49,068
f-150 and it came out 2.0 1% THC but its

361
00:14:43,869 --> 00:14:54,829
THC that's how they do it but the [ __ ]

362
00:14:49,068 --> 00:14:57,409
was I even talking about yeah but some

363
00:14:54,828 --> 00:14:59,328
traits so much percentages the THC

364
00:14:57,409 --> 00:15:02,509
potency we're getting way higher now

365
00:14:59,328 --> 00:15:03,948
it's not our bombs we yeah the it's just

366
00:15:02,509 --> 00:15:07,730
a [ __ ] argument that they've made

367
00:15:03,948 --> 00:15:10,488
that resonates with people and my

368
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:13,159
argument against that is if I'm trying

369
00:15:10,489 --> 00:15:14,480
to medicate and I'm just gonna make up

370
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:16,610
numbers here I don't I don't know the

371
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,289
numbers to my medication you know what I

372
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:19,989
mean this is just hypothetically if I'm

373
00:15:18,289 --> 00:15:22,610
gonna medicate and I need to get to

374
00:15:19,989 --> 00:15:25,399
let's say a thousand right would you

375
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:27,019
rather me take 10 inhalations of

376
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:27,830
something that's at a hundred or would

377
00:15:27,019 --> 00:15:30,889
you rather me take

378
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:32,420
to inhalations of 500 as a medical

379
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:35,299
marijuana patient do you want me to

380
00:15:32,419 --> 00:15:37,610
inhale and exhale smoke or vapor ten

381
00:15:35,299 --> 00:15:41,559
times or two times which is healthier

382
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:44,419
for my lungs and body that's literally

383
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:47,769
like 50% of the reason concentrates

384
00:15:44,419 --> 00:15:50,839
exist is the community wanted a way to

385
00:15:47,769 --> 00:15:53,720
get rid of the actual combustion the

386
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:56,360
unhealthy part of the smoking yeah and

387
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:59,860
we found a way to do that and keep the

388
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:04,250
immediate kick of inhalation we get that

389
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:07,669
that immediate me it and you can titrate

390
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:12,080
it perfectly you take a puff you give it

391
00:16:07,669 --> 00:16:13,610
30 seconds at most and nope I would like

392
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:15,020
another hit when the joint comes around

393
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:17,029
I'm gonna hit it again by the time the

394
00:16:15,019 --> 00:16:19,039
joint comes around again you know no I'm

395
00:16:17,029 --> 00:16:21,049
where I want to be nope I want a little

396
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:24,379
more nope that was a little too much yep

397
00:16:21,049 --> 00:16:27,289
it's it's a beautiful system and we kept

398
00:16:24,379 --> 00:16:28,759
it with vaping and we've it's just

399
00:16:27,289 --> 00:16:30,110
gotten cleaner and cleaner and cleaner

400
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:32,750
and cleaner and healthier and healthier

401
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:33,649
and healthier it's also gotten a lot

402
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:37,429
scarier

403
00:16:33,649 --> 00:16:39,620
and so the anti pop people are able to

404
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:41,539
get footage of somebody doing a DAB and

405
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:45,320
they go on the news and they're like

406
00:16:41,539 --> 00:16:47,419
they're smoking 99% pure THC crystals if

407
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:51,320
they have to smoke with a blowtorch and

408
00:16:47,419 --> 00:16:54,589
then they show that b-roll it scares the

409
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:56,750
[ __ ] out of church folk and then you get

410
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:58,399
12 percent THC limits because I'm

411
00:16:56,750 --> 00:17:02,509
wondering how the [ __ ] they even do that

412
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:05,569
like if the flowers allowed at 20 like

413
00:17:02,509 --> 00:17:08,029
the plants allowed at 20 what do they do

414
00:17:05,569 --> 00:17:11,179
with that 20 percent product they've got

415
00:17:08,029 --> 00:17:13,190
to cut it right yeah yes like keep

416
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:15,289
pouring propylene glycol on it until

417
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:17,420
it's a 12 so what is something like that

418
00:17:15,289 --> 00:17:27,079
yeah I don't I really don't know how you

419
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:28,700
reduce your tomans like time for like if

420
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:31,339
this is gonna be real I know this is all

421
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:33,500
still in the process but if they're

422
00:17:31,339 --> 00:17:35,929
trying to really go with some of these

423
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:38,269
rules you all might want to just pick a

424
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:40,090
day that's not 420 or 710 and get

425
00:17:38,269 --> 00:17:42,700
together at the Capitol

426
00:17:40,089 --> 00:17:46,298
just don't smoke don't [ __ ] wave

427
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:48,130
potli flags just show up let him know

428
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:52,179
why you're there and just [ __ ] sit in

429
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:54,220
the [ __ ] way for like three days but

430
00:17:52,179 --> 00:17:56,710
they need somebody it takes a lot to get

431
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:58,269
these people to notice and if they some

432
00:17:56,710 --> 00:18:00,880
of these rules are as far along as I

433
00:17:58,269 --> 00:18:04,418
think they are like the day for writing

434
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:06,250
op-eds isn't past but like they have

435
00:18:04,419 --> 00:18:07,870
another meeting planned but not

436
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:09,669
scheduled at the time that I wrote this

437
00:18:07,869 --> 00:18:11,379
they had the meeting planned but not

438
00:18:09,669 --> 00:18:13,450
scheduled to talk with the committee

439
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:16,570
that's working on this you know the

440
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:18,429
article I read said I want to say it was

441
00:18:16,569 --> 00:18:19,658
like the Oklahoma Department of Health

442
00:18:18,429 --> 00:18:21,909
and Human Services or somesuch

443
00:18:19,659 --> 00:18:25,630
Department Oklahoma State Department of

444
00:18:21,909 --> 00:18:27,850
Health yes that one when they release

445
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:28,840
these rules they kind of admitted that

446
00:18:27,849 --> 00:18:30,699
they're not sure that they have the

447
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:33,069
authority to make a couple of these

448
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:35,590
rules like they might be totally out of

449
00:18:33,069 --> 00:18:37,359
the scope of their purview but yeah so

450
00:18:35,589 --> 00:18:39,158
if you guys this applies for everywhere

451
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:40,389
that is working on legalization and

452
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:42,039
we're running out of states that are

453
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:43,390
working on it we're getting it's a good

454
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:44,829
thing we're getting two more states that

455
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:46,840
are have got some sort of legalization

456
00:18:44,829 --> 00:18:50,408
but if you're working on getting

457
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:53,199
cannabis legalized wherever you are get

458
00:18:50,409 --> 00:18:55,778
somebody like Micra myself involved like

459
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,399
convince one of us that mikes easy to

460
00:18:55,778 --> 00:18:58,898
get to a city council meeting to help

461
00:18:57,398 --> 00:19:00,849
you write rules you need somebody that

462
00:18:58,898 --> 00:19:03,609
is actually a consumer that's actually

463
00:19:00,849 --> 00:19:06,038
doing this you wouldn't you wouldn't

464
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:07,389
call I'm trying to make a weird weird

465
00:19:06,038 --> 00:19:08,679
[ __ ] analogies you wouldn't call your

466
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:10,210
math teacher to teach you how to work

467
00:19:08,679 --> 00:19:11,860
the buzzsaw and you wouldn't call your

468
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:13,690
shop teacher to teach you how to do math

469
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:16,148
get them get some people that are in the

470
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:17,259
industry up here talking about cannabis

471
00:19:16,148 --> 00:19:18,969
with these people that are making the

472
00:19:17,259 --> 00:19:21,038
rules so when they say so we're gonna do

473
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:22,419
plants at 20% concentrates at twelve I

474
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:23,829
can laugh and shake my head and go wait

475
00:19:22,419 --> 00:19:25,419
you guys have no idea what the [ __ ]

476
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:27,639
you're talking about we can straighten

477
00:19:25,419 --> 00:19:28,960
them out before it gets this far so we

478
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:31,570
got to get we got to get somebody on our

479
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,730
team in these meetings everywhere when

480
00:19:31,569 --> 00:19:37,298
we did the the Oklahoma in Canada

481
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:41,200
episode I stressed like the time to get

482
00:19:37,298 --> 00:19:45,548
involved is now in in Oklahoma the time

483
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:46,120
to get involved like now is now past

484
00:19:45,548 --> 00:19:48,759
tense

485
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:51,759
yeah it's that was like a month ago you

486
00:19:48,759 --> 00:19:55,839
might have to deal with it right now

487
00:19:51,759 --> 00:20:00,009
you're late but continuing to not act is

488
00:19:55,839 --> 00:20:04,418
still a bad choice start writing op-eds

489
00:20:00,009 --> 00:20:06,548
to any local paper any state paper you

490
00:20:04,419 --> 00:20:08,769
can contact the governor you can contact

491
00:20:06,548 --> 00:20:12,129
the state deported out the Board of

492
00:20:08,769 --> 00:20:13,990
Health or whatever that committee is you

493
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:16,750
can email all these people directly and

494
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:19,138
let them know hey I voted for this these

495
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:21,730
are the reasons why these are why

496
00:20:19,138 --> 00:20:24,569
explicitly these specific rules are bad

497
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:26,500
here's what I would like to see instead

498
00:20:24,569 --> 00:20:28,359
you can do it like three or four

499
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:30,778
paragraphs you don't have to do the hi

500
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:33,339
my name is here's why I give a [ __ ] you

501
00:20:30,778 --> 00:20:37,210
can just get right to the meteor issue

502
00:20:33,339 --> 00:20:38,528
hi governor so-and-so I'm writing to you

503
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:40,720
about blank law

504
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:43,058
I don't like blank rule I think it

505
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:45,460
should be this instead so I don't like

506
00:20:43,058 --> 00:20:47,440
the THC caps I think there should be no

507
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:51,399
limit like it isn't at most of the other

508
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:53,980
functioning medical marijuana states if

509
00:20:51,398 --> 00:20:56,408
you want help wording that feel free to

510
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:59,019
contact me on mobile for sensible

511
00:20:56,409 --> 00:21:00,460
cannabis laws on Facebook there you go

512
00:20:59,019 --> 00:21:02,109
follow them on pablo for sensible

513
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:03,880
cannabis laws on facebook support that

514
00:21:02,109 --> 00:21:05,500
you can get updates from Mike speaking

515
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,909
of updates I've got another message from

516
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,380
our friend in Oklahoma that's telling me

517
00:21:06,909 --> 00:21:10,600
what's going on he says there is another

518
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:12,278
meeting in August the Health Department

519
00:21:10,599 --> 00:21:13,658
will meeting get meet again and then

520
00:21:12,278 --> 00:21:17,109
they will have elections coming up in

521
00:21:13,659 --> 00:21:21,190
November so I'm betting before that

522
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:23,379
meeting there will be a period for open

523
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:25,480
comment and then at that meeting

524
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:27,580
there'll be a portion for public comment

525
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:29,048
and it will be one of those fun public

526
00:21:27,579 --> 00:21:33,788
meetings that goes for twelve and a half

527
00:21:29,048 --> 00:21:35,769
hours but during the portion for open

528
00:21:33,788 --> 00:21:39,069
public comment you just email them and

529
00:21:35,769 --> 00:21:40,808
then your email gets distributed to the

530
00:21:39,069 --> 00:21:43,778
whole committee and everybody's supposed

531
00:21:40,808 --> 00:21:46,480
to read them and getting messages across

532
00:21:43,778 --> 00:21:51,250
that way if you get a group of people to

533
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:54,278
do it and most of them are functional

534
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:56,940
communicators you can get a lot of good

535
00:21:54,278 --> 00:21:59,490
change made that way

536
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:01,500
folks in Oklahoma now's the time to

537
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:03,240
start emailing those folks find who you

538
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,859
need to email in your locality in your

539
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:06,690
state find who you need to email in the

540
00:22:04,859 --> 00:22:07,979
state your state rep and let them know

541
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:09,930
that how you want these medical

542
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:11,190
marijuana laws adjusted now's the time

543
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:12,539
to start doing that so start sending out

544
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:14,190
the emails start going to the meetings

545
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:16,859
if you hear anything about a meeting

546
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:17,519
about medical marijuana go attend it be

547
00:22:16,859 --> 00:22:20,879
a part of it

548
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:22,619
rally the troops just go and listen like

549
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:25,860
that's all you have to do to start is

550
00:22:22,619 --> 00:22:29,909
just go and listen and start writing

551
00:22:25,859 --> 00:22:35,729
emails please he also says no grows or

552
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:37,710
dispensaries until August which means

553
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:40,140
most of the zoning rules and all of that

554
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:43,860
haven't been finalized yet either which

555
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:48,900
means people need to start watching for

556
00:22:43,859 --> 00:22:51,479
those briefs in the local paper if

557
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:54,690
you're in Oklahoma right now you should

558
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:57,120
be able to like look up your city or

559
00:22:54,690 --> 00:23:00,960
town or County or whatever they call it

560
00:22:57,119 --> 00:23:04,049
there and find your government's webpage

561
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:06,269
and say you live in Tulsa you should be

562
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:09,509
able to look up the Tulsa City

563
00:23:06,269 --> 00:23:11,519
government's webpage and on there

564
00:23:09,509 --> 00:23:14,609
they'll have their agenda listed for

565
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:17,730
every week and scanning through those

566
00:23:14,609 --> 00:23:22,829
agendas is where I found the meat of all

567
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:25,470
of the zoning rule making hearings here

568
00:23:22,829 --> 00:23:29,099
in Pueblo that stuff didn't make the

569
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:30,450
paper until the day of usually or if it

570
00:23:29,099 --> 00:23:32,789
made the paper at all it would be in a

571
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:35,220
past tense like by the way on Monday you

572
00:23:32,789 --> 00:23:38,250
missed right this happened at this

573
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:39,750
meeting you didn't get to but after two

574
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:42,089
or three weeks of just checking back

575
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:44,309
with the Pueblo City the city of Puebla

576
00:23:42,089 --> 00:23:47,009
webpage I figured out that when they

577
00:23:44,309 --> 00:23:48,359
uploaded their new thing every week and

578
00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:51,150
then I just checked back

579
00:23:48,359 --> 00:23:54,240
I can't think it was Monday's check back

580
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:55,710
Monday at like noon and scan through it

581
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,390
real quick to see if they had anything

582
00:23:55,710 --> 00:24:00,390
that pertained to us and when they did

583
00:23:57,390 --> 00:24:03,330
I'd made sure I was there to the point

584
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:05,340
where I haven't been in a while and City

585
00:24:03,329 --> 00:24:05,788
Council members that have been there for

586
00:24:05,339 --> 00:24:08,579
a while

587
00:24:05,788 --> 00:24:10,528
been asking about where's Mike is he

588
00:24:08,579 --> 00:24:12,628
okay you just disappeared Mike's got a

589
00:24:10,528 --> 00:24:14,220
kid and a brand new kid so Mike's a

590
00:24:12,628 --> 00:24:17,638
little bit distracted folks that's where

591
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:18,808
he is yeah two kids it's a lot there's a

592
00:24:17,638 --> 00:24:20,038
lot to keep you moving will do thanks

593
00:24:18,808 --> 00:24:21,720
for coming and doing a podcast with us

594
00:24:20,038 --> 00:24:23,940
oh it's good to have you here every so

595
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:26,778
often the folks do like your presence on

596
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:28,889
the show they like it when we ramble so

597
00:24:26,778 --> 00:24:31,858
potency what what the hell with the

598
00:24:28,888 --> 00:24:34,168
potency is a [ __ ] up rule y'all yeah

599
00:24:31,858 --> 00:24:35,939
and that's it just isn't it doesn't just

600
00:24:34,169 --> 00:24:37,229
suck for customers the reason the

601
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:40,349
anti-pop people are pushing that is

602
00:24:37,229 --> 00:24:43,229
because it cripples businesses when you

603
00:24:40,348 --> 00:24:45,538
grow out of a strain of cannabis the

604
00:24:43,229 --> 00:24:50,129
potency can vary wildly based on a dozen

605
00:24:45,538 --> 00:24:55,950
different factors your 30% killer arise

606
00:24:50,128 --> 00:24:58,888
like what if I grow it it just there's

607
00:24:55,950 --> 00:25:01,259
so many things that go into it when want

608
00:24:58,888 --> 00:25:02,998
to crop harvests you have no idea if

609
00:25:01,259 --> 00:25:06,929
you've got a 16 or if you've got a 30

610
00:25:02,999 --> 00:25:09,058
and if you send half of your crop off

611
00:25:06,929 --> 00:25:10,590
too early to send off all your testing

612
00:25:09,058 --> 00:25:12,628
samples and half of them come back over

613
00:25:10,589 --> 00:25:14,069
20 if you've got to destroy all that

614
00:25:12,628 --> 00:25:16,199
product yeah

615
00:25:14,069 --> 00:25:18,749
like business can't operate like that

616
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:20,460
especially not with the federal tax laws

617
00:25:18,749 --> 00:25:22,229
on top of our throats and that's part of

618
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:24,450
what sets business apart here in

619
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:25,739
Colorado it's I'm not like this because

620
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:27,509
it's not how I shop but when you walk

621
00:25:25,739 --> 00:25:29,579
into a dispensary you hear half the

622
00:25:27,509 --> 00:25:32,278
people say what's your highest testing

623
00:25:29,579 --> 00:25:33,538
product what's got the most THC a that's

624
00:25:32,278 --> 00:25:34,739
what I want to buy it right now give me

625
00:25:33,538 --> 00:25:35,970
that I don't care what it looks like I

626
00:25:34,739 --> 00:25:38,429
don't care what it smells like I want

627
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:40,558
the most THC a that I'm leaving so

628
00:25:38,429 --> 00:25:44,249
that's kind of a selling point you want

629
00:25:40,558 --> 00:25:45,898
those 30s those 32 s 33 and 34 such it's

630
00:25:44,249 --> 00:25:47,970
hard to find but when you find him that

631
00:25:45,898 --> 00:25:50,038
that's what the people want to buy yep

632
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:51,569
so that's like kind of a you're taking a

633
00:25:50,038 --> 00:25:55,470
strategy away from the market right

634
00:25:51,569 --> 00:25:58,888
there yep it uh it's not just a strategy

635
00:25:55,470 --> 00:26:01,618
away from the market it's just because

636
00:25:58,888 --> 00:26:04,498
then the sales pitches we've got 1999

637
00:26:01,618 --> 00:26:06,509
like come get your 1999 with us come to

638
00:26:04,499 --> 00:26:09,479
chair eleven nine nine with us I would

639
00:26:06,509 --> 00:26:12,720
have to make mistakes to grow 20% THC a

640
00:26:09,479 --> 00:26:13,919
flowers right I just not feed it any new

641
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,130
tree we'd have to cut it down weeks

642
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,340
early

643
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:21,940
yeah I really cut it down a week seven

644
00:26:17,339 --> 00:26:22,720
but uh none of the genetics would be

645
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:24,400
able to work there

646
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,769
it's a rule they're pimping by design

647
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,690
like it's this is a thought out strategy

648
00:26:26,769 --> 00:26:32,379
it's not something they've stumbled upon

649
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:34,480
because they're scared they're able to

650
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:36,760
sell it because it scares people that

651
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:39,819
won't look into it very deeply but

652
00:26:36,759 --> 00:26:42,220
that's I mean it's just one of the rules

653
00:26:39,819 --> 00:26:44,259
that they're pushing right now they they

654
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:45,910
they also want it like the skull in the

655
00:26:44,259 --> 00:26:49,558
crossbones and the three pages of

656
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:51,490
warnings right product yeah yeah yeah

657
00:26:49,558 --> 00:26:54,279
well if they get it figured out down

658
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:55,298
there let's move on to the socionics you

659
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:57,369
guys forgetting I figure it out I hope

660
00:26:55,298 --> 00:26:58,690
you guys keep going to meetings and get

661
00:26:57,369 --> 00:27:01,119
it dialed in because what you got right

662
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:02,470
now is gonna be a challenge yep let's

663
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:06,428
move forward I've got another subject

664
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:07,990
here a while back there was whoa I just

665
00:27:06,429 --> 00:27:10,509
let's make sure we didn't just kill that

666
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:12,819
recording we're still going saying well

667
00:27:10,509 --> 00:27:14,859
back there was a chain of dispensaries

668
00:27:12,819 --> 00:27:16,808
that got in trouble for doing a thing

669
00:27:14,859 --> 00:27:19,629
that was called looping what looping is

670
00:27:16,808 --> 00:27:21,490
is basically in the state of Colorado a

671
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:23,650
recreational cannabis purchaser is

672
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:28,630
allowed to buy one ounce of recreational

673
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:33,038
cannabis per day one uno i'ts one out to

674
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:34,390
get one and if so what was happening

675
00:27:33,038 --> 00:27:36,879
these guys were buying their one ounce

676
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:38,140
they were going out to the car I don't

677
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,520
know what was really happening but then

678
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:41,200
they were coming back within the same

679
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:43,389
business day and they were buying more

680
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:47,319
ounces well and for a long time in

681
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:49,390
Colorado the law specifically says I can

682
00:27:47,319 --> 00:27:50,220
sell you one ounce of marijuana per

683
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:54,580
transaction

684
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:58,950
the law says transaction that's the word

685
00:27:54,579 --> 00:28:02,740
in the law and so four years in Colorado

686
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:05,798
transaction was the practice to most

687
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:08,200
stores didn't care if you came in bought

688
00:28:05,798 --> 00:28:10,509
your limit came back in five or ten or

689
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:13,200
30 minutes bought your limit again and

690
00:28:10,509 --> 00:28:15,908
left they just enjoyed the extra sale

691
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:19,090
that's that's what looping is that's

692
00:28:15,909 --> 00:28:20,799
where this stemmed from eventually the

693
00:28:19,089 --> 00:28:22,899
marijuana Enforcement Division and the

694
00:28:20,798 --> 00:28:23,579
Colorado Department of Revenue realized

695
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:26,070
the

696
00:28:23,579 --> 00:28:28,409
this was kind of a loophole so they sent

697
00:28:26,069 --> 00:28:28,919
out a memo saying you cannot do this

698
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:31,620
anymore

699
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:35,220
at that point most dispensaries stopped

700
00:28:31,619 --> 00:28:39,209
they formed they formed a group to

701
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:43,589
change the law and make the one ounce

702
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:46,079
per day official law and then they sent

703
00:28:43,589 --> 00:28:48,750
out a memo saying the law that we're

704
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:53,629
gonna pass in January goes into effect

705
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:56,359
in August and the marijuana industry

706
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:59,610
operating under the rules that they do

707
00:28:56,359 --> 00:29:02,459
most of the industry complied because

708
00:28:59,609 --> 00:29:04,259
when we get a memo from the meed we just

709
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:07,049
say sir yes sir how many would you like

710
00:29:04,259 --> 00:29:09,390
sir yeah like we don't ask questions we

711
00:29:07,049 --> 00:29:11,039
don't ask for clarification we just try

712
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:13,440
really hard to do whatever they say

713
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:17,430
that's a great segue into the article

714
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:19,049
that I'm about to read this is why the

715
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:20,610
industry kisses the Emmy B's ass a

716
00:29:19,049 --> 00:29:22,859
little bit this article comes from a

717
00:29:20,609 --> 00:29:26,969
website called Mary Jane comm it's Emmy

718
00:29:22,859 --> 00:29:28,439
rry Jane comm Mary Jane excuse me for

719
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:29,549
the throat-clearing in this episode we

720
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,809
talked about all the dads really this

721
00:29:29,549 --> 00:29:33,329
article is written by a person who was

722
00:29:30,809 --> 00:29:35,369
named Chris Moore and it goes like this

723
00:29:33,329 --> 00:29:37,349
sweet leaf lost all of its been fur

724
00:29:35,369 --> 00:29:41,639
based cannabis licenses for looping or

725
00:29:37,349 --> 00:29:43,529
selling more than weed per customer yeah

726
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,759
26 licenses I read the article one of

727
00:29:43,529 --> 00:29:47,009
them caught one of Colorado's largest

728
00:29:44,759 --> 00:29:48,539
cannabis enterprises just lost the right

729
00:29:47,009 --> 00:29:50,400
to do business in Denver after getting

730
00:29:48,539 --> 00:29:52,019
busted for selling unlawful amounts of

731
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:54,150
weed to their customers sweet leaf this

732
00:29:52,019 --> 00:29:56,490
is successful can a company operating a

733
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:58,110
number of legally license cultivation

734
00:29:56,490 --> 00:30:00,210
and processing facilities as well as

735
00:29:58,109 --> 00:30:01,349
dispensaries all across the state was

736
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:03,900
the subject of a year-long investigation

737
00:30:01,349 --> 00:30:06,209
by local authorities working to track

738
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:07,769
down on loop to crack down on looping

739
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:09,990
the practice of selling customers more

740
00:30:07,769 --> 00:30:11,250
marijuana than state law allows I'm

741
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:13,950
gonna kind of skim over this cuz it's

742
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:16,470
longer than I wanted to go but I've got

743
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:18,150
to get you all the main points we talked

744
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:21,630
about Colorado customers can only buy

745
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:23,280
one ounce per day sweet leaf argued they

746
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:25,530
reportedly use justification to let

747
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:27,930
customers purchase more than legally

748
00:30:25,529 --> 00:30:30,629
allowed police raided eight stores in

749
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:32,759
Denver in March and in April Denver

750
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:34,890
officials held hearings on disciplinary

751
00:30:32,759 --> 00:30:36,569
actions against stores accused of

752
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:37,070
looping Siddeley City Attorney showed up

753
00:30:36,569 --> 00:30:39,349
with

754
00:30:37,069 --> 00:30:41,480
of evidence against sweet leaf including

755
00:30:39,349 --> 00:30:43,369
video of undercover cops purchasing

756
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:45,019
prohibited amounts of weed from their

757
00:30:43,369 --> 00:30:48,648
stores as well as interviews with the

758
00:30:45,019 --> 00:30:50,839
company's employees he estimated the

759
00:30:48,648 --> 00:30:52,518
attorneys estimated that one single

760
00:30:50,839 --> 00:30:54,439
sweet leaf dispensary made over one

761
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:56,630
thousand looping transactions netting

762
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:58,659
the company an additional four million

763
00:30:56,630 --> 00:31:01,278
dollars

764
00:30:58,659 --> 00:31:03,139
there's a reason companies were willing

765
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:05,210
to do this yeah for million dollars it

766
00:31:03,138 --> 00:31:07,668
sounds like a decent reason but look it

767
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:10,579
bit him in the ass then it says this

768
00:31:07,669 --> 00:31:13,340
week the Denver department of excise and

769
00:31:10,579 --> 00:31:14,990
licenses revoked all 26 of sweet leaves

770
00:31:13,339 --> 00:31:17,119
medical marijuana and recreational

771
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:19,038
marijuana licenses effectively

772
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:21,768
preventing the company from continuing

773
00:31:19,038 --> 00:31:23,269
to do business in the city of Denver see

774
00:31:21,769 --> 00:31:24,409
that's what happens you guys we're not

775
00:31:23,269 --> 00:31:26,329
[ __ ] around everyone thinks we're

776
00:31:24,409 --> 00:31:27,830
just hanging out getting high the G can

777
00:31:26,329 --> 00:31:29,388
come in and buy a bunch of weed and then

778
00:31:27,829 --> 00:31:30,470
just hang out take a couple of dabs in

779
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:32,569
the back with the people that work there

780
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:36,230
no brother you [ __ ] up they'll come in

781
00:31:32,569 --> 00:31:38,720
and take all of your licensing is in

782
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:39,649
Denver is five thousand Alliance so they

783
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,720
were paying one hundred and thirty

784
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:42,918
thousand a year to the city and one

785
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:45,829
hundred thirty thousand a year to the

786
00:31:42,919 --> 00:31:48,740
state for those licenses they lost just

787
00:31:45,829 --> 00:31:51,710
to have the licenses just I have yeah

788
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:53,450
they were making an additional four

789
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:55,009
million through looping what were they

790
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:58,069
making through those twenty six

791
00:31:55,009 --> 00:31:59,929
facilities without looping they were one

792
00:31:58,069 --> 00:32:01,220
of the largest outfits in Colorado yeah

793
00:31:59,929 --> 00:32:08,210
they were huge everybody knew who

794
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:10,339
sweetleaf was several grows several

795
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:12,980
stores the company does have the right

796
00:32:10,339 --> 00:32:15,319
to appeal the decision they also still

797
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:17,269
have licenses not in Denver yes that is

798
00:32:15,319 --> 00:32:19,460
actually they have a location in Oregon

799
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:22,460
somewhere they've got one in Aurora I

800
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:24,919
think they've got one in Thornton there

801
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:25,669
might be one in Colorado Springs anyway

802
00:32:24,919 --> 00:32:26,960
I'm gonna keep reading the article

803
00:32:25,669 --> 00:32:28,580
there's like two short paragraphs left

804
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:31,220
it says enforcing rules when violations

805
00:32:28,579 --> 00:32:33,678
occur occur is an essential part of

806
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:35,899
Denver's successful regulation of one of

807
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:36,590
the largest legalized marijuana markets

808
00:32:35,898 --> 00:32:38,298
in the world

809
00:32:36,589 --> 00:32:40,308
Kilroy said in a statement reported by

810
00:32:38,298 --> 00:32:41,929
the westward suite leaves the illegal

811
00:32:40,308 --> 00:32:44,119
actions undermine the entire regulatory

812
00:32:41,929 --> 00:32:46,278
framework created by amendment 64 the

813
00:32:44,119 --> 00:32:48,859
journal Assembly and the Denver City

814
00:32:46,278 --> 00:32:50,569
Council the decision supports the will

815
00:32:48,859 --> 00:32:50,939
of the voters for a regulated legal

816
00:32:50,569 --> 00:32:52,649
Merrill

817
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:54,150
on a market safeguards the legal

818
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:56,460
marijuana industry and protects the

819
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:58,530
safety and welfare of the public

820
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:59,910
like Mike said sweet leaf still runs

821
00:32:58,529 --> 00:33:01,680
three other dispensaries in the state

822
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:04,110
which are not affected by this ruling

823
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:06,450
and will remain open many of the

824
00:33:04,109 --> 00:33:08,549
company's bud tenders have been arrested

825
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:10,259
in connection with the investigation but

826
00:33:08,549 --> 00:33:13,710
the majority of them have now been

827
00:33:10,259 --> 00:33:15,509
released without criminal charges so you

828
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:17,549
guys if you mess around with em Edie

829
00:33:15,509 --> 00:33:19,410
they will come rager stores it will take

830
00:33:17,549 --> 00:33:20,669
the bud tenders to jail a lot of people

831
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:21,900
were taken straight to jail a lot of

832
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:24,300
them were released some of them did face

833
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:27,090
charges then they will shut down your

834
00:33:24,299 --> 00:33:30,659
business there's a lot of talk that this

835
00:33:27,089 --> 00:33:35,069
story isn't over yet this was sort of a

836
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:39,150
death blow to the company but they still

837
00:33:35,069 --> 00:33:40,259
have several locations they I'm guessing

838
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:43,590
they've still got at least one or two

839
00:33:40,259 --> 00:33:47,879
grows going they're certainly not

840
00:33:43,589 --> 00:33:51,389
completely dead right ah and with that

841
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:54,530
many bud tenders arrested that many bud

842
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:57,150
tenders set free with no charges and

843
00:33:54,529 --> 00:33:59,119
currently no management or ownership has

844
00:33:57,150 --> 00:34:01,890
been charged with a single thing like

845
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:04,309
this story definitely has the potential

846
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:07,230
to go on for longer if they're just

847
00:34:04,309 --> 00:34:10,469
compiling and thinking still giving in a

848
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:12,539
minute and letting the Rope sit there

849
00:34:10,469 --> 00:34:14,309
and waiting to see what kind of knot you

850
00:34:12,539 --> 00:34:16,469
tie at the end of it all right well if

851
00:34:14,309 --> 00:34:19,289
anybody sticks their head through the

852
00:34:16,469 --> 00:34:22,439
end of that knot we will definitely let

853
00:34:19,289 --> 00:34:24,619
you guys know sweet leaf no more in

854
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:28,829
Denver nope

855
00:34:24,619 --> 00:34:32,219
did do you see the story this week you

856
00:34:28,829 --> 00:34:34,049
saw that the public consumption buses

857
00:34:32,219 --> 00:34:38,969
got [ __ ] with in Denver right yes

858
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:41,039
there was one day where Denver somebody

859
00:34:38,969 --> 00:34:43,559
I think it was a multi-agency Saudi PD

860
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:45,420
and the meed and a couple of other

861
00:34:43,559 --> 00:34:48,059
groups got together and they raided two

862
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:50,250
of the buses and they gave everybody

863
00:34:48,059 --> 00:34:54,469
public consumption tickets and [ __ ]

864
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:57,179
cited the driver and cited the company

865
00:34:54,469 --> 00:35:00,149
for basically hosting an unlicensed

866
00:34:57,179 --> 00:35:02,399
consumption event and then left like

867
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:04,010
there weren't like mass arrests the

868
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:07,780
company didn't have to bail for

869
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:10,490
tourists on every County or anything but

870
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:12,530
it was announced this week that that was

871
00:35:10,489 --> 00:35:15,709
because of the CNN footage from New

872
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:18,110
Year's Eve oh that makes sense where CNN

873
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:22,970
reporter was flashing the [ __ ] gas

874
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:25,160
masks bong and [ __ ] Mike said

875
00:35:22,969 --> 00:35:28,279
consumption bus some folks may not know

876
00:35:25,159 --> 00:35:31,759
what those words mean like that

877
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:33,590
consumption bus what so a while back

878
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:39,890
Colorado decided that it was illegal to

879
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:40,910
consume links drivers blocked off like

880
00:35:39,889 --> 00:35:43,369
they're in their own airtight chamber

881
00:35:40,909 --> 00:35:46,129
away from the rest of the fun bus so

882
00:35:43,369 --> 00:35:47,299
Colorado outlawed smoking in a public

883
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:48,559
place you can't we can't smoke at

884
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:50,269
gatherings anymore that are indoors

885
00:35:48,559 --> 00:35:53,570
that's not allowed

886
00:35:50,269 --> 00:35:55,699
but you can rent a private bus and pull

887
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:57,230
it up right outside of the club and let

888
00:35:55,699 --> 00:35:59,059
people that are 21 and over onto that

889
00:35:57,230 --> 00:36:00,740
bus and then they can bring their own

890
00:35:59,059 --> 00:36:02,659
concentrates and they can smoke out in

891
00:36:00,739 --> 00:36:05,479
the bus or at least that's been

892
00:36:02,659 --> 00:36:06,980
happening on the regular for five years

893
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:09,619
now yeah we thought that that was cool

894
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:11,389
but on New Year's a reporter came and

895
00:36:09,619 --> 00:36:12,829
did a little article and featured one of

896
00:36:11,389 --> 00:36:13,519
the buses and was like hey look we're

897
00:36:12,829 --> 00:36:16,250
doing this

898
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:17,480
and so that triggered the marijuana

899
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:19,219
Enforcement Division the Denver

900
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:21,019
Department of the Denver Police

901
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:23,419
Department and whoever else decided to

902
00:36:21,019 --> 00:36:25,820
jump in that day they decided one night

903
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:29,119
to go and take down a couple of the

904
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:31,820
private party consumption buses so they

905
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:34,489
were they were working on this big case

906
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:37,250
for like six bucking monster took him

907
00:36:34,489 --> 00:36:39,619
six months to go hit the consumption bus

908
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:43,039
yeah they take their time when they're

909
00:36:39,619 --> 00:36:45,409
busted stoners they knew they weren't

910
00:36:43,039 --> 00:36:48,469
going anywhere on the bus who knew where

911
00:36:45,409 --> 00:36:52,460
to find him it's it's one of those

912
00:36:48,469 --> 00:36:54,739
things where it was so poorly done on

913
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:56,570
law enforcement it's part of like the

914
00:36:54,739 --> 00:37:00,529
companies are [ __ ] through suing the

915
00:36:56,570 --> 00:37:02,240
city and hourlies threatening to they're

916
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:04,220
not at all amused their lawyers are

917
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:05,989
pissed right this has been going on for

918
00:37:04,219 --> 00:37:08,149
years now if somebody had a problem with

919
00:37:05,989 --> 00:37:10,189
it a letter in the first six months of

920
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:14,300
operation would've taken care of it it

921
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:17,210
has lessened the need or desire for me

922
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:19,580
to illegally consume cannabis inside

923
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:22,039
a venue if I'm seeing a reggae band and

924
00:37:19,579 --> 00:37:24,230
I know that the dab bus is right outside

925
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:26,210
and I'll just go out there and take a

926
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:28,159
DAB you know there's no need to smoke a

927
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:29,449
joint illegally in the reggae show I

928
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:31,129
just go out there and take a quick dab

929
00:37:29,449 --> 00:37:35,269
between bands and come right back in and

930
00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:37,039
see the concert I'm part of me still

931
00:37:35,269 --> 00:37:41,599
just kind of pissed that we have to have

932
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:45,440
this fight still yeah right like we've

933
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:47,809
we legalized marijuana it's been common

934
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:51,230
practice to consume marijuana it big

935
00:37:47,809 --> 00:37:52,610
public gatherings for I can't even tell

936
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:54,079
you how long literally every [ __ ]

937
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:57,620
concert I've ever been to since the time

938
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:59,119
I was five there ought to be a place at

939
00:37:57,619 --> 00:38:00,500
every concert venue where it's like oh

945
00:38:09,679 --> 00:38:14,089
the roof yeah like it's we don't need

946
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:15,740
[ __ ] special buses but apparently we

947
00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:19,180
needed special buses and now they're not

948
00:38:15,739 --> 00:38:21,259
even sure if we can have the buses like

949
00:38:19,179 --> 00:38:23,329
it's just such a headache

950
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:24,740
yep so again guys I know I always talk

951
00:38:23,329 --> 00:38:26,449
about writing rules and being involved

952
00:38:24,739 --> 00:38:28,039
in legislation sure there's consumption

953
00:38:26,449 --> 00:38:29,629
room make sure there's somewhere that

954
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:32,239
you can consume when you write your new

955
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:34,010
rules bring that up get that on the

956
00:38:32,239 --> 00:38:35,299

two seconds
