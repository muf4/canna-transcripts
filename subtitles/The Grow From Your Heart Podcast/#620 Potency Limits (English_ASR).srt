168
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:41,839
before i broke my fingers so

169
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:43,439
listeners if you ever think don't do

170
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:45,279
that you're going to break a finger

171
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:46,879
i advise you to not do that because

172
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:48,399
you're probably going to

173
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:50,159
know if you gave me the option though if

174
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:51,918
break a finger or somebody's dog get hit

175
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,199
by a car i'll sacrifice my finger for

176
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:54,719
almost for sure

177
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,240
just you know i'm just down so you did

178
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,440
the right thing i would have still reach

179
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,720
out and help the dog you guys help the

180
00:04:57,439 --> 00:04:59,120

181
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,720
man

182
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,840
your finger will heal maybe the dog

183
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,120
would have gotten hurt worse i don't

184
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:04,799
know mike's a big dude he can deal with

185
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,879
that the [ __ ] pinkie will be okay

186
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,840
anyway it's just it's amusing and

187
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:09,439
annoying it's just

188
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:11,279
it gets to be amusing and annoying for

189
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:13,680
like six weeks yeah what i've noticed

190
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:15,758
about youtube is if there is a thing

191
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,038
somebody will address it and if we don't

192
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,319
they will and now we don't have to

193
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:19,839
answer the comments because we already

194
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:21,038
did

195
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:22,239
that's just how social media and the

196
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:24,240
internet work now mike i've been doing

197
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,160
this for way too long i guess is it

198
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,600
jaded or programmed or just aware which

199
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,720

201
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,520
of professional and experience we do

202
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:34,799
have a podcast i do have notes we do

203
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:38,159
have some [ __ ] to talk about

204
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:40,319
um a topic with i've got

205
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,160
like four one two three if i got five

206
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:44,879
little uh bullet points here

207
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,680
actually tabs open wow mike's doing it

208
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:47,439
real all right

209
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,560
um let's keep this going before we ruin

210
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:52,319
the appearance um

211
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,160
they love it when we ramble they sure do

212
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:55,599
use they like it when we ramble when you

213
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,479
talk about the podcast that helps us

214
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,120
find the show

215
00:05:56,478 --> 00:06:00,478
so um mike's taking a rip off that maybe

216
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,560
i can get this out now

217
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:03,680
mike has told me recently that there are

218
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,800
proposed

219
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:09,439
potency limits in colorado for

220
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,120
cannabis and concentrates and possibly

221
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:12,879
edibles i didn't ask that far

222
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,319
i also failed to ask if this was for

223
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:16,240
recreational or

224
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,000
for uh medical cannabis but i figured

225
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,519
that would be a great topic for the show

226
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,120
i didn't ask a lot of questions i wanted

227
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:22,318
to save it all here and be fresh

228
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,600
i didn't want to blow it all in the

229
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:28,479
hallway so uh let's talk about this mike

230
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,319
they are proposing making potency limits

231
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:31,120
on cannabis here in colorado my first

232
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,520
question of course

233
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,199
is this medical or recreational cannabis

234
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:38,159
that they're trying to mess with here

235
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,360
the proposed bill would affect both med

236
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:43,439
and rec

237
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:45,759
um so both right now

238
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:46,560
this is just in colorado but the people

239
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:50,000
behind it

240
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:52,560
are national okay or at least connected

241
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
to a network of national anti-cannabis

242
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,680
organizations

243
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,439
organization it's one national org

244
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,800
um and then each one of their members

245
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:03,279
runs and

246
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,400
their own little state group and it's

247
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:07,038
usually just

248
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:10,478
five or six annoying parents working

249
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:14,240
together in concert on social media but

250
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:18,159
um over the last nine years they've

251
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:20,240
slowly built a foothold of support

252
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,680
in state legislatures including

253
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:25,519
colorado's

254
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:27,280
so right now in colorado um

255
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:29,279
pardon if i wander from the mic i'm

256
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:31,359
reading

257
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:32,638
um as the language reads at the time of

258
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,240
this writing which was

259
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:38,400
february 17th of this year

260
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,800
uh we have a proposed bill that would

261
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:42,560
cap thc potency at 15

262
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,478
for both medical and recreational

263
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,959
marijuana products

264
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:49,159
presumably for edibles they're going to

265
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:52,318
leave that with the 100 milligram

266
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:55,599
recreational limit and what is it 300

267
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:57,680
package for med i think so

268
00:07:55,598 --> 00:07:59,038
uh might be higher but anyway anyway

269
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,000
it's been so long since i've bought a

270
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:02,000
matt edible

271
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,279
um they'll probably leave the med limits

272
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,560
alone for

273
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:07,198
the potency limits for edibles alone for

274
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,759
now

275
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,879
but this would apply to flowers and

276
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,598
concentrates

277
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:16,080
okay um if that sounds insane to some of

278
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:19,759
y'all there's some reasons for that

279
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:23,918
yeah it should sound the

280
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:25,840
legislation excuse me tongue tied

281
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:27,279
the representative behind this bill and

282
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:29,918
i'm going to butcher her name and i

283
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:34,519
apologize for that it is not intentional

284
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:37,679
um i'm just bad at this is yadra

285
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:39,599
kavio um she's a

286
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:41,359
colorado representative from thornton

287
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:45,360
she's the sponsor of the bill

288
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:47,600
she's also a pediatrician and her

289
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,480
slant on this is that high potency

290
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,879
cannabis products are bad for teenagers

291
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,879
and so they shouldn't exist in the legal

292
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:58,000
market in colorado

293
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:59,838
that's their starting off point and over

294
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,759
the years they've slowly built a

295
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:04,000
foothold in the legislature where

296
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:05,759
this bill is instead of getting laughed

297
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,879
out of the door

298
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:10,958
is slowly working its way through the

299
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:13,278
process of becoming a bill

300
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:15,518
but the products aren't for teenagers so

301
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:18,958
that shouldn't even be a thing

302
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:22,560
it shouldn't be um but

303
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:26,159
if you're 18 you can shop medically

304
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:27,838
and they're it's

305
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:29,278
the think of the kids angle is just what

306
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:32,320
it's always been it's just

307
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:33,759
a ploy or a ruse yeah

308
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,040
the lawyer brain and me goes well yeah

309
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:36,080
you don't want the teenagers to have it

310
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:37,838
that's fine we don't sell it to

311
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,519
teenagers

312
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,760
you've got to be 21 to get it yeah

313
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,679
that's that's how we stop that

314
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:45,360
if you're in the dispensary shopping

315
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:48,239
legally under 18

316
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,440
you have two physicians monitoring your

317
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,879
care

318
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:54,880
um it's it's not willy-nilly

319
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:56,720
a parent has to do all the shopping like

320
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:59,439
it's

321
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,200
um it's very regulated in colorado more

322
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,320
regulated than anything else we have

323
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,680
here

324
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:09,040
but um the antipop groups

325
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:10,078
maybe four years ago realized that they

326
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:14,319
didn't have

327
00:10:10,078 --> 00:10:17,039
a prayer uh of getting a repeal passed

328
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,480
through the vote there's no way that the

329
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:21,039
voters are going to vote

330
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,079
out marijuana once it's been voted it's

331
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:23,599
just not going to happen

332
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:25,599
oh there's so much money it's not going

333
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:29,200
anywhere with all the money it makes

334
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:32,560
yep um so

335
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:34,640
two years ago i think they tried to do

336
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:37,759
a ballot measure that would do the same

337
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:40,879
thing cap potency at 15

338
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:43,759
um their ballot measure

339
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:46,320
went nowhere because one of the

340
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:48,799
marijuana industry groups in denver

341
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,959
hired the two or three signature

342
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:52,719
gathering firms in colorado and just

343
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:55,278
said you're busy now

344
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,040
when they call don't answer the phone

345
00:10:55,278 --> 00:11:00,240
here's your finder's fee

346
00:10:57,039 --> 00:11:03,519
and that was the end of that the 15

347
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,480
uh 15 potency bill that was going to go

348
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:07,679
through the ballot

349
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:10,159
um system like legalization did that's

350
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:11,359
dirty politics that's planned dirty i i

351
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:12,399
hate to say how much i like that

352
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,399
approach

353
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,320
it is plain dirty but i like that our

354
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,879
side's plain dirty considering

355
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,000
these laws were playing dirty to begin

356
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:21,600
with like

357
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,440
there were never a bunch of doctors that

358
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,360
were like hey this is hurting people we

359
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,480
should make it harder to get

360
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:30,320
it was always politicians going you know

361
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,519
life would be easier if poor and brown

362
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,200
people couldn't vote

363
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:35,278
yeah so why don't we make the stuff that

364
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:38,320
they like to do when they're off hours

365
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:40,078
illegal and we can just arrest them

366
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:43,040
and make them felons and then we don't

367
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:46,078
ever have to count their votes again

368
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:49,039
um so when we did that two years ago

369
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:50,879
i thought that's funny like i would have

370
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:52,399
preferred a good good old-fashioned

371
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:55,919
shellacking

372
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:57,679
and i liked that they were completely

373
00:11:55,919 --> 00:12:00,159
thwarted by having to be

374
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:02,319
grassroots like if they can't hire

375
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:04,639
people to do the signature gathering

376
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,800
that means they would have to have a

377
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,320
broad base of support willing to do it

378
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:09,679
themselves

379
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,278
and this happens all the time in

380
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:12,239
colorado it might be harder in other

381
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:14,958
places but

382
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,560
we have at least one active recall

383
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:18,000
effort going all the time

384
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:21,039
right where a group of people is trying

385
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,278
to oust a politician or change a law

386
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:24,719
and so signature gathering gathering's

387
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:26,639
pretty common here

388
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,480
this could have been done if they had

389
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:31,759
support and they didn't

390
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,800
um so now they're back and they found a

391
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:35,679
representative from

392
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:37,599
thornton to sponsor the bill they were

393
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:39,278
trying to keep it a secret in a draft

394
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,040
got left in a copier somewhere or

395
00:12:39,278 --> 00:12:43,759
something and they got outed about

396
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:47,199
three months ago um since then there's

397
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:47,200
been some reporting on it

398
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:50,320
um the bill wants to do some other stuff

399
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:52,078
too like it's

400
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,839
uh it wants to create a medical

401
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:56,078
marijuana monitoring program

402
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,600
so patients purchases are tracked in a

403
00:12:56,078 --> 00:13:02,319
statewide system

404
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,320
they can try to limit looping

405
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:07,039
they want better tracking of the patient

406
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,480
doctor relationship

407
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:09,838
so that they can make sure that the

408
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,278
doctor that signed your medical

409
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,200
marijuana card

410
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:15,200
is really monitoring your progress and

411
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,200
your health and all of that

412
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,040
they want data collection to track the

413
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:23,120
effects of high potency thc

414
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:23,519
products um it seeks to protect public

415
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,039
health

416
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,200
through potency limits and the

417
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:29,759
prohibition of dangerous products used

418
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:33,519
by underage youth

419
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:34,799
ah sorry i'm reading

420
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,240
yeah they just want to be all up in my

421
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:37,679
business i'm a [ __ ] adult i've

422
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,519
already got a medical marijuana card

423
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:41,039
from my doctor who approves

424
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,720
and there's no reason for anybody else

425
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:44,240
to step in that's one of my favorite

426
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,199
things about medical cannabis is that i

427
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,799
can dose

428
00:13:45,198 --> 00:13:48,958
myself without i know i'm not going to

429
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:50,958
kill myself so i could dose myself

430
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:52,239
if it still hurts i could take more if

431
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:53,119
it doesn't hurt so much i don't have to

432
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,680
take as much

433
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,560
i don't need somebody involved that

434
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:58,479
doesn't know what the [ __ ] they're

435
00:13:56,559 --> 00:14:01,599
talking about in my medicine

436
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,159
yeah it's not like a number of other

437
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,720
medicines

438
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:06,319
that we have in the house like it's a

439
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,639
little weird cannabis is the only

440
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:12,079
medicine in my house that's locked up

441
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,799
but there are a bunch of medicines in my

442
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:15,359
house

443
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:16,958
that will harm my kids if my kids eat

444
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,560
the whole container

445
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:20,638
and with the cannabis if that were to

446
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:22,879
happen it'd just be sleepy time for

447
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:23,839
quite a while right and you'd probably

448
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:25,600
face way more

449
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:27,360
legal problems if they ate your cannabis

450
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:31,199
than if they ate the bottle of bleach

451
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:32,879
yeah um it's really unfortunate

452
00:14:31,198 --> 00:14:36,000
that the laws are still as screwed up as

453
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:38,240
they are especially around this but uh

454
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,839
it's basically nonsense there's so many

455
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,959
different facets of why this is

456
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,680
horseshit

457
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:44,159
like they say they picked the 15 number

458
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:46,879
because

459
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:48,319
that's where other countries have found

460
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:51,919
um

461
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:54,800
terror bad effects on cannabis products

462
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:56,879
and it's just a myth like we've had

463
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:59,919
hashish

464
00:14:56,879 --> 00:15:03,600
since pre-history um

465
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:07,439
we know through modern testing

466
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:09,040
that um like hand rub hash

467
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,800
old school hash that's been around since

468
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:13,120
the 70s um

469
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:16,078
dry sieve hash that's been around since

470
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,600
the i mean i've i said the 60s and 70s

471
00:15:16,078 --> 00:15:19,278
it's been around a hell of a lot longer

472
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,120
than that um

473
00:15:19,278 --> 00:15:23,278
that's when it got popular again in the

474
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:26,000
u.s in popular culture

475
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:26,879
but uh these forms of hash are like 30

476
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,078
to 60

477
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:33,759
pure that's been true

478
00:15:30,078 --> 00:15:35,198
the whole time if making cannabis

479
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:37,278
products more pure

480
00:15:35,198 --> 00:15:40,078
led to more negative outcomes we would

481
00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:42,879
have noticed a long [ __ ] time ago

482
00:15:40,078 --> 00:15:43,519
um you and i would be displaying it

483
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:45,360
right

484
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:48,879
or uh during the clinical trials for

485
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:50,879
marinol or its knockoffs

486
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:52,320
we would have found something other than

487
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:54,159
what we see

488
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,680
like we've all been around people that

489
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:57,679
consumed too much cannabis and got a

490
00:15:55,679 --> 00:16:00,638
little too high and it's like oh buddy

491
00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:02,799
you need a snickers and like a chair yep

492
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,399
here's a gatorade and a burrito

493
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:06,240
you know that's your prescription to get

494
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:07,600
better from your weed overdose

495
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,919
take a little bit of a nap and you'll be

496
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:13,600
just fine yep

497
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:16,240
i mean maybe first timers who way overdo

498
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:18,320
it like still high at breakfast

499
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,000
but like a lot of that's just because

500
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,959
you're in a better mood and you see the

501
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,958
world better

502
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:24,319
yeah like any edibles to still be high

503
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:27,599
at breakfast [ __ ]

504
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:29,680
but uh like they're 15 number they're

505
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,600
picking as trash

506
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:33,278
they like to pretend that that's where

507
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,000
cannabis gets dangerous because that's

508
00:16:33,278 --> 00:16:36,078
the number

509
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,679
britain randomly picked like 30 years

510
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:42,239
ago to differ

511
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:44,078
or to differentiate between um

512
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,919
can't regular cannabis and what they

513
00:16:44,078 --> 00:16:48,958
call skunk

514
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:51,278
the netherlands followed suit similarly

515
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:54,479
there's a potency cap

516
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:57,198
um where in the dutch market cannabis

517
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,800
isn't legal it's just overly tolerated

518
00:16:57,198 --> 00:17:00,240
overly is the wrong word but highly

519
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:03,439
tolerated

520
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,720
and so it's a certain thc percentage in

521
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,439
flower

522
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,160
the the dutch government officially

523
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:11,120
considers

524
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,400
cannabis worth caring about again and so

525
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:16,159
that's been

526
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:18,400
misconstrued by um

527
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,199
prohibitionists in the states is that's

528
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,798
when the

529
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,480
cannabis gets dangerous is when it's

530
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:26,000
over 15 or 16

531
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:28,318
so ridiculous it's absolutely ridiculous

532
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,038
so um if you're a medical patient don't

533
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:31,440
you need

534
00:17:29,038 --> 00:17:34,160
potent medicine if you are and i'm just

535
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,000
asking not necessarily but yeah

536
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,840
there's a lot of good reasons to have

537
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,919
potent medicine would you rather me take

538
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:42,558
if i were sick and elderly

539
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:44,000
would you rather me take 17 inhalations

540
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:46,399
off of a shitty product

541
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,400
or two dabs that's two ins and outs of

542
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,720
breathing to get the medication i need

543
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,600
we're not going to consume less we're

544
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,000
going to consume

545
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:55,119
more if it's a lesser quality product

546
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,200
we're just going to consume more

547
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:59,119
right and if they're talking about uh

548
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,558
monitoring and limiting our purchasing

549
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:01,839
even further

550
00:18:00,558 --> 00:18:03,519
we're gonna have to this is going to

551
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:04,399
drive me back to the black market is

552
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:06,639
what this will do

553
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,640
i know how much i every week i go i buy

554
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,080
my limit probably two times a week when

555
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,679
it comes to concentrates i know what day

556
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:12,720
my favorite dispensary gets a drop shout

557
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:13,360
out to you guys over there you know who

558
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,558
you are

559
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:15,918
uh i would say your name but i don't

560
00:18:14,558 --> 00:18:16,558
want more people cleaning you out on the

561
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,000
concentration

562
00:18:16,558 --> 00:18:20,160
that's why you're not getting shot

563
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,599
enough yeah yeah so i go over there and

564
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,720
i get my concentrates about twice a week

565
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:25,038
i get my limit

566
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,319
and by the time i'm ready to go back i'm

567
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:28,558
close to running out

568
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:30,000
so if they restrict my limit of

569
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:30,960
purchases that's gonna [ __ ] me up if

570
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,119
they restrict

571
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,319
the potency they would be cutting my

572
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:37,038
potency in

573
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:37,519
essentially a third uh no less than

574
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:40,640
what's

575
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:42,400
uh and that's not even the tip of why

576
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,679
this bill is bad like it'll be super

577
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,840
annoying for you and me

578
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:47,519
because we'll have to consume a much

579
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:49,918
higher volume of product

580
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:50,798
i'd be getting one-fifth of the potency

581
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:54,240
on this jar

582
00:18:50,798 --> 00:18:54,879
if it were limited to 15 but it's not

583
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,960
just

584
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,160
like what's the other eighty-five

585
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,798
percent now

586
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,759
that's why i got this no that is what

587
00:19:00,798 --> 00:19:04,240
led to

588
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:06,879
the vaping crisis last year the year

589
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:09,120
before last in 2019.

590
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,000
god 2020 still seems like five years in

591
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:13,678
my head

592
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,599
yeah um but in 2019 there was a big

593
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:18,559
vaping crisis coast to coast

594
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:21,279
and it took a while for us to really

595
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:24,319
shake out the data but once we did

596
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:28,000
we found that it's a leak or

597
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:30,240
its additives to thc in cartridges

598
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,359
and so it's shitty cartridges and shitty

599
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,319
additives

600
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:34,719
that were causing the problem and people

601
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:36,399
were

602
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,240
consuming those two things because they

603
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:41,519
wanted the thc

604
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:43,599
which doesn't harm anybody so

605
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:44,879
it's the additives that they now wanted

606
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:48,159
us to make up

607
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:50,799
85 percent of our extracts yeah

608
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:52,160
and how am i going to grow i can't grow

609
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:54,720
flowers that are 15

610
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,240
or lower i would not that's the real

611
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:59,279
reason they picked 15

612
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:02,720
is because it would gut the industry

613
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:04,798
um they know they can't vote us um away

614
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,000
and so they're hoping to to make a rule

615
00:20:04,798 --> 00:20:08,319
that it's impossible to

616
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,759
meet we the whole industry would have to

617
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:12,480
re-breed

618
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:14,240
yeah if it's not like a paint color we

619
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,640
can't be like oh there's too much blue

620
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,880
in that

621
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,159
put a little more white in and tone it

622
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,400
down like no

623
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:22,559
it's you can't spray something on it to

624
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,679
bring the thc percentage down a little

625
00:20:22,558 --> 00:20:25,038
bit

626
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,798
um you could do what they do at the

627
00:20:25,038 --> 00:20:28,000
university of mississippi and put the

628
00:20:26,798 --> 00:20:31,279
whole plant through a

629
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,640
blender and call that final product i

630
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:35,359
guess

631
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,000
um they brag about being able to provide

632
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:39,119
any

633
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,599
thc content you want yes

634
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:43,199
just they take their trash and clean it

635
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:44,480
up until it's just hash if you want them

636
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:48,400
to

637
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:51,440
um but in colorado

638
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:54,640
we've been breeding for thc

639
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:56,320
for god what

640
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,240
since what years yeah i was gonna say

641
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:59,359
since the [ __ ] 60s probably that's

642
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,720
because we didn't know about

643
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:02,399
the secondary cannabinoids we didn't

644
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,319
care we just wanted to get highs we

645
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,559
didn't have laptops one of the

646
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:08,399
one of the problems of prohibitions

647
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:09,839
aren't smoking the weed anyway i'm tired

648
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,480
of lab tests machines aren't smoking the

649
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:12,158
wheels

650
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:15,120
how's it do like we didn't know what we

651
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:17,360
had yeah i mean until

652
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:19,279
they really discovered thc and really

653
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:20,959
figured out a lot about it

654
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:22,480
it was just marijuana's fun and we're

655
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,840
not sure why yep

656
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,640
and then it was oh it's because of the

657
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:28,000
thc and we didn't get to even thinking

658
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,360
about the other stuff

659
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,759
until medical had already been in around

660
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:39,038
the country for a decade

661
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:42,798
but uh at this point to try to rebreed

662
00:21:39,038 --> 00:21:46,000
an entire genetic line across the state

663
00:21:42,798 --> 00:21:48,000
down to below 15 flour

664
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,480
it's impossible it would take two or

665
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:54,240
three years of trial and error

666
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:56,960
in cross breeding to cbd rich low thc

667
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,400
genetics and that's the point if they

668
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,200
make us take a two-year

669
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,519
non-profitable we have to completely

670
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,519
time

671
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:04,879
out we're done do you think the labs

672
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:06,240
will do us the same favor that they

673
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,919
probably do for some people

674
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:12,960
and just mark this as 12 instead of 32

675
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:14,640
probably not um i don't know the labs do

676
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,679
that everybody says those labs cheat

677
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,840
they paid the labs

678
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:19,679
dude i don't know who to pay uh i worked

679
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:20,399
with the labs i sent so much product to

680
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,600
the labs i

681
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,200
honestly look into this camera we've

682
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:24,480
never paid for a good lab test i've got

683
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,440
some of the highest lab tests in the

684
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,038
[ __ ] country

685
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,240
and we've never paid for a lab test

686
00:22:27,038 --> 00:22:29,519
wouldn't know who the [ __ ] to pay if i

687
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,640
had to they bill us for our

688
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:32,079
time and [ __ ] but i don't know who to

689
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,520
pay for a higher number so that's not a

690
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:34,798
thing you guys could say on that [ __ ]

691
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:38,158
come on

692
00:22:34,798 --> 00:22:41,679
it uh there were a couple of

693
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:44,480
labs that tried it right at the start

694
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:45,280
before we had rules because before we

695
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,558
had rules

696
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:50,798
people were asking for labs and so labs

697
00:22:48,558 --> 00:22:53,678
started to crop up and it was about

698
00:22:50,798 --> 00:22:54,000
then that the state was like wait they

699
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:56,559
have

700
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,359
what now what do you mean a lab like a

701
00:22:56,558 --> 00:22:59,359
crack house

702
00:22:57,359 --> 00:23:02,000
and it was like no like a testing lab

703
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:03,599
where a computer tells you what's in it

704
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,599
and that's when they really threw down

705
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:08,798
the first layer rules

706
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:10,000
but i think only one or two potency

707
00:23:08,798 --> 00:23:11,918
scandals like that have actually

708
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,558
happened in the country it's it's just

709
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:15,600
it's almost an urban legend not quite

710
00:23:14,558 --> 00:23:16,960
purely

711
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:18,319
people outside of the industry are the

712
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,759
ones that you hear saying they paid for

713
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:21,038
a higher test it's always those people

714
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:23,440
the people that aren't involved

715
00:23:21,038 --> 00:23:25,279
so there you go guys myth busted you

716
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,400
it's highly unlikely that anybody is

717
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:29,918
paying for a lab test

718
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,320
i've seen stores [ __ ] customers for

719
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:33,038
sure

720
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:34,319
stores can do it yeah we're on a jar

721
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:37,279
nobody's going to change it

722
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:38,639
salesman can like there's not an oath

723
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:40,639
that you think

724
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,880
where you swear on the constitution of

725
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,880
like i will do whatever the [ __ ] i have

726
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,480
to do to get tips in my tip jar that is

727
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,400
the oath it's a bud tender

728
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,480
yeah the the owner only cares what my

729
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,240
numbers my sales numbers are and my

730
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,599
sales numbers are better if i tell you

731
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,720
what you want to hear as a customer

732
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:56,639
that's just what am i going to be

733
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,159
smoking mike what's going to be in my

734
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,759
dad's what else is going to be in here

735
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:01,760
am i going to be just they

736
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:05,119
they haven't thought this out at all

737
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:07,519
they're there's no talk about

738
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:09,439
practicality or functionality at all

739
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:13,278
because the people behind it

740
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:16,240
know and want it to kill the industry

741
00:24:13,278 --> 00:24:16,798
and that everybody else is just hearing

742
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,640
the

743
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:22,639
we gotta protect the kids piece of it um

744
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,240
that's how it's built and packaged right

745
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:28,400
now and so far

746
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:31,440
there's been industry pushback but not

747
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:33,360
organized or focused

748
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,360
so this one might stick around for a

749
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:38,079
while i hope it doesn't

750
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:38,558
yeah this one it should get hammered

751
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:41,839
down

752
00:24:38,558 --> 00:24:43,839
into nothing quickly and brutally

753
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:46,959
um because it's absolute backdoor

754
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:47,839
horseshit like yeah it's detrimental to

755
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,919
the industry

756
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:55,918
okay the caller put it up to a vote

757
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:57,600
be [ __ ] voted out like if they really

758
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,320
put it on the ballot and we got voted

759
00:24:57,599 --> 00:24:59,678
out

760
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:02,798
like i'd have some serious soul

761
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:05,440
searching to do but

762
00:25:02,798 --> 00:25:06,480
this isn't that this is them trying to

763
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,919
slip uh

764
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,679
oh well you know we're just trying to

765
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:12,400
help out the kids and then no no no

766
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:13,278
like no we already make it infinitely

767
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,720
harder

768
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:17,919
to get a weed than we do like a bunch of

769
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,720
bullets

770
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:21,919
or alcohol i was going to say a bottle

771
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,440
of whiskey i can drive down the street

772
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:26,159
and get enough whiskey to kill me

773
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,679
like i could literally no other product

774
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:30,400
is limited like this

775
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:31,440
yeah there's there's nothing out there

776
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,440
that

777
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,278
i mean because recreational cannabis is

778
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,519
recreational colorado it's supposed to

779
00:25:35,278 --> 00:25:40,240
be legal just like booze

780
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:40,960
but i can go to the liquor store and buy

781
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,440
everything

782
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,960
i can pay for yeah same thing with the

783
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,919
gun store like i might have to wait a

784
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,640
while to pick up

785
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:50,480
some guns as opposed to others and i'm

786
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,000
not a big gun guy so i don't know the

787
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,839
ins and outs so like i could get the

788
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,880
pistols but not the rifles or whatever

789
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:56,720
the [ __ ]

790
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:59,200
but like i know that i could be like

791
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,798
give me all the bullets

792
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,480
and normally like right now there's a

793
00:26:00,798 --> 00:26:03,599
limit of like one or two per customer

794
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,440
everywhere because there's a shortage

795
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:09,038
but normally they'd be like

796
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:10,480
cash or charge sir i'll have the boy get

797
00:26:09,038 --> 00:26:12,319
the dolly

798
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,720
and we'll start loading your truck there

799
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:17,918
you go and

800
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:19,038
i mean same thing with farm tools or

801
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:21,520
whatever the [ __ ] you know

802
00:26:19,038 --> 00:26:23,038
yeah yeah i could i could hurt my i

803
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:24,319
could hurt myself with anything to be

804
00:26:23,038 --> 00:26:26,240
honest with you so

805
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:27,839
we've already got it limited to an ounce

806
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:30,720
per person per

807
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:32,480
per store if you want to amass a bunch i

808
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,079
guess you can go to store after store

809
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,880
after store and buy your ounce at each

810
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:38,558
store

811
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:42,400
every day but like the teenager can

812
00:26:38,558 --> 00:26:44,720
already just go to the liquor store

813
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:47,278
flash a fake id just as easily as going

814
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:49,200
to 15 20 different dispensaries

815
00:26:47,278 --> 00:26:51,599
and walk out like it's just so we've

816
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,880
already made it much harder to acquire a

817
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:54,798
shitload of cannabis

818
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,320
everybody's got a bigger burden

819
00:26:54,798 --> 00:26:58,240
everybody's got just

820
00:26:56,319 --> 00:26:59,678
window dressing the people that want

821
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,079
something find a way to

822
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:03,759
get it that's just how supply demand

823
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:06,480
desires wants that's

824
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:08,240
either legally or illegally we will get

825
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,759
what we want we're [ __ ] humans we

826
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,640
have desires we have wants and needs we

827
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:12,240
got money

828
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,919
there's a ways and means to get what we

829
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,240
want we'll [ __ ] make it happen

830
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:17,440
so we should call this the karen bill

831
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,120
because it sounds like just a bunch of

832
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,600
[ __ ] karen's trying to get all kearny

833
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:23,038
on our

834
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:25,839
[ __ ] product here the national group

835
00:27:23,038 --> 00:27:28,960
to keep an eye on is called project sam

836
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:32,158
they've been pushing the

837
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:33,360
thc is more potent or the thc in our

838
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:35,278
marijuana products is

839
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:36,558
higher than ever before it's not

840
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:38,480
grandfather's weed

841
00:27:36,558 --> 00:27:40,000
i've heard that um they've literally

842
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,640
been saying that since we were in high

843
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,960
school

844
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:44,799
it's when we were in school in the 80s

845
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,720
and 90s it was all marijuana's way

846
00:27:44,798 --> 00:27:48,158
stronger than it was in our day

847
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,919
and they've literally said that every

848
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:52,000
year well it is radical russ

849
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:54,880
added up and it might have to be like

850
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,880
two thousand percent thc to be

851
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,000
if they were right each time it's a

852
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,200
little bit stronger

853
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,798
it's a little bit stronger every year

854
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,000
and that's partly i am pushing that we

855
00:28:00,798 --> 00:28:03,038
are there's a lot of us out there shout

856
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,240
out to my breeder friends who are out

857
00:28:03,038 --> 00:28:05,200
there trying to push the limits on that

858
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,679
thc

859
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,200
don't [ __ ] stop don't stop hiring

860
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:13,440
never stop more potency

861
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:15,440
also more terps get the terms

862
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,640
the only place they've been successful

863
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,679
with a constant

864
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:21,759
potency cap is in vermont

865
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:24,240
right now vermont has a potency cap of

866
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:25,919
60 for concentrates

867
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,839
apparently washington state is

868
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:32,240
considering similar legislation

869
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:32,879
um the anti-pot groups have figured out

870
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,919
that

871
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,480
don't do it isn't a winning message and

872
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:39,840
so they're

873
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:42,038
shifted to a couple of similar

874
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:43,678
toned down messages like just go with

875
00:28:42,038 --> 00:28:46,879
decriminalization

876
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:48,640
somehow decrim is better denver was

877
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,559
decrim when i was a teenager it wasn't

878
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:53,440
[ __ ] better i promise you

879
00:28:50,558 --> 00:28:53,759
right um i still take the same thing

880
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,558
with

881
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:58,158
uh cannabis is more potent potent now

882
00:28:56,558 --> 00:29:01,200
than ever before

883
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:02,960
um there's a couple others uh

884
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,558
big alcohol and big tobacco are going to

885
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,480
take it over which i

886
00:29:04,558 --> 00:29:08,319
chuckle like if either one of those com

887
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:11,599
industries got into marijuana they'd be

888
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:13,359
selling a much safer product to humanity

889
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:15,359
and like i don't like marlboro i gave

890
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:17,199
them way too much money for way too long

891
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:18,959
but if they started selling weed like

892
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,960
they're switching to a company or

893
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,240
a product that kills zero people a year

894
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,720
versus one that kills four hundred

895
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,440
thousand

896
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:27,038
like that's a net win for humanity but

897
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,519
they think it's a winning argument to be

898
00:29:27,038 --> 00:29:31,599
like they might get into it too

899
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:33,200
let's bring them on i've never said that

900
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:34,798
yeah we uh

901
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,880
all the people like me have been busy

902
00:29:34,798 --> 00:29:38,879
working for the last couple years

903
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,720
like we haven't been fighting the good

904
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,080
fight anymore and so the

905
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:44,720
the people on the other side are

906
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:46,319
starting to gain some traction again so

907
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,640
everybody needs to buck up and i think i

908
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:49,759
said it a bunch last time i was on but

909
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,759
find out who your elected

910
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:54,000
representatives are it's a one quick

911
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:57,038
internet search away and email them as

912
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,558
often as you can get it legal where you

913
00:29:57,038 --> 00:30:00,319
are if it's not

914
00:29:58,558 --> 00:30:02,398
if it's legal where you are the rules

915
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:04,000
can be better

916
00:30:02,398 --> 00:30:06,239
this is a colorado issue here mike so

917
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,759
who do they contact here in colorado to

918
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,839
try to prevent this sort of all of your

919
00:30:07,759 --> 00:30:11,519
elected reps um so just

920
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:12,879
if you're in colorado doesn't matter

921
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:15,839
where you are say who's my

922
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,559
state representative for whatever your

923
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:20,398
area is

924
00:30:16,558 --> 00:30:22,798
aurora denver thornton pueblo springs

925
00:30:20,398 --> 00:30:24,000
the names will come up send them an

926
00:30:22,798 --> 00:30:25,839
email um

927
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,440
down here in pueblo you're looking at

928
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:31,038
leroy garcia

929
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:36,320
um danaya eskar i think

930
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:39,599
that sounds right since i checked um

931
00:30:36,319 --> 00:30:41,278
i know bobert's our national rep

932
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:44,398
um she's not gonna be super helpful with

933
00:30:41,278 --> 00:30:48,000
federal legalization but y'all can try

934
00:30:44,398 --> 00:30:50,000
um no comment yeah we could do in like

935
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,079
another two hours on what's happening

936
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,119
nationally and federally because there

937
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:56,158
is

938
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:58,879
something like 850 marijuana bills

939
00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:01,440
in states in congress right now so

940
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:05,120
there's a lot of movement everywhere

941
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:06,720
um there's uh

942
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:08,079
there's a dude from nebraska i don't

943
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,480
know if he was the attorney general or

944
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:11,199
the

945
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:13,919
the governor saying that if you legalize

946
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:16,960
marijuana it's killing your kids

947
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:18,240
and like he was serious when he said

948
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,798
that into a microphone

949
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:22,640
staring at a camera and he's getting

950
00:31:20,798 --> 00:31:25,759
eaten alive on the internet for it

951
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:26,960
but uh there's a whole different faction

952
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:28,558
that's just eating it up and they're

953
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:31,600
like yeah he's right

954
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:33,918
it is and then they throw out nonsense

955
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:37,519
like traffic accidents or

956
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:39,440
schizophrenia i think a lot of our age

957
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:41,359
like our generation the older people

958
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,440
that were programmed with the reefer

959
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:46,240
madness with all the hysteria

960
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,720
unfortunately slash they're passing

961
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,480
they're

962
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,600
disappearing they're covets [ __ ]

963
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,480
wiping them out they're getting old

964
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:52,639
they're retiring they're

965
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,079
going away the younger generations are

966
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,759
all about let me do whatever the [ __ ] i

967
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:57,359
want generation dreadlocks

968
00:31:55,759 --> 00:31:59,359
uh the generation what do they call them

969
00:31:57,359 --> 00:32:01,278
the millennials a lot of us are

970
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:02,719
them us we're just like let us do what

971
00:32:01,278 --> 00:32:03,679
we want so pretty soon a lot of the

972
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,319
silly

973
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:07,038
control stuff is going to go away i say

974
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:09,759
that that's the

975
00:32:07,038 --> 00:32:11,278
hope but they've been saying that since

976
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:12,558
they're taking away words and feelings

977
00:32:11,278 --> 00:32:14,319
now so we're not allowed to have certain

978
00:32:12,558 --> 00:32:15,839
words and feelings so i don't know where

979
00:32:14,319 --> 00:32:16,558
the future is going mike i really

980
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:18,079
thought i had a

981
00:32:16,558 --> 00:32:20,000
plan and some hope for the future until

982
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:22,240
i fought deeper into it and

983
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,038
they took away words from us so i don't

984
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,038
know it's different now

985
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:29,678
did i just kill the whole show we can go

986
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,200
there but

987
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:32,798
no i don't think the listeners are going

988
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:36,080
to like my views on

989
00:32:32,798 --> 00:32:38,000
this stuff um so if they do limit the

990
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:38,798
potency levels on flowers and

991
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,319
concentrates

992
00:32:38,798 --> 00:32:42,079
the entire industry will have to

993
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:44,480
redesign their entire

994
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:45,359
sops their production facilities their

995
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,558
equipment

996
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:50,479
everything will be different um way

997
00:32:48,558 --> 00:32:53,038
worse than that because you can't change

998
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:55,759
potency with an ssop

999
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:56,640
i mean i can't i can't throw less calmag

1000
00:32:55,759 --> 00:33:00,720
in the bucket

1001
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:04,799
and have the potency go from 31 to 18.

1002
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:05,759
um and with concentrates they just do

1003
00:33:04,798 --> 00:33:09,440
what they're doing now

1004
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:12,480
and then add 85 [ __ ]

1005
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:14,798
i don't know why anyone would want it's

1006
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:16,319
that's the point it's designed to

1007
00:33:14,798 --> 00:33:19,599
destroy the industry

1008
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:23,038
and it's not even

1009
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:26,079
cloaked or veiled at all

1010
00:33:23,038 --> 00:33:26,480
that or other than the thinnest garnish

1011
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:29,119
of

1012
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:31,038
think of the children nonsense it's

1013
00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:32,798
really really really ugly and the fact

1014
00:33:31,038 --> 00:33:34,000
that this is gaining traction drives me

1015
00:33:32,798 --> 00:33:35,839
[ __ ] nuts

1016
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,359
because the whole argument for it is

1017
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:40,558
nonsense

1018
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:42,639
um the potency thing

1019
00:33:40,558 --> 00:33:45,038
it's not more potent than it was before

1020
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:48,960
we've always had concentrates

1021
00:33:45,038 --> 00:33:52,000
with butane extracts and stuff we've

1022
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:55,120
purified it recreationally but that's

1023
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,079
what marinol is right they already did

1024
00:33:55,119 --> 00:34:01,038
that

1025
00:33:56,079 --> 00:34:03,119
it's not new or special it's just

1026
00:34:01,038 --> 00:34:04,839
advertised more so that everybody knows

1027
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:08,000
about it now

1028
00:34:04,839 --> 00:34:09,679
um it's that there's a logical fallacy i

1029
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,679
forget the name of it but it's when you

1030
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:14,878
see something for the first time

1031
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:17,280
your brain goes oh reggae must be new

1032
00:34:14,878 --> 00:34:18,639
i've never heard it before and then

1033
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:21,760
somebody that's

1034
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:23,200
not clueless about reggae it was oh bro

1035
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,440
right there's a whole section in the

1036
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:26,960
music store how have you never seen this

1037
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,838
and that's the same thing with hash when

1038
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:32,320
you're like well yeah i know that wax

1039
00:34:29,838 --> 00:34:34,239
and shatter look scary and the dab rigs

1040
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:37,838
look kind of scary but

1041
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:39,918
do you know about black tar hash and the

1042
00:34:37,838 --> 00:34:41,679
hot knife hits cause

1043
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:43,358
not any less scary and they're like oh

1044
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:44,878
my god what was that

1045
00:34:43,358 --> 00:34:46,719
and you start explaining some of this

1046
00:34:44,878 --> 00:34:48,480
stuff and their jaw drops

1047
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:50,078
and then there's there's inevitably one

1048
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,280
old guy in the group that's giggling and

1049
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:53,440
it's like you're the [ __ ] one that

1050
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:55,599
went to parties

1051
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:58,000
because everybody in the generation

1052
00:34:55,599 --> 00:35:00,240
above us knows about hot knife hits

1053
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,000
or a little piece of hash on a pin in a

1054
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:04,719
matchbook under a beer glass

1055
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,239
with a straw like before dab rigs they

1056
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:09,199
had a bunch of stupid ways of

1057
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:10,959
just lose so many young listeners minds

1058
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:11,519
like what's he [ __ ] talking about you

1059
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,720
guys go

1060
00:35:11,519 --> 00:35:15,679
go think about old stories videos old

1061
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:17,598
knife hits

1062
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:19,598
i used to put the hash on a pin with

1063
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:21,680
some heat under it somehow

1064
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:23,039
um if i can put a cup over it so when

1065
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:24,480
the hash burns you catch all the smoke

1066
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:25,759
in a cup and lift it up and suck the

1067
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,079
smoke out of the cup

1068
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,200
we just have to do weird [ __ ] everybody

1069
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:31,200
there

1070
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:33,439
take two butter knives and set them on

1071
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:36,719
the stove until the ends glow

1072
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:38,400
and instead of blow torching a banger

1073
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:39,919
you're just heating up two knives and

1074
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:42,720
then you'd have a

1075
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:44,079
glass or a plastic straw you'd mash a

1076
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:47,439
piece of hash between the two

1077
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:48,960
knives and freebase it because there's

1078
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:52,720
no other way to say it

1079
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:54,559
yeah hash pipes like weezer had that

1080
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:56,078
song back in 2001

1081
00:35:54,559 --> 00:35:58,480
but only people who traveled

1082
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:59,760
internationally or were really into

1083
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:02,159
cannabis knew what the [ __ ] they were

1084
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:04,800
talking about

1085
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:06,960
yeah but it's not like it's not new it's

1086
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:09,359
just redressed

1087
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:11,679
is is modern hash and it's allowing

1088
00:36:09,358 --> 00:36:14,078
people to replay fear cards that they

1089
00:36:11,679 --> 00:36:17,039
haven't been able to play in 20 years

1090
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:17,359
it drives me nuts yeah uh we were at any

1091
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:19,759
point

1092
00:36:17,358 --> 00:36:21,519
into it we were at an event and back in

1093
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:24,960
the day they would sell us

1094
00:36:21,519 --> 00:36:26,880
uh co2 concentrate oil like uh

1095
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,240
it's dab oil you could dab it you could

1096
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,880
smoke it uh

1097
00:36:28,239 --> 00:36:32,159
but it would come in a syringe not like

1098
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,920
with a needle on it

1099
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:35,679
but that's how they would measure it out

1100
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,440
and suck frosting kind of

1101
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:39,039
yeah it's it's an oral syringe is

1102
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,960
actually what it is you can

1103
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:42,639
yeah yes that you could feed a kitten or

1104
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,920
something out of this little syringe

1105
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:45,118
you just put in the kitten's mouth and

1106
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,320
shove the medicine down the kitten's

1107
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:47,280
throat instead of having to get it to

1108
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,559
eat something or something like that

1109
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:51,519
that's what i used it for

1110
00:36:48,559 --> 00:36:52,960
but the owner of this place saw the

1111
00:36:51,519 --> 00:36:54,320
syringe and he tried to make us all

1112
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,880
leave like you guys have to get out of

1113
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,720
here

1114
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,960
i was like bro that that's weed in there

1115
00:36:56,719 --> 00:37:01,439
and he did not believe us i had to

1116
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:03,119
sit down and educate him because he saw

1117
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:06,079
what looked like a syringe

1118
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:07,039
and completely there was no talking no

1119
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:09,200
[ __ ]

1120
00:37:07,039 --> 00:37:10,159
it was just over and i had to every now

1121
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:12,078
and then

1122
00:37:10,159 --> 00:37:13,759
the syringes you'll see are popular in

1123
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:14,960
the dispensaries because you can refill

1124
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,880
cartridges with them

1125
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:18,159
yeah and so instead of throwing your

1126
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,838
card out when it's

1127
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:21,598
it goes empty for the first time because

1128
00:37:19,838 --> 00:37:24,320
the carts not toast

1129
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:25,680
you can save a few bucks by refilling it

1130
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:29,039
and every now and then

1131
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:32,000
some anti-pop mom will get on facebook

1132
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:34,400
and share a couple of cell phone photos

1133
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,800
she's snapped inside a dispensary

1134
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:38,320
or a screen grab off a dispensary menu

1135
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:41,280
on the online

1136
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:42,480
and it'll include a refill syringe and

1137
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,960
then for the next

1138
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:46,880
two three months as i watch this photo

1139
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:48,960
gets bounced around the echo chamber

1140
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:52,160
that is the anti-power world

1141
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:54,079
um that

1142
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:56,399
they get so fired up but oh my god

1143
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:58,800
they're injecting thc now and

1144
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,480
i heard it causes instant schizophrenia

1145
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:03,119
and

1146
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:04,000
they're injected 100 pure thc and it's

1147
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:06,720
it's doing crazy

1148
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,119
things to these teenagers yeah and it's

1149
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:11,519
like

1150
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:12,960
it's a plastic there's no needle

1151
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:15,199
no needle no needle on there you guys

1152
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,800
we're not shooting up thc those syringes

1153
00:38:15,199 --> 00:38:18,480
like a little thing of decorative

1154
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,200
frosting like yeah a lot of times you've

1155
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,880
done that

1156
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:22,480
oil that's rso you scored out just a

1157
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:24,240
little like a pea size or a piece of

1158
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,679
rice onto your finger and eat it

1159
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:27,199
and you just put in the syringe because

1160
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:27,838
it's easier to push it out and dose it

1161
00:38:27,199 --> 00:38:29,439

1165
00:38:34,159 --> 00:38:37,279
backpack to fill up my dab rig

1166

bottle of water away and i was like

1173

we're not coming back here don't worry

1174
00:38:49,039 --> 00:38:54,079
that's why we need

1175
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:58,400
real cannabis spaces yes so bad

1176
00:38:54,079 --> 00:39:01,039
and man if your state isn't legal yet

1177
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:01,680
you gotta be writing everyone in office

1178
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:04,239
right now

1179
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:06,480
saying here's a way for us to make

1180
00:39:04,239 --> 00:39:08,399
millions and millions of dollars

1181
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:10,159
and all the information is online right

1182
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,440
now you can put together a hell of an

1183
00:39:10,159 --> 00:39:15,279
argument in like an

1184
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:16,000
hour um email me if you need more

1185
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,160
information

1186
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,039
send me a message on social media mike

1187
00:39:18,159 --> 00:39:20,639
write up

1188
00:39:19,039 --> 00:39:22,320
add a template that people can copy and

1189
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:24,879
paste um

1190
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:27,440
it's so easy it's so so easy just go put

1191
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:32,960
it on your facebook just hit

1192
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:36,000
what'd we hit 10 billion in tax revenue

1193
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:38,400
it might have been 1 billion a billion

1194
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:41,440
[ __ ] load we just hit another major

1195
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,800
milestone um

1196
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:46,320
why are all the roads still all [ __ ]

1197
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,320
up look if we get a billion dollars

1198
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:51,759
like a wreck so

1199
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,119
the people ask that about the roads and

1200
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,000
the schools all the time and it's just

1201
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:56,160
because

1202
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,838
roads cost more than you think roads

1203
00:39:56,159 --> 00:40:01,118
cost

1204
00:39:57,838 --> 00:40:03,599
um like colorado rakes in it

1205
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:05,200
and what seems like an amazing amount of

1206
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:09,838
marijuana tax revenue

1207
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:12,000
and i'm not saying it's not helpful

1208
00:40:09,838 --> 00:40:12,960
the anti-pop people work very hard to

1209
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,000
make this

1210
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:17,679
this fact seem shocking but our pot

1211
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,599
revenue is about one percent of our

1212
00:40:17,679 --> 00:40:22,318
state budget

1213
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:24,160
um which i mean one percent doesn't

1214
00:40:22,318 --> 00:40:26,960
sound like a lot but the number's huge

1215
00:40:24,159 --> 00:40:29,039
like it's colorado spends a lot of money

1216
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:31,358
every year so does your state

1217
00:40:29,039 --> 00:40:33,759
um but one percent is super helpful

1218
00:40:31,358 --> 00:40:36,960
we're one percent less [ __ ]

1219
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:38,560
um everything's one percent better

1220
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:40,800
financially in colorado because of our

1221
00:40:38,559 --> 00:40:43,358
cannabis industry and for the most part

1222
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:45,519
that's business that's already happening

1223
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:47,279
um everybody i know that smokes weed

1224
00:40:45,519 --> 00:40:48,079
smoked weed before it was legal to smoke

1225
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,599
weed

1226
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:52,318
and that includes the people that have

1227
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:53,838
become legal since legalization they all

1228
00:40:52,318 --> 00:40:57,119
smoked illegal weed before

1229
00:40:53,838 --> 00:40:58,480
they were legal that's just how it goes

1230
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:00,000
sounds like we might be going back to

1231
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,358
smoking more illegal weed if they start

1232
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,880
[ __ ] with my concentrates mike i'm

1233
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:05,759
not gonna smoke 15

1234
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:06,000
dabs i'll be pouring the entire ram into

1235
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,960
my

1236
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,358
[ __ ] into the banger just every time

1237
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,440
yeah

1238
00:41:09,358 --> 00:41:13,119
or trying to figure out how that that'll

1239
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:16,240
be the immediate

1240
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:17,599
response by people like us is down at

1241
00:41:16,239 --> 00:41:18,879
the head shop there will be a new

1242
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:22,480
product

1243
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:25,838
where you use solution a and tab b

1244
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:29,039
to turn your 85 crap hash

1245
00:41:25,838 --> 00:41:31,599
back into 90 good hash yep

1246
00:41:29,039 --> 00:41:32,239
that's just how it'll be well they fixed

1247
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:35,359
the price

1248
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:37,279
if i'm getting one-fifth of my thc

1249
00:41:35,358 --> 00:41:39,279
do i get one-fifth of the price do i get

1250
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:43,920
four you gotta pay for that filler

1251
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:47,119
no yep this is that

1252
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:48,880
it's it's fully not functional and it's

1253
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:52,000
it's how i know that there's no good

1254
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:53,920
faith if there was good faith here

1255
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,159
they would have at least a couple of

1256
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:59,119
people who understand how the cannabis

1257
00:41:56,159 --> 00:42:00,639
industry works and how we got here that

1258
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:04,559
would have talked them out of

1259
00:42:00,639 --> 00:42:06,239
ever attempting this bill and it's

1260
00:42:04,559 --> 00:42:08,318
if your goal is really to protect the

1261
00:42:06,239 --> 00:42:11,679
kids there's a million ways

1262
00:42:08,318 --> 00:42:13,599
that we can protect kids like it used to

1263
00:42:11,679 --> 00:42:14,879
be my profession it's my wife's

1264
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:17,838
profession

1265
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:18,800
i know a lot of people whose job could

1266
00:42:17,838 --> 00:42:20,400
be

1267
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:22,560
briefly or lightly described as

1268
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:24,160
protecting kids and they could all use

1269
00:42:22,559 --> 00:42:24,480
[ __ ] more money and more funding and

1270
00:42:24,159 --> 00:42:27,440
more

1271
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:29,119
resources and more people but this isn't

1272
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:31,039
it this is a kill the marijuana

1273
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:33,200
bill yeah kill the marijuana industry

1274
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:35,358
bill plain and simple

1275
00:42:33,199 --> 00:42:36,399
it's not karen's responsibility to make

1276
00:42:35,358 --> 00:42:38,239
sure my daughter

1277
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:40,000
doesn't get high potency concentrates

1278
00:42:38,239 --> 00:42:42,078
it's my responsibility i'm the one that

1279
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,838
bought it at the dispensary i've got the

1280
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:45,200
money the adult id though i was gonna

1281
00:42:43,838 --> 00:42:46,480
say the medical marijuana card but

1282
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:48,239
that's not even necessary

1283
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:50,240
i've got all the credentials i bought it

1284
00:42:48,239 --> 00:42:52,078
it's in my house where my daughter is

1285
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:53,919
it's my responsibility

1286
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:55,519
to make sure she doesn't get it so it's

1287
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:58,240
not karen's responsibility

1288
00:42:55,519 --> 00:42:59,119
so karen stay the [ __ ] out of it we got

1289
00:42:58,239 --> 00:43:01,598
this under control

1290
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:03,440
when it's it's not even neck you feel

1291
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:07,039
like the world is full of stuff

1292
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:08,480
that potency matters like i've got three

1293
00:43:07,039 --> 00:43:09,759
different strengths of town on my

1294
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:12,318
[ __ ] cabinet

1295
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:14,000
i can take like eight of the little ones

1296
00:43:12,318 --> 00:43:16,239
but if i take eight of the big ones it's

1297
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:19,838
gonna be my last [ __ ] headache

1298
00:43:16,239 --> 00:43:21,679
um same thing with the vodka if

1299
00:43:19,838 --> 00:43:23,119
i screw up and drink the vodka like it's

1300
00:43:21,679 --> 00:43:24,879
corona

1301
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:27,039
really bad things are gonna happen in my

1302
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:29,440
world that aren't at all

1303
00:43:27,039 --> 00:43:31,679
intended or suggested by the

1304
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:33,679
manufacturer

1305
00:43:31,679 --> 00:43:34,799
just because potent hash exists doesn't

1306
00:43:33,679 --> 00:43:36,239
necessarily mean

1307
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,839
mean it's a problem it just means

1308
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:40,399
there's nuance here that

1309
00:43:37,838 --> 00:43:42,480
middle american never noticed you don't

1310
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:46,160

1325
00:44:09,039 --> 00:44:12,400
anti-pop crowd because they're granting

1326

1327
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:16,000
