let's work our way into the question and

35
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,079
answer portion of the show lately

36
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,079
Autoflower seeds have been a big topic

37
00:01:31,078 --> 00:01:34,839
online on social media in the grow

38
00:01:33,078 --> 00:01:36,759
Community I've been getting a lot of

39
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:38,880
questions about autof flowers I've

40
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:41,040
actually been getting a lot of requests

41
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:42,759
for autoflowers that's right people are

42
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,360
asking me to breed make and sell

43
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:47,239
Autoflower seeds uh people have asked me

44
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:50,280
why I don't do that and today we are

45
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:52,039
going to briefly address why I don't I

46
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,159
don't [ __ ] with autoflowers it is that

47
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:56,000
simple we'll talk about why before we do

48
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,439
that let's talk about what are autof

49
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,680
flowers um all of the seeds that I make

50
00:01:58,438 --> 00:02:03,239
every seed you buy from I genetics

51
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:05,799
whether it's a femin seed or a regular

52
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:08,118
seed all of those seeds will be photo

53
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:10,000
period seeds which means they flower

54
00:02:08,118 --> 00:02:12,080
based on the amount of light hours which

55
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,639
they are given those seeds are going to

56
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,200
need 12 hours of uninterrupted Darkness

57
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:19,559
per day to initiate the flowering cycle

58
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:21,439
that is a photo period plant the absence

59
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,959
of light the short day that is what

60
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:24,680
tells that plant hey it is time for me

61
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,800
to flower that will initiate the

62
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:29,120
flowering phase those are the plants

63
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,640
that I make and I enjoy growing uh those

64
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,400
are the plants I appreciate I personally

65
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:37,639
do not enjoy uh growing or smoking

66
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,840
autoflow plants I'm not a hater um I'm

67
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:41,839
not just trying to bash these plants uh

68
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,598
I prefer a plant that I can veg the

69
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,239
amount of time that I want to veg that

70
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:48,158
plant I can pop it twist it defoliate it

71
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,840
lollipop it um I can do all the

72
00:02:48,158 --> 00:02:51,799
manipulation that I need to it to fill

73
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,920
my canopy and grow the room to the

74
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:56,959
quality and uh quantity that I need with

75
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:58,318
an Autoflower plant I don't have that

76
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,519
option those plants are just going to

77
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:02,359
flower when they are ready I can't top

78
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:04,319
it I can't do as much manipulation

79
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:06,840
because it may stress that plant so the

80
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:08,280
autoflowers can't be topped uh you can't

81
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,479
dictate the amount of vegge time they

82
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,158
are going to flower when they are ready

83
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:14,518
uh so I don't prefer the Autoflower

84
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:16,039
plants uh mainly because I like the

85
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:17,599
first thing I like is the control I like

86
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:19,878
to be able to top the plant spread it

87
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:22,039
out veget as long as I need to fill my

88
00:03:19,878 --> 00:03:24,158
space and flour when I'm ready autoflow

89
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:26,318
I cannot do that the other aspect of an

90
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:28,639
autoflow which I don't appreciate is if

91
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:31,079
I were to grow the most amazing fire

92
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:33,000
most potent tastiest trippiest best

93
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:35,120
[ __ ] plant I have ever grown with an

94
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,400
autof flower that's a one-time deal I

95
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,039
don't get to grow that again because

96
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,719
it's an auto I did not take clone I did

97
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:43,120
not take a clone because you cannot take

98
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:45,479
clones from an autoflowering plant that

99
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,920
clone will be the same age as the rest

100
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:48,719
of the plant so let's say you've got a

101
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:50,479
plant and this is a concept that counts

102
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:52,519
to all plants but just think about this

103
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:54,759
as autof flowers you've got a mother

104
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:57,280
plant you take a clone from it that

105
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:59,399
clone is technically the same age as the

106
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,878
plant which that clone came from if it

107
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,599
came from a photo period or an

108
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:05,560
Autoflower that clone is the age of the

109
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:07,199
plant that it derived from so if your

110
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:09,079
plant's been growing for 6 months those

111
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:11,280
hormones are moved around in the plant

112
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:13,439
that clone is also 6 months old even if

113
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,239
you just cut it today so when you cut

114
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:17,399
that Autoflower clone those hormones

115
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:19,639
within that clone have already told that

116
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:21,519
plant it is almost time to go into flow

117
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:23,360
and it will go into flow before it roots

118
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,160
or very shortly after and you'll have a

119
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,000
little tiny Autoflower clone that just

120
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:29,360
flowered on you you won't even get to

121
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,240
keep it so the main aspect is I like the

122
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,520
control contr maybe I'm a control freak

123
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:36,000
maybe I've got some OCD but I like to be

124
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:37,959
able to veg as long as I need to veg to

125
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,519
fill that grow space I also like to be

126
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:41,918
able to take a clone for repeatable

127
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:43,799
results so I said we were going to talk

128
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:45,279
about what an autoflow is I segwayed

129
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,840
right on into telling you why I don't

130
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:49,679
make them I don't like that I cannot veg

131
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:51,918
them as long as I want I cannot fill my

132
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,439
canopy I cannot fill the trellis I can't

133
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:55,279
fill the whole tent and I need to fill

134
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:56,918
the whole Space if I'm growing what's

135
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:59,119
the point in just filling a portion of

136
00:04:56,918 --> 00:05:01,038
my grow space I want to fill it up I'm

137
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,600
using the I'm using the energy let's use

138
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:06,639
the space and fill it up um I kind of

139
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,479
use the analogy of I am not a country

140
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,800
music fan if you like country music

141
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:12,319
enjoy it I'm not talking [ __ ] I'm

142
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:14,079
telling you what I enjoy um I am not a

143
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:15,719
big fan of country music I know what it

144
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:17,758
sounds like I can play it on the drums

145
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:20,639
I've heard it but I'm not a big country

146
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:22,600
music fan I am a ree fan I love ree

147
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:25,120
music I love Jamrock music I love rock

148
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:27,520
and roll type music um if you put me on

149
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,759
the drums and you said let's play ree

150
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:32,478
that [ __ ] is gonna sound good because

151
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,919
I've got Reay feel I enjoy Reay I

152
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:36,918
understand Reay I've uh researched and

153
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:38,839
understood and felt the feeling of Reay

154
00:05:36,918 --> 00:05:40,560
drums I know how to do that you would

155
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:43,079
think it's a Raye drummer playing on

156
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,759
that track if you had me play country

157
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:47,639
music it would sound good but it

158
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:51,000
wouldn't sound like it could If you

159
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:53,160
hired a Nashville uh Tennessee type of

160
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
country drummer a session Studio country

161
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:57,120
guy to come in and do that it would be

162
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,120
much it would be much better because he

163
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:02,560
feels country he understands that Nuance

164
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:04,600
of country music he's in that [ __ ] I'm

165
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,759
not in Autoflower I don't enjoy it I

166
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:08,720
don't like growing it uh to the best of

167
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:10,919
my knowledge I don't like smoking it

168
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,720
however now everything is concentrates

169
00:06:10,918 --> 00:06:15,598
you could possibly possibly give me some

170
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:17,120
concentrates made from autoflowers and I

171
00:06:15,598 --> 00:06:19,199
wouldn't know the difference because

172
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,680
it's concentrates it's not Autos I may

173
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,560
enjoy that I wouldn't know the

174
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:24,519
difference right now it may be happening

175
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,959
I don't even know so to the best of my

176
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:29,598
knowledge I don't enjoy smoking or

177
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:30,959
growing Autoflower plants which means I

178
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:33,159
would not enjoy breeding them because

179
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:35,159
there's no passion there uh when I think

180
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:37,120
about breeding plants it's usually I'm

181
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,800
in a grow and I see a plant and I love

182
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,759
the way that it grows and I see it a few

183
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,199
times I watch it develop and I go that

184
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:44,680
plant right there that's got something

185
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:46,720
to it or I smell a jar or I smoke

186
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:48,680
something or something about one plant

187
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,840
or two plants just tells me some Bells

188
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:52,319
some buzzers go off with Autoflower

189
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:54,359
plants I don't get those buzzers there's

190
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,240
no there's no passion for the Autoflower

191
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,000
they just don't they simply do not get

192
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,319
my attention it's just not attractive to

193
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,680
me so to compare that to music to Loop

194
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:05,080
that back around to music uh that would

195
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:06,598
be like me just playing country music I

196
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:08,758
could do it but there would be no

197
00:07:06,598 --> 00:07:10,279
passion there would be no feel uh we'll

198
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:12,080
leave the playing the country music to

199
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:14,359
people who enjoy the country music it'll

200
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:16,159
sound good it'll come out better that's

201
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,879
exactly how I feel about the autoflow

202
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,319
plants we'll let people with more

203
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:21,479
passion uh grow those autoflow plants

204
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,919
breed those there are plenty of people

205
00:07:21,478 --> 00:07:24,918
out there doing it shout out to my buddy

206
00:07:22,918 --> 00:07:28,399
Daz killing it with the Autoflower

207
00:07:24,918 --> 00:07:30,279
plants um also my company uh the Company

208
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:32,159
motto is grow from your heart and breed

209
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:33,918
with love um if I were breeding

210
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,199
Autoflower plants it would it would not

211
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:38,000
be love I appreciate that you guys want

212
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:40,000
them but I'm not in love so it would

213
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,598
just be just PA and chucking it would it

214
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,038
would just be honestly it' be a money

215
00:07:41,598 --> 00:07:45,158
grab and that's not what this is about

216
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:46,959
this has never been a money grab for me

217
00:07:45,158 --> 00:07:48,560
this is always been growing from my

218
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:51,079
heart and breeding with love which is

219
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,918
what I do and I think that's a lot of

220
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:55,719
why I am successful that's a lot of why

221
00:07:53,918 --> 00:07:58,478
uh why your favorite musician is

222
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:00,240
successful is because uh they put music

223
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,598
out that they loved the the music came

224
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,079
from their heart it came from their soul

225
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:05,158
it took them a long time to make that

226
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:07,079
music they put it out and it's [ __ ]

227
00:08:05,158 --> 00:08:09,158
good because they did what they love

228
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:10,918
they weren't worried about will you like

229
00:08:09,158 --> 00:08:12,800
it we hope you guys like our product but

230
00:08:10,918 --> 00:08:14,478
if you don't that's fine as long as I

231
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,598
love my breeding project that's really

232
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:18,598
what matters as long as a musician loves

233
00:08:16,598 --> 00:08:20,560
the album that they put out that's

234
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:21,918
really what matters but when you do

235
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,120
something with passion like that and

236
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:26,839
you're not worried about marketability

237
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:28,360
finances sales numbers charts when you

238
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:29,758
do something from your heart from your

239
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,598
soul and this could be anything be

240
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,240
cooking it could be sewing whatever

241
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:35,879
you're into whatever craft you're doing

242
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:38,000
from your heart that will show and the

243
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:40,158
clientele is there if you do it from

244
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,839
your heart don't do it for clientele the

245
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:44,319
clientele will buy your passion if you

246
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:46,080
do it with passion uh if it's painting

247
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,320
drawing stitching whatever or whatever

248
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,839
you do um there's a million different

249
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,879
Arts out there and I encourage everybody

250
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:53,640
to find your Niche but if you do it with

251
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:56,039
passion if you do it with love and you

252
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:57,559
don't adjust that art for the market you

253
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:59,000
will find your audience the audience

254
00:08:57,559 --> 00:09:00,958
will see that and you'll put out a

255
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,278
better prodct product uh if I were to

256
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:05,479
adjust my breeding uh adjust my music

257
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:06,720
for the audience it would suck um I

258
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:09,159
don't want to make commercially

259
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,399
acceptable products or music uh that's

260
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:14,480
not what I'm trying to do um so let's

261
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:16,320
talk about now how uh client or artist

262
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,440
or crowd influence comes into play with

263
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,640
this let's talk about your favorite

264
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,440
musician uh remember that first album

265
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:23,559
they made it was pretty good that second

266
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,959
album it was good the third one it

267
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:27,599
sucked because they weren't struggling

268
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:29,039
anymore uh they weren't struggling

269
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,320
musicians they weren't sleeping on the

270
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:32,399
couch they weren't living in the tour

271
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,760
van uh they were being handed a bunch of

272
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,879
money and then they were forced to make

273
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:37,439
a product on a deadline and that wasn't

274
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:39,120
done with passion they didn't record

275
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,800
from their heart uh they recorded

276
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,200
because the [ __ ] record company has a

277
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:44,240
deadline and we got to make this money

278
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:46,600
and get these songs out and you can tell

279
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,680
by that third that fourth album All That

280
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:50,200
passion went away because they forgot

281
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:51,719
they're they're not growing from their

282
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,640
heart they're not breeding with love

283
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,839
they're making autof flowers to fill a

284
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:56,600
contract and that's not what I'm trying

285
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:58,320
to do that's not what I'm here for uh

286
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,839
that's never what this was about I

287
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,399
started off

288
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,760
uh I started off as a consumer I was a

289
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:05,600
smoker um and then I started growing and

290
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:08,000
then I got into the medical marijuana

291
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,920
field and when I saw what I was doing

292
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,919
for medical marijuana patients and

293
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:14,439
clients it changed my outlook on this um

294
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:15,958
I used to sell black market cannabis

295
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,880
that was how I survived but once I got

296
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:21,199
into the medical field uh the medical

297
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:23,519
marijuana side of things and I saw how a

298
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,240
product that I took my time to cultivate

299
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,159
I grew these plants I grew them I

300
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:28,759
harvested them trimmed them dried them

301
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:30,838
and cured them and then I had people

302
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:32,240
come to my dispensary and they would be

303
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,880
brand new there would be little old

304
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,360
ladies that have never smoked weed would

305
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:37,439
come to this dispensary looking for

306
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,320
Relief and they wouldn't have any clue

307
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,240
what to do so I'd give them three or

308
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:43,800
four different kinds of bud just say

309
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:45,480
here's an Indica here's a sativa here's

310
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:47,559
a hybrid and then here's just something

311
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:49,639
else just to try and I would give them a

312
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:51,039
gram of each or pre-roll of each and I

313
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:53,320
would label it and I would tell them go

314
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:54,879
home and smoke these on a different day

315
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:57,200
and figure out what works the best for

316
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:58,519
you take a couple of rips find out come

317
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,440

318
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:02,759
marijuana needs and we'll get you dialed

319
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:04,880
in together uh there was a little old

320
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:06,838
lady that came in she walked on a one of

321
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:08,159
the Walkers like the the the one that

322
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:09,399
goes in front it's got the tennis balls

323
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:10,958
on it you know what I'm talking about

324
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:12,679
she was hunched over she looked

325
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:14,599
unhealthy she didn't feel happy when he

326
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:17,000
spoke to her she seemed in pain and

327
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,680
miserable and nearly desperate after a

328
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,440
few weeks of coming to my dispensary she

329
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:23,039
was smoking a product that she had found

330
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:24,639
helped her her hunch went away her smile

331
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:27,120
came back her overall health was

332
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:28,919
improving and her quality of life and

333
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,759
her level of enjoyment of life was

334
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:32,559
improving moving so that's just one

335
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:35,439
person out of hundreds of people I got

336
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:37,919
to see at my dispensary that changed

337
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:40,760
everything when I saw that sort of stuff

338
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:42,399
like people coming in and the two or

339
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:44,120
three minute interaction we would have

340
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,958
just selling them their medicine and the

341
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:48,120
recommendations I could make and the

342
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:49,879
plants they were consuming was changing

343
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:51,879
their life it was improving the quality

344
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:54,078
of their life and that that changed my

345
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:56,039
entire Outlook my Approach my everything

346
00:11:54,078 --> 00:11:58,000
to this plant um if you would have asked

347
00:11:56,039 --> 00:11:59,439
me to make autof flowers before that

348
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,159
experience I might have done it because

349
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,760
there's money there I would have said

350
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:04,078
[ __ ] I'm missing a money opportunity

351
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:05,600
there's money on the table let's make

352
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:08,239
these autos and get that part of the

353
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,879
market but uh seeing those clients and

354
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,519
those people it sparked uh empathy and

355
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:14,679
compassion and it changed my outlook and

356
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:17,198
it changed my approach to the entire

357
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:19,159
plant the entire business of cannabis

358
00:12:17,198 --> 00:12:20,519
the entire passion of cannabis it

359
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:22,799
changed me a lot it changed me as a

360
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:24,879
person so uh those interactions with

361
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:26,479
those people at that dispensary um

362
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:28,639
really changes so this was never about a

363
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,440
money grab this was always maybe uh

364
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,278
maybe back in the day before I got into

365
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:34,839
the medical side when I was doing the

366
00:12:32,278 --> 00:12:36,278
black market thing that was uh that was

367
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:38,320
for money but the seed company the

368
00:12:36,278 --> 00:12:40,039
breeding that is never been a money grab

369
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,760
that's always been a lot of it was

370
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:44,679
because I was very frustrated with the

371
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:46,278
seeds I was buying I'd spend good money

372
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:47,919
on the website overseas I'm not even

373
00:12:46,278 --> 00:12:49,759
going to talk about their name I'm not

374
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:51,278
going to praise them or bash them they

375
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:53,039
were overpriced and a lot of the seeds

376
00:12:51,278 --> 00:12:55,159
that I bought sucked a lot of them came

377
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:57,319
crushed I would grow those seeds I'd

378
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:58,838
spend whatever you veg for four weeks

379
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:00,879
you flower for nine weeks it's [ __ ]

380
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:02,519
13 weeks and they would not be

381
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:04,759
satisfactory that's a lot of what got me

382
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:06,399
breeding I found a few things I did like

383
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:08,278
and I realized I can make seeds and I

384
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:10,399
started making my own seeds because I

385
00:13:08,278 --> 00:13:11,919
wasn't satisfied with what was available

386
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,120
and then I started seeing what the stuff

387
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:16,479
I was breeding was doing for people and

388
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:19,399
that definitely inspired me sparked me

389
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,879
