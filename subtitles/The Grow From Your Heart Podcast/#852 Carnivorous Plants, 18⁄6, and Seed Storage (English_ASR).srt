00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:47,079
all you have to do is go to that website

14
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:49,359
and find the tab that says grow help or

grow questions if you send me a good

16
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:53,280
grow question and I read that question

17
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:55,599
here on the podcast I'll send you a

18
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:59,280
coupon code for a free pack of seeds at

19
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:01,399
I direct.com the first question on

20
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,000
today's podcast C came from that growel

21
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:04,879
Tab and it came from my buddy Mike

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,560
Miller Mike Miller make sure you check

23
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,280
your inbox and your spam because you've

24
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,478
got a coupon code for a free pack of

25
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:14,000
seeds from idirect decom the question

26
00:01:11,478 --> 00:01:16,319
goes a little bit like this it says hey

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,879
rosted jef I'm switching my lights to

28
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:21,559
your recommended 186 light cycle for the

29
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:24,679
last two weeks of flower do I still use

30
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:27,159
a couple of hours of UV a day or does

31
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:28,600
the new light cycle replace that that is

32
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:30,520
a very good question there's a couple of

33
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:32,839
great things to talk about in here here

34
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:35,280
many people may be new to the podcast so

35
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:37,719
let me address this 186 light cycle at

36
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,000
the end of flower it is exactly what it

37
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:41,879
sounds like I recommend that you when

38
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,719
you are running a cultivar which you are

39
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:45,438
familiar with don't do this on the first

40
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:47,078
run do this with something that you've

41
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:49,239
ran a couple of times you know how long

42
00:01:47,078 --> 00:01:51,199
it takes to finish uh you know exactly

43
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:52,718
when to make this happen learn when that

44
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,719
plant is done if you've got a plant that

45
00:01:52,718 --> 00:01:57,199
finishes at 60 days start this at day 50

46
00:01:55,718 --> 00:01:59,959
if you've got a plant that finishes at

47
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,039
70 days start this at day 60 that is my

48
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:03,679
recommendation but I highly recommend

49
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:05,640
learning the cultivar before you

50
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,759
implement this practice now let's talk

51
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,520
more about it it is exactly what it

52
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,919
sounds like for the last 10 days of the

53
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:15,120
flowering phase I turn my lights back

54
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:17,199
onto an 18 hours on and 6 hours off

55
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,879
light cycle many people think that that

56
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:22,039
is wild Andor outrageous but most people

57
00:02:19,878 --> 00:02:24,439
who have tried it have reported positive

58
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:26,039
results and great feedback uh the only

59
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:28,039
people that have given me negative

60
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:30,959
feedback are the people who have not

61
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:33,439
tried it so I recommend 18 hours on and

62
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,800
6 hours off for the last 10 days of the

63
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:37,680
flowering phase why do I recommend this

64
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,920
because in my opinion in my experience

65
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,640
in my learning in my studies I have seen

66
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:43,839
that this does make our plants finish a

67
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:46,359
few days more quickly it also will make

68
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,039
them denser and beefier and it will also

69
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,400
give you more Harvest weight did I just

70
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:51,239
use the word denser I don't even think

71
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:53,319
that's a real word not going to edit

72
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:55,200
going to keep moving because it works

73
00:02:53,318 --> 00:02:57,560
right anyway my theory is that you get

74
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:59,199
more product sooner and it is more dense

75
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,840
and chunky and you get more of it who

76
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:02,639
doesn't want more more Bud more flour

77
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,920
more product that's going to definitely

78
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:07,158
help out the bottom line so the last 10

79
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:09,479
days of flour I recommend 18 hours on

80
00:03:07,158 --> 00:03:11,479
and 6 hours off until Harvest Time

81
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:12,719
people are going to say what about R

82
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:14,158
we're not going to give it that much

83
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:16,680
time we're going to cut it down way

84
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:19,280
before that does happen now the question

85
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:21,599
here is should this listener should this

86
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,479
grower be supplementing and implementing

87
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:26,959
their UV light in this process to be

88
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:29,318
completely honest with you I do not use

89
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,519
I do not add I do not supplement any UV

90
00:03:29,318 --> 00:03:32,919
light in my grow at this time it's

91
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,959
something I've studied something I've

92
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:37,000
thought about doing in the future but it

93
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,000
is not anything that I do at this point

94
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,639
so I don't have any solid input any

95
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,878
solid feedback for that question however

96
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:46,079
when people do ask me about this 186

97
00:03:43,878 --> 00:03:49,479
light cycle and making adjustments I

98
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:51,400
generally say all I change is the timer

99
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:53,078
that's the only thing I make different I

100
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,480
don't change the Spectrum I don't change

101
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:57,680
the intensity I just change the duration

102
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:59,959
is the only thing I change if you are

103
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,280
using a far Red Spectrum at the end of

104
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:04,158
the flowering cycle I may still continue

105
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,719
to do that at the end of the flowering

106
00:04:04,158 --> 00:04:07,919
cycle just to let them know hey it is

107
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:10,000
sleepy time that far red does uh

108
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:11,479
increase the uh the sleeping period it

109
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,360
makes them go to sleep much more quickly

110
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:15,199
is what I think I'm trying to say but

111
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,280
that is the only thing I can recommend

112
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:19,319
that you do use everything else I would

113
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:21,758
do just the same as you have been if

114
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:23,839
you're putting some uh LED or some UV in

115
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,160
there then do that don't change it do

116
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:27,879
everything the same except the duration

117
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,960
of the overall lighting if you're using

118
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:31,519
that far red definitely use that at the

119
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:33,198
end of the flowering cycle or at the end

120
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:35,079
of the light cycle at the end of the day

121
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,639
to make them go to sleep but that is the

122
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:38,240
only thing I can recommend the only

123
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,439
thing I've got true experience with the

124
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,600
UV I know that far red you want to keep

125
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:44,160
that going anything else uh you're ahead

126
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,479
of me because now you're doing

127
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,320
experiments that I have not had a chance

128
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:51,120
to do yet so you may learn some stuff I

129
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:52,959
don't even know uh do it try it uh home

130
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,038
here now try it out uh give me some

131
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:56,478
feedback I'd love to hear how this works

132
00:04:55,038 --> 00:04:58,759
for you I'd love to hear what method you

133
00:04:56,478 --> 00:05:00,560
do go with and also uh make sure you

151
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:40,399
Jeff I appreciate all of the Good Vibes

152
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:42,720
and the education you share with us hey

153
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:44,879
bro thank you very much I appreciate the

154
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,400
uh the positive feedback like that it

155
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:49,439
says it's definitely a great inspiration

156
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:51,079
I have got a two-part question bro I've

157
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:53,719
got a two-part answer you're only going

158
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:56,918
to win one pack of seeds but enjoy that

159
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:58,960
the question goes like this how do you

160
00:05:56,918 --> 00:06:02,000
store your seed stock to keep them

161
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:03,638
viable both longterm and just for a

162
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,199
year-ish all right that's a really good

163
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:09,800
question um just uh just a year-ish most

164
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:12,000
of my so anything that I bred for uh

165
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,598
sales for retail doesn't stick around

166
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,360
for a year those seeds don't stick

167
00:06:13,598 --> 00:06:17,000
around for a year it is very rare that I

168
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,639
have the same batch of seeds for more

169
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,279
than a year it's very uncommon uh

170
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:23,439
especially feminized seeds they sell

171
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:25,439
very quickly I make kind of I make small

172
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:27,120
batches and just continuously produce

173
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:29,279
things instead of making a whole bunch

174
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,038
of stuff and having it backstock uh so

175
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:33,038
most the stuff is fresh not even a year

176
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:35,079
old there is some outdoor stuff that

177
00:06:33,038 --> 00:06:37,680
does kind of get sat around it gets put

178
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:40,159
down at blowout prices those are in a

179
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,519
safe that is in a basement in a cool dry

180
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,840
dark place uh that is where those seeds

181
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:46,839
will be stored um so those are long-term

182
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:49,439
seeds don't stick around very long to be

183
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:51,399
honest anything for retail if it is for

184
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:53,038
my personal stuff it is if it's my

185
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:55,159
personal stash I've got a couple of

186
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:56,399
different options uh things that I'm

187
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,639
just preserving that I'm kind of

188
00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:00,279
hoarding that I'm collecting just to

189
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:03,079
have it I don't think I'll ever grow it

190
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:04,758
I might one day but I don't know because

191
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:06,878
I want to grow it but I also like having

192
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:08,840
it uh that's a weird that's a breeder

193
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:11,280
hoarder sort of a thing there those

194
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:14,198
things go in a safe that is in a very

195
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:16,598
cool dry dark place the safe that area

196
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:19,120
always stays in ambient cool temperature

197
00:07:16,598 --> 00:07:21,199
uh somewhere between 67 and 72 degrees

198
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,800
is it's always real nice in that area

199
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,639
there's a safe in there uh they're

200
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,120
tucked safely in an airtight container

201
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:29,360
in that safe that is my personal horde

202
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,199
my my collection my stash my show it off

203
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,080
on on Instagram and show all my friends

204
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:35,079
on Discord batch then I've got some

205
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:37,198
stuff that I'm going to grow fairly soon

206
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:39,318
or at least within the next few months

207
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,280
that stuff is in the crisper drawer of

208
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:43,280
my refrigerator it is in a in an

209
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:45,318
airtight container in the crisper drawer

210
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:47,038
of my refrigerator and those seeds won't

211
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:48,720
get played with and manipulated moved in

212
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:51,478
and out of that cold very often because

213
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,680
my concern is condensation think about

214
00:07:51,478 --> 00:07:55,000
as soon as you pull a soda or a package

215
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,918
of something out of the fridge that

216
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,519
condensation starts happening I don't

217
00:07:56,918 --> 00:08:00,318
want any of that moisture getting to my

218
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:02,359
seed stock and Dam damaging my seeds

219
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,720
moisture is what makes seeds germinate

220
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,038
so that could cause them to germinate

221
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:07,000
right inside the package I don't want to

222
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:08,478
open the fridge one day and have Sprouts

223
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,800
coming out of my [ __ ] seed storage

224
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:11,878
container that would break my heart so

225
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,639
if you're just going to leave them in

226
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:15,840
there for storage until growth or

227
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:17,918
storage for a long time yeah I do

228
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:20,198
recommend the uh the what is it called

229
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:21,359
the crisper drawer and the refrigerator

230
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:23,038
if you're just going to show your

231
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,439
friends them frequently and look at them

232
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:26,598
and go through them like their baseball

233
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:28,319
cards which isn't a bad a Bad Thing uh

234
00:08:26,598 --> 00:08:29,959
enjoy your seeds they're yours look at

235
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,759
them you spent money on them you worked

236
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:33,879
hard for them it takes a lot of time to

237
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,839
gather and collect these seeds look at

238
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:37,519
them enjoy them Marvel them show them to

239
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,440
your friends if you're going to do that

240
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,879
just keep them in a cool dry dark place

241
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,159
at that point I recommend somewhere

242
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:44,559
secure and safe uh if people know what

243
00:08:43,158 --> 00:08:46,120
they are these seeds are valuable it's

244
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:48,159
funny cuz to your wife and your

245
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:50,519
girlfriend they're just more stupid

246
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:52,360
seeds but to the right person those are

247
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:54,120
freaking gold it's funny how things work

248
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,519
like that but to the right person those

249
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,720
are valuable to some people that are

250
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:00,959
nothing but keep them in a cool safe

251
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:02,240
dark dry locked location that is my

252
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:04,278
recommendation there's more to this

253
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,079
question that I want to answer uh cool

254
00:09:04,278 --> 00:09:09,559
dry dark place is the most important

255
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:11,159
part uh do not use uh silicate packs I

256
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:13,239
don't like the silicate packs that is

257
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:14,879
going to keep moisture in there use a

258
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,399
desicant pack if you're going to store

259
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:18,799
your seeds in somewhere where there may

260
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:21,120
be moisture a desicant pack is what you

261
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:24,399
need that is what removes moisture not a

262
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:26,039
Bova the opposite the bovetas BEDA

263
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,000
however you want to say it today they

264
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:30,159
keep the moisture in we want to remove

265
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,639
moisture so use that silicate pack if

266
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:33,360
you can I buy the purple kind I can't

267
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:34,639
remember the brand name I'm surprised

268
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,399
there's not some Within Reach I've got a

269
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:38,360
bunch of them they start off purple and

270
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,519
they turn baby blue and they're dead uh

271
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:41,240
maybe it's the opposite maybe they start

272
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,240
off blue turn purple I don't know I know

273
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,278
when I pull them out of the package

274
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,159
they're fresh and I can tell when they

275
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:46,799
change colors I keep those with a lot of

276
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:48,838
my big batches of seeds just to keep

277
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:51,240
that moisture at Bay because like I said

278
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:53,640
moisture is the number one enemy for our

279
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:55,320
seeds until it's time to germinate now

280
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:57,679
uh retail seeds don't stick around that

281
00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:00,200
long most of the retail seeds uh stay in

282
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:02,078
a very cool dry dark place Place uh

283
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:04,920
climate controlled humidity controlled

284
00:10:02,078 --> 00:10:08,639
area um very safe very secure area lots

285
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:10,078
of locks security cameras um guards dogs

286
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:12,480
all that sort of [ __ ] I may be

287
00:10:10,078 --> 00:10:14,519
exaggerating for the sake of TV uh where

288
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,639
are we I got to catch myself up so that

289
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:17,039
is what we're going to do with the seeds

290
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:19,439
how do you store your seed stock to keep

291
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:21,120
them viable the crisper drawer or in a

292
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,279
shoe box in the safe in the basement to

293
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,919
be honest with you bro um longterm uh my

294
00:10:24,278 --> 00:10:27,759
retail seeds don't stick around long

295
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:29,479
term they sell I get them out of here if

296
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:30,958
they get close to being a year old put

297
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,759
them on clearance get them out super

298
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:35,078
quickly stay tuned for Black Friday

299
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:36,720
speaking of that um where are we what

300
00:10:35,078 --> 00:10:39,239
kind of cleaning machine do you use I'm

301
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,600
in the process of making one and I don't

302
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:44,000
want and I want to know if I'm going

303
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:45,839
overboard much love fam um that's a good

304
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,320
question man a good seed sorter is hard

305
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:51,760
to find sometimes I've seen two very

306
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:54,160
viable options one of them is uh it's

307
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:56,159
about 2 and a half or 3et tall it's a

308
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:58,679
pretty tall cumbersome machine it's

309
00:10:56,159 --> 00:11:00,719
about 3 feet tall 2 feet wide and it's

310
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:02,838
got uh vacuum attachment to it to where

311
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,320
you hook your shot back up to one side

312
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:08,160
you dump your uh material in one side it

313
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:10,800
falls down like a series of trap doors

314
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:12,958
and stairways and then the vacuum sucks

315
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:14,719
the usable material One Direction it

316
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:16,719
falls through one door or your seeds

317
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,959
fall through one door and the chaff is

318
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,480
what the other part is called falls

319
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:21,559
through another door and then a lot of

320
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:23,000
times I see that covered with a sheet of

321
00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:24,919
plexiglass so that you can actually

322
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,720
watch your material run through there

323
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:28,599
and you'll set up a shop vac on one side

324
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,240
two five gallon buckets pour your

325
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,159
material in the top turn on you turn on

326
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,120
the bu the vacuum first pour in the

327
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:35,759
material and it sucks the the

328
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:37,120
lightweight [ __ ] goes flying this way

329
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:39,159
cuz the vacuum and then all your seeds

330
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,639
fall to the bottom um and it's pretty

331
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:41,958
well separated sometimes you got to run

332
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:44,680
it twice depending on how quick and

333
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:46,679
sloppy you are uh that thing is very uh

334
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:48,278
very viable very usable but it requires

335
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:50,958
a shop vac which is another thing you

336
00:11:48,278 --> 00:11:52,639
have to have Andor buy and it's big it's

337
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:55,039
cumbersome it takes up quite a bit of

338
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:57,399
space unless you're running big batches

339
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:59,759
of seeds like an outdoor Harvest that

340
00:11:57,399 --> 00:12:01,360
thing is not necessary in my opinion

341
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:03,720
there's another device that is much

342
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:06,399
smaller it's about the size of a shoe

343
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:09,800
box I think it is called The Grow easy

344
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:12,039
or the easy seed seed sorder um I don't

345
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:14,120
remember the exact name it's a white box

346
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:16,278
it's got a blue Andor blue and green

347
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:18,759
logo on the front of it it's either easy

348
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:20,639
seed or grow easy seed sorder that's

349
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:22,879
what I use basically it's shaped like a

350
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,159
shoe box and it's got a little trap door

351
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:26,278
on the top of it which you pour your

352
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:28,399
material in it's got a computer fan

353
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:31,519
inside of there and there's a series of

354
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:33,278
angled uh Ledges I guess I don't know

355
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:35,120
how to I'm not an engineer but it's got

356
00:12:33,278 --> 00:12:37,198
a bunch of angles in there and the

357
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,679
computer fan blows the lightweight

358
00:12:37,198 --> 00:12:40,799
material which would be your dried up

359
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:43,039
weed material right off the top of it

360
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:45,719
and all the angles allow the seeds to

361
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:47,480
roll down and since the weed is lighter

362
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:49,560
it blows off into the second drawer and

363
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:51,480
since the seeds are heavier all of those

364
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:52,719
angles angle your seeds into another

365
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:55,039
drawer so then you get two little

366
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,959
drawers one is filled with seeds and one

367
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:58,838
is filled with your chaff at that point

368
00:12:56,958 --> 00:13:00,518
I'll take the seeds pour them into a bin

369
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:02,440
and then I'll run that chaff one more

370
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:03,799
time cuz a lot of times I'll get a few

371
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,880
more seeds enough to make it worth

372
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:08,159
running so the easy seed or the grow

373
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:09,958
easy seed sorter is my second option

374
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:12,639
that's what I use I bought one of those

375
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:13,879
it has lasted me um quite a while I hope

376
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:15,799
that thing doesn't burn out because it

377
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:17,519
has been well worth the money uh it

378
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:19,278
would be hard to replace it would it

379
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,799
would take uh it would take people a

380
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:22,919
full day to do the work that that thing

381
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:26,039
does in just a few seconds a few minutes

382
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:29,439
so the grow easy seed sorder is what I

383
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:30,838
recommend uh my dude good vibe herps I

384
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,199
feel like I've answered your question

385
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:35,320
and then some uh keep those seeds in a

386
00:13:33,198 --> 00:13:37,399
cool dry dark place I like that crisper

387
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:38,959
drawer uh for my personal seeds

388
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:42,958
everything else goes in a safe and a

389
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:45,759
basement uh in a lock secure area and I

390
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:47,958
like the uh grow easy seed sorder and I

391
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:49,759
also like that big Square thing that

392
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:52,119
you've seen advertised if you've Googled

393
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:54,000
seed separators you've seen this device

394
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:55,799
you've seen it I'm absolutely sure

395
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,600
another thing that I've seen people do

396
00:13:55,799 --> 00:13:59,359
is just get like a cardboard box a

397
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:02,040
shallow cardboard box something they

398
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,680
sell like cases of uh sodas or teas or

399
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:05,519
kombuchas in just the flat is what I

400
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:07,399
think you'd call it Pour all your stuff

401
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,560
in there and I've seen people lightly

402
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:11,519
use a shop vac and just keep Feathering

403
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:13,359
it brother and just lightly run that

404
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:15,198
shop vac over there separate your seed

405
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,159
from your material first of all get it

406
00:14:15,198 --> 00:14:19,039
real real dry talked about in the last

407
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:20,278
episode the unit of measurement for

408
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:21,639
amount of moisture you want in your

409
00:14:20,278 --> 00:14:24,399
seeds when you're trying to separate the

410
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:25,799
seed from the chaff is dry as [ __ ] of

411
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:27,879
course that is the exact unit of

412
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:30,479
measurement get it dry as [ __ ] I gr I

413
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:31,958
wear gloves I grind it up super dry and

414
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,199
tip that tray all the seeds are going to

415
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:35,679
run to the bottom and then just use a a

416
00:14:34,198 --> 00:14:37,639
credit card like your uncle used to do

417
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:39,879
when he was cleaning weed you can use

418
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:40,919
your ID a credit card your library card

419
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,799
do you guys even know what that is

420
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:44,240
anymore scoop up the weed up the tray

421
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:45,359
and it'll drop the seeds the seeds will

422
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,360
roll down because they're round and

423
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,120
heavier than the weed work on that for a

424
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,480
while get the chaff up top all the seeds

425
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,919
on the bottom and if you're careful and

426
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,639
gingerly about it you can use a shop vac

427
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:56,639
or a vacuum just to go across the top

428
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,560
and suck up all the chaff and the seeds

429
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,919
will be down on the bottom I had another

430
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:01,719
guy telling me that they simply put

431
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:03,599
panty hose over the end of that vacuum

432
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,920
hose and then they can suck it all up

433
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,560
and the seeds will stay right there if

434
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:08,039
they do [ __ ] up so there are a lot of

435
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:09,919
methods to doing this if you've got a

436
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:11,480
lot of chaff you can just pour it into a

437
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:13,559
bowl and scoop it right off the top

438
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:15,320
that'll give you a big head start off

439
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:16,479
and then you can shimmy that chaff

440
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:18,240
around a little bit and the seeds will

441
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,800
fall out there's a lot of ways to do it

442
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,519
a lot of ways to skin this cat but it's

443
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:23,958
not as daunting once you figure out some

444
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:26,480
methods oh the old school way um when I

445
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:27,719
started doing this I took um somebody

446
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,440
called it a colander somebody else

447
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,560
called it a strainer I've seen it called

448
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:34,360
several different things what it is is a

449
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:37,879
powdered sugar sifter it's a handle with

450
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:39,800
a ring on it with a little tiny mesh um

451
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:41,120
a net on there and you're supposed to

452
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:42,399
run your powdered sugar through there

453
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,839
and you shake it it makes the powdered

454
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,519
sugar real fine I was taking handfuls

455
00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:48,440
not hand like full handfuls but small

456
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:49,919
handfuls of material dropping it in

457
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,519
there and just rubbing it just rubbing

458
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:53,039
it around in a circle and all the

459
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,440
material falls out into the bowl and all

460
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:56,480
your seeds are left up here in the wire

461
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,839
mesh uh don't rub too hard because you

462
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,039
don't want to coarse up the seeds on

463
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,560
that mesh but give it a good rub jostle

464
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:03,799
them around and all that material fall

465
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:05,239
out the bottom so that's like a $9.99

466
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:06,879
method you could buy that bad [ __ ] at

467
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:08,919
Walmart and you can get your seeds out

468
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:10,799
of a small batch of material without

469
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:12,360
giving yourself a headache that way all

470
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:14,159
right my dude I've given you three or

471
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:16,399
four great methods I hope you have good

472
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:17,958
success in your seed sorting machine I

473
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:19,639
know this is Shameless but if you make

474
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:21,399
one of these great seed sorting machines

475
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:22,959
and you need somebody to run a prototype

476
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:25,360
I know a guy that makes a lot of seeds

477
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:27,039
and also could give you a huge shout out

478
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,600
on a podcast all right I'll give you my

479
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:30,240

557
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:13,240

a badass girl or I'm a bad [ __ ] uh

576
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:49,280

you for noticing now let's stay focused

584
00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:03,880
cuz that is hard today it says my

585
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,558
question is and this is the part that

586
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:07,200
everyone's been waiting for what are

587
00:20:05,558 --> 00:20:09,359
your thoughts on using carnivorous

588
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,480
plants for natural pest control for

589
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:13,959
indoor and outdoor grows it's a cool

590
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:16,640
idea I like it I in instantly thought of

591
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:18,079
ah feed me see more but it goes on it

592
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,200
says I'm currently venturing into

593
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:22,038
carnivorous plants and I have stumbled

594
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:24,880
upon a few house plants that would

595
00:20:22,038 --> 00:20:27,079
naturally help with uh plant pests and a

596
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:29,520
tent setup and dozens that would help

597
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:32,000
for outdoors but I've never heard or any

598
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:34,200
seen anyone grow uh these in the

599
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,960
community and use them for past

600
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:38,440
management bro this is a really cool and

601
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:40,798
creative idea I like the

602
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:43,200
idea um it would be a good addition but

603
00:20:40,798 --> 00:20:45,960
it's not anything that I would 100% rely

604
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,240
on for one major reason I like the idea

605
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,319
don't get me wrong I'm not dissing it

606
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:51,599
I'm not bashing it but carnivorous

607
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:53,759
plants are stationary and spidermites

608
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:56,319
and fungus snats and thrips are very

609
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:57,879
mobile and sure a portion of them are

610
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:59,918
going to go toward your carnivorous

611
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:01,840
plants but I need all of them to

612
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:03,799
sacrifice themselves to the volcano and

613
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:04,959
they're not going to do that so at that

614
00:21:03,798 --> 00:21:07,879
point I'm going to have to either

615
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:10,079
release my own uh Predator insects which

616
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:11,640
also are going to get uh demolished by

617
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:13,879
your carnivorous plants so then I'm kind

618
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:16,120
of paying for something to get eaten I'm

619
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:17,559
kind of sacrificing a few of my own uh

620
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:20,239
my own soldiers are going to jump in the

621
00:21:17,558 --> 00:21:22,558
volcano as well uh but or I need to

622
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,839
spray something and then am I damaging

623
00:21:22,558 --> 00:21:25,798
my uh my carnivorous plants by spraying

624
00:21:24,839 --> 00:21:28,000
because they're not going to get any

625
00:21:25,798 --> 00:21:30,918
food because now there's no bugs around

626
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,960
so they're stationary and that's the

627
00:21:30,919 --> 00:21:34,640
only thing I don't like about is that

628
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:36,038
they're stationary it's like having um

629
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,120
like it's like having security guards

630
00:21:36,038 --> 00:21:39,558
that it's like having [ __ ] crocodiles

631
00:21:38,119 --> 00:21:41,479
in the moat you got to get in the moat

632
00:21:39,558 --> 00:21:43,200
for those crocodiles to eat you I need

633
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:45,159
soldiers at the gate to make sure that

634
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,919
nobody even gets to the gate it's kind

635
00:21:45,159 --> 00:21:48,760
of that's a weird ass analogy but I'm

636
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:50,320
telling you bro greenlabs got to my head

637
00:21:48,759 --> 00:21:52,759
today thank you for jumping inside my

638
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:54,278
brain with me uh but I like the idea but

639
00:21:52,759 --> 00:21:55,640
they're stationary I want something out

640
00:21:54,278 --> 00:21:57,038
there getting [ __ ] done if you had

641
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:59,200
carnivorous plants they could walk

642
00:21:57,038 --> 00:22:00,720
around and eat [ __ ] I would be all about

643
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,120
it if you had carnivorous plants it

644
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,519
could detect hey the spider mites went

645
00:22:02,119 --> 00:22:05,119
to the top of this plant they would go

646
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:06,158
up there and eat it but once the mites

647
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:07,278
get to the top they're going to make

648
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:09,120
their webs they're going to make their

649
00:22:07,278 --> 00:22:10,480
little their little tepes up there and

650
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:11,839
they're not going to get down to your

651
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,839
carnivorous plants you're going to need

652
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:15,839
something else to battle that so it's a

653
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:18,038
really cool idea I Like It Outdoors it

654
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:19,720
sounds great uh if it battles all the uh

655
00:22:18,038 --> 00:22:21,558
the caterpillars and the mods that we

656
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:23,038
get here uh that would be awesome

657
00:22:21,558 --> 00:22:24,839
however I don't know if these

658
00:22:23,038 --> 00:22:26,759
carnivorous plants will survive in the

659
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:28,918
same environment as my ganja plants I

660
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:30,960
haven't done that research so the bottom

661
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:33,440
line I do like the idea it's a cool

662
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,919
[ __ ] idea uh they would work I'd put

663
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,360
them in the corners of the room every

664
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:39,120
corner maybe one in the middle or

665
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:40,639
something but uh they're stationary and

666
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:42,558
I need something more mobile that's why

667
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,640
I spray because I can cover the entire

668
00:22:42,558 --> 00:22:46,798
room uh that's why I release Predator

669
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,038
bugs because they'll go uh seek out when

670
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:49,639
they're hungry they're going to go hunt

671
00:22:48,038 --> 00:22:51,480
out some spidermites some thrips some

672
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:54,200
fungus snats whatever else you got

673
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:56,000
they'll go find it and eat it um even

674
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:57,600
though I don't 100% agree with your idea

675
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,159
I love the idea I don't know how

676
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:01,240
