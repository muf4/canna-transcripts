00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:29,419
from the grow help tap on the irie

35
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:31,618
genetics website if you go to

36
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:33,299
iregenetics.com there's a row of tabs on

37
00:01:31,618 --> 00:01:35,219
the top one of them does say grow

38
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:36,720
questions click on that we will give you

39
00:01:35,219 --> 00:01:38,578

43
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,700

51
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,299
genetic seeds let's jump into the grow

52
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,700
question it goes a little bit like this

53
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:07,618
it says yo Rasta Jeff I'm loving the

54
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,659
genetics bro I'm glad they're working

55
00:02:07,618 --> 00:02:11,340
well for you bro it goes on it says I do

56
00:02:09,659 --> 00:02:13,739
have a grow question good because that's

57
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:15,659
what we are here for my bro it says I

58
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:17,520
want to make some feminized seeds that's

59
00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:19,560
a good Mission he says I have the

60
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,520
ingredients for the STS solution so

61
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,039
they're going to make their own silver

62
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,780
thiosulfate solution if you want full

63
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:26,818
instructions on how to make that in my

64
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:29,280
method I've done a full podcast it is

65
00:02:26,818 --> 00:02:31,619
called my St yes mix go to YouTube

66
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,800
search for that or I should drop a link

67
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:36,060
in the YouTube video or possibly in the

68
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,980
wherever you're watching or listening

69
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:39,420
there should be a link all right so

70
00:02:37,979 --> 00:02:41,340
there should be a link to the STS

71
00:02:39,419 --> 00:02:43,018
solution video I'll tell you where to

72
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:45,659
buy everything how to mix it and mostly

73
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:47,459
how to apply it this question does say I

74
00:02:45,659 --> 00:02:49,620
would love to know what to expect and if

75
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:52,080
you have any tips do I spray just the

76
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:53,819
nodes before there are flowers expecting

77
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,519
both sex parts to develop on the area

78
00:02:53,818 --> 00:02:58,919
sprayed or is this whole plant going to

79
00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:00,840
respond ah thanks for the answers from

80
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:02,818
our friend Justin Case bro just in case

81
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,620
thank you for the great question I have

82
00:03:02,818 --> 00:03:06,839
recently done a podcast that covered a

83
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:08,459
lot of this but I realize that I may not

84
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,080
have talked a lot about actually

85
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:11,459
spraying the plant so there are a couple

86
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,920
of questions here I would love to know

87
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:15,479
what to expect well when you start

88
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:17,280
reversing this plant what I would

89
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:18,959
recommend and I've done a full episode

90
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,060
on this so this will be kind of just a

91
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,158
quick refresher what I recommend is

92
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:25,439
spraying the plant seven to ten days

93
00:03:23,158 --> 00:03:27,419
before you put that plant into flour

94
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:29,158
pull that plant out of the room maybe

95
00:03:27,419 --> 00:03:30,719
put some newspaper or something on the

96
00:03:29,158 --> 00:03:32,098
floor if you're doing it where the floor

97
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:34,560
needs to stay clean because when you

98
00:03:32,098 --> 00:03:36,899
apply apply the solution it may turn

99
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,819
white walls or white things a little bit

100
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:41,099
of a purple color so maybe put something

101
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:43,318
down move the plant out to there spray

102
00:03:41,098 --> 00:03:45,060
it now wait seven to ten days and do

103
00:03:43,318 --> 00:03:47,039
this again we're going to spray the

104
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:48,658
plant seven to ten days before flower

105
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:51,359
then we're going to put it into flour

106
00:03:48,658 --> 00:03:56,219
we're going to spray it on day one three

107
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:58,739
six nine twelve fifteen eighteen twenty

108
00:03:56,219 --> 00:04:01,199
one and if the plant is being stubborn I

109
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:02,759
will spray it again on day 24 that's my

110
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:04,378
own personal preference there I just

111
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:06,658
experiment with that last day sometimes

112
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:09,598
it's not necessary sometimes it is

113
00:04:06,658 --> 00:04:11,039
necessary so what to expect

114
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:12,419
um when you first spray the plant you

115
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:14,098
might not see anything when you first

116
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:16,500
spray the plant that plant May react

117
00:04:14,098 --> 00:04:18,659
strongly plants react very differently

118
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:21,238
to different dilutions and dosages of

119
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:22,860
the STS application sometimes you spray

120
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:24,659
a plant you don't notice anything happen

121
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:26,400
sometimes you spray a plant and tomorrow

122
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:28,080
it looks like those leaves are going

123
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:29,819
crazy they're balled up they're curl and

124
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:31,680
they're twisting they're changing colors

125
00:04:29,819 --> 00:04:33,120
that does look stressful but keep in

126
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,620
mind we're not growing this plant for

127
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,879
photogenic purposes we're not going to

128
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:37,680
make buds out of it we're not going to

129
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:39,719
make flowers we're disrupting this

130
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,400
plant's entire hormonal system so we're

131
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,500
going to see weird reactions from this

132
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:46,019
plant the main focus is that this plant

133
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:47,459
does produce pollen for us so sometimes

134
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:49,978
like I said those leaves are going to go

135
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:52,319
crazy crinkly twisty wild that's to be

136
00:04:49,978 --> 00:04:54,240
expected in some cases with reversals

137
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:56,399
sometimes that plant didn't want that

138
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,439
much silver sometimes it needed more

139
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:00,659
sometimes they just basically freak out

140
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:02,939
when we do reversals so you may see some

141
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:04,620
weird [ __ ] don't worry too much unless

142
00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:07,740
the plant is dying if you're not getting

143
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:09,060
any reaction to cause the pollen sacs to

144
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:11,400
form and the plant's looking like [ __ ]

145
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:12,780
then you're probably over spraying but

146
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:15,000
that it's hard to tell until you're

147
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:17,159
actually doing it how much spray to give

148
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,079
that plant I do have recommended dosage

149
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:21,360
rates in my podcast that I made earlier

150
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:23,459
but you do have to do some experimenting

151
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,139
and some adjusting so things to expect

152
00:05:23,459 --> 00:05:26,939
you may see some weird [ __ ] from the

153
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:28,379
leaves eventually you'll see little

154
00:05:26,939 --> 00:05:30,060
nubbins pop up where your flowers

155
00:05:28,379 --> 00:05:31,259
normally form so let's say this

156
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:33,120
microphone is the top of the flower

157
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:35,160
normally you get little pistols starting

158
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,840
to pop up and little a little braxal

159
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,220
form instead you're going to see it's

160
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:39,719
going to look like little balls popping

161
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:42,120
up and those are where the pollen sacks

162
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,680
are going to form so that's mainly the

163
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:46,199
first few things to look for and to

164
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,360
expect do I spray the nodes before the

165
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:50,400
flowers expect okay the question is do I

166
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:53,879
spray the nodes when I'm spraying silver

167
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:55,439
thiosulfate I spray the entire plant I

168
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:57,418
spray it from the bottom up I start at

169
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:59,279
the bottom I work my way up and I spray

170
00:05:57,418 --> 00:06:01,079
the tops of the leaves and the bottoms

171
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:03,659
of the leaves and I definitely spray the

172
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:05,399
center stalk and every Branch let's get

173
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:07,320
as much of this silver into the plant as

174
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:09,478
we can when it comes to pesticide

175
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:11,399
applications I may focus more on the

176
00:06:09,478 --> 00:06:13,860
leaves when it comes to the silver I am

177
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:15,239
trying to get the entire plant I don't

178
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:17,340
want to spray it till it's dripping off

179
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,840
maybe just a little bit of droplets

180
00:06:17,339 --> 00:06:20,939
coming off but not running off I want

181
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:23,099
that silver to stay on the plant I don't

182
00:06:20,939 --> 00:06:25,500
want it all to drip off and fall off the

183
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:28,199
plant and end up in the floor so spray

184
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:29,879
the entire plant then it says Ah do I

185
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:30,960
spray just the nodes before there are

186
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:33,959
flowers you're going to want to spray

187
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:36,538
early do I expect both sex parts to

188
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:37,978
develop on the area sprayed so that's a

189
00:06:36,538 --> 00:06:40,019
good question sometimes I've talked

190
00:06:37,978 --> 00:06:42,418
about this previously sometimes if you

191
00:06:40,019 --> 00:06:44,219
spray one branch of a plant sometimes

192
00:06:42,418 --> 00:06:46,500
that plant is real sensitive and the

193
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:48,180
entire plant will reverse sometimes if

194
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,800
you spray one branch of a plant the

195
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:51,900
plant is super stubborn and it will not

196
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:54,120
reverse at all sometimes if you spray

197
00:06:51,899 --> 00:06:55,620
one branch of a plant it will do the

198
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,418
magic best thing you could happen it

199
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:59,038
will make pollen on that one branch and

200
00:06:57,418 --> 00:07:00,719
the rest of the plant will stay female

201
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:01,918
you can either smoke the rest of that

202
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,900
plant I don't recommend it if you spray

203
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:05,579
it with silver but it's possible or you

204
00:07:03,899 --> 00:07:07,799
can pollinate the other side of that

205
00:07:05,579 --> 00:07:10,139
plant with your one side that is

206
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,879
reversed so the part that you spray is

207
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:14,160
going to reverse the part that you don't

208
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:16,860
spray possibly will not reverse I've

209
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:19,259
said it before this part is very plant

210
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:21,720
specific very phenotype specific every

211
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:23,400
plant will react differently to this so

212
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,800
like I said I'm going to recap that part

213
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:27,959
sometimes you will select one branch and

214
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,759
spray that one branch sometimes it

215
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:32,038
doesn't do anything sometimes it

216
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,840
reverses the entire plant sometimes it

217
00:07:32,038 --> 00:07:35,939
just reverses that one branch it kind of

218
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:37,918
depends on that plant and how it reacts

219
00:07:35,939 --> 00:07:40,139
to the silver now part of your question

220
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:41,519
was what can I expect now since we've

221
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:43,800
learned how to spray the plant properly

222
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:46,859
other things that you can expect are

223
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:49,560
around Day 26 to 32 you should start

224
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:52,620
seeing pollen I don't move the female

225
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:55,379
plants into the breeding room until I am

226
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:57,180
sure that this reversal is working so

227
00:07:55,379 --> 00:07:58,740
what that means to me is when I see

228
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:00,300
you'll be able to tell you'll say

229
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:02,579
something's way different on this plant

230
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:04,199
when the female flowers don't look like

231
00:08:02,579 --> 00:08:06,000
female flowers they look like male

232
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:07,800
flowers popping up when I am sure of

233
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,660
that when I can verify that the reversal

234
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,460
is working that's when I put the female

235
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:13,139
plants into flower and that times it

236
00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:14,459
pretty well because by the time the

237
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:16,500
pollen starts dropping from that

238
00:08:14,459 --> 00:08:18,659
reversal those females will be reaching

239
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:20,699
their Peak ovulation time so that is a

240
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:22,740
big big tip a big hint and definitely

241
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:24,780
something to look out for make sure the

242
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:26,939
reversal is working now I've talked

243
00:08:24,779 --> 00:08:29,219
about that extra day of spraying some

244
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:31,019
cultivars are stubborn if you stop

245
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:33,120
spraying they will revert and go right

246
00:08:31,019 --> 00:08:35,038
back to female it's going to be your

247
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,899
longer flowering cultivars that need

248
00:08:35,038 --> 00:08:38,458
that extra spray so if you've got

249
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:40,559
something that goes a little bit longer

250
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:42,418
maybe you've got an 11 or 12 week

251
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:44,218
flowering plant those are the plants

252
00:08:42,418 --> 00:08:47,519
where I would consider that one extra

253
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:49,260
spray of the STS solution so I think

254
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,700
this should answer the bulk of your

255
00:08:49,259 --> 00:08:52,980
question the main part of the question

256
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:55,080
was uh do I have any tips and what to

257
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:56,820
expect uh yeah look out for those male

258
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,680
parts to form on that plant that's the

259
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:00,120
most important part then work on the

260
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:02,039
timing once you see those male parts

261
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,720
forming move the females into the room

262
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:05,819
with that plant and then you should time

263
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,019
everything beautifully all right just in

264
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,940
case I feel like I've answered this

265
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:11,159
question pretty good the first part is

266
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:12,600
what to expect expect that female to

267
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:14,639
start showing you signs that it is

268
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,920
reversing into a male as soon as you see

269
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:18,899
those signs move that plant one thing I

270
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:20,399
recommend is document when that pollen

271
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:23,100
drops that way if you want to make more

272
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:25,320
seeds also document everything document

273
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:27,180
how you made the STS solution what

274
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,519
dilutions it was when you sprayed it

275
00:09:27,179 --> 00:09:31,739
document all of that then also document

276
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,360
when that pollen starts to drop so if

277
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:35,039
you do want to make more seeds we've got

278
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,539
a little bit of a guideline a little bit

279
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:38,759
of a timeline a little bit of a heads up

280
00:09:36,539 --> 00:09:40,980
some experience and documentation to

281
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:42,539
remind us what happened last time

282
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,740
um do I spray the whole thing we talked

283
00:09:42,539 --> 00:09:46,259
about that and we talked about which

284
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:48,419
part is going to reverse then after you

285
00:09:46,259 --> 00:09:50,100
do all the pollination then the next

286
00:09:48,419 --> 00:09:51,838
important part is to let those seeds

287
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:54,300
finish and then you get to the fun part

288
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,860
Harvest them grow them and then see what

289
00:09:54,299 --> 00:09:57,958
you've created that is always the fun

290
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:59,519
part my dude just in case thank you for

291
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:02,219
the great question once again please do

292
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:05,100
send me your address because I owe you a

293
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:06,660
pack of irie Genetics seeds all right

294
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,159
let's keep this party moving I do have

295
00:10:06,659 --> 00:10:10,319
another great question here in front of

296
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:12,899
me this one also came from the grow help

297
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,760
tab on the ire genetics website once

298
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:16,740
again if you've got a grow question go

299
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:18,958
to the ire genetics website find that

300
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:20,159
grow help tab send me your question if I

301
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:22,319
read your question here on the show

302
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:24,120
guess what you in a free pack of seeds

303
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,278
the next free pack of seeds goes to our

304
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:28,019
friend Smurf groan big shout out to

305
00:10:26,278 --> 00:10:29,820
Smurf groan please do send me your

306
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:31,679
address and a real name so that I can

307
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:33,778
get you a pack of seeds this question

308
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:35,819
goes a lot like this it says yo Rasta

309
00:10:33,778 --> 00:10:37,860
Jeff I have a breeding question when

310
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:39,540
making Femme seeds do you chop down and

311
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:42,480
remove the Reversed plant like you would

312
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:43,980
a regular mail and if so when do I do

313
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,680
this thank you for all the help from

314
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:48,839
Smurf groan this is a very good question

315
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:50,159
because a lot of us are limited on plant

316
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:51,959
count and we don't need that mail

317
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:53,639
sticking around too long because we want

318
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:55,139
to fill that plant count space with an

319
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:57,059
actual female plant that we can do

320
00:10:55,139 --> 00:10:58,439
something with or maybe you have that

321
00:10:57,059 --> 00:11:00,239
extra mail sticking around putting you

322
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,800
in limbo for your numbers I understand

323
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,600
why you may want to get rid of that mail

324
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:04,799
and not have them around too long we

325
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,899
want to clean up and get the next

326
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:08,458
project going with the mail around that

327
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:11,519
does kind of slow things and give you

328
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:13,500
some obstacles so what I like to do when

329
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:15,600
I make seeds most of the time I like to

330
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:17,820
pollinate two times I like to let my

331
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,339
pollen donor develop a nice big batch of

332
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:21,839
pollen then I do the pollen tap I tap

333
00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:23,760
that plant or shake that plant let the

334
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,260
pollen get into the room sometimes put

335
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:26,639
it right in front of the fan let's just

336
00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:28,980
get some pollen in the room do a

337
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:30,539
pollination then I'll wait five to ten

338
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:32,278
more days usually it's about seven days

339
00:11:30,539 --> 00:11:34,078
I go in there a week later and that

340
00:11:32,278 --> 00:11:35,700
plant has developed more pollen that's

341
00:11:34,078 --> 00:11:37,259
right it's built up more pollen he's had

342
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,579
some time to chill out he had a sandwich

343
00:11:37,259 --> 00:11:40,799
and a Gatorade he's ready to make

344
00:11:38,578 --> 00:11:43,078
another mess go in there and sprinkle

345
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:45,359
that pollen around after that second

346
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:48,000
pollination I generally cut the plant

347
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,500
down I'll take that big main top and

348
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,839
I'll cut that down if I want to gather

349
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:53,458
the pollen I'll put that big top in a

350
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,560
Pyrex dish and just let it sit for a

351
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:57,299
couple days and get real dry then I'm

352
00:11:55,559 --> 00:11:59,119
able to remove that pollen store it

353
00:11:57,299 --> 00:12:01,319
collect it and keep it for future uses

354
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,000
oftentimes if I don't want that pollen

355
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,800
for the future because most of the time

356
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,539
I honestly don't store pollen I've got

357
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:08,458
live plants I like to do live breeding

358
00:12:06,539 --> 00:12:10,259
that is my breeding style a lot of times

359
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:11,699
what I will do is I'll take that the

360
00:12:10,259 --> 00:12:13,200
main top of that plant and a couple of

361
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:15,000
the other bigger buds the male flowers

362
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,220
and I will hang them in the room

363
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,419
strategically over other plants and I'll

364
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:20,220
just hang them there for a couple of

365
00:12:18,419 --> 00:12:21,958
days and they will dry up very quickly

366
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:23,519
there's a lot of airflow there's a lot

367
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:26,518
of heat in the room the plant has been

368
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:28,200
cut it will dry as it dries that pollen

369
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:29,519
naturally falls out of the plant onto

370
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,800
the other plants that need to receive

371
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:33,539
pollen so that's just one more way to

372
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:36,419
get a little bit more pollen out of my

373
00:12:33,539 --> 00:12:38,519
reversal because honestly the reversals

374
00:12:36,419 --> 00:12:40,559
do not make a lot of pollen compared to

375
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:43,078
a regular male plant I think I get about

376
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:45,539
maybe a third as much pollen from a

377
00:12:43,078 --> 00:12:48,539
reversal as I do from a regular male

378
00:12:45,539 --> 00:12:50,338
pollen donor so I pollinate two times I

379
00:12:48,539 --> 00:12:51,899
Chuck the pollen the one time give them

380
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:54,120
a week to build another pollen load

381
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:55,740
check that other second load of pollen

382
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:57,240
then cut the tops off and hang them

383
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:58,980
upside down let them hang for a couple

384
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,419
days they'll naturally drop a little bit

385
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,980
of pollen but then after that once I'm

386
00:13:00,419 --> 00:13:03,299
tired of seeing them there I'll pull

387
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:04,980
down the tops and I'll smack it against

388
00:13:03,299 --> 00:13:06,958
the fan or against the other plants or

389
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:08,820
something just in an effort to knock out

390
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:10,679
that very last bit of pollen and get it

391
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:12,260
in the room so I can get as many seeds

392
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:14,399
as possible because like I said

393
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:16,620
reversals are stingy you don't get as

394
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,940
much pollen as you could from a regular

395
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:20,700
male plant it just doesn't give you the

396
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:23,399
big cloud the bunch of dust sometimes I

397
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:24,899
have to use multiple pollen donor plants

398
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:27,179
just to fill the room with enough pollen

399
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:29,339
to make it happen so that is when the

400
00:13:27,179 --> 00:13:31,259
plant goes in my experience in my room

401
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:33,000
uh he gives me one load of pollen he

402
00:13:31,259 --> 00:13:34,620
gives me another one then I cut him down

403
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,659
and I actually actually am able to get

404
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:38,700
more pollen from him a third time by

405
00:13:36,659 --> 00:13:40,019
smacking against the wall or the fan or

406
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:42,060
something like that or just beating it

407
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:44,159
on the other plants but once he's done

408
00:13:42,059 --> 00:13:46,500
he's done we can get him out of there I

409
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:48,958
usually do it after the second round of

410
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:50,399
pollination all right my dude Smurf

411
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:52,018
thank you for the great question please

412
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:54,600
do send me your shipping address and

413
00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:57,360
like I've said before I will not send a

414
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,980
box to Smurf groan Noah offense but

415
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,419
that's how we just cause problems for

416
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:02,700
ourselves put a real name on there

417
00:14:00,419 --> 00:14:04,139
nobody will have any questions and it

418
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,940
will make it to you that way everybody

419
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:07,320
wants their seeds to get to them all

420
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:09,240
right I do have one more great question

421

podcast for some time now and I

439
00:14:43,078 --> 00:14:47,578
absolutely love the vast variety of

440
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,019
information you give out there's a lot

441
00:14:47,578 --> 00:14:50,638
to unpack there are a lot to be thankful

time and thanks for thinking that I'm

444
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:56,939
giving you a vast variety of information

445
00:14:54,659 --> 00:14:58,379
I like that I noticed that sometimes I

446
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:00,240
do get stuck into the breeding questions

447
00:14:58,379 --> 00:15:01,620
because those are my favorites but I

448
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,000
really do try to mix it up have a

449
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:05,278
variety of info that I'm sharing with

450
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,078
you guys so thank you for noticing it

451
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:09,419
says much love brother much love to you

452
00:15:07,078 --> 00:15:11,458
so all as well it says so I recently

453
00:15:09,419 --> 00:15:13,500
found a female plant that I would love

454
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:15,479
to breed with and I'm still pretty new

455
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,799
to that side of growing

456
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,420
um that's the way it works bro somebody

457
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:20,698
was asking me recently how I do

458
00:15:18,419 --> 00:15:22,979
selections for breeding and I was like

459
00:15:20,698 --> 00:15:25,620
it just sometimes they just they just

460
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:26,759
talk to me I don't know exactly what it

461
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:28,860
is they don't talk to me that sounds

462
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:30,899
like a crazy person but the plant I'll

463
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:34,079
be looking in a grow room of a thousand

464
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:35,879
plants and I'll go that one and there's

465
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:37,500
just something about a plant that speaks

466
00:15:35,879 --> 00:15:39,299
to me as a breeder as a grower that just

467
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,620
says hey you should breed with me it

468
00:15:39,299 --> 00:15:42,659
sounds like a plant just jumped up and

469
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:43,919
said hey I need you because these plants

470
00:15:42,659 --> 00:15:45,480
are here doing their own thing and it

471
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:47,399
knows that it needs you to breed to it

472
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:49,199
so that plant called on you and got your

473
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:51,899
attention I'm glad you're paying

474
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:53,759
attention it does go on it says

475
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:55,500
um I absolutely dig this girl and how

476
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:58,019
well she handles stress that's a great

477
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:59,940
trait for a eating plant and even smokes

478
00:15:58,019 --> 00:16:01,980
and produces some flower rosin it sounds

479
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:03,839
like you got a true winner there it says

480
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:05,579
I absolutely dig this girl oh wait I

481
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,380
skipped some [ __ ] there we go now I'm on

482
00:16:05,578 --> 00:16:08,879
the hunt for a good male to bring into

483
00:16:07,379 --> 00:16:10,620
the party

484
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:13,078
um so that brings me one quick question

485
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:14,639
right away uh if this plant is so

486
00:16:13,078 --> 00:16:16,500
amazing and so perfect why do you want

487
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,639
to breed to it like is that uh do you

488
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,679
want to improve it do you want to

489
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:21,419
reproduce it do you want to add those

490
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:23,519
traits to something else I'm just

491
00:16:21,419 --> 00:16:25,740
curious what your goal is because a lot

492
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:27,539
of breeding is all based on that goal so

493
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:29,759
I want to know what you plan to do with

494
00:16:27,539 --> 00:16:31,679
this perfect plan if you want it to be a

495
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,360
contributor to a project if you want to

496
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:35,099
carry that line on if you want to see

497
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,240
what it does when you mix it with other

498
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:38,159
[ __ ] I'm just curious what your

499
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,919
intentions and your goal are now it goes

500
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:42,899
on it says for the strain I love would I

501
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:45,659
be better to hunt a male to breed with

502
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:47,759
or stick with the female to carry on the

503
00:16:45,659 --> 00:16:49,679
traits I hope this makes sense in some

504
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:53,159
way thank you for the good time sir and

505
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:54,659
much love from Marley's grow room no

506
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:56,519
this totally makes sense and that's kind

507
00:16:54,659 --> 00:16:59,159
of what I was touching on you've got a

508
00:16:56,519 --> 00:17:02,220
few options here if you just want to

509
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:04,619
reproduce this plant for preservation

510
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:06,058
purposes if you want to make more seeds

511
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:07,859
of this plant just to see what it does

512
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:11,220
we've got a couple of options one of our

513
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:12,418
options is to make feminized self seeds

514
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:14,939
that's one of the first things I would

515
00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:16,319
do for preservation since this plant has

516
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:18,660
really got your attention it would be

517
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:20,099
heartbreaking if we lost this plant of

518
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:21,839
course we could take clones we can have

519
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:24,000
a mother plant that's always great but

520
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:25,859
[ __ ] happens sometimes the power goes

521
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,199
out sometimes we have fires floods and

522
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:30,178
disasters I hope you don't but that [ __ ]

523
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:31,620
does happen if one of those things were

524
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:34,380
to happen it would be great to have a

525
00:17:31,619 --> 00:17:36,538
backup supply of seeds of this plant a

526
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:39,179
really easy way to do that is to cut two

527
00:17:36,538 --> 00:17:40,859
clones spray one with silver Don't Spray

528
00:17:39,179 --> 00:17:43,559
the other apply the pollen to the other

529
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:47,339
you will make feminized seeds of your

530
00:17:43,558 --> 00:17:49,619
favorite cut approximately 30 percent of

531
00:17:47,339 --> 00:17:51,779
those seeds will grow to look just like

532
00:17:49,619 --> 00:17:53,339
the plant that you used there will be

533
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:54,779
some outliers there will be some plants

534
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:56,519
that look like the moms some plants look

535
00:17:54,779 --> 00:17:58,319
like the dad and there'll be some plants

536
00:17:56,519 --> 00:18:00,480
that look like some totally weird [ __ ]

537
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:02,639
but the plant that you are seeking will

538
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,960
be in that preservation pack that's what

539
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,940
I would call it that first batch of

540
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,919
preservation pack now you've got other

541
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:10,140
options here if you want to do true

542
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:12,480
breeding to a male to a female I would

543
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:14,580
find a male that compliments that female

544
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:17,038
there are several ways to go about it

545
00:18:14,579 --> 00:18:19,678
one thing that I always find successful

546
00:18:17,038 --> 00:18:21,960
I find a plant that is the opposite of

547
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,519
the plant I am breeding to so I don't

548
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:25,860
know anything about your breeding plant

549
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:28,200
let's just say that it is tall it is

550
00:18:25,859 --> 00:18:30,418
Slender and it tastes like lemons I

551
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:32,519
would find something short and squatty

552
00:18:30,419 --> 00:18:34,380
that tasted like chocolate just because

553
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:36,119
they're so vastly different than when

554
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:38,160
you combine those you're going to make

555
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:39,899
brand new amazing [ __ ] with a lot of

556
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,600
great opportunities a lot of good

557
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:44,820
potential if you bread your tall slender

558
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:46,740
lemon plant to a tall slender lemon

559
00:18:44,819 --> 00:18:48,298
plant we're just making more [ __ ]

560
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:50,640
tall slender to lemon plants if you

561
00:18:48,298 --> 00:18:52,139
bring that tall slender lemon to a tall

562
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,360
slender strawberry you're going to get

563
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:56,038
tall slender strawberries and lemons

564
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:57,298
let's try to make something new and

565
00:18:56,038 --> 00:19:00,000
different instead of just copying the

566
00:18:57,298 --> 00:19:01,679
[ __ ] that we've already got unless that

567
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,538
is your goal if you just want to find a

568
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:05,220
male that just helps you to produce

569
00:19:03,538 --> 00:19:07,379
seeds from this plant just to see what

570
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:09,240
it does but one of my favorite things to

571
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:11,160
do is to take one male plant and

572
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,779
pollinate multiple females that way I

573
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:14,880
can see what that male plant is bringing

574
00:19:12,779 --> 00:19:17,038
to the mix so you've got options you can

575
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,780
reverse it and if you reverse it you can

576
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:21,000
actually pollinate more females as well

577
00:19:18,779 --> 00:19:22,440
that's always fun different females and

578
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,720
you can still see what that reversal

579
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:26,700
adds to the mix as a breeder but your

580
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,500
first option one of your options is to

581
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:31,140
reverse this plant make Femme seeds out

582
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:33,000
of it or you can breed it to a male that

583
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:34,980
is vastly different then that is going

584
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,599
to give you brand new crosses once

585
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:38,819
you've got that brand new cross then I

586
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:40,558
would consider doing a back cross find

587
00:19:38,819 --> 00:19:42,538
one so you've got the perfect female

588
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:44,519
then I would find a male plant that

589
00:19:42,538 --> 00:19:46,200
looks just like the original female that

590
00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:47,879
you've got and I would breed that male

591
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:50,100
to the female now you made your back

592
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:51,660
cross one then I would find another male

593
00:19:50,099 --> 00:19:53,459
out of that batch of seeds it looks just

594
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:55,200
like the female read it back to that

595
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:57,240
original mom again you got a back cross

596
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,880
too keep going eventually you're going

597
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:02,640
to make exceeds that make exact copies

598
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:04,799
around F5 F6 you should make exact

599
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,720
stable copies of the plant you were

600
00:20:04,798 --> 00:20:08,279
working with so this does make great

601
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,500
sense this is a great question but

602
00:20:08,279 --> 00:20:12,240
without knowing what your overall goal

603
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,919
is and without knowing what you want to

604
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,900
do with this plant what your vision is

605
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:17,460
what your dream is I don't know exactly

606
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:19,440
the ways to guide you but I know that

607
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:21,240
your options you can reverse this plant

608
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,400
or you can pollinate it with the male

609
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:25,679
your selection of the mail is going to

610
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:27,120
make a big influence on the future of

611
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:29,460
this breeding project you want to open

612
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:31,019
it up and bring out brand new [ __ ] or do

613
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:32,340
you want to dial in the traits that you

614
00:20:31,019 --> 00:20:34,319
already like that's where you make

615
00:20:32,339 --> 00:20:35,639
breeding decisions I do love that you're

616
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:37,798
inspired to breed and I love that you

617
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:39,360
come to me for questions please do send

618
00:20:37,798 --> 00:20:41,940
me a follow-up so that we can give you

619
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:43,319
more and better guidance on this to get

620
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:45,600
you in the direction that you're trying

621
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:47,038
to go send me some specifics let me know

622
