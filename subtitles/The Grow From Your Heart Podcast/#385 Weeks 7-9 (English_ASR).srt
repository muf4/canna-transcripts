00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:07,679
podcast this episode is brought to you

4
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,480

need new seeds in your garden I highly

6
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:17,240
recommend the hella dank seed company

7
00:00:11,218 --> 00:00:17,239
and you can find them at www.sedar.com

8
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:22,679
by letting you know what I'm smoking

9
00:00:20,368 --> 00:00:24,839
today I've been taking dabs of goat

10
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:27,448
power ambrosia from our friends at

11
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:29,518
apothecary farms this smells just like

12
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:31,349
golden goat it tastes just like golden

13
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:33,659
goat and it has got that sativa punch

14
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:35,159
that golden goat brings and I love it

15
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:36,959
I've always been a big fan of golden

16
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:40,949
goat so this is a delicious concentrate

17
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:43,230
the label says it is 74.8% THC with a

18
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:45,359
total of 86 point four percent total

19
00:00:43,229 --> 00:00:47,099
cannabinoids I really like smoking the

20
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:48,509
goat power and gets my brain fired up

21
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,090
and it tastes amazing

22
00:00:48,509 --> 00:00:52,079
so that is a quality concentrate ladies

23
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:53,789
and gentlemen this is going to be

24
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,378
another grow lesson if you've been

25
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:57,570
following along you know I've been doing

26
00:00:55,378 --> 00:00:59,608
a long series of grow lessons in this

27
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:01,558
lesson we are going to do week seven

28
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:03,270
through nine we are wrapping up the grow

29
00:01:01,558 --> 00:01:04,588
it's almost time to harvest so we're

30
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,060
gonna talk about the final weeks of

31
00:01:04,588 --> 00:01:07,679
flowering we'll work our way into

32
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:10,019
Flushing and a little bit of defoliation

33
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,570
if you haven't been following along I

34
00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:14,158
recommend you go back to episode 351 and

35
00:01:12,569 --> 00:01:16,079
start listening to the grow lessons if

36
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,609
you are an experienced grower or if

37
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:19,319
you've been following along or if you

38
00:01:17,609 --> 00:01:22,680
feel like you were up to speed let's

39
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:24,298
jump right into this grow lesson at this

40
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,330
stage of the flowering cycle we are

41
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:28,680
entering what I call the third trimester

42
00:01:26,329 --> 00:01:30,750
most of our plants are going to take

43
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,030
between eight and ten weeks to flower I

44
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:35,340
think nine weeks is a good template to

45
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:37,379
setup these grow lessons if your plants

46
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:40,380
are going to take more than nine weeks

47
00:01:37,379 --> 00:01:43,199
I suggest you extend my advice for week

48
00:01:40,379 --> 00:01:45,599
seven one more week just repeat the week

49
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,759
seven feeding the temperature the

50
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:49,709
humidity just repeat week seven one more

51
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,750
time if you've got a longer flowering

52
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:53,548
cultivar now I understand if you're

53
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,959
growing from seed you may not know how

54
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:56,490
long your plants are going to take to

55
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:58,228
flower you're going to have to pay

56
00:01:56,489 --> 00:02:00,478
attention to the trichomes you're going

57
00:01:58,228 --> 00:02:02,819
to have to be prepared to flush about 10

58
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:04,739
or 14 days before harvest this is going

59
00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:07,500
to take a close eye you need to pay

60
00:02:04,739 --> 00:02:08,939
attention to your trichomes often times

61
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,378
when I'm running seeds that are

62
00:02:08,939 --> 00:02:12,750
brand-new and I don't know what to

63
00:02:10,378 --> 00:02:13,679
expect I already decided they're going

64
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,840
70 days

65
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,689
I want to let them flower 70 days and

66
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,579
see what they give me if I decide 70

67
00:02:18,688 --> 00:02:22,530
days was too long I can run them less

68
00:02:20,579 --> 00:02:24,480
time next time but I like to give them

69
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:26,908
the opportunity to show me what could

70
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:28,828
happen if I go a little bit too long

71
00:02:26,908 --> 00:02:30,780
some plants really like to bulk up that

72
00:02:28,829 --> 00:02:33,269
last week some plants really put on some

73
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:34,680
extra trichomes that final week some

74
00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:36,959
plants really don't do [ __ ] for that

75
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:39,150
last week except over ripen you're going

76
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:42,000
to have to learn your specific cultivar

77
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:43,890
in most cases you will discover that 9

78
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,930
weeks is just about right for most

79
00:02:43,889 --> 00:02:47,818
plants some will take 10 weeks if you

80
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:49,920
want to get them perfect so I'm already

81
00:02:47,818 --> 00:02:52,229
in 8 weeks which is really advantageous

82
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:54,059
because that puts us a week ahead we can

83
00:02:52,229 --> 00:02:56,219
produce another crop in a commercial

84
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:57,719
environment that really helps out but

85
00:02:56,219 --> 00:03:01,169
for these lessons we're going to focus

86
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:03,598
on a 9 week cultivar so we are now at

87
00:03:01,169 --> 00:03:05,188
the start of week seven in our flowering

88
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:07,048
phase at this point the buds are

89
00:03:05,188 --> 00:03:08,608
starting to get really fat they should

90
00:03:07,049 --> 00:03:10,889
be getting really sticky they should be

91
00:03:08,609 --> 00:03:12,930
putting off some very nice aromas by now

92
00:03:10,889 --> 00:03:15,450
they may be starting to make some very

93
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:17,730
nice colors if you are growing from seed

94
00:03:15,449 --> 00:03:19,469
different phenotypes will start becoming

95
00:03:17,729 --> 00:03:21,509
very obvious at this point in the

96
00:03:19,469 --> 00:03:23,310
flowering stage you may have one

97
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:24,628
phenotype that has gotten way taller you

98
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:26,370
may have a phenotype that has stayed

99
00:03:24,628 --> 00:03:28,679
shorter you may have one that is way

100
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:29,730
branch ear you will really start seeing

101
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,099
the different traits

102
00:03:29,729 --> 00:03:34,289
now that we are later in flower so week

103
00:03:32,098 --> 00:03:35,729
7 is what I call the fill week the buds

104
00:03:34,289 --> 00:03:36,900
will really start filling in the

105
00:03:35,729 --> 00:03:39,328
trichomes will really start getting

106
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:41,519
dense this is when the photos really

107
00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:43,680
start getting hot I think weeks six

108
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,780
through nine are great for photos it

109
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,729
only gets better as we go on until it is

110
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,199
time for harvest so get out your camera

111
00:03:47,729 --> 00:03:51,359
and take some great photos you're gonna

112
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:53,159
get good beefy buds you're gonna get

113
00:03:51,359 --> 00:03:54,419
good trichome development and soon

114
00:03:53,158 --> 00:03:57,689
you're going to start getting those

115
00:03:54,419 --> 00:03:59,790
sweet fall colors now let's focus in on

116
00:03:57,689 --> 00:04:02,250
the environmental conditions for our

117
00:03:59,789 --> 00:04:04,709
grow room in week seven of flower our

118
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:06,689
buds are getting big and beefy so we

119
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:08,459
need to reduce the humidity if we have

120
00:04:06,689 --> 00:04:10,318
too much humidity in the room we do run

121
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:12,539
the risk of bud rot we run the risk of

122
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:14,039
powdery mildew so let's reduce the

123
00:04:12,539 --> 00:04:15,959
humidity let's bring it down to around

124
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:18,269
thirty or forty percent relative

125
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:21,329
humidity in the room this will help us

126
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:22,918
reduce the risk of bud rot so the first

127
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:25,139
change is that we should reduce the

128
00:04:22,918 --> 00:04:27,269
humidity by five to ten percent if

129
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:29,879
possible the next thing I would wreck

130
00:04:27,269 --> 00:04:32,519
is to reduce the temperature by just a

131
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:33,960
few degrees if possible we have been

132
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:36,180
running our flowering room somewhere

133
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:38,250
between 70 and 80 degrees during the day

134
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:40,800
I would like to knock that down just

135
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:41,490
three to five degrees if possible let's

136
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,610
try to get it

137
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:45,240
77 to 75 degrees in there and as the

138
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:47,189
week's go on

139
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:50,098
I would like to reduce it about three to

140
00:04:47,189 --> 00:04:51,990
five degrees every week until harvest so

141
00:04:50,098 --> 00:04:54,089
this week let's drop it down by three

142
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:56,430
degrees if you're already at 80 degrees

143
00:04:54,089 --> 00:04:59,879
let's get it down to 77 if you're down

144
00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:01,740
at 77 let's crank it down about 75 let's

145
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:03,719
make these plants think that winter is

146
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:05,370
coming that colder environment will

147
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,050
bring out more colors that colder

148
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:08,819
environment will bring out more terpenes

149
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:10,800
that colder environment will make your

150
00:05:08,819 --> 00:05:12,840
buds more dense and I feel like it also

151
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,550
speeds up the finishing time of our

152
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:17,459
plants so let's make it just a little

153
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:19,740
bit colder during week seven now let's

154
00:05:17,459 --> 00:05:21,568
talk about our nutrients for week seven

155
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:24,478
this is going to be our last opportunity

156
00:05:21,569 --> 00:05:26,490
for feeding our plants we can start

157
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:28,288
reducing our base nutrients we don't

158
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:30,300
need as much nitrogen phosphorus and

159
00:05:28,288 --> 00:05:32,550
potassium as we have in the past

160
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:34,770
you can almost eliminate the nitrogen at

161
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:36,389
this phase of flowering we don't want to

162
00:05:34,769 --> 00:05:38,098
overfeed them but we do want to make

163
00:05:36,389 --> 00:05:39,900
sure that they get a nice boost for

164
00:05:38,098 --> 00:05:41,848
their last feeding so make sure you

165
00:05:39,899 --> 00:05:43,560
include some phosphorus and potassium to

166
00:05:41,848 --> 00:05:45,689
make those buds swell I would also

167
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,250
include some cal-mag don't go too hard

168
00:05:45,689 --> 00:05:48,718
on the calmac at this point because it

169
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:50,848
is really hard to flush it out and you

170
00:05:48,718 --> 00:05:52,978
may taste it if you go too hard with

171
00:05:50,848 --> 00:05:54,990
cal-mag at this point I would always

172
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:56,879
encourage a kelp product this late in

173
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:59,579
flower that will add to your flavors and

174
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:01,468
aromas I do like an enzymatic product

175
00:05:59,579 --> 00:06:04,379
this late in flower because it keeps my

176
00:06:01,468 --> 00:06:06,300
root zone healthy I also use a microbe

177
00:06:04,379 --> 00:06:08,038
product this late in flower I have

178
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,930
mentioned that we should taper off the

179
00:06:08,038 --> 00:06:12,478
microbes and start increasing the bloom

180
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:14,939
boosters but if your budget will allow I

181
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:17,250
would include microbe products this late

182
00:06:14,939 --> 00:06:20,098
in flower now the thing to focus on on

183
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:21,839
this feeding is one final bloom booster

184
00:06:20,098 --> 00:06:23,759
feeding I don't know what product you're

185
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:26,339
using as a bloom booster but this is

186
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,050
probably your last opportunity to add

187
00:06:26,339 --> 00:06:29,399
that bloom booster to your nutrient

188
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:30,990
regimen so make sure you get that in

189
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:34,138
there at this speeding time this is the

190
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:35,879
last week to fertilize our plants next

191
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:37,800
week we are going to begin the flushing

192
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:39,629
phase so if you want to boost those

193
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,770
plants up one last time if you've been

194
00:06:39,629 --> 00:06:42,089
saving one bottle of

195
00:06:40,769 --> 00:06:43,649
something or one little scoop of

196
00:06:42,089 --> 00:06:45,959
something this is the last time to

197
00:06:43,649 --> 00:06:47,698
fertilize those plants because at the

198
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:51,120
start of week 8 we are going to begin

199
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:53,250
the flush phase now at this point in the

200
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,168
game we've got big fat chunky buds I

201
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:57,569
shouldn't have to say this but I want to

202
00:06:55,168 --> 00:07:00,149
remind everybody it is too late to spray

203
00:06:57,569 --> 00:07:02,669
any pesticides on these plants they are

204
00:07:00,149 --> 00:07:04,439
coming down in 21 days we don't want the

205
00:07:02,668 --> 00:07:06,930
plants to taste like anything we apply

206
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:10,168
it as a pesticide so please do not spray

207
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:12,000
your plants also do not use a sulfur

208
00:07:10,168 --> 00:07:14,189
burner I've mentioned that in previous

209
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,990
episodes using a sulfur burner at this

210
00:07:14,189 --> 00:07:18,240
point and flower will make your plants

211
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:20,639
taste like total [ __ ] it will taste like

212
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:23,280
smoking a pack of matches or it will

213
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,990
taste like smoking a can of fish so

214
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:26,668
please turn off the sulfur burner and

215
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:28,288
flower I wish everybody would just get

216
00:07:26,668 --> 00:07:30,089
rid of the sulfur burner and find out

217
00:07:28,288 --> 00:07:33,240
what is actually causing the problem and

218
00:07:30,089 --> 00:07:35,549
cure the problem so no pesticides no

219
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:37,860
sulfur burners this latent flower what

220
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:39,750
is acceptable is predator bugs if you

221
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:41,669
have got a pest issue release an

222
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:43,019
excessive amount of predator bugs

223
00:07:41,668 --> 00:07:44,818
hopefully you've been on top of that

224
00:07:43,019 --> 00:07:47,129
hopefully you don't have a problem but I

225
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:49,860
understand [ __ ] happens in cultivation

226
00:07:47,129 --> 00:07:52,139
so predator bugs are the way to go at

227
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:53,759
this stage of the game the little

228
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:55,439
sachets that you hang the little teabag

229
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,449
looking things it's too late for those

230
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:59,278
you need the live predators that are

231
00:07:57,449 --> 00:08:00,449
ready to release that are hungry that

232
00:07:59,278 --> 00:08:02,519
are ready to get in there and destroy

233
00:08:00,449 --> 00:08:04,139
your spider mites or whatever pests you

234
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:05,728
may have acquired you need the live

235
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:07,259
active bugs they're a little more

236
00:08:05,728 --> 00:08:09,418
expensive but they are the only thing

237
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:12,180
that are effective at this stage of

238
00:08:09,418 --> 00:08:13,918
flower so again do not spray anything do

239
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:16,408
not use a sulfur burner and if you do

240
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:18,389
see any insects any pests get in there

241
00:08:16,408 --> 00:08:20,310
with some predator bugs and hopefully

242
00:08:18,389 --> 00:08:22,800
those predators will eradicate your

243
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:25,168
infestation another thing you can do is

244
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,990
defoliate if you do see any signs of

245
00:08:25,168 --> 00:08:29,158
pests remove any infested leaves mark

246
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:30,840
the plant so that you know where that

247
00:08:29,158 --> 00:08:32,788
infestation was and come check

248
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:35,848
frequently do what you can to minimize

249
00:08:32,788 --> 00:08:38,309
the problem in that area at this point

250
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:41,099
in the game I also suggest you defoliate

251
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:42,689
any yellow or funky leaves any leaves

252
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:44,879
that look unhealthy are pests

253
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:46,950
attractants so get those dead funky

254
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:48,870
leaves out of the grow defoliate

255
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:50,730
anything that is obvious that needs to

256
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:51,990
come off if you've got some nice fall

257
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:53,610
looking colors and you want to leave

258
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:55,169
those pretty leaves on there for photo

259
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:57,330
you can do that but the minute it starts

260
00:08:55,169 --> 00:08:59,519
getting crunchy and it is dead decaying

261
00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:01,950
matter it needs to come off of the plant

262
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,419
it is okay to have a few dead leaves at

263
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:05,220
this point in the game we've got a full

264
00:09:03,419 --> 00:09:07,169
grow we've got a full canopy we've got a

265
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:08,610
lot of space there will be some dead

266
00:09:07,169 --> 00:09:10,289
funky leaves in the garden

267
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:12,149
sometimes a leaf just doesn't get enough

268
00:09:10,289 --> 00:09:13,769
light sometimes a branch gets bumped

269
00:09:12,149 --> 00:09:16,019
things will happen you will have some

270
00:09:13,769 --> 00:09:17,699
funky leaves don't freak out if it is

271
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:19,769
excessive you may have a problem that

272
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:22,230
needs to be diagnosed but a few funky

273
00:09:19,769 --> 00:09:24,059
leaves at this stage are not a problem

274
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:25,740
now another thing we should keep our

275
00:09:24,059 --> 00:09:29,009
eyes open for at this stage of the game

276
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:31,049
are late flower hermaphrodites you

277
00:09:29,009 --> 00:09:32,610
should be scouting daily for pests you

278
00:09:31,049 --> 00:09:35,279
should be scouting daily for powdery

279
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:37,230
mildew and botrytis during that visual

280
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:39,720
inspection you should also be looking

281
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:41,580
for hermaphrodites look at the top buds

282
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,139
of the plants look at the middle buds of

283
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,550
the plants and definitely look at the

284
00:09:43,139 --> 00:09:46,980
lower part of the plant where you were

285
00:09:44,549 --> 00:09:50,009
not getting a lot of light do you see

286
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:52,620
any male flowers do you know what a male

287
00:09:50,009 --> 00:09:54,720
flower looks like could you identify a

288
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:57,480
hermaphrodite flower if it walked up and

289
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,220
bit you on the nose if not I recommend

290
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,990
you do a little bit of google research

291
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:03,300
and know what a hermaphrodite flower

292
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:05,669
looks like so you do not allow them to

293
00:10:03,299 --> 00:10:07,169
happen in your garden so at this point

294
00:10:05,669 --> 00:10:09,479
of the game we still need to keep our

295
00:10:07,169 --> 00:10:11,629
eyes open for pests and mold problems

296
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,920
and we also need to keep an eye out for

297
00:10:11,629 --> 00:10:16,230
hermaphrodites now I've spoken in a

298
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:18,599
previous episode about how to handle the

299
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:20,789
Herms if you should get one don't freak

300
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,680
out don't go crazy spray it with some

301
00:10:20,789 --> 00:10:24,629
water and think of your options do you

302
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:26,219
want to remove the male flower do you

303
00:10:24,629 --> 00:10:27,629
want to remove the bud do you want to

304
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:29,700
remove the branch or do you want to get

305
00:10:27,629 --> 00:10:31,559
rid of that whole plant it is up to you

306
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:33,690
it is your garden you're going to have

307
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:35,489
to make decisions like that if there is

308
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:37,110
just one little hermaphrodite flower I

309
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:38,850
would spray it with water pick it out

310
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:41,039
with tweezers if you've got two or three

311
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:42,930
that are on one bud maybe cut that bud

312
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:44,730
or that branch off if you've got several

313
00:10:42,929 --> 00:10:46,529
hermaphrodite flowers popping up in

314
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:48,629
different spots on a plant it may be

315
00:10:46,529 --> 00:10:50,159
time to get rid of that plant you have a

316
00:10:48,629 --> 00:10:52,080
lot of things to think about because

317
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:54,120
this lay in flower will those male

318
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,889
flowers do anything to the rest of your

319
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,990
crop if you're just running one

320
00:10:55,889 --> 00:11:00,569
flowering cycle you're probably too late

321
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:02,549
into the grow to seed anything if you've

322
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:04,710
got a perpetual cycle going on those

323
00:11:02,549 --> 00:11:06,809
plants that are earlier in flower may be

324
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:08,730
ready to receive that pollen should

325
00:11:06,809 --> 00:11:10,859
hermaphrodite released pollen so you've

326
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:12,720
got things to think about now if you do

327
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:14,550
have hermaphroditic plant in your grow

328
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,290
room don't give clones of that to

329
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:18,449
anybody please don't pass out

330
00:11:16,289 --> 00:11:20,129
hermaphrodite clones to your friends if

331
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:21,778
you want to continue to grow it that is

332
00:11:20,129 --> 00:11:23,250
fine but don't give a her amount to

333
00:11:21,778 --> 00:11:25,139
anybody you're setting them up for

334
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:27,509
failure we don't want to do that to our

335
00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:29,338
friends and fellow growers now the last

336
00:11:27,509 --> 00:11:31,649
things I have written down for week 7 is

337
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:33,540
plenty of airflow we need a lot of

338
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:35,579
airflow in the grow room as these buds

339
00:11:33,539 --> 00:11:38,429
start getting chunkier we may need more

340
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:40,050
fans I want to see every leaf move

341
00:11:38,429 --> 00:11:42,120
I don't need every plant and every leaf

342
00:11:40,049 --> 00:11:43,889
getting beat down by the wind but I want

343
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:46,169
every leaf just to get a little rustle

344
00:11:43,889 --> 00:11:48,539
occasionally as the fans oscillate I

345
00:11:46,169 --> 00:11:50,099
want every fan to just feel that fresh

346
00:11:48,539 --> 00:11:51,569
air just change that air around my

347
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:53,220
leaves that way I know the environment

348
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:55,110
is getting shuffled we don't have a

349
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:56,879
bunch of co2 in one area we don't have a

350
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:58,980
bunch of humidity packed up over here I

351
00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:00,990
want to mix that air all day long and

352
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:03,120
keep that air fresh for my plants so

353
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:05,970
have plenty of airflow in your grow as

354
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,409
we get late into flower now the next

355
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:10,110
thing I want to talk about is kind of

356
00:12:07,409 --> 00:12:12,539
preparing us for the future we plan to

357
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:15,089
cut this crop down in approximately 21

358
00:12:12,539 --> 00:12:18,029
days do you have seeds or clones

359
00:12:15,089 --> 00:12:20,460
prepared for your next run if you have

360
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:22,740
another grow space now is the time to

361
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:24,600
get your seeds or clones prepared for

362
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:26,669
your next run that way we don't have a

363
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,409
bunch of downtime that way as soon as

364
00:12:26,669 --> 00:12:30,149
these plants are harvested you can move

365
00:12:28,409 --> 00:12:32,819
fresh plants right into that grow room

366
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:34,919
and never miss a day in the future I do

367
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:37,560
plan on updating my perpetual grow

368
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:41,009
lesson I did write a very long perpetual

369
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:42,329
grow podcast I think it is episode 73 so

370
00:12:41,009 --> 00:12:44,669
if you're interested in scheduling a

371
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:46,500
perpetual grow go check out episode 73

372
00:12:44,669 --> 00:12:48,240
but I will update that because in

373
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,980
Colorado we have made quite a few

374
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,709
changes to our laws I want to write a

375
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:54,870
perpetual grow episode based around our

376
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:55,769
Colorado plant count limits so that is

377
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:58,980
coming in the future

378
00:12:55,769 --> 00:13:01,439
but let's focus on today you need to get

379
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:04,409
plants prepared for your next run if you

380
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,270
have got an available veg space so now

381
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:08,490
is the time to buy clones or acquire

382
00:13:06,269 --> 00:13:10,439
clones from either your fellow growers

383
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:12,419
or a dispensary or however you get them

384
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:14,490
or now is the time to start germinating

385
00:13:12,419 --> 00:13:16,049
seeds and getting them started so that

386
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:18,120
when that grow room is empty we can

387
00:13:16,049 --> 00:13:20,338
clean it up and we can refill it and you

388
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,789
never miss a day in there so that is the

389
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:22,620
basic

390
00:13:20,789 --> 00:13:24,990
of week seven of the flowering cycle

391
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:27,240
let's move right into week eight in week

392
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:28,769
eight we want to continue to reduce the

393
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:31,049
temperature and humidity

394
00:13:28,769 --> 00:13:33,329
let's get that humidity down between 25

395
00:13:31,049 --> 00:13:34,709
and 35 percent relative humidity this

396
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:36,120
will make it a little bit dry in the

397
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:38,759
room for the last two weeks but it will

398
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:40,679
also help us prevent powdery mildew and

399
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:42,539
boy Titus we don't want to get mold

400
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:44,849
right at the center of our big giant

401
00:13:42,539 --> 00:13:46,799
buds so let's start by reducing the

402
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:49,170
humidity the next thing we can do is we

403
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:51,299
can reduce the temperature by three to

404
00:13:49,169 --> 00:13:53,309
five degrees at this point of the phase

405
00:13:51,299 --> 00:13:56,129
I would like to be somewhere between 70

406
00:13:53,309 --> 00:13:58,649
and 74 degrees Fahrenheit during the

407
00:13:56,129 --> 00:14:01,200
lights on cycle now week eight is what I

408
00:13:58,649 --> 00:14:03,419
call the final swell week you will see

409
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,980
your buds take off they will get huge

410
00:14:03,419 --> 00:14:07,740
they will get chunky they will start

411
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:09,659
becoming covered in trichomes it is time

412
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:13,230
to really start paying attention to your

413
00:14:09,659 --> 00:14:15,269
trichomes with a sixty or 100x powered

414
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:17,129
microscope you need to get in there and

415
00:14:15,269 --> 00:14:17,789
look at those trichome heads see what

416
00:14:17,129 --> 00:14:19,559
color they are

417
00:14:17,789 --> 00:14:21,629
are they clear are they getting that

418
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:23,729
milky whitish blue color have they

419
00:14:21,629 --> 00:14:25,799
started becoming amber that is how you

420
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:27,629
determine the ripeness of your cannabis

421
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:29,250
plants so it's time to get in there and

422
00:14:27,629 --> 00:14:31,889
start paying close attention to the

423
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:33,779
trichomes on our cannabis plants now

424
00:14:31,889 --> 00:14:36,299
these plants are also going to be super

425
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:38,519
sticky and super stinky but they should

426
00:14:36,299 --> 00:14:41,099
also be putting off some amazing colors

427
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:44,069
so now is another great opportunity to

428
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:45,930
take more photography as we enter the

429
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:47,580
flush phase we will start seeing more

430
00:14:45,929 --> 00:14:49,049
colors come from the plants we're going

431
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:50,490
to start removing nutrients from the

432
00:14:49,049 --> 00:14:52,199
plants we're gonna push some of the

433
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:54,060
color out some of the green is going to

434
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,950
disappear which will allow room for reds

435
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:57,509
and golds and a lot of great colors that

436
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:59,460
you didn't know we're coming from these

437
00:14:57,509 --> 00:15:02,220
plants this is going to be an exciting

438
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:03,900
two weeks so we've reduced the humidity

439
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:06,540
we have reduced the temperature now

440
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:09,600
let's start flushing our plants flushing

441
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:11,189
is free I have done an entire episode on

442
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,730
flushing our cannabis plants it is

443
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:16,350
episode three twenty into great detail

444
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:18,960
quickly here I will explain how and why

445
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:20,610
we flush for the past at least nine

446
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:22,080
weeks we have been shoving nutrients

447
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:24,600
into these plants they are filled with a

448
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:26,400
lot of nutrients we do not want to smoke

449
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,080
all of those nutrients they are stored

450
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,000
in the buds they are stored within that

451
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:31,860
plant by flushing the plant we are

452
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,139
starving it of nutrients we will make

453
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:34,620
that plant use up all of the nutrients

454
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:37,049
store

455
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:39,210
within its systems we will also remove

456
00:15:37,049 --> 00:15:41,669
all of the nutrients from the soil so we

457
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:43,590
basically want to wash out the medium to

458
00:15:41,669 --> 00:15:45,629
make no nutrients available to allow

459
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:47,280
that plant to starve itself so that it

460
00:15:45,629 --> 00:15:49,799
will use up all of the nutrients that is

461
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:51,449
stored over its flowering cycle by

462
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:53,669
removing the nutrients from all of the

463
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:56,850
buds it will make the buds burn and

464
00:15:53,669 --> 00:15:58,889
smoke and taste much better if they are

465
00:15:56,850 --> 00:16:00,240
properly dried and cured we still need

466
00:15:58,889 --> 00:16:02,220
to get all the way through a harvest and

467
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,500
drying cure phase but at this point

468
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:07,050
flushing is the first step to getting a

469
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:09,269
tasty final product so let's start

470
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:11,309
flushing flushing is very easy when you

471
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:13,559
water the plants don't add any nutrients

472
00:16:11,309 --> 00:16:15,959
you can adjust the pH somewhere between

473
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:17,279
six two and six five and just water the

474
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:19,680
plants until you get twenty percent

475
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:22,049
runoff if you pour in a gallon of water

476
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:24,149
in a pot you want twenty percent of that

477
00:16:22,049 --> 00:16:26,219
gallon to run right out of the bottom of

478
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:28,049
that pot so give them a few heavy

479
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:30,450
waterings and you will wash out all of

480
00:16:28,049 --> 00:16:32,549
those nutrients then just continue to

481
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:35,070
water until harvest time that is

482
00:16:32,549 --> 00:16:37,229
flushing it is simple and it is free and

483
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:40,080
it will make your plants taste so much

484
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:41,850
better if you do it correctly have you

485
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:43,560
ever smoked flowers that taste like you

486
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:46,409
just stuck your tongue in a white socket

487
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:48,989
chances are those buds were not flushed

488
00:16:46,409 --> 00:16:51,179
properly that person did not allow a 10

489
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:53,100
to 14 day flush phase before he

490
00:16:51,179 --> 00:16:55,289
harvested his plants and now they taste

491
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:56,879
like complete [ __ ] flush your plants

492
00:16:55,289 --> 00:16:58,679
I've centered a couple times already it

493
00:16:56,879 --> 00:17:00,480
is free why don't you want to do free

494
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:02,909
[ __ ] to your plants you don't have to

495
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,899
use nutrients and it saves time all you

496
00:17:02,909 --> 00:17:04,409
got to do is fill the container with

497
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:06,509
water

498
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:08,790
adjust the pH pour it on the damn plants

499
00:17:06,509 --> 00:17:10,529
let's flush the plants that is what we

500
00:17:08,789 --> 00:17:13,200
were going to focus on in weeks eight

501
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:15,450
through nine is flushing the plants for

502
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:18,059
harvest so that they taste good once we

503
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:20,970
dry and cure them now before I harvest I

504
00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:23,579
like to do a pre harvest defoliation I

505
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:25,829
generally like to do this seven to ten

506
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:27,569
days before harvest so that may happen

507
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:30,029
in the middle of week eight or at the

508
00:17:27,569 --> 00:17:32,159
beginning of week nine any leaf that has

509
00:17:30,029 --> 00:17:33,690
a pea deal that I can grab I just go in

510
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,100
there and peel it right off I don't need

511
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:36,840
a bunch of leaves at this point of the

512
00:17:35,099 --> 00:17:38,730
flowering phase those leaves have done

513
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:40,289
their job it is almost time to cut down

514
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:42,299
these plants I want to make the harvest

515
00:17:40,289 --> 00:17:44,099
crews job just a little bit easier so I

516
00:17:42,299 --> 00:17:46,259
like to go through and pull off all of

517
00:17:44,099 --> 00:17:47,279
the big leaves seven to ten days before

518
00:17:46,259 --> 00:17:49,799
harvest

519
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:52,649
now that is a good way to segue us right

520
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:54,089
into week number nine at the beginning

521
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:56,160
of week nine if you haven't done it

522
00:17:54,089 --> 00:17:58,470
already feel free to go in there and

523
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,060
pull off all of the big leaves those

524
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:00,990
leaves have done their jobs we don't

525
00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:02,460
need them anymore

526
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:04,440
let's take them off of there and get

527
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:06,539
them out of the room now let's talk

528
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:09,090
about the environmental conditions in

529
00:18:06,539 --> 00:18:12,720
our grow room for week nine this is the

530
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:14,819
final week of our flowering phase I like

531
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,890
to reduce the humidity to approximately

532
00:18:14,819 --> 00:18:19,289
twenty-five to thirty percent humidity

533
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:21,360
at the end of the flowering phase my

534
00:18:19,289 --> 00:18:23,579
buds are huge my buds are chunky I do

535
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:26,309
not want to risk bud rot in the middle

536
00:18:23,579 --> 00:18:27,750
of those buds so I reduced that humidity

537
00:18:26,309 --> 00:18:30,629
down to about twenty five percent

538
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:33,390
relative humidity in my flowering room I

539
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:36,570
also like to get it nice and cool if I

540
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:38,520
can get it about 70 to 74 degrees for

541
00:18:36,569 --> 00:18:40,710
the last week of flower that really will

542
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:42,240
make the colors pop out of the plants it

543
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:44,009
will make them more dense and it will

544
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,720
give you more trichomes and I really

545
00:18:44,009 --> 00:18:47,670
think the plant to pack on a little beef

546
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:49,920
once it gets colder and it will also

547
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:51,810
speed them up I feel like making it nice

548
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:53,400
and cold at the end of the season tricks

549
00:18:51,809 --> 00:18:55,500
our plants into believing it is fall

550
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:57,180
winter is coming they say oh I don't

551
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,650
have a lot of time left to live so you

552
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:00,750
really start doing everything they can

553
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:02,640
do to ripen up and reach the end of

554
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:04,200
their life cycle so that's why I try to

555
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,900
make it a little colder in the grow room

556
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:08,789
at the end of the grow cycle another

557
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:10,590
thing that a lot of growers like to do

558
00:19:08,789 --> 00:19:13,049
at the end of a flowering cycle is

559
00:19:10,589 --> 00:19:15,990
reduce the lights currently you're

560
00:19:13,049 --> 00:19:17,879
probably running 12 on and 12 off toward

561
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:20,880
the end of the flowering cycle you can

562
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:23,280
always reduce it to 10 on and 14 off

563
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,930
reducing your light cycle will also make

564
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:26,789
the plants think that the end is near

565
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:28,950
they will speed up a little bit and they

566
00:19:26,789 --> 00:19:30,659
will finish more quickly I think that

567
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:32,340
having it a little bit cooler and having

568
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:34,140
a little less light in the room makes

569
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:35,789
the plants finish a little sooner it

570
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:37,560
also makes them pack on a little more

571
00:19:35,789 --> 00:19:40,049
trichomes it makes the buds a little

572
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:42,720
more dense and also I think it gives us

573
00:19:40,049 --> 00:19:44,519
a little more terpene presence terpenes

574
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,589
are destroyed by light terpenes are

575
00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:48,660
destroyed by warmth why not give them a

576
00:19:46,589 --> 00:19:50,849
little cool and a little dark and we can

577
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:52,410
have a little more Terps and we're also

578
00:19:50,849 --> 00:19:54,209
saving a little bit of money we're not

579
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:55,830
using nutrients because we're flushing

580
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:57,329
and now we're running the lights for two

581
00:19:55,829 --> 00:19:59,579
hours less per day so we're saving

582
00:19:57,329 --> 00:20:00,689
electricity we're saving the electricity

583
00:19:59,579 --> 00:20:02,189
on running the bulbs

584
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:03,930
plus we're probably saving a little bit

585
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:05,820
of electricity on cooling since we don't

586
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:07,350
have to cool to fight those lights so we

587
00:20:05,819 --> 00:20:09,720
were saving electricity and we're also

588
00:20:07,349 --> 00:20:11,759
saving time on our gear so why not

589
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:14,130
reduce the lights just a couple of hours

590
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:15,359
at the last week of flower now here's a

591
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:17,310
little secret that I haven't shared with

592
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:19,589
a lot of people if you've got a plant

593
00:20:17,309 --> 00:20:20,909
that takes way too long to flower and

594
00:20:19,589 --> 00:20:23,490
you need to speed it up just a little

595
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:25,410
bit you can reduce those lights by 4

596
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:27,839
hours at the end of flowering and those

597
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:30,180
plants will finish approximately a week

598
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:32,339
earlier if you've got a 10 week strain

599
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:34,259
or an 11 week strain and at the end of

600
00:20:32,339 --> 00:20:36,929
week 9 you crank those lights down to

601
00:20:34,259 --> 00:20:40,019
eight hours on at 16 hours off that

602
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:41,850
plant will finish one solid week early

603
00:20:40,019 --> 00:20:43,170
now you may not get the harvest weight

604
00:20:41,849 --> 00:20:45,719
you would get if you let it go for that

605
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:47,789
full 11 or 12 week period but sometimes

606
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:49,680
we just need the plants to be done we

607
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:51,480
need that space we need that room so

608
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:54,060
that is always a trick you can use to

609
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:55,410
speed up some plants so we have reduced

610
00:20:54,059 --> 00:20:56,970
humidity we have reduced our

611
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:58,650
temperatures now we have reduced our

612
00:20:56,970 --> 00:21:01,319
light cycle we are on the final

613
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:03,870
homestretch here in week 9 keep flushing

614
00:21:01,319 --> 00:21:06,329
don't add any nutrients obviously please

615
00:21:03,869 --> 00:21:08,069
do not apply any pesticides or any

616
00:21:06,329 --> 00:21:09,629
foliar feeds to your plants this late

617
00:21:08,069 --> 00:21:11,730
and flower you will taste it you will

618
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:14,220
notice it it will ruin the entire crop

619
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:16,170
this week is our final bulking and

620
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:16,680
ripening week you will see that final

621
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:18,390
bulk

622
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:19,620
come on they'll start getting fat and

623
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:20,940
chunky all of your leaves are gonna

624
00:21:19,619 --> 00:21:22,259
start getting yellow and starting to

625
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:23,519
droop down and get a little crinkly

626
00:21:22,259 --> 00:21:25,379
because we've been flushing and

627
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:27,180
hopefully you're paying attention to

628
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:28,950
those trichomes because this is when the

629
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:31,019
trichomes are really going to start

630
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:33,960
turning amber and showing their progress

631
00:21:31,019 --> 00:21:36,329
so week 9 is the bulk and ripen week it

632
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:38,759
is almost time to chop down the plants

633
00:21:36,329 --> 00:21:40,589
so keep a close eye on the trichomes we

634
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:42,539
have been flushing if you decide the

635
00:21:40,589 --> 00:21:44,369
plants are not done and you want to let

636
00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:46,349
them go a little bit longer you can let

637
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:48,000
them flower for an extra week and you

638
00:21:46,349 --> 00:21:50,339
don't have to give them any more

639
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,839
nutrients don't mess your whole cycle up

640
00:21:50,339 --> 00:21:53,369
by adding nutrients in and then trying

641
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:54,779
to cut it down seven days later

642
00:21:53,369 --> 00:21:56,849
you've already been flushing you're

643
00:21:54,779 --> 00:21:58,829
already doing it perfectly don't mess it

644
00:21:56,849 --> 00:22:01,649
up now if it needs to go longer

645
00:21:58,829 --> 00:22:02,159
let it go longer if you are early in

646
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:04,170
Flour

647
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:07,259
and you anticipate you may need an extra

648
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:09,180
week or two again repeat my advice from

649
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:11,129
week seven week seven is where you

650
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:13,680
extend your schedule if you're going to

651
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:14,820
go longer than three weeks so let's act

652
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,860
like we are right on

653
00:22:14,819 --> 00:22:18,659
we're ending up week nine we have d

654
00:22:16,859 --> 00:22:19,559
foliated the plants we haven't ran into

655
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:21,660
any problems

656
00:22:19,559 --> 00:22:23,970
the next thing to think about is do you

657
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:27,180
have your harvest and drying and curing

658
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:29,519
area prepared are you ready for a sticky

659
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:31,650
stinky time consuming and space

660
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:33,839
consuming harvest when you cut down the

661
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:36,090
plants where are you going to hang them

662
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:38,849
they're going to be there for at least a

663
00:22:36,089 --> 00:22:40,649
week maybe 7 to 14 days depending on

664
00:22:38,849 --> 00:22:43,409
your environment do you have space for

665
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:45,690
that is it secure is it safe will people

666
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:48,150
be showing up when people show up are

667
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:50,400
they going to smell your hanging plants

668
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:52,620
do you need to plan ahead to keep that

669
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,180
aroma away from visitors do you need to

670
00:22:52,619 --> 00:22:56,339
do something to keep intruders and

671
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:58,320
thieves away from that harvested product

672
00:22:56,339 --> 00:23:00,480
now is the time to start thinking about

673
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:01,950
that you don't want to say hey it's the

674
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,120
time to cut down these plants and walk

675
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:04,890
in there with scissors and cut them down

676
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:07,639
and then you're stuck you don't know

677
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:10,470
what to do start thinking about that now

678
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:12,690

to harvest these plants that is only

681
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:18,360
followed by drying and curing and the

682
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:20,700
next step after that is to clean and

683
00:23:18,359 --> 00:23:23,099
