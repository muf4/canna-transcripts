dank seed company and you can find them

8
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:40,710
at www.steveadubato.org if smells

9
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:42,870
delicious if you have ever smelled or

10
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:44,460
smoked a golden goat this is exactly

11
00:00:42,869 --> 00:00:45,899
what golden goat smells like to me I'm

12
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:49,140
giving it a fresh smell so I can give

13
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:51,899
you a fair description it's got a hint

14
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,789
of citrus not overpowering citrus but it

15
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:56,730
does have a citrus base to it with a

16
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:58,800
tropical pineapple and a juicy fruit gum

17
00:00:56,729 --> 00:01:01,229
sort of aroma on top of it

18
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:03,299
- that stickiness that a juicy fruit

19
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:04,798
piece of gum would have I know it's

20
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:06,420
weird to say something smells sticky I

21
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,490
think that stickiness is part of the

22
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,719
flavor and aroma of the gum it doesn't

23
00:01:08,489 --> 00:01:12,478
have that it's got that tropical

24
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:15,179
sweetness it's got some citrus it's got

25
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:17,368
a hint of pineapple mostly a citrus and

26
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,830
tropical fruit sort of a thing going on

27
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:22,769
I would really describe it as a orange

28
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:24,298
pineapple tropical fruit Jolly Rancher

29
00:01:22,769 --> 00:01:26,429
would probably be the most accurate

30
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:28,829
description that I could nail it down -

31
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:31,200
so that's the aroma and flavor it has

32
00:01:28,828 --> 00:01:32,728
got a beautiful golden color to it it's

33
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,200
got just the right amount of diamonds

34
00:01:32,728 --> 00:01:36,840
just the right amount of sauce in there

35
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,520
beautiful beautiful goat power from our

36
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,710
friends at apothecary farms and

37
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:42,929
obviously it has got me amped up and

38
00:01:40,709 --> 00:01:45,359
ready to talk my face off so this should

39
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:47,070
be a great podcast if you've been

40
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:49,200
following along you know I've been doing

41
00:01:47,069 --> 00:01:52,169
a long series of in-depth grow lessons

42
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,000
in episode 351 we talked about setting a

43
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:56,100
goal for the garden then we talked about

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,359
picking a space for the garden then we

45
00:01:56,099 --> 00:01:59,099
talked about the appropriate equipment

46
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:01,078
and setting up the grow safely and

47
00:01:59,099 --> 00:02:03,298
effectively then we work our way through

48
00:02:01,078 --> 00:02:05,339
getting clones and starting a grow at

49
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:07,770
this point we are all the way to week

50
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:10,920
four of the grow in this episode we're

51
00:02:07,769 --> 00:02:12,539
going to talk about weeks 4 5 &amp; 6 if

52
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:13,679
you're a new grower or if you're new to

53
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:16,048
the podcast

54
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,819
I suggest you head back to episode 351

55
00:02:16,049 --> 00:02:20,099
and start with the droll essence there

56
00:02:17,818 --> 00:02:21,899
if you are an experienced grower or if

57
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:23,818
you feel like you were up to speed or if

58
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:26,519
you've been following along let's jump

59
00:02:23,818 --> 00:02:28,530
right into a grow lesson in this lesson

60
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:31,319
we are going to focus on episodes four

61
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:33,389
five and six of the flowering phase at

62
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:35,218
this point of flowering it should be

63
00:02:33,389 --> 00:02:36,780
obvious where the bud sites are going to

64
00:02:35,218 --> 00:02:38,068
be you should have little buds popping

65
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,359
up they should look like little

66
00:02:38,068 --> 00:02:41,310
dandelions they're starting to actually

67
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:43,709
form into buds by now it should be

68
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:45,840
clearly obvious where the buds are it

69
00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:48,060
should also be more than obvious which

70
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,759
plants are males and females all of the

71
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:52,408
males better be gone by now or you have

72
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:54,719
pollinated everything and you're going

73
00:02:52,408 --> 00:02:57,418
to have a seeded crop so all of the

74
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:59,188
males are gone at this point at this

75
00:02:57,419 --> 00:03:01,200
point your buds are starting to form

76
00:02:59,188 --> 00:03:02,968
you're seeing little pistol hairy

77
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:05,729
covered buds you're starting to get

78
00:03:02,968 --> 00:03:07,590
minimal bud mass at this point we are

79
00:03:05,729 --> 00:03:09,568
also coming out of that rapid stretch

80
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:11,310
phase for the first three weeks of

81
00:03:09,568 --> 00:03:13,289
flowering our plants really like to

82
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:15,449
stretch and take off that is pretty much

83
00:03:13,289 --> 00:03:17,128
over our plants are still going to get

84
00:03:15,449 --> 00:03:19,709
taller hopefully that top bud grows

85
00:03:17,128 --> 00:03:21,388
gigantic but that rapid stretch phase is

86
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:23,250
over we don't have to worry so much

87
00:03:21,389 --> 00:03:25,199
about the plants just taking off on us

88
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:26,219
anymore they're going to stop stretching

89
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:28,769
and they're going to start focusing

90
00:03:26,219 --> 00:03:31,348
their energy more on developing the fat

91
00:03:28,769 --> 00:03:33,269
chunky buds we want now at this point if

92
00:03:31,348 --> 00:03:35,578
you don't have a carbon filter it is

93
00:03:33,269 --> 00:03:37,590
really time to get a carbon filter in

94
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:39,870
your grow room if you've got any air

95
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:42,120
exiting the grow going outside that the

96
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:44,158
neighbors may smell you need a carbon

97
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,650
filter by now things are going to start

98
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:49,108
getting really aromatic from here on out

99
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:51,359
it is only going to get worse so keep

100
00:03:49,109 --> 00:03:53,699
your odor under control I've said it

101
00:03:51,359 --> 00:03:55,979
before a very common way for your garden

102
00:03:53,699 --> 00:03:57,900
to be discovered is for the aroma to be

103
00:03:55,979 --> 00:03:59,609
noticed by a neighbor the neighbors call

104
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,199
the police the police drive around the

105
00:03:59,609 --> 00:04:02,909
block they narrow it down they knock on

106
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:04,560
your door by the time they hit the front

107
00:04:02,908 --> 00:04:06,448
porch they can smell it they know it's

108
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,280
you they come knock on the door if you

109
00:04:06,449 --> 00:04:09,989
were in a legal state they want to count

110
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,579
your plants it's still a pain in the ass

111
00:04:09,989 --> 00:04:14,069
you've got law enforcement in the house

112
00:04:11,579 --> 00:04:16,709
in the Gros it's stressful if you are in

113
00:04:14,068 --> 00:04:18,149
a non legal area if whoever shows up at

114
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:19,680
your front door feels that they have got

115
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:21,658
probable cause to come into your house

116
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,939
they can come they can discover your

117
00:04:21,658 --> 00:04:25,560
grow you may be handy with the laws you

118
00:04:23,939 --> 00:04:26,779
may speak well you may know how to keep

119
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,269
them out of the house for now

120
00:04:26,779 --> 00:04:30,529
but if the aroma was strong enough if

121
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:32,389
their suspicion was strong enough

122
00:04:30,529 --> 00:04:34,069
they're going to contact the judge they

123
00:04:32,389 --> 00:04:35,810
will have a warrant and in several days

124
00:04:34,069 --> 00:04:38,089
they will be back they'll pull off the

125
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:39,949
front door it will come in armed it will

126
00:04:38,089 --> 00:04:42,409
be scary as [ __ ] it will destroy your

127
00:04:39,949 --> 00:04:45,139
entire garden and ask questions later so

128
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:47,270
now is the time to have a carbon filter

129
00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:49,310
always be thinking about safety and

130
00:04:47,269 --> 00:04:52,039
security if you were growing an illegal

131
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:53,720
or non legal state you probably don't

132
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:55,669
even notice how pungent your garden is

133
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:57,770
because you're there every day but the

134
00:04:55,668 --> 00:04:59,299
first time the mailman walks in front of

135
00:04:57,769 --> 00:05:01,639
the house and catches a little whiff

136
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:03,980
he's going to know exactly what that is

137
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:06,709
the first time a little bit of aroma

138
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:09,050
wafting a and hits your neighbor right

139
00:05:06,709 --> 00:05:12,319
in her nose she's going to know exactly

140
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:14,418
what that aroma is immediately in this

141
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:16,310
scenario we are only four weeks into

142
00:05:14,418 --> 00:05:19,310
flower and our plants are beginning to

143
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:21,800
stink it is only going to get worse by

144
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:23,660
week seven eight and nine it is going to

145
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,639
be pungent as soon as we start

146
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:28,220
harvesting these plants and trimming the

147
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:30,680
plants that aroma is going to increase

148
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:32,930
exponentially don't add that extra

149
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:34,668
stress to yourself by stinking up the

150
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:36,680
entire neighborhood with your grow I

151
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:38,810
understand that buying a carbon filter

152
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:40,699
and an extraction fan sound like just

153
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:42,620
another expense to a new grower but I

154
00:05:40,699 --> 00:05:45,079
would much rather invest that money in a

155
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:47,360
filter and a blower than my lawyer and

156
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:49,490
bail alright I feel like I've made my

157
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,080
point it is time for a carbon filter if

158
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:53,180
you don't have one now it is time to

159
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:55,519
start taking the steps to get a carbon

160
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:57,050
filter in your garden all right I feel

161
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:59,478
like that's a good overview of what's

162
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:01,189
going on in the garden buds are showing

163
00:05:59,478 --> 00:06:03,649
the stretch phase is over and it is

164
00:06:01,189 --> 00:06:05,870
starting to stink now let's talk about

165
00:06:03,649 --> 00:06:09,319
the environment in our grow four weeks

166
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:11,209
four five and six let's start with

167
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:13,849
temperature for a daytime temperature

168
00:06:11,209 --> 00:06:16,430
four weeks four five and six I would

169
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:18,560
suggest a range of 70 to 80 degrees

170
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:19,970
Fahrenheit now if you can dial it in a

171
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,870
little tighter I would like to be

172
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:25,820
between 74 and 77 degrees now during the

173
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:29,000
night I would suggest a temperature in

174
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:30,589
the range of 60 to 70 degrees if you can

175
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,459
dial it in nice and tight I would

176
00:06:30,589 --> 00:06:36,918
recommend 65 to 68 degrees again I'm

177
00:06:34,459 --> 00:06:38,899
going to suggest no more than a 10

178
00:06:36,918 --> 00:06:40,060
degree difference in your day and night

179
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:41,469
temperature

180
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:44,199
what that means is if your day

181
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:46,870
temperature is 77 degrees you don't want

182
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:48,819
your night temperature any lower than 67

183
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:51,600
degrees we don't want to see any more

184
00:06:48,819 --> 00:06:54,279
than a 10 degree diurnal temperature

185
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:56,200
variation if we allow drastic

186
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:57,939
temperature drops in the night cycle we

187
00:06:56,199 --> 00:07:00,219
will slow down the plant growth and we

188
00:06:57,939 --> 00:07:02,620
will also encourage powdery mildew

189
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:05,080
development so again during the day we

190
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:07,870
want to be between 70 and 80 degrees at

191
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:10,779
night we want to be between 60 and 70

192
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:13,240
degrees now as time goes on we are going

193
00:07:10,779 --> 00:07:14,978
to want to reduce the temperature of the

194
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,478
grow room later in Flour

195
00:07:14,978 --> 00:07:18,789
we want to make the room a little bit

196
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:21,250
cooler so if you are struggling to get

197
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:23,860
the room to 74 at this point maybe just

198
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:26,139
keep it up there at 78 79 degrees so

199
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:27,850
that when weeks 8 &amp; 9 come around we can

200
00:07:26,139 --> 00:07:29,680
reduce that temperature down to as low

201
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:32,500
as you can get it if the lowest you can

202
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:35,199
get it is 74 let's wait until weeks 8 &amp;

203
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:37,269
9 to get it there and leave it around 77

204
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,918
now now I know a lot of people are going

205
00:07:37,269 --> 00:07:41,049
to say why do we want to make it cooler

206
00:07:38,918 --> 00:07:43,599
there are several reasons think about a

207
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:46,150
plant outside as the seasons change it

208
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:48,039
gets colder it knows oh [ __ ] the end of

209
00:07:46,149 --> 00:07:49,929
the season is coming I need to ripen up

210
00:07:48,038 --> 00:07:51,699
I need to finish so that will encourage

211
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:53,949
the plants have finish it will also

212
00:07:51,699 --> 00:07:57,099
encourage beautiful colors it will also

213
00:07:53,949 --> 00:07:59,769
encourage more terpene production heat

214
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:01,360
and light break down terpenes so why not

215
00:07:59,769 --> 00:08:04,060
make it a little bit cooler where we can

216
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,038
preserve a little bit more Terps I also

217
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:08,139
feel that that little bit of cold toward

218
00:08:06,038 --> 00:08:11,228
the end will increase in density you

219
00:08:08,139 --> 00:08:13,599
will get tighter more dense buds it also

220
00:08:11,228 --> 00:08:15,250
will help reduce humidity and late in

221
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,900
flower we need a little bit less

222
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:18,699
humidity because we've got those big

223
00:08:16,899 --> 00:08:21,579
chunky buds and we don't want to develop

224
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:23,589
bud rot in the middle of our flowers so

225
00:08:21,579 --> 00:08:26,500
reducing the temperature later in flower

226
00:08:23,589 --> 00:08:28,359
has many advantages I understand that

227
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,889
not all rooms are set up to be able to

228
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:32,288
reduce the temperature late in flower

229
00:08:29,889 --> 00:08:33,820
you may be running a perpetual cycle you

230
00:08:32,288 --> 00:08:36,069
just simply may not have the equipment

231
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:38,140
to get it that cool and flower it is not

232
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:40,060
a requirement it is just a little bonus

233
00:08:38,139 --> 00:08:42,879
it's a little tip and trick that may

234
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:46,028
help increase aroma and color and

235
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:48,070
density and also help you avoid powdery

236
00:08:46,028 --> 00:08:50,230
mildew and botrytis toward the end of

237
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:52,810
your flowering phase so that is why I

238
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:53,920
suggest reducing the temperature late in

239
00:08:52,809 --> 00:08:55,778
flower we will

240
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:58,208
talk more about that as we move through

241
00:08:55,778 --> 00:09:01,389
these grow lessons now let's talk about

242
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:04,049
humidity for weeks 4 5 &amp; 6

243
00:09:01,389 --> 00:09:06,579
I suggest 40 percent relative humidity

244
00:09:04,049 --> 00:09:07,899
we have reduced the humidity by 10

245
00:09:06,578 --> 00:09:09,399
percent from last week

246
00:09:07,899 --> 00:09:11,769
we don't need as much moisture in the

247
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:13,750
air we're starting to develop buds those

248
00:09:11,769 --> 00:09:15,698
buds act like sponges they will gather

249
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:17,679
all of that moisture in the air which

250
00:09:15,698 --> 00:09:19,539
will lead to Boyte Rytas which is our

251
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:22,120
worst nightmare when we get giant buds

252
00:09:19,539 --> 00:09:23,799
in a commercial facility so let's reduce

253
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:26,470
the humidity let's get it down to about

254
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:30,578
40 percent now let's talk a little bit

255
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:33,160
about nutrients for weeks 4 5 &amp; 6 I know

256
00:09:30,578 --> 00:09:34,719
I don't give detailed information when I

257
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:36,909
talk about nutrients in these grow

258
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,800
lessons that's because I don't know what

259
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:40,419
brand of nutrients you were using I

260
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:41,679
don't know if you're using bottles I

261
00:09:40,419 --> 00:09:43,179
don't know if you're using powdered

262
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:45,338
nutrients I don't know if you're running

263
00:09:43,179 --> 00:09:47,708
organics I have no idea what you have

264
00:09:45,339 --> 00:09:49,990
chosen to do I can't be too specific

265
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:52,629
with the nutrient suggestions what I can

266
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:55,180
do is make sure we cover the bases and I

267
00:09:52,629 --> 00:09:57,100
give you a solid foundation so here are

268
00:09:55,179 --> 00:10:01,448
the things I would make sure to have in

269
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:03,399
my nutrient mix 4 weeks 4 5 &amp; 6 if you

270
00:10:01,448 --> 00:10:06,370
were running bottles you need a basic

271
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:08,139
bloom nutrient you may have a bottle

272
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:09,940
that says bloom you may have a bottle

273
00:10:08,139 --> 00:10:12,370
that says bloom a-and a bottle that says

274
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:14,380
bloom B those bottles are what we need

275
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:16,149
for this stage of flowering you'll

276
00:10:14,379 --> 00:10:18,278
notice that those bottles have three

277
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:20,799
numbers printed on them that is an NPK

278
00:10:18,278 --> 00:10:22,929
value at this stage of flowering we do

279
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:24,939
not need a lot of nitrogen we just need

280
00:10:22,929 --> 00:10:27,549
a lot of nitrogen to provide energy to

281
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:29,740
the plants at this stage of flowering we

282
00:10:27,549 --> 00:10:31,838
need more phosphorus and potassium than

283
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:34,269
we have previously needed in the grow so

284
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:36,430
you will see a low n number and higher P

285
00:10:34,269 --> 00:10:39,009
and K value numbers on your bloom

286
00:10:36,429 --> 00:10:41,318
nutrient bottles so if you're growing

287
00:10:39,009 --> 00:10:43,689
with bottles hopefully your bloom base

288
00:10:41,318 --> 00:10:46,448
has covered your nitrogen phosphorus and

289
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:48,610
potassium you will also need cal-mag at

290
00:10:46,448 --> 00:10:51,549
this phase of the game I also recommend

291
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:54,009
enzymes and microbes I would also

292
00:10:51,549 --> 00:10:54,519
introduce a kelp product to my feeding

293
00:10:54,009 --> 00:10:56,708
regimen

294
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:58,509
I think kelp has a lot of great benefits

295
00:10:56,708 --> 00:11:01,179
that we will talk about in a future

296
00:10:58,509 --> 00:11:04,269
episode this is also a great time to

297
00:11:01,179 --> 00:11:05,649
start introducing a bloom booster again

298
00:11:04,269 --> 00:11:07,080
I don't know what products you're using

299
00:11:05,649 --> 00:11:09,990
I don't know what brand you have

300
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:12,540
most bottled nutrients offer a very

301
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:14,310
obvious bloom booster now is the time to

302
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:16,439
start implementing that into your

303
00:11:14,309 --> 00:11:17,969
feeding schedule if you really want to

304
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,860
provide energy to your plants you can

305
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:21,750
feed them a carbohydrate product at this

306
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:23,279
stage of flowering the carbohydrates

307
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:24,899
will give the plants energy and the

308
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:27,449
carbohydrates will also feed your

309
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:29,279
microbes if you are growing with veg

310
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:31,200
bloom powdered nutrients I would have

311
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:33,809
added shine by now I definitely would

312
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,850
put shine in there by week three now is

313
00:11:33,809 --> 00:11:38,069
basically the time I start tapering off

314
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:40,259
the microbe products and start adding in

315
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:42,480
the bloom booster products the roots

316
00:11:40,259 --> 00:11:43,649
should be big and fat and healthy by the

317
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,389
time the plant is done

318
00:11:43,649 --> 00:11:47,220
I want that plant to be nearly root

319
00:11:45,389 --> 00:11:49,470
bound so we are well on our way to

320
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:51,120
filling that pot with roots now I want

321
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:53,670
to start focusing on moving that energy

322
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,529
up top and making big giant buds so

323
00:11:53,669 --> 00:11:57,449
through weeks four five and six I start

324
00:11:55,529 --> 00:12:00,750
tapering off the microbes and I start

325
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:02,550
increasing the bloom booster product now

326
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:04,830
be careful with your bloom boosters a

327
00:12:02,549 --> 00:12:07,679
lot of people want to overfeed the bloom

328
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:10,980
booster most bottled nutrient companies

329
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:13,589
have a very clear suggested dose printed

330
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:15,269
on the bottle most of the time that is

331
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:17,580
too much they want you to feed your

332
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:19,949
plants too much so that you have to buy

333
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:22,259
more of their product more frequently I

334
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:24,720
would suggest that a new grower starts

335
00:12:22,259 --> 00:12:27,480
off with 50% of the recommended bloom

336
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,190
booster dosage the first time you add

337
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:31,800
that bloom booster to your plant feed

338
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:34,590
only put 50% of the recommended dosage

339
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:36,449
and see how the plants respond if the

340
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:38,519
plants don't show any sign of burn or

341
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:40,770
stunted growth maybe increase the

342
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:42,779
feeding just a little bit next time and

343
00:12:40,769 --> 00:12:45,029
increase it until you see the leaf tips

344
00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:46,139
just barely burn I like to call it

345
00:12:45,029 --> 00:12:47,279
getting their nails done because it

346
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:48,210
starts to look like the end of the

347
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,949
fingers are just getting their

348
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:51,690
fingernails on there when you see them

349
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:52,860
starting to get their nails done that's

350
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:54,360
when you know you're pushing them to

351
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:56,279
their limit and they're just starting to

352
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,899
get burned you can either give them that

353
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:59,789
much again and just keep burning them

354
00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:02,220
just a little bit or you can reduce it a

355
00:12:59,789 --> 00:13:03,990
little bit but do not go any harder with

356
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:06,420
the bloom booster once you see the

357
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:08,279
fingernails start happening now it

358
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:10,169
sounds natural and feels natural to want

359
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:12,299
to add more bloom booster that's going

360
00:13:10,169 --> 00:13:14,279
to give you bigger fatter buds that's

361
00:13:12,299 --> 00:13:16,500
what everybody wants but there is a

362
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:18,809
point of diminishing returns if you add

363
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:20,549
too much it will burn the plant once the

364
00:13:18,809 --> 00:13:20,939
plants begin to burn it will start to

365
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:22,829
lock

366
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:24,480
nutrients once they lock out nutrients

367
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:26,129
it will not take any of your bloom

368
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,470
booster then it all becomes a waste of

369
00:13:26,129 --> 00:13:30,720
money and you have a shitty harvest so

370
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:32,550
don't be that guy don't over bloom boost

371
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,590
your plants five or six weeks into

372
00:13:32,549 --> 00:13:36,389
flower and completely burn them and make

373
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:38,220
them look like [ __ ] and ruin your crop

374
00:13:36,389 --> 00:13:40,889
when you've only got three weeks to go

375
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:43,200
now those are just the basic nutrients I

376
00:13:40,889 --> 00:13:45,689
would recommend if you were growing from

377
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:48,030
bottled nutrients every company is going

378
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:49,890
to have other products to offer some

379
00:13:48,029 --> 00:13:51,659
companies may offer a silicate product

380
00:13:49,889 --> 00:13:52,379
some companies may offer a terpene

381
00:13:51,659 --> 00:13:54,179
enhancer

382
00:13:52,379 --> 00:13:56,009
some companies may recommend a bud

383
00:13:54,179 --> 00:13:58,079
hardener I'm not sure what company you

384
00:13:56,009 --> 00:13:59,370
have chosen but be careful when adding

385
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:01,889
your additives and just pay attention

386
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:04,049
when mixing make sure that your pH is

387
00:14:01,889 --> 00:14:07,350
correct and tried to make note of your

388
00:14:04,049 --> 00:14:08,909
EC or your PPM's if possible now if you

389
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:10,320
were growing with organics if you're

390
00:14:08,909 --> 00:14:11,850
growing with super soil you have

391
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,440
probably mixed up your soil at the

392
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:15,330
beginning and there's not a lot you can

393
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,820
do to it at this point other than adding

394
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:20,550
teas or maybe adding a cover crop or

395
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:21,900
possibly a top dress to be quite honest

396
00:14:20,549 --> 00:14:24,269
with you that is not my area of

397
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:26,009
expertise if you are growing organically

398
00:14:24,269 --> 00:14:27,990
and you want to boost up your plants a

399
00:14:26,009 --> 00:14:30,720
little bit I would probably suggest a

400
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:32,460
compost tea that included worm castings

401
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,340
and it would probably include some sort

402
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:37,980
of guano but again I am NOT the organic

403
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:40,200
expert I am NOT the no-till guy I am NOT

404
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:42,090
a super soil guy I honestly grow in a

405
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:44,520
commercial environment and I grow from

406
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:45,990
bottle and powdered nutrients most of

407
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:48,539
the advice and guidance that I give you

408
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:51,269
on this show will be based on bottled or

409
00:14:48,539 --> 00:14:53,699
powdered nutrients so I feel like that

410
00:14:51,269 --> 00:14:56,730
covers the basics of nutrients for weeks

411
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:59,610
4 5 &amp; 6 basically we want to give them a

412
00:14:56,730 --> 00:15:02,370
solid NPK a little bit of cal-mag some

413
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:04,440
enzymes some microbes some carbs I would

414
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:06,629
introduce kelp I would introduce a bloom

415
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:08,280
booster and basically at this point I

416
00:15:06,629 --> 00:15:10,169
would start reducing the microbe

417
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:12,209
products and I would start replacing the

418
00:15:10,169 --> 00:15:14,759
microbes with a bloom booster product

419
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:16,650
over the next couple of weeks all right

420
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:18,450
now I feel like we know what type of

421
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:20,220
environment to keep these plants in I

422
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:21,870
feel like we know how to feed them we

423
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:23,850
know what's going on in the grow now

424
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:25,950
what can we do to these plants to

425
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:27,600
increase production what can we do to

426
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:29,550
make sure they stay healthy and pest

427
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,830
free all the way up to the end of the

428
00:15:29,549 --> 00:15:34,079
flowering cycle one thing we need to

429
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:34,720
keep in mind is that we need to be very

430
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:37,720
soul

431
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:39,790
effective on sprays this late in Flour I

432
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:42,278
would prefer not to spray anything at

433
00:15:39,789 --> 00:15:44,318
all on these plants but if we do run

434
00:15:42,278 --> 00:15:47,169
into issues there are very limited

435
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:50,078
options of products we can use to spray

436
00:15:47,169 --> 00:15:52,479
on these plants so let's do our best at

437
00:15:50,078 --> 00:15:54,669
this point to keep bugs out of the grow

438
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,709
room we should already be implementing

439
00:15:54,669 --> 00:15:59,049
an integrated pest management system

440
00:15:56,708 --> 00:16:01,359
which includes a spray rotation and

441
00:15:59,049 --> 00:16:03,789
possible release of predator bugs

442
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,740
I would also avoid going to other

443
00:16:03,789 --> 00:16:07,419
gardens if you have friends that grow I

444
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:09,639
would stay away from their grow

445
00:16:07,419 --> 00:16:12,399
I would also never take anybody else

446
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:14,470
into my grow especially other friends

447
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:17,500
that grow you are inviting their spider

448
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:19,839
mites right into your garden also change

449
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:21,188
clothes if you go to another grow if you

450
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,050
work in a commercial grow and have a

451
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:24,909
private grow at home change clothes

452
00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:27,429
between those grows I would also

453
00:16:24,909 --> 00:16:29,169
recommend changing clothes between stops

454
00:16:27,429 --> 00:16:31,000
at the gross store and going to your

455
00:16:29,169 --> 00:16:33,429
garden don't go straight from the hydro

456
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,438
shop to your garden you are picking [ __ ]

457
00:16:33,429 --> 00:16:37,208
up at the gross store all day long all

458
00:16:35,438 --> 00:16:39,519
of the dirty growers are going there all

459
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:42,969
the soil is being shipped there that is

460
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:44,438
a hotbed for pests don't take your pests

461
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:46,389
from the gross store right to your

462
00:16:44,438 --> 00:16:48,938
garden I would also recommend a

463
00:16:46,389 --> 00:16:50,980
dedicated pair of shoes for the garden

464
00:16:48,938 --> 00:16:53,049
or for the grow room if you work in

465
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:55,420
multiple facilities I would have a pair

466
00:16:53,049 --> 00:16:57,039
of shoes for the grow at work I would

467
00:16:55,419 --> 00:16:58,750
have a pair of shoes that I wore after

468
00:16:57,039 --> 00:17:00,399
work then I would have a different pair

469
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:02,679
of shoes that I put on to go in my

470
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:05,078
personal garden also if you have an

471
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:08,438
outdoor grow and an indoor grow change

472
00:17:05,078 --> 00:17:10,720
clothes and shoes between those Gardens

473
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:12,819
it sounds really tedious and it sounds

474
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:15,189
like overkill but we do not want to

475
00:17:12,818 --> 00:17:17,889
spread spider mites from one Garden to

476
00:17:15,189 --> 00:17:19,538
another the most obvious and easy way

477
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:22,360
for mites to spread is for them to

478
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:24,609
travel on a grower so let's do our best

479
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:26,859
as responsible growers as responsible

480
00:17:24,609 --> 00:17:29,319
farmers to not spread spider mites to

481
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:31,509
our other grows and to our friends grows

482
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:34,089
it's pretty easy to get rid of spider

483
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:35,558
mites early in flower and veg but it is

484
00:17:34,089 --> 00:17:37,869
a pain in the ass to get rid of spider

485
00:17:35,558 --> 00:17:40,178
mites late in bloom so let's not drag

486
00:17:37,869 --> 00:17:41,859
them into the bloom room if you do have

487
00:17:40,179 --> 00:17:44,470
multiple rooms or multiple facilities

488
00:17:41,859 --> 00:17:48,309
and you do find a pest issue in one area

489
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:50,170
treat that area as a contaminated space

490
00:17:48,309 --> 00:17:52,419
notify everybody that works there hey

491
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:55,060
there are spider mites in here don't go

492
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:56,950
in here unless it is required then if

493
00:17:55,059 --> 00:17:58,899
you do have to go in that area make sure

494
00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:00,970
you change clothes before entering

495
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:02,170
another grow area and carrying those

496
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:04,990
spider mites throughout the facility

497
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:07,120
with you if you have one room that is

498
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:08,799
not infested with mites and you have

499
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:11,349
another room that is infested with mites

500
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:13,299
work on the cleanroom first when you get

501
00:18:11,349 --> 00:18:15,159
to work do all the work that needs to be

502
00:18:13,299 --> 00:18:17,559
done in there close that room up and be

503
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:19,240
done then go to that spider mite room do

504
00:18:17,559 --> 00:18:21,819
your work in there and then when you're

505
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:23,680
done leave the grow facility remove your

506
00:18:21,819 --> 00:18:25,299
clothes clean them put them in the

507
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:28,299
laundry and don't take those dirty

508
00:18:25,299 --> 00:18:30,279
clothes back into that cleanroom work on

509
00:18:28,299 --> 00:18:32,349
the cleanroom first then work on the

510
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:34,720
dirty rooms last so that we don't drag

511
00:18:32,349 --> 00:18:36,759
those spider mites into the room that is

512
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,829
clean and if you know that one room is

513
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:41,559
contaminated and you have to go in there

514
00:18:38,829 --> 00:18:43,689
I would almost suggest a lab coat or a

515
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:45,609
Tyvek suit that you can swap between

516
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:47,620
rooms if you've got to go into the

517
00:18:45,609 --> 00:18:49,539
meited room throw on the lab coat throw

518
00:18:47,619 --> 00:18:51,609
on the Tyvek suit go into the spider

519
00:18:49,539 --> 00:18:53,680
matted room do what you need to do come

520
00:18:51,609 --> 00:18:56,379
out of that room remove the lab coat or

521
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:58,509
Tyvek suit replace it with a fresh lab

522
00:18:56,380 --> 00:19:01,030
coat or Tyvek suit and then go into the

523
00:18:58,509 --> 00:19:02,710
room that you need to work in next again

524
00:19:01,029 --> 00:19:04,690
I know this sounds tedious I know this

525
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:07,090
sounds like overkill but imagine if

526
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:08,860
you've got 500 plants in one room and

527
00:19:07,089 --> 00:19:10,839
you're expecting to harvest over a

528
00:19:08,859 --> 00:19:12,729
hundred pounds and we distract spider

529
00:19:10,839 --> 00:19:14,740
mites into their from the other room now

530
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:15,849
we've got one room that is almost ready

531
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:17,799
to harvest and we've been fighting

532
00:19:15,849 --> 00:19:19,299
spider mites it's almost gone we're

533
00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:21,190
almost through that battle but guess

534
00:19:19,299 --> 00:19:23,289
what you just walked into the other room

535
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:24,940
and we're five weeks into flower and you

536
00:19:23,289 --> 00:19:26,619
just dropped a spider mite bomb in there

537
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:29,200
because you were lazy and didn't bother

538
00:19:26,619 --> 00:19:31,119
to change your lab coat small problems

539
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,250
are small problems when there are small

540
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:35,619
problems but when we go to a large scale

541
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:38,289
cultivation facility a very small

542
00:19:35,619 --> 00:19:40,359
problem will multiply overnight those

543
00:19:38,289 --> 00:19:41,740
spider mites are going to have a party

544
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:43,449
when we turn off the lights and

545
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:45,609
everybody goes home you will come in the

546
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:48,130
next morning and now it is spider mite

547
00:19:45,609 --> 00:19:49,750
world so let's do our best to not

548
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:52,000
introduce spider mites to the grow

549
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:53,680
because we are very limited on plans of

550
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,750
attack to get rid of those mites in this

551
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:58,420
point of the game there are very limited

552
00:19:55,750 --> 00:20:01,720
sprays we can apply one thing we can do

553
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:02,500
we can release predator bugs now if you

554
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,940
are planning ahead

555
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:07,329
part of your integrated pest management

556
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:09,779
system did include ordering creditor

557
00:20:07,329 --> 00:20:12,369
bugs to be released early in Flour

558
00:20:09,779 --> 00:20:14,710
hopefully around week three you released

559
00:20:12,369 --> 00:20:16,989
an army of predator bugs so now if any

560
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:19,059
spider mites do show up those predators

561
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:21,069
are already colonized they're already

562
00:20:19,059 --> 00:20:24,069
there claiming their turf and no spider

563
00:20:21,069 --> 00:20:25,659
mites will start infesting your grow now

564
00:20:24,069 --> 00:20:27,669
if you didn't get those predator bugs in

565
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:29,620
there early it is not too late to order

566
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:31,870
predators to come attack your spider

567
00:20:29,619 --> 00:20:34,000
mite infestation but you need to act

568
00:20:31,869 --> 00:20:35,979
quickly don't say I'll order them Monday

569
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,369
when you see spider mites in the grow

570
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:41,289
order those predator mites today when

571
00:20:39,369 --> 00:20:42,729
that box of predator mites comes you

572
00:20:41,289 --> 00:20:44,769
need to stop what you were doing and

573
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:47,650
release those bugs into the garden

574
00:20:44,769 --> 00:20:49,329
immediately we need to win the war we

575
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:51,220
need to release our troops to get in

576
00:20:49,329 --> 00:20:52,929
there and destroy those spider mites

577
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:54,819
that are sucking the juices out of our

578
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:57,039
plants they are destroying our potency

579
00:20:54,819 --> 00:20:59,589
and they are diminishing our yields we

580
00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:01,629
need to get rid of them immediately so

581
00:20:59,589 --> 00:21:03,970
if it's too late to spray I highly

582
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:06,280
suggest you order predator bugs order

583
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:08,289
more than you think you need we want a

584
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:10,649
large army to get in there and wipe out

585
00:21:08,289 --> 00:21:13,180
the infestation as quickly as possible

586
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:15,100
now earlier I did say we are very

587
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:17,410
limited on the products we can spray to

588
00:21:15,099 --> 00:21:19,869
our plants this late in Flour there are

589
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:21,580
a few beneficial fungus based products

590
00:21:19,869 --> 00:21:23,559
that can be applied to the plants this

591
00:21:21,579 --> 00:21:26,230
late in flower that will not affect the

592
00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:28,539
taste if you understand the products you

593
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:31,360
were using you can apply a sprayed

594
00:21:28,539 --> 00:21:33,700
pesticide and you can release predators

595
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:36,669
and they will work together the proper

596
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:39,039
pesticide at this stage of the game will

597
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:41,680
not harm your flowers and it will not

598
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:43,930
kill your predators again I do not

599
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:46,630
suggest spraying plants with bulky

600
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:48,910
flowers but sometimes something has to

601
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:51,700
be done we do have a few spray

602
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:54,640
application options do not spray

603
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:57,670
anything oil-based this late in flower

604
00:21:54,640 --> 00:22:00,490
it will ruin the flavor and aroma of

605
00:21:57,670 --> 00:22:02,980
your plants the only things I would

606
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:06,279
recommend to spray this late in flower

607
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:08,920
would be beneficial fungus type products

608
00:22:06,279 --> 00:22:11,139
I would never apply an oil this late in

609
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:13,900
flower and I don't even want to spray

610
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:15,940
them unless it is absolutely necessary

611
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:17,528
I would rather release the Predators

612
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:19,778
and let them do their thing but I

613
00:22:17,528 --> 00:22:21,819
understand sometimes you're going to go

614
00:22:19,778 --> 00:22:23,740
into panic mode sometimes it's more than

615
00:22:21,819 --> 00:22:25,178
what the Predators can handle sometimes

616
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:27,190
you may have already purchased the

617
00:22:25,179 --> 00:22:29,379
pesticide and you don't have funding to

618
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:31,690
order insects I do understand that

619
00:22:29,378 --> 00:22:33,069
things come up in a garden and life does

620
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:35,590
happen and we can't always control

621
00:22:33,069 --> 00:22:38,259
things one thing we can do from this

622
00:22:35,589 --> 00:22:40,449
situation is take note we can try to

623
00:22:38,259 --> 00:22:42,190
understand how did we get spider mites

624
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:44,558
and how can we prevent this from

625
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:47,048
happening next time so it is time to

626
00:22:44,558 --> 00:22:50,349
stop spraying the plants it is also time

627
00:22:47,048 --> 00:22:51,878
to stop running the sulfur burner if

628
00:22:50,349 --> 00:22:53,918
you've got a sulfur burner in your grow

629
00:22:51,878 --> 00:22:55,898
turn that [ __ ] off it is making your

630
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:58,750
plants taste terrible it is making your

631
00:22:55,898 --> 00:23:00,518
concentrates taste terrible let's stop

632
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:02,679
using sulfur burners in the grow and

633
00:23:00,519 --> 00:23:04,569
let's start correcting the true issue

634
00:23:02,679 --> 00:23:06,759
what is causing the powdery mildew

635
00:23:04,569 --> 00:23:08,950
people use sulfur to prevent and cure

636
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:11,169
powdery mildew how about we find the

637
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:13,210
cause instead of burning sulfur in the

638
00:23:11,169 --> 00:23:15,820
room and making the room smell like [ __ ]

639
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:17,440
making your bud smell like [ __ ] making

640
00:23:15,819 --> 00:23:19,329
your concentrates smell like [ __ ] making

641
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,808
the final product completely taste like

642
00:23:19,329 --> 00:23:21,369
[ __ ]

643
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:23,798
let's find out what's causing that

644
00:23:21,369 --> 00:23:26,109
powdery mildew and cure that instead of

645
00:23:23,798 --> 00:23:27,819
just burning sulfur in the room now I

646
00:23:26,109 --> 00:23:29,678
know a lot of people have a sulphur

647
00:23:27,819 --> 00:23:31,269
burner and that is their method that's

648
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:33,250
how they learn that's what they're going

649
00:23:31,269 --> 00:23:35,769
to do they're not going to stop doing it

650
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:37,778
because I said so let's compromise if

651
00:23:35,769 --> 00:23:39,788
you insist on using a sulfur burner in

652
00:23:37,778 --> 00:23:42,730
your garden perhaps you can stop using

653
00:23:39,788 --> 00:23:45,158
it around week three or around week four

654
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:47,079
when those buds start popping up earlier

655
00:23:45,159 --> 00:23:49,330
in the episode I suggested reducing

656
00:23:47,079 --> 00:23:51,220
humidity perhaps reducing that humidity

657
00:23:49,329 --> 00:23:53,048
a little bit will help prevent that

658
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:54,669
powdery mildew since we're getting the

659
00:23:53,048 --> 00:23:56,829
fat buds we need to reduce humidity

660
00:23:54,669 --> 00:23:58,960
anyway let's get it a little cooler

661
00:23:56,829 --> 00:24:01,329
reduce humidity and stop burning that

662
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:03,038
sulfur and I'm sure the product will

663
00:24:01,329 --> 00:24:04,869
taste better if you've ever smoked to

664
00:24:03,038 --> 00:24:07,509
concentrate the taste of like fish or

665
00:24:04,869 --> 00:24:09,579
fish oil a lot of the times that is

666
00:24:07,509 --> 00:24:11,528
because there was a sulphur burner being

667
00:24:09,579 --> 00:24:14,558
used in the room during the flowering

668
00:24:11,528 --> 00:24:17,048
phase so no more sprays and no more

669
00:24:14,558 --> 00:24:19,359
sulfur burners after week three please

670
00:24:17,048 --> 00:24:21,638
so now that we are approaching week four

671
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:23,888
it is time to reduce some of the

672
00:24:21,638 --> 00:24:25,990
physical stress we have been performing

673
00:24:23,888 --> 00:24:27,878
to the plants I still want to do some

674
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:29,370
popping and twisting and I still want to

675
00:24:27,878 --> 00:24:31,259
work them into the Nets

676
00:24:29,369 --> 00:24:34,019
but I don't want to go as hard and as

677
00:24:31,259 --> 00:24:35,700
Extreme as I was before I want to allow

678
00:24:34,019 --> 00:24:37,920
these plants to use their energy on

679
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:39,450
producing buds now and not recovering

680
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:41,160
from all the popping and breaking and

681
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:43,319
not being stressed out I want them to

682
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:45,390
just focus on making fat chunky buds and

683
00:24:43,319 --> 00:24:47,519
sweet trichomes for me so I'm going to

684
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:48,900
reduce the stress a little bit that

685
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:51,240
doesn't mean I'm gonna stop beating them

686
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:53,490
up but I am going to mellow out just a

687
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,750
little bit on these girls so we're gonna

688
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:56,759
reduce the stress we're gonna do a

689
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:58,680
little less popping and twisting but we

690
00:24:56,759 --> 00:25:00,359
are still going to pop and twist the

691
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:02,670
stems we're also going to continue

692
00:25:00,359 --> 00:25:04,379
working these plants into the trellis if

693
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:05,759
you've got a trellis net and you've got

694
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:07,770
a plant that's taken off getting too

695
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:09,569
tall don't be afraid to grab that one

696
00:25:07,769 --> 00:25:12,539
crack the stem and work it right back

697
00:25:09,569 --> 00:25:14,879
under the net the star of week 4 is also

698
00:25:12,539 --> 00:25:16,859
a good time to do our final bottoming

699
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,330
we've got those little bud sets showing

700
00:25:16,859 --> 00:25:19,769
we know where the buds are gonna be if

701
00:25:18,329 --> 00:25:21,629
you've got a stick with a bunch of

702
00:25:19,769 --> 00:25:23,639
little tiny shitty buds on it just clean

703
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:25,290
those little popcorn balls right on off

704
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:27,390
and leave that stuff at the end of the

705
00:25:25,289 --> 00:25:29,759
branch to develop into a nice chunky bud

706
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:31,620
in a previous episode I talked about

707
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:33,750
taking off all those little tiny sucker

708
00:25:31,619 --> 00:25:35,549
buds you can leave the thick branches

709
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:36,990
but those little buds that grow off the

710
00:25:35,549 --> 00:25:39,419
base of that branch toward the bottom

711
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:41,250
those can get cut off if they're just a

712
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:42,779
waste of space and energy and they're

713
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:43,740
not going to produce anything except

714
00:25:42,779 --> 00:25:45,539
their pain in the ass

715
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:47,789
you can cut those right off of the plant

716
00:25:45,539 --> 00:25:49,289
some growers like to say that's what I

717
00:25:47,789 --> 00:25:50,250
was going to make concentrate out of

718
00:25:49,289 --> 00:25:52,109
that's what I was going to make my

719
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:53,970
edibles out of that's fine if you want

720
00:25:52,109 --> 00:25:55,619
to leave that there I feel like if you

721
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:57,779
cut that stuff off that doesn't get a

722
00:25:55,619 --> 00:25:59,279
lot of light you take that energy and

723
00:25:57,779 --> 00:26:01,259
you move it right up to the top of the

724
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:03,000
plant instead of the plant feeding those

725
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:04,740
twelve little tiny [ __ ] buds at the

726
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,359
bottom it can just put that energy right

727
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:07,950
up at the top where it's getting light I

728
00:26:06,359 --> 00:26:09,959
can use that energy to make that top

729
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:12,420
Cola that much beefier that much fatter

730
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:13,890
and it also sucks to trim that bottom

731
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:15,720
stuff nobody wants to trim those little

732
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:17,670
popcorn buds nobody wants to waste time

733
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:19,079
cutting that off and if you can cut

734
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:21,120
something off to make something better

735
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:23,490
why wouldn't you do it so now is a good

736
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:25,049
time to go do a final bottoming just

737
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:27,509
clean up that messy crap on the bottom

738
00:26:25,049 --> 00:26:30,329
that's not going to turn into any usable

739
00:26:27,509 --> 00:26:33,750
bud now I also like to do a light

740
00:26:30,329 --> 00:26:36,539
defoliation at this point any leaf with

741
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:38,069
a purple petiole will get taken off at

742
00:26:36,539 --> 00:26:40,019
this point in time so if you've got a

743
00:26:38,069 --> 00:26:41,879
big leaf it's got a purple stem you can

744
00:26:40,019 --> 00:26:43,230
see that long purple stem just go ahead

745
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:44,940
and break that off break that

746
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:46,558
I'm off as close to the branch as close

747
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:47,640
to the butt as you can so you don't

748
00:26:46,558 --> 00:26:49,319
leave that little stand there with

749
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:51,270
moisture hanging out just break that

750
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:53,579
stem right off get those leaves out of

751
00:26:51,269 --> 00:26:55,889
the room we don't need all the excessive

752
00:26:53,579 --> 00:26:57,960
leaves so anything with the purple stem

753
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:59,790
I'll go kind of light I'll do one layer

754
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:01,019
I'll look at the room I'll say yeah I

755
00:26:59,789 --> 00:27:02,579
can do more and then I'll go back and

756
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:04,230
take off more leaves and then I'll stand

757
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:05,879
back and look into the room and I just

758
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:07,650
try to make sure that I've gotten all

759
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:09,780
the giant leaves that are blocking the

760
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:11,610
light from hitting the buds if there if

761
00:27:09,779 --> 00:27:13,289
I can see light coming down and it's

762
00:27:11,609 --> 00:27:15,240
hitting a leaf and I can clearly see

763
00:27:13,289 --> 00:27:17,009
that that leaf is hanging over a bud

764
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:19,259
site I will remove that leave so that

765
00:27:17,009 --> 00:27:20,970
bud site can get the light now a lot of

766
00:27:19,259 --> 00:27:22,710
old-school growers are going to tell you

767
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:24,120
don't remove the leaves because that's

768
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:26,429
where the nutrients and sugars are

769
00:27:24,119 --> 00:27:27,989
stored but I'm pretty sure earlier in

770
00:27:26,429 --> 00:27:30,090
this episode we talked about feeding

771
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:31,890
these plants a whole bunch of nutrients

772
00:27:30,089 --> 00:27:33,839
there's not really a reason for these

773
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:35,280
plants to store nutrients we are feeding

774
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:36,839
the [ __ ] out of them these are high

775
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:39,058
performance plants that are going to get

776
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:41,099
a high performance meal every day they

777
00:27:39,058 --> 00:27:43,558
don't need that stored stuff we can pull

778
00:27:41,099 --> 00:27:46,019
those leaves off those leaves will give

779
00:27:43,558 --> 00:27:48,149
us opportunity for powdery mildew those

780
00:27:46,019 --> 00:27:50,429
leaves are places for pests to hide

781
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:52,530
those leaves have to come off when we

782
00:27:50,429 --> 00:27:54,540
trim anyway why not take those leaves

783
00:27:52,529 --> 00:27:56,548
off now and save us the trouble

784
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:59,039
now don't go extreme and make the plants

785
00:27:56,548 --> 00:27:59,579
naked take off the leaves with the giant

786
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:01,500
pea Deol's

787
00:27:59,579 --> 00:28:03,210
and the leaves that are in the way this

788
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:05,250
is kind of intimidating for new growers

789
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:07,019
and honestly this is an art and a skill

790
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:09,720
that you will have to develop over time

791
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:11,639
a good way to practice defoliating and

792
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:13,650
seeing what happens to the plants is to

793
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:15,360
get four plants of the same thing so

794
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:16,919
you've got four clones of let's say

795
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:18,449
golden go you got four golden goat

796
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:20,490
plants they're all in the same room

797
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:23,669
they're all in the same environment why

798
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:26,130
not defoliate one really hard defoliate

799
00:28:23,669 --> 00:28:27,990
one kind of hard be fully eight one a

800
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:29,970
little bit and then don't be fully eight

801
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:32,220
the other one at all then take pictures

802
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:34,079
if you can and take as many notes as you

803
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:36,750
can and then keep an eye on those notes

804
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:38,789
and pictures and see which plant came

805
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:40,650
out the best did the plant that you left

806
00:28:38,789 --> 00:28:42,149
alone come out the best did the plant

807
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:43,769
that we beat to [ __ ] and almost made it

808
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:45,360
naked come out the best or was it the

809
00:28:43,769 --> 00:28:48,150
one that's right in the middle it's

810
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:51,089
going to be strange specific on how hard

811
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:53,610
you want to go with defoliation but most

812
00:28:51,089 --> 00:28:55,918
strains will benefit from a medium

813
00:28:53,609 --> 00:28:56,699
defoliation and they will definitely

814
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:58,530
benefit from

815
00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:01,140
removing all those super large leaves

816
00:28:58,529 --> 00:29:02,970
that are blocking your bud sites now if

817
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:05,340
you go too hard your plants will look

818
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:07,380
naked and the growth will stop you'll

819
00:29:05,339 --> 00:29:10,079
just slow them down so don't go

820
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:12,060
extremely hard on your first defoliation

821
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:13,919
kind of practice going there and pull

822
00:29:12,059 --> 00:29:15,809
off some leaves I like to say this in

823
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:17,759
the podcast all the time you can take

824
00:29:15,809 --> 00:29:20,460
more off but you can never glue those

825
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:22,799
leaves back on so pull a few off take a

826
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:24,660
step back look at it see what you think

827
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:26,099
if you want to take off more get in

828
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:28,290
there and take them off if you're

829
00:29:26,099 --> 00:29:30,929
intimidated by it leave the leaves there

830
00:29:28,289 --> 00:29:33,299
one thing I will suggest is that if a

831
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:35,310
leaf is yellow or funky you remove it

832
00:29:33,299 --> 00:29:37,319
don't hesitate and don't be shy

833
00:29:35,309 --> 00:29:39,500
to take down the ugly leaves those need

834
00:29:37,319 --> 00:29:42,480
to go those yellow leaves are

835
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:43,920
invitations for pests a spider mite will

836
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,049
see a yellow leaf and they will head

837
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:48,120
right to that leaf because it is weak

838
00:29:46,049 --> 00:29:50,009
the outer layer isn't as thick and

839
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:51,629
crunchy so that spider mite can get its

840
00:29:50,009 --> 00:29:53,369
shitty little fangs right through that

841
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:55,110
skin and it can get right in there and

842
00:29:53,369 --> 00:29:56,849
start sucking the juice it doesn't have

843
00:29:55,109 --> 00:29:58,859
to deal with that thick healthy plant

844
00:29:56,849 --> 00:30:01,230
flesh so get rid of those yellow leaves

845
00:29:58,859 --> 00:30:04,019
and remove them from the garden as soon

846
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:05,940
as possible something else I would

847
00:30:04,019 --> 00:30:08,250
suggest at this point in flowering is to

848
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:10,019
increase air flow it may be a good time

849
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:11,579
to add some fans to the room if you

850
00:30:10,019 --> 00:30:13,619
don't have an oscillating fan in the

851
00:30:11,579 --> 00:30:16,139
room now is the time we want those

852
00:30:13,619 --> 00:30:18,659
leaves rustling we don't want those buds

853
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:21,330
sitting still and letting stagnant air

854
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:22,980
build up in those buds now we don't want

855
00:30:21,329 --> 00:30:24,929
the plants being bent over and getting

856
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:27,420
[ __ ] whipped by the fan all day we just

857
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:29,310
want every leaf to rustle occasionally

858
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:30,630
you just want that fan to pass by and

859
00:30:29,309 --> 00:30:32,700
just give those leaves just a little

860
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:34,560
rustle just move the air around just

861
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:37,319
stir the air just so that nothing can

862
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:38,879
get still just move that air I just keep

863
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:40,769
doing this motion with my hand like you

864
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:43,080
guys can see me just move in that air

865
00:30:40,769 --> 00:30:44,910
but like I said earlier our buds are

866
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:46,799
going to start developing they're going

867
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:48,690
to start getting fat and chunky those

868
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:50,460
buds work like sponges if there's too

869
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:52,410
much moisture in the air that moisture

870
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:54,630
will get trapped inside those buds then

871
00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:56,640
we'll start getting bud mold inside the

872
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:58,770
bud if you've got a fan moving that air

873
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:01,710
and moisture around that will reduce the

874
00:30:58,769 --> 00:31:03,629
opportunities for bud mold now that

875
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:06,120
you're adding fans you may need to add

876
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:07,830
some sticks or some sort of cages for

877
00:31:06,119 --> 00:31:09,750
supports if you're not using a trellis

878
00:31:07,829 --> 00:31:11,029
net your buds are going to start

879
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:12,859
toppling over

880
00:31:11,029 --> 00:31:14,750
let's not wait till weeks five and six

881
00:31:12,859 --> 00:31:16,609
when those buds are big and chunky and

882
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:18,380
sticky and they're falling over trying

883
00:31:16,609 --> 00:31:20,779
to break the sticks let's get some

884
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:22,820
steaks let's get some tomato cages let's

885
00:31:20,779 --> 00:31:24,678
start supporting these plants early if

886
00:31:22,819 --> 00:31:25,819
you've got a big long branch and you can

887
00:31:24,679 --> 00:31:28,009
tell that it's going to turn into a

888
00:31:25,819 --> 00:31:29,960
giant bud go ahead and stick a long

889
00:31:28,009 --> 00:31:31,910
steak into the pot stick it into the

890
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:33,259
soil try not to cut up too many of the

891
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:35,029
roots it's going to happen

892
00:31:33,259 --> 00:31:37,069
I understand but shove that steak

893
00:31:35,029 --> 00:31:38,359
straight into the soil get that stick

894
00:31:37,069 --> 00:31:41,298
straight up sticking where you need it

895
00:31:38,359 --> 00:31:43,490
then use a twisty tie or a zip tie or

896
00:31:41,298 --> 00:31:45,980
something gentle to just gently attach

897
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:47,630
that top elyse stick to that branch you

898
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:49,490
don't want to squeeze that branch at all

899
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:51,500
it needs to be loose so that you don't

900
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:52,970
pinch that branch you want some freedom

901
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:55,819
in there but you don't want it flopping

902
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:58,429
around too much don't pinch or crush or

903
00:31:55,819 --> 00:32:00,769
squeeze the branch at all be very gentle

904
00:31:58,429 --> 00:32:02,030
so use a few steaks and stick them in

905
00:32:00,769 --> 00:32:03,950
the dirt and have them sticking straight

906
00:32:02,029 --> 00:32:06,500
up and attach those floppy branches to

907
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:08,750
those steaks as needed don't be shy I've

908
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:10,970
seen people use a [ __ ] ton of steaks in

909
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:13,069
each pot if that's what you've got to do

910
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:15,558
that's what you've got to do to keep

911
00:32:13,069 --> 00:32:17,689
that plant upright so get some sticks or

912
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:20,269
get some tomato cages and be prepared to

913
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:22,130
start supporting your plants I hope your

914
00:32:20,269 --> 00:32:23,929
buds get so chunky that those plants

915
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:25,940
just want to fall right over that's what

916
00:32:23,929 --> 00:32:28,220
I hope for you but I also hope you've

917
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:30,410
got some sticks or a tomato cage on hand

918
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:32,569
so that those plants don't die when that

919
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:34,160
[ __ ] starts happening so we've got some

920
00:32:32,569 --> 00:32:36,349
airflow we've got some sticks on our

921
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:39,290
plants another thing we need to focus on

922
00:32:36,349 --> 00:32:41,329
is to continue scouting for pests and

923
00:32:39,289 --> 00:32:43,548
p.m. just because we're this late and

924
00:32:41,329 --> 00:32:44,298
flower doesn't mean that problems can't

925
00:32:43,548 --> 00:32:46,190
arise

926
00:32:44,298 --> 00:32:48,918
keep your eyes open for pests and

927
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:50,330
powdery mildew and boy try this now

928
00:32:48,919 --> 00:32:52,640
while we're scouting for pass and boy

929
00:32:50,329 --> 00:32:55,069
Titus we also need to pay attention to

930
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:57,290
plant problems do you see any nutrient

931
00:32:55,069 --> 00:32:59,539
burn do you see any pH issues pay

932
00:32:57,289 --> 00:33:01,428
attention to the leaves a few crunchy

933
00:32:59,539 --> 00:33:03,259
leaves here and there that's acceptable

934
00:33:01,429 --> 00:33:04,940
a few shitty leaves low in the canopy

935
00:33:03,259 --> 00:33:07,460
that's acceptable if you start getting

936
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:09,380
large clusters of shitty looking leaves

937
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:11,509
you've got a problem that needs to be

938
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:12,770
addressed hopefully you were taking

939
00:33:11,509 --> 00:33:13,279
notes of what you've been feeding the

940
00:33:12,769 --> 00:33:14,779
plant

941
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:16,428
hopefully you've got some kind of record

942
00:33:14,779 --> 00:33:18,470
of what the pH was that was going into

943
00:33:16,429 --> 00:33:20,540
the plants and maybe you've even been

944
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:22,039
taking notes of what is coming out of

945
00:33:20,539 --> 00:33:24,170
the plants have you been measuring the

946
00:33:22,039 --> 00:33:26,210
EC and pH of your runoff

947
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:29,600
if so that will help you diagnose

948
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:31,009
problems if a problem should arise now

949
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:32,509
while you're scouting for pests and

950
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:34,609
while you're looking for nutrient issues

951
00:33:32,509 --> 00:33:36,799
also don't forget about all of the

952
00:33:34,609 --> 00:33:38,389
equipment in the grow room just do some

953
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:40,970
visual inspections while you're walking

954
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:43,340
through the room listen look you may

955
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:45,920
notice things always be paying attention

956
00:33:43,339 --> 00:33:47,869
to the plants and the equipment while

957
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:50,150
you're in the grow now while you're

958
00:33:47,869 --> 00:33:51,799
looking around for equipment problems

959
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:53,150
you're looking around for pests and

960
00:33:51,799 --> 00:33:55,250
we're also looking around for yellow

961
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:57,710
leaves we still need to keep our eyes

962
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:59,450
out for hermaphrodites if you are

963
00:33:57,710 --> 00:34:01,910
growing from seed it is still an

964
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:04,309
opportunity to reveal hermaphroditic

965
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:07,190
traits this far into flower so keep your

966
00:34:04,309 --> 00:34:08,630
eyes out for her flowers and I think

967
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:10,460
we've talked a little bit in a previous

968
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:12,619
episode about what to do if you do

969
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:14,329
discover a hermaphroditic plant this

970
00:34:12,619 --> 00:34:16,909
late into flower you've got several

971
00:34:14,329 --> 00:34:18,590
options you can pull out the flowers you

972
00:34:16,909 --> 00:34:20,539
can cut off the main bud that's got the

973
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:22,940
male flowers on it you can cut down the

974
00:34:20,539 --> 00:34:24,829
whole plant or you can choose to ignore

975
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:26,510
the immediate threat and you can keep an

976
00:34:24,829 --> 00:34:28,699
eye on that male flower and see if it

977
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:31,190
opens and drops pollen just keep in mind

978
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:33,139
that if you do see male flowers you do

979
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:35,389
run the risk of having pollen in that

980
00:34:33,139 --> 00:34:37,879
grow room and at this point of flowering

981
00:34:35,389 --> 00:34:40,940
those female plants are really eager to

982
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:42,710
receive that pollen and create seeds so

983
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:45,440
keep your eye open because it is not too

984
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:47,179
late to find hermaphrodites in fact that

985
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:49,369
is always the case keep your eyes open

986
00:34:47,179 --> 00:34:51,769
through the entire grow on your first or

987
00:34:49,369 --> 00:34:53,480
second run with the new cultivar or if

988
00:34:51,769 --> 00:34:55,219
you're growing from seed all right

989
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:56,960
podcast world this episode is starting

990
00:34:55,219 --> 00:34:59,119
to get long so let's start recapping and

991
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:01,309
start wrapping up the episode let's

992
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:02,719
recap week 4 and week 4 we are going to

993
00:35:01,309 --> 00:35:05,179
continue working the plants into the

994
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:06,769
Nets we're going to continue popping and

995
00:35:05,179 --> 00:35:08,750
twisting we're going to bottom the

996
00:35:06,769 --> 00:35:11,480
plants a little more and now is the time

997
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:13,579
to put on sticks or tomato cages we need

998
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:15,619
to reduce the stress of the plants and

999
00:35:13,579 --> 00:35:17,509
start letting the buds develop but we

1000
00:35:15,619 --> 00:35:19,849
still need to work the plants and pop

1001
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:22,280
the stems and be foliate a little bit

1002
00:35:19,849 --> 00:35:23,659
then we'll work into week five that is

1003
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:25,580
what we're going to do our final

1004
00:35:23,659 --> 00:35:27,619
bottoming we need to finish bottling the

1005
00:35:25,579 --> 00:35:29,599
plants by the end of week five we will

1006
00:35:27,619 --> 00:35:31,069
do our final popping and twisting then

1007
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:33,529
we're going to let the plants just

1008
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:35,840
settle in and develop buds we will do

1009
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:37,519
our final major defoliation we will

1010
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:38,000
continue to lightly be fully through

1011
00:35:37,519 --> 00:35:40,070
harvest

1012
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,590
but this is the last big defoliation we

1013
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:44,300
will do we will also pull all of the

1014
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:46,280
shitty leaves we'll take off all the

1015
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:47,420
small popcorn buds any branches that

1016
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:49,730
don't look like they're worth the [ __ ]

1017
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:51,740
will get taken out at this time now is

1018
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:53,150
the last chance to get supports on these

1019
00:35:51,739 --> 00:35:55,250
buds if you don't have some sticks or

1020
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:57,289
some tomato cages in there now by week

1021
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:58,820
five you are going to see problems in

1022
00:35:57,289 --> 00:36:00,829
week six or plants are going to start

1023
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:02,150
toppling over so now is the time to get

1024
00:36:00,829 --> 00:36:03,980
in there and make sure you've got sticks

1025
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:06,440
and some sort of twisty tie or something

1026
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:08,990
like that holding your buds up it is

1027
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:10,880
also time to increase air flow we are

1028
00:36:08,989 --> 00:36:12,709
going to start gettin chunky buds so if

1029
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,930
you don't have the air flow moving now

1030
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:17,059
is the time to do it we also need a

1031
00:36:14,929 --> 00:36:19,219
carbon filter in week four I forgot to

1032
00:36:17,059 --> 00:36:21,679
recap that we need that carbon filter I

1033
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:23,869
feel like I covered that very well now

1034
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:25,669
in week six we are going to need that

1035
00:36:23,869 --> 00:36:27,980
air flow you better have those sticks

1036
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:30,440
and supports done we are done bottoming

1037
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:32,630
we are done working we are done cracking

1038
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:34,849
popping and twisting these plants it is

1039
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:37,700
time to let them grow and let the buds

1040
00:36:34,849 --> 00:36:39,559
get fat staying on top of scouting for

1041
00:36:37,699 --> 00:36:41,569
problems we need to look for bugs we

1042
00:36:39,559 --> 00:36:44,090
need to look for powdery mildew we need

1043
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:45,640
to look for hermaphrodites we also need

1044
00:36:44,090 --> 00:36:48,950
to pay attention to environmental

1045
00:36:45,639 --> 00:36:50,569
nutrient or pH stresses and if we see

1046
00:36:48,949 --> 00:36:53,389
anything caused by those things we need

1047
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:55,580
to adjust accordingly now my favorite

1048
00:36:53,389 --> 00:36:57,589
part about weeks five and six this is

1049
00:36:55,579 --> 00:36:59,150
when the good photos happen those buds

1050
00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:01,460
are starting to get chunky the buds are

1051
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:03,590
nice and fluffy all of the pistols are

1052
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:05,780
still nice and white all the leaves are

1053
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:08,390
still lush and green now is a great time

1054
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:10,070
to start taking photos so that is my

1055
00:37:08,389 --> 00:37:11,960
favorite part of week six

1056
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:13,370
so when week four you got little nugs

1057
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:15,349
you've got those little popcorn balls

1058
00:37:13,369 --> 00:37:17,029
developing then in week five you're

1059
00:37:15,349 --> 00:37:18,469
starting to get actual buds you can see

1060
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:20,570
the buds growing up the stick they're

1061
00:37:18,469 --> 00:37:23,449
starting to get chunky then in week six

1062
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:25,010
you actually start developing photogenic

1063
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:26,419
colas it's time to get in there and

1064
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:27,800
start taking pictures you're seeing some

1065
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:29,990
beef you're starting to get some good

1066
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:32,150
colors the trichomes are coming in week

1067
00:37:29,989 --> 00:37:34,939
six is when it really starts getting

1068
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:37,250
exciting now the thing to think about is

1069
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:39,559
keeping these plants healthy pest free

1070
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:42,260
problem free all the way till the end

1071
00:37:39,559 --> 00:37:44,539
keep yourself out of trouble don't brag

1072
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:46,220
don't start posting photos just yet if

1073
00:37:44,539 --> 00:37:48,949
you do take a sweet-ass photo in week

1074
00:37:46,219 --> 00:37:50,659
six I suggest you save it until harvest

1075
00:37:48,949 --> 00:37:51,469
then start flooding the pictures out

1076
00:37:50,659 --> 00:37:53,449
after Harv

1077
00:37:51,469 --> 00:37:55,250
that way nobody knows when you're

1078
00:37:53,449 --> 00:37:56,750
cutting down your crop that's just kind

1079
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:59,000
of a wheat grower trick from back in the

1080
00:37:56,750 --> 00:38:01,608
day another thing to start thinking

1081
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,710
about is is the next run ready we're

1082
00:38:01,608 --> 00:38:06,019
going to harvest these plants in two to

1083
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:07,490
four weeks depending on your strain do

1084
00:38:06,019 --> 00:38:10,068
you have plants lined up for the next

1085
00:38:07,489 --> 00:38:12,289
run do you have clones that are getting

1086
00:38:10,068 --> 00:38:14,449
rooted have you ordered seeds are you

1087
00:38:12,289 --> 00:38:16,400
prepared for the next run we don't want

1088
00:38:14,449 --> 00:38:18,529
to miss any time so let's get on top of

1089
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:20,389
the next run that feels like a great

1090
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:21,950
opportunity to pitch my seed vendor if

1091
