00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:02,128
number at the top of the show I'm not

23

25
00:01:03,988 --> 00:01:07,500
throwback Thursday episodes and I'm not

31
00:01:15,649 --> 00:01:19,530
by not stating a number at the top of

32
00:01:17,819 --> 00:01:21,239
the episode I do not create any

33
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:22,829
confusion and I also get to dodge all

34
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:24,780
the internet trolls do you want to tell

35
00:01:22,829 --> 00:01:26,640
me that I did something wrong so thank

36
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:28,079
you guys for joining me no matter what

37
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,030
episode number this is you guys I am

38
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:31,769
dabbing on some concentrates I want to

39
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:35,009
tell you about I have got some sour Clem

40
00:01:31,769 --> 00:01:37,199
for my friends at apothecary and it is I

41
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:39,209
don't say this word often but it's

42
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,469
[ __ ] amazed balls this concentrate is

43
00:01:39,209 --> 00:01:42,658
one of my favorites I've grabbed in a

44
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:45,209
little while this batch is super nice it

45
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:47,118
is sour Clem batter they take their

46
00:01:45,209 --> 00:01:49,829
ambrosia which is their proprietary

47
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:52,079
texture it's got crystals and terpil

48
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:53,069
liquids in it it's really nice but I

49
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,509
prefer the batter

50
00:01:53,069 --> 00:01:56,490
they take the ambrosia and then they

51
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:58,950
simply whip the [ __ ] out of it to a

52
00:01:56,489 --> 00:02:02,099
battery consistency it looks like a

53
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:04,890
little bit of a bright orange cheesecake

54
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:07,408
or bright yellow it's yellow goldish

55
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:09,049
orange cheesecake or cake batter is the

56
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:11,519
texture honestly inside this little jar

57
00:02:09,049 --> 00:02:12,689
but the smell coming out of here the

58
00:02:11,519 --> 00:02:14,099
aroma let me hold it up to the

59
00:02:12,689 --> 00:02:15,569
microphone maybe you can smell it

60
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:18,659
through the mic is that coming through

61
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:21,269
your speakers because it is delicious it

62
00:02:18,659 --> 00:02:23,549
smells so it's sour clam which tells me

63
00:02:21,269 --> 00:02:25,500
it's probably Sour Diesel and Clementine

64
00:02:23,549 --> 00:02:28,140
the Clementine comes through strong with

65
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,729
that sweetness but there's the sour

66
00:02:28,139 --> 00:02:33,208
comes through also it's like sweet and

67
00:02:29,729 --> 00:02:35,699
sour dankness it's got a hint of that

68
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:37,469
dryer sheet sort of smell and I'm sure

69
00:02:35,699 --> 00:02:39,389
you've heard me explain the smell of

70
00:02:37,469 --> 00:02:42,329
dashes dryer sheets before but that's

71
00:02:39,389 --> 00:02:44,279
true petaline is the the terpenoid that

72
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:45,390
smells like that it's a really it's a

73
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,699
good thing it smells like somebody

74
00:02:45,389 --> 00:02:50,159
wrapped a Sour Diesel nugget in a sweet

75
00:02:47,699 --> 00:02:51,509
dryer sheet smell it sounds like it may

76
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:53,549
not be the most pleasant but if you

77
00:02:51,509 --> 00:02:55,709
could smell it it is so great you guys

78
00:02:53,549 --> 00:03:00,140
this is amazing so the texture is nice

79
00:02:55,709 --> 00:03:02,400
also it's a it's a slightly firm

80
00:03:00,139 --> 00:03:04,289
Cheesecake batter is the texture over

81
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,390
here so what I like to do with it I like

82
00:03:04,289 --> 00:03:07,560
to take the sour Clem batter I like to

83
00:03:06,389 --> 00:03:09,359
take all of the batters

84
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,580
the truth and I like to dip it in the

85
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,290
high cannabinoid full-spectrum extract

86
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:15,930
crystals so I've been taking the sour

87
00:03:13,289 --> 00:03:18,959
clam and I put it in the extreme oranges

88
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:19,890
crystals and that is a super great dad

89
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,300
that's why I'm in such a good mood

90
00:03:19,889 --> 00:03:23,250
that's why I'm all rambling I hope you

91
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:25,170
guys are in a good mood also I hope

92
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:27,209
you're listening if I'm rambling I hope

93
00:03:25,169 --> 00:03:30,208
you're listening is that some [ __ ] it is

94
00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:32,250
now it's my podcast can make up words if

95

100
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,739

101
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,599

102
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:48,269

00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:52,409
genetics drops so check them out at dank

104
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:55,289

105
00:03:52,409 --> 00:03:57,780
I recently found out that the crew at

106
00:03:55,289 --> 00:03:59,669
rare dankness listens to the growth from

107
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,840
your heart podcast in their facility

108
00:03:59,669 --> 00:04:02,369
while they're working I don't know if

109
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,390
they're listening in the grow I don't

110
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:04,349
know if they're listening in the trim

111
00:04:03,389 --> 00:04:05,789
area I don't know if they're listening

112
00:04:04,348 --> 00:04:07,469
in the package area I don't know if it's

113
00:04:05,789 --> 00:04:09,929
being played in the retail area but

114
00:04:07,469 --> 00:04:12,329
wherever it is being played I am honored

115
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:15,180
thank you guys the rare dankness

116
00:04:12,329 --> 00:04:17,100
facility is the most impressive most

117
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:19,798
well thought out most well-designed and

118
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:21,000
most well-run facility in Colorado in my

119
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:22,560
opinion to the best of my knowledge

120
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,538
there may be something bigger better

121
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,250
badder shinier out there but I don't

122
00:04:24,538 --> 00:04:27,750
know what it is I haven't seen or heard

123
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:30,389
of it yet so somebody pointed out to me

124
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:32,850
so I can be [ __ ] amazed but they're

125
00:04:30,389 --> 00:04:34,529
listening to my podcast in that facility

126
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:37,500
and that means a lot to me it means a

127
00:04:34,529 --> 00:04:39,418
lot because Scott is a pioneer Scott is

128
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:41,339
a leader in the industry and if his crew

129
00:04:39,418 --> 00:04:42,689
is listening to me that means I'm doing

130
00:04:41,339 --> 00:04:44,099
something right because they've got all

131
00:04:42,689 --> 00:04:47,038
the knowledge they need at their

132
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:49,680
fingertips Scott is a weed wizard Scott

133
00:04:47,038 --> 00:04:51,389
is every bit as qualified to educate and

134
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,310
talk about cannabis as myself if not

135
00:04:51,389 --> 00:04:54,990
more Scott used to be on the forums

136
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:57,300
Scott's wife used to be on the forums

137
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:58,530
and I used to read their posts and learn

138
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,600
from them I'm sure they were reading

139
00:04:58,529 --> 00:05:02,759
mine and learning from me as well but I

140
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,379
was learning from Scott and now Scott is

141
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:06,389
Scott's crew I don't know if Scott's

142
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:08,668
doing it personally but Scott's crew is

143
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:10,379
listening to my podcast and Scott's grow

144
00:05:08,668 --> 00:05:12,509
so that's an honor to me that means a

145
00:05:10,379 --> 00:05:14,159
lot to me I'll quit gushing and rambling

146
00:05:12,509 --> 00:05:17,038
about it but huge shout out to everybody

00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:58,288
review some of your best practices keep

166
00:05:56,339 --> 00:06:00,659
twisting them dreads and smokin the

167
00:05:58,288 --> 00:06:03,839
bread thanks brother then he signs the

168
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:08,099
email chef dho of cut of cush culinary

169
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:09,810
in Los Angeles so chef dho is correct I

170
00:06:08,098 --> 00:06:11,819
have talked about mixing different

171
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:14,579
pesticides and different beneficials

172
00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:17,159
into a sprayer and applying them at one

173
00:06:14,579 --> 00:06:20,788
time that's called the tank mix um that

174
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:22,550
is very doable very reliable it's

175
00:06:20,788 --> 00:06:25,110
actually a common practice in the

176
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:26,788
agricultural world if you're really

177
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:28,830
working on keeping pests out of your

178
00:06:26,788 --> 00:06:32,219
garden the best way to do it is through

179
00:06:28,829 --> 00:06:34,439
multiple modes of attack which is using

180
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:36,360
different types of pesticides that will

181
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:37,620
attack in different directions if I stop

182
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,240
on your foot and punch you in the nose

183
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:41,728
and stab you in the stomach all at the

184
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:43,470
same time you're not sure which to block

185
00:06:41,728 --> 00:06:45,449
so if you come at your pests the same

186
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:46,919
way they're not gonna want to come

187
00:06:45,449 --> 00:06:49,470
around you need to hit them with

188
00:06:46,918 --> 00:06:51,870
multiple modes of attack and figure out

189
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:54,210
the ways to develop the least amount of

190
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:56,639
resistance the way to do that is to mix

191
00:06:54,209 --> 00:06:58,620
multiple things into a tank and spray it

192
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,269
at the same time now you can mix a lot

193
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:02,250
of different products you just have to

194
00:07:00,269 --> 00:07:04,439
be careful and make sure that you're not

195
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:07,019
going to cause a chemical reaction so

196
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:08,879
before you mix anything into a tank okay

197
00:07:07,019 --> 00:07:11,728
let me let me back up before you even

198
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:14,728
start playing with pesticides read the

199
00:07:11,728 --> 00:07:15,779
label carefully on every pesticide you

200
00:07:14,728 --> 00:07:18,300
are going to use

201
00:07:15,779 --> 00:07:20,069
read the application rates read about

202
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:23,069
the personal protective equipment that

203
00:07:20,069 --> 00:07:25,978
is required that stuff is very serious

204
00:07:23,069 --> 00:07:27,899
ask Elijah Elijah was exposed to a

205
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:30,060
pesticide and his whole body broke out

206
00:07:27,899 --> 00:07:31,949
in hives and he was itchy and he had a

207
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:34,699
fever and he looked uncomfortable and

208
00:07:31,949 --> 00:07:36,199
scared that was a very minor exposure

209
00:07:34,699 --> 00:07:38,209
we don't know what the long-term effects

210
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:40,039
of that exposure was it happened

211
00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:41,779
immediately he touched the pesticide the

212
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:43,790
[ __ ] grew on his skin it went [ __ ]

213
00:07:41,779 --> 00:07:45,169
crazy we don't know if something's gonna

214
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:45,980
come up in the future from that he

215
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:48,410
should be fine

216
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:50,660
but he could have problems and we do not

217
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:52,660
know it so please be very careful with

218
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:54,740
personal protective equipment where

219
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:57,530
everything requires pants and long

220
00:07:54,740 --> 00:08:00,050
sleeves and gloves where at least that

221
00:07:57,529 --> 00:08:01,459
wear eye protection as soon as you go

222
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:02,810
before you pick up a bottle you should

223
00:08:01,459 --> 00:08:04,339
have eye protection you could not have

224
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:06,259
the lid on all the way and shake it and

225
00:08:04,339 --> 00:08:07,219
put that [ __ ] right in your eye you

226
00:08:06,259 --> 00:08:08,449
haven't even thought you were gonna

227
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:10,310
unscrew the bottle and you've already

228
00:08:08,449 --> 00:08:12,920
[ __ ] got stuff in your eyes wear eye

229
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:14,720
protection please wear extra personal

230
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:18,110
protective equipment you can't go too

231
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:20,480
far what's extra goggles a respirator a

232
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:22,939
bunny suit extra gloves how can that be

233
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:25,009
a problem cover-up excessively if you

234
00:08:22,939 --> 00:08:26,540
need to so no matter what you're mixing

235
00:08:25,009 --> 00:08:30,050
use the proper personal protective

236
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:32,450
equipment also read the label of

237
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:34,460
whatever product you were using read the

238
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:36,320
application rates read what to do if you

239
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:38,479
get it in your eyes read what to do if

240
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,580
you swallow some of it see how dangerous

241
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,259
the product you were working with is see

242
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:44,330
how toxic it is see what kind of

243
00:08:42,259 --> 00:08:46,039
problems it could cause you maybe if

244
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:47,570
you're alone in your gardening let

245
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:49,429
somebody know that you're going to apply

246
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:51,020
these pesticides and that maybe if they

247
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:52,759
don't hear from you an hour in an hour

248
00:08:51,019 --> 00:08:54,559
somebody should check on you do

249
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:56,659
something like that just to be safe

250
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:58,489
I seriously know a guy who was mixing

251
00:08:56,659 --> 00:09:02,600
his nutrients and got a product in his

252
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:04,190
eyes and had to call 911 he had to

253
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,500
unlock his phone with his thumbprint and

254
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:08,360
have Siri call 9-1-1 and come to his

255
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,950
house and help him and the first thing

256
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,450
they wanted to know was what did you get

257
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:13,610
in your eyes I was the first question

258
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:15,590
they asked and he said it's the bottle

259
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:16,700
on the counter so have the bottle if

260
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:18,139
something goes wrong don't put the

261
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:19,820
bottle away have the bottle out to where

262
00:09:18,139 --> 00:09:20,809
if something does go wrong that you can

263
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,980
get the proper help I don't want

264
00:09:20,809 --> 00:09:23,569
anything bad to happen to you but if

265
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:25,070
something does happen we want to be able

266
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:27,350
to help as quickly and effectively as

267
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:29,000
possible so have the bottle where it is

268
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:30,560
findable if you're mixing several

269
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,929
bottles leave those out until you're

270
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:34,250
done until you're I know it sounds weird

271
00:09:32,929 --> 00:09:35,329
Lee Miller done I want you to make a

272
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:36,740
mess but leave them out so you're done

273
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:38,300
in case something goes wrong somebody

274
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:39,889
could say maybe he was using this pile

275
00:09:38,299 --> 00:09:42,229
of bottles right here just trying to

276
00:09:39,889 --> 00:09:43,580
help yourself out so read the [ __ ]

277
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:45,800
label you guys that's always super

278
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:47,990
important use the proper protective

279
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:48,469
equipment now if you're going to mix

280
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:51,019
pest

281
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:53,060
sides find the application rate if it

282
00:09:51,019 --> 00:09:55,279
says use this many milliliters per

283
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:57,379
gallon pour yourself a half a gallon of

284
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:59,600
water into a container use half of that

285
00:09:57,379 --> 00:10:01,399
or half of the dosage pour it into there

286
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,649
mix it like you're supposed to give it a

287
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:05,539
couple of minutes to emulsify let it get

288
00:10:03,649 --> 00:10:07,429
in there now if you're going to add

289
00:10:05,539 --> 00:10:09,500
another pesticide or another fungicide

290
00:10:07,429 --> 00:10:11,029
apply that and half the rate that you

291
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,710
intend or at half of the dosage

292
00:10:11,029 --> 00:10:14,389
recommended on the bottle or half of

293
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:16,550
whatever you're gonna use per gallon put

294
00:10:14,389 --> 00:10:18,919
it in the half gallon of water mix it up

295
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:22,909
see if those two things do anything if

296
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:25,849
it makes gas or bubbles or sizzles or if

297
00:10:22,909 --> 00:10:26,569
it burns your lungs arise get rid of it

298
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:28,370
I don't know what you're gonna do

299
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:30,110
hopefully you're doing this outside but

300
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:31,519
get rid of it safely you don't don't

301
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:33,019
want to apply that [ __ ] to your plants

302
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,519
you've only got a half a gallon to work

303
00:10:33,019 --> 00:10:35,840
with maybe a quarter gallon is smarter

304
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:40,519
for this but I don't have a quarter

305
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:42,230
gallon container but be careful test it

306
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:45,169
before you mix it together in a large

307
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:47,090
batch you can probably mix most of your

308
00:10:45,169 --> 00:10:48,860
common pesticides together but a lot of

309
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:50,690
them are oily and it's gonna get really

310
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:53,060
thick if you go mixing a bunch of things

311
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:55,520
what this listener is asking about

312
00:10:53,059 --> 00:10:57,049
mainly he said remember me talking about

313
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,600
mixing different pest control

314
00:10:57,049 --> 00:11:01,969
applications with beneficial additives I

315
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:05,870
know what you're talking about I will

316
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:08,840
mix evergreen or a Xamax and I will also

317
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:10,009
mix push from hydroponic research or veg

318
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,720
bloom it's veg bloom as they're

319
00:11:10,009 --> 00:11:13,580
accompanied and it's made by hydroponic

320
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:16,879
research I all mix push in there with my

321
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:18,200
pesticides um I will do and now this is

322
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:20,240
where you have to read you have to read

323
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:22,400
the program or the product label and see

324
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,080
if there's something in your sprint your

325
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,610
one product that is going to destroy the

326
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,530
other product let's talk about powdery

327
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:28,940
mildew this is a very good example that

328
00:11:27,529 --> 00:11:30,990
I can come up with off the top of my

329
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:33,450
head powdery mildew

330
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:36,629
early in Flour I would spray powdery

331
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:38,339
mildew with cease and double nickel

332
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:40,230
those would be my two go-to products to

333
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:42,060
take down powdery mildew cease and

334
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:44,430
double nickel this is great information

335
00:11:42,059 --> 00:11:46,979
write this down if you'd like I would do

336
00:11:44,429 --> 00:11:49,679
45 milliliters of cease per gallon and

337
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:51,930
45 milliliters of double nickel per

338
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:53,429
gallon and I would spray it and I would

339
00:11:51,929 --> 00:11:54,899
use kind of an aggressive I use a paint

340
00:11:53,429 --> 00:11:56,939
sprayer and I would put it at sort of an

341
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:58,019
aggressive setting and try to hose the

342
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,850
[ __ ] out of the plants and knock that

343
00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:01,769
p.m. off and also be straight and leave

344
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:03,089
so what the cease and the nickel are

345
00:12:01,769 --> 00:12:05,129
doing is they are beneficial bacteria

346
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:06,959
that will leave a layer on the plants

347
00:12:05,129 --> 00:12:09,600
and disrupt the growth of the powdery

348
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:11,849
mildew these beneficial bacteria do not

349
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,110
harm the plants or people and they won't

350
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:14,399
cause the problems that the powdery

351
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:16,620
mildew will cause and they will not

352
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:19,470
allow the powdery mildew to colonize on

353
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:21,269
your plants so you're applying bacterias

354
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:23,490
that are helpful and they will destroy

355
00:12:21,269 --> 00:12:26,850
the bacteria we do not want there okay

356
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:28,649
now later in Flour you're gonna if the

357
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:30,690
powdery mildew gets thicker you're gonna

358
00:12:28,649 --> 00:12:34,528
want to use a product called zero tall

359
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:37,170
zero tall is it's a mixture of basically

360
00:12:34,528 --> 00:12:39,059
vinegar and hydrogen peroxide and it

361
00:12:37,169 --> 00:12:42,149
smells like dirty feet and [ __ ] and

362
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:44,429
a gym and it's disgusting but it

363
00:12:42,149 --> 00:12:46,289
dissolves powdery mildew on contact it

364
00:12:44,429 --> 00:12:48,319
has to touch the powdery mildew but it

365
00:12:46,289 --> 00:12:51,379
will dissolve it it will destroy it

366
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:54,480
unfortunately it also will destroy

367
00:12:51,379 --> 00:12:57,539
double nickel the beneficial bacteria in

368
00:12:54,480 --> 00:13:00,060
double nickel would be destroyed by zero

369
00:12:57,539 --> 00:13:03,240
tall but the beneficial bacteria in

370
00:13:00,059 --> 00:13:06,088
cease will not be destroyed by zero at

371
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:08,430
all so you can mix cease and zero tall

372
00:13:06,089 --> 00:13:10,350
in a sprayer together and apply them but

373
00:13:08,429 --> 00:13:13,199
mixing nickel and zero tall together

374
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:14,459
would be a waste of your money so those

375
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,459
are things to think about when it comes

376
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:20,009
to mixing pesticides and fungicides now

377
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:22,469
the zero tall you spray that on the

378
00:13:20,009 --> 00:13:23,789
plants and it basically destroys the

379
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:27,060
powdery mildew that's there and since

380
00:13:23,789 --> 00:13:28,649
it's a vinegar and basically hydrogen

381
00:13:27,059 --> 00:13:29,578
peroxide it's not exactly what it is but

382
00:13:28,649 --> 00:13:31,289
it's what it smells like and that's

383
00:13:29,578 --> 00:13:33,539
basically what it is since it's those

384
00:13:31,289 --> 00:13:35,429
two products they dissolve and dissipate

385
00:13:33,539 --> 00:13:37,679
and break down and disappear very

386
00:13:35,429 --> 00:13:39,509
quickly so then you can destroy the

387
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:41,370
powdery mildew with the zero tall and

388
00:13:39,509 --> 00:13:43,230
the cease application and then you can

389
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:44,610
go back in a couple of days and you can

390
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:46,528
actually apply the sea

391
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:48,659
and double nickel again to colonize and

392
00:13:46,528 --> 00:13:50,100
help keep down the powdery mildew if you

393
00:13:48,659 --> 00:13:51,689
feel as you've knocked it out with the

394
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:53,820
first zero tall application if not go

395
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:55,200
back with the zero tall maybe increase

396
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,910
it a little bit but not too much

397
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,800
I do the zero tall and the c s--

398
00:13:56,909 --> 00:14:00,509
application again and hopefully you can

399
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:01,859
get that powdery mildew under control

400
00:14:00,509 --> 00:14:03,990
but those are things you can mix

401
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:06,539
together see some double nickel you can

402
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:09,480
mix those together ah double nickel and

403
00:14:06,539 --> 00:14:11,539
zero tall wouldn't work for you see sand

404
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:14,850
zero tall that's gonna work well for you

405
00:14:11,539 --> 00:14:17,278
other pesticides that I have had good

406
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:21,570
experience tank mixing together have

407
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:24,328
been things like venerate ah double

408
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:27,209
nickel and push that is a very good

409
00:14:24,328 --> 00:14:31,019
spray for preventative for almost all

410
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:32,578
insects I also like I'm trying to give

411
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:35,310
away too many of my secrets here but I'd

412
00:14:32,578 --> 00:14:36,989
like to share some stuff okay here's a

413
00:14:35,309 --> 00:14:39,809
good example of an actual spray that I

414
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:42,120
would apply to veg plants that has a lot

415
00:14:39,809 --> 00:14:44,429
of products in it but will work for you

416
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,480
I would do

417
00:14:44,429 --> 00:14:49,500
should I tell you how many milliliters

418
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:52,170
sure 15 milliliters of Evergreen 50

419
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:55,860
milliliters of push from veg bloom

420
00:14:52,169 --> 00:14:58,889
30 milliliters of venerate 45

421
00:14:55,860 --> 00:15:02,490
milliliters of double nickel and 2 mils

422
00:14:58,889 --> 00:15:03,960
of cal-mag per gallon now I know that

423
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:05,759
sounds like a lot of products but you're

424
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:08,100
gonna be hitting pests from multiple

425
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:10,860
angles and then spray them again in a

426
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:13,409
few days and actually switch out the

427
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:16,080
Evergreen and switch that for a Xamax

428
00:15:13,409 --> 00:15:18,120
and then drop the venerate and switch it

429
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:20,460
for botanic garden max and that way you

430
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,570
were hitting at every angle and then

431
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:23,430
you're switching so you're not getting

432
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:26,490
any resistance and that's gonna take

433
00:15:23,429 --> 00:15:29,579
down just about any bug infestation in

434
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:33,360
your veg plants now we are spraying

435
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:35,820
pesticides we have got there's evergreen

436
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,169
in there which is a whatsit pyrethrins

437
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:38,280
we've got venerate in there which I

438
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:39,990
don't even remember the active

439
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:41,220
ingredient in there we've got the double

440
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:43,139
nickel which is a beneficial bacteria

441
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:45,660
which will prevent powdery mildew and

442
00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:49,350
also pisses off spider mites but then

443
00:15:45,659 --> 00:15:52,259
we're adding the push the push is a what

444
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:54,000
did you call it a beneficial additive

445
00:15:52,259 --> 00:15:56,610
the push is a beneficial additive the

446
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,590
cal-mag is also a beneficial additive so

447
00:15:56,610 --> 00:16:00,690
we're mixing those in right on in with

448
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:02,580
the pesticides when I was a new grower I

449
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:04,380
would want to spray multiple things I

450
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:06,300
was like well I want to spray my plants

451
00:16:04,379 --> 00:16:07,470
with this I don't even remember what

452
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:09,240
product it was but I was like I also

453
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:10,680
have to hit him for pesticides which

454
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,090
means I have to hit him today and

455
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:13,559
tomorrow with the full of your feed I

456
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:15,690
didn't even realize I could just tank

457
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:17,519
mix all that [ __ ] so it took a long time

458
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:19,950
for me to realize you could just mix it

459
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,449
all into one tank mix it up maybe put a

460
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:22,680
little Coco wet in there to make it

461
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:24,660
stick to the leaves a little bit better

462
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:26,699
and then just blast it on the plants all

463
00:16:24,659 --> 00:16:30,569
at one time now something you will need

464
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:32,520
to think about ah some oily products and

465
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:35,340
sulfur products will cause you problems

466
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:37,199
don't spray all of the plants right away

467
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:39,090
maybe mix up a small batch with a pump

468
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,680
sprayer with a hand sprayer and then go

469
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:42,750
spray one or two plants with your new

470
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:44,789
product and see if you're gonna destroy

471
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:47,100
anything because it is plant sensitive

472
00:16:44,789 --> 00:16:48,839
in his grow room since it if I don't

473
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:52,440
know the health of your plants that

474
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:55,329
you're starting with so be careful makes

475
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:57,220
a test batch spray a test plan

476
00:16:55,328 --> 00:16:58,719
spray your plants in the dark if you've

477
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:00,610
got one plant that you're gonna test

478
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,230
spray pull it out of the grower area get

479
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:04,390
it away from the whites spray that plant

480
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:05,828
by itself make sure you wear all the

481
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:08,319
personal protective equipment that you

482
00:17:05,828 --> 00:17:11,048
need and I highly recommend that you

483
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:13,808
write down exactly how many milliliters

484
00:17:11,048 --> 00:17:16,750
of each product that you used and write

485
00:17:13,808 --> 00:17:19,778
down the date that you applied those

486
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:21,939
products also since I'm on this trip

487
00:17:19,778 --> 00:17:24,099
think about what you're spraying I only

488
00:17:21,939 --> 00:17:25,929
apply products that are approved by the

489
00:17:24,099 --> 00:17:28,990
Colorado Department of Agriculture and

490
00:17:25,929 --> 00:17:32,380
the Colorado meb I have a personal grow

491
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:34,419
that is not part of the meed grow that I

492
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:36,250
still use those practices in any

493
00:17:34,419 --> 00:17:38,559
personal garden that I help with that I

494
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:41,470
run myself or that I set up I encourage

495
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:43,450
everybody to follow meed and Department

496
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:44,860
of Agriculture guidelines because that's

497
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:48,038
what we're going to have to do in the

498
00:17:44,859 --> 00:17:50,259
future anyway so I guess to make a long

499
00:17:48,038 --> 00:17:52,089
story short yeah you can tank mix a

500
00:17:50,259 --> 00:17:55,148
bunch of [ __ ] together just test it

501
00:17:52,089 --> 00:17:57,668
first and test it on a test plant before

502
00:17:55,148 --> 00:18:00,038
you spray the whole garden you guys I am

503
00:17:57,669 --> 00:18:03,669
NOT some sort of cannabis wizard or weed

504
00:18:00,038 --> 00:18:06,398
genius or ganja guru I have simply tried

505
00:18:03,669 --> 00:18:08,350
a lot of [ __ ] you would be amazed I post

506
00:18:06,398 --> 00:18:11,109
pictures of great things on Instagram I

507
00:18:08,349 --> 00:18:13,689
post pictures of my successes I talk

508
00:18:11,109 --> 00:18:17,528
about and brag about my wins I don't

509
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:18,759
share my losses my losses [ __ ] see

510
00:18:17,528 --> 00:18:20,470
I'm gonna leave that one right there I

511
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:23,470
don't share my losses and my failures

512
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:25,480
with you guys so you've got to keep in

513
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:27,490
mind for every three cool things you see

514
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:29,860
that I post there were probably 10 or 20

515
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:32,109
things that I [ __ ] up and that's how I

516
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:34,418
learned how to do those 3 cool things so

517
00:18:32,109 --> 00:18:37,178
don't be afraid to expand your knowledge

518
00:18:34,419 --> 00:18:39,639
by [ __ ] up a little bit if you make

519
00:18:37,179 --> 00:18:42,009
mistakes and you learn along the way and

520
00:18:39,638 --> 00:18:44,109
you are making mistakes because you're

521
00:18:42,009 --> 00:18:46,089
trying new [ __ ] you're not making

522
00:18:44,109 --> 00:18:47,859
mistakes you just haven't found the

523
00:18:46,089 --> 00:18:50,259
exact way to do what you were thinking

524
00:18:47,859 --> 00:18:51,278
of yet so if you're learning to ride a

525
00:18:50,259 --> 00:18:52,990
skateboard and you're trying to do a

526
00:18:51,278 --> 00:18:54,490
kickflip you'd have to learn how to

527
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:55,690
ollie and get that board up off the

528
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:56,919
ground and then once you got it up off

529
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:58,630
the ground you gotta learn how to flip

530
00:18:56,919 --> 00:18:59,620
it and then once you get it flipping you

531
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:02,139
gotta learn how to get your feet back on

532
00:18:59,619 --> 00:19:04,178
it and land it up those first hundred

533
00:19:02,138 --> 00:19:05,259
kick flips are gonna suck and you're not

534
00:19:04,179 --> 00:19:07,570
gonna know what you're doing but you're

535
00:19:05,259 --> 00:19:07,990
not failing you just haven't got there

536
00:19:07,569 --> 00:19:09,369
yet

537
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:11,259
you got a land one

538
00:19:09,369 --> 00:19:12,399
and then once you land one now you can

539
00:19:11,259 --> 00:19:13,119
do kick flips and now you just got to

540
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,130
perfect it

541
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:16,569
so start throwing them kick flips in the

542
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:18,730
girl you guys quit skating in straight

543
00:19:16,569 --> 00:19:20,139
lines cuz your grow is never gonna look

544
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:22,180
any different it's not gonna get any

545
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:23,860
better your skills aren't gonna advance

546
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:25,900
you're just gonna be doing the same old

547
00:19:23,859 --> 00:19:27,399
thing forever start throwing some kick

548
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:28,990
flips you're gonna crash a couple of

549
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,640
times you're gonna fall down you're

550
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:32,349
gonna get a bloody me but you know what

551
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,940
Falls what happens when you fall down

552
00:19:32,349 --> 00:19:35,769
when you're growing weed you kill a

553
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:37,299
couple plants if they're all my way you

554
00:19:35,769 --> 00:19:37,569
gotta buy more dirt if I can try it

555
00:19:37,299 --> 00:19:39,519
again

556
00:19:37,569 --> 00:19:41,868
it doesn't hurt nearly as bad is when

557
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:43,398
you crash when you're skateboarding

558
00:19:41,868 --> 00:19:45,079

dealing with this affliction I've had

585
00:20:49,579 --> 00:20:53,538
folks tell me this and that but I really

586
00:20:52,009 --> 00:20:55,308
don't trust what they've told me I've

587
00:20:53,538 --> 00:20:57,558
done some research myself but I just

588
00:20:55,308 --> 00:20:59,298
wanted to know if you know anyone

589
00:20:57,558 --> 00:21:01,848

590
00:20:59,298 --> 00:21:02,538

opportunity to help you out again

00:21:15,528 --> 00:21:19,749
because this is something a lot of

600
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:22,788
people deal with anxiety seems to be

601
00:21:19,749 --> 00:21:24,649
sweeping our nation or community or

602
00:21:22,788 --> 00:21:26,690
world everybody is getting anxious and

603
00:21:24,648 --> 00:21:28,848
why not because the world is getting

604
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:31,969
[ __ ] crazy right now I understand why

605
00:21:28,848 --> 00:21:34,489
people are anxious I'm anxious you asked

606
00:21:31,969 --> 00:21:36,259
do you know anybody personally that

607
00:21:34,489 --> 00:21:38,629
battles with this and what they use yes

608
00:21:36,259 --> 00:21:41,598
me dude I am anxious I am a nervous

609
00:21:38,628 --> 00:21:43,878
[ __ ] wreck sometimes I know why it's

610
00:21:41,598 --> 00:21:45,829
cuz I've got a brain injury ah and also

611
00:21:43,878 --> 00:21:46,538
some things in the past to give me

612
00:21:45,829 --> 00:21:49,069
anxiety

613
00:21:46,538 --> 00:21:51,288
I've got anxiety so I know how to talk

614
00:21:49,069 --> 00:21:53,928
about this before I get into

615
00:21:51,288 --> 00:21:55,150
recommending strains for your anxiety

616
00:21:53,929 --> 00:21:58,300
let me save it

617
00:21:55,150 --> 00:22:01,090
not all people have the same body

618
00:21:58,299 --> 00:22:06,279
chemistry not all strains work the same

619
00:22:01,089 --> 00:22:08,980
for all consumers I like really strong

620
00:22:06,279 --> 00:22:11,109
sativas for my anxiety but I've got a

621
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:14,799
traumatic brain injury and sometimes I

622
00:22:11,109 --> 00:22:17,139
feel like the thoughts start on side a

623
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:19,240
and just will not connect to side B and

624
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:21,190
somewhere in the middle there the

625
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:22,990
[ __ ] telephone line is just crossing

626
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:24,340
and the information is just not getting

627
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:27,700
to where it needs to be and it starts

628
00:22:24,339 --> 00:22:31,720
making me anxious and I get weird and so

629
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:36,000
I will smoke a dab of really high THC

630
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:38,620
really strong dabs and I will feel that

631
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,929
tangled telephone wire in my head I'll

632
00:22:38,619 --> 00:22:42,399
feel that [ __ ] unravel and all the

633
00:22:40,929 --> 00:22:43,720
connectors go hum now I know where I'm

634
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,160
supposed to be going and all the

635
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:47,920
information can travel down the right

636
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:50,490
pipeline so for me it's things like

637
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:53,529
lemon Jeffrey really helps out a lot

638
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:56,079
almost anything lemon flavored the lemon

639
00:22:53,529 --> 00:22:58,660
Terps really seemed to work well for

640
00:22:56,079 --> 00:23:01,509
that and orange Terps ah extreme

641
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:06,370
tangerines screamin tangerines extreme

642
00:23:01,509 --> 00:23:09,839
extreme oranges tangi ah Jillybean those

643
00:23:06,369 --> 00:23:09,839
are things that really work for me

644
00:23:11,058 --> 00:23:15,918
I've got a very dear friend who I don't

645
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:18,169
want to call them out and say their name

646
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:20,480
but somebody really close to me has an

647
00:23:18,169 --> 00:23:23,360
anxiety issue and they smoke the

648
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:25,159
Clementine and the Clementine is what

649
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:28,398
they say stops their anxiety from

650
00:23:25,159 --> 00:23:30,679
happening now those are strong sativas

651
00:23:28,398 --> 00:23:32,709
that seem to work for me and somebody

652
00:23:30,679 --> 00:23:35,809
else

653
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:37,879
I'm not sure your body chemistry

654
00:23:35,808 --> 00:23:40,608
some of those sativas are going to give

655
00:23:37,878 --> 00:23:42,978
people anxiety and if something if you

656
00:23:40,608 --> 00:23:45,888
smoke Jillybean or lemon Jeffrey or a

657
00:23:42,979 --> 00:23:48,739
Clementine or something in that realm

658
00:23:45,888 --> 00:23:49,939
and it gives you anxiety then you're

659
00:23:48,739 --> 00:23:51,979
gonna have to try something at the

660
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:55,629
opposite end of the spectrum I would try

661
00:23:51,979 --> 00:23:58,369
LA Confidential cataract cush ah

662
00:23:55,628 --> 00:24:00,108
something in that room kosher cush and

663
00:23:58,368 --> 00:24:02,178
those are all three from DNA genetics

664
00:24:00,108 --> 00:24:04,638
but they're the opposite end of the

665
00:24:02,179 --> 00:24:07,309
spectrum there gonna be more sedative

666
00:24:04,638 --> 00:24:10,248
more chill you out more relax you more

667
00:24:07,308 --> 00:24:12,558
put you on the couch kind of weed what I

668
00:24:10,249 --> 00:24:14,419
think about smoking the sativas and the

669
00:24:12,558 --> 00:24:16,759
limonene and the Turpin alene Terps

670
00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:19,129
they're so uplifting then it just

671
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:20,749
changes my mood to where I can't even be

672
00:24:19,128 --> 00:24:22,848
anxious I'm just in a good mood and my

673
00:24:20,749 --> 00:24:25,038
mind is firing so fast that I can't

674
00:24:22,848 --> 00:24:27,079
stick to an anxious thought that's just

675
00:24:25,038 --> 00:24:28,368
fresh like oh good mood well I was

676
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:30,558
anxious oh no I'm not I'm in a good mood

677
00:24:28,368 --> 00:24:32,509
I'm so high off this lemon Jeffrey dab

678
00:24:30,558 --> 00:24:35,418
that I'm in a good mood and so that it's

679
00:24:32,509 --> 00:24:38,210
just motivating and uplifting I feel on

680
00:24:35,419 --> 00:24:40,700
the lemon Jeffrey Jillybean tangi

681
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:43,129
Clementine a lot of strains like that

682
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:45,240
the fruity orange II kind of things work

683
00:24:43,128 --> 00:24:47,579
with my anxiety

684
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:49,079
some folks are gonna need that indica

685
00:24:47,579 --> 00:24:52,980
stuff and I'll repeat those strains I

686
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:56,099
said kosher cush I said what else did I

687
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:58,230
say cataract cush

688
00:24:56,099 --> 00:25:00,990
and LA Confidential are the three from

689
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:02,700
DNA genetics that I think would work for

690
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:03,929
you if the other end of the spectrum

691
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:07,650
doesn't work now you've got another

692
00:25:03,929 --> 00:25:11,460
option if the sativa and indica 's don't

693
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:14,038
work for you you can try CBD you can

694
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:16,319
find CBD isolates or you can find CBD

695
00:25:14,038 --> 00:25:20,099
heavy flowers strains that may be heavy

696
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:23,939
and CBD are Tora Bora and Pennywise

697
00:25:20,099 --> 00:25:27,359
those are two really popular CBD strains

698
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:29,640
also there's the ACDC which is really

699
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:31,678
popular for being a CBD strain I'm sure

700
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:34,409
there are more out there things evolve

701
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:37,048
everyday but you can get CBD isolates

702
00:25:34,409 --> 00:25:39,090
you can get CBD flowers you can get high

703
00:25:37,048 --> 00:25:41,788
CBD concentrates you can get CBD

704
00:25:39,089 --> 00:25:43,408
teachers you can get CBD everything you

705
00:25:41,788 --> 00:25:45,658
can imagine just make sure it's coming

706
00:25:43,409 --> 00:25:47,760
from a source that is reputable and it's

707
00:25:45,659 --> 00:25:50,039
actually CBD and not some imported

708
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:51,690
Chinese fish oil because you don't want

709
00:25:50,038 --> 00:25:54,720
to take random chemicals from other

710
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:56,490
countries get some quality [ __ ] but so

711
00:25:54,720 --> 00:26:00,058
those are things I would recommend and I

712
00:25:56,490 --> 00:26:01,650
know that that is not a direct science

713
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:02,940
or a prescription but that's the thing

714
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:05,100
about cannabis and that's the thing

715
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:06,538
about our bodies and that's one of my

716
00:26:05,099 --> 00:26:08,788
favorite things about medicating with

717
00:26:06,538 --> 00:26:11,339
cannabis is when you go to the doctor

718
00:26:08,788 --> 00:26:14,788
they say you've got this condition you

719
00:26:11,339 --> 00:26:17,189
take this pill this often at this rate

720
00:26:14,788 --> 00:26:19,408
and they think it's gonna work based on

721
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:20,880
everybody else's body and yes most of

722
00:26:19,409 --> 00:26:22,919
those prescriptions will work at that

723
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,360
rate at that dosage at that interval

724
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:26,059
because they've done science to figure

725
00:26:24,359 --> 00:26:28,619
that out cannabis doesn't work that way

726
00:26:26,058 --> 00:26:30,869
the thing about cannabis is we cannot

727
00:26:28,619 --> 00:26:33,329
you can't kill yourself with cannabis so

728
00:26:30,869 --> 00:26:34,949
you are able to be your own guinea pig

729
00:26:33,329 --> 00:26:38,308
and find out your thresholds you can

730
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:41,250
find out I need six dabs every 22

731
00:26:38,308 --> 00:26:43,649
minutes and I need to smoke a sativa and

732
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:45,990
you can administer your medicine to

733
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:48,450
yourself and you can perfect your

734
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:50,400
regimen and you won't kill yourself and

735
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:52,700
you can stay pain-free or anxiety free

736
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,538
or whatever free and you can be happy

737
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:56,700
that's one of the greatest things about

738
00:26:54,538 --> 00:26:58,740
cannabis the downfall to that is I can't

739
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:00,269
tell you smoke a quarter gram dab of

740
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:01,740
jellybeans every two hours you're gonna

741
00:27:00,269 --> 00:27:03,389
have to dial that in yourself which

742
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:04,829
means unfortunately maybe you're gonna

743
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:06,210
go smoke some lemon Jeffrey and it's

744
00:27:04,829 --> 00:27:07,769
gonna [ __ ] you up and give you the worst

745
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:08,710
panic attack and I'm sorry if that's

746
00:27:07,769 --> 00:27:11,259
what has to happen

747
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:13,240
but remember that and then don't ever

748
00:27:11,259 --> 00:27:16,480
smoke limit Geoffrey again if that's the

749
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:18,849
case then smoke LA Confidential and see

750
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:21,519
if it helps see if it is if the LA

751
00:27:18,849 --> 00:27:23,139
Confidential makes you lazy or lethargic

752
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:24,369
or maybe it makes you creative and

753
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:26,049
psychedelic and puts you in a good mood

754
00:27:24,369 --> 00:27:27,158
but you're gonna have to try a couple

755
00:27:26,048 --> 00:27:28,658
things at the opposite ends of the

756
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:30,789
spectrum and see what works for you I

757
00:27:28,659 --> 00:27:32,440
wish I knew your body chemistry better I

758
00:27:30,788 --> 00:27:35,769
wish I knew exactly what to recommend

759
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:37,419
I've believed that in the future once we

760
00:27:35,769 --> 00:27:39,339
figure out what we like I know what I

761
00:27:37,419 --> 00:27:41,350
like I know my favorite Terps I know how

762
00:27:39,339 --> 00:27:42,730
much THC I like I don't know exactly but

763
00:27:41,349 --> 00:27:45,099
I mean I have a good idea of what I like

764
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:46,509
from the labeling that I've experienced

765
00:27:45,099 --> 00:27:47,949
and from the consuming that I've

766
00:27:46,509 --> 00:27:48,669
experienced I've got a good idea of what

767
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:51,399
works for me

768
00:27:48,669 --> 00:27:54,009
I believe in the future we'll be able to

769
00:27:51,398 --> 00:27:56,678
go to our dispensary and we'll say hey

770
00:27:54,009 --> 00:27:58,658
can I get a gram of this concentrate you

771
00:27:56,679 --> 00:28:00,700
hole you'll hand them a card and he'll

772
00:27:58,659 --> 00:28:03,850
hat it'll have your mix on it it'll say

773
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:05,890
like ninety-seven percent THC with two

774
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:07,839
percent tur pennilyn and one percent

775
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:11,528
limonene and then he's gonna give you

776
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:12,759
this perfect homogenized dab and you

777
00:28:11,528 --> 00:28:15,278
just feel like that's exactly what I

778
00:28:12,759 --> 00:28:16,839
needed but still to get there you're

779
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:18,970
gonna have to experiment and figure out

780
00:28:16,839 --> 00:28:20,918
what you like and what works best for

781
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:22,690
you so like I've keep repeating I don't

782
00:28:20,919 --> 00:28:24,700
know the exact prescription or

783
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:27,340
recommendation for you I would start off

784
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:28,899
by smoking flowers of multiple different

785
00:28:27,339 --> 00:28:30,069
strains just take one or two puffs I

786
00:28:28,898 --> 00:28:32,619
don't know how experienced you are in

787
00:28:30,069 --> 00:28:35,648
cannabis but I would definitely start

788
00:28:32,619 --> 00:28:37,538
light smoke a couple puffs of one strain

789
00:28:35,648 --> 00:28:38,889
pick one and stick with it for that that

790
00:28:37,538 --> 00:28:40,629
session you know what I mean go buy a

791
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:41,919
bag of jellybeans buy a bag of lemon

792
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:44,740
Geoffrey buy a bag of LA Confidential

793
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:47,080
buy a bag of cataract cush smoke them at

794
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:49,390
separate times so you can tell exactly

795
00:28:47,079 --> 00:28:51,398
what each one is doing do your normal

796
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:52,899
day if you go to work and then come home

797
00:28:51,398 --> 00:28:55,028
and take off your shoes and take a poop

798
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:57,369
and take a shower and pet the dog after

799
00:28:55,028 --> 00:28:58,509
that routine happens smoke your ball

800
00:28:57,369 --> 00:29:00,369
then do the next thing

801
00:28:58,509 --> 00:29:02,619
routine tomorrow do the same exact thing

802
00:29:00,369 --> 00:29:04,750
smoke your bowl compare the two effects

803
00:29:02,619 --> 00:29:06,099
see if the jellybeans made you giggly or

804
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:08,319
paranoid and see if the LA Confidential

805
00:29:06,099 --> 00:29:09,028
made you lazy or paranoid see what

806
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:11,500
happens

807
00:29:09,028 --> 00:29:14,528
write it down if you're able if you've

808
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:16,028
got a partner ah that you can trust

809
00:29:14,528 --> 00:29:17,079
they will take notes for you a lot of

810
00:29:16,028 --> 00:29:18,700
times I think it's cool cuz your

811
00:29:17,079 --> 00:29:20,408
girlfriend or a lot of times your

812
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:22,149
companion will want to be involved and

813
00:29:20,409 --> 00:29:22,400
they like taking notes and things so

814
00:29:22,148 --> 00:29:23,659
that

815
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:25,640
they can that's a way you could bring

816
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:27,080
them in on this is have them kind of

817
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:28,880
observe and take notes about your

818
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:31,189
progress and see if they feel like you

819
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:33,620
were nicer or better to be around or

820
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:35,180
maybe they had to talk you down and help

821
00:29:33,619 --> 00:29:36,199
you out or something but it may be fun

822
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,890
to have somebody around to take some

823
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:39,080
notes for you

824
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:41,000
alright senior Smith I feel like I've

825
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:42,259
rambled a lot about your email but I

826
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,420
don't feel like I've answered your

827
00:29:42,259 --> 00:29:46,640
question directly I apologize that this

828
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:48,710
is not something I can just answer

829
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:50,300
really directly this is gonna be based

830
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:52,970
on your brain chemistry your body

831
00:29:50,299 --> 00:29:55,609
chemistry which flowers you choose it's

832
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:57,950
gonna take some dialing in so if you

833
00:29:55,609 --> 00:29:59,899
want to message me try the strains that

834
00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:01,269
I recommended and if those don't work

835
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:03,530
for you or if they're not available

836
00:30:01,269 --> 00:30:05,150
message me what is available in your

837
00:30:03,529 --> 00:30:07,490
area and I will talk to you personally

838
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:09,440
and we'll see what we can dial in to get

839
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:11,029
rid of the anxiety because anxiety is a

840
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,890
[ __ ] and nobody should ever have to

841
00:30:11,029 --> 00:30:14,059
live like that

00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:16,670
