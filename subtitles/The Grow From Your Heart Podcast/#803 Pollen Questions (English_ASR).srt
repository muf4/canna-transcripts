listeners new followers here on the

84
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:03,420
podcast in 2015 I suffered a major

85
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:04,919
traumatic brain injury it messed me up

86
00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:07,139
so bad I didn't know my name I couldn't

87
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:08,518
do math I missed a bunch of appointments

88
00:03:07,139 --> 00:03:09,779
and people were calling me saying hey

89
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:10,860
bro where are you and I was saying I

90
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:13,199
don't even know who you are why are you

91
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:15,000
calling me I really messed me up that

92
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:17,878
was in 2015 there were a few months

93
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,620
there where I was not myself it was a

94
00:03:17,878 --> 00:03:22,079
long year of recovery there are still

95
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:23,700
weird uh glitches ticks and problems

96
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,440
that arise from that brain injury

97
00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:26,818
occasionally but I've mostly recovered

98
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:29,039
from that I'm sure it messed up my

99
00:03:26,818 --> 00:03:30,419
personality my memory

100
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:32,039
um right after my brain injury I didn't

101
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:34,139
give a [ __ ] anymore there were things I

102
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:35,158
should care about but I just stopped

103
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:37,500
giving a [ __ ] about a lot of things

104
00:03:35,158 --> 00:03:39,000
after my brain injury so anyway just to

105
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,639
bring some old listeners up or some new

106
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,560
listeners up to speed in 2015 I did

107
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:45,179
experience a major traumatic brain

108
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,979
injury that uh it caused me some big

109
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:49,500
problems I had visual problems memory

110
00:03:46,979 --> 00:03:51,000
problems I was hallucinating a lot I was

111
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,158
saying weird [ __ ] and eventually the

112
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,539
swelling in my brain uh healed up and I

113
00:03:53,158 --> 00:03:56,400
am much better now but sometimes you

114
00:03:54,539 --> 00:03:57,780
guys that's why I'm [ __ ] weird that's

115
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,158
part of why I'm [ __ ] weird I was

116
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,959
already a little bit goofy before the

117
00:03:59,158 --> 00:04:02,939
brain injury the brain injury just kind

118
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,519
of Amplified that weirdness let me stay

119
00:04:02,939 --> 00:04:07,199
focused also the lack of focus is from

120
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,719
the brain injury let me keep going it

121
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:11,639
says we both love cannabis cannabis at a

122
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:14,818
maximum level yes that is absolutely

123
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:16,798
true I am completely in love and uh

124
00:04:14,818 --> 00:04:18,959
infatuated and passionate about this

125
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:21,179
ganja plant that we all love here I love

126
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,759
that it's got so many great uses

127
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:25,620
uh I smoke it for

128
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,240
um medical and recreational purposes

129
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:29,100
somewhere in the middle I say I always

130
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,139
say my first dab that's a medical dab

131
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:33,060
that's second dab that's that's kind of

132
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:35,040
a supplementary dab that third dab that

133
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:36,780
one's all recreational the first two

134
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,220
cure all the problems the third one is

135
00:04:36,779 --> 00:04:40,198
just to have a good time so I'm a

136
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:43,680
recreational and a medical cannabis

137
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:45,120
consumer I not only love the relief and

138
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,978
um the fun that it gives me but I love

139
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,139
seeing other people smoke cannabis and

140
00:04:46,978 --> 00:04:50,879
feel better I was part of the first

141
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:53,160
dispensary in my neighborhood the first

142
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:55,259
dispensary in my city and I got to see

143
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:57,419
uh all walks of life come through that

144
00:04:55,259 --> 00:04:59,460
shop young dudes old ladies and

145
00:04:57,418 --> 00:05:00,719
everything in between and I would see

146
00:04:59,459 --> 00:05:02,879
people come in and they would say hey

147
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,380
I'm suffering from this condition and I

148
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:06,360
would develop a relationship with them

149
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:08,459
and recommend cannabis products if it

150
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,840
was smokables Edibles whatever topicals

151
00:05:08,459 --> 00:05:11,879
we'd get them going

152
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:13,439
in a few weeks when we figured out the

153
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:14,939
right products for them they would come

154
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:16,560
back and I could see an improvement in

155
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:18,300
the quality of their life and that is

156
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,040
amazing that this plant can do that it

157
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:22,439
can improve the quality of Our Lives

158
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:23,699
then we've got the social aspect who

159
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:25,918
doesn't like to hang out and smoke with

160
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:27,900
a bro or a lady or both or whatever

161
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:29,879
smoking with people is one of my

162
00:05:27,899 --> 00:05:32,038
favorite experiences and then I also

163
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:34,500
love the creative aspect of this ganja

164
00:05:32,038 --> 00:05:36,418
plant when I smoke I'm a musician when I

165
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:39,000
smoke I want to go play music music

166
00:05:36,418 --> 00:05:40,680
sounds better food tastes better life is

167
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,079
just a little bit better with this ganja

168
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:45,000
plant and I love how multi-faceted this

169
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:47,639
plant is and how many great positive

170
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,259
benefits we get from the same plan so

171
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:51,000
you are absolutely correct with the idea

172
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:52,620
that we both love cannabis I can tell

173
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,418
that you love cannabis as much as I do

174
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,740
because you've been around for a long

175
00:05:54,418 --> 00:05:57,599
time you've sent a lot of messages and

176
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:59,220
we've interacted a bit and it's been

177
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,020
over a year so that means that you are

178
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:02,639
definitely committed to this ganja plant

179
00:06:01,019 --> 00:06:03,899
now like I said before I do have that

180
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,879
brain injury so I get a little bit

181
00:06:03,899 --> 00:06:08,399
rambly let me get myself back on track

182
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:10,319
there's more to this message it says are

183
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:12,359
you and I the same person on different

184
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,639
planes of existence I don't know man

185
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:17,038
there are some interesting coincidences

186
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,900
anyway that is really funny I do believe

187
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:20,639
in parallel universes and I do believe

188
00:06:18,899 --> 00:06:22,138
in weird things like that so maybe

189
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,699
somewhere along the line bro we've got

190
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:25,560
some of the same timeline programmed

191
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:27,780
into us maybe the Matrix spit us out at

192
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:29,519
the same time whatever human printer you

193
00:06:27,779 --> 00:06:31,918
believe in maybe we came from the same

194
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:33,659
human printing Factory I don't know bro

195
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:34,918
but I love that we're such good friends

196
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,419
and we don't even know each other that's

197
00:06:34,918 --> 00:06:38,698
[ __ ] awesome did we just become best

198
00:06:36,418 --> 00:06:40,799
friends bro there's more to this it says

199
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:42,538
cool if you remember me no big deal if

200
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,939
not bro I remember you how would I not

201
00:06:42,538 --> 00:06:46,620
remember my best friend it says I'm back

202
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:48,959
and growing some fluff head which I

203
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:50,579
acquired from the dude's world big shout

204
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:52,019
out to dudes World check out the dude's

205
00:06:50,579 --> 00:06:54,060
world if you need some irie genetics

206
00:06:52,019 --> 00:06:55,859
beans up there in Canada big up dude I

207
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:58,199
hope you're doing well bro also there's

208
00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:00,600
more it says I'm running three plants

209
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:02,280
and noticing some differences and

210
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,199
similarities that's a good thing to

211
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:06,478
observe then it says I have a question

212
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:08,220
regarding powdery mildew and its

213
00:07:06,478 --> 00:07:10,800
resistance this is where the spark gets

214
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:13,259
fun now it goes on it says is powdery

215
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,120
mildew resistance a phenotypical trait

216
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:16,740
meaning that two plants from the same

217
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,560
population can possibly display

218
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:21,598
different levels of resistance the quick

219
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,220
answer to that is yes that is a

220
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:25,259
phenotypical trait just like one of

221
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:26,460
those plants May smell more like one

222
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:27,538
thing the other one may smell like

223
00:07:26,459 --> 00:07:30,239
another thing

224
00:07:27,538 --> 00:07:32,279
that is absolutely a phenotypical trait

225
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,139
so you could put both of those plants on

226
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:36,239
the same room we could introduce powdery

227
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:38,220
mildew on purpose and you'll see one may

228
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,319
decimate one plant and one may not touch

229
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:42,240
the other plant that is absolutely a

230
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,520
phenotypical trait now he does give an

231
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,199
example he said I've got fluff head uh

232
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:48,839
could my fluff head number one and fluff

233
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:51,180
head number two have the same PM

234
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:52,500
resistance no they're it's very likely

235
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:54,418
very possible that they will be

236
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:56,220
different uh those are bred from two

237
00:07:54,418 --> 00:07:58,379
vastly different parents we've got the

238
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:59,880
Afterglow which grows kind of tall and

239
00:07:58,379 --> 00:08:01,680
skinny and it's got those long thin

240
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:03,360
tropical leaves and then we've got the

241
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,220
chem 4 which grows differently than that

242
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,860
it's shorter squattier bigger leaves

243
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:09,479
totally different flavor profiles and

244
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:10,800
since we've started with two vastly

245
00:08:09,478 --> 00:08:12,779
different ingredients we can expect

246
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,939
vastly different outcomes in some of

247
00:08:12,779 --> 00:08:17,098
those phenotypes some of them may be

248
00:08:14,939 --> 00:08:18,538
completely powdery mildew resistant and

249
00:08:17,098 --> 00:08:20,639
some of them may be susceptible to

250
00:08:18,538 --> 00:08:22,740
powdery mildew resistance I do know that

251
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,900
the Afterglow is generally resistant to

252
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:26,639
the powdery mildew but compared to other

253
00:08:24,899 --> 00:08:28,978
phenotypes you are going to see

254
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:31,439
differences in in that level of

255
00:08:28,978 --> 00:08:32,939
resistance the message says hopefully I

256
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:34,679
worded that well for you I'll be back

257
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:36,599
with more questions especially now that

258
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:38,038
you're giving out seeds for the

259
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:39,959
questions that's right guys I'm not sure

260
00:08:38,038 --> 00:08:41,699
if I mentioned this but if you send me a

261
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:43,619
grow question on the grow help tab at

262
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:45,959
iregenetics.com and I read that question

263
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:47,940
here on the show you in a free pack of

264
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:49,979
irie genetic seeds so my buddy Dave up

265
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:51,839
there in Ontario has won himself a free

266
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:53,580
pack of seeds Dave you worded this

267
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,200
perfectly bro I totally understand the

268
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:57,240
question you're basically one and this

269
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,740
goes for every strain we highlighted

270
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,180
fluff head here in this uh question

271
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:02,759
because that's what my buddy is growing

272
00:09:00,179 --> 00:09:04,679
but this goes with every strain now do

273
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:06,778
keep in mind that many strains are

274
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:08,519
powdery mildew resistant if they're bred

275
00:09:06,778 --> 00:09:10,860
in areas where powdery mildew is common

276
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:12,360
over several Generations those plants

277
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:14,278
will build that powdery mildew

278
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,959
resistance that just naturally will be

279
00:09:14,278 --> 00:09:17,939
in there a lot of plants do have that

280
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:20,039
some plants on the other hand just are

281
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:21,899
naturally susceptible to the powdery

282
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:23,639
mildew now within those two categories

283
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:25,200
we're going to see the plants that

284
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:27,240
really get it and the plants that don't

285
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,220
get it that's just a phenotypical trait

286
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,600
or for an expression all right let me

287
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:32,339
make sure I wrapped all this up thanks

288
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,259
for the great content it has helped me

289
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:36,000
out on my journey bro that is what the

290
00:09:34,259 --> 00:09:37,620
the whole point of this is to get

291
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,360
everybody on a great cannabis Journey

292
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:40,560
growing can be very frustrating there

293
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,360
are a lot of trials and tribulations

294
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:43,619
that come along with cannabis growing

295
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,899
there's a lot of [ __ ] information

296
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:47,820
out there I'm trying to get everybody on

297
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:50,159
a good path and growing the best

298
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:51,839
possible cannabis they can grow and

299
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:53,338
enjoying it while they do it because we

300
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,019
can all grow good weed and struggle at

301
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:57,000
the same time let's try to make it easy

302
00:09:55,019 --> 00:09:59,519
for everybody the last line is my

303
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,100
favorite it says you are my cannabis

304
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:04,139
hero sincerely from Dave bro I didn't

305
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:06,060
know that I was anybody's hero but that

306
00:10:04,139 --> 00:10:08,220
does mean a lot to me much respect big

307
00:10:06,059 --> 00:10:10,018
fist bro bro thank you stay cool up

308
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:12,000
there in Canada and send me more

309
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:13,919
questions Dave also send me your address

310
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,440
I think I may have it already but please

311
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:17,939
do refresh my memory because we talked

312
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,440
about that brain injury bro you know

313
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:21,540
what I'm talking about I'd love to get

314
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,940
you a pack of seeds up there in Canada

315
00:10:21,539 --> 00:10:25,259
land all right we've got a good flow

316
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:26,760
going there's no need to take a break

317
00:10:25,259 --> 00:10:29,159
now let's keep going I've got another

318
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:31,200
question here in in front of me this one

319
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:32,879
also came from the grow help tab on the

320
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,160
ire genetics website this one came from

321
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:37,679
our buddy phillibong I like that name a

322
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:39,600
lot what up philabong you fillabong I'll

323
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:42,179
rip a bong all right the question goes

324
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,860
first of all I love your podcast thank

325
00:10:42,179 --> 00:10:45,719
you bro that is a great compliment and a

326
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:47,399
good way to start a message that says

327
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:49,139
they are extremely helpful and you are a

328
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:51,659
great person for sharing your knowledge

329
00:10:49,139 --> 00:10:53,278
I appreciate that

330
00:10:51,659 --> 00:10:54,659
um I know that it's kindness and all

331
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:56,519
that stuff that does it but also there's

332
00:10:54,659 --> 00:10:57,958
some weird thing inside of me that I

333
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:59,700
feel like I would explode if I didn't

334
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:02,578
share my knowledge and kind of help you

335
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:05,339
guys in this way I was given the gift of

336
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:07,199
being able to uh receive information and

337
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:09,060
also filter out the [ __ ] that's one

338
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,040
of my big gifts I can receive

339
00:11:09,059 --> 00:11:12,599
information I can read I can research

340
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:14,879
and I can hear a bunch of things and

341
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,620
then I can put that into a small package

342
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:18,120
and redeliver it in a way that everybody

343
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:19,560
can understand it that way you guys

344
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,120
don't have to stay up till six in the

345
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:22,799
morning reading the internet I already

346
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,240
did that for you and I'll come put that

347
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:25,859
out for you I feel like I'm I'm

348
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,539
compelled by I don't know what you

349
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:28,980
believe in they call me Rasta Jeff I

350
00:11:27,539 --> 00:11:30,419
wear red gold and green colors all the

351
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:32,220
time you know what I believe in that's

352
00:11:30,419 --> 00:11:34,559
not important whatever you believe in

353
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:36,540
that compels me to share this message

354
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:38,099
with you that just and if I didn't share

355
00:11:36,539 --> 00:11:40,379
that message it would be disrespectful

356
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:42,420
to whatever gave me this gift and this

357
00:11:40,379 --> 00:11:44,278
energy so thank you for noticing uh

358
00:11:42,419 --> 00:11:46,078
thank you for mentioning uh that I share

359
00:11:44,278 --> 00:11:47,519
this knowledge so it does go on there's

360
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:48,958
actually content to the message that

361
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,539
says I've been growing for a couple of

362
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:54,059
years and a 4X4 tent and I've been been

363
00:11:51,539 --> 00:11:56,159
searching for some prime females and I

364
00:11:54,059 --> 00:11:58,199
now have a few so far including lemon

365
00:11:56,159 --> 00:12:00,360
Jeffrey and an orange gasm that is very

366
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,800
promising at this point all right so

367
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,600
we're grown in a 4x4 you've been

368
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:05,458
searching for some stuff and you've got

369
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,899
a lemon Jeff and an orange gasm I'm glad

370
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:08,399
I'm glad you found those those are great

371
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:10,679
lines they're going to do very well for

372
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,778
you it also says I've always wanted to

373
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:15,179
create my own strains since I started

374
00:12:12,778 --> 00:12:17,879
smoking 28 years ago bro we're on the

375
00:12:15,179 --> 00:12:19,500
same team we're OG veteran smokers and

376
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:20,820
also I understand that feeling of

377
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,440
wanting to create strains something

378
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:23,879
about it you just know you're like I

379
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,440
could breed something and then it's in

380
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:27,899
you so you're ready to do it bro let's

381
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,060
get it on anyway it says I found a male

382
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:32,159
that I've been keeping for a while and I

383
00:12:30,059 --> 00:12:34,018
really like and I'm going to do a pollen

384
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:35,819
run in the next month after I finish up

385
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:37,980
this flower run sounds like a good

386
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:39,959
strategy this male has a structure I

387
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:42,000
want and the smell is exactly what I

388
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:43,919
want I want to collect as much pollen as

389
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,379
I can and hold on to it that's a good

390
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:48,240
strategy I don't collect pollen most of

391
00:12:46,379 --> 00:12:50,519
the time I honestly just do live plant

392
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,680
pollination plant porn if you will but

393
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:54,539
your collection an idea will work it

394
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:56,399
says at what point in flower should I

395
00:12:54,539 --> 00:12:58,500
pollinate the female's four best results

396
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,600
I know it won't be the same time for

397
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:02,639
every pheno and plant but a general idea

398
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,500
is all I need and I can play with it

399
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:07,860
from there thank you for all you do from

400
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:09,480
the community peace from Phila bong big

401
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:11,159
shout out to my buddy philabong this is

402
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,720
a great question I don't remember if

403
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:15,059
I've said this or not but phillabong

404

00:13:25,259 --> 00:13:29,458
restocks and drops but now let's answer

411
00:13:27,419 --> 00:13:31,379
this question about pollination timing

412
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:32,699
this is a really good question so the

413
00:13:31,379 --> 00:13:34,200
parts on the plant though we like to

414
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,579
call hairs a lot of Growers call them

415
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,920
hairs those are pistols the little

416
00:13:35,578 --> 00:13:39,958
dandelion parts that is the part of your

417
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:41,519
plant which will receive the pollen the

418
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:42,659
pollen will hit that little uh that

419
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,459
little hair that's sticking up the

420
00:13:42,659 --> 00:13:45,899
pollen will travel down that hair and

421
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:47,819
inside once it gets down to the bottom

422
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:49,440
there it'll hit the ovule inside of the

423
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:51,660
bract and that is where the seed will

424
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,519
begin to form now you are right with the

425
00:13:51,659 --> 00:13:55,019
idea that not every plant and phenotype

426
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:57,179
is going to be ready for pollen at the

427
00:13:55,019 --> 00:14:00,839
same time but it is generally between

428
00:13:57,179 --> 00:14:03,359
days 18 to 23 ish all the way up to

429
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:06,120
about day 32-ish depending on the plant

430
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,860
I often talk about my strawberry fields

431
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:10,440
and my Platinum Tangy plants because

432
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:12,778
they want pollen at very different times

433
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:15,480
the Platinum Tangy plant that I breed

434
00:14:12,778 --> 00:14:18,659
with is ready for pollen approximately 7

435
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:20,399
to 10 days before that Strawberry Fields

436
00:14:18,659 --> 00:14:21,958
plant so it's ideal for me to stagger

437
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,879
those two plants when I put them in the

438
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:26,039
room so I can get them at their Peak

439
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:27,778
pollination times at the same time they

440
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:29,458
don't go in the same time so I'll put

441
00:14:27,778 --> 00:14:30,838
that Strawberry Fields plant in there on

442
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:33,000
one day and then I'll wait about a week

443
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:34,920
or 10 days then I'll drag that Platinum

444
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,539
Tangy plant in there now they're both in

445
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:38,939
flour and they will both be ready for

446
00:14:36,539 --> 00:14:40,559
pollen at the exact same time now what

447
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:42,480
you're looking for my friend as a new

448
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:44,698
breeder those pistols will receive

449
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,259
pollen as soon as they begin to form but

450
00:14:44,698 --> 00:14:47,879
what I recommend is watching that plant

451
00:14:46,259 --> 00:14:49,139
and learning that plant you should be

452
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:50,458
breeding with the plant you have grown

453
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:52,379
several times you've got a few Great

454
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:54,239
Cuts in this this room you should be

455
00:14:52,379 --> 00:14:56,458
watching these plants get an idea when

456
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,320
do those pistols look the biggest the

457
00:14:56,458 --> 00:15:00,299
fluffiest the most available when are

458
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,040
there the most of them you can tell by

459
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:03,599
looking the pistols are going to start

460
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:04,799
off by popping out of the buds and

461
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,659
they're going to get longer then they're

462
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:08,879
going to get thicker when they are at

463
00:15:06,659 --> 00:15:10,620
their longest and thickest point that is

464
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:12,778
Peak pollination time those are the

465
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:14,519
plants pollen receiving parts that was a

466
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:16,379
lot of peas in one sentence there but

467
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:18,000
those that is Peak pollination time when

468
00:15:16,379 --> 00:15:20,338
those pistols are nice and ripe you'll

469
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,679
have to look at the plant there is no

470
00:15:20,339 --> 00:15:24,600
perfect day for pollination you've got a

471
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:26,278
nice window there's a nice time frame of

472
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,139
when these plants will receive pollen

473
00:15:26,278 --> 00:15:30,659
they'll receive pollen probably all the

474
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:33,839
way up from about day 17 all the way up

475
00:15:30,659 --> 00:15:35,458
into like day 35 or 40 maybe even later

476
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,260
that are able to receive pollen if there

477
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:39,119
are pistols available they can probably

478
00:15:37,259 --> 00:15:40,860
receive pollen eventually those pistols

479
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,778
dry up and weather up and they can no

480
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:44,699
longer take it but as long as you've got

481
00:15:42,778 --> 00:15:46,740
pistols on there you can pollinate them

482
00:15:44,698 --> 00:15:48,419
what you've got to do is the breeder is

483
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:50,339
pay attention to those female plants and

484
00:15:48,419 --> 00:15:53,039
see when you've got the maximum amount

485
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:54,660
of pistol healthy viable pistols

486
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:56,759
available another thing I'm going to

487
00:15:54,659 --> 00:15:58,919
recommend is don't touch those pistols

488
00:15:56,759 --> 00:16:00,539
if you plan on pollinating a plant don't

489
00:15:58,919 --> 00:16:02,519
touch those pistols if it's with your

490
00:16:00,539 --> 00:16:04,259
hands with your shirt with anything try

491
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:06,659
not to touch them we want them healthy

492
00:16:04,259 --> 00:16:08,159
and viable and active also I don't like

493
00:16:06,659 --> 00:16:10,139
to spray plants that I'm going to

494
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:11,879
pollinate I feel like those sprays can

495
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:13,919
disrupt those pistols and I want as many

496
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:15,778
as I can have now I know you would like

497
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:17,278
a closer number a more accurate a more

498
00:16:15,778 --> 00:16:19,320
precise number of when to pollinate

499
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:22,740
these plants I'm going to say sometime

500
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:24,240
between day 25 and day 32 is usually the

501
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:26,278
best time you've got about a week window

502
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,959
there that is usually Peak pollination

503
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:29,820
time here's what happens if you

504
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:31,078
pollinate too early you don't get as

505
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:32,639
many seeds as you could have you could

506
00:16:31,078 --> 00:16:34,500
have gotten more seeds here's what

507
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:35,820
happens if you pollinate too late you

508
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,620
don't get as many seeds as you could

509
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:39,360
have if you pollinate right at the right

510
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:41,879
time you get the maximum amount of

511
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,440
perfect beautiful ripe seeds if you

512
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:44,519
pollinate too early you're just not

513
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,199
going to get as many if you're making

514
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:48,000
these seeds for yourself that will not

515
00:16:46,198 --> 00:16:49,679
be a problem if you pollinate too late

516
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,299
it will not be a problem if you're

517
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:53,278
making seeds for yourself if you if it's

518
00:16:51,299 --> 00:16:54,240
your first run you can put the plant in

519
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:55,980
there and whenever it's got enough

520
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,959
pistols you can pollinate it or you can

521
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:59,278
put two plants in at the same time and

522
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:01,138
they will pollinate on the right time

523
00:16:59,278 --> 00:17:03,179
and you will make plenty of seeds to

524
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:04,380
play with it's that second third and

525
00:17:03,179 --> 00:17:06,359
fourth run is when you're going to want

526
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:07,919
to learn how to dial things in and time

527
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:10,500
it more perfectly so that you can get

528
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:12,360
the maximum amount of seeds I breed for

529
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:14,578
production people are buying my seeds I

530
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:16,198
need the maximum amount of seeds that's

531
00:17:14,578 --> 00:17:17,938
why I drag plants in at different times

532
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:20,220
and I really get the timing nailed down

533
00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:22,079
if you can't do that that's fine put a

534
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:23,640
plant in a room put another plant in a

535
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:24,899
room put some pollen on those [ __ ]

536
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:27,059
and make some seeds it's not as

537
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:28,919
technical or hyper critical as we would

538
00:17:27,058 --> 00:17:30,839
like it to be this happens in nature

539
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:32,820
outdoors with no control nature just

540
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:34,798
does it and it [ __ ] works every year

541
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:37,259
on its own so don't stress too much

542
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:39,179
don't be too hyper critical about the

543
00:17:37,259 --> 00:17:41,099
timing fall in love with the process of

544
00:17:39,179 --> 00:17:42,660
breeding watch when those pistols are

545
00:17:41,099 --> 00:17:44,939
ripe watch when that male plant starts

546
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:46,440
dumping his pollen make documents make

547
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:48,058
notes of both of those things these

548
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:51,419
plants look really ready for pollen

549
00:17:48,058 --> 00:17:52,918
about day 23 about day 27 and they kind

550
00:17:51,419 --> 00:17:55,620
of started looking withered up I should

551
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:57,360
probably pollinate around day 24. make a

552
00:17:55,619 --> 00:17:59,219
note of when your male plant really make

553
00:17:57,359 --> 00:18:01,319
a note of when he starts dropping pollen

554
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:04,140
day 14 he started putting out pollen day

555
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:05,879
23 he was dumping by day 32 I couldn't

556
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:08,400
walk by him without pollen flying

557
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:11,160
everywhere then at day 45 he quit making

558
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,840
pollen document that [ __ ] then do the

559
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:14,759
math equation in the future and you know

560
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:16,500
I need pollen at this time I need

561
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:18,240
[ __ ] female plants will be ready at

562
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,440
this time do the math and get them in

563
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,480
the room at the same time and get them

564
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,519
going but honestly like I said a moment

565
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:25,558
ago it's not hyper critical if you've

566
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:27,720
got pistols and you've got pollen you

567
00:18:25,558 --> 00:18:29,639
will get seeds my dude all right my

568
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,839
friend Phila bong I hope I've answered

569
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,940
your question this was a great question

570
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:34,619
here once again please do send me your

571
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:37,200
shipping info so that I can get you a

572
00:18:34,619 --> 00:18:38,219
free pack of irie genetic seeds and I

573
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,440
know I've said this on a couple of

574
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:42,720
episodes but it keeps happening if you

575
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:44,880
have won free seeds and you would like

576
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,620
me to send them to you please include a

577

00:18:46,619 --> 00:18:51,359
real name but like a logical rational

579
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:53,039
name for me to put on the package I

580
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:54,659

name but if you want the USPS to go

583

00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,500
pack of seeds all right I've got another

589
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,538
great question here in front of me this

590
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:15,298
one also did come from the grow help tab

591
00:19:12,538 --> 00:19:17,640
on iregenetics.com which means my friend

592
00:19:15,298 --> 00:19:19,200
Scott has won a free pack of seeds Scott

593
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:21,179
you know the drill my dude please send

594
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,160
me your real name and your address so

595
00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:25,200
that I can send you a free pack of irie

596
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:27,240
genetic seeds this one again came from

597
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:30,840
our buddy Scott he has a general grow

598
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:33,720
question and it says I run a six two

599
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:35,939
light schedule during veg and 12 12

600
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:38,519
during flower okay so he's got the

601
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:41,340
lights on for six hours on and two hours

602
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:43,139
off it sounds like during veg which

603
00:19:41,339 --> 00:19:44,819
sounds one monkey but I understand why

604
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:46,380
that works I already know people are

605
00:19:44,819 --> 00:19:48,359
going to be triggered by that six hours

606
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:49,799
on and two hour off light schedule

607
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:51,659
during veg they're going to say why

608
00:19:49,798 --> 00:19:53,819
don't the plants go into flower because

609
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:55,679
that two hour dark frame is just enough

610
00:19:53,819 --> 00:19:57,178
to let the plants go to sleep and then

611
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:58,980
he wakes them up right before they're

612
00:19:57,179 --> 00:20:00,298
actually in the sleep mode or it would

613
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:02,579
trigger them to go to flower I

614
00:20:00,298 --> 00:20:04,918
understand that then 12 12 like normal

615
00:20:02,579 --> 00:20:08,418
and flower the question here is could I

616
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:12,538
do something like 6 2 6 12 during flower

617
00:20:08,419 --> 00:20:14,038
six on two off six on 12 off

618
00:20:12,538 --> 00:20:16,079
um I understand the question my main

619
00:20:14,038 --> 00:20:18,779
answer I wrote this on the paper it says

620
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:20,879
why why would you try to do that why do

621
00:20:18,779 --> 00:20:23,579
you want to do that that two hour off

622
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:25,320
period is basically making your plants

623
00:20:23,579 --> 00:20:27,720
hungry for life that is two hours that

624
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:29,879
they could have gotten photons uh Photon

625
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:31,980
energy in the plant in the room and they

626
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:36,059
could have done that much more work so

627
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:37,679
over 60 days that's 120 hours of photons

628
00:20:36,058 --> 00:20:38,879
which you are neglecting to give these

629
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:42,780
plants which they could have gotten

630
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:44,400
think about it this way if you are a a

631
00:20:42,779 --> 00:20:46,019
um a gym rat let's just say you're going

632
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,538
to the gym and you're trying to work out

633
00:20:46,019 --> 00:20:50,759
I'm working out two more hours a day

634
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:53,400
than you every single day so at the end

635
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:55,019
of this 60 day cycle I've got 120 more

636
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:57,298
reps or whatever you want to call them

637
00:20:55,019 --> 00:20:58,679
under my belt my plants are going to be

638
00:20:57,298 --> 00:21:00,298
stronger my plants are going to be

639
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:02,400
bigger better more robust because

640
00:21:00,298 --> 00:21:05,099
they've gotten more light that is my

641
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:07,919
opinion and my experience

642
00:21:05,099 --> 00:21:11,879
um so if you're doing six two in veg and

643
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:14,640
they're not going into flour six two

644
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:15,960
six is definitely not going to work for

645
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,059
a flower cycle you're doing that

646
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:19,620
basically and it's I don't I don't think

647
00:21:18,058 --> 00:21:22,619
that that would work for a flowering

648
00:21:19,619 --> 00:21:24,178
cycle and I don't I don't get why you

649
00:21:22,619 --> 00:21:26,219
want to do that so I guess I've got a

650
00:21:24,179 --> 00:21:28,559
follow-up question my dude if you really

651
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:30,480
want to do this please explain to me why

652
00:21:28,558 --> 00:21:32,279
why do you need to do this what is the

653
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,798
method to your Madness but my quick

654
00:21:32,279 --> 00:21:35,940
answer is why why are we Reinventing the

655
00:21:34,798 --> 00:21:38,400
wheel in this way and I do understand

656
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:41,460
that I've introduced the 186 light cycle

657
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:44,100
at the end of flower but I can give you

658
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:45,779
a very rational and well spoken and well

659
00:21:44,099 --> 00:21:48,119
thought out reason as to why I'm doing

660
00:21:45,779 --> 00:21:50,399
that I don't see a rhyme or a reason for

661
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:52,019
this new technique unless maybe the room

662
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,940
is getting too hot you need to save some

663
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:56,220
electricity but there are other ways to

664
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:58,919
work on that strategy my first answer my

665
00:21:56,220 --> 00:22:00,298
dude is why and then I want some

666
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:01,799
follow-ups I want to know why you're

667
00:22:00,298 --> 00:22:03,960
going to do this why that's straight up

668
00:22:01,798 --> 00:22:05,400

669

672
00:22:10,019 --> 00:22:13,319
shipping address alright I've got one

673
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:14,460
more more a question here in front of me

674
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:16,079
we're going to bang this one out right

675
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:18,360
here at the end of the episode this is a

676
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:20,339
quick one also came from the irie

677
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:23,219
director irie genetics website the grow

678
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:25,980
help tab this one came from Monsoon City

679
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:27,900
big up to my dude Monsoon City it says

680
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:30,298
quick question I got some rhombus

681
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:33,120
freebies a while back are those Femmes

682
00:22:30,298 --> 00:22:35,099
because I only see fem rhombus on the

683
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:37,139
website yes that is correct the rhombus

684
00:22:35,099 --> 00:22:38,939
is a feminized line I have not made that

685
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:40,679
in regs I don't think I will make reg

686
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:42,960
seeds of the rhombus

687
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:45,120
it's possible but I don't have any plans

688
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,640
for that at this current time so those

689
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:49,558
are feminized seeds the website is quite

690
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:50,940
accurate at this time I think if there's

691
00:22:49,558 --> 00:22:52,319
something missing on the website that

692
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:54,058
you'd like to see if there's a detail

693
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:56,099
please let me know I'm working on

694
00:22:54,058 --> 00:22:58,139
updating the website it's mostly me that

695
00:22:56,099 --> 00:22:59,819
does I've got a web guy that does this

696
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:01,500
stuff but I've got to create the content

697
00:22:59,819 --> 00:23:02,939
and then I'll send it to him but if

698
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,380
something's wonky or wrong please let me

699
