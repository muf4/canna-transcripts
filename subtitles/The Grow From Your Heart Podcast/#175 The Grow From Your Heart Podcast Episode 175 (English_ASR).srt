of a Facebook group I don't know if Sam

88
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:42,590
is likely Sam or Sammy was something

89
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:44,000
close to Sam so uh we were I was in a

90
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:45,259
Facebook group I'm no longer a member of

91
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,530
that group but I don't have any issues

92
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:49,789
with that I was trying so I don't want

93
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:53,359
to sound like an [ __ ] but people post

94
00:03:49,789 --> 00:03:54,650
the dumbest [ __ ] like I've got spider

95
00:03:53,359 --> 00:03:56,269
mites what do I do and I'm like you

96
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:57,709
should be in your plants yeah and then

97
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:59,090
put baking soda and vinegar on

98
00:03:57,709 --> 00:04:02,299
everything and I'm like why is that

99
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:04,579
happening people I don't know no one

100
00:04:02,299 --> 00:04:06,829
wants to or do anything for themselves

101
00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:08,269
the beginning but that's why I get mad

102
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:09,799
that's why I'm like why are you asking

103
00:04:08,269 --> 00:04:11,840
if what you can do with this when you

104
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:13,459
know you can go google this it's this is

105
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,608
101 if you got a one on one thing go

106
00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:18,620
google it it's probably any book that

107
00:04:16,608 --> 00:04:20,060
says cannabis growing on the front of it

108
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:21,649
if you just bought a cannabis growing

109
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:23,449
book you could go to the glossary or

110
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:25,699
they index look for your problem find it

111
00:04:23,449 --> 00:04:27,348
turn to that page you'd find try it in

112
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:27,860
truth solutions instead you want to go

113
00:04:27,348 --> 00:04:29,180
to face

114
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:30,770
and ask some dude with the clever

115
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:33,139
[ __ ] name who doesn't even have

116
00:04:30,769 --> 00:04:34,818
pictures of aggro questions and he's

117
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:36,860
like telling you to do the weirdest [ __ ]

118
00:04:34,819 --> 00:04:38,419
and so I'll go in there and I'll be like

119
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:41,120
no you shouldn't do that and I will give

120
00:04:38,418 --> 00:04:43,639
a factual reason why and then I will

121
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,709
state a positive way to improve your

122
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:47,810
solution so that that way or improve

123
00:04:45,709 --> 00:04:49,370
your situation so that way you're not is

124
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:51,079
a lot of the things they say will cause

125
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:52,519
you even more problems as you've started

126
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:54,438
with so I'm like don't do that do this

127
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:55,549
and people hate on me like you're an

128
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:56,990
[ __ ] just cuz you're an expert

129
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:58,699
doesn't mean we can all do that I'm like

130
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:00,710
you can yeah and I think they're afraid

131
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:01,968
of a little bit of work and spinning a

132
00:05:00,709 --> 00:05:03,378
couple of bucks they want to make as

133
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:04,848
much as they can off of this crop

134
00:05:03,379 --> 00:05:08,930
without putting any energy and money

135
00:05:04,848 --> 00:05:13,000
into it that's why I jumped in it

136
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:13,000
because I'll see them going at you

137
00:05:13,658 --> 00:05:18,408
calling you an [ __ ] yeah I can't

138
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:21,528
handle that because just when the best

139
00:05:18,408 --> 00:05:23,089
dudes I know like I mean you know

140
00:05:21,528 --> 00:05:25,339
whatever we've been friends or whatever

141
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:25,728
but when I see that happening I won't

142
00:05:25,339 --> 00:05:27,258
allow it

143
00:05:25,728 --> 00:05:28,609
I'll come in and I'll interject and get

144
00:05:27,259 --> 00:05:30,259
your back and then they'll try to

145
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:31,550
challenge my knowledge and I might come

146
00:05:30,259 --> 00:05:33,319
on I'm not I don't know everything but

147
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:41,150
you're you're messing with the big dog

148
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:43,430
here so they booted me real quick and

149
00:05:41,149 --> 00:05:44,658
then you kept screenshot of me what they

150
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:46,310
were saying which was gradually they're

151
00:05:44,658 --> 00:05:47,810
trying to say this bro but yeah I

152
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:49,639

154
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:51,978
something about you don't even realize

155
00:05:50,838 --> 00:05:53,360
the wealth of knowledge you just

156
00:05:51,978 --> 00:05:54,500
eliminate you from this group and I

157
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,060
appreciate that that's great

158
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:58,668
and it's true a lot of those people they

159
00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:00,168
have no idea what's even happening when

160
00:05:58,668 --> 00:06:01,698

over your head and I feel like a lot of

165
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:11,569
the problem is ego I bruised some egos

166
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:12,978
and then and I don't know it all also

167
00:06:11,569 --> 00:06:15,050
and you know how I did learn I'll admit

168
00:06:12,978 --> 00:06:20,060
a lot of the way I'll learn two things

169
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:21,620
was by [ __ ] things up yeah I've been

170
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:23,120
growing for a long time so I made a lot

171
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:24,348
of mistakes and I'm willing to admit

172
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,360
that and I'm willing to share my

173
00:06:24,348 --> 00:06:28,579
mistakes with people and they don't even

174
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:30,020
realize that I'm saying I did what

175

you're trying to do and it doesn't work

176
00:06:30,019 --> 00:06:33,709

177
00:06:32,389 --> 00:06:35,509

178

did I'm gonna tell you how to get past

179

192
00:06:59,779 --> 00:07:11,599
cuz I put my dry face on there was

193
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:13,579
another person here she took a DAB and

194
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:15,289
she is now tucked in in bed probably

195
00:07:13,579 --> 00:07:18,250
snoring like a champion I was looking

196
00:07:15,288 --> 00:07:20,360
forward to trying that I never have but

197
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:26,810
once you saw what he did to her you kind

198
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:28,038
of changed your whole mind so she's

199
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:29,990
gonna listen to this show later and be

200
00:07:28,038 --> 00:07:32,300
like okay thanks but I'm kind of glad

201
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:34,788
that those people are failures on the

202
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:37,250
forums and on Facebook groups because

203
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:39,800
it's those groups kind of contributed to

204
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:41,209
me starting this podcast I was hanging

205
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,650
out at Maddie's house late at night and

206
00:07:41,209 --> 00:07:45,948
answering Gro questions and that's what

207
00:07:42,649 --> 00:07:47,598
contributed to it and there's another

208
00:07:45,949 --> 00:07:50,060
podcast I would listen to and people

209
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:51,469
would ask questions and instead they'd

210
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:53,629
be like I have spider mites what do I do

211
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:55,630
and instead of saying fix the room find

212
00:07:53,629 --> 00:07:57,800
the my it's cleanup and then maybe use a

213
00:07:55,629 --> 00:07:59,120
type of product they would say oh go to

214
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,009
the store and buy this you could get

215
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,060
this store made by this company it's

216
00:08:01,009 --> 00:08:03,500
only this much you can get it this

217
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:08,329
website for this much tell them that

218
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:09,709
sales this code which is my name you're

219
00:08:08,329 --> 00:08:11,418
making a lot of damn money this isn't

220
00:08:09,709 --> 00:08:13,969
even a real email from a real listener

221
00:08:11,418 --> 00:08:16,158
to me and I could feel that from a very

222
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:18,310
specific show and I was like that's

223
00:08:16,158 --> 00:08:21,079
dirty I don't want to do that to people

224
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:24,379
that podcast kind of inspired me to do a

225
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:26,389
show and then uh Tim Tim Martin had a

226
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:27,978
podcast for a little while there the JDR

227
00:08:26,389 --> 00:08:30,519
the John Doe radio that inspired this

228
00:08:27,978 --> 00:08:32,509
and then coral coral reef er of course I

229
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:34,250
wanted to fill the gap that she was

230
00:08:32,509 --> 00:08:37,399
missing she did all the new stuff yeah

231
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:40,458
do the gross stuff and then uh Adam Hill

232
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:42,168
had a fun podcast and his what so kind

233
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:43,369
of join that vibe so that's kind of so

234
00:08:42,168 --> 00:08:44,600
all that stupid stuff is what I'm

235
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:46,070
getting at is actually the Facebook

236
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,480
group sucking and all that stuff I

237
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:48,950
wanted to help people out so that's part

238
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:51,440
of why I started the podcast without all

239
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:53,028
those crappy info avenues the show

240
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,230
probably would not have happened so

241
00:08:53,028 --> 00:08:55,970
maybe it's a good thing that the

242
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:57,680
things out there I guess some bad things

243
00:08:55,970 --> 00:09:00,050
always come a good thing yes yeah right

244
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:01,459
inspiration that's I mean why not lead

245
00:09:00,049 --> 00:09:02,899
people the right way you know in a fun

246
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:04,730
way instead of making it boring someone

247
00:09:02,899 --> 00:09:06,199
wants to pay attention and it's so much

248
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:07,789
easier to listen than to read everything

249
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,230
you can absorb this show while you're

250
00:09:07,789 --> 00:09:10,399
driving down the highway you can be on

251
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:12,800
your way to work you could be in your

252
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,750
cubicle with an earbud in whatever you

253
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:16,069
do yeah listen to a podcast to learn how

254
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,299
to grow a weed and meet Sammy The

255
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:18,350

scrolling through his Instagram right

257
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:24,440
now and checking him out some reason

258
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:26,330
that feels weird when I say that so uh

259
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,140
let's talk about your growing history

260
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:28,700
and stuff well let's give you some

261
00:09:27,139 --> 00:09:30,080
credibility here on the podcast I know

your coolest [ __ ] but nobody else here

263
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:38,480
has met you before you know since I

264
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:40,370
first tried marijuana I always wanted to

265
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,899
grow it and once I was old enough to do

266
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:44,299
my own thing I started just dabbling

267
00:09:41,899 --> 00:09:46,250
with it playing with it and uh reading I

268
00:09:44,299 --> 00:09:48,049
read for about 10 years before I ever

269
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:49,879
put a seed in the ground okay you know

270
00:09:48,049 --> 00:09:51,679
its power and yeah but something I

271
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:54,289
encourage reading first and then it just

272
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:55,819

00:11:30,909 --> 00:11:34,838
bounce around because I love seeing the

326
00:11:33,369 --> 00:11:37,119
facility and learning as much as I can

327
00:11:34,839 --> 00:11:38,649
and I'm like I've kind of it's like a

328
00:11:37,119 --> 00:11:40,178
class you know what I mean like well I

329
00:11:38,649 --> 00:11:41,499
made all the friends I want to make here

330
00:11:40,178 --> 00:11:44,249
and I've learned as much as I can I

331
00:11:41,499 --> 00:11:46,209
think I'm gonna go find another facility

332
00:11:44,249 --> 00:11:47,528
now keeps me really happy

333
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:49,088
I keep they keep accidentally putting

334
00:11:47,528 --> 00:11:52,269
bonuses on my paychecks I can't argue

335
00:11:49,089 --> 00:11:56,639
with them they treat me really well

336
00:11:52,269 --> 00:11:59,918
they're super cool people too you know

337
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:01,389
it's all the wieners wieners everywhere

338
00:11:59,918 --> 00:12:04,688
every nook and cranny you know you can

339
00:12:01,389 --> 00:12:06,489
find us always it's a blast I had we

340
00:12:04,688 --> 00:12:08,078
nerd stuff wrote down to talk about

341
00:12:06,489 --> 00:12:10,869
later but we can go that way if you want

342
00:12:08,078 --> 00:12:12,188
to so let's introduce the people maybe a

343
00:12:10,869 --> 00:12:13,778
lot of my listeners aren't familiar

344
00:12:12,188 --> 00:12:15,969
because people are listening in

345
00:12:13,778 --> 00:12:17,859
Australia and countries I can't even

346
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:21,038
pronounce they glad to assume everyone

347
00:12:17,859 --> 00:12:23,649
knows so there is a guy a group of

348
00:12:21,038 --> 00:12:25,418
people but mainly it's led by the the

349
00:12:23,649 --> 00:12:28,149
ringleader is a dude by the name of sub

350

351
00:12:28,149 --> 00:12:35,528
deleting him so I'm not sure it's I

352
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:36,788
think it's up cool 420 now okay yeah by

353
00:12:35,528 --> 00:12:38,318
the time this episode comes out they

will have deleted a Miller right have a

355
00:12:38,318 --> 00:12:42,818
new account but so his name is sub cool

356

and he runs a seed company called TG a

357
00:12:42,818 --> 00:12:49,208
sub cool seeds TGA stands for the green

358
00:12:45,428 --> 00:12:52,629
Avenger they are known for strains like

359
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:54,488
space clean and vortex and Jillybean

360
00:12:52,629 --> 00:12:58,178
Jillybean actually let's talk about

361
00:12:54,489 --> 00:13:00,759
another member of TGA miss Jill MZ

362
00:12:58,178 --> 00:13:03,369
period Jill made a strain called Jilly

363
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:05,168
bean it's not jelly it's Jilly because

364
00:13:03,369 --> 00:13:07,569
name that named after Miss Jill that is

365
00:13:05,168 --> 00:13:09,158
sub-cooled wife she's a badass girl

366
00:13:07,568 --> 00:13:11,889
she's a cool lady she does some breeding

367
00:13:09,158 --> 00:13:14,558
she made the Bryan berry coffee so that

368
00:13:11,889 --> 00:13:17,318
is part of the the tea GSF cool family

369
00:13:14,558 --> 00:13:18,429
there's also jinx proof who made the

370
00:13:17,318 --> 00:13:20,379
nine pound hammer

371
00:13:18,429 --> 00:13:22,959
he's a crazy chemist I like watching him

372
00:13:20,379 --> 00:13:24,939
grow up Louis yeah he's a really cool

373
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:27,250
dude I love his be positive attitude

374
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:28,960
he's got a child with autism and he also

375
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:31,299
suffers from the seizure condition

376
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:33,220
so his B positive attitude is really

377
00:13:31,299 --> 00:13:35,349
cool to see him use cannabis in a

378
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:36,970
positive way and educate everybody and

379
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:38,379
yeah so shut it to the whole wizard crew

380
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:40,540
but that's who we're talking about is

381
00:13:38,379 --> 00:13:42,458
sub cool is the ringleader of the weed

382
00:13:40,539 --> 00:13:45,250
nerds he's the leader of the TGA sub

383
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:47,409
cool seed company they've also got a

384
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:49,089
side company known as natural homegrown

385
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:52,870
wonders which are some of sub cools best

386
00:13:49,089 --> 00:13:54,910
friends but the weed nerds are so he

387
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:56,350
does a show on YouTube called the wheat

388
00:13:54,909 --> 00:13:57,579
nerd and you can watch him he does a

389
00:13:56,350 --> 00:14:01,509
little head banging he does a little

390
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:03,399
ganja teaching he'll speak his mind it's

391
00:14:01,509 --> 00:14:05,110
so I better give him some credit he kind

392
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:06,610
of inspired this podcast to on accident

393
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:08,709
I think without me even realizing it

394
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:10,180
because it's the same damn format now

395
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:13,000
that I think about it without sub I

396
00:14:10,179 --> 00:14:17,319
wouldn't be I wouldn't be where I am for

397
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:22,720
sure my photography you could tell he

398
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:27,510

cool than his products but go see for

417
00:15:05,169 --> 00:15:08,490

00:15:10,169 --> 00:15:14,169
someone else's look past that and look

419
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,120
to what they're bringing look to their

420
00:15:14,169 --> 00:15:18,099
message and you can learn a lot more a

421
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:20,259
lot of people probably don't realize how

422
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:21,909
many strains sub cool he's brought to

423
00:15:20,259 --> 00:15:24,789
market that are amazing strains plush

424
00:15:21,909 --> 00:15:26,559
mary was a sub cool creation the

425
00:15:24,789 --> 00:15:28,569
original they're bringing her back yes

426
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:29,859
there's some stuff there but yeah a song

427
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:31,740
ice Jun was making a bunch of plush

428
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:33,120
berry seeds recently yeah

429
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:35,190
I've bred with plush berry I had a

430
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:38,310
really cool purple purple phenotype

431
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:45,960
scene that made the black cherry kill

432
00:15:38,309 --> 00:15:48,089
yeah that's Julie bean - so we've been

433
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:49,800
talking on Facebook a little bit and you

434
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:55,230
actually wanted to talk a little bit

435
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:57,029
about LED growing okay um I use the for

436
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:58,740
veg when I'm got a full thing going I

437
00:15:57,029 --> 00:16:01,289
use it because of course it saves power

438
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:02,820
and if you know how to use them you can

439
00:16:01,289 --> 00:16:04,289
use them right you know I know a lot of

440
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:05,760
people who like to put them down real

441
00:16:04,289 --> 00:16:07,409
close to the plant because they think

442
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,569
the closer the better but there's

443
00:16:07,409 --> 00:16:10,919
actually a

444
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:14,129
opportun I guess you want to say range

445
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:15,929
there I think it's 18 to 12 or 18 to 24

446
00:16:14,129 --> 00:16:18,090
inches away from your plant their beans

447
00:16:15,929 --> 00:16:19,349
focus and you can actually tell when

448
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:21,769
you're adjusting your life if you look

449
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:24,750
at the shadow the way the color split

450
00:16:21,769 --> 00:16:26,970
that's and once you do that they just

451
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:28,409
take off em that's actually right with

452
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:30,240
just about every light you have to find

453
00:16:28,409 --> 00:16:32,009
I'll call it the sweet spot yeah like

454
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,480
when you get too close you can probably

455
00:16:32,009 --> 00:16:35,220
tell yourself when you get too close

456
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,629
it's real hot oh yeah when you start

457
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:38,190
backing off a little bit you could tell

458
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:39,269
that's not too hot I can handle it then

459
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:40,560
if you go a little further you like oh

460
00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:42,449
there's not a lot of light on my hand

461
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:44,099
your plants can tell the same damn thing

462
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:45,360
and they want that sweet spot so you got

463
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:49,500
to find that with an LED and you say

464
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:50,550
it's 18 to 24 inches I've been out of my

465
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,590
own grill for a while because I've been

466
00:16:50,549 --> 00:16:55,139
bouncing around but I believe that's

467
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:56,550
what it is okay it looks right to me

468
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:58,529
from what I see in all the pictures a

469
00:16:56,549 --> 00:17:00,149
lot of people don't realize that the

470
00:16:58,529 --> 00:17:03,149
lenses have a different angle I think

471
00:17:00,149 --> 00:17:04,500
there's like 60 90 and 120 so the way

472
00:17:03,149 --> 00:17:06,450
the beam shoots out of the line okay

473
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:08,519
and yeah that's true the 90s of shooting

474
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:09,870
straight down that's what I kind of want

475
00:17:08,519 --> 00:17:11,190
that's what I look for I go for nine

476
00:17:09,869 --> 00:17:12,269
years so I know all that light is just

477
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:14,700
going straight to the play to your

478
00:17:12,269 --> 00:17:15,869
leaves yeah and then if you can take

479
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,549
that into account get what you're going

480
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:18,838
you can do a lot of good with your LEDs

481
00:17:17,549 --> 00:17:20,399
I think a lot of people are either

482
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:22,559
afraid or mad because they don't

483
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,269
understand how to really roll with the

484
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:26,338
LED right because they they bought one

485
00:17:24,269 --> 00:17:27,450
for twenty five dollars off eBay put it

486
00:17:26,338 --> 00:17:28,710
two inches from their planet and their

487
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:30,809
plant did nothing but give them some

488
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:33,509
little bit of frost you know yeah so I

489
00:17:30,809 --> 00:17:35,759
mean people are afraid to try I say do

490
00:17:33,509 --> 00:17:37,379
it okay I say go with it go for it the

491
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:38,430
new it the new plants the lights they

492
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:41,340
have coming out or doing some good

493
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:42,870
things I mean I'm not mister in the LED

494
00:17:41,339 --> 00:17:44,399
light industry but right is there a

495
00:17:42,869 --> 00:17:45,089
brand that you've had good experience

496
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,610
with or a brand

497
00:17:45,089 --> 00:17:50,399
you would recommend to buy my head I

498
00:17:47,609 --> 00:17:51,808
wouldn't want to just ramble I respect

499
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:59,730
that more than you trying to get

500
00:17:51,808 --> 00:18:02,359
something out there you go you said

501
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:04,798
ex-wife earlier you're getting smart

502
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:06,750
never miss an opportunity to keep your

503
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:09,389
mouth shut right there you go all right

504
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:10,710
so what uh is there anything major I'm

505
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:12,390
gonna have to do other than finding that

506
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:14,159
sweet spot and the major difference

507
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:15,720
between growing from an HID like a

508
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:17,970
high-pressure sodium blunder into

509
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,500
watering is good okay because they don't

510
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:20,759
use as much it's not as hot in the room

511
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:23,519
so it doesn't evaporate as much

512
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:25,558
okay watch that I've done it myself got

513
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:28,619
some fungus gnats kick myself in the ass

514
00:18:25,558 --> 00:18:30,898
tirelessly and fungus yeah yeah gotta

515
00:18:28,619 --> 00:18:32,548
watch your watering you got let me see

516
00:18:30,898 --> 00:18:34,918
what else did I adjust from doing that

517
00:18:32,548 --> 00:18:36,658
to that um I guess he was undercut a

518
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:38,490
little more because there's the bottom

519
00:18:36,659 --> 00:18:40,200
just getting the penetration okay so a

520
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:41,460
little what we mean is clean up the

521
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,509
underskirt there's a leaves on the

522
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,288
bottom of the plant that aren't really

523
00:18:42,509 --> 00:18:44,849
necessary

524
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,869
just little shitty growth you guys will

525
00:18:44,849 --> 00:18:48,000
know what I'm talking about it's a

526
00:18:45,869 --> 00:18:49,168
little tiny just crappy veg growth it's

527
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,210
not gonna turn into anything you're

528
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:53,009
gonna have to trim fluffy stuff cut that

529
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:54,600
off of there the energy where that was

530
00:18:53,009 --> 00:18:56,490
being wasted will now go up to the top

531
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:57,778
you'll get a fatter chunkier bud up at

532
00:18:56,490 --> 00:19:00,480
the top of the plant so clean up that

533
00:18:57,778 --> 00:19:01,769
underside sorry excuse me for clearing

534
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,569
the throat you have to clean up the

535
00:19:01,769 --> 00:19:05,129
other underside a little bit more maybe

536
00:19:03,569 --> 00:19:06,178
pull the plants out a little bit more

537
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:08,130
and spread them so you can get more

538
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:10,320
light to them do a little bit more

539
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:12,510
pruning probably like defoliant a little

540
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:14,460
bit and then water a little bit less

541
00:19:12,509 --> 00:19:16,349
frequently you're gonna have to change

542
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:22,759
your feeding other than the amount of

543
00:19:16,349 --> 00:19:22,759
water just a little bit later all right

544
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:30,028
okay I'm kind of like it they like it

545
00:19:28,558 --> 00:19:32,548
rough I think treating them a little bit

546
00:19:30,028 --> 00:19:34,259
rough the plants there they're meant to

547
00:19:32,548 --> 00:19:35,879
be outside they grow yeah I've said it

548
00:19:34,259 --> 00:19:38,158
before they grow on a rock like Afghan

549
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:40,110
plants in Afghanistan they've grown a

550
00:19:38,159 --> 00:19:41,730
rocky mountainside where the wind would

551
00:19:40,109 --> 00:19:43,379
blow on it and the Sun would beat on it

552
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:45,149
and it's get rained on and a goat would

553
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:46,620
piss on it like these plants are meant

554
00:19:45,148 --> 00:19:51,359
to be durable you know to be they're not

555
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:52,889
a [ __ ] plant because weed for a reason

556
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:54,509
is what Mike always says anywhere

557
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:56,309
anywhere if you're doing it you can if

558
00:19:54,509 --> 00:19:57,119
even if you have to try it almost kill

559
00:19:56,308 --> 00:19:59,250
this plant

560
00:19:57,119 --> 00:20:01,589
yeah totally you have to put it through

561
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:02,730
some stuff or I mean it may it may spit

562
00:20:01,589 --> 00:20:04,319
out some seeds you don't want it but

563
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:06,720
it's still gonna survive the stress you

564
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:07,919
give it absolutely uh-huh yeah so okay

565
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,470
so you're dragging it right from the

566
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:12,539
LEDs under the HIDs is it gonna get

567
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:14,850
straight does it grow more stretchy or

568
00:20:12,539 --> 00:20:16,920
just a bushier with the LEDs it'll start

569
00:20:14,849 --> 00:20:18,509
to compact more and get more bush that's

570
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:20,400
it that's why I like it I'll give it a

571
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:22,500
couple weeks a little bit a little bit

572
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,780
more [ __ ] under the LED before I mean

573
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:26,369
the hid before I flip it and give it put

574
00:20:24,779 --> 00:20:27,779
it into flour just get him a little bit

575
00:20:26,369 --> 00:20:29,609
more used to the light you notice a

576
00:20:27,779 --> 00:20:32,639
stretch is it stretch at that point the

577
00:20:29,609 --> 00:20:33,869
stretches I don't know maybe it depends

578
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,270
of what I'm doing I try to keep him real

579
00:20:33,869 --> 00:20:45,599
small so cuz what's nice are you using

580
00:20:36,269 --> 00:20:48,539
just a curiosity little pots I'm

581
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:50,069
actually running a fee no excuse Mickey

582
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:51,779
burp and I keep drinking dr. pepper to

583
00:20:50,069 --> 00:20:53,428
try to get rid of the dab throughout

584
00:20:51,779 --> 00:20:55,049
hairnets that's making a terrible combo

585
00:20:53,429 --> 00:20:57,660
of herbs and throat clearing I apologize

586
00:20:55,049 --> 00:20:58,889
I'm doing a fee no Han Solo cups and

587
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:00,300
I've just got them in a little tray so

588
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:02,220
that I can water the tray and it absorbs

589
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:03,750
the water but it's working pretty well

590
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:06,450
I've never done it like that but you can

591
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:08,519
fit you can fit 28 cups in one of these

592
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:09,960
trays and then I eliminated close to

593
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:11,308
half of them because they're male and

594
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:13,500
female you know I pulled the boys out so

595
00:21:11,308 --> 00:21:15,359
there's like 14 or 15 males per tray and

596
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:17,220
they fit beautifully in there and I just

597
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:18,959
pour water in the tray look he's got him

598
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:20,460
in Solo cups and I love a tiny girl like

599
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,410
that everybody every day once in a while

600
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:23,880
I like to do a solo cup challenge when I

601
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:25,230
was on the forums that's always one get

602
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,179
a bunch of people go in a whole plant

603
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:29,640
and I saw little cups you can do yeah

604
00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:31,080
but maybe depend on how long I let them

605
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,490
go to three inches they'll stretch it

606
00:21:31,079 --> 00:21:34,470
real nice real quick for me and okay

607
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:37,259
then I'll flip them alright it's more of

608
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:38,970
I guess it's more of a height thing for

609
00:21:37,259 --> 00:21:41,490
me than a time thing I've never put

610
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:43,350
anything on a timer or anything I try to

611
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:45,929
have a height schedule but I just broke

612
00:21:43,349 --> 00:21:47,490
my schedule by seven by five days a

613
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:49,740
couple of days ago because like these

614
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:50,789
plants are too tall okay just watching

615
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:52,769
them was like no these must go into

616
00:21:50,789 --> 00:21:54,240
flower now the grower and me kicked in I

617
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:55,710
was I forget to schedule these plants

618
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,269
have to fall right I guess I turned an

619
00:21:55,710 --> 00:22:01,110
Orisha fear in my head I just realized

620
00:21:57,269 --> 00:22:02,549
but I got a flower these plants I never

621
00:22:01,109 --> 00:22:04,500
I just listened to the plant that's all

622
00:22:02,549 --> 00:22:05,859
I've ever done schedules are fine for a

623
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,970
good little

624
00:22:05,859 --> 00:22:09,398
the plan will tell you what it needs

625
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:10,929
what it wants to do yeah can't can't do

626
00:22:09,398 --> 00:22:12,488
what it doesn't want to do so yeah of

627
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:13,809
course it you can't you can force it to

628
00:22:12,489 --> 00:22:16,629
flower that's about the only thing I can

629
00:22:13,808 --> 00:22:18,339
force it to do I've learned to force it

630
00:22:16,628 --> 00:22:21,189
to do some [ __ ] of first girls into boys

631
00:22:18,339 --> 00:22:22,928
anyway the speaking of I just dragged

632
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:24,278
plants into flower you guys just to give

633
00:22:22,929 --> 00:22:26,619
you kind of an update on some new [ __ ]

634
00:22:24,278 --> 00:22:28,690
I'm trying I recently purchased the

635
00:22:26,618 --> 00:22:31,509
entire set up of veg blue I got the base

636
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:33,940
newts I got the life I got the shine and

637
00:22:31,509 --> 00:22:36,759
I got the push foliar spray and I just

638
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:38,470
put some grateful dog plants in to

639
00:22:36,759 --> 00:22:41,009
flower and they are getting fed the full

640
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:43,389
veg bloom plus a little bit of aminos

641
00:22:41,009 --> 00:22:44,919
from photosynthesis plus plus

642
00:22:43,388 --> 00:22:48,219
occasionally they're getting a little

643
00:22:44,919 --> 00:22:49,929
bit of humble honey is what they're

644
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:51,429
getting fed for carbohydrates and that

645
00:22:49,929 --> 00:22:53,619

kill the swelling and all that so that's

857
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:55,739
okay I learned that from my grandma

858
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:55,739
[Music]

859
00:30:56,619 --> 00:31:00,709
they're probably they're cooking

860
00:30:58,339 --> 00:31:02,480
together showing the recipes okay

861
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:03,710
talking about chefs being good growers

862
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,150
that's where I was Jesus I threw myself

863
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:08,930
away talking about our grandmas that was

864
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:09,980
weird yeah we liked it when we Grandma

865
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:11,960
ramble yes

866
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:13,730
so chefs are good growers and breeders

867
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:15,230
do you think there's anything about that

868
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:19,549
is that the flavor or is that the work

869
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:20,750
ethic attention to detail I'm glad you

870
00:31:19,549 --> 00:31:23,149
said that cuz I made some notes and that

871
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:25,640
wasn't one of the things I wrote if

872
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:27,019
you're well if you're a chef I'm not

873
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:28,340
gonna get on that whole cake cause

874
00:31:27,019 --> 00:31:30,200
they're cooking a chef or two things but

875
00:31:28,339 --> 00:31:31,490
if you got to put plates together you

876
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,840
got to get down into it and get

877
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:34,039
everything together and get the good

878
00:31:32,839 --> 00:31:35,720
flavors coming out you gotta pay

879
00:31:34,039 --> 00:31:37,730
attention to every detail every detail

880
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:39,259
everything have to look at every tomato

881
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:41,079
when you slice it make sure it's not a

882
00:31:39,259 --> 00:31:43,640
little bit mushy or a little too hard

883
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:44,899
the chef de cuisine for a five-star

884
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:46,580
establishment at one point you know

885
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:49,670
that's why I call myself a chef because

886
00:31:46,579 --> 00:31:50,990
I was a chef but um it was fun they gave

887
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:52,700
me my whole kitchen to run I was in

888
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:55,849
charge of everything but it was my

889
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:56,779
artwork on a plate so you had to be

890
00:31:55,849 --> 00:31:58,849
there someone didn't do it right

891
00:31:56,779 --> 00:32:01,160
watch out cuz here comes Sam you know

892
00:31:58,849 --> 00:32:02,480
you know that's just how it is you know

893
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,950
you got to be a perfectionist you got to

894
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,480
do that and that just transfers over to

895
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:06,890
the world of growing super simple and

896
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:08,089
it's easier in the grow because you

897
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:09,710
don't have a time limit to do it you

898
00:32:08,089 --> 00:32:12,289
know I gotta get this plate up in this

899
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:13,700
amount of time right so I think chefs

900
00:32:12,289 --> 00:32:15,049
can make the adjustment better and be

901
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:16,670
better at this because it's less stress

902
00:32:15,049 --> 00:32:18,109
and it's the same amount of work and the

903
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:20,090
same amount of fun if you're that kind

904
00:32:18,109 --> 00:32:21,619
of crazy yeah yeah that kind of crazy I

905
00:32:20,089 --> 00:32:23,599
like that because you write all of the

906
00:32:21,619 --> 00:32:25,369
chef's I've worked with several several

907
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:28,099
chefs in the cannabis industry and I

908
00:32:25,369 --> 00:32:29,539
have several chef friends everybody that

909
00:32:28,099 --> 00:32:31,129
works in the kitchen loves to consume

910
00:32:29,539 --> 00:32:33,289
some cannabis before nearing end or

911
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:34,700
after work so I am associated with a lot

912
00:32:33,289 --> 00:32:36,829
of people in a kitchen environment they

913
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:38,600
are all that special kind of craziness

914
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:40,189
they can work a 12-hour shift and then

915
00:32:38,599 --> 00:32:41,990
drink for eight hours right after work

916
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:43,279
and then sleep for like four hours and

917
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:45,289
be back at it tomorrow and I'm like how

918
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:47,029
the hell do you guys do that it's hot in

919
00:32:45,289 --> 00:32:48,379
there when your house side the kitchen

920
00:32:47,029 --> 00:32:50,299
with the chef you'll hear him saying I

921
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:51,980
hate the kitchen yeah but you get them

922
00:32:50,299 --> 00:32:54,529
in that kitchen get get that pressure

923
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:56,059
going and every chef loves that there's

924
00:32:54,529 --> 00:32:58,160
something about that pressure I love

925
00:32:56,059 --> 00:32:59,179
working I'm not I'm no good in the

926
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,830
kitchen I know I wouldn't know the first

927
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:02,250
thing I'm lost in a kitchen you'd throw

928
00:33:00,829 --> 00:33:04,649
me the hell out I'd cut myself

929
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:06,119
/ quickly but I love pressure I would

930
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:07,980
like to work under pressure I noticed

931
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:10,049
myself the guys at work look at me like

932
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:11,339
you should probably slow down because

933
00:33:10,049 --> 00:33:13,549
we're gonna be out of work by noon if

934
00:33:11,339 --> 00:33:16,439
you keep going that fast

935
00:33:13,549 --> 00:33:17,549
yeah turbo is the way to go so much fun

936
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:19,019
getting work done and then you look back

937
00:33:17,549 --> 00:33:21,000
and you're like leave all this [ __ ] I

938
00:33:19,019 --> 00:33:22,710
just got done you're covered in sweat

939
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,970
and your back hurts but you're like yeah

940
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:31,640
and all the other guys are trying to

941
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:34,680
catch up like I've got puddle buckets in

942
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:36,450
yeah five tables behind you so yeah I

943
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,740
think I think chefs make great growers

944
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:39,090
and breeders that work I think that

945
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:45,960
attention to detail I was gonna say the

946
00:33:39,089 --> 00:33:47,009
cleanliness I mean sick from a non clean

947
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:49,380
restaurant before I don't want to do

948
00:33:47,009 --> 00:33:53,269
that again it's hard out I'm sure it's

949
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:56,490
not because yeah but it's mainly because

950
00:33:53,269 --> 00:34:03,509
it's not perfect I'm pretty mad my

951
00:33:56,490 --> 00:34:04,680
daughters are always like dad right it's

952
00:34:03,509 --> 00:34:08,750
the hardest thing just to keep your

953
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:08,750
mouth shut not that I bowled out like

954
00:34:12,949 --> 00:34:18,569
it's good ladies like that ya know just

955
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,669
I guess I'm different I just silently

956
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:23,129
eat in and get a bit leave thanks for

957
00:34:20,668 --> 00:34:25,259
that shitty food I'm not coming back I

958
00:34:23,128 --> 00:34:31,168
used to be like that till I got deep

959
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:33,149
into my chef I know it's already it

960
00:34:31,168 --> 00:34:36,089
almost any restaurant where we live

961
00:34:33,148 --> 00:34:37,259
around here it's all like pre-prepared

962
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:39,389
you know what I mean most restaurants

963
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:40,740
now pre-prep they just got to go in

964
00:34:39,389 --> 00:34:42,450
there and pour the bags into the thing

965
00:34:40,739 --> 00:34:44,128
and put the right sauce on top of it

966
00:34:42,449 --> 00:34:45,898
bring it out you know like you couldn't

967
00:34:44,128 --> 00:34:48,710
even put the three bags together and

976
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:08,490
Oh sort of a look when I came in of

978
00:35:08,489 --> 00:35:11,849

979
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:13,410
restaurant I get I get the look I had my

980
00:35:11,849 --> 00:35:14,559
dreads tied up but they could still they

981
00:35:13,409 --> 00:35:16,029
still looked at me like whoa

982
00:35:14,559 --> 00:35:19,119
and I had bright red eyes cuz I just

983
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:20,830
took in a takin a dab in the car but

984
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:21,579
they served us what do they call

985
00:35:20,829 --> 00:35:24,340
raviolis

986
00:35:21,579 --> 00:35:26,710
as an appetizer but the plate came with

987
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:28,420
I don't know what it was it was a white

988
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:29,920
colored sauce with a dark colored swirl

989
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:31,150
and it was real fancy looking I just

990
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,639
smacked the microphone making a swirl

991
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:34,539
and then it had the raviolis on top of

992
00:35:33,639 --> 00:35:36,849
that and there was a little side of

993
00:35:34,539 --> 00:35:38,739
marinara and a side of another sauce and

994
00:35:36,849 --> 00:35:40,029
then they'd put like fresh parmesan or

995
00:35:38,739 --> 00:35:41,469
something on top of it I was like that

996
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:43,390
looks [ __ ] delicious I'm gonna grab

997
00:35:41,469 --> 00:35:46,029
me one of them I took a bite out of it

998
00:35:43,389 --> 00:35:47,829
and I'm 95% sure that it is the same

999
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:49,390
frozen ravioli that I bought at Sam's

1000
00:35:47,829 --> 00:35:52,420
Club that I had with my freezer over

1001
00:35:49,389 --> 00:35:54,429
there and I felt embarrassed for myself

1002
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:57,460
for getting excited like oh that's a

1003
00:35:54,429 --> 00:35:58,899
[ __ ] but you were fooled yeah and

1004
00:35:57,460 --> 00:36:01,000
then I feel bad for the whole restaurant

1005
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:05,619
I was like oh wait they just lost all

1006
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:07,599
credibility to me it's an industry-wide

1007
00:36:05,619 --> 00:36:08,769
thing and that you know it sucks because

1008
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:10,179
people are going out there thinking

1009
00:36:08,769 --> 00:36:12,869
they're gonna get this great meal when

1010
00:36:10,179 --> 00:36:16,059
you can go to Walmart and pick it up and

1011
00:36:12,869 --> 00:36:18,099
you know yeah I probably could have

1012
00:36:16,059 --> 00:36:22,750
microwave those things myself and not ya

1013
00:36:18,099 --> 00:36:23,860
know why I charge so much when you're

1014
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:25,389
just doing something that someone can do

1015
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:26,980
for themselves maybe you can do a little

1016
00:36:25,389 --> 00:36:28,659
better and make it taste better so what

1017
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:30,909
don't charge so much get more people

1018
00:36:28,659 --> 00:36:32,559
than have fun yeah everybody Bunton was

1019
00:36:30,909 --> 00:36:33,730
money hungry so I don't see eye to eye

1020
00:36:32,559 --> 00:36:34,539
with a lot of people that's why I jumped

1021
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:36,730
out to be in the show

1022
00:36:34,539 --> 00:36:38,679
I got tired of working working working

1023
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:39,909
to put money in other people's pockets

1024
00:36:38,679 --> 00:36:42,039
when they were keeping me on the mum

1025
00:36:39,909 --> 00:36:43,599
wage and stuff so it was like thank God

1026

00:39:06,809 --> 00:39:11,670
podcasting this podcast is always going

1093

you were able or if you would like to or

1098
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,809
if you feel like this podcast was worth

1099
00:39:20,489 --> 00:39:23,489
a couple of bucks all you have to do is

1100

heart you can contribute as little as $1

offset the cost of my website my website

1112
00:39:43,449 --> 00:39:47,259

1113

every year and that is where I host this

1114
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:51,430
podcast so to keep it free without

1115
