you know he is a big smoker he usually

106
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:40,878
hangs out with the crowd uh because of

107
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,039
the quarantine conditions because of

108
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:44,798
kovid he's chosen to protect himself he

109
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:46,719
wasn't smoking with anybody i chose to

110
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,239
respect that so we didn't hang out

111
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:49,840
before the show like normal but when he

112
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,680
walked on stage he made sure to wave to

113
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,959
me uh he made me stand up and show the

114
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,280
crowd my dreadlocks that was a little

115
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,878
bit interesting uh he realized my buddy

116
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,158
baker was the guy sitting next to me

117
00:03:56,878 --> 00:03:59,919
eventually and he's like oh hey dude

118
00:03:58,158 --> 00:04:01,359
didn't realize that was you that was

119
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:02,798
kind of funny but

120
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,840
at the end of the show

121
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:07,599
i tried not to impose uh on doug benson

122
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,519
i knew he wanted some privacy but i was

123
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:11,438
invited to go say hello after i popped

124
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,840
into the green room said hello then i

125
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:15,438
quickly excused myself i knew doug was

126
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,879
trying to protect himself and not try to

127
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:18,719
get sick and not be around a lot of

128
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:20,319
people so i threw a fist bump i threw

129
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,840
some high fives and i said hey it's

130
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:22,800
crowded in the green room i'm out of

131
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,879
here

132
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,319
there was a young man in that green room

133
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:28,000
who um we're not going to get too

134
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:29,519
political but he's not into the mask

135
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,879
thing he finds it silly that's not what

136
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:34,799
he's doing so when i uh politely excused

137
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:36,879
myself from the green room shortly after

138
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,400
that he came out to smoke with me since

139
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:40,959
everybody smoking in the green room was

140
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:42,560
kind of a mask person so the guy that

141
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:44,799
followed me outside and ended up smoking

142
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,319
a big 14 gram joint of the cream with me

143
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,639
was this comedian you might have seen on

144
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:50,879
tv his name was josh blue

145
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,960
that was a really good experience

146
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:54,959
because i excused myself from that green

147
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:56,959
room and tried not to impose and mix

148
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:59,439
myself up into that crowd i ended up

149
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:01,439
smoking a big fat joint with josh blue

150
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:03,199
sometimes life just works itself out for

151
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:05,199
you that was a blessing josh blue of

152
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,038
course was just on america's got talent

153
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:09,680
he is the the comedian with cerebral

154
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:11,279
palsy not trying to be rude but uh if

155
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,600
you ever pass a joint to a guy with

156
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:15,439
cerebral palsy be [ __ ] patient trying

157
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,600
to get that thing back had to chase it

158
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:19,279
down that's just a joke i'd sit in front

159
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,039
of him he makes fun of his palsy arm

160
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:22,799
it's [ __ ] hilarious but really he had

161
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:24,079
to chase it down his palsy arm just went

162
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,520
out of control and he had the joint in

163
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:27,199
the palsy arm i'm like well no i'm never

164
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:29,038

165
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,160
chase it that was a funny joke i looked

166
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:31,839
him right in the eye and shook my head

167
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,639
like you [ __ ] you put it in that

168
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:36,478
hand because he knew better he was i'm

169
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,840

170
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:39,599
his paul's yarn was out of control and

171
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:41,439

00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,520
let's talk about cannabis growing let's

204

talk about a few ways to save you money

205
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:46,560
in your grow space i do offer

206
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:48,399
professional commercial cultivation

207
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,918
consulting services

208
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:52,318
one of the things that i talk about when

209
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:53,839
i go to a commercial cultivation to do a

210
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,919
consultation those are a lot of words

211
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:58,399
together but when i go to do that one of

212
00:06:55,918 --> 00:07:01,359
the things i focus on is increasing

213
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:03,839
productivity or reducing costs by about

214
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:06,160
30 percent i know i can save some money

215
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:08,399
i know i can increase cost can i do both

216
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,560
enough to increase productivity and

217
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:12,719
reduce costs by 30 percent that is a

218
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,399
huge goal in a commercial facility if

219
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,479
you can increase productivity by 30

220
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:17,839
percent that's 30 percent more money

221
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:19,598
you're gonna make which will really help

222
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:21,279
out right now a lot of commercial

223
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:23,680
facilities in colorado are barely

224
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:26,159
scraping even so we've got to make every

225
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,000
dollar count this also counts when

226
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,000
you're working in your own home grow if

227
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,598
you've got one light if you've got four

228
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,439
lights if you've got a 12 lighter in

229
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:35,839
your garage however you're doing it

230
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:38,079
every dollar counts especially in the

231
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:39,839
situation we are in i don't know how the

232
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:41,279
pandemic treated you maybe you made some

233
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:43,519
money maybe you went broke maybe you're

234
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:45,758
scraping by it doesn't matter everybody

235
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:47,279
can save a few bucks if you have money

236
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,720
and you save a few bucks you have more

237
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:50,799
money if you barely have any money and

238
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,720
you save a few bucks maybe you can use

239
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,120
those dollars to improve on something in

240
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,800
your life or in your garden so let me

241
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,840
get my high ass on track and let's talk

242
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,598
about some ways to save money in your

243
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:03,439
grow space

244
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:05,680
first of all in a commercial environment

245
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:07,918
one of the things i focus on is is your

246
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,840
building the appropriate size did you

247
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:11,120
buy a big ass warehouse thinking you're

248
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:13,038
going to load it up with lights and

249
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,598
plants and then you're only using a

250
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:18,240
small portion of that real estate is

251
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:20,639
expensive space is expensive every

252
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,879
square foot of your cultivation space

253
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,120
costs you money use it if you're not

254
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:27,680
using it you're wasting space that is a

255
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,918
big void do you wanna if i gave you a

256
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,598
cooler and i said put weed in the cooler

257
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:33,120
are you gonna put weed in some of the

258
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:35,519
space in that cooler are you gonna fill

259
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,519
the whole cooler with weed do that with

260
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,599
your grow environment fill that [ __ ] up

261
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,399
or you are wasting space maximize your

262
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,399
output

263
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,240
of course you do need processing area

264
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,240
trimming area working area but you get

265
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,680
the point if you've got some dark area a

266
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,959
room that's not even being used if

267
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:51,359
you're storing [ __ ] in there just

268
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:54,079
because it's empty utilize that room do

269
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:57,039
something with it make it pay for itself

270
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:59,040
real estate square footage is expensive

271
00:08:57,039 --> 00:09:01,360
and that matters in any grow if you're

272
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:04,159
running a commercial grow a five by five

273
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:06,320
tent a three by three tent be economical

274
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:08,159
be cost effective with your space use

275
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,000
every square foot of space that you've

276
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:12,240
got you paid for it even if it's a tent

277
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,559
you bought a five by five tent use the

278
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,560
five by five i see people setting up a

279
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:18,159
trellis in a five by five and they're

280
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:19,679
allowed to grow three plants or four

281
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:21,278
plants in their legal location so

282
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:23,679
they'll put four plants in there but

283
00:09:21,278 --> 00:09:25,200
they don't veg it out to fill that tent

284
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:26,639
so even if you're running a three by

285
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,800
three fill it up if you're running a

286
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:31,278
five by five fill it up veg long enough

287
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:34,000
to utilize that space i see a lot of

288
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:35,838
wasted space in a lot of grow tents and

289
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,919
think of it this way sometimes it's

290
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:40,320
illegal where people are growing are you

291
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:41,679
going to grow just enough to get by or

292
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,200
are you going to grow enough to [ __ ]

293
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:44,799
make it worth it because if you get in

294
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,800
trouble you're getting in trouble either

295
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:48,159
way if you've got a plant and it's kind

296
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:49,679
of this big or if you've got a plant

297
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:51,838
it's this [ __ ] big and it's in your

298
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:53,519
house it's gonna be the same charge go

299
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:56,320
big or go the [ __ ] home and make it

300
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,759
worth it fill your space so real estate

301
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,160
is one of the number one things that i

302
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:02,559
see people wasting in any grow fill your

303
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:04,879
tent fill your commercial growth then

304
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:06,559
another thing that i see when those

305
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:07,838
rooms are filled they're only filled

306
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:10,159
with lights they're not filled with

307
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,680
plants and the lights are running

308
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:13,439
just like your mama says just like your

309
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:14,879
dad says if that light isn't on for a

310
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,800
reason turn it the [ __ ] off if you're

311
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:18,480
not in that room turn the light off if

312
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:20,479
there are not plants underneath that

313
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,560
light turn the light off why is that

314
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,240
light running for no plants it looks

315
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:25,759
cool yeah you got the whole room lit up

316
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,919
all the workspace is bright it looks

317
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:29,919
like a big productivity area but you're

318
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:31,599
just burning lumens wasting your bulb

319
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:33,199
running electricity the kilowatts are

320
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,800
just spinning on the meter outside

321
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,120
you're not getting anything from it

322
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:38,719
except a little bit more heat you're

323
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,078
running lights that are unnecessary

324
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,920
you're creating more heat which means

325
00:10:40,078 --> 00:10:43,599
you need to run more fans which will

326
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:45,439
also mean you probably need more air

327
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,079
conditioning which are all sucking more

328
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,600
kilowatts that you don't need so think

329
00:10:48,078 --> 00:10:52,399
about the equipment you do not need

330
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,800
that's running right now and turn it off

331
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,320
maybe you've got plants too far apart i

332
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:57,679
like to plant i like the plants to have

333
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,519
some space they need some breathing room

334
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:01,278
they don't need to be crowded but do you

335
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,360
have plants too far spread apart

336
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:05,679
unnecessarily to where you've got extra

337
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:08,000
lights on can you possibly turn off that

338
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:09,599
row of lights move all those plants over

339
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,360
and wait for them to grow a little bit

340
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,360
and then when they're bigger then we'll

341
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,360
use more light that may be something

342
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,720
that you're uh not thinking about

343
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,879
something else to think about move the

344
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,680
plants closer together that's easier to

345
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:24,078
do if you are using smaller pots are you

346
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:26,399
using the right size pot i like to use

347
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:28,078
graduated pot sizes which means i start

348
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,839
off in a so you go from a cloner right

349
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:31,679
you got your clone domes or your clone

350
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,279
however many of those [ __ ] cram those

351
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:34,559
under a light as soon as they go into

352
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:35,919
the small pots you can get them pretty

353
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:38,000
close together your plants are only

354
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:39,679
three inches tall three inches wide why

355
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,360
do they need a lot of space cram a lot

356
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:43,439
of those together put them under the

357
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,278
light then as soon as they start growing

358
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,279
spread them out make them comfortable

359
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:49,039
but don't give them two or three lights

360
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:49,919
until you need to run two or three

361
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:52,000
lights

362
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:53,278
ah this isn't as big of a deal in a

363
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,720
small grow but once you get into a

364
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:57,519
commercial environment when i'm saying

365
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:00,320
one or three lights that means 10 15 20

366
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:02,720
lights that adds up quite quickly

367
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,480
so do you have unnecessary lighting that

368
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,759
is running are your plants in small

369
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,399
enough pots where you can push them

370
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:10,720
together and save some space until it is

371
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,559
time to add though the bigger pots and

372
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,160
the extra lighting now something that

373
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:15,838
will save you some more money if you're

374
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:18,480
running smaller pots is you obviously

375
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,600
don't need as much soil or cocoa as soon

376
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,440
you're going to need it later but you

377
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,360
don't need it now you can save some

378
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,040
money now

379
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,480
money comes and goes it you may not have

380
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:28,639
all the money right now you may have it

381
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,560
later to buy more soil for bigger pots

382
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,320
so you can use smaller pots for now

383
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:33,599
until you get that next paycheck maybe

384
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,600
do whatever you need to do to make the

385
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,519
next few bucks then you put them in

386
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,120
bigger pots then you have to spread them

387
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:41,120
apart further put them under more light

388
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,560
but then you need to water them more so

389
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,320
if you put them in a smaller pot they

390
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:47,439
don't need as much water they don't need

391
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,959
as much nutrients also that takes less

392
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,279
time and we're going to talk about that

393
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:52,958
here toward the end of the show so one

394
00:12:51,278 --> 00:12:54,879
quick thing you can think about is pot

395
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:57,278
size am i using too big of a pot too

396
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:59,200
early can i keep these plants in smaller

397
00:12:57,278 --> 00:13:01,360
pots keep them closer together and keep

398
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,800
less light on and that may save you some

399
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,879
money that could save you a lot of money

400
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:06,719
just the water the nutrients the time

401
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:08,240
the light then that equals more air

402
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,920
conditioning and fans that you can turn

403
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,680
off that is one quick thing that can

404
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:14,479
save you a few bucks consolidate the

405
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:16,000
plants under less lights no matter what

406
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,440
kind of lights you're running they do

407
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,200
cost money even if they are high

408
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,560
efficient led lights they they're

409
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,560
costing you money they're generating

410
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:24,078
heat they're making more equipment run

411
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:25,919
and the bigger pots if you're using

412
00:13:24,078 --> 00:13:28,319
bigger pots unnecessarily it takes more

413
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:30,240
water takes more nutrients takes more ph

414
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,160
up or ph down takes you longer to mix

415
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,799
takes you longer to water the water

416
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:36,559
costs money it all adds up if you really

417
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:38,399
pay attention and think about it now

418
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:40,638
let's talk about some of your ancillary

419
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:42,480
gear how are your dehumidifier and

420
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,240
humidifiers running are they on too

421
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,039
frequently are they on often enough are

422
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,879
they on unnecessarily sometimes i

423
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:51,120
recommend putting them on to battle each

424
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:53,278
other uh in a dry and cure environment i

425
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,519
will set them both at 55 and just let

426
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:57,519
them fight so that it stays at 55 all

427
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,959
day in that room but that isn't a

428
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:01,278
commercial environment where it is

429
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:03,759
critical that we keep those conditions

430
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:05,360
do you have gear running unnecessarily

431
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:07,198
do you can you turn some of it off now

432
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,199
that we've turned off some of the lights

433
00:14:07,198 --> 00:14:11,278
will that help you out have you cleaned

434
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:13,120
the filters in those devices because

435
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:15,519
when those filters get dirty they are

436
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,959
not as efficient that is also true with

437
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,879
your air conditioner have you cleaned

438
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:20,719
your air conditioning filters if they're

439
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:22,159
dirty they're sucking up some of your

440
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,000
efficiency you're not getting as much

441
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:26,159
air flow the motors are running they're

442
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,600
struggling you're wasting money you're

443
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:28,958
not getting the air in the cooling that

444
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,560
you think you're getting but you are

445
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:33,838
putting out the electricity and the

446
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:35,599
stress on your gear which is costing you

447
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,199
money so now that we're talking about

448
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,600
air conditioning let's talk about

449
00:14:37,198 --> 00:14:41,838
ducting are you running ducting do you

450
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,519
have vented lights do you have a carbon

451
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,440
filter that's blowing air out you have

452
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:48,078
some sort of air coming in

453
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:51,440
ducting every time you put a bend in

454
00:14:48,078 --> 00:14:54,319
your ducting it becomes less efficient

455
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:56,399
every time you put a curve a kink a bend

456
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,399
or a twist in that ducting you are

457
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:00,240
slowing down the amount of air and the

458
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:02,078
speed of the air the volume of air which

459
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,799
can move through that duct you are

460
00:15:02,078 --> 00:15:07,120
lessening the efficiency efficacy

461
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:09,679
efficiency of the fan the blower that

462
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:12,000
you're using to blow that air through

463
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:14,319
that ducting so if you straighten it out

464
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,399
a little bit you could probably use uh

465
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,079
save a few kilowatts use a little less

466
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:20,159
bucks use a little less power to move

467
00:15:18,078 --> 00:15:21,439
more air of course i understand ducks

468
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:24,480
need to be bent that's why we get the

469
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:26,800
flexi duct [ __ ] does happen but maybe

470
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:29,600
unnecessary curves and [ __ ] maybe unex

471
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:31,198
necessary duct length can be minimized

472
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,879
uh one thing you do have to keep in mind

473
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:34,399
though is if you're using the lights

474
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:36,399
with the ducted hoods you do need to

475
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,078
kind of keep the light from coming in if

476
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,000
you've got sunshine or another light or

477
00:15:38,078 --> 00:15:42,239
something so you may need those bins i

478
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,799
understand but try to minimize and

479
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:47,198
mitigate those excessive bends

480
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:50,078
if you are using the lights that have

481
00:15:47,198 --> 00:15:51,838
the glass between so there's a bulb and

482
00:15:50,078 --> 00:15:53,758
glass and your canopy that way the heat

483
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:56,320
doesn't get down into your grow you duck

484
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:58,560
that heat out clean that glass that

485
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,320
glass being dirty will suck up your

486
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:02,000
lumens if the light can't get through

487
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,839
it's not getting to your plants you are

488
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,519
wasting money you're paying for it the

489
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,959
lights are burning the lights are hot

490
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,879
and you're just [ __ ] blocking it with

491
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:10,879
your pesticide that got sprayed up on

492
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:12,720
that glass there not even making it to

493
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:14,159
your plants something else we can think

494
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,160
about when it comes to ducting that i

495
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:18,000
almost overlooked is where are you

496
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:20,159
running your ducting are you wasting

497
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,600
that heat if you're running that hot air

498
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:23,519
right outside of the house and it's the

499
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,000
winter maybe consider dumping that heat

500
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:28,000
into the office into a bedroom somewhere

501
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,440
that you want to heat up anyway maybe

502
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,278
then you can turn off the heater and the

503
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,880
rest of the house you can just dump your

504
00:16:31,278 --> 00:16:34,480
grow room heat right into your bedroom

505
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:36,159
and then you don't even have to run the

506
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,360
heater that will save you a few bucks

507
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:39,600
use the heat that's already being

508
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,600
created sometimes i will dump the heat

509
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,600
from my bedroom into my flower space

510
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,360
when the lights go off uh because in the

511
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,440
winter the flower room will get colder

512
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,879
but the bedroom stays on so we just run

513
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,959
the heat from there into the flower

514
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:52,958
space it keeps the flower space nice and

515
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:55,198
warm so think about where you're running

516
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:56,958
your heat are you wasting it are you

517
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:58,879
pulling cold air from somewhere and not

518
00:16:56,958 --> 00:17:00,399
sending it somewhere that it needs to be

519
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:02,559
really think about where you're moving

520
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:04,240
your air you're moving temperature air

521
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:06,318
move it to where you want it maybe you

522
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,480
can use it recycle that air warm up a

523
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:10,639
room cool down a room i don't know your

524
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,318
environment your situation but there are

525
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,799
a lot of options that will come up where

526
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:17,119
you can utilize the air the heat the

527
00:17:14,798 --> 00:17:18,959
cool that comes from the grow space now

528
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:21,399
let's segue back into talking about

529
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:24,640
space are you wasting space with

530
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:26,559
unnecessary plants fortunately and

531
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,400
unfortunately i am limited by the state

532
00:17:26,558 --> 00:17:29,200
of colorado of how many plants i could

533
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,120
have

534
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,759
that kind of helps me out because i

535
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:35,359
could have hoarder tendencies if i were

536
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:37,359
unlimited on plants i would have a lot

537
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:38,558
of mother plants being a breeder

538
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:40,319
somebody who likes to create new

539
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:42,879
genetics and have a large library of

540
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:44,879
genetics to create and also a large

541
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,640
library to smoke from i would have a lot

542
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,720
of plants if i weren't limited so it's

543
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:52,000
kind of a good thing that the state does

544
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:54,079
limit me every plant in my garden has a

545
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
purpose i've got mother plants i've got

546
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:57,759
father plants and then of course i've

547
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,359
got my plants that are in bloom that are

548
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:01,279
seeded and i've got my father plant in

549
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:03,359
there dumping the pollen so i've got

550
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:05,599
very select plants that all have a

551
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:08,159
purpose do you have plants that you're

552
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:09,599
not exactly sure your plan their goal

553
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,200
why are they sticking around i kind of

554
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:13,439
just like that one because that strain

555
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,759
is cool is that strain worth of [ __ ]

556
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,880
does it produce is it a quality strain

557
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:18,879
are you just keeping that plan around

558
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:21,360
for nostalgia because of the name

559
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,440
because of a cool story it's got to meet

560
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:25,038
goals it's got to meet a criteria it's

561
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,640
got to meet a quota does it give you

562
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:28,640
enough product when you grow it does it

563
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,559
take too long to flower is it super

564
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:33,120
potent does it taste right if you're a

565
00:18:30,558 --> 00:18:34,639
commercial grower does it sell because

566
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:37,199
if you're putting all of this money into

567
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:39,679
the grow it's got to come back right so

568
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:42,000
does it sell when it sells does it get

569
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:44,080
you top dollar or do your clientele pass

570
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,400
on it if they pass on it why are you

571
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:48,159
growing that [ __ ] grow more of the lemon

572
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,840
jeffrey because the people are gonna buy

573
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,160
that grow the machine grow the soccer

574
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:54,399
souffle that's what they're gonna buy if

575
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,558
they're not buying it switch it up so

576
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:59,759
every plant in your grow space should

577
00:18:56,558 --> 00:19:02,639
have a solid purpose and a strategy and

578
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:04,160
a schedule not just uh it should not

579
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,240
just be a potent plant that pays the

580
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,080
bills but it should also have a schedule

581
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,000
it got cut this day it goes into veg

582
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:11,678
this day it goes into flower this day i

583
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,599
plan to cut it down this day and then i

584
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:16,000
intend to have it dried cured and sold

585
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:17,918
or smoked or processed or whatever by

586
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,480
this time frame have a schedule for

587
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:22,400
every single plant in the grow or that

588
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,798
plant is kind of wasting space and

589
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:28,080
messing up your schedule and messing up

590
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:29,679
your income and your cost effectiveness

591
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:31,678
now since we're talking about individual

592
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:34,640
plants in the grow i did mention mother

593
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:37,440
plants are mother plants necessary for

594
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:40,160
your style of grow think about this a

595
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:42,320
mother plant is kept to preserve the

596
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,759
genetics so that when i want uh let's

597
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:45,839
just pick a plant when i want golden

598
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:48,079
goat i can go to my go to my golden goat

599
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:49,759
plant pull off six clones now i've got

600
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:51,599
six clones of golden goat whenever i

601
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:53,839
want them and that mommy plant is always

602
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:56,159
chilling there she grows every six or

603
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:57,918
eight months or so i gotta cut her down

604
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,200
take one of those best clones and re-mom

605
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,720
that clone and make a new one because

606
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,240
the plant just gets old and big and

607
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,720
spindly and out of control just try to

608
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,480
give it a fresh cut start over but for

609
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:09,120
the most part that golden goat mommy is

610
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:11,038
there as a bank as preservation

611
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:13,519
what is stopping me from just using that

612
00:20:11,038 --> 00:20:16,000
golden goat veg plant and right before i

613
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:19,200
put it into flour take a few clones and

614
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,200
use those clones as my next veg run move

615
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,200
that plant right into the flower space

616
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,960
if you are not a breeder if you are not

617
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,880
completely dependent on keeping those

618
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,519
strains around that is a very viable

619
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,520
option that will free up numbers for you

620
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:34,079
so you could just take a plant that is

621
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:36,639
your lemon jeffree plant take six clones

622
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:38,240
of it put the big plant into the flower

623
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,759
room and you got six clones growing up

624
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,679
for your next run they're already right

625
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:43,038
there maybe wait until your clone's root

626
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:45,679
before you put that plant into flowers

627
00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:48,000
so you have some security but it is not

628
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:50,480
completely necessary to keep a mother

629
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,240
plant around if you are skilled at

630
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,400
taking clones if you understand how to

631
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,919
keep veg plants healthy and happy and if

632
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,600
you can get the clones to root in a

633
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:59,919
timely manner before you put the other

634
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:02,000
plant into flower so keeping clones is

635
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:04,400
not always necessary and that could save

636
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,839
you a lot of space i don't recommend

637
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,919
that for a commercial environment

638
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:09,439
because you may need a lot of clones you

639
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:11,919
need some dedicated plants to give you

640
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:14,480
cuts from but in a home grow space that

641
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:16,080
would save you a lot of plants now let's

642
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,038
get back to talking about mom plants a

643
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:18,798
little bit

644
00:21:17,038 --> 00:21:20,640
why do you have so many mom plants do

645
00:21:18,798 --> 00:21:22,480
you need them or why do you have so many

646
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:25,120
strains do you need them are they

647
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,159
necessary um do you need that many are

648
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:27,839
you just keeping them for hoarder

649
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:30,000
purposes i think i said most of this

650
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:31,759
already but really think about why

651
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,839
you're keeping each plant and then

652
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:35,679
possibly minimize if you don't need all

653
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:37,439
of those if you've got two that are

654
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:39,600
depend it depends on what your goal is

655
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,840
it's all about the goal but if you are a

656
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:43,199
commercial cropper find the one or two

657
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:44,720
that sell the best that way you don't

658
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,120
have to keep clones or moms you could

659
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:49,360
just keep production going uh if you're

660
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:50,879
a medical grower find the one or two the

661
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:52,399
one for the day the one for the night

662
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,760
and then one to switch it up because you

663
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,038
always need that switch hitter i feel

664
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:57,599
like you get strain lock if you smoke

665
00:21:55,038 --> 00:21:59,119
the [ __ ] the same [ __ ] too long but try

666
00:21:57,599 --> 00:22:00,719
to pick two or three maybe four and

667
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:03,038
minimize down and make sure that every

668
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,720
strain in that garden has a solid reason

669
00:22:03,038 --> 00:22:06,319
for being there if you fill the grow

670
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,159
with a bunch of sixes how are you gonna

671
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:09,359
get a bunch of nines in there and if you

672
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:11,440
got a bunch of nines and you got them

673
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:13,439
surrounded by six is it just d values

674
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:15,600
the nines let's get the nines in there

675
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,519
maybe some tens maybe some elevens if

676
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:19,279
you quit [ __ ] with the sixes all

677
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:21,038
right another great way to save a few

678
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:23,759
bucks or increase productivity in a

679
00:22:21,038 --> 00:22:25,679
small space is to add some shelves for

680
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:27,919
vertical growing if you've got clones on

681
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:29,919
a shelf what's to stop you from putting

682
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:31,600
like a three or four tier shelf with the

683
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:33,120
t5 light with the tray of clones with

684
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:35,119
the t5 light with the tray of clones

685
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:37,199
with the t5 light and a tray of clones

686
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:38,719
or just a one shelf area and you could

687
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,038
put small plants on the bottom big

688
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,640
plants on the top hang your light from

689
00:22:41,038 --> 00:22:44,640
the underside so you got a light for the

690
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,080
small plants then put your big light up

691
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,640
on the ceiling and put your plants up on

692
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:50,319
the top shelf use that vertical space to

693
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,080
the best of your ability we have a

694
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:54,319
friend that's been on the podcast before

695
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:56,000
that does a complete vertical grow so

696
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:58,158
there are a lot of options to go up if

697
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,759
you run out of space on the floor use

698
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:01,120
that vertical space

699
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:02,640
then you can make space for all of your

700
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:04,479
gear and all of your stuff get that up

701
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,400
off the floor then you've got more floor

702
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,798
space for working more floor space for

703
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,720
plants also i see a lot of walkways and

704
00:23:08,798 --> 00:23:12,240
grows in a small grow and a personal

705
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,319
grow what do you need a walkway for we

706
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,798
talked about this on a previous episode

707
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:18,960
that is not a walking path that's not

708
00:23:16,798 --> 00:23:20,400
your zen garden that is not where you go

709
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,679
to put your hands behind your back and

710
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,679
walk around like old man and feed the

711
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:25,840
ducks think about life that is a

712
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:27,519
productivity space put plants in the

713
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:28,720
[ __ ] walkway i understand a

714
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:30,879
commercial grill you've got to get

715
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,960
through there if it's your personal grow

716
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,720
move plants into that space you can fit

717
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,079
another row of plants put them in there

718
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,440
you're ripping yourself off we're not

719
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:39,918
growing concrete we're not growing

720
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,600
drywall rock growing floor we want to

721
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:43,840
grow more plants put more plants in that

722
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:46,240
space that is my theory back to filling

723
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:48,079
up the cabinet or the box or the cooler

724
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,919
fill it up quit wasting space with the

725
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:51,599
walkway you can just do some work move

726
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:53,759
the plants and walk through do the jenga

727
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:54,798
move do the tetris move do whatever you

728
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:56,240
have to do to get through there but

729
00:23:54,798 --> 00:23:58,480
let's not waste so much space with

730
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:00,240
walkways um

731
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,319
where am i i feel like i got a lot going

732
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,079
on shelves for vertical space

733
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:05,519
how many moms do you have cut and go do

734
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:07,759
you have a strategy do you have a

735
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:10,240
strategy for every plant when i cut a

736
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:12,640
clone i know i think i mentioned this

737
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,558
briefly i know when i cut a clone i know

738
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:17,200
where it's going to go and i know which

739
00:24:14,558 --> 00:24:18,639
space it will go in the veg area i know

740
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,400
which space it's gonna go into the

741
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,320
flower area i know basically what day

742
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,240
it'll go into the flower area do you

743
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:26,319
have a plan and a strategy for every

744
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,240
single plant i see some people that just

745
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:29,918
cut a bunch of clones they pot all of

746
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,400
them and then when it comes time to go

747
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:34,240
into flower they've got 20 or 30 clones

748
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,720
and they pick the best 10 or 12. what

749
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:38,400
are you doing yeah yeah that many plants

750
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:41,038
extra running for that long that you

751
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,000
wasted water soil space newt's time and

752
00:24:41,038 --> 00:24:44,079
energy

753
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,519
get rid of that [ __ ] every plant you cut

754
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:47,119
should be top shelf give it the best

755
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:48,639
love you can pay the best attention you

756
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:50,239
can to it and that way you don't have to

757
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,480
cut a bunch of extras and waste all the

758
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:55,278
time and space have a goal for every

759
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:57,120
single plant that you cut everything

760
00:24:55,278 --> 00:24:59,119
costs something everything in the grow

761
00:24:57,119 --> 00:25:01,918
costs something let's start with just

762
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:04,079
cutting clones you had to use uh clone

763
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:06,000
gel you had to use clone plugs a clone

764
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:08,720
dome you had to clean the equipment

765
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,278
which took you time and energy uh then

766
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,880
you had to use water and nutrients

767
00:25:11,278 --> 00:25:14,720
that's just for cutting clones we're

768
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,159
already at a substantial cost you had to

769
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,159
go to the store and drop some money

770
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:19,760
already then you've got to pop those

771
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:22,159
clones into something you've got to buy

772
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:23,278
either soil cocoa something to put them

773
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:25,278
in then you've got to have a container

774
00:25:23,278 --> 00:25:26,960
to put that [ __ ] in then probably some

775
00:25:25,278 --> 00:25:29,119
plant tags or something then we got to

776
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:31,360
feed them we gotta give them water that

777
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:33,278
is material we've gotta pay for and more

778
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:35,519
time that we are investing everything

779
00:25:33,278 --> 00:25:37,359
costs something uh big pots cost

780
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:39,119
something soil and cocoa again cost

781
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:42,000
something the ph up and down costs

782
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:43,519
something the ph pen costs a lot those

783
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,159
things are expensive and they die you

784
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:48,480
break them quite often everything costs

785
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:49,840
cost a lot if you've got a ph pen make

786
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,440
sure you keep the cap on it make sure

787
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:52,480
you keep it clean and calibrated that'll

788
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,080
save you some money because then you

789
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,599
don't have to buy a new one take good

790
00:25:54,079 --> 00:25:57,599
care of your equipment

791
00:25:55,599 --> 00:25:59,519
the lights all cost money the water

792
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:00,959
costs a lot of money but something you

793
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:03,038
might not be thinking about something

794
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:05,278
you may not have considered what is your

795
00:26:03,038 --> 00:26:07,278
time worth what is your energy in that

796
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:09,119
grow worth if you're a single person

797
00:26:07,278 --> 00:26:10,640
like myself i'm just a single dude i do

798
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:12,719
have a daughter she's 18. she wants to

799
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,480
hang out sometimes nowadays but

800
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,480
i'm a single dude so i can dedicate a

801
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,000
lot of time to my garden but if you've

802
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,000
got a family if you've got a lot of [ __ ]

803
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,359
going on people want your attention your

804
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,038
girlfriend's trying to go to the movie

805
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:24,959
your kids need attention your dog wants

806
00:26:23,038 --> 00:26:26,879
to play the other part of life your

807
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,159
friends on the xbox live or playstation

808
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,919
live want to hang out and blow up

809
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:32,400
zombies and [ __ ] you got other [ __ ] to

810
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:34,000
do so your time is very valuable what is

811
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,400
it worth to you how much time are you

812
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,319
spending in there when it comes to

813
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,759
recouping the cost of your grow however

814
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:41,839
you're doing that

815
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:43,359
are you considering your time are you

816
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:45,519
getting paid for the hours that you're

817
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:47,038
spending in there and then think about

818
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:48,558
maybe you'll do [ __ ] more quickly if

819
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:50,960
you're thinking like oh i'm in here this

820
00:26:48,558 --> 00:26:52,399
much a day because time is money no

821
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:55,120
matter what you're doing no matter where

822
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:56,480
you are unfortunately now time is money

823
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:58,719
you could be at work you could be doing

824
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,960
something else making some money doing

825
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,159
another task fulfilling a side job so

826
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,480
let's get this stuff done and think

827
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:06,880
about how many hours we're spending in

828
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,240
that grow all right now let's talk about

829
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,320
a couple of other things that i think

830
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:13,278
can definitely help us out if we use

831
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:15,119
strategy when purchasing what is your

832
00:27:13,278 --> 00:27:17,519
pesticide regimen what is your

833
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:19,519
integrated pest management plan strategy

834
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:21,519
goal schedule are you going to buy

835
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:23,440
pesticides are you going to buy predator

836
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:25,839
bugs let's think about this before we

837
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:28,480
get too far into any grow because this

838
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:30,720
is going to be a cost quality pesticides

839
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,720
are not cheap but if you don't use

840
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,720
something bugs will get to your garden

841
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,240
and that is even more expensive

842
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,798
preventative measures are more

843
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,240
affordable and more effective than

844
00:27:38,798 --> 00:27:41,359
trying to fix a problem because then

845
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,038
you're gonna have to go nuclear you're

846
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:45,038
gonna have to find specific [ __ ] based

847
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:46,960
on what stage you're in i think if you

848
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:49,519
plan ahead start having a pesticide

849
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,120
regimen early it is more cost effective

850
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:52,879
are you going to use spray pesticides

851
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:54,798
are you going to use bugs what is your

852
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,559
strategy let's think about it now

853
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:57,918
because if we plan for this ahead fit it

854
00:27:56,558 --> 00:28:00,879
in the budget when we build the grow

855
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:02,720
that'll help us out then let's not use

856
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,480
too much pesticide i see a lot of people

857
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,079
when they mix it up they go mix up a

858
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,519
five or i work in a commercial grow so

859
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:09,119
it's a five gallon thing of [ __ ] or a

860
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:10,960
one gallon thing of pesticides most of

861
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:12,879
the time and then i see them dump some

862
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:15,038
of that let's remember and learn how

863
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:17,360
much we're gonna use per spray let's try

864
00:28:15,038 --> 00:28:19,599
to anticipate it um you don't always

865
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:21,359
have to mix up the whole entire [ __ ]

866
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:23,839
sprayer worth you can just mix up enough

867
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:26,398
to cover the plants so this time maybe

868
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:27,918
just do a water spray put [ __ ] half a

869
00:28:26,398 --> 00:28:29,839
gallon of water in your sprayer and see

870
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:31,038
if that covers the room and if it does

871
00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:32,798
you only need a half a gallon of

872
00:28:31,038 --> 00:28:34,879
pesticide if it doesn't maybe you need a

873
00:28:32,798 --> 00:28:36,240
full gallon give it a dry or just a wet

874
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,679
run it's gonna say a dry run but you

875
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,679
know give it a wet run and see how much

876
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:40,720
you need to wet the room then go back

877
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:43,038
the next time and hit it with the

878
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:45,038
pesticide let's not waste the pesticide

879
00:28:43,038 --> 00:28:46,720
then think about how much time you're

880
00:28:45,038 --> 00:28:48,640
spending applying those pesticides i

881
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,798
always talk about it the cost versus

882
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,399
releasing the predators versus applying

883
00:28:50,798 --> 00:28:53,679
the pesticide which is more cost

884
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:55,678
effective because you do need the

885
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:57,519
personal protective equipment you got a

886
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:59,759
suit up there's a reentry interval with

887
00:28:57,519 --> 00:29:01,359
the pesticides sometimes the predators

888
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:03,038
are more cost effective but you do need

889
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:04,798
to have a crew to go put them out on the

890
00:29:03,038 --> 00:29:07,038
plants so think of which one is going to

891
00:29:04,798 --> 00:29:08,319
be more cost effective for you

892
00:29:07,038 --> 00:29:10,558
then when it comes to applying the

893
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:12,798
pesticides when it comes to just about

894
00:29:10,558 --> 00:29:15,038
anything in the grow get the appropriate

895
00:29:12,798 --> 00:29:16,720
equipment if you get some cheap sprayers

896
00:29:15,038 --> 00:29:18,798
some cheap [ __ ] it's gonna break after

897
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,240
the second or third maybe sometimes the

898
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:22,158
first use

899
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,599
they always say the most expensive

900
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:24,960
hammer is the cheap hammer because

901
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:27,119
you're gonna break it you gotta buy a

902
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,880
hammer every [ __ ] week every month

903
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:32,239
get a good hammer you only gotta buy it

904
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:33,840
once then they say uh pay once cry once

905
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:36,000
some [ __ ] like that i don't remember all

906
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:37,918
the funny [ __ ] that old people say but

907
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,440
uh buy quality [ __ ]

908
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:42,240
you're gonna have a better experience

909
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:44,798
with good equipment if your grow room

910
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:47,200
equipment is frustrating to use you

911
00:29:44,798 --> 00:29:49,278
can't have a relia an enjoyable uh

912
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,640
relaxing time in that grow part of the

913
00:29:49,278 --> 00:29:52,079
point of going in there is enjoying

914
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,159
yourself and having a good time and

915
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:55,839
relaxing i always say it's a work area

916
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:57,278
but it should feel good to be in there

917
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:59,278
and if it's frustrating if your gear

918
00:29:57,278 --> 00:30:01,200
doesn't work if you're measuring

919
00:29:59,278 --> 00:30:02,880
equipment your ph equipment doesn't work

920
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,038
it's going to frustrate you get good

921
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,799
[ __ ] so you can enjoy yourself and then

922
00:30:05,038 --> 00:30:08,480
cheap [ __ ] breaks it is going to break

923
00:30:06,798 --> 00:30:11,038
you're gonna have to buy it again

924
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,558
replacing a dehumidifier or repairing a

925
00:30:11,038 --> 00:30:14,798
broken air conditioner in the middle of

926
00:30:12,558 --> 00:30:16,480
a grow is a struggle the grove is

927
00:30:14,798 --> 00:30:18,319
running the plants are relying on that

928
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,919
we can't turn off the lights and you've

929
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:21,918
already purchased the air conditioner

930
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:23,679
one time spent the time to install it

931
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:25,278
why didn't you get a good one then we

932
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:27,200
didn't have to replace that [ __ ] in the

933
00:30:25,278 --> 00:30:28,798
middle of the grow and move the plants

934
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,000
around and struggle and get in there

935
00:30:28,798 --> 00:30:32,319
with the ladder while the lights are

936
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,798
running it was so much easier if we

937
00:30:32,319 --> 00:30:36,798
spent the money early on and didn't [ __ ]

938
00:30:34,798 --> 00:30:38,720
around i think one of my last pieces of

939
00:30:36,798 --> 00:30:41,440
advice on saving you money in the grow

940
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:43,759
room is to invest in industrial

941
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:46,080
equipment not cheap walmart [ __ ] not

942
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:48,319
cheap target [ __ ] skip the stores the

943
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:50,319
box stores and get industrial equipment

944
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:52,158
we are building a grow space an

945
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:54,240
agricultural workspace whether it's your

946
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:56,320
home grow especially your commercial

947
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:58,079
grow don't go get the cheap [ __ ] get

948
00:30:56,319 --> 00:31:01,038
industrial stuff designed for

949
00:30:58,079 --> 00:31:03,599
greenhouses for commercial horticultural

950
00:31:01,038 --> 00:31:05,440
production or it will break if you try

951
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:07,038
to stick just a basic piece of gear that

952
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:09,278
was made for your bedroom or for your

953
00:31:07,038 --> 00:31:10,398
office a dehumidifier for the office if

954
00:31:09,278 --> 00:31:11,839
you try to put that in the grill it's

955
00:31:10,398 --> 00:31:14,000
not going to keep up it's going to get

956
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:15,359
funky and gunky on the inside it's going

957
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,880
to get dirty it's not going to keep up

958
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:19,759
and it's going to die buy something

959
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:21,360
quality get the good [ __ ] we're building

960
00:31:19,759 --> 00:31:22,879
we're building a workspace we're not

961
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:25,199
building an office we're not building

962
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:27,120
just a little it might sound like cutesy

963
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:29,519
little grow i think of it more as it's a

964
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:31,359
functioning industrial space so get

965
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:32,640
industrial [ __ ] that's gonna work and

966
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:34,879
gonna last

967
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,080
the good [ __ ] works so much better and

968
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,679
then people you're not gonna have as

969
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:38,798
many problems people always complain

970
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:40,559
when they buy the cheap [ __ ] they're

971
00:31:38,798 --> 00:31:42,158
like well i spent the money and my

972
00:31:40,558 --> 00:31:43,599
problems still exist it's because you

973
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:45,360
didn't spend enough and i know i'm

974
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:47,678
trying to tell you how to save money but

975
00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:49,918
you'll save money by spending money up

976
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:51,440
front that may sound crazy but you'll

977
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:53,200
see how it works if you're one of those

978
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:55,120
people that keeps buying the cheap [ __ ]

979
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,399
buy the good one how many times you're

980
00:31:55,119 --> 00:31:58,558
going to deal with fixing [ __ ] just buy

981
00:31:56,398 --> 00:32:00,319
the expensive one the first time

982
00:31:58,558 --> 00:32:02,000
if you can afford it buy the best you

983
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:03,119
can buy the first time

984
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,278
uh when it comes to buying air

985
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:07,918
conditioners uh for a commercial grow i

986
00:32:05,278 --> 00:32:09,759
always say uh don't get one giant unit

987
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:11,840
get several smaller units that way when

988
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:13,440
that big one uh when one of them breaks

989
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:15,519
you've got a couple of backups you can

990
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:17,038
limp along and keep it growing i've been

991
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:18,798
in commercial grows where the giant air

992
00:32:17,038 --> 00:32:20,558
conditioner broke and then it's been 110

993
00:32:18,798 --> 00:32:22,319
in the whole grow got to turn off half

994
00:32:20,558 --> 00:32:24,639
the lights and try to make that happen

995
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:26,480
if we had just three small acs something

996
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:28,480
