34
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,040
you know i like to start this podcast

35
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:21,280
off by talking about what i'm smoking

36
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,600
today i've been taking dabs of angel's

37
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,439
breath live batter from green dot labs

38
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:27,599
this is a blend of halo and purple

39
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:28,319
starburst on the package the flavor is

40
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:30,719
described as

41
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:32,158
gas floral and apple i think i

42
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:33,840
completely agree with that

43
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,359
when i crack open the jar i'm greeted

44
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,719
with that gassy aroma

45
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:38,478
when i take a dab that is when the

46
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:40,798
sweetness of the floral kicks in

47
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:41,759
then after i exhale that is when a sour

48
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,680
apple flavor

49
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,118
just lingers on my tongue and i

50
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,960
completely enjoy it

51
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:48,478
one thing i should mention is that this

52
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:51,039
concentrate kicked

53
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:52,078
my ass i took a couple of fat dabs and

54
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,960
now i'm sitting here

55
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:56,798
in mellow mode i'm super chilled out

56
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:58,239
this has got me nice and relaxed

57
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,960
on the back of the package it says it

58
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:03,280

108
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:27,199
too off track

109
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:28,719
let's jump right into the first email

110
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:30,560
for today's episode

111
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:32,318
this one comes from our friend they

112
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,158
signed it one love from zombie

113
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:36,079
this one comes from our friend zombie

114
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:38,878
this is a great question it goes

115
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,959
like this hey bro i had a quick question

116
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:42,719
about splitting a grow space

117
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,280
i have a room that is approximately

118
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:46,080
seven feet wide by seven feet deep and

119
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,759
10-ish

120
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,120
feet tall all right i've got a good

121
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:51,598
visual of that in my head

122
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,158
i currently have a 5x5 grow tent in the

123
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:55,199
room

124
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:56,639
and the wasted space is driving me nuts

125
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:59,119
uh yeah you've got a big room there

126
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:00,559
you're wasting uh at least two feet by

127
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,080
two feet each direction

128
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,840
there's a lot of wasted space you could

129
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,920
be doing a lot more productivity

130
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,598
a lot more production in there a lot

131
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:09,438
more plants is what i'm trying to say

132
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:11,199
that would drive me nuts as well let's

133
00:04:09,438 --> 00:04:13,039
keep going the message says after much

134
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:14,000
brainstorming i think the best solution

135
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:16,319
is going to be building

136
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,759
a wall between the flower space at three

137
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:20,719
and a half by seven feet

138
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,600
and a veg mother space at three by seven

139
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,560
feet

140
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,000
um okay i think there's an extra foot

141
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,720
somewhere there but that mats out i

142
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,639
think

143
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,759
feel free to add your thoughts and input

144
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,160
on that

145
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,800
um my thoughts so far is that that

146
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,639
doesn't matter

147
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,319
there's a half a foot somewhere missing

148
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,918
but uh you're close enough then it's

149
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:40,560
gonna go on to say

150
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:42,079
my question however is about accessing

151
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,918
the flowering space

152
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:45,758
there's only one door to the room and

153
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:46,478
i'm thinking it should open into the veg

154
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,040
space

155
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:49,599
since so there is no risk of a light

156
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,840
leak

157
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,120
from my main area causing trouble i get

158
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:55,039
what you're asking and yes that does

159
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,040
make great sense i will elaborate

160
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,199
our friend has a big room he wants to

161
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,879
divide the room into two spaces

162
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,560
he's thinking about building a wall

163
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:04,319
almost right down the center maybe leave

164
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,839
one side maybe leave that flower space a

165
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:06,800
little bit bigger the veg and mom's side

166
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:08,478
a little smaller

167
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,560
but build a wall right down the middle

168
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:12,079
now we've got two rooms he's wondering

169
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,800
if he should access the room through

170
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:16,800
that veg space yes absolutely

171
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,560
the veg space we can interrupt that

172
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,240
light cycle the veg will be on more

173
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,240
often than the flowering cycle

174
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,240
we're gonna run an 18-6 cycle perhaps a

175
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,400
24-hour on cycle in there

176
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,680
let's walk into the grow through the veg

177
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:29,120
space i'm gonna keep going because there

178
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,959
is more to this it says

179
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,160
so my issue is that i have a standard

180
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:34,399
door in the room

181
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,840
i have to keep so much space clear to

182
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:37,519
physically open the door

183
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:40,000
i'm wondering if you've seen anything in

184
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:41,519
your experience consulting low-key grows

185
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,439
that would be a good substitute for a

186
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:45,758
standard door that i could maintain

187
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:47,439
usable space in the veg and mother

188
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,038
area so i had a couple of great

189
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:50,319
suggestions and ideas for my friend

190
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:52,719
zombie here

191
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:53,918
i said that my first recommendation

192
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,080
would be to build

193
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:58,000
a just frame out a door a wall in the

194
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:59,279
room make it just a crappy frame it

195
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,279
won't take a lot of work just

196
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:03,599
some two by fours build a frame frame

197
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:05,758
out a wall staple some poly to that wall

198
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,280
now you've got a brand new wall if you

199
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,160
don't have a lot of tools if you can't

200
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:09,839
build a frame

201
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,600
you can staple it to the ceiling you can

202
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:13,519
staple it to the walls and let it hang

203
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,439
put a 2x4 down on the floor and wrap it

204
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:16,799
around the 2x4 that'll give it some

205
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:18,560
structure at the bottom give it some

206
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,000
support some stability you've got it

207
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,519
stapled to the walls to the ceiling

208
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,519
you've got it held to the floor that

209
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:23,918
should keep it in place depending on how

210
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:26,318
big

211
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:27,279
this piece of panda film is or poly or

212
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,000
whatever you're going to use i'd

213
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:29,359
recommend

214
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,639
i think paulie and panda film are just

215
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,600
the same thing just different words for

216
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,759
the same [ __ ]

217
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,759
i get some thick panda film staple it up

218
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:38,080
to the ceiling staple it to the walls

219
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,840
before you staple it fold it to make a

220
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:41,038
little fold-over you're doubling up the

221
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:42,799
thickness of material

222
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:44,318
then put a piece of duct tape over it

223
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,720
then put the staples through the duct

224
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,319
tape

225
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,919
now you've got three pieces of material

226
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,960
you are duct taping through the ceiling

227
00:06:47,918 --> 00:06:50,719
or to the ceiling

228
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:52,399
so when that weight of that poly starts

229
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,800
pulling down it doesn't tear

230
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:56,318
the poly right away it'll give you duct

231
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,879
tape and two pieces of poly worth of

232
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,280
stretching

233
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:00,079
before it starts to tear so make a

234
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:03,038
division

235
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:05,038
make a wall make a poly wall then at

236
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:07,199
most grow stores you will find

237
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:09,439
one of my favorite inventions it is a

238
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,720
zipper it comes rolled up it's a long

239
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:12,319
rolled up zipper

240
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,000
you take that zipper and you think about

241
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,520
where you want your door to be

242
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,120
you unroll the zipper and it's got a

243
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:18,399
sticker on the back of it you take it

244
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,439
off just like you're putting on a big

245
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:20,959
bumper sticker

246
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,319
and you start from the floor and you go

247
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:23,519
up or you can start at the top and go

248
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,280
down but it's easier to start at the

249
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:27,680
floor and go up in my opinion

250
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:29,519
put that zipper right at the floor and

251
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,439
unroll it and work your way up

252
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:32,719
now you unzip the zipper and take a

253
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:34,478
blade and cut

254
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,759
right between those two pieces and now

255
00:07:34,478 --> 00:07:37,359
when you're ready to close it your

256
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,240
zipper slides up and down and you've got

257
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,560
a zippered

258
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,319
door so we've made a poly wall we built

259
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,598
a just a minimal frame

260
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,919
you don't need a lot of framing just

261
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:47,680
enough to keep the panda film supported

262
00:07:45,918 --> 00:07:49,598
build the wall then buy the zipper

263
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,280
hydrafarm or other companies make this

264
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:52,878
zipper it just sticks right on

265
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:54,959
i can't explain it any better than that

266
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,720
it's a zipper they come zipped up

267
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:58,000
it's got sticky on it you stick it on

268
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,759
just like a sticker you

269
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,759
unzip it and then you cut right up the

270
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:04,080
middle where you zip and now you've made

271
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,520
a separation and you can zip that closed

272
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:06,560
i hope that makes sense i'm explaining

273
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:08,399
it the best i can

274
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,759
it looks good in my mind can't you see

275
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:10,318
in my mind to see what i'm trying to

276
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,680
show you

277
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,960
all right jump in there for a minute get

278
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,720
a free visual then jump out because

279
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:16,719
there's [ __ ] you do not want to see

280
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,319
let's keep moving uh we've built a poly

281
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,879
wall we put a little bit of a zipper on

282
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,960
there

283
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,400
now you can enter that flowering room

284
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:23,680
through the veg space of course you want

285
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:24,799
to go into the flowering room make that

286
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,720
the back part

287
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,240
don't go in there when the veg is on and

288
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,440
the flowering room is off make sure the

289
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,038
flowering room is on

290
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:33,278
time that right but you should never

291
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:34,000
have to enter the veg through the flower

292
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:35,599
that's one

293
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,038
thing you should always follow now let's

294
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,879
address this door

295
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:40,158
question you did ask how can i make some

296
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:41,918
space for the door

297
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:43,759
that is a very good question here's a

298
00:08:41,918 --> 00:08:45,759
very good suggestion

299
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:46,958
i learned this from a uh i don't

300
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:48,319
remember where i learned this

301
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:50,479
here's a really good suggestion i may

302
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,760
edit that i may not here's a suggestion

303
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,680
for your door space

304
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:55,200
one thing i have seen is most of the

305
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:56,879
time doors swing open

306
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,720
one thing i've seen people do is make a

307
00:08:56,879 --> 00:08:59,120
sliding door if the door just slides

308
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,800
over

309
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,560
if it just moves to the side and doesn't

310
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:03,679
swing you don't get that whole swinging

311
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:05,439
space wasted

312
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:07,199
however much square footage that is of

313
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,000
the door the door is probably two three

314
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,160
feet long

315
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,839
you gotta have that big swinging space

316
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:12,799
that's a lot of space wasted you could

317
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,040
probably put

318
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:16,479
two three maybe four seven gallon pots

319
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:17,039
in the space that it takes to swing a

320
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,879
door

321
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:21,519
so i understand that that is valuable

322
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:23,200
real estate make a sliding door

323
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,639
the door doesn't have to swing if you

324
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,160
can put a sliding door there

325
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:28,159
if you could take the door off and just

326
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:29,519
pop it off and on in and out every day

327
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:30,719
that would be cool i understand this

328
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,679
could be your home i don't know where

329
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,160
you're doing this

330
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:35,519
but a sliding door would save you a lot

331
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:36,879
of space i'm sure the house doesn't have

332
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,639
a sliding door that room probably

333
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:40,159
doesn't have a sliding door now

334
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:41,519
but in a lot of places where the homes

335
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:42,159
are smaller they don't have a lot of

336
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,278
space

337
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:47,919
you will see that a sliding door is more

338
00:09:45,278 --> 00:09:49,278
effective more efficient more economical

339
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:50,479
might be the word i'm looking for but

340
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:53,439
anyway sliding door

341
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,360
would help you out so um i would say

342
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:58,399
instead of dividing it by 50 50

343
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:02,560
i would say probably do 60 40 maybe

344
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:05,200
uh 35 7 what is the math there 65

345
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:06,559
35 something like that uh yeah i know

346
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,680
i'm doing math on the fly we'll call it

347
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:09,838
engineer math

348
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:11,838
uh divide a little bit differently then

349
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,680
build that poly wall stick the zipper on

350
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,160
there and then build yourself a sliding

351
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:15,519
door

352
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:16,958
let me make sure i answered all of the

353
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,120
questions in here it looks like i

354
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:21,278
covered you uh yep

355
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,959
and then it says one love from zombie a

356
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:24,000
zombie big love big respect thank you

360
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:30,399

361
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:31,278
zombie with the detailed email gave him

362

366
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:41,359

386
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:14,078
for the pack of seeds i hope they will

387
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:16,399
work well for you i know it says i've

388
00:11:14,078 --> 00:11:18,719
got a question for the show

389
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,639
first i see no difference in seed banks

390
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,959
that they sell cbd genetics and the

391
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:25,919
flowers are loaded with trichomes

392
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:26,399
what exactly is that made out of if it's

393
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:29,759
almost

394
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:31,120
no thc um okay so i think the question

395
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:33,519
you're saying is that you see

396
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,959
seeds advertised on seed banks that are

397
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:38,639
supposed to be high in

398
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:41,199
cbd but they are covered in trichomes

399
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:42,399
those trichomes just don't contain thc

400
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,320
that plant is not

401
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,679
known to produce thc that's not one of

402
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,640
the traits of that plant

403
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:50,159
so that is cbd within that plant that's

404
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:50,958
what they're advertising i haven't grown

405
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:53,278
that seed

406
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:54,479
i can't testify what it's going to do

407
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:56,399
but uh

408
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,959
you're saying what is exactly is that

409
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:01,440
made out of if it's almost no thc

410
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:02,719
inside of those trichomes it is cbd

411
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,800
that's all it is in there

412
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,560
no thc they're lab testing it is not

413
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:08,719
showing the presence of thc

414
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:10,078
so it goes on to say and they are

415
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,639
different density

416
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:13,599
or shape or anything really i think

417
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:17,360
you're asking if

418
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:20,320
cbd buds are any different than thc buds

419
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,200
it is basically the same plant hemp and

420
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,600
cannabis

421
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,440
are basically the same plant in colorado

422
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,159
the main distinction between hemp and

423
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,320
cannabis

424
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:29,679
is a lab test that tells you if that

425
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,240
plant has point

426
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:33,199
three percent thc or higher if it's got

427
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,519
more than that

428
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:38,240
it is now a cannabis plant it is not a

429
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,919
hemp plant that may be 0.3 or 0.03

430
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,600
somebody will correct me i didn't look

431
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:42,719
before i started the show i have a bad

432
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,639
habit of forgetting

433
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,000
that number uh it's not something i need

434
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,079
to pay attention to a lot

435
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,200
but that is basically the distinction

436
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:52,319
between hemp

437
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,920
and cannabis is thc or cbd and a lab

438
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,760
test it is the same plant

439
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:57,120
it's the same thing it's just different

440
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:59,200
traits does one put

441
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,360
does one express thc or does one express

442
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,040
cbd sometimes you get both

443
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,159
and there are also other cannabinoids

444
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:05,919
that we're learning about and

445
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:07,278
discovering they're just not as uh

446
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:08,958
prevalent and popular

447
00:13:07,278 --> 00:13:10,399
at this time you're going to hear about

448
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:12,000
uh cbv

449
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,159
if you haven't already that'll be the

450
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
next one that i predict will be really

451
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:17,919
popular and cbg as well

452
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,759
so it goes on it says i see a lot of

453
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:21,919
websites taking use

454
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:23,120
the same pictures for multiple strains

455
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:24,559
and breeders

456
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,959
i'm not sure what you mean by that the

457
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:29,119
same website website

458
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:30,799
uses the same strain multiple pictures

459
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,320
strains and breeders

460
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:33,679
if the one breeder is on multiple

461
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,120
websites you should use the same pick

462
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:36,958
but i think you might be saying that you

463
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,639
see the same picture pop up on multiple

464
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:40,479
websites that's kind of [ __ ]

465
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,240
that shouldn't be happening i'm not sure

466
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,000
exactly what you mean there

467
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,360
i can't speak too much on that without a

468
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,399
clear idea of what you mean

469
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,919
it says um i see a lot of websites

470
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,440
taking these the same pictures

471
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:53,759
and it says i was the man at playing

472
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,040
memory as a kid i've even seen it in a

473
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:56,639
few grow books

474
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:58,399
so yeah i think there weren't as many

475
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,639
photographers and as many people

476
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,240
taking cannabis photography and doing it

477
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,600
and so people were able to be kind of

478
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,560
sneaky for a little while now the

479
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,959
industry has

480
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:08,399
gotten more transparent a while back

481
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:10,078
everybody was just working in the

482
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,839
shadows nobody knew who the breeders

483
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:13,519
were nobody knew what the growers looked

484
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:14,000
like nobody knew who the photographers

485
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,839
were

486
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,600
so it was easier to kind of do people

487
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:18,880
and not be completely honest and

488
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,560
completely transparent

489
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:22,559
so hopefully those times are passed

490
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:26,078
hopefully you're going to start seeing

491
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:27,679
actual real legit photos of the plants

492
00:14:26,078 --> 00:14:29,359
i know some breeders will put pictures

493
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:31,278
of the mom plants they can get photos

494
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,639
out early and start selling the seeds

495
00:14:31,278 --> 00:14:34,399
i don't like to do that kind of stuff i

496
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,519
don't think that's right i can't speak

497
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,519
for what you saw

498
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,360
but hopefully it doesn't happen anymore

499
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,639
hopefully the industry has changed

500
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,320
with all the transparency with

501
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,959
legalization hopefully that [ __ ] goes

502
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,480
away

503
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:46,479
that says you've also seen it in grow

504
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,159
books i'm sure i'm sure you've seen that

505
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,680
sort of stuff it's gonna happen

506
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:51,679
but uh hopefully it doesn't happen

507
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:52,638
anymore we are getting more integrity in

508
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:53,519
the industry is the word i've been

509
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:54,879
fishing for

510
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,560
uh then there's more to this it says

511
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:59,198
second question is what you

512
00:14:56,559 --> 00:15:00,559
what brought you to be a rastafarian i

513
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:02,639
know very little about it

514
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:04,319
i was raised baptist and i hit a certain

515
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,959
age and i couldn't pretend

516
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,519
anymore to believe it so now i have no

517
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:09,838
faith

518
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:11,440
ah that's okay it says i was curious if

519
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,120
you were brought up with your beliefs or

520
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,199
found them later in life all right let

521
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:18,399
me jump in here before i go too far

522
00:15:15,198 --> 00:15:20,399
what brought me to rastafari um

523
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,600
just like most people i was at a point

524
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,879
in life where i was looking for

525
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,320
something i didn't know i was looking

526
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:26,000
for something but there was a gap in my

527
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,560
life i didn't know what it was

528
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,159
i met a couple of people who were rasta

529
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:31,838
and they taught me a lot of great things

530
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:32,799
i was really drawn to one guy shout out

531
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,399
ross chris

532
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:36,000
you always mean a lot to me bro also big

533
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,240
shout out to ross bradley

534
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,919
those two guys taught me a lot they

535
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,959
influenced and inspired me quite a bit

536
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:42,399
they kind of looked after me they

537
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:42,879
wouldn't let me get too out of line if

538
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,480
my

539
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:46,240
line of thinking was too outlandish

540
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,879
they'd say bro that's not right and

541
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,240
they'd kind of

542
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:53,278
reel me in uh ross chris was seriously

543
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:55,278
still is a heavy practicing rastafarian

544
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:56,879
rasta brad is he's got rasta in his

545
00:15:55,278 --> 00:15:57,278
heart he doesn't follow rasta so much

546
00:15:56,879 --> 00:15:58,720
now

547
00:15:57,278 --> 00:16:01,120
i had to kind of adjust to a different

548
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:03,440
lifestyle but those guys taught me a lot

549
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,480
i think being around them being exposed

550
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,240
to rasta

551
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,000
all the right things just the stars

552
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,480
lined up there's another rasta saying it

553
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,120
says

554
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,600
he who feels it knows it and i know it

555
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,000
so

556
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,040
ah and no i wasn't raised around

557
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,559
rastafari

558
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:18,159
our family celebrated christmas and

559
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:19,758
easter but i don't think we

560
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:21,198
went to church more than five times when

561
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:23,278
i was a kid so

562
00:16:21,198 --> 00:16:24,799
uh they believed in christianity but

563
00:16:23,278 --> 00:16:26,559
they weren't christians if that's

564
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:28,479
like they acted they were walmart

565
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:30,159
christians they were american christians

566
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,759
they were holiday christians that might

567
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:34,240
be the way to put it uh

568
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:36,000
they tried to be celebratory and whatnot

569
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,320
but ah no our family wasn't

570
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,440
really faith or religious based that was

571
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,920
all on my own

572
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,800
i kind of discovered that uh as an as a

573
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:44,479
young adult

574
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:46,078
and kind of just on my own because of

575
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,440
some friends and just being around my

576
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:48,000
friends and having a gap and when i

577
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,600
started

578
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,360
i knew that my life was going well and i

579
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,680
knew that when i acknowledged the good

580
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,440
things in my life i got more good things

581
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,638
and when i started thinking jaw for

582
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,880
those things and listening to the

583
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:01,600
guidance of rastafari those good things

584
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:03,120
started coming in abundance and i still

585
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,558
still follow that every day give thanks

586
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,359
for what i'm given every day

587
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:08,639
and the good gifts keep coming so i must

588
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,838
be doing something right

589
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,600
uh people don't want to hear too much

590
00:17:09,838 --> 00:17:12,558
about religious talk on a podcast they

591
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,438
don't come here for that they come here

592
00:17:12,558 --> 00:17:15,038
for grow knowledge

593
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:17,120
so thank you for the quick opportunity

594
00:17:15,038 --> 00:17:19,038
to talk about rastafari for a moment

595
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,558
a lot of people have asked me i've kind

596
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,919
of avoided the question on the podcast

597
00:17:20,558 --> 00:17:23,678
that's for me that's not for you and a

598
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:26,079
lot of people don't care so

599
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:28,400
uh i became rastafari because ross chris

600
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:29,678
and ross brad were really inspirational

601
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,120
uh because i knew there were a lot of

602
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:33,360
good things going on in my life and a

603
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:35,199
lot of it was pointing to rastafari

604
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:36,558
and uh i don't know it's been there ever

605
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,480
since and it's never going away

606
00:17:36,558 --> 00:17:39,759
so that's where rasta came from i want

607
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,440
to keep going it says i believe your

608
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:42,798
fans are not a bunch of judgmental

609
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,440
pricks and would love to get a little

610
00:17:42,798 --> 00:17:46,079
deeper

611
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,798
into what made rosted jeff i hope that

612
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:48,558
was uh

613
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:50,798
enough and not too much i'm sure some

614

hotmail.com

656
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:09,200
this question goes a lot like this

657
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:10,558
i purchased regular seeds for the first

658
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,960
time and i'm trying to figure out

659
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:15,119
how and when to cull the males i'm

660
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,600
growing in a single 4x4 tent which i use

661
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:18,239
for both

662
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:19,678
veg and flower i prefer the scrog method

663
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,200
for plant training i see where we're

664
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,360
going to run into problems here

665
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,480
however i typically begin scrogging

666
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:26,319
during the mid

667
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,919
veg stage and i'm assuming i won't be

668
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:30,960
able to identify the sex

669
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:32,320
until very late in veg or early flower i

670
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,400
obviously don't want to

671
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:36,798
scrog all of my plants and then try to

672
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,880
untangle and remove a bunch of males

673
00:19:36,798 --> 00:19:40,558
after they've grown into the netting any

674
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,400
advice you can provide on how to best

675
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:43,519
resolve this issue would be greatly

676
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,360
appreciated

677
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:47,200
thanks for the great work you do from

678
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:49,839
casey also known as

679
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,279
justice groves on instagram this is a

680
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:53,199
great question this will get me talking

681
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:55,359
for quite a few minutes

682
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,120
we need to realize that the first run

683
00:19:55,359 --> 00:19:57,759
with the batch of seeds is not the

684
00:19:57,119 --> 00:20:00,558
production

685
00:19:57,759 --> 00:20:01,359
run you were thinking about growing big

686
00:20:00,558 --> 00:20:03,440
ass plants

687
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:05,038
scrogging them out training them

688
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,159
spending a bunch of time on them

689
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:07,679
and you don't even know what you've got

690
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:09,120
you don't know if you've got males you

691
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,320
don't know if you've got hermaphrodites

692
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:11,279
you don't know if you've got [ __ ]

693
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:13,279
phenotypes

694
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:15,200
you don't know what's in there so we

695
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:15,678
need to readjust our approach we need to

696
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,400
do

697
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:20,080
a phenol hunt and a finder run before we

698
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,159
do a big production run

699
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:23,759
you do have a couple of options if you

700
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:25,840
don't want to waste a lot of time

701
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:27,759
if you just want to find the males and

702
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:30,240
cull the males and get them out of there

703
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:30,960
a real easy way to do it is to put the

704
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,679
plants

705
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,000
under 1212 lighting reduce the lights to

706
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:36,080
12

707
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,279
12 give them 12 hours of darkness 12

708
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:40,798
hours of daytime

709
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:42,079
in about 10 to 15 days you will see sex

710
00:20:40,798 --> 00:20:43,279
those plants will show you if they're

711
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:45,439
boys or girls

712
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:47,759
as soon as you have verified the sex of

713
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:51,038
the plants put the timer back on 18

714
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:52,240
6. if these plants only get about 14

715
00:20:51,038 --> 00:20:54,240
days into flower

716
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,279
it will not take much to revert them

717
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,798
back to veg

718
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:58,480
then you can put them under your scrog

719
00:20:56,798 --> 00:20:58,879
screen spread them out the way you need

720
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,200
to

721
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:03,200
you're not going to waste a lot of space

722
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,200
that is a very quick and easy way

723
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,120
to determine sex you can just throw the

724
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,720
plants right under 12 12

725
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:11,038
and they will show you if they're boys

726
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,720
or girls then put them right back into

727
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:14,158
veg take those boys out of there

728
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,079
spread those girls out get them in the

729
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:18,799
scrog net just the way you need to

730
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:20,240
another option is to cut a clone i know

731
00:21:18,798 --> 00:21:21,759
you've only got the one room

732
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,679
if you had two rooms this is what i

733
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:25,679
would do i would cut a clone

734
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:27,759
from each of those plants i would label

735
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:28,640
the plants first plant one plant two

736
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:30,158
plant three

737
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,840
if you want to name them [ __ ] carol

738
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,919
karen and eileen you can do that

739
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:35,279
but label them then take a clone make

740
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:37,520
sure that the clone is labeled

741
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:39,599
appropriately karen carol and eileen one

742
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:42,158
two and three however you want to do it

743
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:42,879
then put those clones under 1212

744
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,960
lighting

745
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:47,120
the clones will root and they will show

746
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,159
you sex within like i said earlier 10 to

747
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:49,918
15 days

748
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:51,440
those clones will start to grow balls or

749
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:52,480
they'll grow pistols and you can tell if

750
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,400
you've got males or

751
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,558
females then you can throw the clones

752
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,798
away go throw the big plants away

753
00:21:56,558 --> 00:22:00,558
spread out those females but since you

754
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:02,639
have only got the one space

755
00:22:00,558 --> 00:22:03,678
i think your best bet is to put the

756
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,919
plants under 12

757
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:07,120
12 lighting let them show you if they're

758
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:10,880
male or female

759
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:12,319
then return them back to 18 and 6 or 24

760
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,360
hours of lighting whichever you prefer

761
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:15,279
whichever you're doing

762
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:17,199
the 24 hours of lighting will re-veg

763
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:18,480
them more quickly but i think the plants

764
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,120
will grow more happily

765
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:23,360
with the 18 6. everybody likes a nap i'd

766
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:25,199
probably kick ass with 24-hour days

767
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:28,000
i've got a lot of energy i last a long

768
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:30,000
time but i will need a nap eventually so

769
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,839
i think 18 6 may be the way to go

770
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,359
so let me read back over the question

771
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:35,439
make sure i didn't skip anything

772
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:37,678
yes we are all at the same point here i

773
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,720
would say put your plants in 12 12 for

774
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:40,960
just a few days

775
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,400
as soon as you see sex put that timer

776
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,798
back on 18-6

777
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,320
put that scrog net up everything will go

778
00:22:44,798 --> 00:22:46,960
just as planned but you've got to keep

779
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:49,119
in mind

780
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,798
that sometimes that first run isn't

781
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:51,439
meant to be a production run i would

782
00:22:50,798 --> 00:22:53,279
rather you

783
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,640
grow them small don't even scrog them

784
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:55,839
out just put them in there

785
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,520
turn them and burn them and see what

786
00:22:55,839 --> 00:22:58,480
you've got now i understand that you

787
00:22:57,519 --> 00:23:00,720
don't have clones

788
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,919
so even if you do have amazing keepers

789
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,240
you can't run it again

790
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:05,360
but in most ideal situations we would

791
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,480
have a clone that we could run

792
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:07,678
over and over again what are you going

793
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,759
to do bro are you going to run these

794
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:11,919
seeds one time and let them go

795
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:13,279
what if you get the most amazing [ __ ]

796
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:14,240
keeper plant out of this and you don't

797
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:15,839
have a clone

798
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,480
we are both going to be heartbroken

799
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:18,000
that's when you're going to have to

800
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,240
learn how to reveg

801
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,599
oh man all right you're going to want it

802
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,279
more tense that's what i'm thinking

803
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:25,918
you're gonna want more tents really

804
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:27,599
really soon so uh justice grows my

805
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:29,360
advice for you is to put those plants

806
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:30,399
under 1212 lighting until they begin to

807
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:32,798
show you sex

808
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,320
as soon as you see sex pull the boys out

809
00:23:32,798 --> 00:23:37,038
put the girls all back in that

810
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:38,558
uh 18 6 lighting throw up the scrog net

811
00:23:37,038 --> 00:23:39,519
grow them into the scrog net as soon as

812
00:23:38,558 --> 00:23:41,599
the net is filled

813
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:43,679
flip them into flower put up another net

814
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:44,639
i'm sure you know what to do from there

815
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:46,480
all right i want to thank you for the
