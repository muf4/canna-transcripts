47
00:02:15,449 --> 00:02:19,560
email I'm going to read in today's

48
00:02:17,009 --> 00:02:21,449
episode is an update in a previous

49
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,670
episode I read an email about a failed

50
00:02:21,449 --> 00:02:25,289
timer I recommended that our friend get

51
00:02:23,669 --> 00:02:27,030
rid of that timer and get his plants

52
00:02:25,289 --> 00:02:29,579
back on the correct schedule as soon as

53
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:31,620
possible he was kind enough to send us

54
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:32,610
an update so let's jump into it it goes

55
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,890
like this

56
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:37,470
what's up Rasta Jeff I wanted to drop

57
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:39,869
you an update on my issue with my tab

58
00:02:37,469 --> 00:02:42,180
timer especially since you answered my

59
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:43,469
question on your podcast well thanks for

60
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:46,319
keeping the touch I do appreciate that

61
00:02:43,469 --> 00:02:48,419
it goes on to say dude I was super

62
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:50,159
stoked when I heard that [ __ ] just

63
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:52,199
because I felt that my problem may have

64
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:54,509
helped another grower or a future grower

65
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:56,729
and that gave me a kick ass feeling so

66
00:02:54,509 --> 00:02:58,889
thank you for that that's a really good

67
00:02:56,729 --> 00:03:00,840
way to look at it your your mistake or

68
00:02:58,889 --> 00:03:02,039
your equipment failure actually led to

69
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,150
you being able to help a few other

70
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:06,269
people so that's a pretty positive

71
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:08,640
attitude he goes on to say I kicked that

72
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:11,069
tab piece of [ __ ] timer out the back

73
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:12,750
door when my new timer came the plants

74
00:03:11,068 --> 00:03:15,149
looked good so far man and I've been

75
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:16,289
checking over them pretty thoroughly and

76
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:18,030
I warned him that he had a light

77
00:03:16,289 --> 00:03:20,099
interruption so I warned him to keep an

78
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:21,419
eye out for hermaphrodites or problems

79
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:23,699
with the plants because that may arise

80
00:03:21,419 --> 00:03:25,379
because of the light interruption he

81
00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:27,389
says so far no problems he's been

82
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:29,310
looking pretty thoroughly he says I may

83
00:03:27,389 --> 00:03:31,919
have lucked out this time the genetics

84
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:33,719
are Femmes from blimburn seeds and they

85
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:36,449
seem pretty reputable they are growing

86
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:39,180
in soil with blue planet farmers pride

87
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:40,619
line and recharge in a tent so it sounds

88
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,090
like you've got good genetics I don't

89
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,139
know who that breeding company is no

90
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:44,879
offense to them I just haven't

91
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:46,380
researched them yet it sounds like

92
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,239
you've got some quality genetics they

93
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:50,009
did not hermaphrodite on you you've got

94
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,930
good nutrients and I'm gonna say that

95
00:03:50,009 --> 00:03:53,849
that recharge in there is what rescued

96
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:56,459
everything so it goes on to say thanks

97
00:03:53,849 --> 00:03:58,590
again for all of your knowledge then the

98
00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:00,629
best part of the email it says PS the

99
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:02,969
wife made me go get that timer from

100
00:04:00,629 --> 00:04:04,769
outside and it is now in the trash that

101
00:04:02,969 --> 00:04:06,180
is really funny because as I read that

102
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:08,900
portion of the message where it says you

103
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:12,629
kicked the timer out the back door I

104
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:13,950
mentally visualized you drop kicking it

105
00:04:12,629 --> 00:04:15,930
throwing it up in the air a couple of

106
00:04:13,949 --> 00:04:17,608
inches booting it across the backyard

107
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:19,228
into oblivion who knows where it went

108
00:04:17,608 --> 00:04:19,798
it's out there somewhere don't give a

109
00:04:19,228 --> 00:04:21,629
[ __ ] anymore

110
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:23,189
it sucks want to forget about it that's

111
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:24,120
really funny I saw that happen but then

112
00:04:23,189 --> 00:04:25,860
I thought about I was like well now

113
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,209
there's a timer in the backyard glad

114
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,979
your wife made you go get it

115
00:04:27,209 --> 00:04:30,719
I'm even more excited that the plants

116
00:04:28,978 --> 00:04:32,699
are not showing you any problems I'm

117
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,259
glad that you did not disrupt the light

118
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:36,090
cycle enough to where those plants firm

119
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:38,220
down on you I'm glad the plants are

120
00:04:36,089 --> 00:04:40,318
going to make it through harvest don't

121
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:43,080
think that you can stop looking for

122
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:44,759
perms they may take a while to show up

123
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:46,978
they may not show up till week eight

124
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:48,870
they may not show up until week nine if

125
00:04:46,978 --> 00:04:50,788
they show up in week eight or week nine

126
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:52,050
you do have a few options you've got a

127
00:04:50,788 --> 00:04:54,418
few things to think about

128
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:56,250
you can simply let them finish if they

129
00:04:54,418 --> 00:04:58,079
do have pollen which is very unlikely

130
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:59,939
they'll probably be sterile they

131
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:02,310
probably won't contain an active pollen

132
00:04:59,939 --> 00:05:04,649
if they do that pollen won't have time

133
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:07,228
to pollinate and make any seeds so not a

134
00:05:04,649 --> 00:05:08,758
big deal if it does firm way late in the

135
00:05:07,228 --> 00:05:10,859
flower cycle but keep an eye on that

136
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:13,620
because that is a good note to take and

137
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:15,660
good info to have on your plants alright

138
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:17,098
I appreciate the great update continue

139
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:18,720
to look at those plants make sure you

140
00:05:17,098 --> 00:05:20,610
don't get any problems in the future and

141
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,889
keep me updated and if you have any

142
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:25,020
questions please reach out I'll be happy

143
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:27,569
to help you out all right let's move on

144
00:05:25,019 --> 00:05:30,180
to the next email this one is very

145
00:05:27,569 --> 00:05:32,490
interesting this email girls just like

146
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:34,259
this hey Rasta Jeff I dig your podcast

147
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:36,360
and I wanted to reach out and ask you a

148
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:38,250
couple of questions you're more than

149
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,658
welcome to use my first name if you

150
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:41,279
think they're good for the podcast

151
00:05:39,658 --> 00:05:44,069
what's up Alex thank you for the great

152
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:45,869
email his question goes like this first

153
00:05:44,069 --> 00:05:48,000
question I just harvested about a dozen

154
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:50,610
plants and they were absolutely bursting

155
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,379
with seeds it really sucked because my

156
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:55,080
yield was super low and I'm sure my

157
00:05:52,379 --> 00:05:57,718
flower still has some seeds buried in it

158
00:05:55,079 --> 00:06:00,060
earlier in the grow I discovered two of

159
00:05:57,718 --> 00:06:02,250
the plants in my tent were male so I got

160
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:04,168
rid of them but I'm guessing I did not

161
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:06,779
discover this in time and they turned

162
00:06:04,168 --> 00:06:09,120
the rest of the females hermaphroditic

163
00:06:06,779 --> 00:06:11,819
um no that's not what happened what

164
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,189
happened was those males pollinated and

165
00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:15,718
they seeded the plants just like they're

166
00:06:14,189 --> 00:06:17,788
supposed to those females were not

167
00:06:15,718 --> 00:06:20,189
hermaphroditic those females never

168
00:06:17,788 --> 00:06:22,228
expressed male signs that's what a

169
00:06:20,189 --> 00:06:25,139
hermaphrodite plant is a female that

170
00:06:22,228 --> 00:06:27,329
shows you male sex traits when it is

171
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:28,740
stressed or maybe at any point in the

172
00:06:27,329 --> 00:06:31,490
flowering cycle that is a hermaphrodite

173
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:34,228
what you have got here is a natural male

174
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:36,689
pollinating natural females that is

175
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:38,038
natural impregnation that is exactly

176
00:06:36,689 --> 00:06:39,689
what is supposed to happen in nature

177
00:06:38,038 --> 00:06:40,310
there was no hermaphroditism

178
00:06:39,689 --> 00:06:42,350
there was

179
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:44,629
no problem everything went according to

180
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:47,030
plan other than you pulling those male

181
00:06:44,629 --> 00:06:49,339
plants out of that room before they were

182
00:06:47,029 --> 00:06:51,379
able to drop pollen so the important

183
00:06:49,339 --> 00:06:53,149
lesson there is next time you've got to

184
00:06:51,379 --> 00:06:54,589
be more diligent you've got to pay more

185
00:06:53,149 --> 00:06:56,839
attention for the males and you have got

186
00:06:54,589 --> 00:06:58,849
to get them out of the room sooner also

187
00:06:56,839 --> 00:07:00,859
another thing to learn your plants did

188
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:02,420
not hermaphrodite and make seeds they

189
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:04,370
were pollinated they were impregnated

190
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:05,750
there is a huge difference there I just

191
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:07,519
want to make sure we're using the right

192
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:09,259
terms so that we understand where we're

193
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:12,019
going in the future so let's talk more

194
00:07:09,259 --> 00:07:14,120
it says more questions is it ever safe

195
00:07:12,019 --> 00:07:16,459
to grow in an enclosed tent with seeds

196
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:20,269
that are not feminized that is

197
00:07:16,459 --> 00:07:23,060
absolutely safe feminized seeds are just

198
00:07:20,269 --> 00:07:25,159
as safe as regular seeds if you are

199
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:26,780
growing in any type of environment there

200
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,100
is no difference if they are bred

201
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:31,219
properly if they are done correctly

202
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:34,970
there is no difference in the potency

203
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:37,220
the vigor the viability nothing will be

204
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:40,010
noticeably different in a feminized seed

205
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:43,280
from a regular seed other than the fact

206
00:07:40,009 --> 00:07:45,259
that it is only a female our friend mr.

207
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:47,149
soll recently posted something to social

208
00:07:45,259 --> 00:07:49,250
media and he put it in a very simple

209
00:07:47,149 --> 00:07:51,139
term that I think is a great way to

210
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:53,569
teach other people I like to give people

211
00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:55,459
credit so mr. soll is where I learned

212
00:07:53,569 --> 00:07:57,709
this this was not my idea big shout out

213
00:07:55,459 --> 00:08:00,229
to Rick big respect to Brothers Grimm

214
00:07:57,709 --> 00:08:03,109
seeds the way that mr. soll put it was

215
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:05,750
when we are making feminized pollen we

216
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:08,689
are basically removing all of the male

217
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:11,449
pollen from the equation imagine if I

218
00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:13,699
took a regular male plant and I was able

219
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:16,069
to shake that plant and I could identify

220
00:08:13,699 --> 00:08:18,949
in the air which pollen was male in

221
00:08:16,069 --> 00:08:20,899
which pollen was female now imagine if I

222
00:08:18,949 --> 00:08:23,209
took a filter it was able to suck out

223
00:08:20,899 --> 00:08:25,459
all of that male pollen now all of the

224
00:08:23,209 --> 00:08:28,159
pollen landing on my plants are female

225
00:08:25,459 --> 00:08:30,859
so I am only putting female pollen on

226
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:33,050
female plants now there are only female

227
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:35,149
chromosomes so I only have the potential

228
00:08:33,049 --> 00:08:37,669
for female offspring that is how a

229
00:08:35,149 --> 00:08:41,480
feminized seed works so feminized seeds

230
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:45,289
and regular seeds are equal if they are

231
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:48,529
made correctly feminized seeds must be

232
00:08:45,289 --> 00:08:51,469
made from solid female starting parent

233
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:54,169
stock if these starting parents have

234
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:56,540
intersex or hermaphroditic traits

235
00:08:54,169 --> 00:08:58,789
that trait may be passed on in that

236
00:08:56,539 --> 00:09:01,519
breeding but if I am working with a

237
00:08:58,789 --> 00:09:04,039
solid female plant it receives pollen

238
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:07,339
that has been reversed properly I will

239
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:10,250
only create female plants all of those

240
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:13,010
offspring will be female so it is

241
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:15,139
absolutely safe to grow in an enclosed

242
00:09:13,009 --> 00:09:17,509
tent with seeds that are or are not

243
00:09:15,139 --> 00:09:19,669
feminized they are basically the same

244
00:09:17,509 --> 00:09:22,189
thing the main difference is you've got

245
00:09:19,669 --> 00:09:24,110
to pull those males out before they drop

246
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:25,490
pollen it is really easy to see a male

247
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:27,289
plant you know what it looks like now

248
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:29,149
you've seen it you've just got to pay

249
00:09:27,289 --> 00:09:30,980
more attention you've got to pull it

250
00:09:29,149 --> 00:09:32,750
sooner if you didn't get it out of there

251
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:34,310
before it pollinated you were not paying

252
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:36,440
close enough attention you've got to

253
00:09:34,309 --> 00:09:37,698
look every single day you should have

254
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:40,550
been in there you should have seen that

255
00:09:37,698 --> 00:09:43,909
that is he growers responsibility so yes

256
00:09:40,549 --> 00:09:46,909
it is absolutely safe to grow feminized

257
00:09:43,909 --> 00:09:48,679
or regular seeds in an enclosed tent and

258
00:09:46,909 --> 00:09:50,120
before I wrap up that section I want to

259
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:52,638
give a big shout out and a big thank you

260
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:54,860
once again to my friend mr. soll from

261
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:56,839
brothers grimm seeds I did borrow the

262
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:59,899
quote about being able to filter out the

263
00:09:56,839 --> 00:10:01,760
male pollen that was his concept that is

264
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:04,220
basically what we are doing when we're

265
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:06,289
making feminized seeds so let's continue

266
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:08,660
there are more sections to this question

267
00:10:06,289 --> 00:10:11,240
is there an easy way to tell if plants

268
00:10:08,659 --> 00:10:12,769
are male earlier on I was checking for

269
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:16,278
the little balls but really couldn't

270
00:10:12,769 --> 00:10:18,589
spot anything amiss the male plants

271
00:10:16,278 --> 00:10:21,320
actually start showing flower much

272
00:10:18,589 --> 00:10:22,790
sooner than the females in my experience

273
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:25,250
most of the time it takes the girls

274
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:27,078
about 10 to 14 days for you can really

275
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:29,778
look at him and go that's a solid female

276
00:10:27,078 --> 00:10:31,278
the boys want to show right away they're

277
00:10:29,778 --> 00:10:33,230
like hey I got a pollinate I got to get

278
00:10:31,278 --> 00:10:34,820
taller than everybody I got to get my

279
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:35,180
balls dropping I got to get my pollen

280
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,769
everywhere

281
00:10:35,179 --> 00:10:38,509
I'm eager I just want to do this they're

282
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:39,799
like a teenage boy just trying to get

283
00:10:38,509 --> 00:10:41,389
out they're just trying to get some

284
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:43,639
attention is trying to bust a nut trying

285
00:10:41,389 --> 00:10:45,740
to spread some seed so the boys will

286
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:48,019
show you a little earlier on you should

287
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:50,120
be able to identify it I do not have a

288
00:10:48,019 --> 00:10:52,220
good way to show you what a male plant

289
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:55,190
looks like through a podcast so it is

290
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:58,069
your responsibility to get a book or use

291
00:10:55,190 --> 00:11:00,199
google and type in male cannabis plant

292
00:10:58,068 --> 00:11:02,299
or female cannabis plant and then click

293
00:11:00,198 --> 00:11:03,409
on the Images tab and look and see the

294
00:11:02,299 --> 00:11:06,889
difference in a male and a female

295
00:11:03,409 --> 00:11:08,029
cannabis plant it should be very easy to

296
00:11:06,889 --> 00:11:10,429
tell the difference

297
00:11:08,029 --> 00:11:13,490
early in Flour if you were paying

298
00:11:10,429 --> 00:11:16,039
attention you will see basically little

299
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:18,500
hairlike looking things coming out those

300
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:20,870
are probably female plants you will see

301
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:23,480
little nubbins little acorn looking

302
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:25,340
things coming out those are balls those

303
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:27,200
are male plants it is really obvious to

304
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:28,970
tell and if you weren't able to find

305
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,129
that I don't think you were looking well

306
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:33,529
enough I don't think you did the the

307
00:11:31,129 --> 00:11:35,750
prerequisite research on growing before

308
00:11:33,529 --> 00:11:37,399
you set up your grow and I don't think

309
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:39,320
you were in there looking frequently

310
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:41,000
enough if you had done some research and

311
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,950
read a book before you set up the grow

312
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,779
which is always my advice read some

313
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:46,879
books before you start growing so you

314
00:11:44,779 --> 00:11:49,250
know what you're getting into then also

315
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:51,169
pay attention to the plants every single

316
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:53,600
day you have to touch every plant in

317
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:55,519
your garden every single day if you want

318
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,509
to be a successful gardener so those are

319
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,579
a couple of things that I would

320
00:11:56,509 --> 00:12:00,649
recommend you brush up on get some books

321
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:03,080
get some google going on look at some

322
00:12:00,649 --> 00:12:05,360
images learn how to visually identify a

323
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:07,730
male plant before you get three days

324
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,830
into your next flowering cycle so we can

325
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:11,570
prevent this and the next run so we can

326
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:13,430
absolutely tell if the plants are male

327
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:15,710
probably five to seven days

328
00:12:13,429 --> 00:12:17,659
absolutely ten days into flower you

329
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:19,580
should be able to tell so so you've just

330
00:12:17,659 --> 00:12:21,500
got to get familiar with what that looks

331
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:23,509
like that is the next step part three of

332
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:25,279
this question is if you have super seedy

333
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:27,200
flower and you pluck most of it out but

334
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:30,289
a seed or two goes through the grinder

335
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:32,450
is this a really bad thing no back in

336
00:12:30,289 --> 00:12:34,399
the day bro we used to not get seedless

337
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:35,960
weed we used to get weed filled with

338
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,120
seeds we used to buy Mexican brick weed

339
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:40,610
bit you'd grind it up and half of it was

340
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:42,080
seeds unless my buddy Randy was around

341
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:43,580
we weren't getting all those seeds out

342
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:45,080
Randy would make it a mission he could

343
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:46,460
give Randy your bag of weed and say here

344
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:48,560
go for it and Randy would get all the

345
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:49,879
seeds out like that was his damn job but

346
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:51,139
unless he was there there was a good

347
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:53,299
chance you were gonna smoke a schwag

348
00:12:51,139 --> 00:12:54,590
weed seed a brick weed seed there's

349
00:12:53,299 --> 00:12:56,359
nothing wrong with that it might make

350
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:57,889
your joint pop it might make your bowl

351
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:00,080
pop a little bit it might make it taste

352
00:12:57,889 --> 00:13:01,519
like [ __ ] it's not gonna be terrible it

353
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,960
won't be the end of the world and you

354
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,250
said you're gonna put it in a grinder so

355
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,690
you're probably gonna put some nuggets

356
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,159
in the grinder give it a couple of spins

357
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:08,540
you'll hear them you'll hear those seeds

358
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:08,959
go tink tink tink tink team they'll fall

359
00:13:08,539 --> 00:13:10,639
through

360
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:12,129
just be careful open it up dump that

361
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:14,299
weed out get the seeds out of there

362
00:13:12,129 --> 00:13:15,889
depending on the quality of those male

363
00:13:14,299 --> 00:13:17,539
plants and depending on the quality of

364
00:13:15,889 --> 00:13:19,939
those females [ __ ] you may have some

365
00:13:17,539 --> 00:13:21,500
good quality seeds worth growing do not

366
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:23,690
sell them do not pass the

367
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:26,899
your friends don't do anything with them

368
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:28,340
now except for grow them yourself grow

369
00:13:26,899 --> 00:13:31,759
out a few of them see what you've got

370
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:33,710
you may have some completely amazing new

371
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:35,179
process you may have some total [ __ ]

372
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:36,920
that's why I say you can't sell it or

373
00:13:35,179 --> 00:13:38,989
give it away you've got to grow it

374
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:41,599
yourself find out if it's worth a [ __ ]

375
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:43,879
waste your own time energy space and

376
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,470
resources before you waste anybody

377
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:47,419
else's those are free seeds but they

378
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:49,279
could just be a problem if you give them

379
00:13:47,419 --> 00:13:50,959
to anybody so I would grow them that's

380
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:53,000
what I would do with those seeds smoke

381
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:55,070
the product you can smoke grow the seeds

382
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,779
you can grow have fun with it it sounds

383
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:58,370
like you had a problem and your person

384
00:13:56,779 --> 00:13:59,569
will grow but this is an opportunity to

385
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:02,149
learn something you need to learn to

386
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:04,910
identify the males a little bit earlier

387
00:14:02,149 --> 00:14:06,470
we have learned that those females did

388
00:14:04,909 --> 00:14:08,929
not become hermaphroditic that they

389
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:10,610
actually became impregnated we learned a

390
00:14:08,929 --> 00:14:13,309
little bit about breeding so this was a

391
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:14,899
good learning opportunity for you there

392
00:14:13,309 --> 00:14:16,909
is more to the question it says and a

393
00:14:14,899 --> 00:14:20,029
couple other questions about seedlings

394
00:14:16,909 --> 00:14:22,309
and clones in early stages it says I've

395
00:14:20,029 --> 00:14:24,439
read a lot online how you have to cover

396
00:14:22,309 --> 00:14:26,629
clones in a plastic bag or a humidity

397
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:28,850
dome for a while and the same with new

398
00:14:26,629 --> 00:14:30,860
seedlings can you do that in a tent

399
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:33,019
without overheating them and frying them

400
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:36,080
under the dome or would it be better to

401
00:14:33,019 --> 00:14:38,179
just run a small humidifier constantly

402
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:40,310
in the tent to make sure there's enough

403
00:14:38,179 --> 00:14:41,599
moisture thanks and rock on and then

404
00:14:40,309 --> 00:14:43,099
they signed it from Alex

405
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,659
hey Alex thanks for the great email

406
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:47,659
there are a couple of things to touch on

407
00:14:44,659 --> 00:14:50,000
in that last question so you've read a

408
00:14:47,659 --> 00:14:53,029
lot about covering clones in a plastic

409
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,399
bag or a humidity dome yes we do need to

410
00:14:53,029 --> 00:14:57,529
keep clones under some sort of a

411
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:59,269
humidity dome the clones don't have

412
00:14:57,529 --> 00:15:00,860
roots they don't have a way to feed they

413
00:14:59,269 --> 00:15:03,110
don't have a way to eat we've got to

414
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:04,850
keep a nice moist environment so that

415
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:06,919
they can get all of their life from

416
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:08,750
their leaves from the air so that is why

417
00:15:06,919 --> 00:15:11,149
we want to keep the clones nice and

418
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:12,980
humid most of the time we prefer a

419
00:15:11,149 --> 00:15:15,110
humidity dome because it is much easier

420
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:17,870
to control the environment in a little

421
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:20,750
one-foot shoebox size section than it is

422
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:22,759
in a 5 by 5 by 8 grow tent that is a lot

423
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:24,980
different it's a lot of space are going

424
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:27,139
to require a lot more equipment if you

425
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:30,080
want to control that environment in that

426
00:15:27,139 --> 00:15:32,330
giant tent go for it it is going to be a

427
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:33,750
constant struggle to keep a grow tent

428
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:36,270
inside of a room at

429
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:39,779
correct VPD at all times to keep clones

430
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:43,439
alive it will be much easier to do so in

431
00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:46,259
a small clone dome in a large-scale

432
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,760
commercial horticultural environment yes

433
00:15:46,259 --> 00:15:49,799
we would have a room where the

434
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:51,899
environment is just right for the clones

435
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:54,149
you wouldn't even need domes but that is

436
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:56,009
a huge room with all of the appropriate

437
00:15:54,149 --> 00:15:59,220
equipment and it is dedicated to that

438
00:15:56,009 --> 00:16:01,289
and that tent is not in a bedroom inside

439
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:04,110
your house that is in a dedicated space

440
00:16:01,289 --> 00:16:06,599
that is designed built and committed for

441
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:08,610
cloning so it's a huge difference if you

442
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,590
would like to do the entire tent you can

443
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:12,779
absolutely do that but it is going to be

444
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:14,970
a challenge the entire way why not set

445
00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:17,339
yourself up for success use a much

446
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:18,990
smaller environment that's why it is so

447
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:20,759
common because it works we have been

448
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:23,009
doing this for a long time we have

449
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:24,779
figured out a lot of ways to fail and we

450
00:16:23,009 --> 00:16:26,580
have figured out a few ways to be

451
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:29,069
successful so that's why you keep seeing

452
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:30,780
the domes pop up now the question is

453
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:32,910
more specific and it says can you put

454
00:16:30,779 --> 00:16:35,399
the dome in a tent without frying them

455
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:38,129
under the dome yes you absolutely can

456
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:40,259
the tent shouldn't be that hot the tent

457
00:16:38,129 --> 00:16:42,659
shouldn't be any higher than 70 or 80

458
00:16:40,259 --> 00:16:44,669
degrees maybe 84 degrees at the max if

459
00:16:42,659 --> 00:16:46,319
you've got that dome in the tent it's

460
00:16:44,669 --> 00:16:47,759
probably on the floor maybe you've got

461
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,650
it on a little shelf not all the way up

462
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,720
at the top but closer down to the floor

463
00:16:49,649 --> 00:16:54,000
it's okay to get those clones fairly

464
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:55,470
warm we want warmth and humidity for

465
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,330
those clones you're not gonna cook them

466
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:59,100
don't put them on a heat mat I don't

467
00:16:57,330 --> 00:17:01,110
think they need a mat I think they will

468
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:02,850
be okay as long as you're not raging the

469
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:04,410
temperatures in that in that grow tent

470
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:05,910
you should be okay it sounds like you

471
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:07,019
plan on growing a crop in there so

472
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:08,069
you've got to be able to control the

473
00:17:07,019 --> 00:17:09,689
temperature in that tent

474
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:11,549
so yeah unless you're getting that room

475
00:17:09,689 --> 00:17:13,860
that tent up to some crazy ridiculous

476
00:17:11,549 --> 00:17:15,899
temperatures you will be wonderful

477
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:18,029
having your clones inside of a dome

478
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:20,040
inside of that tent I actually did that

479
00:17:18,029 --> 00:17:21,990
for a very long time I had one small veg

480
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:24,539
space and it was inside of a tent

481
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:26,338
I just put my clones flip a five-gallon

482
00:17:24,539 --> 00:17:28,500
bucket upside down use that as a table

483
00:17:26,338 --> 00:17:29,940
put the clone dome right on that [ __ ]

484
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,559
five-gallon bucket so it'd be just

485
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:33,240
elevated just high enough to get enough

486
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:35,519
lights where they would root I think it

487
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:39,210
works beautifully so yes you can put the

488
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:40,589
dome inside of the tent now one thing I

489
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:43,529
do want to touch on that you mentioned

490
00:17:40,589 --> 00:17:46,839
is I do not like to cover my seedlings

491
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:49,808
in any type of humidity dome or a

492
00:17:46,839 --> 00:17:51,939
I like to leave them open and exposed I

493
00:17:49,808 --> 00:17:53,319
like my seedlings to get when I like

494
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:55,090
them to get a little bit stressed out

495
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:57,369
they don't need the moisture like the

496
00:17:55,089 --> 00:17:59,230
clones need the seedlings are developing

497
00:17:57,369 --> 00:18:01,778
a taproot they're exploding with growth

498
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:03,490
at the bottom equally as they're growing

499
00:18:01,778 --> 00:18:05,259
from the top hopefully maybe a little

500
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:06,700
bit more at the bottom I like to see

501
00:18:05,259 --> 00:18:08,319
more root growth than I like to see

502
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:10,330
plant development early on with my

503
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:12,278
seedlings so we don't really need a

504
00:18:10,329 --> 00:18:14,558
humidity dome in that type of situation

505
00:18:12,278 --> 00:18:15,909
I like to kind of stress the seedlings

506
00:18:14,558 --> 00:18:17,859
out to tell you the truth put a little

507
00:18:15,909 --> 00:18:19,240
bit of wind on them make them blow over

508
00:18:17,859 --> 00:18:21,519
a little bit put them in that warm

509
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:23,019
environments they start taking off don't

510
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:25,210
make them [ __ ] from the beginning I

511
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:27,638
want my seedlings to sprout up and go ah

512
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:29,139
[ __ ] I got to get to work immediately I

513
00:18:27,638 --> 00:18:31,269
don't want him to grow up and go huh I

514
00:18:29,138 --> 00:18:32,888
can be a [ __ ] for a little while why

515
00:18:31,269 --> 00:18:35,259
give him the option I just wanted to be

516
00:18:32,888 --> 00:18:37,569
[ __ ] soldiers from day one so I don't

517
00:18:35,259 --> 00:18:39,519
recommend a humidity dome for my

518
00:18:37,569 --> 00:18:43,628
seedlings ever that's not something I do

519
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:45,460
you can absolutely put your clone dome

520
00:18:43,628 --> 00:18:47,259
inside of your tent that will work

521
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:49,929
perfectly for you as long as that tent

522
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:51,759
doesn't get over 80 degrees probably and

523
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:54,548
you can absolutely if you would prefer

524
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:57,069
just fill the tent to the perfect

525
00:18:54,548 --> 00:18:58,749
moisture and temperature but that would

526
00:18:57,069 --> 00:19:00,220
be a constant struggle so big shout out

527
00:18:58,749 --> 00:19:01,600
to our friend Alex I hope I helped you

528
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:03,339
