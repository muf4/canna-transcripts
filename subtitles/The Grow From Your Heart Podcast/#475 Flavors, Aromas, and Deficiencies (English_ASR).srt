1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,710

00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:09,059

flower seeds in your garden I highly

7
00:00:13,259 --> 00:01:05,430
recommend seeds here now and you can

8
00:00:15,539 --> 00:01:06,990
find them at www.cdxzipstream.com it is

9
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:08,850
like you were eating Thanksgiving dinner

10
00:01:06,989 --> 00:01:10,890
at the gas station that's kind of what

11
00:01:08,849 --> 00:01:12,959
this makes me think of then when you dab

12
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:14,579
it that diesel flavor and aroma hits you

13
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:16,438
right in the face it's sort of funky

14
00:01:14,579 --> 00:01:17,489
sort of gross then it's followed up by

15
00:01:16,438 --> 00:01:20,129
that garlicky

16
00:01:17,489 --> 00:01:21,539
robust savory flavor it kind of sits on

17
00:01:20,129 --> 00:01:23,879
your tongue it gives you a really nice

18
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,380
cottonmouth then the buzz just makes you

19
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:27,329
want to chill out it makes me nice and

20
00:01:25,379 --> 00:01:28,679
lazy kind of calms me down which is

21
00:01:27,329 --> 00:01:30,390
something I can use

22
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,070
I tend to be going a little bit fast

23
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:34,650

53
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:46,609
the show all you have to do is visit

54
00:02:32,139 --> 00:02:48,109
www.reimaverick.com of emails printed

55
00:02:46,609 --> 00:02:50,510
here in front of me I am trying to work

56
00:02:48,109 --> 00:02:51,919
my way through the pile if you have sent

57
00:02:50,509 --> 00:02:53,418
me an email and it has not made it to

58
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:55,699
the show yet please do not feel

59
00:02:53,419 --> 00:02:58,669
discouraged I will get to your message I

60
00:02:55,699 --> 00:03:01,069
honestly get about a hundred emails a

61
00:02:58,669 --> 00:03:02,569
day I print out my favorites I put them

62
00:03:01,068 --> 00:03:04,310
here in the pile and then when it comes

63
00:03:02,568 --> 00:03:06,768
time to record I just start at the top

64
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:09,259
and work my way through the email on the

65
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:13,158
top of the pile today goes just like

66
00:03:09,259 --> 00:03:15,019
this Rasta Jeff first and foremost I'd

67
00:03:13,158 --> 00:03:17,658
like to extend my gratitude for all the

68
00:03:15,019 --> 00:03:19,759
time you invest in your podcast platform

69
00:03:17,658 --> 00:03:21,769
I have listened to all but a few of your

70
00:03:19,758 --> 00:03:23,539
episodes and have to say that the amount

71
00:03:21,769 --> 00:03:25,729
of knowledge you have imparted on me is

72
00:03:23,539 --> 00:03:27,828
incredible and I want to extend my

73
00:03:25,729 --> 00:03:29,329
gratefulness and this is a great message

74
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:31,759
I really like starting the show like

75
00:03:29,329 --> 00:03:33,500
this you are very welcome thank you for

76
00:03:31,758 --> 00:03:35,000
listening thank you for learning and

77
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:37,549
thank you for reaching out and

78
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,378
expressing your gratefulness so let's

79
00:03:37,549 --> 00:03:41,930
keep going the message says thank you

80
00:03:39,378 --> 00:03:43,698
your show definitely makes a difference

81
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:45,290
keep up the hard work

82
00:03:43,699 --> 00:03:47,540
I appreciate that not a lot of people

83
00:03:45,289 --> 00:03:49,280
realize that a podcast is hard work

84
00:03:47,539 --> 00:03:50,840
people think I just turn on a microphone

85
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,878
and ramble for 40 minutes and that's how

86
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,680
it goes sometimes it's not that easy

87
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:56,688
sometimes it is that easy but there is

88
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:58,069
prep that goes into it I have to come up

89
00:03:56,688 --> 00:03:59,328
with an idea for a show then I have to

90
00:03:58,068 --> 00:04:00,768
actually do the show then there is

91
00:03:59,329 --> 00:04:02,239
editing and there's posting and there's

92
00:04:00,769 --> 00:04:03,829
a video and there's social media that

93
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,569
goes along with it so there's a lot of

94
00:04:03,829 --> 00:04:07,819
work that goes into a podcast so thank

95
00:04:05,568 --> 00:04:10,008
you for noticing that part of the deal

96
00:04:07,818 --> 00:04:12,008
it goes on to say I do have a couple of

97
00:04:10,008 --> 00:04:15,078
questions for you if you have the time

98
00:04:12,008 --> 00:04:16,759
question number one you mentioned that

99
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:18,978
you will do an episode on your specific

100
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:21,408
breakdown of your use of veg bloom

101
00:04:18,978 --> 00:04:23,418
nutrients I would be very interested in

102
00:04:21,408 --> 00:04:26,089
this as I am currently using their full

103
00:04:23,418 --> 00:04:26,930
line I'd like to see if there are some

104
00:04:26,089 --> 00:04:28,969
better all

105
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:31,160
as I know you were using a blend of

106
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:31,790
their products that is a very good

107
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:35,210
question

108
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:37,370
I do still plan to deliver the nutrient

109
00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:39,168
mix episode I am writing that episode

110
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:41,090
there are going to be a lot of details

111
00:04:39,168 --> 00:04:43,189
in that episode people are going to ask

112
00:04:41,089 --> 00:04:45,469
a lot of questions so I am taking my

113
00:04:43,189 --> 00:04:47,930
time to write that show down and have a

114
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:50,210
lot of notes in most cases I make a very

115
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:51,680
minimal outline so I can keep the show

116
00:04:50,209 --> 00:04:53,810
organic and feel like I'm having a

117
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,519
conversation the episode where I'm going

118
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:57,769
to teach you about my nutrient mix will

119
00:04:55,519 --> 00:05:00,500
be quite detailed so I am taking my time

120
00:04:57,769 --> 00:05:01,969
making that episode I also was trying to

121
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:04,220
get a couple of my friends to be on the

122
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:05,990
show for that episode but the timing for

123
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:07,760
that is not going to work out and now it

124
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:09,740
is starting to snow here in Colorado so

125
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,538
getting people to come to pueblos from

126
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:13,699
Denver or Fort Collins is going to be

127
00:05:11,538 --> 00:05:16,310
challenging so I am now writing that

128
00:05:13,699 --> 00:05:18,410
episode as a solo show and I do plan to

129
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:20,689
bring it to you as soon as I feel like I

130
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:23,120
have got the ingredients and the

131
00:05:20,689 --> 00:05:25,610
instructions and the timeline documented

132
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,649
properly I already know that the moment

133
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:31,220
I drop that episode I'm going to get an

134
00:05:27,649 --> 00:05:32,719
influx of emails asking for more details

135
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:34,760
people are going to have specific

136
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,830
questions I'm trying to cover all of

137
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:39,409
those details and answer those questions

138
00:05:36,829 --> 00:05:41,509
before I put the episode out if you

139
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:43,550
listen to my last episode you'll know

140
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:45,860
that I am just trying to set myself up

141
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:48,379
for a success that's a good example of

142
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:49,970
setting yourself up for a success now

143
00:05:48,379 --> 00:05:52,009
let's keep moving there is a second

144
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:54,710
question in this email the second

145
00:05:52,009 --> 00:05:56,990
question goes just like this I have a

146
00:05:54,709 --> 00:06:00,529
small assortment of some of your seeds

147
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:02,598
that I acquired at the DGC 7/10 Cup I've

148
00:06:00,529 --> 00:06:04,339
been hesitant to pop these until I can

149
00:06:02,598 --> 00:06:06,889
get some to keep in my genetic

150
00:06:04,339 --> 00:06:09,198
collection I love that people collect my

151
00:06:06,889 --> 00:06:11,598
seeds like their baseball cards I really

152
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,370
bred those seeds to be grown but I

153
00:06:11,598 --> 00:06:15,620
really loved that people have taken to

154
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:18,050
collecting my seeds like there are

155
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:20,030
baseball cards or pokemon cards I know

156
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:22,189
people who have got the entire I read

157
00:06:20,029 --> 00:06:24,408
genetics collection they've got seeds

158
00:06:22,189 --> 00:06:26,569
from when I was releasing grateful dog

159
00:06:24,408 --> 00:06:28,279
and heart of gold all the way up to the

160
00:06:26,569 --> 00:06:29,839
lemon Jeffrey they've got the stomper

161
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:31,638
line that most people never even knew

162
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:34,098
about and then of course a lot of people

163
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:36,019
have all of the arize line but some

164
00:06:34,098 --> 00:06:37,610
people have everything and some people

165
00:06:36,019 --> 00:06:39,168
send me a message with their list and

166
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:40,249
they say what am I missing how can I

167
00:06:39,168 --> 00:06:41,988
fill in the gaps

168
00:06:40,249 --> 00:06:43,699
and some people have stuff that I don't

169
00:06:41,988 --> 00:06:45,888
even have anymore so I find that really

170
00:06:43,699 --> 00:06:48,079
impressive but I think it's really neat

171
00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:49,429
that my supporters want to support me in

172
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:52,129
such a way that they feel like they need

173
00:06:49,428 --> 00:06:53,988
to collect everything I release that

174
00:06:52,129 --> 00:06:56,449
really means a lot to me I have a lot of

175
00:06:53,988 --> 00:06:58,848
respect and appreciation for my

176
00:06:56,449 --> 00:07:01,519
supporters my followers my friends my

177
00:06:58,848 --> 00:07:03,048
family my fans I call them the Irie army

178
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:04,939
it really means a lot to me that you

179
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:07,218
guys want to collect everything I put

180
00:07:04,939 --> 00:07:09,439
out and trust me I do realize that

181
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:11,778
without you guys I would not be able to

182
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:13,369
do this so big respect and big thank you

183
00:07:11,778 --> 00:07:15,499
let's keep going with this it says is

184
00:07:13,369 --> 00:07:17,449
there any way to source your gear

185
00:07:15,499 --> 00:07:19,189
locally I live in Denver but I am

186
00:07:17,449 --> 00:07:21,379
frequently in the Colorado Springs

187
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:23,179
Pueblo area so it would not be an issue

188
00:07:21,379 --> 00:07:25,669
for me to travel to any of those

189
00:07:23,178 --> 00:07:27,408
locations all right that is a great

190
00:07:25,668 --> 00:07:29,568
question our friend wants to grow out

191
00:07:27,408 --> 00:07:31,519
the IRA genetics seeds he has already

192
00:07:29,569 --> 00:07:34,069
got but once he does that he's going to

193
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:36,110
have a gap in his collection so he wants

194
00:07:34,069 --> 00:07:38,389
to know if there is a local source for

195
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:42,109
ira genetic seeds in the denver colorado

196
00:07:38,389 --> 00:07:45,009
springs pueblo area and unfortunately my

197
00:07:42,108 --> 00:07:47,899
seeds are not available in any colorado

198
00:07:45,009 --> 00:07:50,179
dispensaries at this time that may

199
00:07:47,899 --> 00:07:52,038
change in the year 2020 but I do not

200
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:55,368
want to make any promises or set any

201
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:57,649
expectations at this current time the

202
00:07:55,369 --> 00:08:02,419
best way to acquire I read genetic seeds

203
00:07:57,649 --> 00:08:07,209
is through seeds here now.com dank seed

204
00:08:02,418 --> 00:08:10,609
dots store or Oregon elite seeds dot-com

205
00:08:07,209 --> 00:08:12,259
however if you are a Colorado local or

206
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:14,658
if you come to the Denver Colorado

207
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:16,338
Springs Pueblo area and you happen to

208
00:08:14,658 --> 00:08:18,709
bump into me there is a good chance that

209
00:08:16,338 --> 00:08:22,309
I will have a lineup of ira genetic

210
00:08:18,709 --> 00:08:25,369
seeds with me I also attend most of the

211
00:08:22,309 --> 00:08:27,439
large events in Colorado so you have a

212
00:08:25,369 --> 00:08:29,989
good opportunity to bump into me at the

213
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:33,199
endo Expo the endo Expo is at the end of

214
00:08:29,988 --> 00:08:35,838
January it is January 25th and 26th at

215
00:08:33,198 --> 00:08:38,240
the Denver Mart in Denver Colorado one

216
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,519
of those days is business day one of

217
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,620
those days is open to the public if you

218
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:45,470
can attend the public day I look forward

219
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:48,169
to seeing you at the endo Expo at this

220
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:50,809
time I also plan to attend the dude

221
00:08:48,169 --> 00:08:53,208
grows cup which will be in April at

222
00:08:50,808 --> 00:08:54,169
cultivated synergy that event has not

223
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:56,539
been announced

224
00:08:54,169 --> 00:08:59,419
book tour schedule but most of the time

225
00:08:56,539 --> 00:09:02,149
we do that event the weekend before or

226
00:08:59,419 --> 00:09:04,789
after 4/20 and it is at cultivated

227
00:09:02,149 --> 00:09:06,709
synergy and it is a consumption friendly

228
00:09:04,789 --> 00:09:08,419
event you will be able to dab with me

229
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:11,000
you will be able to smoke a fat joint

230
00:09:08,419 --> 00:09:12,799
with me but at the end o Expo

231
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,820
there will be no consumption so if

232
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:15,049
you're coming from out of state and

233
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:18,170
you're trying to meet up and take some

234
00:09:15,049 --> 00:09:20,929
dabs the Indo Expo is a no consumption

235
00:09:18,169 --> 00:09:22,370
event the dude grows cup which has not

236
00:09:20,929 --> 00:09:24,049
been announced or confirmed yet but it

237
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:25,549
more than likely will happen because I'm

238
00:09:24,049 --> 00:09:27,289
kind of forcing it right now I'm

239
00:09:25,549 --> 00:09:30,529
manifesting that it's going to happen

240
00:09:27,289 --> 00:09:32,240
that is a consumption friendly event so

241
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:34,189
you can show up we could take some dabs

242
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,080
we can smoke a joint and we can spend

243
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:37,460
some time together so if you're in

244
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,410
Colorado if you're in the Denver

245
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:40,910
Colorado Springs or Pueblo area there's

246
00:09:39,409 --> 00:09:42,620
a good chance we could run into each

247
00:09:40,909 --> 00:09:44,480
other if we don't run into each other

248
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:46,519
organically or we don't set something up

249
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,620
I'm sure you can find me at the endo

250
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:50,120
Expo they have not assigned me a booth

251
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:51,289
number yet but I'm sure I will be easy

252
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,029
to find it will be in all the

253
00:09:51,289 --> 00:09:55,129
advertising my booth number will be on

254
00:09:53,029 --> 00:09:57,620
the guide I've got a really large banner

255
00:09:55,129 --> 00:09:59,809
and I'm also six foot five and I've got

256
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:02,000
dreadlocks to my ass almost to my knees

257
00:09:59,809 --> 00:10:04,879
so I should be pretty easy to identify

258
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,919
so find me at the endo Expo if you don't

259
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:10,009
make it to the endo Expo find me at the

260
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:11,449

or gives me some type of new perspective

328
00:12:25,789 --> 00:12:30,409
so I truly appreciate all of the work

329
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,399
that you put into them hey that means a

330
00:12:30,409 --> 00:12:33,799
lot to me man thank you

331
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:35,240
knowing that I am sparking your brain to

332
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:37,159
think in a different direction or maybe

333
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,879
just making you look at the grow from

334
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:39,620
another angle

335
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:41,090
that is kind of my goal because that is

336
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:42,799
how we learn if you keep looking at

337
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:44,540
things straight forward you're only

338
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:46,399
gonna see the straightforward view if

339
00:12:44,539 --> 00:12:47,750
you take a step to the left oh my God

340
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,519
look at all that other [ __ ] we can see

341
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:51,590
from over here go take a step to the

342
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:53,600
right oh my god all kinds of new [ __ ]

343
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:55,430
you can see over here I like knowing

344
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,379
that you are learning something new from

345
00:12:55,429 --> 00:12:59,750
each episode but it really means a lot

346
00:12:57,379 --> 00:13:01,879
to me to hear that I am giving you a new

347
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:04,519
perspective so thank you for telling me

348
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:06,529
that that is a huge compliment and again

349
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:08,269
thank you for noticing all of the work

350
00:13:06,529 --> 00:13:09,740
that I do put into these episodes we

351
00:13:08,269 --> 00:13:12,199
talked about that in the last message

352
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:14,029
and it is a little bit of work let me

353
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:16,370
keep going with this email because I am

354
00:13:14,029 --> 00:13:17,779
getting rambley this email says the

355
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:19,909
first question I have doesn't really

356
00:13:17,779 --> 00:13:21,470
have to do anything with growing but

357
00:13:19,909 --> 00:13:24,199
more about identifying and

358
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:26,149
scribing the seemingly limitless smells

359
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:28,820
and flavors which come from the cannabis

360
00:13:26,149 --> 00:13:30,500
plants throughout Instagram and on your

361
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:35,450
podcast I often hear people describe

362
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:37,279
buds as smelling cushy hazy or og every

363
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:39,800
time I try to ask someone what this

364
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:41,990
exactly means the person has a very hard

365
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:44,209
time describing it to me in a way I can

366
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:46,700
get a real feel for what I'm supposed to

367
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:48,290
be looking for that is a very good

368
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:50,180
question because sometimes it can be

369
00:13:48,289 --> 00:13:52,129
challenging to try and describe some of

370
00:13:50,179 --> 00:13:53,899
these aromas and flavors some of them

371
00:13:52,129 --> 00:13:56,480
are very complex some are very obvious

372
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:58,549
sometimes it is challenging to put your

373
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,350
nose and a label on all of these

374
00:13:58,549 --> 00:14:02,179
different smells and aromas and all this

375
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:03,649
different information we are receiving

376
00:14:02,179 --> 00:14:05,959
so let's spend a couple of minutes

377
00:14:03,649 --> 00:14:07,879
talking about some of the most common

378
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:10,430
flavors and aromas people talk about

379
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:12,950
when we are describing cannabis plants

380
00:14:10,429 --> 00:14:15,319
now the first one you asked about was

381
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:16,940
Khushi but I want to start with diesel

382
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:18,350
because diesel is going to help me

383
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:20,750
describe a few more things

384
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:23,210
the reason the strained diesel is called

385
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:25,490
diesel is because it smells like a

386
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:28,519
barrel of diesel fuel that has got a

387
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:30,200
funky sort of a astringent sharp smell

388
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:32,000
to it that kind of makes your your nose

389
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:34,160
it makes my nose want to wrinkle up a

390
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,860
little bit I feel it in my eyes it is a

391
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:38,990
very chemically dominant kind of a smell

392
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:40,669
it smells like diesel fuel there's

393
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:42,379
nothing that smells like diesel fuel

394
00:14:40,669 --> 00:14:45,019
other than diesel fuel that is why the

395
00:14:42,379 --> 00:14:46,659
strained diesel got that name if you

396
00:14:45,019 --> 00:14:49,309
have got a bag of properly grown

397
00:14:46,659 --> 00:14:50,990
real-deal diesel in your pocket

398
00:14:49,309 --> 00:14:54,199
you smell like somebody just poured

399
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:57,980
diesel fuel in your pocket on your shoes

400
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:59,450
it is a very noticeable pungent aroma so

401
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:01,670
I want to start this with that diesel

402
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:04,009
fuel aroma because most of us know what

403
00:15:01,669 --> 00:15:06,259
that smells like I think it smells warm

404
00:15:04,009 --> 00:15:08,419
I think it smells like chemicals I think

405
00:15:06,259 --> 00:15:10,370
it smells sharp I feel like I can feel

406
00:15:08,419 --> 00:15:12,289
it in my nose and I feel like when I get

407
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:12,889
too close to it it makes me squint a

408
00:15:12,289 --> 00:15:15,500
little bit

409
00:15:12,889 --> 00:15:17,809
there is also an underlying hint of

410
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:20,960
skunk when it comes to the diesel strain

411
00:15:17,809 --> 00:15:23,419
so think of diesel fuel and skunk I'm

412
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:25,190
going to try to build this flavor and

413
00:15:23,419 --> 00:15:27,079
this aroma in your mind we have got

414
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:29,390
diesel fuel with a little bit of a skunk

415
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:31,340
background maybe somebody was putting

416
00:15:29,389 --> 00:15:33,169
fuel in the diesel truck and got sprayed

417
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:35,480
by a skunk that's kind of the aroma that

418
00:15:33,169 --> 00:15:37,819
we were working with it is funky it

419
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:40,399
is gross but for some reason it is

420
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:41,930
really delicious and really desirable

421
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,778
when it comes to cannabis

422
00:15:41,929 --> 00:15:46,969
so skunk and diesel are two great bases

423
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:48,409
to start with two very obvious aromas

424
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:51,050
and two things that I think people

425
00:15:48,409 --> 00:15:54,019
should be familiar with now let's work

426
00:15:51,049 --> 00:15:56,509
our way toward cush and when we say cush

427
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:58,459
I'm talking about oh gee cush you listed

428
00:15:56,509 --> 00:16:00,860
the flavor oh gee and you also listed

429
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:02,809
the word cush as flavors those are sort

430
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:05,629
of going to kind of fall into the same

431
00:16:02,809 --> 00:16:07,879
palette here oh gee cush is a variety of

432
00:16:05,629 --> 00:16:09,828
cush but it is the og it's the one we

433
00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:11,570
should kind of base the flavor on then

434
00:16:09,828 --> 00:16:13,638
everybody bred the cush to other things

435
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:15,528
and it started to dilute the cush flavor

436
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:17,240
we wanted to add bananas and

437
00:16:15,528 --> 00:16:19,698
strawberries and oranges so we've got

438
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:23,389
orange cush banana cush but let's focus

439
00:16:19,698 --> 00:16:25,819
on the original og cush flavor so I've

440
00:16:23,389 --> 00:16:27,620
built a nice idea of what the diesel and

441
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:29,660
skunk aroma would kind of be like in

442
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:32,028
your head so let's kind of dial back the

443
00:16:29,659 --> 00:16:34,309
diesel aroma a little bit and let's add

444
00:16:32,028 --> 00:16:36,828
a little bit of pine to that maybe some

445
00:16:34,309 --> 00:16:38,239
fresh pine trees maybe one of those pine

446
00:16:36,828 --> 00:16:40,278
tree air fresheners you put in the

447
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,589
window of the car add some of that aroma

448
00:16:40,278 --> 00:16:44,539
to it so we've got some skunk ass we've

449
00:16:42,589 --> 00:16:46,610
got a little bit of diesel feel now we

450
00:16:44,539 --> 00:16:48,740
are putting pine on top of it now we are

451
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:51,409
starting to get a little bit closer to

452
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:54,799
that og cush flavor now on top of that

453
00:16:51,409 --> 00:16:57,528
skunk ass that diesel feel and a little

454
00:16:54,799 --> 00:17:00,318
bit of pine I also want to add just a

455
00:16:57,528 --> 00:17:02,269
hint of dirty feet just enough to make

456
00:17:00,318 --> 00:17:03,860
you go what the [ __ ] and I know we've

457
00:17:02,269 --> 00:17:06,709
already got skunk and diesel in there

458
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:09,110
but that dirty rotten foot just just a

459
00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:11,209
little dirty rotten foot really makes

460
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:13,729
the rest of those aromas pop I know that

461
00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:15,949
sounds disgusting but that dirty foot

462
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:18,679
aroma it comes out you got to smell it

463
00:17:15,949 --> 00:17:21,289
and then you smell it it doesn't happen

464
00:17:18,679 --> 00:17:23,630
on the original smell you go oooh diesel

465
00:17:21,289 --> 00:17:25,909
and skunk and pine oh there's a foot in

466
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:28,490
there it hits you second so we've got

467
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:30,200
fuel and skunk then we've put pine in

468
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:31,429
there now we've put a little bit of a

469
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,740
dirty foot in there

470
00:17:31,429 --> 00:17:35,990
now the next aromas i want to add are a

471
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:38,210
little bit of dankness and maybe a

472
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:39,919
little bit of swamp enos think about

473
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:41,690
like if you go into a basement that's

474
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:43,850
been sealed up for too long if it's kind

475
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:46,070
of smells a little musty a little damp a

476
00:17:43,849 --> 00:17:46,929
little dank in there that flavor

477
00:17:46,069 --> 00:17:49,629
kind of

478
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:52,150
comes in at the end of the OG Kush so it

479
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:54,400
starts off skunky and fuelie and then

480
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:56,530
it's got that pine dominance to it then

481
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:59,230
there's a feet aroma to it and then when

482
00:17:56,529 --> 00:18:01,480
it finishes it is musty and funky and

483
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:03,579
dank now I hope I have painted a good

484
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:05,349
picture in your mind I can almost taste

485
00:18:03,579 --> 00:18:08,019
some OG Kush right now from all these

486
00:18:05,349 --> 00:18:10,539
descriptors now there will be variations

487
00:18:08,019 --> 00:18:12,849
on this depending on which cush you are

488
00:18:10,539 --> 00:18:15,099
smoking are you smoking oh gee Kush you

489
00:18:12,849 --> 00:18:17,259
smoking bubba kush do you have tahoe OG

490
00:18:15,099 --> 00:18:19,779
there are a lot of different pushes

491
00:18:17,259 --> 00:18:22,690
available and unfortunately there are a

492
00:18:19,779 --> 00:18:24,460
lot of plants and jars of weed out there

493
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:27,190
labeled cush that do not have any

494
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:29,410
cushion the genetics when the medical

495
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:32,950
marijuana movement swept colorado i

496
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:34,630
watched everybody go cush crazy I went

497
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:36,970
to the dispensary on Friday that had a

498
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:39,490
big variety it all smelled pretty decent

499
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:41,799
it all had neat names then cush got

500
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:43,599
popular I went on Monday and everything

501
00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:46,119
had cush at the end of the name orange

502
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:48,279
cush strawberry cush blueberry cush

503
00:18:46,119 --> 00:18:50,229
none of that [ __ ] was called cush last

504
00:18:48,279 --> 00:18:51,549
week it just got popular so everybody

505
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:53,920
through the name cush at the end of it

506
00:18:51,549 --> 00:18:56,470
and unfortunately that does work as a

507
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:58,960
great sales tactic in the medical and

508
00:18:56,470 --> 00:19:00,549
recreational cannabis market so when

509
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:04,029
you're thinking about cush you should

510
00:19:00,549 --> 00:19:06,549
think fuel and skunk and pine and feet

511
00:19:04,029 --> 00:19:08,680
and dankness maybe a little bit of

512
00:19:06,549 --> 00:19:12,190
swampy smell I kind of think it's got

513
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:15,279
like a warm and savory smell some cush

514
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:17,799
varietals will have a chocolate or a

515
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:20,680
coffee or maybe a dirt sort of a smell

516
00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:22,629
to it again this depends on which cush

517
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:25,509
you are smoking and also this will

518
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:27,880
depend on how it was grown and dried and

519
00:19:25,509 --> 00:19:32,289
cured let's talk about some things that

520
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:34,660
cush is not og cush is not sweet oh gee

521
00:19:32,289 --> 00:19:37,299
cush does not taste like candy oh gee

522
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:38,950
cush does not taste like berries if you

523
00:19:37,299 --> 00:19:41,889
were getting product that smells like

524
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:45,100
berries or fruit it is not real OG Kush

525
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:47,410
it is possibly some outcross of a cush

526
00:19:45,099 --> 00:19:48,669
you may have like maybe og cush two

527
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:50,650
jellybeans will give you some orange

528
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:52,570
flavored cush maybe og cush the

529
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:54,490
blueberry would give you a blue cush but

530
00:19:52,569 --> 00:19:57,849
if it tastes too fruity it is probably

531
00:19:54,490 --> 00:20:00,460
not cush dominant a good og cush is more

532
00:19:57,849 --> 00:20:05,889
on that gassy fuel chemical

533
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:08,350
Pyne dank musty skunky swampy chocolate

534
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:11,470
coffee dirt sort of side of the aroma

535
00:20:08,349 --> 00:20:14,469
palette it will be very easy to confuse

536
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:17,230
the aromas of a good og cush with some

537
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:19,180
of the Kim dog or diesel varietals but

538
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:23,380
the main difference is going to be that

539
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:25,269
darker pine chocolate coffee swampy sort

540
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:26,950
of a thing the chem dog is going to have

541
00:20:25,269 --> 00:20:28,690
that chemical aroma it's gonna have the

542
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:31,210
skunk in the feet but it's going to be

543
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:33,759
more on the ah like a fresh can of

544
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:35,620
tennis balls or fresh tires you're also

545
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:36,789
gonna have that aroma in there so

546
00:20:35,619 --> 00:20:38,889
there's a little bit of a difference

547
00:20:36,789 --> 00:20:41,349
when it comes to the Kim's the diesels

548
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:43,570
and the cush is unfortunately the only

549
00:20:41,349 --> 00:20:45,819
real way to smell something is to smell

550
00:20:43,569 --> 00:20:48,309
something so I recommend coming to

551
00:20:45,819 --> 00:20:50,710
Colorado heading to a legal state and

552
00:20:48,309 --> 00:20:53,109
going to a reputable dispensary and

553
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:55,240
smelling some good Kush and smelling

554
00:20:53,109 --> 00:20:56,949
some good haze and smelling some good

555
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:58,960
whatever else is available so that you

556
00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:00,580
can kind of get a nice idea of what the

557
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,470
different options are and what different

558
00:21:00,579 --> 00:21:04,419
things smell like so I think it's time

559
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:06,610
for you to start planning a road trip

560
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:08,380
this listener does ask a few more

561
00:21:06,609 --> 00:21:11,139
questions to ask about haze how do we

562
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:14,080
describe the flavor of haze that is a

563
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:16,060
very unique flavor I describe haze as a

564
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:18,970
sandalwood flavor it's got a woody

565
00:21:16,059 --> 00:21:21,549
flavor sometimes I think haze smells a

566
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:24,460
little bit like a gentle incense it also

567
00:21:21,549 --> 00:21:26,859
sometimes has a bit of a spicy flavor to

568
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:28,900
it sometimes I describe haze as a green

569
00:21:26,859 --> 00:21:31,269
apple sort of a flavor so it's

570
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:33,370
sandalwood it's incense it's a little

571
00:21:31,269 --> 00:21:35,500
bit spicy and it's got a green apple

572
00:21:33,369 --> 00:21:38,079
flavor it's harder for me to describe

573
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:41,289
the flavor of a haze because it haze is

574
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:44,500
not as common a true haze plant is going

575
00:21:41,289 --> 00:21:47,740
to take at least 11 or 12 probably 14

576
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:49,450
weeks if you're smoking the true haze so

577
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:52,059
it's going to be very unlikely that you

578
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:53,710
run into a true haze plant you may find

579
00:21:52,059 --> 00:21:55,899
some haze crosses just like I was

580
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:59,259
talking about the OG Kush but a pure

581
00:21:55,900 --> 00:22:01,420
haze is going to be very unlikely things

582
00:21:59,259 --> 00:22:03,670
you can look for in a haze flavor like I

583
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:06,310
mentioned earlier are that woody flavor

584
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:08,710
sort of a sandalwood flavor some Hayes's

585
00:22:06,309 --> 00:22:10,869
have a spicy green apple type of a

586
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:13,960
flavor to them some of them have got a

587
00:22:10,869 --> 00:22:15,369
sweet perfumey sort of aroma to them

588
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:17,500
but most of the Haze's I have

589
00:22:15,369 --> 00:22:18,969
experienced have been a hybrid duper

590
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:20,589
cross with something else to reduce

591
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:23,440
flowering time because like I mentioned

592
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:25,569
earlier a good haze takes too damn long

593
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:28,360
to flower so it's very unlikely you're

594
00:22:25,569 --> 00:22:29,950
going to find a pure haze unless you or

595
00:22:28,359 --> 00:22:32,259
one of your very close friends are

596
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:34,240
growing it for yourselves so I know my

597
00:22:32,259 --> 00:22:36,038
description of the flavor of haze was

598
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,649
not as nearly in depth as my flavor

599
00:22:36,038 --> 00:22:40,658
description of OG but that tells you how

600
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:43,599
much haze I have been exposed to and how

601
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:45,970
much og cush I have been exposed to like

602
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:47,639
I said a moment ago in Colorado when the

603
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:49,778
medical marijuana market took off

604
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:52,179
everybody went cush crazy

605
00:22:49,778 --> 00:22:53,409
since haze takes so long to grow you

606
00:22:52,179 --> 00:22:56,440
don't see it here in the commercial

607
00:22:53,409 --> 00:22:59,169
market the legal cannabis cultivation

608
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:01,480
market in Colorado is already trying to

609
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:04,480
find ways to pinch every penny and save

610
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:06,970
every dollar so growing at 12 to 14 week

611
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:09,130
cultivar is really not an option in a

612
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:10,990
commercial cultivation facility

613
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:13,480
alright there is more to this message it

614
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:15,548
says being a relatively young ish grower

615
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:17,140
I started smoking cannabis right after

616
00:23:15,548 --> 00:23:19,418
college and then began growing a few

617
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:21,309
years back I am unfamiliar with what

618
00:23:19,419 --> 00:23:23,620
these strains are supposed to smell like

619
00:23:21,308 --> 00:23:25,629
I feel like this question is great for

620
00:23:23,619 --> 00:23:28,089
you because you do a very good job at

621
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:30,940
describing smells and flavors and seem

622
00:23:28,089 --> 00:23:32,528
to have a real gift for doing so hey

623
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:34,929
thank you for that I hope I did a good

624
00:23:32,528 --> 00:23:37,359
job I apologize that I did not have a

625
00:23:34,929 --> 00:23:39,130
thoroughly detailed description on haze

626
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:41,619
but I think I made up for it with my

627
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:43,240
great description on the Kush so there

628
00:23:41,619 --> 00:23:45,639
is still more to this email the last

629
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:47,409
paragraph says my other question is when

630
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:50,409
should I expect to see fading in my

631
00:23:47,409 --> 00:23:52,179
plants for an organic grow I'm worried

632
00:23:50,409 --> 00:23:54,340
that the beginning of fade I see earlier

633
00:23:52,179 --> 00:23:56,140
on in flower and then he says weeks four

634
00:23:54,339 --> 00:23:58,509
and five is a nutrient deficiency I

635
00:23:56,140 --> 00:24:01,778
should deal with rather than an actual

636
00:23:58,509 --> 00:24:03,548
proper fade then he wraps the email up

637
00:24:01,778 --> 00:24:05,259
with thanks again for everything you do

638
00:24:03,548 --> 00:24:07,240
I will continue to support you via

639
00:24:05,259 --> 00:24:09,669
patreon and I will continue to look

640
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:12,548
forward to every new episode you roll

641
00:24:09,669 --> 00:24:13,750
out best and then they sign their name I

642
00:24:12,548 --> 00:24:15,609
don't know if you want your name set on

643
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:18,130
the show so big thank you for the great

644
00:24:15,609 --> 00:24:20,528
email let's talk about this fading

645
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:22,809
question the question is when should I

646
00:24:20,528 --> 00:24:25,119
expect to see fading and my plants in an

647
00:24:22,808 --> 00:24:28,139
organic grow because this listener is

648
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:29,879
worried that the fade is beginning to

649
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:31,919
this listener has plants that are in

650
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:34,350
weeks four or five and they are showing

651
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:37,110
a fade and they are in fear that it is a

652
00:24:34,349 --> 00:24:39,058
nutrient deficiency yes that is probably

653
00:24:37,109 --> 00:24:41,699
a nutrient deficiency let's talk about

654
00:24:39,058 --> 00:24:44,069
what the fade is toward the end of the

655
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:46,319
flowering phase we like to flush our

656
00:24:44,069 --> 00:24:48,899
plants which means we are removing all

657
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:50,730
of the built-up nutrients from the soil

658
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:52,890
the soil is mix or whatever you've got

659
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:55,529
in your container we're just feeding

660
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:57,390
water for 10 to 14 days to rinse out

661
00:24:55,529 --> 00:24:58,798
that container so the plants don't have

662
00:24:57,390 --> 00:25:00,450
anything to eat and then they

663
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:02,369
essentially begin to cannibalize

664
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:04,319
themselves they will use their stored

665
00:25:02,369 --> 00:25:06,178
nutrients which are stored within the

666
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:07,589
plant cells it will start sucking that

667
00:25:06,179 --> 00:25:09,240
up that's all of their life that are

668
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:10,859
basically working off that fat belly

669
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:12,720
then once they don't have a fat belly

670
00:25:10,859 --> 00:25:15,029
they're starving they begin looking a

671
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,740
little bit yellow that is exactly what

672
00:25:15,029 --> 00:25:18,899
we want at the last part of the

673
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:20,788
flowering phase flushing the plants

674
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:22,679
cleaning out all of those nutrients will

675
00:25:20,788 --> 00:25:24,329
make that final dried and cured bud

676
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:26,700
taste delicious

677
00:25:24,329 --> 00:25:28,230
so later in Flour we look to see what we

678
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:30,900
call the fade we just want to watch

679
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:33,419
those leaves slowly turn from robust

680
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:35,490
lush green leaves to kind of faded out

681
00:25:33,419 --> 00:25:37,288
yellow leaves some cultivars will get

682
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:39,419
really unique colors you'll see some

683
00:25:37,288 --> 00:25:42,058
purples and oranges and yellows you'll

684
00:25:39,419 --> 00:25:44,520
see a nice fall display come out of your

685
00:25:42,058 --> 00:25:46,678
grow room our friend here has this

686
00:25:44,519 --> 00:25:49,139
happening way too early it is happening

687
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:52,019
in weeks 4 &amp; 5 which means we have got a

688
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:53,909
nutrient deficiency without more info

689
00:25:52,019 --> 00:25:56,579
without some pictures or some details I

690
00:25:53,909 --> 00:25:58,500
cannot identify the deficiency but if

691
00:25:56,579 --> 00:25:59,879
you were at week four or five in an

692
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:01,589
organic grow and you were seeing

693
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:03,390
yellowing you were going to be

694
00:26:01,589 --> 00:26:05,038
struggling until the end of this girl

695
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:06,929
you were doing what is called chasing

696
00:26:05,038 --> 00:26:08,519
the plant you are never going to catch

697
00:26:06,929 --> 00:26:11,070
up with that plants appetite for

698
00:26:08,519 --> 00:26:13,019
nutrients you did state that the grow is

699
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:15,119
organic I don't know if you're using a

700
00:26:13,019 --> 00:26:17,579
super soil or some sort of amended soil

701
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:20,250
or if you were feeding teas or maybe

702
00:26:17,579 --> 00:26:23,009
even organic bottled nutrients but you

703
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:25,950
do need to increase your feedings I may

704
00:26:23,009 --> 00:26:28,319
recommend some type of a foliar feed one

705
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:30,960
thing I will really suggest is don't try

706
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:34,619
to correct this issue by radically

707
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:37,019
increasing your feeds a major increase

708
00:26:34,619 --> 00:26:40,349
in feed is only going to cause more

709
00:26:37,019 --> 00:26:41,279
problems I would carefully diagnose the

710
00:26:40,349 --> 00:26:42,990
issue with the plan

711
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:44,849
what do you feel like the plant is

712
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:47,160
deficient and is it showing a nitrogen

713
00:26:44,849 --> 00:26:49,619
deficiency is it phosphorus or potassium

714
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:52,500
deficient does it need cal-mag let's

715
00:26:49,619 --> 00:26:54,479
correctly identify the deficiency then

716
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:56,400
let's use the appropriate amendment to

717
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:59,549
fix that deficiency I don't know again

718
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:01,140
if you're using super soil or teas or an

719
00:26:59,549 --> 00:27:02,549
amended soil I don't know what you're

720
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:05,520
using so I don't know what the solution

721
00:27:02,549 --> 00:27:07,619
will be when you're using organics many

722
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:10,410
of those products will take several days

723
00:27:07,619 --> 00:27:12,659
if not several weeks to break down and

724
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:14,790
become bioavailable for that plant to

725
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:17,250
uptake to help solving your problem

726
00:27:14,789 --> 00:27:19,109
that's why I recommend a full-year feed

727
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:21,750
you may be able to help this plan out by

728
00:27:19,109 --> 00:27:23,250
directly spraying these nutrients on to

729
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:24,720
the plant don't spray undiluted

730
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:26,880
nutrients onto the plant

731
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:29,190
if you're going to foliar feed makes up

732
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:31,200
the appropriate nutrient dilute it very

733
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:33,090
very light we don't need strong

734
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:36,390
nutrients directly applied to the plants

735
00:27:33,089 --> 00:27:38,250
very low ratios then spray that onto the

736
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:40,770
plant and then watch the plant recover

737
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:43,259
over a few days do not go in there and

738
00:27:40,769 --> 00:27:44,730
think my plant is nitrogen deficient I'm

739
00:27:43,259 --> 00:27:46,740
gonna feed the [ __ ] out of it with a

740
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:48,809
bunch of nitrogen and fix this problem

741
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:51,450
that will not work we need to increase

742
00:27:48,809 --> 00:27:53,690
the nitrogen a little bit and then feed

743
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:55,890
it frequently and pay attention

744
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:57,930
unfortunately you probably will not be

745
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:59,759
able to catch up to this plant those

746
00:27:57,930 --> 00:28:01,710
leaves that look like [ __ ] will always

747
00:27:59,759 --> 00:28:03,900
look like [ __ ] if they are really

748
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:05,910
terrible pull them right off they don't

749
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:09,150
have to stay there just make sure that

750
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:11,610
the new growth is healthy so carefully

751
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:14,100
identify the deficiency then let's

752
00:28:11,609 --> 00:28:15,689
increase that nutrient I'm not sure how

753
00:28:14,099 --> 00:28:16,919
you're going to deliver that nutrient to

754
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:19,230
the plant because I don't know your

755
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:21,120
style of grow but it definitely sounds

756
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:24,120
like you are fading too early because

757
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:26,849
you have got a deficiency if you did use

758
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:28,859
a super soil or an amended soil it needs

759
00:28:26,849 --> 00:28:31,500
to be a little richer next time or you

760
00:28:28,859 --> 00:28:32,759
need to veg for less time and again I

761
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:34,500
know I keep saying this but without

762
00:28:32,759 --> 00:28:36,329
seeing your plants and without a little

763
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:38,369
more information it's hard for me to

764
00:28:36,329 --> 00:28:40,289
diagnose exactly what you are deficient

765
00:28:38,369 --> 00:28:42,689
in but it does sound like you were

766
00:28:40,289 --> 00:28:44,730
experiencing a nutrient deficiency in

767
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:46,440
your garden now before somebody out

768
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:48,480
there starts typing an email let me

769
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:51,269
address what I just said I did recommend

770
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:53,730
foliar feeding these plants that are in

771
00:28:51,269 --> 00:28:55,019
flower they're nutrient deficient they

772
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:56,549
are going to struggle all

773
00:28:55,019 --> 00:28:59,099
way through their life if we don't take

774
00:28:56,549 --> 00:29:01,470
action we are four or five weeks into

775
00:28:59,099 --> 00:29:04,079
flower I am assuming these buds are not

776
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:06,990
giant and chunky because bitter nutrient

777
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:09,750
deficient I think one or two foliar

778
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:11,910
feeds at the right time will rescue

779
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:13,890
these plants and not cause too much risk

780
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:15,330
of causing a problem to the buds we

781
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:17,400
won't get any bud mold because there's

782
00:29:15,329 --> 00:29:19,019
not but there and we're not springing a

783
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:21,690
pesticide so it is not going to

784
00:29:19,019 --> 00:29:23,190
contaminate our final product so if

785
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:24,930
you're typing an email because I just

786
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:27,750
told somebody to follow your feet in

787
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:30,240
week four or five just it cancel it's

788
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:32,190
going to be okay as long as those buds

789
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:34,019
aren't giant and chunky and as long as

790
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:35,789
we're not applying a pesticide and as

791
00:29:34,019 --> 00:29:37,650
long as we don't completely soak those

792
00:29:35,789 --> 00:29:39,000
plants like a giant sponge and then

793
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:40,950
close the room up and let it get

794
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,319
stagnant I think that this will be a

795
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:46,440
good idea to foliar feed those plants

796
00:29:43,319 --> 00:29:48,539
with the correct nutrients now I will

797
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:51,299
assume that you want to keep your garden

798
00:29:48,539 --> 00:29:53,879
as organic as possible but think about

799
00:29:51,299 --> 00:29:55,950
this many of the organics will take time

800
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:59,010
to become bioavailable to your plant

801
00:29:55,950 --> 00:30:02,460
your plant is already struggling salt

802
00:29:59,009 --> 00:30:05,369
based bottled nutrients are much more

803
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:08,130
bioavailable to your plant and will be

804
00:30:05,369 --> 00:30:11,369
up taken by the plant almost immediately

805
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:14,130
upon that nutrient finding a root you

806
00:30:11,369 --> 00:30:16,439
will have much more success and much

807
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:18,840
more chance of rescuing this plant if

808
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:22,440
you bite the bullet and use a

809
00:30:18,839 --> 00:30:25,220
non-organic bottled nutrient to attack

810
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:27,779
your problem if you want to stay organic

811
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:30,120
disregard that advice but if you really

812
00:30:27,779 --> 00:30:32,549
want to rescue these plants it may be

813
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:35,969
time to think about switching it up and

814
00:30:32,549 --> 00:30:38,129
adding a non-organic ingredient to your

815
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:39,839
grow again if that's not something

816
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:42,270
