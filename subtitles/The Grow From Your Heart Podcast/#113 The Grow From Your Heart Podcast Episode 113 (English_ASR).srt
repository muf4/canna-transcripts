yearly there are a couple things on that

167
00:05:48,278 --> 00:05:52,569
list so I think I'm gonna take a DAB and

168
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:54,158
a drink while you guys listen to a

169

get into this checklist I hope you guys

180
00:07:06,939 --> 00:07:10,660
think it's a bad low I was taking dad's

181
00:07:08,379 --> 00:07:12,909
I just hit some cactus cooler from turf

182
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:14,470
backs if you've ever a cracked open a

183
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:16,360
can of cactus cooler or taking a drink

184
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:18,490
it's exactly what this hash tastes like

185
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,720
it's kind of got my mouth watering you

186
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:22,689
ever taken a DAB that made your mouth

187
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:23,890
water usually your mouth goes dry excuse

188
00:07:22,689 --> 00:07:25,959
me for coughing into the microphone I

189
00:07:23,889 --> 00:07:27,399
was listening to a podcast today and the

190
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:29,049
co-host was just coughing into the

191
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:30,759
microphone err I really wanted to turn

192
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:33,460
off the damn show so I apologize for

193
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:35,139
coughing into the mic anyway on this

194
00:07:33,459 --> 00:07:37,149
check list here we go this is stuff that

195
00:07:35,139 --> 00:07:39,370
I feel you should be doing every day

196
00:07:37,149 --> 00:07:40,959
some of this stuff will vary if you've

197
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:42,189
got a hydro garden some of this stuff

198
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:43,449
will be different if you've got a soil

199
00:07:42,189 --> 00:07:45,668
garden some of this stuff will be

200
00:07:43,449 --> 00:07:47,259
different based on the size of your

201
00:07:45,668 --> 00:07:48,939
garden some of this stuff will have to

202
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:51,939
be done over a course of a couple of

203
00:07:48,939 --> 00:07:53,860
days some of this stuff will have to be

204
00:07:51,939 --> 00:07:55,269
if you've got a little garden this stuff

205
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:58,360
is just things it'll take you two

206
00:07:55,269 --> 00:08:01,449
seconds so here is what I've got for

207
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:03,400
your daily checklist daily visually

208
00:08:01,449 --> 00:08:05,228
check each plant for bugs moulds or

209
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:08,469
signs of deficiencies or over

210
00:08:05,228 --> 00:08:11,199
fertilization and correct if necessary

211
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:12,940
oh you got to get in there I walk in and

212
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,680
I just pick a random plant and I just

213
00:08:12,939 --> 00:08:16,779
pull a random leaf off of a random plant

214
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:18,100
I flip it upside down and I look at it

215
00:08:16,779 --> 00:08:20,168
and I make sure there's no bugs

216
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:22,600
I feel the leaf I can tell by feeling

217
00:08:20,168 --> 00:08:24,189
the leaf how healthy the plant is I can

218
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,750
kind of rub on the leaf and tell but I

219
00:08:24,189 --> 00:08:27,759
like to pull leaf off look for bugs look

220
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:29,500
for molds I look around the room see if

221
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,930
any of the leaves are yellow or crispy

222
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:33,309
or crunchy or if anything's happening if

223
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:36,310
you've got anything weird going in there

224
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:38,978
work on correcting it something I should

225
00:08:36,309 --> 00:08:40,449
add anything that can be done today do

226
00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:42,610
it today don't wait until tomorrow

227
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:44,860
you've got plenty of [ __ ] to do tomorrow

228
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:46,300
whatever you can do today do it or you

229
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:47,680
just keep adding [ __ ] up for tomorrow

230
00:08:46,299 --> 00:08:49,120
and then tomorrow never comes and then

231
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:50,769
one of these days you're gonna have a

232
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,029
big-ass list of [ __ ] that you never did

233
00:08:50,769 --> 00:08:54,189
you're gonna find problems and you're

234
00:08:52,029 --> 00:08:55,720
gonna in your grow and you're gonna know

235
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:56,560
why it's because you didn't do that list

236
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,360
of [ __ ] that you should have been

237
00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:59,379
keeping up on so try to stay on top of

238
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,480
your chores you guys that's what I'm

239
00:08:59,379 --> 00:09:02,799
saying so check your plants every day

240
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,000
you should be touching every single

241
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:05,469
plant you should be putting your eyes on

242
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,509
every single plant get in there and love

243
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:08,710
them so the second thing on my list here

244
00:09:07,509 --> 00:09:11,559
check to see if the plants

245
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:13,030
water you can check visually I can see

246
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:14,199
if the plants look droopy at all if

247
00:09:13,029 --> 00:09:15,759
they're starting to lean over if the

248
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:18,430
leaves are kind of hanging down they

249
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:20,889
need water or lift up the pot and check

250
00:09:18,429 --> 00:09:23,169
the weight the standard way to do this

251
00:09:20,889 --> 00:09:25,179
is think about it this way water your

252
00:09:23,169 --> 00:09:26,769
plant water until it's full freshly

253
00:09:25,179 --> 00:09:28,959
watered pick it up and see how much it

254
00:09:26,769 --> 00:09:31,090
weighs that's its full weight when it

255
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:32,590
weighs half of that it's ready to be

256
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:34,840
watered again you need to pour in water

257
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:36,990
and get it wet again so second thing

258
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:39,190
check to see if the plants need water

259
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:41,980
the third thing I would do every single

260
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:44,110
day pull any dead leaves and put them in

261
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:46,509
a trash bag or a trash can that gets

262
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:48,370
removed from the garden area I don't

263
00:09:46,509 --> 00:09:50,200
like to leave my trash bag or my trash

264
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:51,519
can in the garden that doesn't make

265
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:54,600
sense to me I want to get that out of

266
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:56,289
there um one of the reasons being I

267
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,340
apologize for all the coffee and

268
00:09:56,289 --> 00:09:59,439
cleaning over the throat that'll end

269
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:01,480
here pretty soon took a couple of fat

270
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:04,180
dabs ah the reason I like to get

271
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:06,430
yellowing leaves out of the room is buds

272
00:10:04,179 --> 00:10:08,019
are attracted to yellow leaves bugs see

273
00:10:06,429 --> 00:10:10,389
yellow leaves as a perfect opportunity

274
00:10:08,019 --> 00:10:12,159
the outer layer of the leaf has been

275
00:10:10,389 --> 00:10:13,809
softened and they can bite in and get to

276
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:15,909
the juicy insides of the leaves a little

277
00:10:13,809 --> 00:10:17,049
more easily and bugs know that so

278
00:10:15,909 --> 00:10:18,789
they're attracted to yellow leaves

279
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:20,979
that's why your sticky traps are yellow

280
00:10:18,789 --> 00:10:23,409
so get all the yellow leaves out of

281
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:24,879
there put them in a trash can put them

282
00:10:23,409 --> 00:10:26,319
in a trash bag and get them out of the

283
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:29,320
room because those are gonna attract

284
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,600
bugs so get that [ __ ] away from there

285
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:33,490
the next thing I would recommend check

286
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,930
the clones in the domes for moisture I

287
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:37,299
checked the humidity levels in your

288
00:10:34,929 --> 00:10:38,949
clones and check for roots and if you've

289
00:10:37,299 --> 00:10:40,629
got roots to transplant them put them

290
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:41,920
into the next uh if they're going into

291
00:10:40,629 --> 00:10:43,120
the next size Rock we'll put them into

292
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:44,889
there if they're going into cups with

293
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,179
soil throw them into there I think they

294
00:10:44,889 --> 00:10:48,519
got roots do whatever you need to do if

295
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:49,719
they need moisture or humidity adjust

296
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:51,490
that [ __ ] get in there and fix it you

297
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:53,980
can fix the clone domes really easily so

298
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:55,930
the next thing to do check the temps and

299
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:58,529
the humidity of the room and adjust that

300
00:10:55,929 --> 00:11:00,939
if necessary you guys try to aim for

301
00:10:58,529 --> 00:11:03,189
forty to sixty percent humidity during

302
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:05,080
your bloom phase and then during the veg

303
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:06,370
phase you can be around sixty to seventy

304
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:08,080
percent humidity I wouldn't go any

305
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:10,450
higher than seventy percent humidity and

306
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:13,389
trying to have some airflow along with

307
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:14,770
that or you will get some issues try to

308
00:11:13,389 --> 00:11:16,419
keep the daytime temperature around

309
00:11:14,769 --> 00:11:18,279
seventy to seventy seven degrees I

310
00:11:16,419 --> 00:11:20,649
really like 74 degrees plants really

311
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:22,149
like 70 for some of the sativa is like

312
00:11:20,649 --> 00:11:25,120
to get up to 77 during the

313
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:27,850
cycle during the night cycle try to stay

314
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,080
within 10 degrees of what your day cycle

315
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:32,019
is so if during the day you're getting

316
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:33,759
77 at night you want to be at 67 or a

317
00:11:32,019 --> 00:11:35,860
little higher don't go more than 10

318
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:39,639
degrees swing from day to night so

319
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:41,889
during the day 72 77 during the night 60

320
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:44,470
to 65 degrees during your night cycle is

321
00:11:41,889 --> 00:11:45,639
what I try to aim for another thing that

322
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,810
you need to do that a lot of people

323
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:49,059
forget to do and I can tell by your

324
00:11:46,809 --> 00:11:51,279
Instagram photos sweep the damn floor

325
00:11:49,059 --> 00:11:53,469
all you gotta do is get a broom and a

326
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:55,149
dustpan and a bucket and sweep the floor

327
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:56,590
scoop up that [ __ ] that you just swept

328
00:11:55,149 --> 00:11:58,419
up into a dustpan dump it into the

329
00:11:56,590 --> 00:12:00,910
bucket get it out of there and put it

330
00:11:58,419 --> 00:12:02,979
into a trash can and get it out of the

331
00:12:00,909 --> 00:12:04,299
house all that [ __ ] on the floor first

332
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:05,289
of all it looks terrible why do you want

333
00:12:04,299 --> 00:12:06,490
that [ __ ] on your floor in your grow

334
00:12:05,289 --> 00:12:08,769
room it looks like [ __ ] get the leaves

335
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:11,649
off there get the dirt off there get

336
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:12,909
that uh the UH I can't think of what

337
00:12:11,649 --> 00:12:14,829
that shit's called right now that white

338
00:12:12,909 --> 00:12:17,230
stuff that sucks the step on the perlite

339
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:18,520
get the perlite up off the floor ah just

340
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:20,740
sweep up you guys it's not that hard

341
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:22,480
every leaf on the floor every little

342
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:24,370
piece of debris that's a good spot for a

343
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,840
bug to hide if you've got a problem with

344
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:30,850
white flies fungus gnats spider mites a

345
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:32,740
fidex that's another spot for a bug to

346
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:35,320
hide one little tiny bug can hide under

347
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:37,930
a leaf and lay so many eggs don't give

348
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:39,430
him the opportunity you guys fight the

349
00:12:37,929 --> 00:12:41,319
battle at your advantage don't give

350
00:12:39,429 --> 00:12:42,549
these bugs a place to go so sweep the

351
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,900
floor ah

352
00:12:42,549 --> 00:12:46,089
the next thing I would do check any

353
00:12:43,899 --> 00:12:47,470
equipment check your hydro pumps Chuck

354
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:49,450
the EZ cloner pumps check your

355
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:51,250
dehumidifiers if you're running hydro

356
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:52,930
check your mix pump in your reservoir I

357
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:54,309
know a lot of guys have a big res filled

358
00:12:52,929 --> 00:12:55,750
with nutrients you just put a pump in

359
00:12:54,309 --> 00:12:57,250
there to shoot the nutrients around

360
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:59,590
check that pump make sure it hasn't

361
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:00,909
gotten clogged up those pumps have

362
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:03,370
little filters on them they like to get

363
00:13:00,909 --> 00:13:05,230
gunky if you're using any kind of feed

364
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:06,850
system check that thing make sure your

365
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:09,700
sprinklers haven't gotten clogged up if

366
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:12,310
you've got an EZ cloner check the water

367
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:14,410
level in that as well and refill it and

368
00:13:12,309 --> 00:13:16,000
adjust the pH ah

369
00:13:14,409 --> 00:13:18,069
so the next thing you should do check

370
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,340
the pH in ppm levels if you're running

371
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:22,870
any hydro if you've got a flood and

372
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:25,269
drain kit if you're doing buckets or

373
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:28,090
whatever check your pH also check your

374
00:13:25,269 --> 00:13:30,069
ppm you need to adjust your pH you need

375
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:32,560
to adjust your PPM's almost every day

376
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:34,990
I've seen large hydro Gardens need to be

377
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:35,709
topped off every day if not twice a day

378
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:38,049
because of

379
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:39,580
evaporation and plant productivity and

380
00:13:38,049 --> 00:13:41,589
every time that water evaporates and you

381
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:43,540
add more water you've got to adjust the

382
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:45,759
pH so check that [ __ ] out all the time

383
00:13:43,539 --> 00:13:47,139
every day if you can twice a day if you

384
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:48,909
can on that if you're running hydro

385
00:13:47,139 --> 00:13:50,470
hydro guys may have a little bit more

386
00:13:48,909 --> 00:13:52,029
work to do than our soil guys but we've

387
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:53,769
got a lot of soil and dirt to deal with

388
00:13:52,029 --> 00:13:55,839
so the work will kind of math out I

389
00:13:53,769 --> 00:13:57,850
guess I'm not sure I'm gonna run a real

390
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:59,019
hydro garden myself so I can't speak

391
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:00,220
correctly on that but it seems like you

392
00:13:59,019 --> 00:14:02,949
have a lot of cleaning and a lot of

393
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:03,490
maintenance to do on a hydro grill so

394
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:05,170
what's next

395
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:06,909
prune and train the plants and shape

396
00:14:05,169 --> 00:14:08,139
them the way you want them for your grow

397
00:14:06,909 --> 00:14:10,360
space that's something you can be

398
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:12,039
working on every single day keep in mind

399
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,659
how you want those plants to be shape if

400
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:16,029
the architecture correct so that you

401
00:14:13,659 --> 00:14:18,000
have sturdy plants try to use up as much

402
00:14:16,029 --> 00:14:20,289
canopy space as you can with each plant

403
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,419
so prune and train your plants take off

404
00:14:20,289 --> 00:14:23,740
all the shitty leaves take off any

405
00:14:22,419 --> 00:14:25,329
little sucker leaves that are happening

406
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:28,360
just get rid of that crap make the plant

407
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:31,180
cells alright excuse me

408
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:32,470
so the next step lollipop any small crap

409
00:14:31,179 --> 00:14:33,729
while you're in flower all those little

410
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:36,190
tiny buds that are happening on the

411
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:37,720
bottom just crap cut that crap off

412
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:39,520
you can Wally pop all the way up through

413
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,840
week four I've done it up into week five

414
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,909
once you get the hang of it you can

415
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:44,889
really get carried away you'll know what

416
00:14:42,909 --> 00:14:46,990
to cut off you'll know what to leave so

417
00:14:44,889 --> 00:14:48,159
when you're new at it only do it for the

418
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:49,600
first couple of weeks I guess until you

419
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:50,769
get the hang of it and then once you've

420
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,210
gotten a few crops under your belt that

421
00:14:50,769 --> 00:14:53,289
you've ollie popped you'll be able to do

422
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:54,910
it up in a week four or five without

423
00:14:53,289 --> 00:14:56,529
pissing the plants off I've done it too

424
00:14:54,909 --> 00:14:57,969
late and caused from aphrodite that's

425
00:14:56,529 --> 00:15:00,159
why I warn you to go light and then

426
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:01,750
learn how to do it so lollipop stuff

427
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:03,850
take off all that small crap and flower

428
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:06,039
pull off any funky leaves while you're

429
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:08,560
there so the next thing that you can do

430
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:11,799
every single day you guys take notes on

431
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:13,959
everything you do everything you do just

432
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:16,049
write down what you do I run a large

433
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:19,030
grove for green and healthy wellness

434
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:20,289
basically the owner of green and healthy

435
00:15:19,029 --> 00:15:22,569
wellness has put me in charge of the

436
00:15:20,289 --> 00:15:25,419
grow what I say goes he doesn't ask me

437
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:26,020
any questions as long as at the end of

438
00:15:25,419 --> 00:15:28,419
the harvest

439
00:15:26,019 --> 00:15:30,279
there's our goal weight of quality flour

440
00:15:28,419 --> 00:15:31,979
nobody's gonna [ __ ] with me and I'm

441
00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:34,860
gonna reach that goal

442
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:36,750
but the OCD person in me the person that

443
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:38,789
likes to be accountable I make notes of

444
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:40,710
everything I do all day every day if I

445
00:15:38,789 --> 00:15:42,750
open up my phone we could read exactly

446
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:44,370
what I did not exactly probably but I'm

447
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:46,409
pretty close to every step I did today

448
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:47,759
from walking in and checking the Clones

449
00:15:46,409 --> 00:15:50,129
walking the roads and checking each

450
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:51,899
plant fixing the sprinklers like I write

451
00:15:50,129 --> 00:15:53,250
down what I do every day just to keep

452
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:55,199
accountability and to keep myself

453
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:57,000
reminded of what's been done so that if

454
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,500
something goes wrong I can look back on

455
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
that and go oh look who's right here

456
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:03,419
when I makes this stupid [ __ ] together I

457
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:06,509
messed up also you guys a good reason to

458
00:16:03,419 --> 00:16:08,250
take notes this industry is expanding

459
00:16:06,509 --> 00:16:10,429
rapidly and we're gonna have marijuana

460
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:12,840
available in every state before too long

461
00:16:10,429 --> 00:16:14,489
when states start legalizing cannabis

462
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:16,680
and it's time to hire professional

463
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:18,810
growers you guys that took good notes of

464
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:22,199
all your grows you guys are gonna have a

465
00:16:18,809 --> 00:16:24,239
portfolio basically an application or a

466
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,710
resume right there on paper you can see

467
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,570
look I took notes so that shows that

468
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:28,769
you're organized it shows that you're

469
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:30,090
accountable it shows that you're

470
00:16:28,769 --> 00:16:32,490
planning it shows that you're thinking

471
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:33,780
it shows that you're serious all the

472
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:35,519
other guys are gonna be able to say well

473
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:36,929
I grew this much weed in my mom's

474
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:39,029
basement and they're not gonna have any

475
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:39,299
pictures or any notes or anything like

476
00:16:39,029 --> 00:16:40,559
that

477
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:42,779
so you guys are taking notes you're

478
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:44,549
gonna have the advantage there so take

479
00:16:42,779 --> 00:16:45,779
notes on everything you do I talked

480
00:16:44,549 --> 00:16:47,250
about that a lot but it's something that

481
00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:49,949
I think is really serious in a cannabis

482
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:50,789
grow what if you do something different

483
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:52,500
this time and it comes out perfect

484
00:16:50,789 --> 00:16:53,969
you're gonna want to know what you did

485
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,320
the only way you're dumb high ass is

486
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:56,850
gonna remember is if you wrote it down

487
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:58,620
cuz you're smoking too much good weed

488
00:16:56,850 --> 00:17:01,920
cuz you're growing too much good weed so

489
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:04,140
write [ __ ] down and that is my weekly or

490
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:05,789
my daily to-do checklist I'm now gonna

491
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:07,560
move on to weekly so this is stuff that

492
00:17:05,789 --> 00:17:09,480
you should be handling once a week I

493
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:10,919
like to pick Mondays and just kick

494
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:13,230
Monday's ass I get all the chores done

495
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:14,310
on Monday and then through the rest of

496
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:15,690
the week you can just focus on the

497
00:17:14,309 --> 00:17:17,789
plants and keeping everything clean and

498
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:19,289
doing all that stuff so every Monday

499
00:17:17,789 --> 00:17:21,659
this is what I would do I would start

500
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:24,000
each week with a well plan to feed in

501
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:26,370
each room if you've got a clone area if

502
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,319
they've got water in trays or in a

503
00:17:26,369 --> 00:17:30,359
cloner dump that water out put fresh

504
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:32,309
water in there fresh nutrients whatever

505
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:34,409
you're using if you're using a and B in

506
00:17:32,309 --> 00:17:36,119
the cloner or if you're using rapid

507
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:38,850
start or if you use a clone X whatever

508
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:40,679
put fresh solution in your clone er get

509
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:41,909
it going fresh on Monday or whatever day

510
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,350
you choose to start but once a week

511
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:45,600
clean that sucker out and get it going

512
00:17:43,349 --> 00:17:47,609
fresh also water all of your

513
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:50,099
vej plants feed your veg plants with a

514
00:17:47,609 --> 00:17:52,048
strong nutrient solution on Monday if

515
00:17:50,099 --> 00:17:53,639
their little babies maybe just some a

516
00:17:52,048 --> 00:17:55,109
and B if they're getting a little bigger

517
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,160
maybe throw a little liquid karma in

518
00:17:55,109 --> 00:17:57,928
there if they're getting even bigger

519
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,970
maybe they want some potassium silicates

520
00:17:57,929 --> 00:18:01,500
and maybe some cal-mag in there you

521
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:03,900
should definitely be feeding your veg

522
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:06,690
plants a little bit of ruin oculi also

523
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:09,210
get those roots going so also feed your

524
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:11,910
flowering plants a well-planned feed

525
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:13,679
each week if it's time to flush you need

526
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:15,570
to start flushing and that's another

527
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:17,640
good reason to take notes then you know

528
00:18:15,569 --> 00:18:19,710
when to flush if you guys need help

529
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:21,720
planning your feeding I did an episode

530
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:23,880
all about feeding your flowering plants

531
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:26,788
so episode number 69 will give you a

532
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:28,590
weekly planning a weekly schedule of

533
00:18:26,788 --> 00:18:29,609
what to feed your plants while they're

534
00:18:28,589 --> 00:18:32,579
in flowers so if you want to check that

535
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:34,649
out that may be useful for you so every

536
00:18:32,579 --> 00:18:36,869
week feed your plants a well feed a

537
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:38,669
well-planned feed ah the next thing I

538
00:18:36,869 --> 00:18:40,889
would do every week is dust all of the

539
00:18:38,669 --> 00:18:43,200
fans you guys those fans get dirty

540
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:44,460
I just dust the backs of them off if you

541
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,808
want to take off the screen and clean

542
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:47,880
the blades every week that would be

543
00:18:45,808 --> 00:18:49,529
super cool of you your room would

544
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:51,510
appreciate it all of that dust is going

545
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:53,700
to end up in your dabs if you don't

546
00:18:51,509 --> 00:18:54,538
clean the fan think of it that way the

547
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,538
next thing I would do

548
00:18:54,538 --> 00:18:59,369
check the timers for proper time and

549
00:18:56,538 --> 00:19:00,990
function be there when the lights come

550
00:18:59,369 --> 00:19:02,459
on a couple of times a week I know you

551
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:04,710
can't be there all the time when the

552
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:05,850
lights come on but if you can try to be

553
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:07,350
there if the lights come on at nine

554
00:19:05,849 --> 00:19:10,889
o'clock just be standing outside of the

555
00:19:07,349 --> 00:19:12,298
room like 857 so that when the lights

556
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:14,009
click on you can hear it go click and

557
00:19:12,298 --> 00:19:15,480
then you can open the door they can make

558
00:19:14,009 --> 00:19:17,460
sure the timer is working and then be

559
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:19,470
there again when the lights go off so

560
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:22,380
just check the timers for proper time

561
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:24,750
and proper function every week I would

562
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:25,980
calibrate your meters if you've got a pH

563
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:28,890
meter you should have one of those

564
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:30,870
calibrate it get the 4 the 7 and the 10

565
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:32,280
solution and just calibrate that thing

566
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:35,009
once a week if you're a small time

567
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:37,500
grower and you have a hydro short hydro

568
00:19:35,009 --> 00:19:39,298
store near you that you frequent they

569
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,890
will probably calibrate your pH meter

570
00:19:39,298 --> 00:19:43,769
for you they'll be nice and do that as a

571
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:46,530
courtesy so calibrate your pH meter you

572
00:19:43,769 --> 00:19:48,509
should also have a ppm meter calibrate

573
00:19:46,529 --> 00:19:50,099
that as frequently as you can at least

574
00:19:48,509 --> 00:19:51,569
once a week that can make a huge

575
00:19:50,099 --> 00:19:52,649
difference in the quality of your

576
00:19:51,569 --> 00:19:54,839
flowers if you're measuring something

577
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:57,870
and your meter is telling you that it's

578
00:19:54,839 --> 00:19:59,220
at 7 but it's actually at 5 and you're

579
00:19:57,869 --> 00:20:00,389
adjusting to get to 6 5

580
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:02,370
you're actually gonna be justing down

581
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:04,350
into the fours and you're really gonna

582
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:06,389
cause problems so calibrate your meters

583
00:20:04,349 --> 00:20:08,189
you guys the next thing I would do at

584
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:09,780
least once a week is check all your

585
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:11,490
blowers and fans and make sure that

586
00:20:09,779 --> 00:20:14,129
they're not clogged or restricted in any

587
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:15,690
way most of the time this you can be

588
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:17,370
done visually you can look around the

589
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:19,259
room and see that everything is working

590
00:20:17,369 --> 00:20:21,178
maybe put your hand if you've got a big

591
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:22,829
vortex blower just put your hand on the

592
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:24,900
outside of the vortex blower and feel it

593
00:20:22,829 --> 00:20:26,490
vibrate listen to it you'll know if some

594
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:28,559
shit's wrong but just pay attention to

595
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:30,538
that stuff if it's clogged up that could

596
00:20:28,558 --> 00:20:32,158
be a fire hazard if it's clogged up that

597
00:20:30,538 --> 00:20:33,629
is going to cost you electricity because

598
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:35,400
that fan is spinning and you're not

599
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:36,840
getting blowing out of it but you're

600
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,700
using electricity because it's spinning

601
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:40,079
and trying to break free from that hair

602
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:41,490
clog or whatever you've got in there

603
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:44,158
those leaves that are clogged in there

604
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:45,839
so just check those out guys before you

605
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,880
go sticking your fingers and any blowers

606
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:49,889
unplug them and give them a long time to

607
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:52,260
quit spinning they spin for a long time

608
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:54,120
and just the the natural force of those

609
00:20:52,259 --> 00:20:55,798
fans spinning on their own weight that's

610
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:57,329
enough to put a nice cut on your finger

611
00:20:55,798 --> 00:20:58,829
so watch your [ __ ] fingers those

612
00:20:57,329 --> 00:21:00,599
blowers I've cut myself on a blower

613
00:20:58,829 --> 00:21:03,119
before it sucks more than you would ever

614
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:04,349
know take it from me there's blood sweat

615
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:06,479
and tears in my garden and that's where

616
00:21:04,349 --> 00:21:08,038
the blood came from so the next thing

617
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,690
you guys visually check the ductwork and

618
00:21:08,038 --> 00:21:11,460
make sure that everything is sealed up

619
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:12,090
were blown a lot of pressure through

620
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,829
these ducts

621
00:21:12,089 --> 00:21:15,750
where the ducting connects to the lights

622
00:21:13,829 --> 00:21:17,548
where the ducting connects to the blower

623
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:19,319
where the ducting runs out of whatever

624
00:21:17,548 --> 00:21:22,048
room you're using just make sure that

625
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:23,788
all that stuff is sealed also clean your

626
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:25,470
air stones if you're making any kind of

627
00:21:23,788 --> 00:21:27,419
tees or running any hydro or if you've

628
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:28,710
got cloners with air stones or if you've

629
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:31,049
just got water sitting there to get

630
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:32,460
bubbled to get the chlorine out clean

631
00:21:31,048 --> 00:21:34,019
the air stones you guys those things get

632
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:35,400
murky sometimes you might just want to

633
00:21:34,019 --> 00:21:37,139
throw them away and replace them they

634
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,788
are not that expensive if you've got a

635
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:41,370
few bucks just go buy new ones

636
00:21:38,788 --> 00:21:44,548
the next thing clean your dehumidifier

637
00:21:41,369 --> 00:21:46,109
or humidifier filter in Colorado we

638
00:21:44,548 --> 00:21:49,048
probably don't even have a dehumidifier

639
00:21:46,109 --> 00:21:50,849
in most rooms we use a humidifier in

640
00:21:49,048 --> 00:21:53,069
some places but clean those filters they

641
00:21:50,849 --> 00:21:54,298
get funky that [ __ ] gets dirty anything

642
00:21:53,069 --> 00:21:55,889
that has water running through it

643
00:21:54,298 --> 00:21:58,168
frequently needs to be cleaned it'll get

644
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:59,880
gross just clean your [ __ ] if you're

645
00:21:58,169 --> 00:22:02,429
running hydro clean out your reservoir

646
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:04,860
every week to ten days and start with

647
00:22:02,429 --> 00:22:06,298
fresh water and fresh nutrients well

648
00:22:04,859 --> 00:22:08,519
like I keep saying water that sits

649
00:22:06,298 --> 00:22:10,200
around that gets old it gets gross shits

650
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:12,509
able to grow in there things can

651
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,930
colonize in there you don't want that

652
00:22:12,509 --> 00:22:14,609
you

653
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:16,860
fresh stuff if you're running easy

654
00:22:14,609 --> 00:22:18,419
cloners do the same flush out those easy

655
00:22:16,859 --> 00:22:19,949
cloners I talked about that a minute ago

656
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:22,620
just dump it out fill it with fresh

657
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:24,059
water fresh nutrients pH it and get it

658
00:22:22,619 --> 00:22:25,409
going all over again your plants will

659
00:22:24,059 --> 00:22:27,690
love you for it you don't want to drink

660
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:29,130
old funky water do you like you don't

661
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:30,570
even leave your dog's bowl sitting there

662
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:32,220
for too long without putting fresh water

663
00:22:30,569 --> 00:22:35,339
in it don't do that to your plants love

664
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:36,240
your plants they're family too so

665
00:22:35,339 --> 00:22:38,579
something you're gonna need to think

666
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,589
about weekly you need to you need to

667
00:22:38,579 --> 00:22:42,500
dispose of your grow room trash

668
00:22:40,589 --> 00:22:44,909
carefully when the trash man comes

669
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:46,740
you're gonna wanna I would wait until

670

671
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,289
you when you know he's coming don't

672
00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:51,539
leave that trash sitting out there on

673
00:22:49,289 --> 00:22:53,970
the curb overnight if it's out there on

674
00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:56,460
the curb your trash is accessible to the

675
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:59,130
public and it is legal for police

676
00:22:56,460 --> 00:23:01,289
officers neighborhood kids hungry

677
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:03,930
homeless people curious neighbors

678
00:23:01,289 --> 00:23:05,849
whoever private investigators anybody

679
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:07,560
can walk up to your trash and look

680
00:23:05,849 --> 00:23:09,119
through your [ __ ] and they can take it

681
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:10,619
if they want those guys stole my trash

682
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:11,609
yeah they can do that they really can't

683
00:23:10,619 --> 00:23:12,750
sir if you don't know what I'm talking

684
00:23:11,609 --> 00:23:15,359
about I apologize that was kind of

685
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:17,700
cheesy ah but your trash is fair game if

686
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:18,990
it's out there on the curb and if you've

687
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:20,640
got a whole bunch of leaves in there and

688
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:22,740
you live in a state that is not legal to

689
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,090
produce cannabis you could have a crime

690
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:26,009
that could be evidence of a crime right

691
00:23:24,089 --> 00:23:28,589
there so be careful dispose of your grow

692
00:23:26,009 --> 00:23:30,359
room trash very carefully if you're

693
00:23:28,589 --> 00:23:31,829
doing a large grow take it to the dump

694
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:33,599
yourself the guys at the dump don't give

695
00:23:31,829 --> 00:23:35,039
a [ __ ] just take it to the dump have it

696
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:36,119
in big trash bags just go drop it off

697
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:37,710
they don't care that you're dropping off

698
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:40,199
wheat leaves those guys have their own

699
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:41,940
business going on so uh dispose of your

700
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,740
grow room trash carefully another thing

701
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:45,690
I would recommend doing weekly look

702
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:48,059
around the grow room look on the walls

703
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:50,340
and the ceiling and the floors and look

704
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:52,589
for any mold or moisture if you've got

705
00:23:50,339 --> 00:23:54,599
condensation happening somewhere figure

706
00:23:52,589 --> 00:23:57,240
out why that's happening correct it if

707
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:58,740
you've got any mold I've seen blue mold

708
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:00,089
form on the walls and grow rooms I've

709
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:02,370
seen a little green mold form on the

710
00:24:00,089 --> 00:24:05,009
walls and grow rooms clean that [ __ ] up

711
00:24:02,369 --> 00:24:07,379
get rid of it use h2o to use bleach use

712
00:24:05,009 --> 00:24:09,299
peroxide use something strong if you

713
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:11,100
want to go organic do that do your thing

714
00:24:09,299 --> 00:24:12,960
but clean that [ __ ] up that is unhealthy

715
00:24:11,099 --> 00:24:14,909
for you it's unhealthy for the plants

716
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,920
figure out why it's happening and

717
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:18,090
resolve the issue to make it not happen

718
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,950
once you've cleaned that you've got to

719
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:21,209
figure out what caused it and stop it

720
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:24,000
from happening or it'll just come back

721
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:25,500
mold is a [ __ ] you can clean mold I saw

722
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,150
somebody clean mold off of a wall they

723
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,920
had a spot

724
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:30,140
this is about the size of a quarter

725
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:32,090
maybe a 50-cent piece and she scrubbed

726
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:33,140
the mold with bleach and hot water and

727
00:24:32,089 --> 00:24:34,159
she called me the next day and she's

728
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:36,020
like come over here I want you to see

729
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:38,690
this and I walked into Matt mold had

730
00:24:36,019 --> 00:24:41,480
formed into like a four by four square

731
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:42,769
it just grew that much in like 24 hours

732
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,839
it was so ridiculous so if you've got

733
00:24:42,769 --> 00:24:45,980
mold figure out what's causing it clean

734
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:48,500
the [ __ ] out of it you may need to call

735
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:51,829
a professional eventually don't ruin a

736
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:52,880
rental home growing weed god I apologize

737
00:24:51,829 --> 00:24:54,079
for clearing the throat so much in this

738
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,850
episode but I've got a whole bunch of

739
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:57,589
good dabs from the Terp station so I'll

740
00:24:55,849 --> 00:24:59,869
shut up the Terp acts you can blame all

741
00:24:57,589 --> 00:25:01,309
the throat clearing on Jordan that

742
00:24:59,869 --> 00:25:02,539
sounded grosser than it was meant to but

743
00:25:01,309 --> 00:25:04,579
there we go

744
00:25:02,539 --> 00:25:06,409
so that's everything that you should do

745
00:25:04,579 --> 00:25:08,089
in my opinion stuff you should do weekly

746
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:10,160
I'm gonna move on to things that you

747
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:12,409
should do monthly if you're running

748
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:14,240
hydro or if you have a feed system I

749
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:17,360
recommend that you clean the lines out

750
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:19,519
some way um who recommended it to me I

751
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:22,309
remember who said it Shane it was our

752
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:24,319
friend Shane Shane recommended that you

753
00:25:22,309 --> 00:25:26,509
use an air compressor to clean out the

754
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:28,429
lines of your hydro system to blow any

755
00:25:26,509 --> 00:25:30,890
clogs so if you've got a feed system

756
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:32,269
he's got a hydro system clean that [ __ ]

757
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:33,860
out if you've got little sprinklers

758
00:25:32,269 --> 00:25:36,650
clean those out if you've got rippers

759
00:25:33,859 --> 00:25:37,969
clean those out just you might have to

760
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:39,980
hand poke them you might have to get

761
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:41,990
something pokey then just hand poke each

762
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:43,490
little hole out by hand but you need

763
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:46,670
them clean so clean the [ __ ] out of

764
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:48,289
those monthly clean your air conditioner

765
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:51,590
filters that's something that needs to

766
00:25:48,289 --> 00:25:53,240
be done monthly also test your smoke

767
00:25:51,589 --> 00:25:55,339
detectors you should have smoke

768
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:56,900
detectors in your grow rooms yes you

769
00:25:55,339 --> 00:25:58,970
don't want that [ __ ] burning down if it

770
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:01,340
catches on fire you want a heads up so

771
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:02,779
test your smoke detectors replace the

772
00:26:01,339 --> 00:26:04,879
battery if necessary that should be

773
00:26:02,779 --> 00:26:07,160
obvious there's nothing like hearing

774
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:09,740
beep beep all the time when you're

775
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:10,910
growing and batteries trying to die it's

776
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:12,890
the worst sound ever I don't know how

777
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:14,330
anyone can live with that another thing

778
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:16,940
you should do every month clean the

779
00:26:14,329 --> 00:26:18,949
glass in your reflectors you guys this

780
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:20,750
may need to be done more or less often

781
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:22,279
depending on your style if you're

782
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:24,650
spraying and there if you're using a

783
00:26:22,279 --> 00:26:26,420
foliar spray that shit's gonna probably

784
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:28,220
end up a little bit on the reflectors

785
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:29,720
unless you're careful if you're spraying

786
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:32,000
bug sprays it's gonna end up on the

787
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:34,519
light reflectors clean that glass just

788
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,230
clean it out if you can slide the glass

789
00:26:34,519 --> 00:26:37,490
out clean the inside sometimes your

790
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:40,009
carbon filter blows a little bit of

791
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:42,349
carbon in there just clean that stuff up

792
00:26:40,009 --> 00:26:44,119
you're paying for the light to shine

793
00:26:42,349 --> 00:26:46,009
it's taking electricity the light is

794
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:47,869
shining don't put a dirty lens between

795
00:26:46,009 --> 00:26:49,759
the light and the plants that you're

796
00:26:47,869 --> 00:26:51,769
trying to put the light on it just makes

797
00:26:49,759 --> 00:26:53,390
more sense to clean it you're paying

798
00:26:51,769 --> 00:26:54,410
full price no matter what you do so

799
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:55,910
clean that [ __ ]

800
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:57,169
and speaking of paying full price the

801
00:26:55,910 --> 00:27:00,320
next step these may sound like no

802
00:26:57,169 --> 00:27:02,900
brainers but pay your electricity and

803
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:04,279
water bills every month you guys you

804
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:05,630
should be okay running a whole bunch of

805
00:27:04,279 --> 00:27:07,190
electricity and use it a whole bunch of

806
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:08,390
water but the first time you miss a bill

807
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:09,410
they're gonna come [ __ ] with you they're

808
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:10,850
gonna knock on your door they're gonna

809
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:12,620
want their money and that's when [ __ ]

810
00:27:10,849 --> 00:27:14,199
can go wrong so pay your bills don't

811
00:27:12,619 --> 00:27:16,668
ever try to ditch out on a grow bill

812
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:18,860
don't ever steal electricity don't ever

813
00:27:16,669 --> 00:27:20,270
steal water just pay your bills should

814
00:27:18,859 --> 00:27:21,439
be a no-brainer most of the people who

815
00:27:20,269 --> 00:27:23,960
listen to this show should already be

816
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,460
doing that but don't ever steal if you

817
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:28,100
do get caught stealing electricity or

818
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:29,539
water the government I think here I was

819
00:27:28,099 --> 00:27:32,629
told that they're able to charge you

820
00:27:29,539 --> 00:27:34,069
threefold for what you use so if you use

821
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:35,450
a hundred dollars in electricity and you

822
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:37,789
get caught stealing it they can charge

823
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:39,410
you 300 dollars just because you stole

824
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:41,720
it so pay up front don't be a dick it's

825
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:43,100
well worth it all right that's my stuff

826
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:45,319
you should do monthly I'm gonna move

827
00:27:43,099 --> 00:27:47,509
into things that you should do every

828
00:27:45,319 --> 00:27:49,399
harvest every harvest you're going to

829
00:27:47,509 --> 00:27:51,859
need to dispose of your sticks and

830
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:53,090
leaves that you have leftover there's

831
00:27:51,859 --> 00:27:55,039
gonna be a bunch of sticks and a bunch

832
00:27:53,089 --> 00:27:56,449
of leaves and a bunch of trim I'm not

833
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:57,740
the small trim you want to make a shout

834
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:59,690
of that but like a bunch of trim crap

835
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:01,279
that you don't want laying around you

836
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:02,990
need to get rid of that like I said

837
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:04,399
don't go throw-in that in the trash and

838
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:06,048
just leaving it out there you might want

839
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:07,790
to wait for the trash guy to come you

840
00:28:06,048 --> 00:28:09,319
might want to find a friend who has a

841
00:28:07,789 --> 00:28:10,879
construction site and get permission to

842
00:28:09,319 --> 00:28:12,649
throw your trash in there don't go using

843
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,480
someone's dumpster because if you get

844
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:15,980
caught doing that bill that's a fine for

845
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,179
throwing your trash into somebody else's

846
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:19,069
[ __ ] and then they'll want to see what

847
00:28:17,179 --> 00:28:20,720
you threw in there and then this cops

848
00:28:19,069 --> 00:28:22,428
looking at you and your big-ass bag of

849
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,679
weed leaves and then you're trying to

850
00:28:22,429 --> 00:28:27,530
figure out a story so figure out a

851
00:28:24,679 --> 00:28:29,590
clever way a safe way a smart way to get

852
00:28:27,529 --> 00:28:32,808
rid of all your sticks and leaves also

853
00:28:29,589 --> 00:28:35,449
dispose of or compost or recycle all of

854
00:28:32,808 --> 00:28:36,829
your soil carefully you don't want to be

855
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:39,200
in the backyard dumping out your old

856
00:28:36,829 --> 00:28:40,369
pots and then your backyard ends up full

857
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,169
of perlite and it's all white and

858
00:28:40,369 --> 00:28:43,819
speckly and the dirt doesn't look right

859
00:28:42,169 --> 00:28:45,730
you can't be that guy so you have to

860
00:28:43,819 --> 00:28:48,460
figure out a way to either dispose of or

861
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:50,779
recycle all of that soil that you use

862
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:51,950
recycling soil isn't as hard as you

863
00:28:50,779 --> 00:28:53,190
would imagine it just needs to be

864
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:55,049
remanded and kind of stir

865
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:57,390
and then you can definitely use that

866
00:28:55,049 --> 00:28:58,889
soil again so I figure out a way to do

867
00:28:57,390 --> 00:29:00,660
that I've done a little bit of talking

868
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:02,730
about that on the show I'm still

869
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:04,320
experimenting it with it myself so once

870
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:06,329
I get good at it I'll do a full episode

871
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:08,519
on recycling soil I made a little note

872
00:29:06,329 --> 00:29:11,399
about that so you're gonna have to learn

873
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:12,930
how to get rid of a bunch of dirt you're

874
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:14,430
gonna have sticks and stuff get rid of

875
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:16,200
that you're also if you're running hydro

876
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:19,410
you're gonna have rock wool cubes or

877
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:20,940
you're gonna have those hydroton clay

878
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:22,170
pellets I hate those things

879
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:24,180
you're gonna have to get rid of that

880
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:26,610
[ __ ] too somehow I'm pretty sure you can

881
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:28,710
recycle the rock wool cubes the hydrogen

882
00:29:26,609 --> 00:29:30,359
pellets you can rinse them off and use

883
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:31,470
them again E and clean them but

884
00:29:30,359 --> 00:29:33,389
eventually you got to throw those away

885
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:35,850
because they get funky so don't just go

886
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:37,380
throw don't go throwing those into your

887
00:29:35,849 --> 00:29:40,439
trash make sure you get rid of those

888
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:43,170
safely and smartly smartly a word I

889
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:44,640
think so it is now also cleaner pots you

890
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:47,100
guys every harvest you should clean your

891
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:49,440
pots you should also clean your hydro

892
00:29:47,099 --> 00:29:51,539
trays if you've got a 4x4 botanic care

893
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,680
tray or one of those 4x8 trays you

894
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:53,730
should clean those things you're gonna

895
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:55,650
think I'm crazy but here's how I

896
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:57,000
recommend you do it I throw in the truck

897
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:58,890
and just take them right to the car wash

898
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,740
and just line the pots up against the

899
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:03,240
wall and just spray the [ __ ] out of them

900
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:04,710
it's Colorado here everybody knows what

901
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:06,690
you're doing just go spray your [ __ ]

902
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:07,740
down nobody cares the hydro trays lean

903
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:09,269
it up against the side of the truck

904
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:11,009
spray the [ __ ] out of it throw in the

905
00:30:09,269 --> 00:30:12,299
back of the truck take it home if you're

906
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:14,339
in another state that may be kind of

907
00:30:12,299 --> 00:30:15,450
weird but if cannabis is legal just take

908
00:30:14,339 --> 00:30:17,039
them to the car wash and hose them down

909
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:19,170
don't use any soap don't use the car

910
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:20,250
washing soap don't wax them just use hot

911
00:30:19,170 --> 00:30:21,779
water on them with the high-pressure

912
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:24,660
thing just spray the [ __ ] out of them it

913
00:30:21,779 --> 00:30:26,940
works really well so once you got your

914
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:29,009
pots cleaned I recommend you clean the

915
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:31,440
room thoroughly from top to bottom I

916
00:30:29,009 --> 00:30:33,779
said earlier use h2o to use bleach use

917
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:35,070
hydrogen peroxide there are a thousand

918
00:30:33,779 --> 00:30:36,599
other products I could say to use but

919
00:30:35,069 --> 00:30:38,369
use something to get in there and

920
00:30:36,599 --> 00:30:41,250
sanitize the room don't just clean it up

921
00:30:38,369 --> 00:30:42,659
sanitize it our good friend Mike helps

922
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:45,059
me out when it's time to clean the room

923
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:47,400
Mike and I dress up in our little let's

924
00:30:45,059 --> 00:30:49,769
get clean suits it's basically just our

925
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:51,720
shittiest clothes we have put bandanas

926
00:30:49,769 --> 00:30:53,759
on our faces put our hair and crazy hats

927
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:55,380
go down in there and just clean

928
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:57,420
everything and by the time we're done

929
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:59,100
you can eat off the floor of my grow

930
00:30:57,420 --> 00:31:01,230
rooms when they're freshly started it is

931
00:30:59,099 --> 00:31:02,359
so gorgeous in there since I'm talking

932
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:05,759
about Mike I only give him a shout out

933
00:31:02,359 --> 00:31:06,959
we recorded a podcast last night and the

934
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:08,339
recording sounded like

935
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,419
[ __ ] something went wrong in the

936
00:31:08,339 --> 00:31:12,240
recording software and everything

937
00:31:09,419 --> 00:31:14,580
sounded like robots sound like r2d2 and

938
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:17,308
Darth Vader and b8 having conversations

939

so thanks for coming and let's get back

946
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:32,130
into the show sanitize your room every

947
00:31:30,298 --> 00:31:33,720
harvest that's what I was saying I also

948
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:36,120
clean the floors and the walls in the

949
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:39,419
ceiling you guys wipe them down scrub

950
00:31:36,119 --> 00:31:41,219
them down the ceiling gets funky you're

951
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:42,720
in there that's you it's humid you're in

952
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:45,120
there spraying pesticides are in there

953
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,798
Spring foliar sprays so that puts

954
00:31:45,119 --> 00:31:49,379
moisture everywhere then it gets humid

955
00:31:46,798 --> 00:31:51,269
water rises the ceiling is gonna get

956
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:52,980
funkier then you're gonna assume so just

957
00:31:51,269 --> 00:31:54,538
scrub it you'll think it's clean you'll

958
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:57,419
hit it with the rag and you realize it

959
00:31:54,538 --> 00:31:58,859
is not clean the walls obviously same

960
00:31:57,419 --> 00:32:00,270
thing with the foliar spray same thing

961
00:31:58,859 --> 00:32:01,709
with the humidity and the floors

962
00:32:00,269 --> 00:32:03,778
everything lands on the floor you

963
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:06,259
spilled nutrients there even walk in

964
00:32:03,778 --> 00:32:08,880
there it's just filthy clean mat [ __ ]

965
00:32:06,259 --> 00:32:10,769
also inspect any seals you've made if

966
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,480
you've sealed up any windows or doors or

967
00:32:10,769 --> 00:32:14,220
anything like that if you've put

968
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:17,190
caulking somewhere recaulk it if you've

969
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:20,308
taped it retaping also if you've put up

970
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:21,990
I put up hepa filters so if I've got a

971
00:32:20,308 --> 00:32:24,210
wall between two rooms and I'm pulling

972
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:25,589
air from one room to the other I just go

973
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:27,149
to Lowe's and buy those little square

974
00:32:25,589 --> 00:32:28,769
hepa filters and I just cut them kind of

975
00:32:27,148 --> 00:32:31,709
close to the shape I want just staple

976
00:32:28,769 --> 00:32:33,750
them to the wall I replace those every

977
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:36,269
time every harvest also I try to because

978
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:37,589
they get dusty they get dirty but they

979
00:32:36,269 --> 00:32:39,629
keep all the funk out of the room so

980
00:32:37,589 --> 00:32:41,970
just go ahead and replace those that's

981
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:43,260
always a good idea just those little

982
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:45,450
square hepa filters you can find them at

983
00:32:43,259 --> 00:32:47,819
lowe's if you can't find those just use

984
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:48,960
like a any kind of filter will work for

985
00:32:47,819 --> 00:32:50,730
it's just better than having the hole

986
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,929
where the air is moving open you just

987
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:53,849
want to put a filter over there to catch

988
00:32:51,929 --> 00:32:55,380
the dirt or any bugs or anything that

989
00:32:53,849 --> 00:32:56,369
may be trying to move around trying to

990
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:59,429
migrate from place to place

991
00:32:56,369 --> 00:33:01,558
alright so yearly here are a couple of

992
00:32:59,429 --> 00:33:04,350
things that I think you should do every

993
00:33:01,558 --> 00:33:06,599
single year as a grower oh I forgot to

994
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:07,980
mention every harvest um that little

995
00:33:06,599 --> 00:33:10,079
sleeve that goes around your carbon

996
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:12,329
filter take that off and clean it and

997
00:33:10,079 --> 00:33:13,648
put it back on and good luck not getting

998
00:33:12,329 --> 00:33:15,000
carbon everywhere the next time you turn

999
00:33:13,648 --> 00:33:17,459
on your carbon filter there are tons of

1000
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,898
tricks on that here's what I'm talking

1001
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:21,069
about when you use a carbon filter every

1002
00:33:18,898 --> 00:33:22,778
time you move it you jar the carbon and

1003
00:33:21,069 --> 00:33:24,519
and then you put a blower on there you

1004
00:33:22,778 --> 00:33:26,440
plug in the blower to start blowing the

1005
00:33:24,519 --> 00:33:27,879
air through the filter just to use it

1006
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:29,500
and then all that carbon you've just

1007
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:32,919
stirred goes flying through all of your

1008
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:34,659
lights and into your grow room you've

1009
00:33:32,919 --> 00:33:36,730
got to get you got to figure out a smart

1010
00:33:34,659 --> 00:33:40,240
way to catch that carbon what I do is I

1011
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:41,500
blow it into a I've got a it's a what is

1012
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:43,240
it I know what it is I can't think of

1013
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:44,859
the Brants a Crown Royal bag because the

1014
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:46,269
Crown Royal bag will let the air out but

1015
00:33:44,859 --> 00:33:48,398
it'll catch all of the particulate

1016
00:33:46,269 --> 00:33:49,960
that's coming through so I just put the

1017
00:33:48,398 --> 00:33:51,339
ducting into a Crown Royal bag and hold

1018
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:52,929
it and plug it in and it blows into

1019
00:33:51,339 --> 00:33:54,369
there for a couple seconds and then I

1020
00:33:52,929 --> 00:33:55,778
just pull that off and seal it up and

1021
00:33:54,369 --> 00:33:58,209
I've caught all the carbon in there so

1022
00:33:55,778 --> 00:33:59,950
that's a trick a really weird random

1023
00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:02,048
trick to keep all the carbon from

1024
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:03,340
blowing out when you got a new carbon

1025
00:34:02,048 --> 00:34:05,048
filter so take that little cover off you

1026
00:34:03,339 --> 00:34:06,879
guys it comes with the sleeve take that

1027
00:34:05,048 --> 00:34:08,230
off clean it it looks like [ __ ] when

1028
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,789
it's all dusty anyway you want that

1029
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:11,710
white and clean clean it up put some

1030
00:34:09,789 --> 00:34:14,019
OxiClean in the water get that sucker

1031
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:16,599
wide again so yearly here's where we are

1032
00:34:14,019 --> 00:34:18,190
yearly replace your carbon filter the

1033
00:34:16,599 --> 00:34:19,480
guy at the hydro shop swears to me that

1034
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:22,869
my carbon filters are gonna last two

1035
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:25,179
years they do not um there was a guy

1036
00:34:22,869 --> 00:34:26,950
replacing I what's it called a

1037
00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:29,500
transformer in my backyard a couple of

1038
00:34:26,949 --> 00:34:31,269
weeks ago and he told me sir smells like

1039
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:33,579
you got a skunk back here there were no

1040
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:35,230
skunks back there that was a little bit

1041
00:34:33,579 --> 00:34:36,639
of grateful dog crossed a space clean

1042
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:37,990
and it was sneaking up the whole

1043
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:39,700
neighborhood because my carbon filter

1044
00:34:37,989 --> 00:34:42,189
needed to be replaced I've got a new one

1045
00:34:39,699 --> 00:34:43,750
sitting there now as soon as I rebuild

1046
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:45,250
the room I'll have a fresh filter the

1047
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:47,469
neighbours will quit smelling the candy

1048
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:48,989
scented skunks so replace your carbon

1049
00:34:47,469 --> 00:34:50,980
filter they only last about a year

1050
00:34:48,989 --> 00:34:53,079
another thing that you should do every

1051
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:56,019
year you guys have your fire

1052
00:34:53,079 --> 00:34:58,480
extinguisher checked and replaced or

1053
00:34:56,019 --> 00:35:00,608
charged they've got a little red yellow

1054
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:02,469
and green gauge on them you want it all

1055
00:35:00,608 --> 00:35:04,239
the way in the green if it starts to get

1056
00:35:02,469 --> 00:35:05,500
too yellow it's not reliable anymore and

1057
00:35:04,239 --> 00:35:06,939
you need a new fire extinguisher you

1058
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:08,559
neither you either need to go get it

1059
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:09,639
charged or just buy a new one they sell

1060
00:35:08,559 --> 00:35:11,799
them at Lowe's they sell them at Home

1061
00:35:09,639 --> 00:35:13,569
Depot they're not expensive there

1062
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:15,099
hopefully you never need it I really

1063
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:17,170
hope you never need it but if you do you

1064
00:35:15,099 --> 00:35:19,390
want it fully charged I always have a

1065
00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:21,400
fire extinguisher near your Dro I've got

1066
00:35:19,389 --> 00:35:23,650
one I've got a veg room I've got a

1067
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:25,300
flowering room there's a fire

1068
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:27,099
extinguisher hanging on the outside of

1069
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:28,690
my flowering room have it on the outside

1070
00:35:27,099 --> 00:35:30,580
if something goes if you hear that smoke

1071
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:32,139
alarm and they're going off grab the

1072
00:35:30,579 --> 00:35:34,150
fire extinguisher check the door for

1073
00:35:32,139 --> 00:35:34,539
heat if it's stupid hot you have a

1074
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:35,829
decision

1075
00:35:34,539 --> 00:35:38,440
to make do you want to open that door or

1076
00:35:35,829 --> 00:35:39,519
not open that door hit that [ __ ] with

1077
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,599
the fire extinguisher that you've

1078
00:35:39,519 --> 00:35:41,619
already got in your hand you don't want

1079
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:43,389
to open the door and run in there and

1080
00:35:41,619 --> 00:35:45,549
find the fire extinguisher in the smoky

1081
00:35:43,389 --> 00:35:47,409
hot fiery room so have it on the outside

1082
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:48,910
and I really I prayed a job that you

1083
00:35:47,409 --> 00:35:50,489
never have to use your fire extinguisher

1084
00:35:48,909 --> 00:35:54,369
but I'd rather you have it and it work

1085
00:35:50,489 --> 00:35:55,779
and I'd rather you be safe then this

1086
00:35:54,369 --> 00:35:58,239
thing fail on you so I've got another

1087
00:35:55,780 --> 00:36:00,160
fire extinguisher right just outside the

1088
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:01,569
bedroom also just that's where [ __ ] can

1089
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:03,190
go wrong there are a lot of why it's a

1090
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:04,990
lot of electricity just want to be a

1091
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:07,570
responsible grower try to be responsible

1092
00:36:04,989 --> 00:36:10,659
so get your fire extinguisher inspected

1093
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:12,700
and replaced once a year and I think

1094
00:36:10,659 --> 00:36:14,679
that's all I've got for the checklist

1095
00:36:12,699 --> 00:36:17,079
you guys I really want to thank all my

1096
00:36:14,679 --> 00:36:18,819
friends on Facebook I posted to Facebook

1097
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:20,559
asking for some updates and a lot of

1098
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:21,820
people contributed so many of you that

1099
00:36:20,559 --> 00:36:23,230
I'm not even gonna try to list everybody

1100
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:25,600
so shout out to my facebook community

1101
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:27,250
that helped out I truly appreciate that

1102
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:29,039
there are some things I did leave out I

1103
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:31,420
understand that things got left out here

1104
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:32,860
you'll need to work on a pest management

1105
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:35,289
system you'll need to integrate that

1106
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:37,300
into this checklist somehow if you don't

1107
00:36:35,289 --> 00:36:39,429
see any issues you can simply spray once

1108
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:42,400
a week with an organic application

1109
00:36:39,429 --> 00:36:44,109
whatever you want to use I use as a max

1110
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,700
if there's no problems I just use it

1111
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:47,140
like since I travel from so many Gardens

1112
00:36:45,699 --> 00:36:48,730
I hit my plants once a week with that as

1113
00:36:47,139 --> 00:36:50,019
a max when they're in veg just to make

1114
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:52,059
sure that I don't bring anything home

1115
00:36:50,019 --> 00:36:53,559
from all the other Gardens I play in if

1116
00:36:52,059 --> 00:36:55,750
you see any issues in your garden you

1117
00:36:53,559 --> 00:36:57,880
may need to increase the frequency and

1118
00:36:55,750 --> 00:37:00,340
the potency of whatever you're spraying

1119
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:01,740
maybe change the active ingredient to of

1120
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:03,640
something a little bit stronger

1121
00:37:01,739 --> 00:37:05,109
hopefully you don't get any pests if

1122
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:06,159
you're doing something preventative but

1123
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:09,099
that's something you'll have to work

1124
00:37:06,159 --> 00:37:10,779
into this regimen here as well there's

1125
00:37:09,099 --> 00:37:12,219
also gonna be a point in time where

1126
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:14,530
you're going to need to change your

1127
00:37:12,219 --> 00:37:16,239
lightbulbs we did another episode on

1128
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:18,519
that every bulb is different every

1129
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:21,039
garden is different we talked about

1130
00:37:18,519 --> 00:37:23,829
swapping out your thousand watt HPS

1131
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:25,509
bulbs about every one two three harvests

1132
00:37:23,829 --> 00:37:27,309
I've heard people using them for a full

1133
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:29,500
year I've heard people using them for a

1134
00:37:27,309 --> 00:37:31,929
while it's like I said earlier when your

1135
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:33,610
bulbs start diminishing your eyes won't

1136
00:37:31,929 --> 00:37:35,799
notice it but your plants will and

1137
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:37,120
you're still paying for all of the

1138
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:39,160
electricity if you've got a thousand

1139
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:41,289
watt bulb and it's like six months old

1140
00:37:39,159 --> 00:37:42,849
it's probably only putting out 60 to 70

1141
00:37:41,289 --> 00:37:45,489
percent of its output but you're paying

1142
00:37:42,849 --> 00:37:47,769
for one hundred percent of that thousand

1143
00:37:45,489 --> 00:37:48,368
wants to be running so go upgrade your

1144
00:37:47,769 --> 00:37:50,440
bulbs it

1145
00:37:48,369 --> 00:37:52,059
it cost that much money if you think

1146
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:54,190
about how how much herb you're gonna

1147
00:37:52,059 --> 00:37:56,528
grow from a fresh bulb the difference

1148
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:58,298
the cost of that bulb should definitely

1149
00:37:56,528 --> 00:38:00,338
be worth it so that's what I've got for

1150
00:37:58,298 --> 00:38:02,259

I really can't do this justice if I

1179
00:38:53,798 --> 00:38:58,239
destroy if I try to describe it with

1180
00:38:55,268 --> 00:39:00,399
words on a microphone it's five disc

1181
00:38:58,239 --> 00:39:03,249
perks stacked on top of each other and

1182
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:05,079
they are welded together with what's

1183
00:39:03,248 --> 00:39:07,988
called a Jesus seal there are three

1184
00:39:05,079 --> 00:39:11,559
Jesus seals holding each perk together

1185
00:39:07,989 --> 00:39:13,210
the disks are actually donuts and there

1186
00:39:11,559 --> 00:39:15,789
is a tube that goes down the middle and

1187
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:17,470
it's got a hammer head so there's a down

00:39:15,789 --> 00:39:19,749
stem that goes into the rig it's got a

1189
00:39:17,469 --> 00:39:22,419
hammer head perk when you smoke through

1190
00:39:19,748 --> 00:39:25,058
it the water goes up through each disc

1191
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:26,858
and then it goes to the top disc where

1192
00:39:25,059 --> 00:39:29,109
there is a drain that goes down back to

1193

appreciate it if you're curious where

1239
00:40:48,909 --> 00:40:52,480
your contribution goes it goes to paying

1240
00:40:50,889 --> 00:40:54,098
for the hosting of my website it goes

1241
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,480
for things like new microphone covers I

1242
00:40:54,099 --> 00:40:56,680
try to have microphone covers for the

1243
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:58,989
guests because they do this kind of

1244
00:40:56,679 --> 00:40:59,889
stuff here that they rub their faces all

1245
00:40:58,989 --> 00:41:01,420
over the microphones when they're

1246
00:40:59,889 --> 00:41:02,768
talking because they're new so I try to

1247
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:04,389
have a cover for each guess if they

1248
00:41:02,768 --> 00:41:06,459
don't have to go rub in their face on

1249
00:41:04,389 --> 00:41:08,768
another person's mic cover I just think

1250
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:10,960
that that's gross water bottles for all

1251
00:41:08,768 --> 00:41:12,939
of the guests but mostly it goes to

1252
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:14,710
covering the Bluehost

1253
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:16,179
website which is where I host or the

1254
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:17,710
Bluehost hosting fee which is where I

1255
00:41:16,179 --> 00:41:19,778
have my website which is where I host

1256
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:21,519
this show there's a hundred and thirteen

1257
00:41:19,778 --> 00:41:23,199
episodes up there so it does take a

1258
00:41:21,518 --> 00:41:24,248
little bit of bandwidth anyway I'm just

1259
00:41:23,199 --> 00:41:25,748
letting you know where that goes I'm not

1260
00:41:24,248 --> 00:41:27,639
