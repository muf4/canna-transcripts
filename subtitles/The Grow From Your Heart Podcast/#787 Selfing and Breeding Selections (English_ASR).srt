all right here we go I'm your host my

3
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:28,559
friends call me Rasta Jeff this is

4
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:30,839
episode 787 of the grow from your heart

5
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:32,579
podcast I've got a fun episode planned

6
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:34,140
we're going to talk about breeding later

7
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:36,058
in the episode I will give away a pack

8
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,500
of seeds let's jump right into the

9
00:00:36,058 --> 00:00:39,359
breeding talk I do have a great email

10
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,280
here that came from our friend Jason

11
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:43,679
let's not waste too much time the email

12
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,719
goes a lot like this it says hey Ross to

13
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:48,000
Jeff my name is Jason I'm from Northern

14
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:49,679
Colorado nice to meet you bro it says I

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,899

to keep up the good fight bro can't stop

17
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:56,039
won't stop it goes on it says I'm a big

18
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:57,899
fan here and I really rely on your

19
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:00,420
information as far as breeding and

20
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:02,520
selections go ah thank you that's a huge

21
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,198
compliment knowing that you you uh rely

22
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,640
on my breeding you respect and trust my

23
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:07,079
guidance thank you that means a lot to

24
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,299
me so big up and fist bump and thanks

25
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:11,280
for that it does continue it says I'm

26
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:13,979
currently about to start a breeding run

27
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,019
which I am super excited about but I'm

28
00:01:13,978 --> 00:01:18,599
not sure how to select which female to

29
00:01:16,019 --> 00:01:20,938
select to spray and reverse so our

30
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:22,739
friend uh Jason has a breeding project

31
00:01:20,938 --> 00:01:24,419
in mind they want to make some feminized

32
00:01:22,739 --> 00:01:26,459
seeds they've got two plants but they

33
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:28,079
cannot decide which one of those two

34
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:30,359
female plants they should reverse to

35
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:32,759
turn into a pollen donor let's dig more

36
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:34,739
into this it says I have plant a that

37
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:37,859
checks all of the boxes to what we like

38
00:01:34,739 --> 00:01:39,899
but it lacks Terps but it is highly

39
00:01:37,859 --> 00:01:41,340
potent so we've got a plant that checks

40
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,978
all of the boxes it is a perfect

41
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,900
breeding plant it's a perfect female

42
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:47,578
except for the fact that it lacks Terps

43
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:49,618
however this plant is highly potent

44
00:01:47,578 --> 00:01:51,179
which kind of sometimes may make up for

45
00:01:49,618 --> 00:01:53,280
that lack of Terps we've got a highly

46
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:55,618
potent plant that checks all of the

47
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,500
boxes but it lacks terpenes so then it

48
00:01:55,618 --> 00:02:01,078
goes on it says plant B is not as potent

49
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:04,319
but has a sweet grapefruit Kush flavor

50
00:02:01,078 --> 00:02:06,239
that is Dynomite so this plant isn't as

51
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:08,159
potent it lacks the potency but it's got

52
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:10,258
that flavor that they're looking for it

53
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:12,000
says a sweet grapefruit Kush flavor

54
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:14,579
which sounds quite delightful in my

55
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,860
opinion that uh astringent uh bitter

56
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:18,660
almost citrusy grapefruit with some kush

57
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:20,220
on top of it to Mellow it out sounds

58
00:02:18,659 --> 00:02:21,479
like a great flavor in my mind that

59
00:02:20,219 --> 00:02:23,520
makes me think it's going to have a

60
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:25,019
great Buzz as well so that sounds like a

61
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,819
great idea we've got the flavor there

62
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:29,040
we've got the aroma there and it's

63
00:02:26,818 --> 00:02:31,439
dynamite it says this plant just doesn't

64
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:33,900
give me as medicated properly like plant

65
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:36,419
a does I want to breed with a purpose

66
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:38,879
and add those Terps to the potent plant

67
00:02:36,419 --> 00:02:41,518
so which plant would be the best to

68
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:42,959
spray with the STS and use the feminized

69
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,400
pollen from which is a very good

70
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,800
question I've got a couple of solid

71
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,959
answers for you it says I'm not sure if

72
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,459
I use the terpy plant as a pollen donor

73
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,739
since it's what I'm after essentially

74
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:54,180
please elaborate I hope this makes sense

75
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:56,400
it makes great sense brother this makes

76
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:58,439
a lot of good sense says thank you for

77
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,060
your reply it would be appreciated much

78
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:02,219
love from your neighbors up north and

79
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:03,539
you can use my name on the show if this

80
00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:05,219
makes it I'm glad you included that

81
00:03:03,539 --> 00:03:06,539
because I started this whole thing by

82
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:09,120
saying this came from our friend Jason

83
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:10,799
big up to my friend Jason this is a

84
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,658
great question so you've got two plants

85
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,700
and you can't decide which one to use as

86
00:03:12,658 --> 00:03:16,199
the pollen donor I've got some great

87
00:03:14,699 --> 00:03:18,959
advice

88
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:21,479
um I don't only do my selections based

89
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,699
on flavors Aroma potency there are a lot

90
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:25,619
of other things that I think about let's

91
00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:27,959
look at both of these plants and think

92
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:30,959
which plant has got the structure and

93
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:33,000
shape you are after in your progeny uh

94
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,280
think about how far apart the nodes are

95
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,199
the node spacing is the branch spacing

96
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,539
how much branching does the plant make

97
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:41,579
how is the plant overall shaped do you

98
00:03:39,539 --> 00:03:43,199
have a real tall skinny wispy plant or

99
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:45,299
do you have a short squat bushy wide

100
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:46,859
plant what do you want your plants in

101
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:48,840
the future to be shaped like that is a

102
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:50,760
very important factor to consider when

103
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:53,700
it does come to selecting your plants

104
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:55,739
also Leaf size and shape definitely make

105
00:03:53,699 --> 00:03:57,298
a big difference in that plant do you

106
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:59,219
want a long skinny Leaf do you want a

107
00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:00,659
big fat Broad Leaf do you want somewhere

108
00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:02,340
in the middle that's something to pay

109
00:04:00,658 --> 00:04:04,620
attention to also when it comes to

110
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:06,360
breeding think about the flowering time

111
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:08,280
of the selected plants you are going to

112
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:10,140
use that flowering time is going to

113
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,818
translate heavily into your breeding

114
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:13,679
project so do you have one that flowers

115
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:15,479
at a more appropriate time if one of

116
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,639
those plants flowers longer and one

117
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:19,319
flowers more quickly that trait will

118
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:21,600
pass if you use that plant in the

119
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:23,159
breeding project most likely the male is

120
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,900
going to heavily contribute to that

121
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,060
flowering time so keep that in mind or

122
00:04:24,899 --> 00:04:28,679
the reverse male we'll say pollen donor

123
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,120
from here out I'll try to remember to

124
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:33,540
say Paul and donor from here on I make

125
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:35,759
no promises so also do these plants

126
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:38,100
handle stress does it handle grower

127
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,139
stress by grower stress I mean can you

128
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:42,240
top it can you pop it can you lollipop

129
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:44,759
it can you twist it can you defoliate it

130
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,439
can you make mistakes with it can you

131
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:48,660
abuse it can you beat it up can you over

132
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:50,459
water it can you under water it can it

133
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:52,620
handle environmental stress that's kind

134
00:04:50,459 --> 00:04:54,359
of over water underwater but also how

135
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:56,160
about vapor pressure deficit issues

136
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,500
humidity spikes humidity drops

137
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,840
temperature spikes temperature drops

138
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,699
diurnal swings can these plants handle

139
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:04,500
those sort of things the one that

140
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:06,900
handles the stress the best is the one

141
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:09,478
that I would use as the pollen donor in

142
00:05:06,899 --> 00:05:11,698
my opinion and in my experience now you

143
00:05:09,478 --> 00:05:14,219
asked specifically which plant I would

144
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:16,439
recommend to use here this is my opinion

145
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:19,560
my advice and I will explain why I would

146
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:22,560
do this I've got a solid reason for it I

147
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:24,959
would choose the potent plant as the

148
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,879
pollen donor and allow that one to

149
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:28,379
pollinate multiple females it looks like

150
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:30,180
you've got one female plant that you

151
00:05:28,379 --> 00:05:32,159
want to pollinate but I would pollinate

152
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:34,680
multiple females the reason for that is

153
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:37,259
when you pollinate one female you kind

154
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,819
of see what uh the plant a and plant B

155
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:41,220
you can see what that brought to the

156
00:05:38,819 --> 00:05:44,819
table and what they made but if you put

157
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:46,800
plant a to plant b c and d put that

158
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:49,079
pollen on multiple females we can really

159
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,879
see what the boy is adding to the mix

160
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:52,439
because if you've got a female plant

161
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:54,360
that makes blueberry Terps a female

162
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:55,918
plant that makes chocolate Terps and a

163
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:58,020
female plant that makes banana Terps and

164
00:05:55,918 --> 00:05:59,399
then you add gas to it did you get I

165
00:05:58,019 --> 00:06:01,799
forgot the flavors already did you get

166
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:04,258
gassy blueberries gassy whatever else I

167
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:06,780
said and glassy bananas or is it all

168
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:08,580
bananas all gas see what that male is

169
00:06:06,779 --> 00:06:10,138
adding to the mix in there and see what

170
00:06:08,579 --> 00:06:12,120
it's contributing if you just make one

171
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:14,038
cross you only know how that male

172
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:16,019
interacts with that one female if you

173
00:06:14,038 --> 00:06:18,180
cross it to multiple females we can see

174
00:06:16,019 --> 00:06:20,758
how that male expresses itself on a

175
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:22,259
wider palette through more population in

176
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:24,300
my experience in my opinion that's

177
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:25,919
really helpful for selecting breeding

178
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:28,139
projects for selecting breeding males

179
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:30,240
breeding pears that really goes a long

180
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:32,579
way in my opinion in my experience I

181
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,500
know you're focused on making uh the

182
00:06:32,579 --> 00:06:36,240
grapefruit Kush and the terpy plant

183
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:38,459
together or the potent plant on the

184
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,840
terpy plant together but also why not if

185
00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:41,339
you're going to reverse one plant why

186
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:43,258
not put a couple of females in there

187
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:45,418
multiple females in the room with that

188
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:47,280
male to make multiple crosses a lot of

189
00:06:45,418 --> 00:06:49,258
seeds to play with that's just more fun

190
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:51,059
to me also that way like I said you get

191
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:53,400
to really see what that male plant is

192
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:55,680
bringing to the mix if you just add

193
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:57,239
um let's just say chocolate and vanilla

194
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,620
together we know what chocolate and

195
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,418
vanilla tastes like but what if I put

196
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:02,220
chocolate and strawberry does the

197
00:07:00,418 --> 00:07:03,719
chocolate diamond eat the mix does the

198
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:05,699
strawberry dominate The Mix or do I get

199
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:07,259
a nice Chocolate Strawberry mix let's

200
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:09,120
see what happens in there and see what

201
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:11,699
the plants do that way so I would start

202
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:14,100
by using the potent plant as my pollen

203
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:15,360
donor then what would happen in my

204
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,340
opinion what I think would happen and

205
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,439
I'm kind of doing this

206
00:07:17,339 --> 00:07:20,638
um I used when I made the uh Ninja

207
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,560
Turtle line I'm not sure if you've been

208
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,360
following for that long I took a

209
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,639
reversed blueberry cookies plaque that

210
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,800
blueberry cookies plant was amazing and

211
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,960
I pollinated a bunch of other female

212
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,120
plants with that plant and I named them

213
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:35,339
after the Ninja Turtles what I noticed

214
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,560
is the blueberry cookies showed itself

215
00:07:35,339 --> 00:07:40,500
very well in all of the other crosses

216
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:42,598
but it also Blended very well to a lot

217
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:44,579
of those crosses so what ended up

218
00:07:42,598 --> 00:07:46,319
happening was that potency from the

219
00:07:44,579 --> 00:07:48,719
Reversed blueberry cookies the potency

220
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:50,400
the Vigor the plant shape all the good

221
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,500
traits from that passed on to The

222
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:53,939
Offspring into the breeding project but

223
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,800
let's talk about I said Ninja Turtles

224
00:07:53,939 --> 00:07:57,120
lion we'll use Raphael as a good example

225
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,579
here that is a reversed blueberry

226
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,860
cookies pollinated a strawberry fields

227
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:03,779
plant makes Raphael when I bred those

228
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:05,280
two together I could really see the

229
00:08:03,779 --> 00:08:06,959
strawberry Starburst or the Strawberry

230
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:08,879
Fields traits I could smell it I could

231
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:10,859
taste it and then also it had the Vigor

232
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,839
the potency and some of the aroma and

233
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:14,939
flavor of the blueberry cookie so I was

234
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:16,978
able to get that potency the Vigor the

235
00:08:14,939 --> 00:08:19,079
plant shape all that good stuff into

236
00:08:16,978 --> 00:08:20,579
that other end of The Offspring and it

237
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:22,439
also brought a lot of that strawberry

238
00:08:20,579 --> 00:08:24,478
Flavor now let's talk about another one

239
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:26,879
in the mix was I pollinated the Platinum

240
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:29,098
Tangy and that made Michelangelo again I

241
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,780
got that growth structure the shape the

242
00:08:29,098 --> 00:08:33,000
Vigor from the blueberry cookies but I

243
00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:34,740
also got that Platinum Tangy Aroma and

244
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,839
flavor mixed in with the blueberry

245
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:38,038
cookies so my idea my goal would

246
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:40,020
actually ended up happening what I'm

247
00:08:38,038 --> 00:08:42,240
kind of recommending to you is use that

248
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:44,338
potency rely on the potency from that

249
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,139
reversed male then let the females

250
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:47,700
you're using change up the palate

251
00:08:46,139 --> 00:08:50,100
throughout each plant so maybe you got a

252
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:51,120
strawberry a orange a lemon uh what else

253
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,200
did I use there's a bunch of different

254
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,820
things in that mix but there's

255
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,680
definitely strawberry orange lemon and

256
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:57,360
blueberry in there and I brought all of

257
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:59,519
those out and mixed that with the

258
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,778
original blueberry cookies cross so if

259
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,820
this were me if this was my breeding

260
00:09:00,778 --> 00:09:05,159
project if I was in charge of this room

261
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:07,080
I would select the more potent plant the

262
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:09,360
plant with the more potency also don't

263
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:11,160
forget about Vigor plant structure

264
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,440
resistance are these plants resistant to

265
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:14,819
bugs pathogens do they get problems I

266
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,860
would find the best plant with the best

267
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:19,200
potency the best Vigor best resistance

268
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:21,600
that would be my pollen donor and then I

269
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,600
would rely on all those female plants to

270
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,860
be my my terp provider my flavor my

271
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,200
difference is because that male is going

272
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:30,480
to mix well with a lot of things if you

273
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,879
select the proper I said male once again

274
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,560
but that reversed female that pollen

275
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:36,360
donor plant so once you've done the

276
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:38,399
pollination once you've made seeds the

277
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:40,379
next step to do is to grow these seeds

278
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,179
out if you only pollinated that one

279
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:44,399
plant grow as many of those seeds as you

280
00:09:42,179 --> 00:09:46,259
possibly can see if you've created what

281
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,179
you're looking for did you find the

282
00:09:46,259 --> 00:09:49,500
terpy plant with the potency the Vigor

283
00:09:48,179 --> 00:09:51,599
the shape the structure you're looking

284
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,980
for is it in there if so then you've

285
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,959
done exactly what you're looking for

286
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:56,278
you've reached your breeding goal I

287
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:57,838
would take that plant and I would find

288
00:09:56,278 --> 00:09:59,759
something else to do with it to further

289
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,260
breed it maybe self that plant maybe

290
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:03,179
breed that to other things things but

291
00:10:01,259 --> 00:10:05,159
that would be my new keeper to start my

292
00:10:03,179 --> 00:10:07,079
new breeding project with if you've read

293
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:09,059
this to multiple females grow out a

294
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:10,379
bunch of those female seeds or seeds

295
00:10:09,059 --> 00:10:12,419
from those other plants and see what

296
00:10:10,379 --> 00:10:14,580
you've created see what that male plant

297
00:10:12,419 --> 00:10:16,620
is contributing to that mix amongst that

298
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:18,839
population of females that's so much fun

299
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:20,820
that's my favorite part taking a reverse

300
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:23,519
plant or a male plant pollinating a

301
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:25,260
bunch of girls not just growing out the

302
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,179
this batch and this batch but growing

303
00:10:25,259 --> 00:10:29,458
out all of them and seeing like oh the

304
00:10:27,179 --> 00:10:31,679
guy does this the guy made all of these

305
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:34,018
plants get a chocolate Aroma but also

306
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:35,579
they also added their own but also some

307
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:36,778
of the plants got like this weird Leaf

308
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:38,820
shape that came from the guy plant

309
00:10:36,778 --> 00:10:40,379
you'll notice what does cross and what

310
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:41,700
doesn't cross you'll notice you'll

311
00:10:40,379 --> 00:10:43,439
figure out what's a recessive trait

312
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,879
what's a dominant a co-dominant trait

313
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,920
you'll just learn a lot about your

314
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:49,799
plants by breeding them two other things

315
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:51,778
now I said originally that what I would

316
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:53,939
do is take the most potent plant and

317
00:10:51,778 --> 00:10:55,740
that would be my candidate for reversal

318
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:57,360
now you're really going to be blown away

319
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:58,980
by the next thing that I say after

320
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,659
you've done this cross after you've

321
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:02,579
taken your candidate that you've

322
00:11:00,659 --> 00:11:04,019
reversed and you've pollinated you've

323
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:05,578
grown it you found out some you found

324
00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:07,139
some seeds found out what you produced

325
00:11:05,578 --> 00:11:08,759
found the keeper out of there now guess

326
00:11:07,139 --> 00:11:11,100
what your next project is

327
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:13,078
do the opposite take that terpy one

328
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:15,300
reverse it pollinate the potent plant

329
00:11:13,078 --> 00:11:16,979
then grow it out again if you've got the

330
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:19,259
opportunity like I mentioned before grow

331
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:21,480
out pollinate multiple females with this

332
00:11:19,259 --> 00:11:23,278
reversal again if you can pollinate the

333
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,259
same females that you did the opposite

334
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:28,139
plant with and let's see what this plant

335
00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:30,958
is contributing to the mix now we get to

336
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:33,299
see what plant a does when it's reversed

337
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:35,278
and pollinates multiple females and we

338
00:11:33,299 --> 00:11:37,559
can see what traits deliver there then

339
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:39,480
we'll reverse plant B and pollinate

340
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:41,099
multiple females and see what traits

341
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,778
come up there then we can even see what

342
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,700
the male is delivering because now we

343
00:11:42,778 --> 00:11:46,078
can really see what the female is

344
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:48,300
contributing to the Cross because we've

345
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:50,519
pollinated with two different sets of

346
00:11:48,299 --> 00:11:52,259
pollen I know that's a lot to get to get

347
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:54,000
into that's really deep that's really uh

348
00:11:52,259 --> 00:11:55,799
it's really in-depth that's in the mind

349
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,120
of a breeder honestly once I make a

350
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:59,099
cross once I reverse something that's

351
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,480
what I want to do I want to reverse the

352
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,740
other one that I didn't choose and

353
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,539
reverse that and then pollinate

354
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:05,039
everything and then grow both batches

355
00:12:03,539 --> 00:12:07,620
side by side and see what I've created

356
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:08,699
it becomes really crazy uh but it is a

357
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:11,399
lot of fun it's a lot of passion once

358
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:13,440
you start this this could be a lifetime

359
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:15,720
project so don't ever Rush a breeding

360
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,760
project take your time do the

361
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:19,320
pollination let the seeds finish grow

362
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:20,700
out the population and find the plant

363
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,200
that you are looking for if the plant

364
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:24,240
that you're looking for is not in there

365
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:26,339
do it the opposite way pick different

366
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,539
parents never be discouraged with

367
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:29,399
breeding you'll always find something

368
00:12:27,539 --> 00:12:31,799
great however the goal here is to

369
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:33,480
improve upon these lines if your cross

370
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:34,679
doesn't come out so if these plants are

371
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,879
both I don't know your plants I don't

372
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:37,799
want to judge you but if these plants

373
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:39,360
are both sevens the goal is to come out

374
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:41,278
with a plant that is at least an eight

375
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,259
maybe a nine hopefully a ten if you can

376
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:45,240
do it but if you haven't improved upon

377
00:12:43,259 --> 00:12:46,980
the species of cannabis then that is

378
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,600
your responsibility to decide what to do

379
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:50,339
with those seeds if they're not amazing

380
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,480
maybe you don't pass them out to the

381
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:52,680
whole world don't share them with a

382
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,720
bunch of people maybe keep them to

383
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:56,039
yourself but if those are Stellar make

384
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,600
sure you do share those seeds with

385
00:12:56,039 --> 00:13:00,778
people get those out so that more people

386
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,639
can grow high quality ganja all right

387
00:13:00,778 --> 00:13:04,320
Jason Johnson I really feel like you got

388
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,539
me rambling pretty good on that one I

389
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,220
hope I answered your question uh don't

390
00:13:06,539 --> 00:13:11,278
just focus on the potency don't just

391
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:13,800
focus on those Aromas and flavors also

392
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:15,360
focus on Resistance how does it handle

393
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:17,338
problems how does it handle grower

394
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,680
stress environmental stress think about

395
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:21,180
all that other stuff as well but then I

396
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:23,519
would recommend choosing the plant with

397
00:13:21,179 --> 00:13:25,078
the potency and pollinating those terpy

398
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,879
females all right brother thank you for

399
00:13:25,078 --> 00:13:28,259

about hope everything is going great for

422
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:13,259
you as well it says I have two questions

423
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:15,240
question number one I was under the

424
00:14:13,259 --> 00:14:17,639
impression that if you sell a plant it

425
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:19,200
is a complete copy of the mom used but I

426
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:21,659
was recently told that this is not

427
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:23,220
exactly the case can you elaborate on

428
00:14:21,659 --> 00:14:25,439
that so that's the part one of the

429
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:27,600
question says and I also remember saying

430
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:30,360
something a while ago about an auto

431
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,278
flower collab is there any movement or

432
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,839
updates on that also the fam and I are

433
00:14:32,278 --> 00:14:35,039
planning I'm not going to read this part

434
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,480
they're moving near me and we're going

435
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:37,740
to hang out so I'm not going to read

436
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,420
where you're moving to because the whole

437
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:41,220
world doesn't need to know that but yes

438
00:14:39,419 --> 00:14:43,559
we will hang out we will take dabs I

439
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:44,940
look forward to that let's address the

440
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:47,698
second question first let's do it

441
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:50,699
backwards the Autoflower collab

442
00:14:47,698 --> 00:14:51,838
uh Daz with uh Night Owl seeds I'm not

443
00:14:50,698 --> 00:14:53,219
sure what he's calling himself this week

444
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,779
does you change your name a lot but I

445
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:57,540
try to keep up with you nothing but love

446
00:14:54,778 --> 00:15:00,000
and respect and congrats also uh Daz is

447
00:14:57,539 --> 00:15:02,219
uh working some Auto flower stuff with

448
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,100
some irie genetic stuff in there I don't

449
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:07,440
have uh solid info on exactly how far

450
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:09,240
Daz has gotten into that but I know the

451
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,760
project is making great success I've ran

452
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:14,100
some of the f1s I've looked at pictures

453
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:15,360
I'm not exactly sure how far he's gotten

454
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:18,060
with that I haven't kept in touch I

455
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:20,339
haven't asked but Daz is working on that

456
00:15:18,059 --> 00:15:22,500
feminized Autoflower project with the

457
00:15:20,339 --> 00:15:24,180
irie genetic strains in there so I would

458
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:26,159
make sure to check with uh Night Owl

459
00:15:24,179 --> 00:15:28,379
seeds check with Daz see what he's going

460
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:30,480
on he's probably got a lot more info and

461
00:15:28,379 --> 00:15:32,100
updates on that those will be available

462
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,079
through Night Owl I won't even have

463
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:35,699
those seeds that's all his project he's

464
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:38,399
got my blessing but I'm not into

465
00:15:35,698 --> 00:15:40,198
autoflowers if I made autoflowers uh it

466
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,698
wouldn't be very good I say it's like uh

467
00:15:40,198 --> 00:15:43,559
I can play any kind of music you want

468
00:15:41,698 --> 00:15:45,120
but if you put me in a country band I

469
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:46,979
can play country music but it's not

470
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,959
gonna feel like country music it's not

471
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:50,339
going to have whatever country he's got

472
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:52,319
that makes it feel country it's going to

473
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:53,820
be missing a little something it just

474
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,440
ain't going to have that feel that a

475
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,820
real country drummer could put to it so

476
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,040
that's why I don't make Autos they're

477
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:00,720
not for me all right let's answer the

478
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:02,639
first part of this email this is a very

479
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,980
good question it says I was under the

480
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,899
impression that if you sell the plant it

481
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:09,120
becomes a complete uh the seed should be

482
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:10,259
a complete copy of the mom that is a

483
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,639
good question let's take a little drink

484
00:16:10,259 --> 00:16:12,778
here and then we'll answer that not even

485
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:14,940
gonna edit this part I'm just gonna take

486
00:16:12,778 --> 00:16:17,278
a little drink keep moving shout out to

487
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:18,959

Dictionary kombucha lated that is when

491
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:26,100
you're well hydrated and have good

492
00:16:24,419 --> 00:16:28,379
microbes from drinking plenty of high

493
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:29,459
quality kombucha Rasta Jeff made that up

494
00:16:28,379 --> 00:16:31,198
I want [ __ ] credit for it

495
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:33,500
kombuchulated I'm gonna quit rambling

496
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:35,819
and take a drink

497
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:37,500
okay maybe I cut out a couple of seconds

498
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:39,420
maybe I didn't let's answer this

499
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,980
question about reversing a plant when

500
00:16:39,419 --> 00:16:42,539
you self a plant what does that mean

501
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:44,699
well we talked a moment ago about

502
00:16:42,539 --> 00:16:47,278
selecting plants for feminized breeding

503
00:16:44,698 --> 00:16:49,198
selfing a plant is when you take two

504
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:50,820
clones of the same plant so let's just

505
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:52,799
start with a Golden Goat plant I'm going

506
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:54,778
to cut two clones off of a Golden Goat

507
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:57,359
plant I'm going to let them grow we're

508
00:16:54,778 --> 00:16:59,519
going to flower them before I flour them

509
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,778
I'm going to treat one with a solution

510
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,480
we don't need to talk too much about

511
00:17:00,778 --> 00:17:04,980
that solution I'm going to spray it I'm

512
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,019
going to spray it several times I've got

513
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:08,939
a schedule I've got a program there's a

514
00:17:07,019 --> 00:17:10,740
standard operating procedure eventually

515
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:12,959
this plant is going to produce pollen

516
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:14,699
the pollen that comes from this plant is

517
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,980
only female pollen because the Golden

518
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:19,318
Goat plant that I started with does not

519
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:20,818
contain any male chromosomes so this

520
00:17:19,318 --> 00:17:22,859
plant is going to go sort of into a

521
00:17:20,818 --> 00:17:24,659
panic mode it's going to create pollen

522
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:27,178
sacs those pollen sacks will only

523
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:29,220
contain female pollen then I will take

524
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:32,220
that female pollen from the Golden Goat

525
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:35,038
and put it on another female Golden Goat

526
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:37,259
plant this is known as selfie this is

527
00:17:35,038 --> 00:17:40,140
called selfing I have S1 to this plant

528
00:17:37,259 --> 00:17:42,058
it is a first generation of a soft plant

529
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:45,059
I took the Golden Goat and the Golden

530
00:17:42,058 --> 00:17:47,940
Goat and I self them I call itself

531
00:17:45,058 --> 00:17:50,160
because it's a self-pollination there is

532
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:52,380
no other there are no other genetics

533
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:55,259
adulterating this mix but now I can make

534
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:58,380
pure Golden Goat seeds those will be

535
00:17:55,259 --> 00:18:00,660
feminized go Golden Goat S1 seeds now

536
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:02,280
the question that arises has arose has

537
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:03,298
been brought up that was asked I don't

538
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:04,918
even know what I'm saying anymore the

539
00:18:03,298 --> 00:18:06,359
question here is I was under the

540
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:09,000
impression that they would be a complete

541
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:10,859
copy of the mom approximately 50 to 70

542
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,200
percent of the phenotypes that come from

543
00:18:10,859 --> 00:18:15,899
those seeds will look just like the

544
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,519
original Golden Goat mother but some of

545
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:19,620
those plants are going to look a little

546
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:21,720
bit like the mother plot that was used

547
00:18:19,619 --> 00:18:23,159
to make Golden Goat and some will look a

548
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:25,259
little bit like the father plant that

549
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:27,480
was used to make the Golden Goat so I'm

550
00:18:25,259 --> 00:18:29,160
going to say 50 to 60 maybe 70 percent

551
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,419
of those are going to be right down the

552
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:32,220
middle they're going to look just like

553
00:18:30,419 --> 00:18:34,200
that original golden go but you're going

554
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:35,700
to have some on this side that look a

555
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,500
little bit like the mom plant that made

556
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:39,000
Golden Goat and some on this side that

557
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:41,099
look a little bit like the dad plant

558
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,079
that made Golden Goat we may also see

559
00:18:41,099 --> 00:18:45,240
phenotypes that Express traits of the

560
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:47,639
grandparents of the original Golden Goat

561
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:49,798
so we may see traits of the mom and then

562
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:52,200
also traits of the mom's parents and

563
00:18:49,798 --> 00:18:54,058
traits of the dad and also traits of the

564
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,980
dad's parents the only way to really

565
00:18:54,058 --> 00:18:58,200
identify that is to be familiar with

566
00:18:55,980 --> 00:19:00,298
parents and grandparents of that plant

567
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:02,038
but when I grow it out I can identify it

568
00:19:00,298 --> 00:19:03,418
because I know what used I know all of

569
00:19:02,038 --> 00:19:04,558
the ingredients so I could taste that I

570
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:06,419
could say oh there's the cinnamon

571
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:08,339
there's the butter there's the maple

572
00:19:06,419 --> 00:19:10,080
syrup I can identify every ingredient by

573
00:19:08,339 --> 00:19:12,298
looking at it because I'm so familiar

574
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:14,819
with each parent plant so when you make

575
00:19:12,298 --> 00:19:17,038
those reversals most of the time about

576
00:19:14,819 --> 00:19:18,839
50 percent of them and I say most of the

577
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:21,240
time because these are genetics this

578
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:22,980
depends very much on the plant that you

579
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:25,319
are working with some plants reverse

580
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:27,360
very well some plants don't reverse well

581
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:29,339
at all some plants when you reverse them

582
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:31,079
they make a bunch of intersex problems

583
00:19:29,339 --> 00:19:32,819
some plants when you reverse them they

584
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:34,740
make a bunch of amazing gold like the

585
00:19:32,819 --> 00:19:36,839
Golden Goat it makes a whole bunch of

586
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:39,000
amazingness but some plants a lot of

587
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:41,099
chem cultivars a lot of the sour diesel

588
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,740
stuff if you reverse that it just makes

589
00:19:41,099 --> 00:19:45,659
intersex garbage so in my experience

590
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:47,579
when I self a plant I generally get

591
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:49,500
about 50 percent of the phenotypes they

592
00:19:47,579 --> 00:19:51,178
look just like the original mom and then

593
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:53,038
I've got that group that looks a little

594
00:19:51,179 --> 00:19:54,360
bit like Grandma the group that looks a

595
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:56,519
little bit like Grandpa and then we've

596
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:58,740
got those outliers that look little bit

597
00:19:56,519 --> 00:20:00,359
like the great grandparents now let's

598
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:03,359
talk about something else really quickly

599
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:05,939
not all feminized seeds are what are

600
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:09,058
known as self-seeds a lot of feminized

601
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:10,919
seeds are also known as reversals a

602
00:20:09,058 --> 00:20:13,079
moment ago I talk about taking two

603
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:14,880
clones of the same Golden Goat plant we

604
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:17,339
reverse the Golden Goat we put that

605
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,440
pollen on Golden Goat we have self that

606
00:20:17,339 --> 00:20:21,839
plant it did it to itself it got itself

607
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,400
pregnant it gave itself a selfie you'll

608
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:26,159
never forget that that plant itself

609
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:28,440
that's an S1 what if I put that Golden

610
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:30,720
Goat pollen on something different what

611
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:32,580
if I put that Golden Goat pollen on a

612
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:35,038
GMO plant and I make something we call

613
00:20:32,579 --> 00:20:37,139
Garlic go that is no longer selfing

614
00:20:35,038 --> 00:20:39,720
because I didn't pollinate itself I

615
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:42,000
pollinated another plant with reversed

616
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:44,220
pollens so instead of being an S1 that

617
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,919
plant would be labeled an R1 it is a

618
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:48,900
first filial generation of a reversed

619
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:51,240
cross so sometimes you're going to see

620
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:53,759
plants that say S1 sometimes they may

621
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:56,339
say R1 sometimes it may not give you any

622
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:58,259
indication at all if it is a golden and

623
00:20:56,339 --> 00:21:00,480
go feminized seed and you know that it's

624
00:20:58,259 --> 00:21:02,879
a clone only that is most likely the

625
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:05,038
original plant reversed and self done to

626
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,780
itself but if it is something like let's

627
00:21:05,038 --> 00:21:09,298
talk about like I just said a moment ago

628
00:21:06,779 --> 00:21:13,619
the uh the garlic goat that is a Golden

629
00:21:09,298 --> 00:21:15,839
Goat to the GMO that is a reversal that

630
00:21:13,619 --> 00:21:18,298
is going to show us phenotypes that look

631
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:20,099
like the 50 50 mix probably close to 50

632
00:21:18,298 --> 00:21:21,900
50. it's going to be pretty close to 50

633
00:21:20,099 --> 00:21:24,359
50. you'll find some that look just like

634
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:26,160
Golden Goat just like the GMO combined

635
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:27,538
we're going to see that phenotype then

636
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,400
we're going to see phenotypes that look

637
00:21:27,538 --> 00:21:30,839
a little bit like GMO then we're going

638
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,820
to see phenotypes that look a little bit

639
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:35,220
like Golden Goat then guess what we're

640
00:21:32,819 --> 00:21:37,079
also going to see some phenotypes a very

641
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:39,000
small percentage of the phenotypes are

642
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:40,259
going to look like golden goats parents

643
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,359
and some of the phenotypes will look

644
00:21:40,259 --> 00:21:43,798
like the GMO parents and then you're

645
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:45,418
going to have a couple of phenotypes

646
00:21:43,798 --> 00:21:46,679
that you can't tell what the hell is

647
00:21:45,419 --> 00:21:48,179
going on and she's got traits from

648
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:50,038
everybody it looks like the mailman's

649
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:52,559
kid that does happen a little bit when

650
00:21:50,038 --> 00:21:53,819
you start doing the uh the reversals so

651
00:21:52,558 --> 00:21:56,279
that's the basic difference between

652
00:21:53,819 --> 00:21:58,139
selfing and reversing and those are the

653
00:21:56,279 --> 00:22:00,480
basic phenotypes and traits that I think

654
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:02,460
you are going to find with those femini

655
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,839
seeds with the self seeds most your

656
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:05,340
phenotypes are going to look like the

657
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:06,599
original mom we'll find some

658
00:22:05,339 --> 00:22:08,819
grandparents and a little bit of great

659
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:10,859
grandparents with the reversals that are

660
00:22:08,819 --> 00:22:13,019
not pure self you're going to see the 50

661
00:22:10,859 --> 00:22:14,219
50 phenotype that looks like Mom and Dad

662
00:22:13,019 --> 00:22:16,200
you're going to find some that look like

663
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:17,519
moms some that look like Dad some that

664
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,319
look like grandparents and then you're

665
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:21,599
gonna find some weirdos that looks like

666
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:23,339
weird mixes of each trait like you just

667
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:25,259
shook took all the traits that were

668
00:22:23,339 --> 00:22:27,538
available from both plants the leaf

669
00:22:25,259 --> 00:22:30,119
shape the structure the odor uh the

670
00:22:27,538 --> 00:22:31,859
flavor trichome development took both of

671
00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:33,359
those and just shook them up took all

672
00:22:31,859 --> 00:22:35,038
the trade Counts from each plant shook

673
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:36,779
them up and just grew them and who knows

674
00:22:35,038 --> 00:22:38,400
what what ornaments got hung on which

675
00:22:36,779 --> 00:22:39,899
tree which alleles got given to each

676
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,820
plant but sometimes you're going to see

677
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:43,679
some that just looks like you just mixed

678
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:45,240
up Mr Potato Head and got the parts that
