115
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:24,158
notes in the business part of the show

116
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:26,399
i've got a question that came from

117
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:27,359
patreon this one comes from our friend

118
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,000
papa z

119
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,000
it says what up rosta jeff papa z here

120
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,959
several weeks ago i sent an email for a

121
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,719
seed tester application as did a lot of

122
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,560
people i did an episode asking

123
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:40,239
for people who wanted to be testers of

124
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,039
my seeds and my new creations of my

125
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,920
genetics

126
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:45,598
i got a lot of uh tester applications

127
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:46,000
this says i never heard anything back

128
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:48,238
but my

129
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,519
question is this before i even get to

130
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,640
the question

131
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,560
i got an overwhelming amount of tester

132
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:55,839
applications i'm still finding them i'm

133
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,519
still going through them they are now

134
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,479
moved to a folder that says tester

135
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,959
applications

136
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:02,318
i've sent out quite a few tester seeds

137
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,598
i'm still going through them if you

138
00:04:02,318 --> 00:04:05,199
haven't gotten testers if you haven't

139
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:07,119
gotten a response

140
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:09,119
don't take it personally don't take it

141
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,719
as a rejection i'm always going to be

142
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,840
making new things i'm always going to

143
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:13,359
need testers

144
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,039
at different levels for different

145
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,479
projects so don't be shy

146
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:18,478
uh don't feel like you've gotten turned

147
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:19,519
down you still may get selected out of

148
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:21,519
that tester pull

149
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,360
uh we're always hiring is kind of the

150
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,360
attitude here anyway let me jump into

151
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,280
the question it says what could i do

152
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,280
to what could i do differently to make

153
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:29,679
me a better candidate for you to choose

154
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:31,839
me

155
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,360
to test for you i believe in always

156
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:34,719
growing with the intent of each run

157
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,479
being better than the last

158
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,320
so i would like to know what areas i'm

159
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:40,879
lacking in as i want to be the best

160

trying to become

164
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:50,879
better um i can't say anything

165
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,960
specifically that you can do

166
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:55,120
to be a better candidate as a tester i

167
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:57,439
need all different kinds of testers i

168

need i need testers of all

169
00:04:57,439 --> 00:05:01,600
skill levels i need some people that are

170
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,800
better as photographers than growers i

171
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,960
need some people that are real

172
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,639
analytical and send me over detailed

173
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:08,399
reports on what they fed them

174
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,240
some people just send me a picture every

175
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:11,758
week and that's basically what i get

176
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,519
some people send me a report on what

177
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,759
they fed it what they did to it

178
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:17,279
i get a lot of varying reports i expect

179
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,439
a few different things but i know that

180
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:21,279
humans are going to do things their way

181
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:23,199
so by giving my seeds out to a bunch of

182
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:25,119
people who do things their way i get a

183
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,680
lot of great feedback people find their

184
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,519
niche

185
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,519
uh their way their spot how to be a

186
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:31,359
tester for me and they just do what they

187
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:33,599
do the best so

188
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,199
to be a good tester i would say do what

189
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,720
you do the best i need someone that can

190
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,000
communicate that's one of the things i

191
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,840
really look forward to

192
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,439
i send out a lot of seeds and i've said

193
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:43,758
it before about

194
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:45,439
three out of every 10 back packs of

195
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,240
tester seeds i send

196
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:49,600
the testers just lose communication

197
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,600
eventually maybe they get the seeds they

198
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,120
don't even reply once they've got them

199
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,720
maybe they say hey thanks for the seeds

200
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,160
and that's all i get from them or they

201
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,120
send me a couple of weeks of reports and

202
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,919
then they fade off

203
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,519
but my point is uh sometimes i send out

204
00:05:59,918 --> 00:06:03,038
testers i don't even get communication

205
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:04,478
so be able to communicate with me

206
00:06:03,038 --> 00:06:06,399
take some photos let me know what's

207
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:07,599
going on that's basically what i asked

208
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:09,198
for for my testers

209
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,720
for you specifically i don't have

210
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,240
anything that i could tell you to make

211
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,199
you a better tester however i did

212
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,400
respond to you

213
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,639
and i did let you know that being a

214
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:17,918
patreon contributor shows me that you've

215
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,000
been around for a while

216
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:21,519
uh having longitude having been around

217
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,120
the group definitely helps you out there

218
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:24,399
may be a little bit of favoritism being

219
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,519
played in that sort of thing but if i've

220
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:27,279
seen your name a lot

221
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:29,279

00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:35,839
i find some great testers and these new

226
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:37,599
random friends we're making

227
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:39,279

00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,319
test seed since you have been a long

232
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,879
time

233
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:49,039
patreon supporter again you guys if i

234
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:50,639

235
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:51,199
if i haven't not agreed to send you

236
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,680

listen to that tester episode if you

239
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,759
haven't listened to it and you're still

240
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,598
interested in being a tester

241
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,879
still keep sending in the tester apps i

242
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:02,240
will get to them

243
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:04,319
i'm just going through looking at

244
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,319
pictures choosing what i need for now

245
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,840
i don't always need the exact same thing

246
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,240
like i said sometimes i need the guys

247
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:10,719
with

248
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,759
the super detailed and gals with the

249
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,919
super detailed

250
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:15,598
uh dirt notes i get a lot of notes from

251
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:17,519
one person about what's in their soil

252
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:19,439
they're running organic living soil

253
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:20,959
i get to know everything about that i

254
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,399
haven't gotten any details on the plants

255
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:23,680
but i know what's in the dirt every week

256
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:26,560
some people tell me

257
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,160
uh every micro mole of light that is

258
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,680
happening to the plants i get just a lot

259
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,520
of varying different things

260
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,959
and that gives me a lot of data so every

261
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:34,000
scientist is going to do their own

262
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:35,359
experiment

263
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,038
that kind of still falls in my

264
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,038
guidelines my expectations

265
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:40,800
and it works out for me very well so be

266
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:42,879
the best grower you could be

267
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,560
be able to have repeatable processes

268
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:46,719
that's the sort of stuff i look for

269
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,478
if you're not just doing crazy random

270
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,240
experiments with every batch i'd like to

271
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:50,959
see some sort of continuity some sort of

272
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,800
process

273
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:54,478
a standard operating procedure would be

274
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,240
ideal

275
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:58,240
and the ability to communicate and speak

276
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,519
well and talk to me well is great so you

277
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,199
seem to have those skills

278
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:02,959
so we will be in touch big shout out to

00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:47,199
is more asking about they say concerning

335
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:49,039
ire genetics they're going to focus on

336
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,600
my seed brand here it says

337
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:52,559
what factors influence a decision to

338
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,440
retire

339
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:57,199
a strain so you'll notice that on some

340
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,959
of the vending websites some on some

341
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,360
spots on my website it says that this

342
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:02,319
train

343
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:04,159
strain has been discontinued or retired

344
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,399
what influences my decision to

345
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:08,399
discontinue or retire a strain there are

346
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:11,839
a lot of things that go into that

347
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:14,078
um a lot of it is uh honestly

348
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,079
does it sell sometimes i will make a

349
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:17,759
strain it will be hot fire i'll think

350
00:10:16,078 --> 00:10:19,199
it's gonna sell like crazy i'll have

351
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:21,039
thousands of seeds of it

352
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,519
i'll market it the way that i normally

353
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:25,039
do advertise the way i do do my strategy

354
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,320
give it out to a bunch of great growers

355
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:29,199
that take great photos

356
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,680
spread it around the world go to sell it

357
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,680
and

358
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:33,439
there's no steam that strain just

359
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:34,879
doesn't go anywhere so i've got bags of

360
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,320
that seed sitting around when it comes

361
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:37,600
time to make more seeds guess what i

362
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,480
don't make more of

363
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,200
that [ __ ] uh it's just uh a lot of it is

364
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,278
what sells

365
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,959
unfortunately that's what uh it's a

366
00:10:43,278 --> 00:10:46,639
business it's a seed company so that's

367
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:48,239
what drives a lot of decisions is

368
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:49,919
business what sells

369
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,360
if something is not selling and i've got

370
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:53,278
bags of it sitting around

371
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,639
uh it's i'm not gonna make any more of

372
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:57,278
it there's no need so

373
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:58,399
that's the bottom line honestly well we

374
00:10:57,278 --> 00:11:00,159
talk about grow from your heart and

375
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,078
everything but as a seed breeder

376
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:04,000
i breed with love grow for my heart but

377
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:05,439
when it comes to keeping inventory and

378
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,200
deciding what to remake

379
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,240
the bottom line is what sells and what

380
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,519
seeds are going to sit there i don't

381
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,720
want to have a bunch of useless seeds

382
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:13,519
that nobody wants

383
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,639
so bottom line is what sells another

384
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,399
thing is

385
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:17,838
the mother plant makes a big decision

386
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,200
let's talk about a strain a couple of

387
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,519
strains i have recently

388
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,040
retired or discontinued let's talk about

389
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,519
the rocksteady

390
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:27,838
rocksteady was part of the tmnt line

391
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,799
rocksteady came from the durbin poison

392
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:31,839
female

393
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:33,519
uh also what came from that the uh the

394
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:36,560
dragon punch came from the

395
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:38,399
uh the durbin poison female plant both

396
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:40,719
of those strains have been retired

397
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,159
because that mother plant was a pain in

398
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,600
the ass to keep in the garden that

399
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:45,838
durbin poison plant

400
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,519
did not she just didn't fit the program

401
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,120
the other plants liked a certain light

402
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,560
cycle a certain feeding regimen a

403
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,360
certain vpd

404
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:54,479
and that durbin poison plant did not

405
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,639
want to participate

406
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,879
that little [ __ ] wanted its own vpd its

407
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,560
own feeding regimen its own details

408
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:02,159
and i can't have a prima donna in my

409
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:03,518
garden like that if i'm trying to run a

410
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:05,120
schedule and uh

411
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,560
just the way i'm trying to do it it

412
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,879
didn't work so

413
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:10,000
that led to all of the subsequent

414
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:12,399
breeding projects from that

415
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,559
plant being abandoned and discontinued

416
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:16,639
so the rocksteady is gone

417
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:18,319
the double dragon is gone and that's

418
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,200
because i did not like working with that

419
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,959
mother plant

420
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,200
another thing that determines on if i

421
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:26,239
keep it in the breeding stable or not is

422
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,278
uh how many seeds does it make a lot of

423
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,399
plants give me

424
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:31,679
a generous amount of seeds the mac sucks

425
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,958
at giving me seeds

426
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:34,319
if i put and this these are just

427
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:35,439
hypothetical numbers i'm going to make

428
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,760
up some numbers here

429
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,480
if i put a strawberry starburst plant

430
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:40,480
right here

431
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,320
and a mac one plant right here and i

432
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,360
pollinate them both equally with a king

433
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,360
solomon plant

434
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,959
if this strawberry starburst plant were

435
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,759
to make a thousand seeds i'm just making

436
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:50,958
up a number

437
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:54,958
this mac one plant may give me five

438
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:56,559
maybe 20 seeds if i'm absolutely lucky

439
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:58,479
oh excuse me for that i've tried to

440
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:59,919
pollinate the mac at different times

441
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,759
i've tried to pollinate the mac at

442
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:03,519
different intervals i've tried different

443
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:05,439
tricks to pollinate the mac plant

444
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:07,360
and it's just stingy it doesn't want to

445
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,959
give me enough seeds to make it worth my

446
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,480
production time so

447
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:12,159
when i'm breeding i just put one little

448
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,360
small plant at the back of the room

449
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:15,278
in the room and let it get hit with

450
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,879
pollen and if it makes seeds it does and

451
00:13:15,278 --> 00:13:18,320
i'm excited and if not that's what we

452
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,759
[ __ ] expected and we just smoked the

453
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,079
mack buds the way they are

454
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:23,278
so a lot of it is how many seeds does a

455
00:13:22,078 --> 00:13:25,039
plant produce

456
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:26,879
also does the mother plant just

457
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:28,480
basically fit in the program i talked

458
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:30,320
about that durbin poison if it doesn't

459
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,800
fit the program it's got to go

460
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,959
i've got a certain way i run my grow a

461
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:37,120
certain schedule a certain style

462
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:38,958
it's like i'm just gonna pick a brand

463
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,560
this is a volkswagen shop and if you

464
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:42,638
bring in ferrari parts

465
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:44,479
they gotta go dude they're great parts

466
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:46,159
but they just don't fit on my volkswagen

467
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,920
maybe they do i'm not the engineer here

468
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:48,719
but you guys get what i'm saying right

469
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:50,078
um

470
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,920
yeah so if it doesn't fit the program

471
00:13:50,078 --> 00:13:54,479
it's just got to go so it's all about

472
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:56,078
the mother plant may get it tossed out

473
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,440
sales if you guys aren't into it if you

474
00:13:56,078 --> 00:13:59,039
guys aren't buying those seeds there's

475
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,399
no need for me to keep it going i will

476
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:03,360
retire it

477
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:04,240
production and then a big thing is uh

478
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,120
the market

479
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:09,120
i'm trying to i get bored of things

480
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,879
honestly i've got add you could tell by

481
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,560
watching this podcast i've got a little

482
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:14,720
bit of the add there

483
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:16,479
i get bored of growing smoking breeding

484
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,360
playing working with all the same [ __ ]

485
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,320
forever

486
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:22,079
and also uh added to that we are limited

487
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,560
by the amount of plants we are allowed

488
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:26,239
to have here in colorado i can have six

489
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:27,759
because of my recreational rights here

490
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,600
in colorado i'm allowed six

491
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:30,958
extra because my medical cannabis rights

492
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,920
here in colorado

493
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:34,879
that limits me to 12 plants in my grow

494
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:37,039
so imagine

495
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:38,879
trying to breed having 12 plants you

496
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:40,000
select your very favorite keepers and

497
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:40,720
then you've got a few that you can

498
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,198
pollinate

499
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,000
i'm only allowed to have so many so that

500
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:46,159
means that the

501
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,679
only the best of the best are able to

502
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:48,159
stick around i've got to get rid of some

503
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:49,679
stuff

504
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:51,439
and anytime i want to bring in something

505
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:52,239
new that means that something else has

506
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,760
to go

507
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,440
so hopefully i've got a friend around

508
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:57,039
here with the grow that's got some empty

509
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,320
space and they can run a few things and

510
00:14:57,039 --> 00:15:00,078
help me select stuff

511
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,079
then we run a pack of seeds finally keep

512
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:02,879
her out of that and their legal six

513
00:15:02,078 --> 00:15:04,799
plant grow

514
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:06,320
then i decide which one of my babies i

515
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:07,039
got a colon get rid of that is a

516
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,720
challenge

517
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:10,480
cut that [ __ ] down bring the keeper

518
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,519
from the other grow add that right to

519
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,120
the numbers we're still

520
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,799
still staying at the legal amounts

521
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,480
everybody's in their legal numbers

522
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:18,399
that's how things have to go so

523
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,159
sometimes uh it's just all about how

524
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,919
many plants we're allowed to have also

525
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:24,240
it's all about moving forward

526
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:26,078
uh once so the irie army the people who

527
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,879
buy ire genetic seeds

528
00:15:26,078 --> 00:15:30,319
there's a very nice occult if you will

529
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:32,480
of people who if i put out a pack of

530
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,480
seeds i'm sure i can sell this many

531
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,720
then there are other people who find me

532
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,839
through websites and new customers and

533
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,920
whatever you want to call them new

534
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,360
clients that develop over time but i've

535
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:43,120
got a nice little core of people who

536
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,120
will buy so many then there's a fringe

537
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:47,360
and then there's the new customers

538
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,879
once the core has got them they kind of

539
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,320
stop selling it's like a baseball card

540
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:51,360
once the all the collectors have the

541
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,720
baseball cards

542
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,560
they don't sell anymore so then it's

543
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,278
time for me to make new baseball cards

544
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:57,518
find the new hit

545
00:15:55,278 --> 00:15:59,039
player and that is part of uh being a

546
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,560
seed company i'm always making new

547
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:02,000
things finding new stuff keeping

548
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:04,000
cannabis evolving

549
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,679
i like to breed brand new things and

550
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,198
then go back and find that brand new

551
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:09,039
[ __ ] and breed that back to some of my

552
00:16:07,198 --> 00:16:10,799
older school stuff just to revive that

553
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:14,159
and keep new stuff coming

554
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:17,519
as a a seed breeder a business person uh

555
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:19,039
a cannabis connoisseur uh a passionate

556
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,440
botanist i guess you might want to call

557
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:21,120
me

558
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,639
i am a person with [ __ ] adult

559
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,519
attention disorder or whatever you want

560
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:25,278
to call that

561
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:27,039
i just have to have new things new

562
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:28,879
breeding projects new plants

563
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:30,719
can't sit still i think when i sit still

564
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:32,399
that's said it earlier when i sit still

565
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,879
that's when i get bored i cause problems

566
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,480
for

567
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:35,759
not necessarily problems but you know

568
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,519
that's when you end up [ __ ] in a

569
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:39,039
[ __ ] battle on facebook or something

570
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:41,759
wasting your time

571
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:43,039
the uh idle hands or the devil's

572
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,560
playground is what i think i'm trying to

573
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:46,319
say so i keep myself busy

574
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:48,078
uh focused on the business focused on

575
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,480
breeding focused on plants

576
00:16:48,078 --> 00:16:51,278
uh that's how my brain works so uh that

577
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,680
is a big

578
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:54,559
factor on what decides to retire a

579
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,239
strain

580
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:57,599
sales are the bottom line how do you

581
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,680
guys react to it

582
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,920
also if i discover that somebody else

583
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:04,159
has the same strain name as me

584
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:05,519
i will just stop making that strain i

585
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,199
don't want to compete with anybody i

586
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:09,199
don't want to piss anybody off if

587
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,798
that person that man that woman used

588
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,558
that name they deserve the right to that

589
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:14,798
name i don't want to step on their toes

590
00:17:12,558 --> 00:17:15,918
if i made a faux pas a cannabis mistake

591
00:17:14,798 --> 00:17:17,599
a breeder mistake

592
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:19,199
and i didn't do my due diligence and

593
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:21,918
researching that name

594
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:23,038
i will simply retire my cross just to

595
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,880
show that i

596
00:17:23,038 --> 00:17:26,798
uh respect the other person they're

597
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,600
breeding their selections their names

598
00:17:26,798 --> 00:17:29,279
their game

599
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:30,879
cannabis in general so that's another

600
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:32,639
reason why [ __ ] gets retired sometimes

601
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,880
simply because of the name

602
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,080
the mother plant has a lot to do with it

603
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,000
the female plant

604
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:39,279
uh the production from that female plant

605
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,558
has a lot to do with it

606
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:42,399
i feel like i'm repeating myself

607
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:45,519
sometimes i realize

608
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:47,360
that ah feminize crosses it's a pain in

609
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:49,359
the ass to make a lot of feminized

610
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:50,879
crosses sometimes i realize i got myself

611
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:52,319
in over my head and i just simply don't

612
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,640
want to make that anymore

613
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:56,159
uh because the plant doesn't make enough

614
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,120
also sometimes

615
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,640
and you guys all know what i'm talking

616
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:00,079
about here sometimes i name strains

617
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,038
after a bunch of famous cartoon

618
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,798
characters

619
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:04,319
and they get way more popular than i

620
00:18:02,798 --> 00:18:05,599
anticipated it would ever get and then i

621
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:07,119
fear that i'm going to get a cease and

622
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:07,918
desist letter and they're going to sue

623
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:10,319
me

624
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:12,000
that may be why a few strains got

625
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:13,200
retired here you guys probably know

626
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,319
which ones i'm talking about if you

627
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,000
followed along but

628
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:18,240
that is why some things get discontinued

629
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,400
and retired there are several reasons

630
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,679
a lot of it is just basic business what

631
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,840
sells and what doesn't

632
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:25,679
sometimes the names are used sometimes i

633
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:27,279
fear that cease and desist letter

634
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,880
all right there is a second part to this

635
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:30,480
question i hope i can cover this one as

636
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,960
well as i did the first part

637
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,640
it says concerning pheno hunting this

638
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,960
will be good i love pheno hunting let's

639
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:39,200
say what a phenohunt is pheno hunt is

640
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:41,440
when you've got a package of seeds

641
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,400
a number of seeds a population and you

642
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,120
were growing them

643
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,840
to select the phenotype from that batch

644
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:47,678
of seeds

645
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:49,439
that performs best for your needs it

646
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:52,000
could be your medical needs

647
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,200
your recreational needs your hustling

648
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,720
market needs i don't know if you're

649
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,558
selling it smoking it trading it

650
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,798
pressing it but the one that fits your

651
00:18:56,558 --> 00:19:00,639
needs your grow your desires the best

652
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:02,400
you were trying to find the phenotype

653
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,000
out of a package of seeds because

654
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,160
when you're growing from seed there will

655
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,519
be variation you'll find different

656
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,480
phenotypes that's what we call the

657
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:10,240
variants

658
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,759
different phenos different expressions

659
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,599
so you want to find the one that works

660
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:14,798
best for you that is a phenohunt we do

661
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:17,439
that by growing them out

662
00:19:14,798 --> 00:19:18,558
take a clone finish the plants smoke

663
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,080
grow them smoke them

664
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:22,079
find which one you like the best then

665
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:24,159
you got a clone of each one kept back

666
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:26,079
you can do it all over again now uh

667
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,480
that's a phenohunt and the quick way it

668
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:29,678
says

669
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,400
when growing out a pack of 10 seeds by

670
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,320
what week

671
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,840
from germination have you made your

672
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:37,119
decision to cull

673
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:38,879
a pair for breeding so the question is

674
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:40,479
basically if i've got a 10 pack of seeds

675
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:43,120
that i plan to breed with

676
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,000
how far into the how far from

677
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:46,000
germination

678
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,440
do i select breeders and do i start

679
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,240
removing things

680
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,200
from the gene pool that's a very good

681
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,839
question

682
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,600
uh and it's got there's no solid answer

683
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:58,319
there's a lot of variation to that

684
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:59,279
sometimes i'll see early on that uh that

685
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:02,158
plant right there

686
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:03,119
is really slow and shitty and just

687
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,039
doesn't do

688
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:06,639
uh so the main part of breeding i guess

689
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:08,319
let me back up the main part of breeding

690
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,600
is having a goal what are you what are

691
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:11,038
you trying to do

692
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:12,639
uh if you're trying to make pizza you

693
00:20:11,038 --> 00:20:13,440
need pizza ingredients if you're trying

694
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,880
to make

695
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,640
uh what's something if you're trying to

696
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,320
make a [ __ ] pumpkin pie you need

697
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,679
vastly different ingredients so

698
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:21,279
if i'm growing a plant trying to make

699
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,919
pizza and it's showing me pumpkin pie

700
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:23,759
trades

701
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:25,679
why keep it around that one goes early

702
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:26,879
but if i'm seeing hints of pizza over

703
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:28,240
here on these traits

704
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,919
then i'll keep those pizza plants

705
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,079
because i'm trying to make me some pizza

706
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:33,360
so that is a big part of it find what my

707
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:34,558
goal is

708
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:36,639
then just get rid of the plants that

709
00:20:34,558 --> 00:20:38,480
don't reach the goal basically

710
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,320
then we'll look for the mutants the

711
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,159
weirdos the oddities

712
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:43,599
just things that are obviously not what

713
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:45,039
i want maybe that one like i said

714
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:46,959
earlier grows too slow

715
00:20:45,038 --> 00:20:48,079
maybe it's too finicky maybe it doesn't

716
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,759
want enough water maybe

717
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:52,000
it's super thirsty and it wants a whole

718
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:54,240
bunch of water uh that plant those

719
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,720
plants will slowly get cold

720
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,798
sometimes sometimes it's really early

721
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,798
really really early sometimes it's

722
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:02,720
the middle of the veg phase a lot of

723
00:21:00,798 --> 00:21:04,319
times i can spot the boys from the girls

724
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,600
because the boys get real tall if i'm

725
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:07,038
not looking for boys

726
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:09,359
sometimes i'll just take the liberty to

727
00:21:07,038 --> 00:21:10,480
toss that super tall plant also is too

728
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:12,079
tall

729
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,240
probably didn't fit the [ __ ] breeding

730
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:16,000
program i start watching the structure

731
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,880
of the plan you can tell that early in

732
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,798
veg

733
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,080
three four maybe five weeks into veg you

734
00:21:18,798 --> 00:21:21,359
can tell what you're working with by the

735
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:23,519
shape the structure

736
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:25,038
uh start giving it some stem rubs see

737
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:26,400
what it can handle if it can't handle my

738
00:21:25,038 --> 00:21:29,519
rooms my regimen my

739
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,240
way of growing it's gotta go so that can

740
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:31,839
happen

741
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,519
all the way through veg sometimes up

742
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:35,759
into flower sometimes i don't

743
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:37,599
even decide that they've got to go until

744
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:39,359
flower sometimes you don't see

745
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:40,959
i look for bud set doesn't start making

746
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:43,199
big chunky buzz does it make small

747
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,038
spindly buds does it take a long time

748
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,200
to kick into flower does it stretch a

749
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:48,480
whole bunch does it do the dreaded

750
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,798
intersex trait

751
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,798
if it does that it goes immediately i

752
00:21:50,798 --> 00:21:54,960
can find an intersex straight a week

753
00:21:52,798 --> 00:21:56,400
to a flower or week nine a flower and

754
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,319
we're just gonna chop that [ __ ] down

755
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,880
and get rid of it and not do it again

756
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:02,319
so i got all the way up till sometimes

757
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,000
we don't decide that we're going to cull

758
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:05,119
something for a breeding project or make

759
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,038
a final decision

760
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:08,879
until we actually smoke the finished

761
00:22:07,038 --> 00:22:11,519
product you got to grow them

762
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,000
finish them dry them cure them smoke

763
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:14,000
them

764
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,480
then make your final decision a lot of

765
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
times i'll grow in larger batches of 10

766
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,599
i had some commercial facilities going

767
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,640
where we could grow larger numbers you'd

768
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:23,199
grow quite a few

769
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,240
you'd narrow it down to the top two

770
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,640
three maybe the top

771
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,558
five and grow those again because the

772
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,640
first time we just did a sample run

773
00:22:28,558 --> 00:22:32,158
didn't do anything fancy we just did a

774
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,799
phenol hunt everything got the same

775
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,320
treatment

776
00:22:32,798 --> 00:22:35,918
now we know that that one plant could

777
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:36,879
have used more calmag that one likes

778
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:39,360
more nitrogen

779
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:41,600
so we'll run the top three or five again

780
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:43,759
and see which one stands out from that

781
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:45,439
dry them cure them smoke them do it all

782
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:47,279
over again so sometimes

783
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,038
i can call them early if they're funky

784
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:52,079
if they're ugly not doing what i want

785
00:22:49,038 --> 00:22:52,720
they gotta go early uh sometimes middle

786
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:55,119
of veg

787
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,038
sometimes early flower sometimes laden

788
00:22:55,119 --> 00:22:59,839
flower it just kind of depends

789
00:22:57,038 --> 00:23:01,839
uh a lot of times i will make it's more

790
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:03,918
uh more common for me to make decisions

791
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:05,918
on what i really want to keep

792
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:07,440
uh kind of laid in veg i can see it i

793
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:08,880
just oh i like the structure of that

794
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,919
little girl right there that plant's

795
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,520
gonna be a boy

796
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:13,038
i'm gonna put them in a room together

797
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:14,639
those are gonna be beautiful

798
00:23:13,038 --> 00:23:16,400
sometimes i can just see it i just get a

799
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,840
hint i just get a vibe i get a feeling

800
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,720
from these plants

801
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:22,319
sometimes however we've gotta smoke them

802
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,159
and sit in a room and go

803
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:26,000
man number three tastes really good but

804
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:27,360
number four gives me a really good buzz

805
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,279
but number five

806
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:30,798
really produced a lot more so you got

807
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:31,599
things to think about as a commercial

808
00:23:30,798 --> 00:23:34,079
grower

809
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:34,879
so sometimes we don't know until the end

810
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,558
then

811
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,400
then let me go even a step further

812
00:23:36,558 --> 00:23:40,319
sometimes we don't know until we have

813
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,880
extracted it what's the purpose of this

814
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:42,798
plant

815
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,080
i'm a dabber i like to smoke batters and

816
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:46,158
concentrates

817
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:48,240
why not do some extraction and then

818
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:49,520
decide which one makes the best extracts

819
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,440
maybe that flavor

820
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:52,639
and that potency maybe they switch

821
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,080
places once you run it through the

822
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,038
extraction equipment maybe the one that

823
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:56,879
tasted better

824
00:23:55,038 --> 00:23:58,558
is now more potent maybe the one that

825
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,679
was more potent now tastes better after

826
00:23:58,558 --> 00:24:02,079
you run it through the extraction

827
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:04,080
equipment maybe one phenotype

828
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:05,759
really dumps out the trichomes and puts

829
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:07,359
out a lot of concentrates when you press

830
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:08,480
it squish it wash it run it whatever

831
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:10,639
you're gonna do

832
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,240
then if that's our goal that will be our

833
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:15,200
phenotypical selection there

834
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,798
so um that i know that's a really

835
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,798
open-ended answer

836
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:20,720
uh but also let me add even more onto

837
00:24:18,798 --> 00:24:24,158
that long-winded open-ended answer

838
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,960
sometimes um so you said for a breeding

839
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:26,960
program

840
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,558
we are simply selecting plants that are

841
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,440
going to be bred with we're looking for

842
00:24:28,558 --> 00:24:31,918
the boy

843
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,519
um i have a really tight criteria on

844
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:35,200
looking for boys i've talked about

845
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:36,879
i can eliminate boys quickly if they

846
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,720
don't fit my criteria i know more

847
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,000
what doesn't fit for boys i could just

848
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,200
be like no that's not going to work

849
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,599
that's not going to work

850
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,278
so we've got our boys in one room now

851
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:46,959
that's a different uh conversation we've

852
00:24:45,278 --> 00:24:47,919
got our girls we smoke and finish the

853
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,840
girls

854
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:51,278
now we've got three females that we're

855
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:52,639
considering pollinating with our

856
00:24:51,278 --> 00:24:55,599
selected male

857
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,919
now we've got to pollinate and grow them

858
00:24:55,599 --> 00:24:58,319
and

859
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:59,600
then see which of those phenotypes

860
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:01,759
produce the best

861
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:03,839
offspring that's where we are now with

862
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:05,919
the jack the ripper f2 i pollinated

863
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:07,519
multiple females with one male

864
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:09,600
i've sent it out that sent out the

865
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:11,519
testers with clear indicators there's

866
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:12,879
numbers uh two four and five

867
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:14,240
and possibly number three i don't know

868
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,120
if number three has been sent out for

869
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,558
testing yet

870
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:18,158
uh it just didn't look like one of the

871
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:19,519
keepers i did not keep that one for

872
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:21,600
continued generations

873
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:23,918
but uh we sent out two four and five for

874
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:26,558
testing and now we will find out if

875
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:27,038
the jack the ripper from this male one

876
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:28,960
male

877
00:25:27,038 --> 00:25:31,038
pollinated multiple females will find

878
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,720
out which of the females performs better

879
00:25:31,038 --> 00:25:34,440
and we'll put those to market maybe i'll

880
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:38,000
put both of them out we'll call it

881
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:40,080
jtrf2 number four and jtrf2 number two

882
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,240
and we'll simply market both of them

883
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:44,000
maybe we'll do some inbreeding like we

884
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,359
talked about on a previous episode

885
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,440
i am going to correct some of those

886
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:49,759
terms we spoke of also

887
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:51,759
but sometimes i don't make my final

888
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:54,319
selections until i see

889
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:55,839
what the seeds do that come from that so

890
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:56,639
right now i've got the jack the ripper

891
00:25:55,839 --> 00:25:58,720
number two

892
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,919
and number four female on deck in a grow

893
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,319
space somewhere

894
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:04,480
once we determine which progeny is

895
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:06,000
better i'll call one of those and i'll

896
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,038
keep the one that makes the best

897
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,000
offspring

898
00:26:07,038 --> 00:26:11,119
so um that has gone really far the

899
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,079
plants have been

900
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:15,359
uh dried cured smoked then regrown

901
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:18,720
pollinated

902
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:20,479
um tested and they are still in testing

903
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,720
once the testing batches some of the

904
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,319
first rounds of the blueberry cookies

905
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,079
to jack the ripper and jack the ripper

906
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:27,599
f2s are coming down this week and being

907
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:28,798
tested i'm super excited for that

908
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:29,918
they're coming down and getting smoked

909
00:26:28,798 --> 00:26:31,679
really soon

910
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:34,000
once they get smoked and we decide which

911
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:35,679
one was better then i can eliminate the

912
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,240
parent of the one i don't like the most

913
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:38,720
so

914
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,079
there were multiple cycles gone through

915
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,200
while i kept both of those parents

916
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:43,038
around just to see

917
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,519
which worked best you guys that's why

918
00:26:43,038 --> 00:26:47,038
seeds are not super cheap sometimes

919
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:48,639
it looks like we're just making two

920
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:49,519
plants [ __ ] but there's a lot of

921
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,600
selection going

922
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:53,918
when it's done properly there's a lot of

923
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:55,678
care selection preparation into it

924
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:57,038
then there's time to make the seeds

925
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:58,559
after the seeds are made they've got to

926
00:26:57,038 --> 00:27:00,879
be separated sorted

927
00:26:58,558 --> 00:27:03,599
sorted packaged sent out tested

928
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:05,200
thoroughly thoroughly tested

929
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:06,639
i pay for every package i sent out to

930
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,240
test out of my pocket that's

931
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,080
eight bucks worth of shipping every time

932
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,880
a package goes out i sent out a lot of

933
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:13,439
those

934
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:15,200
uh they got to be tested then we've got

935
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,558
to market them then you got to repackage

936
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,600
them up for sales you got to send them

937
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:18,960
out to the vendors

938
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:20,319
uh then you got to make more seeds

939
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,679
because once they're tested people see

940
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:22,158
the pictures from the testers they get

941
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:23,519
hot

942
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:25,360
that's why seeds are not cheap because

943
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:26,558
there's a lot of work that goes on in

944
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:27,759
the background we don't just get two

945
00:27:26,558 --> 00:27:29,599
plants to make them [ __ ] and put out

946
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:30,960
seeds if we're doing it correctly

947
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:33,519
there's a lot of forethought a lot of

948
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:35,759
testing a lot of r d goes into it

949
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:37,839
um let's see where are we on this i

950
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:40,000
think i answered most of this one

951
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:42,000
sometimes i call them early sometimes in

952
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,880
veg sometimes in flowers sometimes you

953
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,798
gotta smoke them

954
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,919
sometimes you gotta dab them sometimes

955
00:27:44,798 --> 00:27:47,918
you gotta breed with them

956
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:50,480
see which one works the best then keep

957
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:52,399
the keeper get rid of the non-keeper

958
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,079
sometimes i'll do that with a male also

959
00:27:52,398 --> 00:27:54,798
when i was looking for solomon i went

960
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:57,119
through

961
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:58,960
a lot of seeds to find solomon i was

962
00:27:57,119 --> 00:28:00,558
really picky i didn't see what i wanted

963
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,558
exactly in a male plant

964
00:28:00,558 --> 00:28:03,759
finally i found it and i feel like i

965
00:28:02,558 --> 00:28:04,480
made the right selection you guys

966
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:07,759
because

967
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:09,200
solomon is a bad mo fro all right ladies

968
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:11,119
and gentlemen boys and girls pimps and

969
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,880
hoes friends and foes smokers growers

970
