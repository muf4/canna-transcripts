a grower myself and another friend we

saw a comedian called Todd Johnson

58
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:18,650
called Johnson I sound like an Asian guy

59
00:05:14,389 --> 00:05:22,039
when you saw the community name Todd

60
00:05:18,649 --> 00:05:24,109
Johnson who's gonna clean for my taste

61
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:25,760
he's kind of good old boy comedy you

62
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:28,280
said nasty on the right there so I was

63
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,550
really expecting dirty comedy works is

64
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:32,549
hooking me up I've gone to a lot

65
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:34,290
comedy works shows and they see my email

66
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:35,550
address on a lot of [ __ ] so they called

67
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:37,110

68
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:38,790
tickets to a bunch of shows or you can

69
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:41,460
get $5 tickets to a bunch of their shows

70
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:43,140
and they do it just to fill the seats is

71
00:05:41,459 --> 00:05:44,399
when they're trying to do that and I see

72
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:47,189
why now that we got there why that

73
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:49,469
counts or that comedy show is $5 but uh

74
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:51,300

75
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:53,820
dirty I know it's something dirty or a

76
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:55,590
little filthy the opening act

77
00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:57,269
there was a host who I always forget his

78
00:05:55,589 --> 00:05:58,679
name it's Ron something and I feel bad

79
00:05:57,269 --> 00:06:01,859
that I forget his name he's a comedian

80
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:04,170
well-known for doing dabs dab jokes weed

81
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:09,500
jokes he's pretty funny he's a good host

82
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:14,520
he's better at being a host comedy group

83
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:23,819
dude sorry bro but I'm six five

84
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:24,839
everybody's [ __ ] pretty sure he's a

85
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:35,540
real friendly looking for these a

86
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:37,169
comedian man from Denver that were

87
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:41,340
[ __ ] hilarious

88
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:49,470
and did some awesome jokes and actually

89
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:51,179
tipped him with some goodies because the

90
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:52,890
host following him was a guy named

91
00:06:51,180 --> 00:07:03,180
Deacon gray right was a comedian before

92
00:06:52,889 --> 00:07:04,620
Deacon gray yeah Deacon gray came out if

93
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:07,189
you guys don't know Deacon gray Deacon

94
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:10,980
gray is a Denver local as far as I know

95
00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:12,810
he's funny as [ __ ] hilarious dude and

96
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:15,300
he's had time to calm down he's not a

97
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:17,730
hyper kid and he's got his delivery is

98
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:19,860
flawless he doesn't look like he's up

99
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:21,180
there performing he's up there having as

100
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:22,889
much fun as we are

101
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:24,930
and he did quite a bit of high humor too

102
00:07:22,889 --> 00:07:26,729
and I mean that's that's not easy I mean

103
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:29,100
it seems easy to write jokes about pot

104
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:30,720
but it's you know right and it has to be

105
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:33,750
in Denver now there's the thing where

106
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,569
everybody's a pot comic so you can't be

107
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:37,699
a Paco McHugh have to have

108
00:07:35,569 --> 00:07:39,199
you can throw in your pot set for when

109
00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:43,038
the crowd right is there it wasn't it

110
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:44,929
rely on that because it wasn't about pot

111
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:48,468
it was more about the high humor you

112
00:07:44,928 --> 00:07:52,038
know about being it was about my weed

113
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:53,478
for cheap great I recommend that dude

114
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:57,490
check him out if you can see him go see

115
00:07:53,478 --> 00:07:59,990
him I didn't do any research on that

116
00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:01,819
also a big shout out to Melissa from

117
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:04,639

127
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:40,278
64 degrees I've been used to being like

128
00:08:38,448 --> 00:08:42,978
85 90 and then I walked up here and it

129
00:08:40,278 --> 00:08:46,220
was 60 64 shivering it was kind of weird

130
00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:48,410
anyway random talk on the show sorry so

131
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:50,089
before we get too far this is a

132
00:08:48,409 --> 00:08:51,528
celebration show but we have something

133
00:08:50,089 --> 00:08:53,509
really awesome to add to this

134
00:08:51,528 --> 00:08:56,360
celebration I'm excited to announce that

135
00:08:53,509 --> 00:09:00,938
mark Emery is home in Canada with his

136
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:00,938
wife Jodi congratulations

137
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:06,199
you know the mark Emery was arrested and

138
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:07,789
held and in an American federal prison

139
00:09:06,198 --> 00:09:10,039
for distributing cannabis seeds to trust

140
00:09:07,789 --> 00:09:11,240
the world most listeners the show would

141
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:13,549
agree that mark was in prison for

142
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:14,750
complete [ __ ] so I think it's great

143
00:09:13,549 --> 00:09:16,429
to know that he's back home with his

144
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:18,860
family where he belongs he's cuddled up

145
00:09:16,429 --> 00:09:21,078
was with his wife saw a picture of him

146
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:22,639
smoking a joint with some people I saw a

147
00:09:21,078 --> 00:09:24,559
picture of him hugging up on his wife

148
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:26,870
that's what a man should be doing you

149
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:28,309
shouldn't be locked up and he's right

150
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:31,068
back on the fight I don't know if you've

151
00:09:28,309 --> 00:09:33,438
watched any video oh he's right up there

152
00:09:31,068 --> 00:09:33,979
and I never really noticed that he spoke

153
00:09:33,438 --> 00:09:36,110
with a whisk

154
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:38,720
maybe he has a retainer or something but

155
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:40,579
it really was pronounced when he like

156
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,050
when he very first step back into Canada

157
00:09:40,578 --> 00:09:43,578
and got in front of the microphone I

158
00:09:42,049 --> 00:09:45,139
don't remember that

159
00:09:43,578 --> 00:09:46,609
I can I can link you to the video I

160
00:09:45,139 --> 00:09:48,149
always remember him going on and on for

161
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:49,470
days me too and I'm

162
00:09:48,149 --> 00:09:51,149
that's something that I I never really

163
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:55,370
noticed but he's right back on it and

164
00:09:51,149 --> 00:10:00,289
his wife's gunning for liberal liberal

165
00:09:55,370 --> 00:10:00,289
some kind of liberal office up there for

166
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:04,740
good good it's good to see him back on

167
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:06,899
it that was quick so big love and much

168
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:08,580
respect to mark and Jodie Emery I did a

169
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:10,649
little bit of checking it out mark was

170
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:15,120
taken into federal prison on September

171
00:10:10,649 --> 00:10:19,829
10th 2010 he was released July 9th 2014

172
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:23,120
I used Siri I used a calculator I just

173
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:26,460
asked Siri how many days was that it's

174
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:28,080
1398 days in federal prison plus the

175
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:30,480
time he was locked up while awaiting

176
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:32,340
trial the time during the trial and a

177
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:38,300
couple of weeks in limbo after he was

178
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:41,759
released from federal prison 1398 days

179
00:10:38,299 --> 00:10:44,959
Adam you look speechless are you

180
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:51,899
familiar with that sort of time period

181
00:10:44,960 --> 00:11:06,120
long time dude it's but I did three and

182
00:10:51,899 --> 00:11:07,439
then 54 and I felt like I mean that's

183
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,480
kind of what I was gonna ask this now

184
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,120
that he's pregnant he was the principal

185
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:18,389
before he came in now yeah does he knock

186
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:20,220
re-and off his king throne that's close

187
00:11:18,389 --> 00:11:23,909
to four years though in federal prison

188
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:26,460
that's 46 months 200 weeks so imagine

189
00:11:23,909 --> 00:11:35,100
your life being disrupted for 200 weeks

190
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:37,200
he'd be in prison that's cool

191
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:41,670
mine was a county jail not federal

192
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:47,670
prisoner level even like that's amazing

193
00:11:41,669 --> 00:11:50,219
and I'm glad he's free [ __ ]

194
00:11:47,669 --> 00:11:52,679
Georgia's [ __ ] charges it makes

195
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:54,000
awesome makes every seed breeder pot

196
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:54,729
grow or it makes us all a little bit

197
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,750
kind of

198
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:57,639
not only that what he was worried about

199
00:11:55,750 --> 00:12:00,028
ourselves before the rules have changed

200
00:11:57,639 --> 00:12:02,500
and now that they've changed you know I

201
00:12:00,028 --> 00:12:05,169
can just imagine the culture shock I

202
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:06,370
mean from where he was Markham or where

203
00:12:05,169 --> 00:12:08,708
he could probably puff on the street

204
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:10,000
anytime you wanted to but now in Canada

205
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:11,319
they don't really seem to care from what

206
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,889
people have told me they like come here

207
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:16,389
and smoke we don't really they don't

208
00:12:14,889 --> 00:12:17,799
talk about it like we do they don't get

209
00:12:16,389 --> 00:12:18,730
all hyped about it but they also don't

210
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:21,129
give a [ __ ] about it

211
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:23,079
all right so a big shout out to mark

future but we've been packing the show

217
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:32,709
it's been like an hour and 15 minutes

218
00:12:31,419 --> 00:12:33,789
sometimes and I don't feel like we need

219
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:37,078
to stretch it out with another gift

220
00:12:33,789 --> 00:12:37,078

221

223
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:46,660
keeping herself active in the movement

224
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:49,649
while we were down one soldier all right

225

228
00:12:56,799 --> 00:13:09,039
important make ending stuttering all the

229
00:13:07,659 --> 00:13:11,679
contests we have started on the show

231
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:15,429
contests open-ended and I've been

232
00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:17,500
waiting for answers do a few like

233
00:13:15,429 --> 00:13:19,000
questions and stuff like that I think

234
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,708
those episodes have gotten old and the

235
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,039
giveaways have just faded away so I want

236
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:25,659
to reuse the prizes so I'll end all the

237
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:29,259
contests that are happening now on the

238
00:13:25,659 --> 00:13:33,879
podcast August 17th at 11:15 59 p.m.

239
00:13:29,259 --> 00:13:35,620

240
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:37,750
for future contests and giveaways to

241
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:39,519
look forward to that I just wanted to

242
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:41,379
make an official ending date on those

243
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:43,690
contests so that when I do reuse those

244
00:13:41,379 --> 00:13:47,679
prizes nobody can get mad if they try to

245
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:50,420
go win the old contests official [ __ ]

246

264
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:30,250
still I'm trying brother I'm trying to

265

266
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:36,769
harvest so you just roll a bunch you

267

some well then you'll get your nicotine

269
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:49,009
fit that way and then just slowly take

270
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:53,259
the nicotine out I can just quit my

271
00:15:49,009 --> 00:15:53,259
problem is her smoking next to me

272
00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:00,040
doesn't want to quit then she doesn't

273
00:15:58,029 --> 00:16:02,709
want to so I'm trying to I told her to

274
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:17,529
get a get a pin and just smoke wax you

275
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:19,509
know like you wanna say we have a

276
00:16:17,529 --> 00:16:20,740
platform to give a review you're tied up

277
00:16:19,509 --> 00:16:23,529
in the headphone cable so you're gonna

278
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:24,549
be stuck for life now go ahead and go

279
00:16:23,529 --> 00:16:27,309
ahead and tell him the name of the thing

280
00:16:24,549 --> 00:16:35,289
and then I hit it once I'll tell you my

281
00:16:27,309 --> 00:16:38,529
opinion it's the company is neos in my

282
00:16:35,289 --> 00:16:40,449
opinion it's an easier draw and better

283
00:16:38,529 --> 00:16:48,069
tasting and more effective than some of

284
00:16:40,450 --> 00:17:15,720
the other companies to try out to see if

285
00:16:48,070 --> 00:17:19,539
you know it's a good product it is not

286
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:22,750
it's not dad kid dabs but if you're if

287
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:26,109
you're looking for a vape pen yes it's

288
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:27,279
it's really attractive is that okay so

289
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:34,509
you just replace the cartridge on the

290
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:38,049
end okay cool

291
00:17:34,509 --> 00:17:39,759
and the very end of it is a stylus if I

292
00:17:38,049 --> 00:17:41,799
were if I were a wreck patient what

293
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:43,900
would that cost me we haven't started

294
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:45,940
carrying them yet so I'm not sure but

295
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:48,460
similar companies with smaller batteries

296
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:50,920
like I said that aren't as great starter

297
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:55,120
package is about 58 dollars and some

298
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:57,910
change for a small cartridge just a 150

299
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:59,199
milligrams cartridge and a battery you

300
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,460
don't have to replace the battery you

301
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,140
can recharge it

302
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:03,700
you just have to come get cartridges and

303
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:06,700
they make them in three different sizes

304
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:08,080
but these ones that were these new ones

305
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:18,308
that we're testing out we're probably

306
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:19,509
gonna start carrying those different

307
00:18:18,308 --> 00:18:20,799
high from it we've been dabbing for a

308
00:18:19,509 --> 00:18:29,410
while and I just took another rip off

309
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:32,139
there and my high changed some fur packs

310
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:41,080
of course I might have friends at Archer

311
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:46,929
pecks or the guys but those are the guys

312
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:51,789
I know it's definitely a very attractive

313
00:18:46,929 --> 00:18:53,860
like I mean why not why not get

314
00:18:51,789 --> 00:18:56,440
something like that and fill it full you

315
00:18:53,859 --> 00:18:57,699
know of wax that she'll hit maybe she

316
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:09,279
probably won't clear the damn thing in a

317
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:12,429
week you know last your wife a week it's

318
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:14,950
very smooth you don't have to push a

319
00:19:12,429 --> 00:19:16,690
button you know it's simple it's like I

320
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:26,590
said you wear it with the black shirt

321
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:27,940
it's I didn't even see it you know I got

322
00:19:26,589 --> 00:19:31,058
a message on facebook from a listener

323
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:34,690
named Fred and ironically he was asking

324
00:19:31,058 --> 00:19:35,889
me to talk about acquiring seeds it's

325
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:38,970
really great because this email came

326
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:41,290
today while I was preparing for the show

327
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:45,819
sorry excuse my cough guys that's from

328
00:19:41,289 --> 00:19:47,529
dabs that's from big dabs so I want to

329
00:19:45,819 --> 00:19:49,869
talk about acquiring seeds but before I

330
00:19:47,529 --> 00:19:52,420
do that let me give a little bit of a

331
00:19:49,869 --> 00:19:54,969
legal disclaimer because we don't want

332
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:56,830
to be the next mark ever it may be a

333
00:19:54,970 --> 00:20:01,170
label to acquire cannabis seeds in your

334
00:19:56,829 --> 00:20:01,169
location is your responsibility

335
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:09,509
I'm not even gonna try to edit any of

336
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:12,240
that it is your responsibility to know

337
00:20:09,509 --> 00:20:13,950
the laws in your location any company

338
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,870
online that will send you seeds is only

339
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:19,169
sending them to you for souvenir

340
00:20:15,869 --> 00:20:21,689
purposes germinating seeds germinate

341
00:20:19,169 --> 00:20:23,850
cannabis seeds is illegal in most places

342
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:25,980
I'm not here to help you break the law

343
00:20:23,849 --> 00:20:27,689
if you decide to buy and/or germinate

344
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:32,339
cannabis seeds I cannot be responsible

345
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:34,409
for you I live in Colorado this is

346
00:20:32,339 --> 00:20:36,720
legalized most of my advice is for

347
00:20:34,409 --> 00:20:39,539
Colorado California Oregon Washington or

348
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:41,278
Michigan residents be careful and don't

349
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:43,619
get your ass into trouble because I'm

350
00:20:41,278 --> 00:20:48,259
not a lawyer and I'm not responsible I'm

351
00:20:43,619 --> 00:20:48,259
simply the host of a badass podcast

352
00:20:49,579 --> 00:20:57,480
because if you're ordering seeds you

353
00:20:55,019 --> 00:21:01,230
must be 18 or 21 and you got to be

354
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:10,860
responsible you have to be smart know

355
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:14,069
the rules where you are but still do

356
00:21:10,859 --> 00:21:17,009
that [ __ ] here's what I can tell you

357
00:21:14,069 --> 00:21:21,178
about acquiring yourself some seeds

358
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:30,119
yourself acquiring some seeds quality

359
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:40,850
seeds from reputable breeders I mean

360
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:40,849
I've only heard a few and of course

361
00:21:41,569 --> 00:22:04,619
that's that's me of course old guys who

362
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:06,450
really paved the way and helped a lot of

363
00:22:04,619 --> 00:22:08,289
the new seed readers get good genetics

364
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:09,910
to breed with

365
00:22:08,289 --> 00:22:12,609
so you can't take anything away from

366
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:16,060
those guys but I mean some of the I read

367
00:22:12,609 --> 00:22:17,769
genetics will applaud labs gauge Green

368
00:22:16,059 --> 00:22:19,240
genetics like they're all doing some

369
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:21,069
really awesome stuff and they're

370
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:22,599
thinking about what they're crossing and

371
00:22:21,069 --> 00:22:25,839
what they're trying to get out of their

372
00:22:22,599 --> 00:22:27,669
crosses and not just finding a good

373
00:22:25,839 --> 00:22:30,819
phenotype they're actually looking for

374
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:33,519
flavor profiles and cannabinoid profiles

375
00:22:30,819 --> 00:22:36,159
and they're getting what they want out

376
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:38,740
of it and a lot of that has to do with

377
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:41,410
the way they do things a lot of the new

378
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:43,720
seed breeders are really community

379
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:45,820
friendly and dispersing a lot of seeds -

380
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:49,269
a lot of people and allowing them to

381
00:22:45,819 --> 00:22:51,789
perform their methods of growing and

382
00:22:49,269 --> 00:22:54,160
find you know different there's an

383
00:22:51,789 --> 00:22:56,409
occasional plants there's an occasional

384
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:59,740
secret meeting at a place in Denver

385
00:22:56,410 --> 00:23:05,259
where a few of us are chosen to meet at

386
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:08,410
this mansion shout out to the caves

387
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:10,420
there since it egos alpha chronic shows

388
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:12,519
up a bunch of us breeders IRA Genetics

389
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:14,380
goes and we all take packages of our

390
00:23:12,519 --> 00:23:18,789
newest [ __ ] or whatever our secret

391
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:21,580
weapon and we trade and like Mile High

392
00:23:18,789 --> 00:23:24,339
has given me as Apollo x brothers Hayes

393
00:23:21,579 --> 00:23:25,839
and I gave him my grateful dog you know

394
00:23:24,339 --> 00:23:28,779
like just trade packs of seeds around

395
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:30,699
the table and we all yeah we try to keep

396
00:23:28,779 --> 00:23:31,930
it together with each other instead of

397
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:33,789
trying to compete we're trying to be

398
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:35,230
like what her brothers some faceoff og

399
00:23:33,789 --> 00:23:41,230
for some heart of gold

400
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:41,799
you know like barter that's right that's

401
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:44,009
right

402
00:23:41,799 --> 00:23:46,779
so that's a few of our favorite breeders

403
00:23:44,009 --> 00:23:47,950
buy some seeds from reputable breeders I

404
00:23:46,779 --> 00:23:50,829
I'm a breeder

405
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:52,410
I am I region etics I would say since

406
00:23:50,829 --> 00:23:55,659
it's hard to get I read genetics seeds

407
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:57,490
gage Green is one of my favorites I use

408
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:59,140
gage green for breeding stuff if you're

409
00:23:57,490 --> 00:24:00,670
gonna if you want to get into a breeding

410
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:01,930
stuff and you want a reliable male I

411
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:03,460
can't believe I'm [ __ ] telling the

412
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:05,080
world this but gage green is a good

413
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:07,240
place to find a nice reliable male

414
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:09,009
that's true [ __ ] right there

415
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:10,880
that's how friendly I am

416
00:24:09,009 --> 00:24:12,200
but be careful with your breeding

417
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,970
because you can still [ __ ] up even with

418
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:17,028
that good mail so much I like you guys

419
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:18,470
you listen to my show it's awesome so

420
00:24:17,028 --> 00:24:19,940
bag seeds are fun but they're not as

421
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:22,788
reliable bag seeds are seeds that you

422
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:24,980
find in wheat of course right they're

423
00:24:22,788 --> 00:24:27,440
not as reliable as something you'd find

424
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:28,909
you want something with specific Paris

425
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,200
bread for certain traits like Kevin was

426
00:24:28,909 --> 00:24:32,570
saying earlier so it's kind of cool that

427
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,919
he touched on that your first option is

428
00:24:32,569 --> 00:24:35,569
bag seed that [ __ ] that you of course

429
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:37,038
found in that cush that you bought from

430
00:24:35,569 --> 00:24:39,379
that guy in the park and it had a seed

431
00:24:37,038 --> 00:24:41,240
grow that out see what happens but keep

432
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:43,309
a close eye on any bag seed because it

433
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:53,120
could be a male or it could be a

434
00:24:43,308 --> 00:24:56,028
hermaphrodite yep you can possibly get

435
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:57,648
seed at a dispensary or a co-op many of

436
00:24:56,028 --> 00:24:59,839
the shops in California Colorado

437
00:24:57,648 --> 00:25:02,119
Washington and Michigan have seeds from

438
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:03,980
reputable reputable breeders available

439
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:06,109

Colorado you can pick up yourself some

444
00:25:14,419 --> 00:25:24,740
rare dankness genetics because our

445
00:25:20,569 --> 00:25:26,178

449
00:25:30,259 --> 00:25:34,009
there's seeds on shops and shelves I was

450
00:25:32,538 --> 00:25:35,869
reading I forgot there we go

451
00:25:34,009 --> 00:25:37,970
you can also pick up seeds cannabis

452
00:25:35,869 --> 00:25:39,558
events like the Cannabis Cup in Hempfest

453
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:41,450
or whatever else is happening this month

454
00:25:39,558 --> 00:25:44,240
because there seems to be an event every

455
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:46,038
damn month now the breeders go they set

456
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,899
up a tent do a little bit of research

457
00:25:46,038 --> 00:25:49,609
online look what you're find out what

458
00:25:47,898 --> 00:25:52,099
you're looking for find out what you

459
00:25:49,609 --> 00:25:53,569
should be paying expect to pay about a

460
00:25:52,099 --> 00:25:57,139
hundred bucks for a ten pack of seeds

461
00:25:53,569 --> 00:25:58,788
honestly between 60 and 120 but about a

462
00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:01,850
hundred bucks for a ten pack of seeds so

463
00:25:58,788 --> 00:26:03,679
before you go to the events go and find

464
00:26:01,849 --> 00:26:04,939
out what you want and then go there and

465
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:06,200
see if you can find those breeders and

466
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:08,808
you'll have a little shopping done it'll

467
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:10,759
be a little easier for you but those are

468
00:26:08,808 --> 00:26:12,379
only viable options if you live in or if

469
00:26:10,759 --> 00:26:14,690
you can travel to a legal state like

470
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:16,760
Colorado or Hempfest which is happening

471
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:20,720
right now will be over by the time you

472
00:26:16,759 --> 00:26:21,940
hear this sorry be an option for most of

473
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,799
you guys so in this case

474
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:26,730
you're gonna need to order your seeds

475
00:26:23,799 --> 00:26:29,230
online if you're the United States I

476
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:31,960
strongly recommend nature's green

477
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:33,549
remedies calm my company has a great

478
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:35,319
working relationship with nature's green

479
00:26:33,549 --> 00:26:36,639
remedies I'm friends with most of the

480
00:26:35,319 --> 00:26:38,919
breeder stocked on nature's green

481
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,450
remedies and I trust everyone that I've

482
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:42,220
done business with involved with

483
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:44,110
nature's green remedies so I strongly

484
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:46,690
recommend nature's green remedies calm

485
00:26:44,109 --> 00:26:48,699
for seeds in the US like I said expect

486
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:51,759
to pay around $100 for a 10 pack of

487
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:53,019
seeds sometimes you get a 12-pack some

488
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:55,210
brands are a little cheaper some are

489
00:26:53,019 --> 00:26:56,769
slightly higher feminized seeds often

490
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:58,720
run a little more expensive because

491
00:26:56,769 --> 00:27:01,299
they're harder to produce you get way

492
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:03,339
less feminized seeds out of a breeding

493
00:27:01,299 --> 00:27:04,839
project than you do regular seeds it

494
00:27:03,339 --> 00:27:07,209
takes more time it takes more space it

495
00:27:04,839 --> 00:27:10,179
takes more energy so of course we want

496
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:12,130
more money for that I do not charge my

497
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:13,870
regular seeds my feminized seeds are the

498
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,760
same price I charge the same price all

499

milestone in the podcast world they say

636
00:34:37,789 --> 00:34:42,019
that your show isn't anywhere until

you've done 25 episodes they don't

your belt and I do have to give a little

643

bit of respect to the podcast that

644
00:34:55,398 --> 00:34:59,750
helped me get my feet wet and learn how

645
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:01,490
to do podcasting it was simple one-line

646
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:02,480

treatment the only bad news we received

711
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:55,190
was the original cancer so cannabis has

712
00:37:52,579 --> 00:37:58,819
done a lot for the man he's made sure

713

doing a proper and mad love for that

759
00:41:05,079 --> 00:41:10,509

00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:26,500
something like this guy the whole seed

767
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:28,960
topic today just happened to be good

768
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:30,909
timing I had a giveaway planned and that

769
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:32,409
guy asked about where to get seeds so

770
00:41:30,909 --> 00:41:37,659
now hopefully he's listening to episode

771
00:41:32,409 --> 00:41:39,609
25 and he can get seeds to buy some IRA

772
00:41:37,659 --> 00:41:43,869
genetics products right now I think his

773
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:46,240
email said he's in California he's got

774
00:41:43,869 --> 00:41:48,429
that 215 and it's legal out there good

775
00:41:46,239 --> 00:41:50,919
deal but he doesn't have to even buy IRA

776
00:41:48,429 --> 00:41:54,219
genetics products you can go buy some

777

00:43:14,090 --> 00:44:22,160
try to read those on a future episode on

792
00:43:59,530 --> 00:44:25,970
including in under certain code things

793
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:29,358
like that but now they're out long even

794
00:44:25,969 --> 00:44:34,129
that in Colorado Springs and what

795
00:44:29,358 --> 00:44:36,848
apparently what it was some one one guy

796
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:39,489
from I forget his name from the

797
00:44:36,849 --> 00:44:43,989
building some building department or

798
00:44:39,489 --> 00:44:46,478
something in Springs kind of decided

799
00:44:43,989 --> 00:44:48,940
that you know these electrical codes and

800
00:44:46,478 --> 00:44:53,679
certain things were not sufficient to

801
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:55,389
even have a closed loop so here you know

802
00:44:53,679 --> 00:44:58,690
here the industry is there's a lot of

803
00:44:55,389 --> 00:45:01,960
people you know making new new rooms and

804
00:44:58,690 --> 00:45:04,960
everything under all these new codes all

805
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:06,999
these guidelines and this guy just came

806
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:09,429
in and said that wasn't good enough and

807
00:45:06,998 --> 00:45:12,248
apparently this department has like

808
00:45:09,429 --> 00:45:21,940
final say over fire department all this

809
00:45:12,248 --> 00:45:25,778
other stuff they're working to figure it

810
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:30,099
out and you know I think the guy from

811
00:45:25,778 --> 00:45:32,349
what I understand is going to tell you

812
00:45:30,099 --> 00:45:36,729
know the industry what he wants as

813
00:45:32,349 --> 00:45:48,400
regulations or whatever and you know it

814
00:45:36,728 --> 00:45:50,798
may be like it just happened yesterday

815
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:55,778
afternoon so let's do you know how many

816
00:45:50,798 --> 00:45:57,429
extraction amol so this is blasting is

817
00:45:55,778 --> 00:45:59,829
actually technically illegal anyway this

818
00:45:57,429 --> 00:46:02,618
is only relating to dispensary OPC

819
00:45:59,829 --> 00:46:04,479
Grosso state regulated any deregulated

820
00:46:02,619 --> 00:46:05,950
grows that are blasting their pry it's

821
00:46:04,478 --> 00:46:09,179
not even blasting anymore at this point

822
00:46:05,949 --> 00:46:12,879
it's processing in a closed loop system

823
00:46:09,179 --> 00:46:15,460
legal Emme deregulated MIPS OPC

824
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:17,200
regulated blasting sites processing

825
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:19,088
facilities I guess we'll call them how

826
00:46:17,199 --> 00:46:22,298
many of those do you think or know of in

827
00:46:19,088 --> 00:46:24,940
Colorado Springs I I know of two for

828
00:46:22,298 --> 00:46:27,699
sure I know there's probably a couple

829
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:30,429
more just because some of the you know

830
00:46:27,699 --> 00:46:32,379
dispensaries have their own mips

831
00:46:30,429 --> 00:46:35,440
licenses yeah that they can process

832
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:37,550
under but i know two of for sure and

833
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:48,289
once fairly new to colorado

834
00:46:37,550 --> 00:46:50,870
and that's kind of a bummer and it's

835
00:46:48,289 --> 00:46:54,550
getting shut down now which is you know

836
00:46:50,869 --> 00:46:54,549
that's they can still run their garden

837
00:46:55,150 --> 00:47:02,720
run co2 you can still run the garden

838
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:04,940
that we're talking about it

839
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:07,309
okay garden in spring so it was actually

840
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:08,510
being grown so what happens guys if

841
00:47:07,309 --> 00:47:11,829
you're listening from we've got a

842
00:47:08,510 --> 00:47:11,830
listener that listens in London

843
00:47:13,659 --> 00:47:18,739
everybody music yeah we have to keep in

844
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:22,550
mind that not everybody knows Colorado

845
00:47:18,739 --> 00:47:25,309
right these places grow a large Gardens

846
00:47:22,550 --> 00:47:27,289
like a thousand plants and they harvest

847
00:47:25,309 --> 00:47:30,230
the entire gardens and then they run all

848
00:47:27,289 --> 00:47:32,719
of that through a closed butane

849
00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:37,490
extraction machine and turn all of it

850
00:47:32,719 --> 00:47:40,730
into hash into BHO dabs process I want

851
00:47:37,489 --> 00:47:44,949
to concentrate yes and that sells for

852
00:47:40,730 --> 00:47:44,949
somewhere between depending on where and

853
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:50,750
if you're getting into live resin it's

854
00:47:47,809 --> 00:47:53,799
85 to 100 dollars a gram right so these

855
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:56,360
guys are making large portions and

856
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:58,190
portioning it up into grams and then

857
00:47:56,360 --> 00:48:00,320
they deliver it back to the dispensary

858
00:47:58,190 --> 00:48:02,090
and then the dispensary sells it or the

859
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:03,860
dispensary takes their grow that they

860
00:48:02,090 --> 00:48:06,320
have leftovers of and sends it to the

861
00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:08,960
extraction company for them to blast or

862
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:10,880
process and then they take all of that

863
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:12,889
product back to the shop and sell it on

864
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:15,710
the shelves so these guys are large

865
00:48:12,889 --> 00:48:17,989
large gardens just for processing so

866
00:48:15,710 --> 00:48:20,510
what I see them doing you run your large

867
00:48:17,989 --> 00:48:21,889
garden you chop it you dry it you drive

868
00:48:20,510 --> 00:48:23,450
it up to Denver to your processing

869
00:48:21,889 --> 00:48:25,279
facility or down to pueblo to your

870
00:48:23,449 --> 00:48:27,109
processing facility where it's legal and

871
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:39,200
then you run it there and then you just

872
00:48:27,110 --> 00:48:40,700
have to drive twice is what the industry

873
00:48:39,199 --> 00:48:42,449
standard is now you can't apply so

874
00:48:40,699 --> 00:48:44,489
that's that's what I'm saying

875
00:48:42,449 --> 00:48:47,608
this not doing anything but like

876
00:48:44,489 --> 00:48:49,078
upgrading the hash I mean it kind of

877
00:48:47,608 --> 00:48:50,759
sounds negative when it's coming from

878
00:48:49,079 --> 00:48:52,619
YouTube it to me it sounds like more

879
00:48:50,760 --> 00:49:01,920
people gonna be making unicorn hash and

880
00:48:52,619 --> 00:49:06,630
we're gonna go away from the butane it's

881
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:09,420
gonna drive the black market guys that

882
00:49:06,630 --> 00:49:10,829
are unlicensed like me I'm a grower and

883
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:14,369
I'm a breeder I don't I don't know how

884
00:49:10,829 --> 00:49:17,460
to make the dabs honestly I I'm going to

885
00:49:14,369 --> 00:49:19,079
have to if I can't get it's not being

886
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:35,690
made I'm going to have to go in my

887
00:49:19,079 --> 00:49:35,690
backyard and open blast my prohibition

888
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:57,559
banned all the recreational blasting I

889
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:57,559
[Music]

890
00:49:59,150 --> 00:50:04,950
think it's a great idea he pushed the

891
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:07,920
mountain regions back I'm sure it was a

892
00:50:04,949 --> 00:50:15,389
community decision to some extent wasn't

893
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:19,980
just big but they just wrapped up the

894
00:50:15,389 --> 00:50:22,139
East Coast most these Costa Bobby mugs

895
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:27,000
apparently that was badass good job I

896
00:50:22,139 --> 00:50:29,730
watched the video good job so after that

897
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:35,030
you know secret cup administrators

898
00:50:29,730 --> 00:50:40,980
decided that they needed the home states

899
00:50:35,030 --> 00:50:44,819
so Big D in Jeremy yeah as badass as the

900
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:46,469
beast coast was you know and they didn't

901
00:50:44,818 --> 00:50:47,969
feel like they could do that within like

902
00:50:46,469 --> 00:50:50,519
a week and a half

903
00:50:47,969 --> 00:50:57,509
and they have had several venue changes

904
00:50:50,519 --> 00:50:59,519
several issues with Denver yeah they're

905
00:50:57,510 --> 00:51:01,350
getting everything else squared away and

906
00:50:59,519 --> 00:51:15,420
they pushed it back to the end of

907
00:51:01,349 --> 00:51:18,599
September also a big d offer to pay any

908
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:20,369
expenses that were extra incurred on

909
00:51:18,599 --> 00:51:23,159
people who had already had plane tickets

910
00:51:20,369 --> 00:51:38,880
I had to trade a man or anything like

911
00:51:23,159 --> 00:51:41,009
that just prove to me what your airline

912
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:43,050
fees for changing tickets if there were

913
00:51:41,010 --> 00:51:47,670
you know it's awesome it was like that's

914
00:51:43,050 --> 00:51:48,900
that's pretty cool dude so yeah if you

915
00:51:47,670 --> 00:51:51,329

Thursday announced like the week yeah

1110
01:00:42,449 --> 01:00:46,829
new grower he's gonna new to Colorado

1111
01:00:44,460 --> 01:00:49,079
it's his first grow season here and he

1112
01:00:46,829 --> 01:00:50,819
does have some outdoor plants yeah well

1113
01:00:49,079 --> 01:00:52,170
I invited him to stick around while

1114
01:00:50,820 --> 01:00:53,700
Jesse's here he may have some good

1115
01:00:52,170 --> 01:00:55,470
outdoor questions he may bring up some

1116
01:00:53,699 --> 01:00:57,329
[ __ ] that we may overlook so it's always

1117
01:00:55,469 --> 01:01:00,358
good to have a new guy in to kind of

1118
01:00:57,329 --> 01:01:01,980
referee us because Ben told what kind of

1119
01:01:00,358 --> 01:01:03,509
snobs and we go a little fast and we

1120
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:05,639
talk about [ __ ] like everybody should

1121
01:01:03,510 --> 01:01:07,440
know so well slow down we'll try to go

1122
01:01:05,639 --> 01:01:09,150
slow for you guys and keep it at a pace

1123
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:10,590
where you can keep up but I do plan to

1124
01:01:09,150 --> 01:01:13,380
increase the knowledge in this show

1125
01:01:10,590 --> 01:01:16,858
slowly but surely over time so that you

1126
01:01:13,380 --> 01:01:18,809
guys can all improve that's right

1127
01:01:16,858 --> 01:01:21,029
knowledge is power that came from Adam

1128
01:01:18,809 --> 01:01:22,590
yeah never stop learning that might be

1129
01:01:21,030 --> 01:01:25,859
the smartest thing Adams gonna say all

1130
01:01:22,590 --> 01:01:27,059
day I said I was too loud in the

1131
01:01:25,858 --> 01:01:28,769
headphones I gotta turn that [ __ ] up now

1132
01:01:27,059 --> 01:01:29,670
you guys are crazy no you were too loud

1133
01:01:28,769 --> 01:01:31,559
my headphones

1134
01:01:29,670 --> 01:01:33,180
all right so of course we're back for an

1135
01:01:31,559 --> 01:01:35,009
outdoor girl lesson it's full bloom time

1136
01:01:33,179 --> 01:01:37,710
your plants should be starting to flower

1137
01:01:35,010 --> 01:01:39,390
you guys lookin rollin rocking and

1138
01:01:37,710 --> 01:01:41,099
rolling alright alright

1139
01:01:39,389 --> 01:01:42,299
signs a flower hopefully you guys have

1140
01:01:41,099 --> 01:01:49,019
pulled your mails it's time to pull the

1141
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:50,580
Mail's now right mails you've got a seed

1142
01:01:49,019 --> 01:01:51,989
crop and your neighbors have a seed crop

1143
01:01:50,579 --> 01:01:53,549
and someone else on the block has a seed

1144
01:01:51,989 --> 01:01:56,129
crop and they're all pissed off at you

1145
01:01:53,550 --> 01:01:57,420
so you [ __ ] up but hopefully pulled

1146
01:01:56,130 --> 01:01:59,070
your mails by now cuz you're in full

1147
01:01:57,420 --> 01:02:06,659
bloom so that means we're probably 25 30

1148
01:01:59,070 --> 01:02:08,850
days in silence yeah sure for some

1149
01:02:06,659 --> 01:02:10,079
assurance for some strains okay Adam was

1150
01:02:08,849 --> 01:02:11,190
saying he had one that took a long time

1151
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:13,650
to switch into flour

1152
01:02:11,190 --> 01:02:16,019
it's just now getting to the point where

1153
01:02:13,650 --> 01:02:17,760
it's like visibly flower it probably it

1154
01:02:16,019 --> 01:02:20,849
probably switched last week or so

1155
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:22,260
officially you know but it is it's

1156
01:02:20,849 --> 01:02:25,199
definitely taken it might be a little

1157
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:26,730
bit longer but it the other two had

1158
01:02:25,199 --> 01:02:28,789
switched into flour three or four weeks

1159
01:02:26,730 --> 01:02:33,639
ago obviously and now have

1160
01:02:28,789 --> 01:02:37,039
these insights quarter-sized buds nice

1161
01:02:33,639 --> 01:02:38,599
there's a random question how long since

1162
01:02:37,039 --> 01:02:41,059
you're an outdoor girl I'm asking Jessie

1163
01:02:38,599 --> 01:02:42,679
he's an experienced I'm a city boy I

1164
01:02:41,059 --> 01:02:44,719
live indoors I grow indoors I don't

1165
01:02:42,679 --> 01:02:46,849
worry too much about the outside I don't

1166
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:48,289
know the answer I am a city boy yeah he

1167
01:02:46,849 --> 01:02:52,449
took me to the sticks and I'm [ __ ]

1168
01:02:48,289 --> 01:03:04,099
scared bro protect myself out there but

1169
01:02:52,449 --> 01:03:06,409
okay okay how long do we have

1170
01:03:04,099 --> 01:03:08,900
how many weeks or about when do you

1171
01:03:06,409 --> 01:03:13,219
expect frost one busy get too cold for

1172
01:03:08,900 --> 01:03:15,019
outdoor crop that's that's always good

1173
01:03:13,219 --> 01:03:17,089
question if I know the answer to that

1174
01:03:15,019 --> 01:03:19,300
you're not mother nature are you yeah

1175
01:03:17,090 --> 01:03:21,470
okay

1176
01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:25,370
sorry good would you agree that in

1177
01:03:21,469 --> 01:03:27,500

October 30th yeah you'll start to be

1183
01:03:35,300 --> 01:03:39,769
able to tell if you guys would snap so

1184
01:03:37,940 --> 01:03:41,300
I'm gonna grab a calendar right quick I

1185
01:03:39,769 --> 01:03:47,329
don't see how many weeks I'll just ask

1186
01:03:41,300 --> 01:03:51,140
Siri she'll tell me cv is great yeah how

1187
01:03:47,329 --> 01:03:54,559
many days until Halloween oh there we go

1188
01:03:51,139 --> 01:03:58,009
she'll tell me oh she failed series been

1189
01:03:54,559 --> 01:04:05,000
a not friendly chick today fire how many

1190
01:03:58,010 --> 01:04:06,620
days until Halloween she's looking 70

1191
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:08,449
days oh so most strains should be done

1192
01:04:06,619 --> 01:04:10,579
yeah even your stuff they just started

1193
01:04:08,449 --> 01:04:14,000
flowering should be done alright yeah

1194
01:04:10,579 --> 01:04:16,039
cool seventy days from so today is

1195
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:17,150
actually Thursday the show won't go up

1196
01:04:16,039 --> 01:04:19,789
until Monday morning so you're gonna

1197
01:04:17,150 --> 01:04:24,230
have closer to 65 but and you probably

1198
01:04:19,789 --> 01:04:25,759
won't listen till Wednesday so for nine

1199
01:04:24,230 --> 01:04:28,190
weeks you got about nine weeks to flower

1200
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:29,540
guys nine or ten weeks depending on

1201
01:04:28,190 --> 01:04:31,099
where you are if you're in California

1202
01:04:29,539 --> 01:04:32,539
you could get that [ __ ] out no problem

1203
01:04:31,099 --> 01:04:34,009
but if you're in Colorado you got about

1204
01:04:32,539 --> 01:04:36,139
nine weeks if you're higher up if you're

1205
01:04:34,010 --> 01:04:39,150
towards Denver you may want to cut that

1206
01:04:36,139 --> 01:04:41,980
little closer to Thanksgiving

1207
01:04:39,150 --> 01:04:44,860
people folks in California have been

1208
01:04:41,980 --> 01:04:46,480
flowering longer than us it seems like a

1209
01:04:44,860 --> 01:04:47,860
lot of them you know from the pictures

1210
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:50,500
I've seen they definitely went into

1211
01:04:47,860 --> 01:04:52,329
flower sooner I can imagine several

1212
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:54,219
things that why that would be but I

1213
01:04:52,329 --> 01:04:58,199
wonder what the actual reason is do you

1214
01:04:54,219 --> 01:04:58,199
think they've selected better strains

1215
01:05:01,619 --> 01:05:14,549
well to the coast maybe like just their

1216
01:05:11,530 --> 01:05:17,760
different region they're at a different

1217
01:05:14,550 --> 01:05:19,630
latitude and longitude in the Earth's

1218
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:22,090
north and south makes a huge difference

1219
01:05:19,630 --> 01:05:25,360
they get the Sun you know a slightly

1220
01:05:22,090 --> 01:05:26,680
different angle or so because if

1221
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:28,090
somebody understands why those plants in

1222
01:05:26,679 --> 01:05:29,769
Cali flowered sooner I think we just

1223
01:05:28,090 --> 01:05:31,600
nailed it but if you got that if you get

1224
01:05:29,769 --> 01:05:33,190
the science e reason tweet that to me

1225
01:05:31,599 --> 01:05:35,110
email it to me agriculture hotmail.com

1226
01:05:33,190 --> 01:05:36,450
had agriculture on Twitter let me know

1227
01:05:35,110 --> 01:05:39,670
we'd like to understand more of that

1228
01:05:36,449 --> 01:05:40,839
agriculture on Facebook we get it but we

1229
01:05:39,670 --> 01:05:42,420
want you to explain it because we're

1230
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:45,039
podcast host and stoners and

1231
01:05:42,420 --> 01:05:48,210
that's [ __ ] you can explain it but

1232
01:05:45,039 --> 01:05:50,349
we'd like to understand yeah yeah so

1233
01:05:48,210 --> 01:05:51,610
when he got here we took a bunch of dabs

1234
01:05:50,349 --> 01:05:54,579
of course and then we talked about we

1235
01:05:51,610 --> 01:05:55,840
wanted to do he talked about topdressing

1236
01:05:54,579 --> 01:05:57,250
a little bit do you want to talk about

1237
01:05:55,840 --> 01:06:00,940
the mulching and the topdressing

1238
01:05:57,250 --> 01:06:02,949
yeah for sure you know I think it's safe

1239
01:06:00,940 --> 01:06:05,349
to say to go ahead and switch over all

1240
01:06:02,949 --> 01:06:07,269
your top dressings and your teas and

1241
01:06:05,349 --> 01:06:12,089
stuff too you know throwing that that

1242
01:06:07,269 --> 01:06:16,750
hypee stuff hi PK you know pretty much

1243
01:06:12,090 --> 01:06:18,940
chill out on the nitrogen atoms got some

1244
01:06:16,750 --> 01:06:22,360
plants that are nitrogen deficient

1245
01:06:18,940 --> 01:06:25,480
visibly on the lower lower bottom lower

1246
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:27,130
third of the plant I told him to hit it

1247
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:32,369
real good with nitrogen one more time

1248
01:06:27,130 --> 01:06:32,369
real hard I was feeding you think okay

1249
01:06:33,780 --> 01:06:39,340
Jessie train a podcast will be a lot

1250
01:06:36,909 --> 01:06:41,019
more audible now I just noticed that

1251
01:06:39,340 --> 01:06:44,289
oh yeah look at that we can hear him

1252
01:06:41,019 --> 01:06:45,880
yeah sorry no worries bro wait I got a

1253
01:06:44,289 --> 01:06:47,710
compliment you're way more comfortable

1254
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:50,079
way more losing on the show now compared

1255
01:06:47,710 --> 01:06:53,230
to the first episode I think you want

1256
01:06:50,079 --> 01:06:55,210
number 8 or 6 there's number 8 and we're

1257
01:06:53,230 --> 01:07:01,150
at 26 now bro so you've been coming

1258
01:06:55,210 --> 01:07:04,570
quite a few times maybe you'd like a

1259
01:07:01,150 --> 01:07:06,840
little foliar feed of locally just to

1260
01:07:04,570 --> 01:07:10,539
that part of the planet a high nitrogen

1261
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:12,720
you know several different ways you

1262
01:07:10,539 --> 01:07:22,210
could do that option is basically to put

1263
01:07:12,719 --> 01:07:26,139
grow in a bottle and spray it anything

1264
01:07:22,210 --> 01:07:28,090
that's my problem is I'm a little under

1265
01:07:26,139 --> 01:07:29,559
feeding you know I'm saying yeah I mean

1266
01:07:28,090 --> 01:07:31,600
you gave me the chart and I've just been

1267
01:07:29,559 --> 01:07:33,369
basically going off of that besides all

1268
01:07:31,599 --> 01:07:35,469
the additives that I should have gotten

1269
01:07:33,369 --> 01:07:40,130
probably by now that I don't have yes I

1270
01:07:35,469 --> 01:07:42,480
told him to buy a couple of things you

1271
01:07:40,130 --> 01:07:44,769
[Music]

1272
01:07:42,480 --> 01:08:01,119
don't have a budget to allocate to

1273
01:07:44,769 --> 01:08:03,909
growing because when you harvest try to

1274
01:08:01,119 --> 01:08:05,949
either if you have a patient friend that

1275
01:08:03,909 --> 01:08:07,539
needs some medicine or I don't know the

1276
01:08:05,949 --> 01:08:08,769
[ __ ] straight way to do that but see

1277
01:08:07,539 --> 01:08:10,000
the money that you normally would have

1278
01:08:08,769 --> 01:08:11,829
gone to your caregiver or your

1279
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,849
dispensary save that money next year

1280
01:08:11,829 --> 01:08:15,190
because you're gonna have your own pot

1281
01:08:12,849 --> 01:08:17,140
if you're growing it and buy those

1282
01:08:15,190 --> 01:08:18,970
bottles that you could not get this year

1283
01:08:17,140 --> 01:08:20,410
absolutely make your shoots a little bit

1284
01:08:18,970 --> 01:08:22,449
better next year and then the next year

1285
01:08:20,409 --> 01:08:24,338
a little bit better than every then by

1286
01:08:22,449 --> 01:08:25,599
the time you're just an amateur girl you

1287
01:08:24,338 --> 01:08:27,250
don't need the [ __ ] rock star drum

1288
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:28,930
set yet yeah by the time you're a good

1289
01:08:27,250 --> 01:08:29,770
rock star you'll have a rock star setup

1290
01:08:28,930 --> 01:08:31,569
you'll know what you're doing it is

1291
01:08:29,770 --> 01:08:33,250
easier to learn I think these leg days I

1292
01:08:31,569 --> 01:08:34,690
became a good growler because I started

1293
01:08:33,250 --> 01:08:36,970
with struggle bud you know I started

1294
01:08:34,689 --> 01:08:38,889
with the shitty set on the socks and

1295
01:08:36,970 --> 01:08:40,088
then had to grow a whole crop through

1296
01:08:38,890 --> 01:08:41,859
that because you don't want to rebuild

1297
01:08:40,088 --> 01:08:43,359
your room in the middle of a grow and

1298
01:08:41,859 --> 01:08:45,319
then bother the next upgrade and then

1299
01:08:43,359 --> 01:08:47,270
realize they had a room

1300
01:08:45,319 --> 01:08:49,969
I've always had like a small box was

1301
01:08:47,270 --> 01:08:51,290
playing and then now it's outdoors so

1302
01:08:49,969 --> 01:08:52,730
you were never in a state where you

1303
01:08:51,289 --> 01:08:54,649
could just go to the grow shop and be

1304
01:08:52,729 --> 01:08:57,379
like I need this yeah we could walk in

1305
01:08:54,649 --> 01:08:59,479
it almost feels like we're cheating it's

1306
01:08:57,380 --> 01:09:02,118
almost too easy too is bleeding at this

1307
01:08:59,479 --> 01:09:03,789
point it's almost too easy let's go back

1308
01:09:02,118 --> 01:09:06,979
to top dressing with mulch you should be

1309
01:09:03,789 --> 01:09:08,868
with your full bloom feed like he was

1310
01:09:06,979 --> 01:09:10,578
saying pull back on the nitrogen

1311
01:09:08,868 --> 01:09:13,639
get your phosphorous and potassium and

1312
01:09:10,578 --> 01:09:16,039
they're heavily for sure um so you're

1313
01:09:13,639 --> 01:09:17,659
mulching your uh explain that to the

1314
01:09:16,039 --> 01:09:19,009
guys that like [ __ ] I'll tell you I'm

1315
01:09:17,658 --> 01:09:20,960
[ __ ] on mulching I know how to mulch

1316
01:09:19,009 --> 01:09:23,238
my yard of my trees outside what are we

1317
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:27,198
using for mulch for our weed plants I've

1318
01:09:23,238 --> 01:09:31,149
been using a fresh green matter most of

1319
01:09:27,198 --> 01:09:33,638
us from the plant itself the leaves and

1320
01:09:31,149 --> 01:09:37,158
weed seed things I've been pulling up

1321
01:09:33,639 --> 01:09:40,190
and then also I've been well I've been

1322
01:09:37,158 --> 01:09:43,818
mixing that with straw that's been

1323
01:09:40,189 --> 01:09:46,939
composted and I'm you know I'm building

1324
01:09:43,819 --> 01:09:50,630
a mulch mound around the plants that's

1325
01:09:46,939 --> 01:09:55,368
probably eight ten inches tall and the

1326
01:09:50,630 --> 01:09:57,199
circumference of the ya-ya

1327
01:09:55,368 --> 01:10:00,380
picture Ninkasi can is kind of what I

1328
01:09:57,198 --> 01:10:03,618
see I mean it's up it's a frickin mound

1329
01:10:00,380 --> 01:10:06,349
man okay yeah no it's pretty you know

1330
01:10:03,618 --> 01:10:08,539
maybe closer like 10 or 12 inches in the

1331
01:10:06,349 --> 01:10:12,409
center then we're coming out probably

1332
01:10:08,539 --> 01:10:15,649
I'm feeding circumference but when I've

1333
01:10:12,408 --> 01:10:19,328
removed part of the to apply top

1334
01:10:15,649 --> 01:10:22,009
dressing the root growth that I've seen

1335
01:10:19,328 --> 01:10:25,698
it's just phenomenal

1336
01:10:22,010 --> 01:10:28,190
this soil just looks better it looks

1337
01:10:25,698 --> 01:10:30,098
happier it's not as tight as it normally

1338
01:10:28,189 --> 01:10:33,469
gets when it's getting sun-baked

1339
01:10:30,099 --> 01:10:35,029
and you know I've always top dirt

1340
01:10:33,469 --> 01:10:37,698
mulched a little bit but never to this

1341
01:10:35,029 --> 01:10:39,649
extent and I've just so we'd nature

1342
01:10:37,698 --> 01:10:41,779
wouldn't leaves fall off of a plant to

1343
01:10:39,649 --> 01:10:43,488
kind of decompose for one of the plants

1344
01:10:41,779 --> 01:10:44,569
growing and provide that nutrient for

1345
01:10:43,488 --> 01:10:47,000
next year so that makes a lot of great

1346
01:10:44,569 --> 01:10:50,029
sense here's my question do you ever

1347
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:53,948
worry about heat with that no I know I

1348
01:10:50,029 --> 01:10:53,948
mean I did initially because

1349
01:10:54,319 --> 01:11:01,309
yeah but that's why I've always kind of

1350
01:10:58,279 --> 01:11:05,719
steered away from it but doing the big

1351
01:11:01,310 --> 01:11:07,670
mound with you know it's just this work

1352
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:09,680
great you know it'll be dry on top but

1353
01:11:07,670 --> 01:11:12,289
has it worked out into it look there's

1354
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:14,869
somebody to keep the heat off my soil

1355
01:11:12,289 --> 01:11:17,630
because my soil is just baked and my

1356
01:11:14,869 --> 01:11:19,159
sand yeah because somebody was like put

1357
01:11:17,630 --> 01:11:28,010
a layer sand on there and I went out

1358
01:11:19,159 --> 01:11:29,930
there and my plans for like dirt bugs

1359
01:11:28,010 --> 01:11:35,390
with sand if you do it use a really tiny

1360
01:11:29,930 --> 01:11:40,310
tiny layer reapply it every single time

1361
01:11:35,390 --> 01:11:41,690
after you water we've kind of worked

1362
01:11:40,310 --> 01:11:43,760
over to one of the things that we wrote

1363
01:11:41,689 --> 01:11:45,859
down to talk about watering good outdoor

1364
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:48,590
growing it's been at ninety something

1365

01:12:32,630 --> 01:12:37,250
top three different times by the end of

1382
01:12:35,449 --> 01:12:38,059
the day they are dry and I can pick them

1383
01:12:37,250 --> 01:12:44,029

1395
01:13:14,260 --> 01:13:18,820
weeds out of my yard they were tall and

1396
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:20,260
atrocious can I just throw them in a

1397
01:13:18,819 --> 01:13:21,939
bucket and start molding them I'm

1398
01:13:20,260 --> 01:13:25,000
worried about bugs you know I'm saying I

1399
01:13:21,939 --> 01:13:26,919
mean that the plant matter I can

1400
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:30,189
definitely work with you know like I'd

1401
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:31,750
be a little nervous about that okay so

1402
01:13:30,189 --> 01:13:37,179
don't just grab any weeds and start

1403
01:13:31,750 --> 01:13:38,859
mulching it yeah yeah you know select

1404
01:13:37,180 --> 01:13:41,770
about my my tweezer actually Morning

1405
01:13:38,859 --> 01:13:43,929
Glory seeds nice and if anyone knows

1406
01:13:41,770 --> 01:13:47,700
anything about Morning Glory yeah highly

1407
01:13:43,930 --> 01:13:50,680
highly invasive so it's he easy to find

1408
01:13:47,699 --> 01:13:52,569
so how much water sorry how big are your

1409
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:53,710
plants outdoors can I even ask today I

1410
01:13:52,569 --> 01:13:53,979
can avoid questions you don't want to

1411
01:13:53,710 --> 01:13:58,289
answer

1412
01:13:53,979 --> 01:14:01,659
we're doing like a six to eight foot

1413
01:13:58,289 --> 01:14:13,269
each one's probably minimum of four foot

1414
01:14:01,659 --> 01:14:20,739
in circumference pictures the stalks are

1415
01:14:13,270 --> 01:14:23,440
as big as my forearm rubs how much how

1416
01:14:20,739 --> 01:14:25,599
much water does a plant that size take

1417
01:14:23,439 --> 01:14:26,379
every day seven and a half to ten

1418
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:29,260
gallons a day

1419
01:14:26,380 --> 01:14:38,079
Wow times however many plants he's got

1420
01:14:29,260 --> 01:14:40,150
we won't even go there so d4 nated rural

1421
01:14:38,079 --> 01:14:41,260
area because there's not enough water to

1422
01:14:40,149 --> 01:14:42,639
do that if you're just coming out of

1423
01:14:41,260 --> 01:14:44,650
your well sometimes you don't want to

1424
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:54,250
drain the well I'm gonna have water for

1425
01:14:44,649 --> 01:14:57,309
your life federal government regulates

1426
01:14:54,250 --> 01:14:58,960
most well so yeah they're real

1427
01:14:57,310 --> 01:15:01,300
understanding of pot grows as they

1428
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:05,560
understand it so they're real inviting

1429
01:15:01,300 --> 01:15:07,029
for that sort of thing alright so we've

1430
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:08,710
covered a lot about water halt man there

1431
01:15:07,029 --> 01:15:10,300
was a hum and I just found it there's a

1432
01:15:08,710 --> 01:15:12,390
squeal in my headphones I hope it only

1433
01:15:10,300 --> 01:15:14,670
happened in my ears but

1434
01:15:12,390 --> 01:15:17,520
I was my headphone could have been my

1435
01:15:14,670 --> 01:15:19,319
head so yeah that's something we talked

1436
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:21,090
about a few episodes ago the federal

1437
01:15:19,319 --> 01:15:23,369
government is banning [ __ ] water use

1438
01:15:21,090 --> 01:15:24,960
for dispensaries and grows which if they

1439
01:15:23,369 --> 01:15:26,760
catch if a federal agent

1440
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:28,079
federal agent if somebody for like the

1441
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:29,659
Department of Water Works or somebody

1442
01:15:28,079 --> 01:15:31,949
something that works in a federal agency

1443
01:15:29,659 --> 01:15:34,289
discovers water in their municipality

1444
01:15:31,949 --> 01:15:36,029
being used for a cannabis grow they're

1445
01:15:34,289 --> 01:15:37,109
supposed to report the cannabis girl in

1446
01:15:36,029 --> 01:15:39,779
the water that's something we talked

1447
01:15:37,109 --> 01:15:42,750
about a few episodes ago whack [ __ ] be

1448
01:15:39,779 --> 01:15:46,319
careful you guys be super careful try to

1449
01:15:42,750 --> 01:15:48,300
be super discreet alright we talked a

1450
01:15:46,319 --> 01:15:50,340
little bit about worms you were saying

1451
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:52,650
that the worms were crawling up into

1452
01:15:50,340 --> 01:15:55,350
your mulch yeah that's crazy

1453
01:15:52,649 --> 01:15:57,089
that means happy mulch yeah the worms

1454
01:15:55,350 --> 01:15:57,800
get up there they're probably eating

1455
01:15:57,090 --> 01:16:00,390
those leaves

1456
01:15:57,800 --> 01:16:03,060
they're probably secreting their enzymes

1457
01:16:00,390 --> 01:16:05,520
all over those leaves those leaves are

1458
01:16:03,060 --> 01:16:07,920
breaking down and becoming nutrients

1459
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:09,660
that are more bioavailable to the plants

1460
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:13,159
so that's a win-win situation for

1461
01:16:09,659 --> 01:16:29,639
everybody yeah do you guys hear that no

1462
01:16:13,159 --> 01:16:33,059
my headphones or something yeah it's

1463
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:34,500
this hero4 from livewire solutions I've

1464
01:16:33,060 --> 01:16:42,960
talked about it on the show before [ __ ]

1465
01:16:34,500 --> 01:16:55,350
this thing got me is it completely cool

1466
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:56,550
things works I will not say the name of

1467
01:16:55,350 --> 01:16:57,480
the company one more time it's alive

1468
01:16:56,550 --> 01:16:59,850
we're solutions

1469
01:16:57,479 --> 01:17:02,069
hero4 for channel stereo headphone

1470
01:16:59,850 --> 01:17:05,100
amplifier don't buy that thing

1471
01:17:02,069 --> 01:17:06,149
that's my anti sponsor right there how

1472
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:08,520
you guys keep saying won't you buy

1473
01:17:06,149 --> 01:17:09,960
something better well I bought this one

1474
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:12,180
and it keeps breaking so I go to Guitar

1475
01:17:09,960 --> 01:17:13,439
Center and I say this thing broke again

1476
01:17:12,180 --> 01:17:16,380
and they just give me another one of the

1477
01:17:13,439 --> 01:17:18,419
same thing so it just cost me a trip to

1478
01:17:16,380 --> 01:17:19,380
Guitar Center every few weeks which you

1479
01:17:18,420 --> 01:17:20,909
know they're cool over there and I

1480
01:17:19,380 --> 01:17:23,520
always find new toys so what the hell

1481
01:17:20,909 --> 01:17:24,630
let's do it hopefully their company goes

1482
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:27,179
out of business thing

1483
01:17:24,630 --> 01:17:29,699
upgrade there you go if I recall now

1484
01:17:27,179 --> 01:17:32,310
you're thinking some store credit on an

1485
01:17:29,698 --> 01:17:33,779
upgrade or something yeah that's just

1486
01:17:32,310 --> 01:17:36,239
random talk guys I hope you enjoy

1487
01:17:33,779 --> 01:17:37,500
hearing us talk about messages that are

1488
01:17:36,238 --> 01:17:39,059
like just hang out and talk we love

1489
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:43,948
hearing you talk so that was some of

1490
01:17:39,060 --> 01:17:46,050
that but that's right

1491
01:17:43,948 --> 01:17:47,819
so worms yeah worms are awesome put

1492
01:17:46,050 --> 01:17:52,500
worms by the roots of your plants all

1493
01:17:47,819 --> 01:17:56,219
the time if you find a warm don't bury

1494
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:57,929
it that it's not how that works okay let

1495
01:17:56,219 --> 01:17:59,969
me explain that and not still in our

1496
01:17:57,929 --> 01:18:02,880
talk it if you find a worm I mean you

1497
01:17:59,969 --> 01:18:06,380
want to put it into your plant don't

1498
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:10,590
bury it gently put him on the surface

1499
01:18:06,380 --> 01:18:12,060
him working his way down or its way in

1500
01:18:10,590 --> 01:18:14,400
there so I'm sure yours are in the

1501
01:18:12,060 --> 01:18:15,780
ground so finding worms and your plants

1502
01:18:14,399 --> 01:18:17,670
are one thing but should I go out and

1503
01:18:15,779 --> 01:18:20,189
get some worms would that be beneficial

1504
01:18:17,670 --> 01:18:22,800
at the beginning of us you know when I

1505
01:18:20,189 --> 01:18:25,019
first put the plants out there I don't

1506
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:27,179
think it would hurt

1507
01:18:25,020 --> 01:18:32,909
that's your feeding bottled nutrients

1508
01:18:27,179 --> 01:18:36,480
there's a lot of I've never Tinley had

1509
01:18:32,908 --> 01:18:40,379
worms in indoor plants before but never

1510
01:18:36,479 --> 01:18:47,519
purposely so pop mushrooms in your soil

1511
01:18:40,380 --> 01:18:50,369
on accident those changes yeah I got

1512
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:51,960
some crazy coke grow Kashi compost going

1513
01:18:50,369 --> 01:18:54,988

1514
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:57,389

off and don't eat I mean that little

1535
01:19:42,719 --> 01:19:45,059
motor the stem comes out or the little

1536
01:19:44,130 --> 01:19:47,219
tip that's funky

1537
01:19:45,059 --> 01:19:48,719
for sure bananas have a peel my avocado

1538
01:19:47,219 --> 01:19:50,429
I need a ton of avocados they all have a

1539
01:19:48,719 --> 01:19:53,460
peel they always have some shitty brown

1540
01:19:50,429 --> 01:19:55,770
spot in them no throw that damn trash in

1541
01:19:53,460 --> 01:19:58,980
the compost pile all of that no just try

1542
01:19:55,770 --> 01:20:02,849
the girl cause she just what I've been

1543
01:19:58,979 --> 01:20:05,189
doing is just a bucket I've got one

1544
01:20:02,849 --> 01:20:08,279
right now it's just all veggie scraps

1545
01:20:05,189 --> 01:20:10,288
which would be all greens I've got

1546
01:20:08,279 --> 01:20:13,158
another one I'm doing started a little

1547
01:20:10,288 --> 01:20:20,488
earlier it's half carbon half grains

1548
01:20:13,158 --> 01:20:24,439
explain the carbon to the retards greens

1549
01:20:20,488 --> 01:20:28,158
are living things carbon would be like

1550
01:20:24,439 --> 01:20:32,460
peat moss I've I suppose would be carbon

1551
01:20:28,158 --> 01:20:34,259
coconut or cocoa shell tried up sticks

1552
01:20:32,460 --> 01:20:38,929
try to believe that shells

1553
01:20:34,260 --> 01:20:41,130
that's eggshells but you have to have a

1554
01:20:38,929 --> 01:20:43,679
50/50 mixture well you don't have to

1555
01:20:41,130 --> 01:20:45,389
have but two guys ideal yeah I'm not to

1556

01:20:45,389 --> 01:20:51,150
all right so I just took that 1/3 cup

1558
01:20:48,538 --> 01:20:54,599
1/3 of a cup of cocoa she makes that

1559
01:20:51,149 --> 01:20:57,118
[ __ ] in there threw it away six days

1560
01:20:54,599 --> 01:21:06,059

1561
01:20:57,118 --> 01:21:08,308

I totally will tweet jessee's and I've

1565
01:21:15,109 --> 01:21:19,859
lots of different styles of composting

1566
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:21,840
before and this is hands down the

1567
01:21:19,859 --> 01:21:23,519
easiest yeah that sounds right up my

1568
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:24,900
alley I'm super stoked because they'll

1569
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:27,320
be able have fresh compost all through

1570
01:21:24,899 --> 01:21:30,839

1571
01:21:27,319 --> 01:21:33,630

nice kind of what I was reading from

1576
01:21:39,809 --> 01:21:44,760
this guy yeah I'm gonna sift it out but

1577
01:21:42,270 --> 01:21:46,170
if it needs to be a which is like a 1/4

1578
01:21:44,760 --> 01:21:48,420
inch screen

1579
01:21:46,170 --> 01:21:51,060
you just take it all dump it on there

1580
01:21:48,420 --> 01:21:53,460
sift it through it'll catch anything

1581
01:21:51,060 --> 01:21:55,500
that's not composted yet and then

1582
01:21:53,460 --> 01:21:57,710
everything that comes through is BAM was

1583
01:21:55,500 --> 01:22:00,750

01:22:35,130 --> 01:22:38,100
waste to it bananas have a peel like I

01:22:36,719 --> 01:22:39,899
was saying everything comes off the vine

1598
01:22:38,100 --> 01:22:43,340
at some point and where usually where it

1599
01:22:39,899 --> 01:22:43,339
comes off the vine we as American

1600
01:22:43,609 --> 01:22:48,479
[Music]

1601
01:22:45,738 --> 01:22:50,399
experiment with some you know scraps

1602
01:22:48,479 --> 01:22:54,029
from different grows and stuff like that

1603
01:22:50,399 --> 01:22:56,670
yeah clean leaves clean leaves old stems

1604
01:22:54,029 --> 01:22:57,210
could be my my fiber part carbon part

1605
01:22:56,670 --> 01:22:59,369
for sure

1606
01:22:57,210 --> 01:23:00,899
awesome that's a great idea man you guys

1607
01:22:59,369 --> 01:23:03,300
just learned something with me I'm glad

1608
01:23:00,899 --> 01:23:08,729
we could all learn that your fan leaves

1609
01:23:03,300 --> 01:23:10,170
to buy a juicer I also have another way

1610
01:23:08,729 --> 01:23:12,019
of composting this is actually the

1611
01:23:10,170 --> 01:23:22,109
easiest way composting I've ever

1612
01:23:12,020 --> 01:23:26,280
discovered I feed it to my chickens all

1613
01:23:22,109 --> 01:23:27,448
right what was about to say oh I don't

1614
01:23:26,279 --> 01:23:28,829
even remember there were so many things

1615
01:23:27,448 --> 01:23:30,359
happening to my brain just now that's a

1616
01:23:28,829 --> 01:23:32,869
lot let's get back on topic here it's

1617
01:23:30,359 --> 01:23:32,869
not serious

1618
01:23:36,319 --> 01:23:41,488
yeah all the stuff we're eating we

1619
01:23:40,500 --> 01:23:43,319
should think about what we put into

1620
01:23:41,488 --> 01:23:44,729
ourselves cuz that's what we should be

1621
01:23:43,319 --> 01:23:45,420
feeding our plants kind of the same way

1622
01:23:44,729 --> 01:23:47,069
you don't want to feed your plants

1623
01:23:45,420 --> 01:23:49,920
watermelons but like think about what's

1624
01:23:47,069 --> 01:23:50,939
in what yeah think about your health

1625
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:52,260
think about your pie health it's all the

1626
01:23:50,939 --> 01:23:53,759
same [ __ ] once you start paying

1627
01:23:52,260 --> 01:23:55,530
attention you'll match up you'll start

1628
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:57,210
feeling better you'll definitely pay

1629
01:23:55,529 --> 01:23:58,948
attention I notice that from the last

1630
01:23:57,210 --> 01:23:59,179
show that you were here and you said you

1631
01:23:58,948 --> 01:24:02,539
know

1632
01:23:59,179 --> 01:24:05,359
we we go out and we spend the money on

1633
01:24:02,539 --> 01:24:07,939
expensive bud and expensive water and

1634
01:24:05,359 --> 01:24:12,408
then we just put 99 I'm the worst at

1635
01:24:07,939 --> 01:24:15,589
that dude I've been I told her straight

1636
01:24:12,408 --> 01:24:20,869
up after that I go get meals go make

1637
01:24:15,590 --> 01:24:24,579
food for sure it's fun I mean me and my

1638
01:24:20,869 --> 01:24:28,140
wife cooked together so I didn't do that

1639
01:24:24,579 --> 01:24:28,140
[Music]

1640
01:24:29,350 --> 01:24:33,230
fun

1641
01:24:31,219 --> 01:24:35,329
I cooked lunch with a little lady today

1642
01:24:33,229 --> 01:24:37,639
and it was a great time I cook for her

1643
01:24:35,329 --> 01:24:39,408
sometimes usually she can't make bacon

1644
01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:41,539
the best but I'm saying see well that's

1645
01:24:39,408 --> 01:24:43,429
your job and you make the bacon that's

1646
01:24:41,539 --> 01:24:46,399
why they said making bacon bacon the

1647
01:24:43,429 --> 01:24:53,960
bacon yep yep all right let's get back

1648
01:24:46,399 --> 01:25:10,729
on track maybe a little bit I agree with

1649
01:24:53,960 --> 01:25:12,529
you but I mean if you want to say try to

1650
01:25:10,729 --> 01:25:19,488
get drinking and driving as cool off to

1651
01:25:12,529 --> 01:25:21,529
children let's you know let's clarify

1652
01:25:19,488 --> 01:25:25,219
that and it's like okay you know but

1653
01:25:21,529 --> 01:25:27,759
he's slammed by the end of every show

1654
01:25:25,220 --> 01:25:29,179
[Music]

1655
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:31,880
all right

1656
01:25:29,179 --> 01:25:33,380
we're hitting flour hard our plants are

1657
01:25:31,880 --> 01:25:34,880
in flour were shown the fuzzies we

1658
01:25:33,380 --> 01:25:37,730
pulled our mails we've topped dressed

1659
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:39,760
our worms are happy we've switched to

1660
01:25:37,729 --> 01:25:42,769
full bloom nutrients they're feeding

1661
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:45,380
your feet even bottled nutrients go

1662
01:25:42,770 --> 01:25:47,719
lightly on the nitrogen there the grow

1663
01:25:45,380 --> 01:25:50,989
or the bloom stuff now if you're feeding

1664
01:25:47,719 --> 01:25:55,989
teas and stuff what should we be mixing

1665
01:25:50,988 --> 01:25:58,039
into our teas at this time seabird guano

1666
01:25:55,988 --> 01:26:01,149
that's pretty much where I get all my

1667
01:25:58,039 --> 01:26:04,729
nitrogen for the bloom faced from okay

1668
01:26:01,149 --> 01:26:08,319
and then also most sea bird guano's

1669
01:26:04,729 --> 01:26:12,039
typically you know kind of high in pee

1670
01:26:08,319 --> 01:26:12,039
least a little bit yeah

1671
01:26:25,170 --> 01:26:31,460
[Music]

out with us the next time he was away

1684
01:27:16,619 --> 01:27:41,789
from my pocket but just because I feel

1685
01:27:39,689 --> 01:27:42,839
like I'm not the wrong guy we're gonna

1686
01:27:41,789 --> 01:27:49,019
go look right now we're going to

1687
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:54,420
Facebook get this out before it yeah the

1688

high P bat guano's if you got him you

1689
01:27:54,420 --> 01:27:58,109
know that's they're good they're not

1690
01:27:56,310 --> 01:28:01,710
very sustainable any of those bat

1691
01:27:58,109 --> 01:28:05,729
guano's really really suck but it is

1692
01:28:01,710 --> 01:28:07,529
what it is so don't you know not

1693
01:28:05,729 --> 01:28:09,359
everyone's just conflicted as I am I

1694
01:28:07,529 --> 01:28:13,559
suppose but I'm sure I got the right guy

1695
01:28:09,359 --> 01:28:18,809
yeah nice I'm happy now sweet but uh

1696
01:28:13,560 --> 01:28:22,989
yeah switch to the high P and rock it

1697
01:28:18,810 --> 01:28:25,119
out any molasses yeah I always do

1698
01:28:22,988 --> 01:28:27,998
I always do molasses almost every feat

1699
01:28:25,118 --> 01:28:31,058
in flower after a 21 passes or something

1700
01:28:27,998 --> 01:28:32,828
similar humble honey the Mendocino honey

1701
01:28:31,059 --> 01:28:36,090
those are I like the humble because it's

1702
01:28:32,828 --> 01:28:36,090
got the yucca extract in there

1703
01:28:36,670 --> 01:28:40,559
it's dirty cheap there might be yucca

1704
01:28:38,439 --> 01:28:43,498
extract in that one but not as much oh

1705
01:28:40,559 --> 01:28:47,519
he's taking a pretty big dad right now

1706
01:28:43,498 --> 01:28:47,519
carb cap if you want it there you go

1707
01:28:50,609 --> 01:28:54,368
it was just hard to pull it up with that

1708
01:28:53,019 --> 01:29:11,099
other dad or how it needed the cutting

1709
01:28:54,368 --> 01:29:13,719
edge on that one brother fishbone mill

1710
01:29:11,099 --> 01:29:18,699
that's always high in P that's some good

1711
01:29:13,719 --> 01:29:21,460
stuff too and I always go with the kelp

1712
01:29:18,698 --> 01:29:23,948
so and I've noticed something

1713
01:29:21,460 --> 01:29:27,010
I wonder what's up with this I've had

1714
01:29:23,948 --> 01:29:29,439
some kelp that is one zero one and then

1715
01:29:27,010 --> 01:29:30,550
I just recently bought some kelp that is

1716
01:29:29,439 --> 01:29:33,698
zero zero one

1717
01:29:30,550 --> 01:29:35,230
it's the exact same strained or you know

1718
01:29:33,698 --> 01:29:38,018
if that's to the assister right from and

1719
01:29:35,229 --> 01:29:41,888
it's that whatever strain that you

1720
01:29:38,019 --> 01:29:44,469
always see but yeah I wonder what's up

1721
01:29:41,889 --> 01:29:45,760
with that you know I don't pay enough

1722
01:29:44,469 --> 01:29:48,550
attention to the packaging I should

1723
01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:50,199
start looking at that there are certain

1724
01:29:48,550 --> 01:29:52,150
things I never pay attention to because

1725
01:29:50,198 --> 01:29:54,129
you know the look on my face doesn't

1726
01:29:52,149 --> 01:29:56,558
convey a podcast but I have got a very

1727
01:29:54,130 --> 01:29:58,929
curious look now like huh do they make

1728
01:29:56,559 --> 01:30:01,360
different packaging for different runs

1729
01:29:58,929 --> 01:30:04,510
or because you know different companies

1730
01:30:01,359 --> 01:30:06,038
- okay it's - I mean where did the

1731
01:30:04,510 --> 01:30:09,460
nitrogen come from all the sudden you

1732
01:30:06,038 --> 01:30:11,979
know yeah this be the same product yeah

1733
01:30:09,460 --> 01:30:14,019
just different testing calibrations for

1734
01:30:11,979 --> 01:30:18,788
sure yeah well they supposed to be

1735
01:30:14,019 --> 01:30:21,730
standardized though supposed to be

1736
01:30:18,788 --> 01:30:23,590
supposed to be supposed to alright it's

1737
01:30:21,729 --> 01:30:24,788
my turn I'm gonna take this bag big

1738
01:30:23,590 --> 01:30:25,779
dabbas gonna give it to Adam but I

1739
01:30:24,788 --> 01:30:27,229
realize how big it is and he doesn't

1740
01:30:25,779 --> 01:30:28,519
want to do this

1741
01:30:27,229 --> 01:30:30,439
it doesn't do that sort of thing

1742
01:30:28,520 --> 01:30:32,270
lightweight homeo I should ask a

1743
01:30:30,439 --> 01:30:36,099
question before I take a DAB

1744
01:30:32,270 --> 01:30:38,600
I asked about T's asked about feeding uh

1745
01:30:36,100 --> 01:30:40,340
it's time to finally train those things

1746
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:41,750
right now if we want to do any LST

1747
01:30:40,340 --> 01:30:43,310
training or anything like that we better

1748
01:30:41,750 --> 01:30:43,850
do it before they start butting out like

1749
01:30:43,310 --> 01:30:45,440
crazy

1750
01:30:43,850 --> 01:30:47,450
give them some sticks to support

1751
01:30:45,439 --> 01:30:51,019
themselves I said support themselves

1752
01:30:47,449 --> 01:30:53,300
support I guess I'm excited about this

1753
01:30:51,020 --> 01:30:55,310
tab so tell us about what we need to do

1754
01:30:53,300 --> 01:30:58,279
and then we will talk about after that

1755
01:30:55,310 --> 01:31:01,430
we'll talk about problems to look for

1756
01:30:58,279 --> 01:31:03,319
and the biggest fear of all gardeners

1757
01:31:01,430 --> 01:31:05,820
we'll talk about those two things so I'm

1758
01:31:03,319 --> 01:31:09,989
gonna take your data Jesse will talk

1759
01:31:05,819 --> 01:31:09,989
[Music]

1760
01:31:15,699 --> 01:31:24,789
let's see so word [ __ ] I'm stoned we're

1761
01:31:20,710 --> 01:31:27,829
training so if you got the bamboos I

1762
01:31:24,789 --> 01:31:33,590
kind of like to stick them in the ground

1763
01:31:27,829 --> 01:31:35,569
as an angle attach the plant at a at a

1764
01:31:33,590 --> 01:31:38,360
lower angle on the bamboo so that it's

1765
01:31:35,569 --> 01:31:40,399
still going past it are you angling in

1766
01:31:38,359 --> 01:31:45,229
toward the pot or out from the center of

1767
01:31:40,399 --> 01:31:48,229
the yeah

1768
01:31:45,229 --> 01:31:51,289
so you actually went to the bud dangling

1769
01:31:48,229 --> 01:31:55,069
above the bamboo and that kind of gives

1770
01:31:51,289 --> 01:31:56,899
it a chance to develop its its girth and

1771
01:31:55,069 --> 01:32:00,259
then just gonna kind of fall towards the

1772
01:31:56,899 --> 01:32:04,429
bamboo and and you wrap it up kind of

1773
01:32:00,260 --> 01:32:07,130
predict where it's gonna fall yeah also

1774
01:32:04,430 --> 01:32:08,989
I mean just straight up bamboos without

1775
01:32:07,130 --> 01:32:12,529
doors make sure you tell your plants in

1776
01:32:08,988 --> 01:32:16,129
at least two places the wind once you

1777
01:32:12,529 --> 01:32:18,099
start pinning plants with bamboos and

1778
01:32:16,130 --> 01:32:20,090
steaks and stuff like that

1779
01:32:18,100 --> 01:32:23,180
[Music]

1780
01:32:20,090 --> 01:32:25,430
he knows this you put them be you know

1781
01:32:23,180 --> 01:32:27,829
the supplies in dorks to but make sure

1782
01:32:25,430 --> 01:32:31,010
you get him tied up and good in two

1783
01:32:27,829 --> 01:32:33,619
places real good so that anything

1784
01:32:31,010 --> 01:32:35,900
doesn't break over there was such a

1785
01:32:33,619 --> 01:32:37,369
stone bramble that was perfect you said

1786
01:32:35,899 --> 01:32:39,199
exactly what needed to be said while

1787
01:32:37,369 --> 01:32:40,618
Adam and I both got to take a DAB and

1788
01:32:39,199 --> 01:32:43,260
kind of get our [ __ ] back to

1789
01:32:40,618 --> 01:32:44,729
I gave us big dads um see now I'm kind

1790
01:32:43,260 --> 01:32:46,619
of new to the bamboo sneaking just

1791
01:32:44,729 --> 01:32:49,259
because I never had plants big enough to

1792
01:32:46,618 --> 01:32:50,819
even need stuff like that

1793
01:32:49,260 --> 01:32:52,679
I can asked him he told me the same

1794
01:32:50,819 --> 01:32:54,630
thing the other day and I asked him you

1795
01:32:52,679 --> 01:32:56,279
know what's really the purpose of it and

1796
01:32:54,630 --> 01:32:57,989
he's like you know just to hold it there

1797
01:32:56,279 --> 01:32:59,609
now I have a tomato cage and I went out

1798
01:32:57,988 --> 01:33:02,118
I purchased the only sticks that were

1799
01:32:59,609 --> 01:33:05,670
because you know living here in Colorado

1800
01:33:02,118 --> 01:33:12,509
things are not quite as available as you

1801
01:33:05,670 --> 01:33:14,039
think they would I had to you know I got

1802
01:33:12,510 --> 01:33:15,780
little ones with the little rings in

1803
01:33:14,039 --> 01:33:17,939
them the I can just hold up my side

1804
01:33:15,779 --> 01:33:19,679
because those ones right now I figure I

1805
01:33:17,939 --> 01:33:22,079
can just tie it with a loose string I

1806
01:33:19,679 --> 01:33:25,050
got some branches coming in you know

1807
01:33:22,079 --> 01:33:30,149
just holding it up against the the the

1808
01:33:25,050 --> 01:33:32,880
tomato cage so yeah I mean if nothing

1809
01:33:30,149 --> 01:33:34,500
else you could you know that may be an

1810
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:38,069
earlier stage running through the tomato

1811
01:33:34,500 --> 01:33:40,020
cage or yeah yeah the way you did it is

1812
01:33:38,069 --> 01:33:41,698
perfect though the only thing that Adam

1813
01:33:40,020 --> 01:33:43,050
did wrong is he tried to put the tomato

1814
01:33:41,698 --> 01:33:44,638
cages on a little late so he had to

1815
01:33:43,050 --> 01:33:47,039
struggle with that next time I'll show

1816
01:33:44,639 --> 01:33:49,230
you a really smooth trick it takes like

1817
01:33:47,039 --> 01:33:51,779
a I use a twisty tie or a [ __ ] like a

1818
01:33:49,229 --> 01:33:53,129
pipe cleaner than home fuzzy sticks just

1819
01:33:51,779 --> 01:33:54,750
grab the plant from the bottom and go up

1820
01:33:53,130 --> 01:33:56,279
and then just tie that [ __ ] in a couple

1821
01:33:54,750 --> 01:33:59,039
of spots then you get a slide the cage

1822
01:33:56,279 --> 01:34:01,079
on for the size cages I got I think it

1823
01:33:59,039 --> 01:34:02,670
was still a little too late for that cuz

1824
01:34:01,079 --> 01:34:04,170
I tried that trick when I went out and

1825
01:34:02,670 --> 01:34:06,899
bought the last one and it was just like

1826
01:34:04,170 --> 01:34:08,310
no no no I just stuck it down in the

1827
01:34:06,899 --> 01:34:10,679
middle and it kind of branched it all

1828
01:34:08,310 --> 01:34:12,750
out yeah there you go you can also cut

1829
01:34:10,679 --> 01:34:20,819
them open and then just wire them back

1830
01:34:12,750 --> 01:34:27,439
together but next year I plan to to have

1831
01:34:20,819 --> 01:34:27,439
the small square fence lines around

1832
01:34:27,649 --> 01:34:35,339
that's something that I've been seeing a

1833
01:34:30,060 --> 01:34:39,980
lot lately on you know so I actually

1834
01:34:35,340 --> 01:34:43,110
tomorrow have to try to put one on

1835
01:34:39,979 --> 01:34:43,888
actually sell a 16-inch tomato cage that

1836
01:34:43,109 --> 01:34:45,630
comes apart

1837
01:34:43,889 --> 01:34:47,609
the sticks are three different pieces

1838
01:34:45,630 --> 01:34:49,050
and the cage is two different loops that

1839
01:34:47,609 --> 01:34:52,529
come apart so you can put that on after

1840
01:34:49,050 --> 01:34:53,970
I really endorse those tomato cages

1841
01:34:52,529 --> 01:34:55,469
yeah they're good mother a good product

1842
01:34:53,970 --> 01:34:58,020
I like them actually might have learned

1843
01:34:55,470 --> 01:35:00,180
about him through some cool hey my

1844
01:34:58,020 --> 01:35:02,370
ninety-nine cents so I can't really

1845
01:35:00,180 --> 01:35:05,159
complain when it's user error trying to

1846
01:35:02,369 --> 01:35:06,779
get it on to something all right that

1847
01:35:05,159 --> 01:35:09,329
was Adams words of the wisdom yep

1848
01:35:06,779 --> 01:35:15,300
so problems you guys were talking about

1849
01:35:09,329 --> 01:35:17,939
moths and worms what the [ __ ] they are

1850
01:35:15,300 --> 01:35:20,130
referred to in America as Kornberg

1851
01:35:17,939 --> 01:35:23,819
borers and here's a little side

1852
01:35:20,130 --> 01:35:27,829
conversation they're actually in Europe

1853
01:35:23,819 --> 01:35:31,199
called ahem poor when Prohibition hit

1854
01:35:27,829 --> 01:35:36,989
the wasn't anymore hint plants around so

1855
01:35:31,199 --> 01:35:41,250
they went for corn and jet you know a

1856
01:35:36,989 --> 01:35:42,960
little bit on here that's not quiet I

1857
01:35:41,250 --> 01:35:45,810
know what a hillbilly knows I don't know

1858
01:35:42,960 --> 01:35:49,199
what a he's about to read for us

1859
01:35:45,810 --> 01:35:52,200
hopefully the European corn borer all

1860
01:35:49,199 --> 01:35:53,909
right yeah I'm just reading it straight

1861
01:35:52,199 --> 01:35:56,489
from Wikipedia the European corn were

1862
01:35:53,909 --> 01:35:58,739
more European corn borer also known as

1863
01:35:56,489 --> 01:36:01,529
the European high flyers a pest of grain

1864
01:35:58,739 --> 01:36:03,449
particularly maize the insect is native

1865
01:36:01,529 --> 01:36:06,389
to Europe originally infesting varieties

1866
01:36:03,449 --> 01:36:10,859
of millet including green card it's an

1867
01:36:06,390 --> 01:36:12,119
ugly [ __ ] bug dude so huge yeah well

1868
01:36:10,859 --> 01:36:13,889
it says the European corn borer

1869
01:36:12,119 --> 01:36:16,470
caterpillars damage the ears of corn as

1870
01:36:13,890 --> 01:36:18,810
well as stalks by chewing tunnels in

1871
01:36:16,470 --> 01:36:21,480
which to which caused the plant to fall

1872
01:36:18,810 --> 01:36:23,610
over biological control agents of corn

1873
01:36:21,479 --> 01:36:25,409
borers include sorry I'm just gonna read

1874
01:36:23,609 --> 01:36:27,779
that part yeah but they dig a tunnel in

1875
01:36:25,409 --> 01:36:29,309
there I can't see and read it all and

1876
01:36:27,779 --> 01:36:31,769
then they lay a little eggs in there and

1877
01:36:29,310 --> 01:36:35,130
then it shows these [ __ ] disgusting

1878
01:36:31,770 --> 01:36:37,290
orange worms that grow out of there this

1879
01:36:35,130 --> 01:36:39,270
is when I got all freaked out like what

1880
01:36:37,289 --> 01:36:41,250
is this dark spot on my plant you know

1881
01:36:39,270 --> 01:36:43,710
this is the kind of stuff that I knew

1882
01:36:41,250 --> 01:36:45,630
that stuff will burrow and lay eggs

1883
01:36:43,710 --> 01:36:46,170
inside of and then rot from the inside

1884
01:36:45,630 --> 01:36:48,800
out

1885
01:36:46,170 --> 01:36:51,930
I've never seen him like in the stalkers

1886
01:36:48,800 --> 01:36:53,220
mine were like right at the base they

1887
01:36:51,930 --> 01:36:56,340
lay clusters of eggs on the leaves

1888
01:36:53,220 --> 01:36:58,020
usually the undersides the egg masses or

1889
01:36:56,340 --> 01:37:00,659
clusters relate an overlap in an

1890
01:36:58,020 --> 01:37:03,450
overlapping configuration a lot of it

1891
01:37:00,659 --> 01:37:04,809
develop inside the eggs become more

1892
01:37:03,449 --> 01:37:06,849
trousseau

1893
01:37:04,810 --> 01:37:10,150
things are ugly they eventually turn

1894
01:37:06,850 --> 01:37:11,560
into a flying insect I believe yeah well

1895
01:37:10,149 --> 01:37:13,179
they fly they land on the plant they

1896
01:37:11,560 --> 01:37:15,100
burrow in or they lay eggs on the bottom

1897
01:37:13,180 --> 01:37:18,039
then they turn to these worms at 200

1898
01:37:15,100 --> 01:37:19,539
plants also so the original flying thing

1899
01:37:18,039 --> 01:37:20,920
eat your plant the new worm they left

1900
01:37:19,539 --> 01:37:22,420
eat your plant and then it turns into a

1901
01:37:20,920 --> 01:37:23,739
flying thing that eat your plant comes

1902
01:37:22,420 --> 01:37:30,460
back and drops more of these [ __ ]

1903
01:37:23,739 --> 01:37:32,849
demon bugs on your plant yeah yeah good

1904
01:37:30,460 --> 01:37:37,359
ways to get rid of them

1905
01:37:32,850 --> 01:37:43,570
prevention is the best way I've came up

1906
01:37:37,359 --> 01:37:45,880
with I've spent hours dude picking them

1907
01:37:43,569 --> 01:37:48,789
out by hand because wow they they

1908
01:37:45,880 --> 01:37:56,289
destroyed you know fortunately it's not

1909
01:37:48,789 --> 01:37:57,850
gonna destroy an entire crop and at the

1910
01:37:56,289 --> 01:37:59,519
end of the year it is very easy to

1911
01:37:57,850 --> 01:38:23,650
locate

1912
01:37:59,520 --> 01:38:25,960
they're looking for our good old friend

1913
01:38:23,649 --> 01:38:28,689
neem oil but it really sucks cuz you're

1914
01:38:25,960 --> 01:38:30,579
spraying neem oil on a flower I was

1915
01:38:28,689 --> 01:38:33,309
gonna ask is that product okay with

1916
01:38:30,579 --> 01:38:35,170
flowers but I mean not anymore

1917
01:38:33,310 --> 01:38:39,880
I know a neem oil doesn't yeah don't put

1918
01:38:35,170 --> 01:38:48,730
neem oil under flowers monterrey what

1919
01:38:39,880 --> 01:38:51,069
can you do yeah I mean it's yeah that's

1920
01:38:48,729 --> 01:38:54,000
that I sprayed my plants with it all

1921
01:38:51,069 --> 01:38:56,229
through veg riously

1922
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:57,760
arranged every four days they got

1923
01:38:56,229 --> 01:39:01,299
sprayed with something different mixed

1924
01:38:57,760 --> 01:39:03,280
it up kept it all the gunk and yep yeah

1925
01:39:01,300 --> 01:39:04,869
so there's something to scare those

1926
01:39:03,279 --> 01:39:08,259
plants away yeah those bugs away

1927
01:39:04,869 --> 01:39:10,750
sorry an ounce of prevention is worth a

1928
01:39:08,260 --> 01:39:13,840
pound of cure that's the God truth there

1929

01:46:26,789 --> 01:46:29,789
girls don't know when to stop talking

2088
01:46:28,350 --> 01:46:30,750
about the growing room that you saw and

2089
01:46:29,789 --> 01:46:32,909
that's not your fault

2090
01:46:30,750 --> 01:46:33,899
I'm a man that's that guy's fault for

2091
01:46:32,909 --> 01:46:35,670
taking into the growing room without

2092
01:46:33,899 --> 01:46:40,069
knowing you well enough I may or may not

2093
01:46:35,670 --> 01:46:43,319
have had a plant snapped in half times

2094
01:46:40,069 --> 01:46:46,380
all right so this leads us to something

2095
01:46:43,319 --> 01:46:48,509
that we all dread other than the police

2096
01:46:46,380 --> 01:46:50,400
in Colorado we don't worry a lot about

2097
01:46:48,510 --> 01:46:51,930
the police anymore we all obey the law

2098
01:46:50,399 --> 01:46:55,199
we either have a medical marijuana card

2099
01:46:51,930 --> 01:46:57,510
or we are an adult in Colorado any adult

2100
01:46:55,199 --> 01:46:58,859
over 21 can grow six plants I think

2101
01:46:57,510 --> 01:47:00,270
you're allowed to grow six plants at any

2102
01:46:58,859 --> 01:47:01,469
house I don't know that if Jesse and I

2103
01:47:00,270 --> 01:47:02,820
lived in the same house I don't know if

2104
01:47:01,470 --> 01:47:05,430
we could grow twelve outside I don't

2105
01:47:02,819 --> 01:47:07,170
know how that works but as a medical

2106
01:47:05,430 --> 01:47:08,369
marijuana provider a lot of us have

2107
01:47:07,170 --> 01:47:10,440
increased counts you look like you might

2108
01:47:08,369 --> 01:47:14,550
have something to add to that I've heard

2109
01:47:10,439 --> 01:47:17,569
it does okay but you know I don't I want

2110
01:47:14,550 --> 01:47:20,070
to be accused of giving anyone illegal

2111
01:47:17,569 --> 01:47:22,349
I'm in that spectrum you know I'm saying

2112
01:47:20,069 --> 01:47:23,849
of where I'm allowed to have six plants

2113
01:47:22,350 --> 01:47:26,550
but I'm allowed to have three flowering

2114
01:47:23,850 --> 01:47:28,200
and three I'm not firing right that's

2115
01:47:26,550 --> 01:47:30,239
the law in Colorado you can have six

2116
01:47:28,199 --> 01:47:33,269
plants three and flower three not in

2117
01:47:30,239 --> 01:47:34,949
flower I don't know the the freaking

2118
01:47:33,270 --> 01:47:36,250
logistics or whatever the bottom into

2119
01:47:34,949 --> 01:47:38,139
the fine print I don't know if

2120
01:47:36,250 --> 01:47:40,149
if Adam and I and Jesse lived together

2121
01:47:38,140 --> 01:47:42,280
can we do 18 plants in the backyard I'm

2122
01:47:40,149 --> 01:47:43,449
not sure they seem to kind of be up on

2123
01:47:42,279 --> 01:47:45,519
that they kind of seem to cock-block

2124
01:47:43,449 --> 01:47:47,199
along those moves they're smart Colin so

2125
01:47:45,520 --> 01:47:49,300
they're catching on anyway

2126
01:47:47,199 --> 01:47:50,769
we digress Jesse's walking so he's

2127
01:47:49,300 --> 01:47:51,940
tiptoeing and his Jordans through the

2128
01:47:50,770 --> 01:47:58,000
kitchen trying to get a bottle of water

2129
01:47:51,939 --> 01:48:08,439
I actually heard a rumor that County is

2130
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:10,600
going to state so that could happen that

2131
01:48:08,439 --> 01:48:12,729
sounds like [ __ ] that Pueblo does but

2132
01:48:10,600 --> 01:48:14,380
yeah so we're allowed to have six plants

2133
01:48:12,729 --> 01:48:15,789
God you just [ __ ] change my whole

2134
01:48:14,380 --> 01:48:18,699
thought process I'm like we're gonna

2135
01:48:15,789 --> 01:48:21,130
have to go political well I got a

2136
01:48:18,699 --> 01:48:25,059
setting with the town hall meeting the

2137
01:48:21,130 --> 01:48:28,930
other day with Sal pace it was pretty

2138
01:48:25,060 --> 01:48:32,140
much a he was campaigning for himself

2139
01:48:28,930 --> 01:48:35,140
but uh ad he did someone brought up

2140
01:48:32,140 --> 01:48:37,510
marijuana and he was real quick to bring

2141
01:48:35,140 --> 01:48:40,240
up the fact that uh they're planning on

2142
01:48:37,510 --> 01:48:43,210
in stating that and so I've already

2143
01:48:40,239 --> 01:48:45,279
called him twice and I left a message at

2144
01:48:43,210 --> 01:48:47,649
the end of the town hall meeting so yeah

2145
01:48:45,279 --> 01:48:49,059
those little tiny hydro plants are like

2146
01:48:47,649 --> 01:48:51,509
six inches tall you wouldn't be able to

2147
01:48:49,060 --> 01:48:53,680
get [ __ ] off it yeah he need

2148
01:48:51,510 --> 01:49:02,710
clarification it was he just talking

2149
01:48:53,680 --> 01:49:03,789
recreational that's okay yeah we'll get

2150
01:49:02,710 --> 01:49:07,270
into this and figure out what's going on

2151
01:49:03,789 --> 01:49:09,340
so far it's just the start we've talked

2152
01:49:07,270 --> 01:49:10,570
about bringing the wrong people to your

2153
01:49:09,340 --> 01:49:12,579
grow we've talked about trying to

2154
01:49:10,569 --> 01:49:15,549
impress chicks here's the biggest

2155
01:49:12,579 --> 01:49:17,800

2157
01:49:17,800 --> 01:49:21,820
gonna happen if you go for three years

2158
01:49:20,649 --> 01:49:23,289
in a row one of those years you're not

2159
01:49:21,819 --> 01:49:26,189
gonna get a harvest it's gonna be

2160
01:49:23,289 --> 01:49:30,729
[ __ ] stolen take a break that's

2161
01:49:26,189 --> 01:49:35,889
that's the old-school rule do two times

2162
01:49:30,729 --> 01:49:38,619
take a break find a spot yeah okay two

2163

2165
01:49:39,760 --> 01:49:42,130
they'll go and look in the really coats

2166
01:49:41,229 --> 01:49:44,859
not here I give up

2167
01:49:42,130 --> 01:49:48,069
all right so things are gonna come your

2168
01:49:44,859 --> 01:49:49,210
garden I don't even want to talk too

2169
01:49:48,069 --> 01:49:50,139
much about this story it's just

2170
01:49:49,210 --> 01:49:51,489
something that needs to be

2171
01:49:50,140 --> 01:49:52,869
recently in our community a

2172
01:49:51,489 --> 01:49:54,789
thirteen-year-old boy was shot in the

2173
01:49:52,869 --> 01:49:57,369
back because he was attempting to steal

2174
01:49:54,789 --> 01:49:59,319
somebody's outdoor marijuana grow the

2175
01:49:57,369 --> 01:50:01,149

2177
01:50:01,149 --> 01:50:04,599
person in the back I wasn't there what

2178
01:50:03,010 --> 01:50:06,579
I'd like to point out this was a pellet

2179
01:50:04,600 --> 01:50:09,010
oh yes it wasn't a high-caliber pellet

2180
01:50:06,579 --> 01:50:12,460
gun pellet is now was not an actual

2181
01:50:09,010 --> 01:50:13,900
firearm right but the pellet is lodged

2182
01:50:12,460 --> 01:50:16,300
in this kid's organs and he had to be

2183
01:50:13,899 --> 01:50:17,469
taken to Denver Children's Hospital to

2184
01:50:16,300 --> 01:50:20,739

critical condition I'm not on either one

2186
01:50:20,739 --> 01:50:23,920
of these guys sides I'm not on the

2187
01:50:22,300 --> 01:50:25,329
shooters side I'm not on the kid's side

2188
01:50:23,920 --> 01:50:27,579
the kid was a thief he was in the yard

2189
01:50:25,329 --> 01:50:29,170
he was actually the newspaper said he

2190
01:50:27,579 --> 01:50:32,079
was out of the yard and he shot him in

2191
01:50:29,170 --> 01:50:33,970
the back but we're just gonna act like

2192
01:50:32,079 --> 01:50:36,340
that he was right next to the pot plants

2193
01:50:33,970 --> 01:50:38,079

2197
01:50:42,640 --> 01:50:48,190

2198
01:50:44,500 --> 01:50:49,390

2203
01:50:54,909 --> 01:50:58,359
days before you cut them down you've got

2204
01:50:56,529 --> 01:50:59,649
a hard-on you're just [ __ ] droolin

2205
01:50:58,359 --> 01:51:01,479
you're rubbing your hands together like

2206
01:50:59,649 --> 01:51:03,099
it's like a porno is strip about to

2207

2208
01:51:03,100 --> 01:51:06,070
cooking you're about to go on the ride

2209
01:51:04,750 --> 01:51:07,810
of your life you got your outdoor crop

2210
01:51:06,069 --> 01:51:09,729
about to come down it's 3:00 in the

2211
01:51:07,810 --> 01:51:12,010
morning you get woken up to the dogs

2212
01:51:09,729 --> 01:51:14,079
going nuts you get woken up to the

2213
01:51:12,010 --> 01:51:15,610
[ __ ] lights coming on you look on

2214
01:51:14,079 --> 01:51:17,409
your security cameras that hopefully you

2215
01:51:15,609 --> 01:51:18,729
have we're gonna talk to a couple in a

2216
01:51:17,409 --> 01:51:19,989
couple of seconds about things to do to

2217
01:51:18,729 --> 01:51:21,639
prevent some thieves but I want to set

2218
01:51:19,989 --> 01:51:23,859
this story here what are you gonna do

2219
01:51:21,640 --> 01:51:25,390
those alarms are going off the [ __ ]

2220
01:51:23,859 --> 01:51:26,859
up on your security camera you can see

2221
01:51:25,390 --> 01:51:29,680
them cutting down your plant he's about

2222
01:51:26,859 --> 01:51:31,000
to it's a [ __ ] 19 year old kid he's

2223
01:51:29,680 --> 01:51:34,450
wearing a black hoodie you can't tell

2224
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:36,039
who he is he's about to run out of your

2225
01:51:34,449 --> 01:51:38,679
yard here in Colorado

2226
01:51:36,039 --> 01:51:42,310
like a 90% chance there's a gun in your

2227
01:51:38,680 --> 01:51:44,860
house probably you got a baseball bat if

2228
01:51:42,310 --> 01:51:46,360
you're a camper you got a machete think

2229
01:51:44,859 --> 01:51:48,759
about what you're gonna do because it it

2230
01:51:46,359 --> 01:51:50,439
could happen to you and you could walk

2231
01:51:48,760 --> 01:51:51,880
out there and put yourself in a more

2232
01:51:50,439 --> 01:51:54,339
dangerous situation than what you're

2233
01:51:51,880 --> 01:51:56,199
ready for you could walk out there and

2234
01:51:54,340 --> 01:51:57,789
be like this guy in our town that shot

2235
01:51:56,199 --> 01:51:59,139
somebody and has to deal with a kid that

2236
01:51:57,789 --> 01:52:00,789
could die right now

2237
01:51:59,140 --> 01:52:02,110
and I don't think that that kid's life

2238
01:52:00,789 --> 01:52:04,000
was worth any

2239
01:52:02,109 --> 01:52:05,349
in my house if you want something I'll

2240
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,550
let you have it when I won't kill you

2241
01:52:05,350 --> 01:52:08,500
and that sounds like something [ __ ]

2242
01:52:06,550 --> 01:52:10,449
stupid to say but if you need it that

2243
01:52:08,500 --> 01:52:12,189
bad it's not worth killing me for I'll

2244
01:52:10,448 --> 01:52:13,689
make more money I'll grow more next year

2245
01:52:12,189 --> 01:52:17,408
leave my mother plants in my seeds where

2246
01:52:13,689 --> 01:52:19,059
they are will be just fine you haven't

2247
01:52:17,408 --> 01:52:22,059
liked that where is somebody like me who

2248
01:52:19,060 --> 01:52:24,219
is depending you know on those three

2249
01:52:22,060 --> 01:52:27,610
plants not only for me but for my old

2250
01:52:24,219 --> 01:52:31,810
lady you know and it's it would be rough

2251
01:52:27,609 --> 01:52:33,279
for that you know I'm trying to put that

2252
01:52:31,810 --> 01:52:34,810
story in these growers heads now these

2253
01:52:33,279 --> 01:52:36,789
new folks had said haven't had to deal

2254
01:52:34,810 --> 01:52:40,719
with this let me break it down from the

2255
01:52:36,789 --> 01:52:42,250
from the suspects perspective he's you

2256
01:52:40,719 --> 01:52:47,340
know he got woken up at 2:30 in the

2257
01:52:42,250 --> 01:52:49,329
morning he grabbed her of BB gun and he

2258
01:52:47,340 --> 01:52:51,850
shot someone in his yard

2259
01:52:49,329 --> 01:52:54,069
protecting his plants in an effort to

2260
01:52:51,850 --> 01:52:57,100
protect his plants well the cops showed

2261
01:52:54,069 --> 01:52:59,500
up because he shot someone and the cop

2262
01:52:57,100 --> 01:53:03,159
saw his plants and he shot someone and

2263
01:52:59,500 --> 01:53:06,010
the cops realized that he valued his

2264
01:53:03,158 --> 01:53:07,988
plants more than he valued human life so

2265
01:53:06,010 --> 01:53:12,310
now he's sitting in a jail cell because

2266
01:53:07,988 --> 01:53:16,809
these people otherwise didn't you know

2267
01:53:12,310 --> 01:53:24,190
he was yeah well I'm highly conflicted

2268
01:53:16,810 --> 01:53:24,730
on this I don't even if he gets away

2269
01:53:24,189 --> 01:53:27,219
with it

2270
01:53:24,729 --> 01:53:28,928
his face has been on the paper his

2271
01:53:27,219 --> 01:53:31,179
plants are still there everyone in town

2272
01:53:28,929 --> 01:53:33,039
knows they're there the cops won't touch

2273
01:53:31,179 --> 01:53:36,190
him because they're not gonna maintain

2274
01:53:33,039 --> 01:53:38,710
that evidence so he's gonna just spend

2275
01:53:36,189 --> 01:53:42,009
lower fees he probably lost his job his

2276
01:53:38,710 --> 01:53:44,560
dad's been on the news and even if he

2277
01:53:42,010 --> 01:53:52,810
gets away with it all he still lost his

2278
01:53:44,560 --> 01:53:58,539
plants was it worth it I mean so just

2279
01:53:52,810 --> 01:54:02,670
don't do it yeah like you know you just

2280
01:53:58,539 --> 01:54:02,670
coming out the door with the pellet gun

2281
01:54:08,219 --> 01:54:11,600
you can walk out put yourself in worse

2282
01:54:10,569 --> 01:54:12,979
danger than what you

2283
01:54:11,600 --> 01:54:15,410
prepared for to deal with for those

2284
01:54:12,979 --> 01:54:18,229
plants and if you love your dogs don't

2285
01:54:15,409 --> 01:54:20,899
turn them out either yep yeah plants

2286
01:54:18,229 --> 01:54:28,159
like it this sucks man it's happened to

2287
01:54:20,899 --> 01:54:31,099
me they're gonna run off hopefully turn

2288
01:54:28,159 --> 01:54:33,319
the lights on yeah if you can get a good

2289
01:54:31,100 --> 01:54:35,270
look at the situation try to scare them

2290
01:54:33,319 --> 01:54:36,590
off you know maybe he's gotta elevated

2291
01:54:35,270 --> 01:54:38,830
you know maybe you can walk out on a

2292
01:54:36,590 --> 01:54:41,390
back balcony or shot like that you know

2293
01:54:38,829 --> 01:54:54,199
just scaring them off you know throwing

2294
01:54:41,390 --> 01:54:56,560
a rock at him I don't see you know with

2295
01:54:54,199 --> 01:55:01,069
the damn hand sighs Rock and probably

2296
01:54:56,560 --> 01:55:02,570
that's true that's true yeah that's my

2297
01:55:01,069 --> 01:55:04,009
point is think about be prepared what

2298
01:55:02,569 --> 01:55:06,019
you're gonna do because I don't want you

2299
01:55:04,010 --> 01:55:07,430
to have to the only way to be prepared

2300
01:55:06,020 --> 01:55:09,110
for that situation is to think about it

2301
01:55:07,430 --> 01:55:10,039
today while I'm telling you about it so

2302
01:55:09,109 --> 01:55:11,359
that when someone's in your yard

2303
01:55:10,039 --> 01:55:14,510
stealing your [ __ ] you don't panic and

2304
01:55:11,359 --> 01:55:15,920
[ __ ] your pants hopefully if you prepare

2305
01:55:14,510 --> 01:55:18,079
for it think about it you've got a plan

2306
01:55:15,920 --> 01:55:19,279
of action you know how to get out there

2307
01:55:18,079 --> 01:55:21,289
quickly you know how to get rid of a

2308
01:55:19,279 --> 01:55:22,849
thief I don't want anybody to try to be

2309
01:55:21,289 --> 01:55:24,649
your hero for a pot plant I don't want

2310
01:55:22,850 --> 01:55:26,539
to hear about anybody else shoot more

2311
01:55:24,649 --> 01:55:27,710
people for weed plants we don't need

2312
01:55:26,539 --> 01:55:31,090
that kind of publicity

2313
01:55:27,710 --> 01:55:38,899
I think the gangs in jail for you know

2314
01:55:31,090 --> 01:55:42,890
anything industry yeah just yes we don't

2315
01:55:38,899 --> 01:55:44,779
need that so in Colorado we shouldn't be

2316
01:55:42,890 --> 01:55:47,300
growing enough to make it worth robbing

2317
01:55:44,779 --> 01:55:51,069
us which that sounds weird yeah and and

2318
01:55:47,300 --> 01:55:51,070
don't don't we're not defending thieves

2319
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:59,060
yeah they are the lowest you know we

2320
01:55:56,180 --> 01:56:01,250
worked so hard for what we have and in

2321
01:55:59,060 --> 01:56:03,590
one night in a couple hours they take it

2322
01:56:01,250 --> 01:56:05,270
all away from you and you know they

2323
01:56:03,590 --> 01:56:06,680
leave it scattered down in your alley so

2324
01:56:05,270 --> 01:56:09,200
you have to clean it up at 8 o'clock in

2325
01:56:06,680 --> 01:56:10,789
the morning and your neighbors you know

2326
01:56:09,199 --> 01:56:13,429
finally realized what this but you know

2327
01:56:10,789 --> 01:56:15,050
it's just it's not worth it yeah I've

2328
01:56:13,430 --> 01:56:16,730
had one plan taken from me I've grown

2329
01:56:15,050 --> 01:56:19,329
one plant outside got something I got

2330
01:56:16,729 --> 01:56:21,739

2331
01:56:19,329 --> 01:56:23,319

2332
01:56:21,739 --> 01:56:24,670
backyard tucked away

2333
01:56:23,319 --> 01:56:28,869
the gardener's are the ones that [ __ ]

2334
01:56:24,670 --> 01:56:31,869
took that yeah yeah like I have never

2335
01:56:28,869 --> 01:56:34,510
grown in my own yard before or anything

2336
01:56:31,869 --> 01:56:38,529
like that and the year I tried it it got

2337
01:56:34,510 --> 01:56:41,079
taken so three plants so damn yeah so I

2338
01:56:38,529 --> 01:56:42,819
guess we scared the [ __ ] just be

2339
01:56:41,079 --> 01:56:43,899
prepared guys I'm not I don't know what

2340
01:56:42,819 --> 01:56:45,069
you're gonna do I don't want you to

2341
01:56:43,899 --> 01:56:46,479
shoot people I don't want you to fight

2342
01:56:45,069 --> 01:56:49,059
people I want you to protect your crop

2343
01:56:46,479 --> 01:56:52,179
peacefully use your voice scare the [ __ ]

2344
01:56:49,060 --> 01:56:57,850
out of them at your cousin or I'll beat

2345
01:56:52,180 --> 01:56:59,950
his [ __ ] ass example if you're

2346
01:56:57,850 --> 01:57:01,480
stealing Adams plants and he catches you

2347
01:56:59,949 --> 01:57:03,429
Adams [ __ ] if he walks out and tries

2348
01:57:01,479 --> 01:57:05,139
to stop you if Adams stealing your

2349
01:57:03,430 --> 01:57:08,950
plants and you catch him Adam is [ __ ]

2350
01:57:05,140 --> 01:57:11,170
if you try the array of outcomes could

2351
01:57:08,949 --> 01:57:13,359
be very broad if there's a thief in your

2352
01:57:11,170 --> 01:57:15,220
yard cuz but then again me knowing that

2353
01:57:13,359 --> 01:57:16,779
I'm going to steal his plants I'm not

2354
01:57:15,220 --> 01:57:18,610
probably not coming with just my little

2355
01:57:16,779 --> 01:57:21,250
mini arms either right I'm saying that's

2356
01:57:18,609 --> 01:57:28,399
and but you're going to his house so you

2357
01:57:21,250 --> 01:57:29,819
know he's got more than his big ass yeah

2358
01:57:28,399 --> 01:57:35,739
[Music]

2359
01:57:29,819 --> 01:57:37,719
yeah outside next month or next year

2360
01:57:35,739 --> 01:57:39,819
yeah try again next year

2361
01:57:37,720 --> 01:57:41,590
girl doors so don't shoot thieves that's

2362
01:57:39,819 --> 01:57:43,750
my advice please jail sucks you don't

2363
01:57:41,590 --> 01:57:45,670
want to go to jail we need to talk about

2364
01:57:43,750 --> 01:57:49,229
if we don't want to lose our plants and

2365
01:57:45,670 --> 01:57:52,420
treat people how can we prevent this

2366
01:57:49,229 --> 01:57:54,519
dogs right Big John dogs in your

2367
01:57:52,420 --> 01:57:56,829
backyard keeping them through that night

2368
01:57:54,520 --> 01:58:00,670
don't you're gonna use them as security

2369
01:57:56,829 --> 01:58:02,590
don't believe them you know don't you

2370
01:58:00,670 --> 01:58:04,300
know these these are working dogs they

2371
01:58:02,590 --> 01:58:06,699
need to stay outside and have a good dog

2372
01:58:04,300 --> 01:58:07,659
house it's summer yeah yeah it's summer

2373
01:58:06,699 --> 01:58:10,569
in Colorado they should be outside

2374
01:58:07,659 --> 01:58:12,159
protecting your [ __ ] yeah I like a

2375
01:58:10,569 --> 01:58:14,679
mixture of big dogs and little bugs

2376
01:58:12,159 --> 01:58:17,470
those little yappy dogs they wake up the

2377
01:58:14,680 --> 01:58:20,720
big ones and then and then it's on

2378
01:58:17,470 --> 01:58:23,829
yeah [ __ ] big pit bulls have come to

2379
01:58:20,720 --> 01:58:26,720
business we've got one he doesn't sleep

2380
01:58:23,829 --> 01:58:33,769
during the night during the summer he's

2381
01:58:26,720 --> 01:58:35,630
just gotten those crops are important so

2382
01:58:33,770 --> 01:58:38,660
also if your dog bites somebody you're

2383
01:58:35,630 --> 01:58:40,010
gonna have to [ __ ] deal with that put

2384
01:58:38,659 --> 01:58:42,439
your dog in quarantine make it as a nap

2385
01:58:40,010 --> 01:58:43,730
make sure it doesn't have rabies if your

2386
01:58:42,439 --> 01:58:44,839
dog really eats the [ __ ] out of somebody

2387
01:58:43,729 --> 01:58:48,199
hopefully it doesn't come to that

2388
01:58:44,840 --> 01:58:50,690
hopefully I want to use two dogs as

2389
01:58:48,199 --> 01:58:52,369
examples if I got into a yard and Ciroc

2390
01:58:50,689 --> 01:58:54,889
and Nana rushed me and barked at me I

2391
01:58:52,369 --> 01:58:57,349
would be gone I'm not a very good runner

2392
01:58:54,890 --> 01:58:59,600
but I would run a record lap with those

2393
01:58:57,350 --> 01:59:00,620
two dogs behind me so hopefully that's

2394
01:58:59,600 --> 01:59:04,130
all you gotta do though

2395
01:59:00,619 --> 01:59:05,809
yeah lights and cameras for your best

2396
01:59:04,130 --> 01:59:07,159
friend white some cameras or anybody's

2397
01:59:05,810 --> 01:59:08,780
best friend if you live in a sketchy

2398
01:59:07,159 --> 01:59:09,680
hood put some lights and cameras up on

2399
01:59:08,779 --> 01:59:12,050

the middle of the night it is and

2411
02:00:12,350 --> 02:00:17,660
they're doing something you know they're

2412
02:00:14,960 --> 02:00:20,480
breaking two or three rules and and laws

2413
02:00:17,659 --> 02:00:22,039
and all kinds of [ __ ] it's not gonna

2414
02:00:20,479 --> 02:00:23,359
take much to spook them and it's likely

2415
02:00:22,039 --> 02:00:24,229
somebody you know so they don't want you

2416
02:00:23,359 --> 02:00:25,789
to see their face

2417
02:00:24,229 --> 02:00:27,379

2420
02:00:29,559 --> 02:00:37,809
another when mine got taken uh they were

2421
02:00:33,368 --> 02:00:40,118
heavily heavily bamboo I had uh you know

2422
02:00:37,809 --> 02:00:44,349
kind of ADA they will freaking Bush

2423
02:00:40,118 --> 02:00:47,228
outta one little thing and the bamboos

2424
02:00:44,349 --> 02:00:50,229
actually played it was hard for them to

2425
02:00:47,229 --> 02:00:52,088
pull the plants out you know I still had

2426
02:00:50,229 --> 02:00:56,949
you know a couple branches left to each

2427
02:00:52,088 --> 02:00:57,698
one you know so the bamboo serve couple

2428
02:00:56,948 --> 02:00:59,918
purposes

2429
02:00:57,698 --> 02:01:01,538
oh go ahead you might be leading to what

2430
02:00:59,918 --> 02:01:06,368
I was gonna say if they ever tripped and

2431
02:01:01,538 --> 02:01:12,668
fell onto you know it works good for the

2432
02:01:06,368 --> 02:01:14,259
VC so a great point Jesse brought up

2433
02:01:12,668 --> 02:01:16,389

daint crop in the backyard they got to

2445
02:01:35,498 --> 02:01:38,738

2446
02:01:36,939 --> 02:01:40,628
they won't steal it from you cuz some

2447
02:01:38,738 --> 02:01:41,888
neighbors will check your [ __ ] but then

2448
02:01:40,628 --> 02:01:43,358
maybe if someone does come in the yard

2449
02:01:41,889 --> 02:01:44,800
they'll help you out also they'll keep

2450
02:01:43,359 --> 02:01:46,780
an eye on that [ __ ] because they know

2451
02:01:44,800 --> 02:01:48,189
that they've been keeping an eye on it

2452
02:01:46,779 --> 02:01:49,658
maybe you'll throw them an ounce or two

2453
02:01:48,189 --> 02:01:51,849
when it gets done maybe they'll come

2454
02:01:49,658 --> 02:02:02,469
over and help you trim you know our

2455
02:01:51,849 --> 02:02:05,019
neighbors on the farmer like so I made a

2456
02:02:02,469 --> 02:02:06,429
little spike shape on my paper here to

2457
02:02:05,019 --> 02:02:07,689
remind me to talk about something a lot

2458
02:02:06,429 --> 02:02:10,389
of you guys are gonna set some kind of

2459
02:02:07,689 --> 02:02:12,338
weird booby traps or some kind of thumbs

2460
02:02:10,389 --> 02:02:13,958
for the thieves to get hurt don't do

2461
02:02:12,338 --> 02:02:15,939
that yeah we can't condone that

2462
02:02:13,958 --> 02:02:17,318
that's just like shooting somebody it's

2463
02:02:15,939 --> 02:02:19,418
just like let your dogs out you're gonna

2464
02:02:17,319 --> 02:02:21,849
get in trouble for that you don't get

2465
02:02:19,418 --> 02:02:25,868
manslaughter I think there's also ten

2466
02:02:21,849 --> 02:02:26,199
places called man trapping don't don't

2467
02:02:25,868 --> 02:02:29,348
do it

2468
02:02:26,198 --> 02:02:31,299
yeah and it really really pisses cops

2469
02:02:29,349 --> 02:02:32,949
off when they see it because they think

2470
02:02:31,300 --> 02:02:36,069
oh I could have stepped on that that's

2471
02:02:32,948 --> 02:02:37,538
mm especially if you're in a legal state

2472
02:02:36,069 --> 02:02:39,399
you know what if they what does they

2473
02:02:37,538 --> 02:02:40,929
arrest you at the front door you know

2474
02:02:39,399 --> 02:02:42,140
and they lead you to the car and they

2475
02:02:40,929 --> 02:02:44,569
just go walking around

2476
02:02:42,140 --> 02:02:46,400
it's dark you know I mean step on

2477
02:02:44,569 --> 02:02:48,739
whatever you put in you just assaulted a

2478
02:02:46,399 --> 02:02:50,679
police officer it wasn't not not doing

2479
02:02:48,739 --> 02:02:54,590
anything you're handcuffed yep

2480
02:02:50,680 --> 02:02:56,450
let's if if you're doing things like

2481
02:02:54,590 --> 02:02:59,150
this that's you've probably got a

2482
02:02:56,449 --> 02:03:01,069
substantial crop and you probably doing

2483
02:02:59,149 --> 02:03:02,899
a lot of things wrong and you're not

2484
02:03:01,069 --> 02:03:04,759
really doing anyone but your sofa

2485
02:03:02,899 --> 02:03:06,170
there's those somebody showed me a

2486
02:03:04,760 --> 02:03:08,420
Google map I might have talked about

2487
02:03:06,170 --> 02:03:12,340
this a Google map where there's a

2488
02:03:08,420 --> 02:03:16,010
community in NorCal dude set up like

2489
02:03:12,340 --> 02:03:17,720
lots of housing it's like Jesse owns one

2490
02:03:16,010 --> 02:03:22,460
lot Adam owns another I owned another

2491
02:03:17,720 --> 02:03:24,050
but divided all this land and set up

2492
02:03:22,460 --> 02:03:26,480
gigantic crops

2493
02:03:24,050 --> 02:03:28,340
looks like you built it looks like one

2494
02:03:26,479 --> 02:03:31,069
guy set up all these crops for all these

2495
02:03:28,340 --> 02:03:33,440
families so those guys have a lot on the

2496
02:03:31,069 --> 02:03:35,809
line man what if somebody goes in there

2497
02:03:33,439 --> 02:03:37,519
and tries to take ten of those plants

2498
02:03:35,810 --> 02:03:39,590
they've got a lot to [ __ ] lose those

2499
02:03:37,520 --> 02:03:42,470
are five ten pound plants each yeah I

2500
02:03:39,590 --> 02:03:45,350
would hope at that point of scale you

2501
02:03:42,470 --> 02:03:47,480
know you can pay two dudes to sit around

2502
02:03:45,350 --> 02:03:50,870
with flashlights like the ones awake in

2503
02:03:47,479 --> 02:03:52,219
oil I don't even want to set up the

2504

scene for a shitty movie but that's a

2505
02:03:52,220 --> 02:03:57,140
lot of money on that mountain bro

2506
02:03:53,949 --> 02:03:59,179
there's a sure window when it's done and

2507
02:03:57,140 --> 02:04:00,410
not harvested but could be cut when the

2508
02:03:59,180 --> 02:04:03,470
growers are trying to let it get that

2509

of that show bro

2614
02:09:10,399 --> 02:09:15,589
it was awesome dude i I've never seen a

2615
02:09:13,760 --> 02:09:17,329
professional comic so to say you know

2616
02:09:15,590 --> 02:09:19,880
I'm saying besides when we went up to

2617
02:09:17,329 --> 02:09:21,800
Denver but it was great man I woke up in

2618
02:09:19,880 --> 02:09:23,779
my cheeks and my ribs were still sore

2619
02:09:21,800 --> 02:09:25,039
from laughing so hard absolute my cheeks

2620
02:09:23,779 --> 02:09:26,929
yeah

2621
02:09:25,039 --> 02:09:29,800
Tony Hinchcliffe opened up for Joe Rogan

2622
02:09:26,930 --> 02:09:32,240
at Comedy Works last night he did 15

2623
02:09:29,800 --> 02:09:34,279
solid minutes every second of his set

2624
02:09:32,239 --> 02:09:35,420
was ripping you know it was he was a

2625
02:09:34,279 --> 02:09:36,829
funny dude I've never heard of him

2626
02:09:35,420 --> 02:09:38,810
before but he was definitely an

2627
02:09:36,829 --> 02:09:43,729
interesting comic he's a little dark

2628
02:09:38,810 --> 02:09:45,620
he's a little twisted so that was

2629
02:09:43,729 --> 02:09:48,799
perfect and then of course Joe Rogan is

2630
02:09:45,619 --> 02:09:53,739
a legend he crushed it yeah he came out

2631
02:09:48,800 --> 02:09:53,739
a little bit nervous I felt like he used

2632
02:09:55,359 --> 02:10:00,229
somebody tried to heckle Joe Rogan about

2633
02:09:58,399 --> 02:10:02,029
10 minutes into a set and that's when he

2634
02:10:00,229 --> 02:10:04,189
calmed he totally broke free of the

2635
02:10:02,029 --> 02:10:05,989
level of I'm recording a show and he

2636
02:10:04,189 --> 02:10:07,369
kind of chewed that lady a tiny bit of a

2637
02:10:05,989 --> 02:10:08,989
chewing of a new [ __ ] he just made

2638
02:10:07,369 --> 02:10:10,460
her feel really stupid for a second like

2639
02:10:08,989 --> 02:10:12,859
a comedian should do and went back about

2640
02:10:10,460 --> 02:10:15,590
his business I had a hell of a good time

2641
02:10:12,859 --> 02:10:17,239
so shout out to Joe Rogan it's gonna be

2642
02:10:15,590 --> 02:10:21,319
a great comedy spent Comedy Works is it

want someone to listen to we've got

2756
02:14:13,149 --> 02:14:20,979
great radio voices absolutely but yeah

2757
02:14:18,548 --> 02:14:23,588
you can spread the word so all 1100 of

2758
02:14:20,979 --> 02:14:25,389
you a thousand of you 1500 by the time

2759
02:14:23,588 --> 02:14:27,488
this episode posts all of you guys tell

2760
02:14:25,389 --> 02:14:29,469
two people and that way if one of them

2761
02:14:27,488 --> 02:14:30,908
listens to the show then we got three

2762
02:14:29,469 --> 02:14:32,408
thousand listeners and that's when

2763
02:14:30,908 --> 02:14:34,118
iTunes and stitcher really start paying

2764
02:14:32,408 --> 02:14:35,888
attention once you break that 2500

2765
02:14:34,118 --> 02:14:37,988
marker and that's that's all the the

2766
02:14:35,889 --> 02:14:40,029
ratings is really doing I mean it tells

2767
02:14:37,988 --> 02:14:43,259
people that the show is good but more

2768
02:14:40,029 --> 02:14:46,029
than anything else that helps your

2769
02:14:43,260 --> 02:14:47,619
relationship with iTunes or stitcher but

2770
02:14:46,029 --> 02:14:49,659
when it moves us up in the ranking it

2771
02:14:47,618 --> 02:14:51,368
shows people that we exist and then it's

2772
02:14:49,658 --> 02:14:53,198
like it's just our brand has more

2773
02:14:51,368 --> 02:14:54,998
integrity if more people are listening

2774
02:14:53,198 --> 02:14:57,009
people say oh people are listening it

2775
02:14:54,998 --> 02:14:57,800
must be worth listening and so you know

2776
02:14:57,010 --> 02:15:00,139
nobody you know

2777
02:14:57,800 --> 02:15:01,699
when you're seeing a killer band nobody

2778
02:15:00,139 --> 02:15:07,309
wants to dance until that first idiot

2779
02:15:01,698 --> 02:15:09,078
dances mm-hmm just dance guys get out

2780
02:15:07,309 --> 02:15:10,519
there and dance because people far

2781
02:15:09,078 --> 02:15:12,288
behind yeah yeah

2782
02:15:10,519 --> 02:15:14,119
nobody wants to be the first dancer but

2783
02:15:12,288 --> 02:15:15,469
those fifth and tenth dancers those guys

2784
02:15:14,118 --> 02:15:22,130
are all gonna love you for a break in

2785
02:15:15,469 --> 02:15:23,658
the ice so I just want more people can

2786
02:15:22,130 --> 02:15:25,998
learn how to grow high grade cannabis

2787
02:15:23,658 --> 02:15:27,288
less people will be afraid of cannabis

2788
02:15:25,998 --> 02:15:29,899
and more people will be properly

2789
02:15:27,288 --> 02:15:32,779
educated about cannabis and the things

2790
02:15:29,899 --> 02:15:34,368
that go with cannabis that's my goal I

2791
02:15:32,779 --> 02:15:34,670

2939
02:22:23,738 --> 02:22:37,689

2940
02:22:34,359 --> 02:22:40,988
your know if totally not yeah yeah I

2941
02:22:37,689 --> 02:22:44,408
just I feel that because I'm a red card

2942
02:22:40,988 --> 02:22:46,328
patient and the place that has my my

2943
02:22:44,408 --> 02:22:48,549
card or the place that I like to go to

2944
02:22:46,328 --> 02:22:51,488
anyways my preferred place is now

2945
02:22:48,549 --> 02:22:53,618
recreational and it's uh it's a line

2946
02:22:51,488 --> 02:22:55,840
there's a line to get in to get your

2947
02:22:53,619 --> 02:22:58,359
meds it's the same place you know they

2948
02:22:55,840 --> 02:23:00,040
can only take the same one to people

2949
02:22:58,359 --> 02:23:01,930
back at one time and it's the same

2950
02:23:00,040 --> 02:23:04,569
building same how long does that line

2951
02:23:01,930 --> 02:23:06,220
take you now I've been out there since

2952
02:23:04,568 --> 02:23:08,350
they've really done in besides one or

2953
02:23:06,219 --> 02:23:10,000
two times one time I've walked right in

2954
02:23:08,350 --> 02:23:12,430
there cuz there was nobody on there but

2955
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:14,049
the other times there's been five or six

2956
02:23:12,430 --> 02:23:16,210
people ahead of me and people walk in

2957
02:23:14,049 --> 02:23:18,578
behind me and they're like oh no and

2958
02:23:16,209 --> 02:23:20,019
they turn to walk out yeah that's a long

2959
02:23:18,578 --> 02:23:21,699
time to wait we used at a shop downtown

2960
02:23:20,020 --> 02:23:23,470
they're not hurt and for the business

2961
02:23:21,699 --> 02:23:24,908
people would wait in line for an hour

2962
02:23:23,469 --> 02:23:26,828
because the whole front of the place

2963
02:23:24,908 --> 02:23:29,350
would be full all right I'm gonna get in

2964
02:23:26,828 --> 02:23:30,459
this article a little bit right it says

2965
02:23:29,350 --> 02:23:32,920
rhinorrhea Ryan

2966
02:23:30,459 --> 02:23:34,770
Griego owns a recreational pot shop in

2967
02:23:32,920 --> 02:23:37,260
Covent Southern Colorado

2968
02:23:34,771 --> 02:23:39,510
and he's putting out a bold informed

2969
02:23:37,260 --> 02:23:41,640
estimate saying that decidedly decidedly

2970
02:23:39,510 --> 02:23:43,351
clear majority of his customers are from

2971
02:23:41,640 --> 02:23:44,579
outside of Colorado I'm gonna take a big

2972
02:23:43,351 --> 02:23:47,641
breath here cuz I can't even read after

2973
02:23:44,579 --> 02:23:49,289
that dab I think the dispensary this guy

2974
02:23:47,640 --> 02:23:51,119
is from is actually they posted a really

2975
02:23:49,290 --> 02:23:53,370
cool shot of the can ASSU and this

2976
02:23:51,120 --> 02:23:55,170
article online here a really cool angle

2977
02:23:53,370 --> 02:23:56,400
of the sign and the building stylish

2978
02:23:55,170 --> 02:23:59,640
looking place with a great Colorado

2979
02:23:56,399 --> 02:24:02,039
background is that a dope shot a dope

2980
02:23:59,640 --> 02:24:04,500
shot right haha I didn't even mean that

2981
02:24:02,040 --> 02:24:06,540
pun alright I'm back on my game let's go

2982
02:24:04,500 --> 02:24:08,489
80% of my customers are coming from

2983
02:24:06,540 --> 02:24:10,950
other states predominantly Texas New

2984
02:24:08,489 --> 02:24:13,199
Mexico Kansas and Erica Arizona said

2985
02:24:10,950 --> 02:24:15,420
Griego owner of Kennesaw and pueblos

2986
02:24:13,200 --> 02:24:17,670
West which opened its doors in May for

2987
02:24:15,420 --> 02:24:18,960
recreational marijuana sales I knew

2988
02:24:17,670 --> 02:24:20,729
there would be out-of-state customers

2989
02:24:18,959 --> 02:24:23,310
coming in but I thought what thought it

2990
02:24:20,729 --> 02:24:25,140
would be more of a 30/70 split with 30%

2991
02:24:23,310 --> 02:24:27,149
of my customers from out of state but

2992
02:24:25,140 --> 02:24:27,720
it's more severe than that on the flip

2993
02:24:27,149 --> 02:24:30,750
flop

2994
02:24:27,720 --> 02:24:32,760
I don't think severe was right how does

2995
02:24:30,750 --> 02:24:34,530
the tourists account for 44% of all

2996
02:24:32,760 --> 02:24:37,050
retail sales and dinner in the Denver

2997
02:24:34,530 --> 02:24:39,391
area at about 90% in mountain resorts

2998
02:24:37,049 --> 02:24:41,100
such as Aspen or Telluride according to

2999
02:24:39,390 --> 02:24:43,409
a recent study produced by the Colorado

3000
02:24:41,101 --> 02:24:45,120
marijuana Enforcement Division as we've

3001
02:24:43,409 --> 02:24:47,729
talked about the marijuana Enforcement

3002
02:24:45,120 --> 02:24:49,561
Division or the Med they're the guys the

3003
02:24:47,729 --> 02:24:52,829
division in charge of regulating the

3004
02:24:49,560 --> 02:24:54,420
dispensaries and the grows and all of

3005
02:24:52,829 --> 02:24:56,610
that stuff they are in charge of the

3006
02:24:54,420 --> 02:24:58,110
marijuana and they regulate all of that

3007
02:24:56,610 --> 02:25:02,550
stuff they make the rules and they are

3008
02:24:58,110 --> 02:25:04,110
also are also a branch of the IRS so

3009
02:25:02,549 --> 02:25:06,180
that's pretty legit they're a huge place

3010
02:25:04,110 --> 02:25:08,670
that make a lot of rules they [ __ ]

3011
02:25:06,181 --> 02:25:10,980
put their foot down and it matters guys

3012
02:25:08,670 --> 02:25:12,870
tweet me every time I say the f-word

3013
02:25:10,979 --> 02:25:14,220
every time I say [ __ ] just tweet me and

3014
02:25:12,870 --> 02:25:15,710
tell me to stop doing it please go I'm

3015
02:25:14,220 --> 02:25:17,430
trying to stop doing that on the show

3016
02:25:15,709 --> 02:25:19,199
trying to cut that word out of my

3017
02:25:17,431 --> 02:25:23,010
vocabulary it's not even a cool word to

3018
02:25:19,200 --> 02:25:25,230
use for anything but anyway but for a

3019
02:25:23,010 --> 02:25:26,819
shop in Pueblo hardly considered in the

3020
02:25:25,229 --> 02:25:28,709
same tourism league as Aspen or

3021
02:25:26,819 --> 02:25:30,239
Telluride to make 80 percent of its

3022
02:25:28,709 --> 02:25:32,909
sales to out-of-state visitors is

3023
02:25:30,239 --> 02:25:34,140
something an oven anomaly even given

3024
02:25:32,909 --> 02:25:36,329
Pablo's proximity

3025
02:25:34,140 --> 02:25:38,699
less than 100 miles to the New Mexico

3026
02:25:36,329 --> 02:25:40,649
State Line they're not joking at all

3027
02:25:38,700 --> 02:25:43,971
about the differences between Aspen till

3028
02:25:40,649 --> 02:25:46,229
you ride compared to Pueblo Pueblo is

3029
02:25:43,970 --> 02:25:48,529
it's a cool place if you live here and

3030
02:25:46,229 --> 02:25:50,118
you know where you're going but is a

3031
02:25:48,529 --> 02:25:51,680
to steal town it's a steel mill town

3032
02:25:50,119 --> 02:25:53,779
it's a blue-collar working man's town

3033
02:25:51,680 --> 02:25:55,338
and Aspen and Telluride are places where

3034
02:25:53,779 --> 02:25:58,189
you go to spend some time we don't have

3035
02:25:55,338 --> 02:25:59,600
we have a reservoir here we've got a

3036
02:25:58,189 --> 02:26:04,059
Riverwalk here we've got some really

3037
02:25:59,600 --> 02:26:05,988
cool trails and things there's a castle

3038
02:26:04,059 --> 02:26:11,269
definitely nice to come and see but

3039
02:26:05,988 --> 02:26:13,189
there's nothing here to like oh it has

3040
02:26:11,270 --> 02:26:15,588
everything that a normal town has and

3041
02:26:13,189 --> 02:26:17,088
it's pretty yeah so to say that eighty

3042
02:26:15,588 --> 02:26:19,129
percent of our sales are going to

3043
02:26:17,088 --> 02:26:21,020
out-of-state visitors is kind of

3044
02:26:19,129 --> 02:26:23,720
shocking well we have a lot of

3045
02:26:21,020 --> 02:26:25,668
recreational weed shops here in the shop

3046
02:26:23,719 --> 02:26:29,418
that you're talking about is 100 percent

3047
02:26:25,668 --> 02:26:30,889
recreational so do you think that the

3048
02:26:29,418 --> 02:26:32,628
numbers are the same across the board at

3049
02:26:30,889 --> 02:26:33,378
the shops at the rec shops that it's

3050
02:26:32,629 --> 02:26:34,789
70/30

3051
02:26:33,379 --> 02:26:36,350
I think it depends on your product

3052
02:26:34,789 --> 02:26:38,659
that's true and that's something I was

3053
02:26:36,350 --> 02:26:40,488
gonna get at because the reason that the

3054
02:26:38,658 --> 02:26:43,609
Colorado market is not shopping in a

3055
02:26:40,488 --> 02:26:44,898
recreational shop we are either and I

3056
02:26:43,609 --> 02:26:46,430
haven't read this article in advance

3057
02:26:44,898 --> 02:26:47,838
very well I skimmed it because if I

3058
02:26:46,430 --> 02:26:50,270
found it interesting for the show I

3059
02:26:47,838 --> 02:26:51,918
think that a Colorado resident like you

3060
02:26:50,270 --> 02:26:53,479
did you became a resident you got your

3061
02:26:51,918 --> 02:26:54,978
medical marijuana recommendation from

3062
02:26:53,478 --> 02:26:56,778
the doctor you've got your red card now

3063
02:26:54,978 --> 02:26:59,538
you can shop at a medical shop and not

3064
02:26:56,779 --> 02:27:03,229
pay the 25 percent tax that's added on

3065
02:26:59,539 --> 02:27:04,789
to the REC weed and probably you get

3066
02:27:03,228 --> 02:27:08,148
better herb there I think if the Med

3067
02:27:04,789 --> 02:27:10,129
shops but also most of the Colorado

3068
02:27:08,148 --> 02:27:17,059
residents have been here and we have a

3069
02:27:10,129 --> 02:27:20,088
guy or a caregiver or just I literally

3070
02:27:17,059 --> 02:27:22,189
used the rec shops and until I got my

3071
02:27:20,088 --> 02:27:26,270
red card and then once I got my red card

3072
02:27:22,189 --> 02:27:28,248
then I I used it all the time you know I

3073
02:27:26,270 --> 02:27:29,899
don't I went into the wreck shop with

3074
02:27:28,248 --> 02:27:31,699
somebody who just came here recently and

3075
02:27:29,898 --> 02:27:34,338
I was looking for a certain product and

3076
02:27:31,699 --> 02:27:36,289
that's I went in there because for one

3077
02:27:34,338 --> 02:27:38,260
she had never done it before and it's an

3078
02:27:36,289 --> 02:27:41,659
experience you know everybody should go

3079
02:27:38,260 --> 02:27:43,930
yep there you go stuff is amazing I've

3080
02:27:41,658 --> 02:27:46,878
got a bottle of Apothic Anna

3081
02:27:43,930 --> 02:27:51,668
extra-strength pain cream arnica

3082
02:27:46,879 --> 02:27:53,539
peppermint juniper cannabis this stuff I

3083
02:27:51,668 --> 02:27:56,059
have said on this show that I'm

3084
02:27:53,539 --> 02:27:59,359
skeptical of topicals and lotions and

3085
02:27:56,059 --> 02:28:02,028
such 24 bucks this was actually kicked

3086
02:27:59,359 --> 02:28:02,750
down by the grimy Gatsby to me because I

3087
02:28:02,029 --> 02:28:06,620
mentioned

3088
02:28:02,750 --> 02:28:08,511
some shoulder pain I had a guest over

3089
02:28:06,620 --> 02:28:11,329
the other night who looked like hell

3090
02:28:08,511 --> 02:28:13,101
when they didn't look like they felt

3091
02:28:11,329 --> 02:28:16,069
good I was like what's up and they said

3092
02:28:13,101 --> 02:28:17,450
neck hurts and put some of this on my

3093
02:28:16,069 --> 02:28:21,671
hands and rubbed her neck for about ten

3094
02:28:17,450 --> 02:28:24,290
minutes and my hands were high my hands

3095
02:28:21,671 --> 02:28:28,060
yeah I hate to quote Pink Floyd but my

3096
02:28:24,290 --> 02:28:31,011
hands felt just like two balloons after

3097
02:28:28,060 --> 02:28:34,899
yeah I can only imagine what that girl's

3098
02:28:31,011 --> 02:28:34,899
neck felt like after I rub that I bet

3099
02:28:43,149 --> 02:28:50,060
yeah I'm sure Colorado cannabis that I

3100
02:28:47,120 --> 02:28:52,250
grew with a lightweight and it kind of

3101
02:28:50,060 --> 02:28:53,360
wrecked their world yeah that's funny

3102
02:28:52,250 --> 02:28:54,409
all right I'm gonna get a little back in

3103
02:28:53,360 --> 02:28:55,940
this article we got high and got

3104

3109
02:29:06,351 --> 02:29:11,211
know he's behind the scenes working [ __ ]

3110
02:29:08,239 --> 02:29:13,909
and you don't even know it this article

3111
02:29:11,210 --> 02:29:15,590
continues to say so how did Griego land

3112
02:29:13,909 --> 02:29:17,030
at these figures especially given the

3113
02:29:15,591 --> 02:29:18,409
state of Colorado's restrictions on

3114
02:29:17,030 --> 02:29:22,341
tracking recreational customers

3115
02:29:18,409 --> 02:29:24,261
information we keep seeing these

3116
02:29:22,341 --> 02:29:26,120
statistics and that's a question I've

3117
02:29:24,261 --> 02:29:27,409
raised twice now all right once and this

3118
02:29:26,120 --> 02:29:27,801
is the second time somebody's raised it

3119
02:29:27,409 --> 02:29:29,390
for me

3120
02:29:27,800 --> 02:29:31,310
go for it but you're you've already

3121
02:29:29,390 --> 02:29:33,171
explained it word they're not tracking

3122
02:29:31,310 --> 02:29:37,011
your name so much as they're just

3123
02:29:33,171 --> 02:29:38,690
tracking your purchase you know he

3124
02:29:37,011 --> 02:29:40,521
comments on it so he says we have a

3125
02:29:38,690 --> 02:29:42,200
media group that we hired on and they

3126
02:29:40,521 --> 02:29:44,061
monitor all of our social media and

3127
02:29:42,200 --> 02:29:45,950
Google Analytics and we've paid close

3128
02:29:44,060 --> 02:29:47,659
attention to the progression of people

3129
02:29:45,950 --> 02:29:50,540
searching on PCs and mobile devices

3130
02:29:47,659 --> 02:29:52,341
Griego said a lot of these numbers come

3131
02:29:50,540 --> 02:29:54,561
from inside the store everyone has to

3132
02:29:52,341 --> 02:29:56,239
show ID and we check IDs twice once in

3133
02:29:54,560 --> 02:29:58,431
reception and again in the dispensing

3134
02:29:56,239 --> 02:30:00,140
area plus our blood tenors are always

3135
02:29:58,431 --> 02:30:01,131
making friendly conversation asking

3136
02:30:00,140 --> 02:30:04,460
people where they're from

3137
02:30:01,130 --> 02:30:06,680
sure 80% is griego's educated guess but

3138
02:30:04,460 --> 02:30:09,649
while he knows he sees traffic locally

3139
02:30:06,681 --> 02:30:12,079
as well as from nearby weedless Colorado

3140
02:30:09,649 --> 02:30:14,728
towns Colorado Springs Wallenberg

3141
02:30:12,079 --> 02:30:16,828
Trinidad and Lahontan said he

3142
02:30:14,728 --> 02:30:22,170
says definitively that he sees more

3143
02:30:16,828 --> 02:30:23,430
Texans than anybody else our bro Kevin

3144
02:30:22,170 --> 02:30:26,039
works at a shop he's not here tonight

3145
02:30:23,430 --> 02:30:27,930
but he works at a dispensary and he says

3146
02:30:26,039 --> 02:30:29,640
it's a lot of Texans yeah

3147
02:30:27,930 --> 02:30:31,380
not surprisingly the out-of-state

3148
02:30:29,639 --> 02:30:34,920
customers are also spending more than

3149
02:30:31,379 --> 02:30:36,209
the Colorado Z said I want to know what

3150

02:30:55,738 --> 02:31:01,260
I don't go to the shops dude do you know

3162
02:30:59,639 --> 02:31:03,090
what it's heaven knows where that's I

3163
02:31:01,260 --> 02:31:10,199
just had a friend I think she said it

3164
02:31:03,090 --> 02:31:12,090
was for 60 as a caregiver my patients

3165
02:31:10,199 --> 02:31:14,158
you can find them for 350 if you shopped

3166
02:31:12,090 --> 02:31:16,619
around and it wasn't really like I want

3167
02:31:14,158 --> 02:31:18,389
this quality and this you know you can

3168
02:31:16,619 --> 02:31:21,359
still find it cheaper depending you know

3169
02:31:18,389 --> 02:31:22,349
where you want to go recreational all

3170
02:31:21,359 --> 02:31:25,170
right so I want to know if you guys are

3171
02:31:22,350 --> 02:31:27,090
paying huh on this street right now in

3172
02:31:25,170 --> 02:31:29,219
Colorado ounces depending on what you

3173
02:31:27,090 --> 02:31:31,109
want you can find an ounce for 150

3174
02:31:29,219 --> 02:31:35,488
dollars it's not the dank it's not the

3175
02:31:31,109 --> 02:31:37,828
chronic it's maybe biomedical but for

3176
02:31:35,488 --> 02:31:40,908
the fire it's about 200 blocks 225 for a

3177
02:31:37,828 --> 02:31:47,998
good dank outs right now in Colorado

3178
02:31:40,908 --> 02:31:51,328
dude if you got the hookups that top

3179
02:31:47,998 --> 02:31:52,680
shelf cush yeah if you go to the

3180
02:31:51,328 --> 02:31:57,498
dispensaries and get it it's gonna run

3181
02:31:52,680 --> 02:32:02,068
you for that same 225 200 all the routes

3182
02:31:57,498 --> 02:32:03,420
Wow all right it makes sense but and I

3183
02:32:02,068 --> 02:32:05,430
guess it's the Colorado people are

3184
02:32:03,420 --> 02:32:06,809
getting that stuff that their caregivers

3185
02:32:05,430 --> 02:32:08,670
are growing or they're buddies with the

3186
02:32:06,809 --> 02:32:11,609
caregiver dro or having some extra on or

3187
02:32:08,670 --> 02:32:12,930
something all that private cush is a

3188
02:32:11,609 --> 02:32:16,318
little bit better than the shop weed I

3189
02:32:12,930 --> 02:32:17,488
think it's it's harder for someone to

3190
02:32:16,318 --> 02:32:19,278
get on with the caregiver you know

3191
02:32:17,488 --> 02:32:22,469
especially if you don't have a medical

3192
02:32:19,279 --> 02:32:25,140
debilitating condition where you know

3193
02:32:22,469 --> 02:32:26,760
um I'm not I'm not medical because I'm

3194
02:32:25,139 --> 02:32:28,619
in a wheelchair that's for sure you know

3195
02:32:26,760 --> 02:32:30,300
or I have cancer issues knowing somebody

3196
02:32:28,620 --> 02:32:31,590
that you trust and want to assign as

3197
02:32:30,299 --> 02:32:33,119
your caregiver so here's something we

3198
02:32:31,590 --> 02:32:34,770
kind of skipped over guys we were

3199
02:32:33,120 --> 02:32:36,630
talking about caregiver and stuff when

3200
02:32:34,770 --> 02:32:38,520
you get a and now actually the word is

3201
02:32:36,629 --> 02:32:40,139
now provider in Colorado correct when

3202
02:32:38,520 --> 02:32:42,090
you're back in the day it was caregiver

3203
02:32:40,139 --> 02:32:43,260
but that was sounds confusing when you

3204
02:32:42,090 --> 02:32:44,969
get your medical marijuana

3205
02:32:43,260 --> 02:32:46,800
recommendation from a doctor there is no

3206
02:32:44,969 --> 02:32:48,238
license it's a recommendation it's not a

3207
02:32:46,799 --> 02:32:50,488
prescription they recommend that you use

3208
02:32:48,238 --> 02:32:52,889
medical cannabis they sign papers and

3209
02:32:50,488 --> 02:32:54,478
you send that paper into the Colorado

3210
02:32:52,889 --> 02:32:56,278
State registry and they send you back a

3211
02:32:54,478 --> 02:32:57,510
card that is a registry card that says

3212
02:32:56,279 --> 02:32:59,970
you are registered with state of

3213
02:32:57,510 --> 02:33:01,200
Colorado to use medical marijuana when

3214
02:32:59,969 --> 02:33:03,719
you fill out your paperwork you were

3215
02:33:01,200 --> 02:33:05,310
allowed to sign designate a person that

3216
02:33:03,719 --> 02:33:08,010
has called your provider which used to

3217
02:33:05,309 --> 02:33:09,299
be your caregiver this person the

3218
02:33:08,010 --> 02:33:10,859
paperwork says they have to be

3219
02:33:09,299 --> 02:33:15,028
responsible for something other than

3220
02:33:10,859 --> 02:33:16,470
just procuring your cannabis so you

3221
02:33:15,029 --> 02:33:17,909
should drive them to their medical

3222
02:33:16,469 --> 02:33:19,318
marijuana doctor's appointment you

3223
02:33:17,909 --> 02:33:20,879
should probably make them a kale

3224
02:33:19,318 --> 02:33:23,219
smoothie and work on their [ __ ]

3225
02:33:20,879 --> 02:33:24,898
person I said [ __ ] again somebody tweet

3226
02:33:23,219 --> 02:33:26,488
me and tell me to stop doing that I'm

3227
02:33:24,898 --> 02:33:29,608
trying I got a note in front of me still

3228
02:33:26,488 --> 02:33:31,469
watch your mouth so you make them it you

3229
02:33:29,609 --> 02:33:32,729
spend time with them you make them a

3230
02:33:31,469 --> 02:33:34,500
shake you try to do what their overall

3231
02:33:32,728 --> 02:33:36,148
well-being and if your caregiver I think

3232
02:33:34,500 --> 02:33:37,318
sitting like you and I do we hang out

3233
02:33:36,148 --> 02:33:38,398
I'm not your caregiver but when you're

3234
02:33:37,318 --> 02:33:48,148
having a bad day when something's

3235
02:33:38,398 --> 02:33:50,939
driving one of the guys is an older cat

3236
02:33:48,148 --> 02:33:52,439
his 60 year old guy and he's my bro

3237
02:33:50,939 --> 02:33:55,290
because like you come and sit on the

3238
02:33:52,439 --> 02:33:57,238
table sit at the table and we talk and

3239
02:33:55,290 --> 02:33:59,700
you feel better about that some people

3240
02:33:57,238 --> 02:34:00,988
that have AIDS cancer major [ __ ] they

3241
02:33:59,700 --> 02:34:02,159
don't have those people they need

3242
02:34:00,988 --> 02:34:03,420
someone to talk to you because a lot of

3243
02:34:02,159 --> 02:34:05,760
people are afraid of them once you're

3244
02:34:03,420 --> 02:34:08,969
sick people abandon you or you just need

3245
02:34:05,760 --> 02:34:10,529
a distance support you need extra

3246
02:34:08,969 --> 02:34:12,809
support even if those people are there

3247
02:34:10,529 --> 02:34:14,550
you can always use I'm a young energetic

3248
02:34:12,809 --> 02:34:16,019
youthful dude with a good attitude I

3249
02:34:14,549 --> 02:34:18,269
just spit right across the table at you

3250
02:34:16,020 --> 02:34:24,359
my bad I apologize for that one but I

3251
02:34:18,270 --> 02:34:26,040
didn't say [ __ ] about it I think being a

3252
02:34:24,359 --> 02:34:28,170
caregiver that's part of it going and I

3253
02:34:26,040 --> 02:34:29,760
write down spiritual counseling on my

3254
02:34:28,170 --> 02:34:31,799
when they say what else do you provide

3255
02:34:29,760 --> 02:34:33,120
as I make smoothies and shakes for these

3256
02:34:31,799 --> 02:34:34,398
guys that drive into their appointments

3257
02:34:33,120 --> 02:34:36,890
and I provide spiritual

3258
02:34:34,398 --> 02:34:38,269
just being your friend but so the

3259
02:34:36,889 --> 02:34:40,278
caregiver is a person that is

3260
02:34:38,270 --> 02:34:44,090
responsible for providing your medicine

3261
02:34:40,279 --> 02:34:47,238
the actual Colorado law does say that

3262
02:34:44,090 --> 02:34:50,059
they are allowed to charge you money to

3263
02:34:47,238 --> 02:34:52,158
cover the cost of your labor and your

3264
02:34:50,059 --> 02:34:54,318
lights and your expenses but you're not

3265
02:34:52,158 --> 02:34:56,600
supposed to profit off of caregiver

3266
02:34:54,318 --> 02:35:00,288
care get your caregiver ship your

3267
02:34:56,600 --> 02:35:01,369
provider ship so uh yeah you can so you

3268
02:35:00,289 --> 02:35:02,959
can be a caregiver in the state of

3269
02:35:01,369 --> 02:35:04,248
Colorado all you have to do is decide

3270
02:35:02,959 --> 02:35:06,050
that you want to be a caregiver and

3271
02:35:04,248 --> 02:35:09,139
learn how to grow and then find somebody

3272
02:35:06,049 --> 02:35:12,978
that trusts you enough and then work out

3273
02:35:09,139 --> 02:35:15,168
something with them the dispensaries I

3274
02:35:12,978 --> 02:35:16,639
don't think are the sinners don't give

3275
02:35:15,168 --> 02:35:19,879
you a good deal they just give you a

3276
02:35:16,639 --> 02:35:20,958
little bit of a discount my guys there

3277
02:35:19,879 --> 02:35:23,238
are people that I'm responsible for

3278
02:35:20,959 --> 02:35:25,100
right now there are four people and I

3279
02:35:23,238 --> 02:35:26,600
know pretty much exactly how much I can

3280
02:35:25,100 --> 02:35:28,760
predict when they need medicine I'll be

3281
02:35:26,600 --> 02:35:30,380
sitting around wow it's about time for a

3282
02:35:28,760 --> 02:35:31,880
patient a to give me a call tomorrow and

3283
02:35:30,379 --> 02:35:35,078
I'll put them a little package together

3284
02:35:31,879 --> 02:35:35,078
because I know what he needs and

3285
02:35:36,120 --> 02:35:41,959
[Music]

3286
02:35:37,629 --> 02:35:45,528
specific and exactly what they need you

3287
02:35:41,959 --> 02:35:48,409
know high CBD exactly I grow that Tora

3288
02:35:45,529 --> 02:35:50,180
Bora cut exactly the night nurse was

3289
02:35:48,408 --> 02:35:52,248
bred for a specific person his two

3290
02:35:50,180 --> 02:35:53,720
favorite strains are grateful dog and

3291
02:35:52,248 --> 02:35:55,850
Tora Bora and I bred them together

3292
02:35:53,719 --> 02:35:58,219
basically to make the perfect medicine

3293
02:35:55,850 --> 02:35:59,568
for one of my patients absolutely I went

3294
02:35:58,219 --> 02:36:00,738
that far for this guy plus I know it's

3295
02:35:59,568 --> 02:36:09,379
gonna be a killer string but I mean that

3296
02:36:00,738 --> 02:36:10,309
he was inspired that string on the table

3297
02:36:09,379 --> 02:36:14,599
if you want to give that thing a little

3298
02:36:10,309 --> 02:36:17,778
smell well thank you that's the night

3299
02:36:14,600 --> 02:36:19,578
nurse it's definitely frosty but DNA

3300
02:36:17,779 --> 02:36:21,560
genetics lets me use their Tora Bora

3301
02:36:19,578 --> 02:36:24,109
they gave me permission to breed with it

3302
02:36:21,559 --> 02:36:26,748
I've got their award-winning cut they

3303
02:36:24,109 --> 02:36:30,439
let me use that to breed to the grateful

3304
02:36:26,748 --> 02:36:32,539
dog and it came out pretty stinky smells

3305
02:36:30,439 --> 02:36:34,520
well I'm gonna run a bunch of tests errs

3306
02:36:32,539 --> 02:36:38,300
and maybe one day we'll put that to

3307
02:36:34,520 --> 02:36:40,039
market I definitely have

3308
02:36:38,299 --> 02:36:43,278
because I'm more of the indica smoker

3309
02:36:40,039 --> 02:36:46,050
where's your more this TV guy what's

3310
02:36:43,279 --> 02:36:47,430
weird about me I like indica flowers

3311
02:36:46,049 --> 02:36:50,728
if I'm gonna smoke a joint I wanted to

3312
02:36:47,430 --> 02:36:53,068
make me sick Wow like I just want joy

3313
02:36:50,728 --> 02:36:54,448
seems more like sitting in a hammock

3314
02:36:53,068 --> 02:36:56,129
with my feet up with the little

3315
02:36:54,449 --> 02:36:58,199
dreadlock girl cuddled up next to me and

3316
02:36:56,129 --> 02:37:01,528
some Grateful Dead on the radio and a

3317
02:36:58,199 --> 02:37:03,270
nice breeze that's smoking a joint dads

3318
02:37:01,529 --> 02:37:04,680
are like taking shots I don't drink

3319
02:37:03,270 --> 02:37:07,890
alcohol but it reminds me of when I used

3320
02:37:04,680 --> 02:37:10,109
to drink Jagermeister or tequila it's uh

3321
02:37:07,889 --> 02:37:11,879
it's more energetic it makes my head

3322
02:37:10,109 --> 02:37:13,800
spin a little bit more I don't relax

3323
02:37:11,879 --> 02:37:19,379
well after dabs it makes me want to do

3324
02:37:13,799 --> 02:37:21,269
[ __ ] yeah we won't do that tonight on

3325
02:37:19,379 --> 02:37:24,868
the show we will do a large job

3326
02:37:21,270 --> 02:37:26,908
it's almost time the large dad thing is

3327
02:37:24,869 --> 02:37:28,470
almost coming to an end I don't feel as

3328
02:37:26,908 --> 02:37:31,170
good about it as I used to I'm getting

3329
02:37:28,469 --> 02:37:33,238
older I guess your lungs have so many

3330
02:37:31,170 --> 02:37:36,029
inhales and exhales and I'm assuming by

3331
02:37:33,238 --> 02:37:39,988
doing a half I'm probably using multiple

3332
02:37:36,029 --> 02:37:41,399
inhale and exhales for each dad I'd like

3333
02:37:39,988 --> 02:37:43,170
to live a little bit longer than I

3334
02:37:41,398 --> 02:37:44,879
wanted to when I was a kid I didn't

3335
02:37:43,170 --> 02:37:47,908
realize one day I was gonna fall over

3336
02:37:44,879 --> 02:37:49,948
and die so uh we may do a grand finale

3337
02:37:47,908 --> 02:37:56,478
we may do like a Gram dab or a two gram

3338
02:37:49,949 --> 02:37:56,479
dab or something that's a long time I

3339
02:37:56,510 --> 02:38:00,930
just want to do it so that that way we

3340
02:37:58,859 --> 02:38:02,880
can retire the super large dad thing we

3341
02:38:00,930 --> 02:38:04,619
can put the dad challenges to arrest and

3342
02:38:02,879 --> 02:38:08,429
say hey we're all alive and we can do

3343
02:38:04,619 --> 02:38:10,590
the life challenge after that so we're

3344
02:38:08,430 --> 02:38:13,199
way off topic on this news thing weeds

3345
02:38:10,590 --> 02:38:15,719
expensive it could be 200 150 an ounce

3346
02:38:13,199 --> 02:38:17,550
but these shops are selling it for 500

3347
02:38:15,719 --> 02:38:20,068
now it's close enough so do you think

3348
02:38:17,549 --> 02:38:21,478
we'd ease expensive where you live even

3349
02:38:20,068 --> 02:38:24,389
though it's legal here it's not the

3350
02:38:21,478 --> 02:38:27,358
cheapest for recreational use yeah but

3351
02:38:24,389 --> 02:38:29,459
it's available yeah available between

3352
02:38:27,359 --> 02:38:30,840
the hours of 8 and 8 here's a random

3353
02:38:29,459 --> 02:38:33,568
question you're from a state where

3354
02:38:30,840 --> 02:38:35,219
cannabis was hard to get you've told me

3355
02:38:33,568 --> 02:38:37,488
stories about waiting on your deed for

3356
02:38:35,219 --> 02:38:40,948
hours and hours it was hard to get it

3357
02:38:37,488 --> 02:38:44,000
everybody is too busy there's other

3358
02:38:40,949 --> 02:38:45,210
drugs that are more important than your

3359
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:46,559
okay

3360
02:38:45,209 --> 02:38:49,799
yeah it's Florida so you guys could

3361
02:38:46,559 --> 02:38:52,709
imagine what kind of hard I grew up

3362
02:38:49,799 --> 02:38:53,640
there so I moved back so would you

3363
02:38:52,709 --> 02:38:56,459
rather have

3364
02:38:53,640 --> 02:38:58,109
whoa the internet just it's refreshing

3365
02:38:56,459 --> 02:39:00,300
multiple times and freaking me out but

3366
02:38:58,110 --> 02:39:01,591
it went right back to where it was the

3367
02:39:00,300 --> 02:39:03,079
music didn't cut out so let's go would

3368
02:39:01,591 --> 02:39:06,060

3369
02:39:03,079 --> 02:39:08,729
so street weed is cheaper a little bit

3370

3372
02:39:10,860 --> 02:39:16,560

just a parent which store would you

3378
02:39:32,101 --> 02:39:35,940

3379
02:39:34,890 --> 02:39:37,681
the store and just paying the extra

3380
02:39:35,940 --> 02:39:39,569
money or would you rather sit there and

3381
02:39:37,681 --> 02:39:41,101
wait for some high ass dude to show up

3382
02:39:39,569 --> 02:39:45,750

3387
02:39:51,120 --> 02:39:55,021

3388
02:39:53,431 --> 02:39:57,500
bit of gas because it's here at the

and I'll share it well it's different

3412
02:40:59,640 --> 02:41:03,931
here what's dry here so you need to

3413
02:41:02,310 --> 02:41:05,279
build a humid room and control your

3414
02:41:03,931 --> 02:41:06,511
humidity all right I'm just ranting yeah

3415
02:41:05,280 --> 02:41:07,720
let me get back to the article because I

3416
02:41:06,511 --> 02:41:09,430
said I had a lot of news and if this

3417
02:41:07,719 --> 02:41:12,398
we're not gonna get a lot of news and

3418
02:41:09,430 --> 02:41:14,409
news story it's it's going the way it

3419
02:41:12,398 --> 02:41:15,549
should these out-of-state consumers

3420
02:41:14,409 --> 02:41:17,170
because remember we're talking about

3421
02:41:15,549 --> 02:41:18,759
people from out of state that's how far

3422
02:41:17,170 --> 02:41:20,170
it's been these out-of-state consumers

3423
02:41:18,760 --> 02:41:21,818
are spending much more than locals

3424
02:41:20,170 --> 02:41:24,850
Griego said they're spending about twice

3425
02:41:21,818 --> 02:41:27,340
as much as locals about 120 to 140

3426
02:41:24,850 --> 02:41:28,120
dollars edibles are the most popular

3427
02:41:27,340 --> 02:41:29,978
with these people

3428
02:41:28,120 --> 02:41:31,660
out-of-state consumers can buy up to 7

3429
02:41:29,978 --> 02:41:34,299
grams of cannabis total so you see them

3430
02:41:31,659 --> 02:41:36,189
by one to two grams of Bud and the rest

3431
02:41:34,299 --> 02:41:40,028
of their allotment made up of edible

3432
02:41:36,189 --> 02:41:41,290
products I'm not sure I am NOT up to

3433
02:41:40,029 --> 02:41:43,090
date with that rule we're gonna have to

3434
02:41:41,290 --> 02:41:46,660
look that up in the future here and talk

3435
02:41:43,090 --> 02:41:51,279
about that what is your edible what

3436
02:41:46,659 --> 02:41:53,200
helmet they don't really distinguish

3437
02:41:51,279 --> 02:41:55,300
between the two I've seen your edibles

3438
02:41:53,200 --> 02:41:57,550
for this is for recreational purposes

3439
02:41:55,299 --> 02:42:03,988
devastators how much does my edible

3440
02:41:57,549 --> 02:42:06,929
count as it was gonna be weighed by the

3441
02:42:03,988 --> 02:42:08,889
metric gram or whatever you know I mean

3442
02:42:06,930 --> 02:42:10,090
remember that we're gonna have to google

3443
02:42:08,889 --> 02:42:11,409
that we'll find that out for you guys

3444
02:42:10,090 --> 02:42:13,270
remind me to check that out we'll put

3445
02:42:11,409 --> 02:42:14,829
that on a future episode of course I

3446
02:42:13,270 --> 02:42:16,029
just saw fish this weekend after your

3447
02:42:14,829 --> 02:42:19,898
while you're listening to this so I'm

3448
02:42:16,029 --> 02:42:22,000
forgetful I need some some pep talks in

3449
02:42:19,898 --> 02:42:25,180
the future remind me alright yeah we're

3450
02:42:22,000 --> 02:42:27,219

3451
02:42:25,180 --> 02:42:29,109
state boundaries with legally purchased

3452
02:42:27,219 --> 02:42:31,090
Colorado marijuana does Griego and his

3453
02:42:29,109 --> 02:42:33,040

3454
02:42:31,090 --> 02:42:35,648

3455
02:42:33,040 --> 02:42:38,170
state law and here's where I have the

3456
02:42:35,648 --> 02:42:41,978
problem this person that I got to try

3457
02:42:38,170 --> 02:42:44,079
that cream was very vocal inside the

3458
02:42:41,978 --> 02:42:46,119
store and asking where she could take

3459
02:42:44,079 --> 02:42:49,889
here said product since it was high in

3460
02:42:46,120 --> 02:42:54,010
CBD just product into you in general and

3461
02:42:49,889 --> 02:42:57,129
he after informing him after informing

3462
02:42:54,010 --> 02:43:00,280
her three times he kind of got like hey

3463
02:42:57,129 --> 02:43:02,319
can we stop saying

3464
02:43:00,280 --> 02:43:03,851
anything about taking it where you're

3465
02:43:02,319 --> 02:43:05,110
not supposed to that yeah I've already

3466
02:43:03,851 --> 02:43:07,120
said it's because when you come to go

3467
02:43:05,110 --> 02:43:08,980
Colorado Wed Adams kind of alluding to

3468
02:43:07,120 --> 02:43:11,261
is have some class be careful what you

3469
02:43:08,979 --> 02:43:13,090
say in the dispensaries no the answer is

3470
02:43:11,261 --> 02:43:15,851
no but not thinkin can I put this in my

3471
02:43:13,090 --> 02:43:17,290
car and go back to Texas no can I put

3472
02:43:15,851 --> 02:43:20,530
this in my suitcase and fly back to

3473
02:43:17,290 --> 02:43:22,721
California but what maybe maybe you're

3474
02:43:20,530 --> 02:43:27,300
not allowed to take it there's mg boxes

3475
02:43:22,720 --> 02:43:27,299
in the airport even there is ways to

3476
02:43:27,659 --> 02:43:30,579
California to fly and figure that one

3477
02:43:29,530 --> 02:43:31,630
out for yourself I'm not gonna encourage

3478
02:43:30,579 --> 02:43:33,101
you but you're not supposed to I'm gonna

3479
02:43:31,629 --> 02:43:35,109
leave all the medical states out of that

3480
02:43:33,101 --> 02:43:37,210
but no you're not supposed to leave

3481
02:43:35,110 --> 02:43:38,471
Colorado with Colorado marijuana

3482
02:43:37,209 --> 02:43:39,850
products you're really not supposed to

3483
02:43:38,470 --> 02:43:41,289
do that I shouldn't encourage it in any

3484
02:43:39,851 --> 02:43:42,521
way even if you're going to California

3485
02:43:41,290 --> 02:43:46,000
if you're going to [ __ ] Washington

3486
02:43:42,521 --> 02:43:48,011
yes and laws and procedures because I've

3487
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:50,829
seen people you know for cups bring

3488
02:43:48,011 --> 02:43:54,101
right substantial amounts just in their

3489
02:43:50,829 --> 02:43:55,989
in their backpacks you know so there is

3490
02:43:54,101 --> 02:43:57,790
forms and procedures go through that if

3491
02:43:55,989 --> 02:43:59,590
you really want to do it but you're not

3492
02:43:57,790 --> 02:44:01,601
gonna be like can I bring my quarter

3493
02:43:59,590 --> 02:44:03,521
home to Kentucky you shop at

3494
02:44:01,601 --> 02:44:05,200
dispensaries this guy says when people

3495
02:44:03,521 --> 02:44:06,670
come in we're all about safety and state

3496
02:44:05,200 --> 02:44:09,960
compliance and we make sure that the

3497
02:44:06,670 --> 02:44:12,239
out-of-state consumers are aware

3498
02:44:09,959 --> 02:44:16,099
that they're the it says then they're

3499
02:44:12,239 --> 02:44:18,719
aware that they're purchasing their okay

3500
02:44:16,100 --> 02:44:21,479
this is written weird but it says there

3501
02:44:18,719 --> 02:44:22,949
is for in-state consumption only we also

3502
02:44:21,478 --> 02:44:24,899
remind them that they can't do it in

3503
02:44:22,950 --> 02:44:25,829
public is that true - the shops remind

3504
02:44:24,899 --> 02:44:29,789
you that's no fun you're there because

3505
02:44:25,829 --> 02:44:33,149
you have an out-of-state ID a few of

3506
02:44:29,790 --> 02:44:34,680
them have not all it just really depends

3507
02:44:33,149 --> 02:44:38,129
on how busy you know if they're having a

3508
02:44:34,680 --> 02:44:40,020

3543
02:45:59,100 --> 02:46:01,970
as well from that a lot of the shops

3544
02:46:00,750 --> 02:46:04,370
here

3545
02:46:01,969 --> 02:46:05,988
80% of our customers are coming from out

3546
02:46:04,370 --> 02:46:06,800
of state so that's a good article there

3547
02:46:05,988 --> 02:46:09,228
I thought you guys would be interested

3548
02:46:06,799 --> 02:46:11,659
let's click over back to the recording

3549
02:46:09,228 --> 02:46:12,920
and see how many hours we've gone we're

3550
02:46:11,659 --> 02:46:16,250
at 30 minutes here we're gonna squeeze

3551
02:46:12,920 --> 02:46:18,139
in some more stuff you guys I sent an

3552
02:46:16,250 --> 02:46:19,728
email to Jodie Emery asking if I'm

3553
02:46:18,139 --> 02:46:22,760
allowed to play parts of a marc emery

3554
02:46:19,728 --> 02:46:25,188
video on a podcast and if i am i plan to

3555
02:46:22,760 --> 02:46:26,870
play a little bit of mark's speech that

3556
02:46:25,189 --> 02:46:28,818
he gave recently after he was released

3557
02:46:26,870 --> 02:46:32,600
from federal prison so i look forward to

3558
02:46:28,818 --> 02:46:34,189
doing that I need a drink yeah I watched

3559
02:46:32,600 --> 02:46:37,370
this and actually linked it to him it

3560
02:46:34,189 --> 02:46:43,988
was a powerful motivating speech he is

3561
02:46:37,370 --> 02:46:43,989
on the ball and if he does get you know

3562
02:46:45,459 --> 02:46:54,589
everybody should watch it you know we

3563
02:46:51,950 --> 02:47:06,800
can or we can just talk it's about you

3564
02:46:54,590 --> 02:47:08,210
know I mean let's click over here and

3565
02:47:06,799 --> 02:47:09,559
pause the music and then I think I'm

3566
02:47:08,209 --> 02:47:11,688
gonna play a little bit of this video I

3567
02:47:09,559 --> 02:47:13,519
wasn't prepared to do it but we're

3568
02:47:11,689 --> 02:47:15,559
talking about it and it seems like the

3569
02:47:13,520 --> 02:47:17,450
thing to do if you kind of play towards

3570
02:47:15,559 --> 02:47:18,859
the end of it it would kind of relay the

3571
02:47:17,450 --> 02:47:20,779
message more of it unless you want to

3572
02:47:18,859 --> 02:47:22,729
play the whole video later on how about

3573
02:47:20,779 --> 02:47:24,649
I'll play a couple of intro seconds when

3574
02:47:22,728 --> 02:47:26,090
he takes the mic he was introduced at

3575
02:47:24,648 --> 02:47:28,969
one point and he brought his friend back

3576
02:47:26,090 --> 02:47:30,829
on stage - that's good he gets

3577
02:47:28,969 --> 02:47:33,019
introduced Marc Emery is introduced by

3578
02:47:30,829 --> 02:47:34,639
somebody else mark Emery comes on stage

3579
02:47:33,020 --> 02:47:36,439
and gives thanks to another friend and

3580
02:47:34,639 --> 02:47:39,318
hands the mic to him that guy talks for

3581
02:47:36,439 --> 02:47:40,970
about eight minutes and then Marc Emery

3582
02:47:39,318 --> 02:47:43,430
comes back on stage and starts his

3583
02:47:40,969 --> 02:47:45,500
little not little his big speech will

3584
02:47:43,430 --> 02:47:47,840
start with it's about ten minutes and 25

3585
02:47:45,500 --> 02:47:49,100
seconds into the video we'll start there

3586
02:47:47,840 --> 02:47:50,510

02:48:27,700 --> 02:48:31,420
video this was kind of a weird

3609
02:48:30,159 --> 02:48:33,219
transition here that would randomly

3610
02:48:31,420 --> 02:48:35,350
happened this is marc emery right after

3611
02:48:33,219 --> 02:48:37,349
he I think he's like 48 hours out of

3612
02:48:35,350 --> 02:48:40,239
prison when he did this absolutely

3613
02:48:37,350 --> 02:48:41,920
48 something like that he said so here

3614
02:48:40,239 --> 02:48:43,090
he goes I'm gonna click playing I will

3615
02:48:41,920 --> 02:48:46,689
have to adjust the sound while it goes

3616
02:48:43,090 --> 02:48:49,180
on I apologize we'll figure it out we

3617
02:48:46,689 --> 02:48:52,148
said that while I was in prison because

3618
02:48:49,180 --> 02:48:53,680
you know doing something lets almost use

3619
02:48:52,148 --> 02:48:56,228
the word no both doing something on

3620
02:48:53,680 --> 02:48:58,329
principle late you know giving a good

3621
02:48:56,228 --> 02:49:00,849
chunk of your life in sacrifice I guess

3622
02:48:58,329 --> 02:49:03,159
for principle even in prison was highly

3623
02:49:00,850 --> 02:49:05,170
regarded you know in the four and a half

3624
02:49:03,159 --> 02:49:07,360
years I was in prison I really never

3625
02:49:05,170 --> 02:49:09,309
heard an unkind word spoken to me by any

3626
02:49:07,360 --> 02:49:11,079
inmate and I was in a medium-security

3627
02:49:09,309 --> 02:49:12,519
prison for almost all that and a lot of

3628
02:49:11,079 --> 02:49:14,469
these people are serving life

3629
02:49:12,520 --> 02:49:16,090
imprisonment without parole they've come

3630
02:49:14,469 --> 02:49:18,549
down from the penitentiary they're

3631
02:49:16,090 --> 02:49:20,889
covered in tattoos they're badass dudes

3632
02:49:18,549 --> 02:49:23,349
a lot of the Marley's they think they

3633
02:49:20,889 --> 02:49:25,799
are and and they're serving horribly

3634
02:49:23,350 --> 02:49:28,780
long sentences by and large for drugs

3635
02:49:25,799 --> 02:49:30,009
mostly methamphetamine crack cocaine but

3636
02:49:28,780 --> 02:49:32,530
certainly there were many many people

3637
02:49:30,010 --> 02:49:35,340
there for marijuana serving 10 15 and

3638
02:49:32,530 --> 02:49:39,880
even in one case 25 years for marijuana

3639
02:49:35,340 --> 02:49:42,159
distribution so I was able to be very

3640
02:49:39,879 --> 02:49:45,039
productive in jail I wrote a lot I

3641
02:49:42,159 --> 02:49:47,319
blogged I read a book every week I had

3642
02:49:45,040 --> 02:49:50,770
25 magazine subscriptions I got the New

3643
02:49:47,319 --> 02:49:52,239
York Times every day I learned how to

3644
02:49:50,770 --> 02:49:54,100
play the bass guitar was it an

3645
02:49:52,239 --> 02:49:57,069
outstanding rock and roll band of

3646
02:49:54,100 --> 02:49:58,720
incredibly talented musicians and and

3647
02:49:57,069 --> 02:50:01,260
all of them were very patient in

3648
02:49:58,719 --> 02:50:02,988
teaching me at no charge for anything

3649
02:50:01,260 --> 02:50:04,668
music

3650
02:50:02,988 --> 02:50:07,668
music principles on how to be a bass

3651
02:50:04,668 --> 02:50:09,378
guitarist and I must tell you that it

3652
02:50:07,668 --> 02:50:12,259
was a very redemptive and meaningful

3653
02:50:09,379 --> 02:50:14,270
experience being in prison and I hope I

3654
02:50:12,259 --> 02:50:16,969
always carry the message forward that I

3655
02:50:14,270 --> 02:50:19,279
saw there that you know it is a very

3656
02:50:16,969 --> 02:50:21,288
wrong society that punishes people for

3657
02:50:19,279 --> 02:50:23,209
drugs and puts them in jail for decades

3658
02:50:21,289 --> 02:50:25,310
it takes them away from their family and

3659
02:50:23,209 --> 02:50:27,529
their children and essentially ruins

3660
02:50:25,309 --> 02:50:30,318
their life because of a lifestyle choice

3661
02:50:27,529 --> 02:50:31,998
they made and we manufacture crime with

3662
02:50:30,318 --> 02:50:34,908
the drug laws we actually act as mark

3663
02:50:31,998 --> 02:50:36,408
Emery can talk for quite a while and I

3664
02:50:34,908 --> 02:50:38,088
kind of fade out Adams telling me that I

3665
02:50:36,408 --> 02:50:39,498
should play the stuff at the end of the

3666
02:50:38,088 --> 02:50:41,689
video because it's a lot more moving and

3667
02:50:39,498 --> 02:50:43,009
compelling I'm gonna save that I'm gonna

3668
02:50:41,689 --> 02:50:44,930
do a little bit I'm gonna make sure that

3669
02:50:43,009 --> 02:50:46,699
I can get permission that was about a

3670
02:50:44,930 --> 02:50:48,588
minute and a half there I hope I don't

3671
02:50:46,699 --> 02:50:50,658
get in any kind of trouble if they take

3672
02:50:48,588 --> 02:50:52,398
down this episode I apologize all it was

3673
02:50:50,658 --> 02:51:03,559
was some news in a Marc Emery rant

3674
02:50:52,398 --> 02:51:06,469
anyway what I did in jail you know I

3675
02:51:03,559 --> 02:51:09,680
mean that's moving trust me but his

3676
02:51:06,469 --> 02:51:19,219
message is definitely what you need to

3677
02:51:09,680 --> 02:51:20,869
hear we need to do the video if they let

3678
02:51:19,219 --> 02:51:22,248
me play that I'll play the last few

3679
02:51:20,869 --> 02:51:23,569
minutes at the end of this show here I'm

3680
02:51:22,248 --> 02:51:25,009
gonna wait for the email try to be

3681
02:51:23,568 --> 02:51:33,368
respectful and if I don't get the email

3682
02:51:25,009 --> 02:51:35,509
by the time I post episode in Denver

3683
02:51:33,369 --> 02:51:37,039
part of this article I'm gonna kind of

3684
02:51:35,509 --> 02:51:38,270
paraphrase it cuz it's a lot of stuff in

3685
02:51:37,039 --> 02:51:39,970
episodes getting long already I got a

3686
02:51:38,270 --> 02:51:42,649
couple more things I want to read about

3687
02:51:39,969 --> 02:51:44,658
this is from the cannabis tall so this

3688
02:51:42,648 --> 02:51:45,668
was actually published August 12th it's

3689
02:51:44,658 --> 02:51:48,498
by Aleta

3690
02:51:45,668 --> 02:51:51,639
lebec from the cannabis staff I didn't

3691
02:51:48,498 --> 02:51:56,469
say that right I'm sure but I'm sorry

3692
02:51:51,639 --> 02:52:00,139
this one is so governor Hickenlooper

3693
02:51:56,469 --> 02:52:04,849
John Hickenlooper placed these giant

3694
02:52:00,139 --> 02:52:06,288
cages around places in Denver he put one

3695
02:52:04,850 --> 02:52:08,299
in front of a skate park he put one in

3696
02:52:06,289 --> 02:52:11,239
front of a library in Denver the Denver

3697
02:52:08,299 --> 02:52:13,069
Public Library and there are big cages

3698
02:52:11,238 --> 02:52:15,049
that look like your hamster cage and

3699
02:52:13,068 --> 02:52:17,510
they call it a lab rat cage

3700
02:52:15,049 --> 02:52:20,779
it's a lab rat cage that says don't be a

3701
02:52:17,510 --> 02:52:22,760
lab rat and it's on the inside it's got

3702
02:52:20,780 --> 02:52:24,649
a little thing that tells you about

3703
02:52:22,760 --> 02:52:27,590
cannabis and the problems that cannabis

3704
02:52:24,648 --> 02:52:29,689
can cause you and it's saying don't be a

3705
02:52:27,590 --> 02:52:35,239
lab rat to cannabis to encourage kids to

3706
02:52:29,689 --> 02:52:38,479
not smoke weed well if you put a big 12

3707
02:52:35,239 --> 02:52:40,579
foot tall lab rat looking cage with the

3708
02:52:38,478 --> 02:52:42,108
giant looks like those water bottles

3709
02:52:40,579 --> 02:52:43,670
that hang upside down that your hamster

3710
02:52:42,109 --> 02:52:45,050
licks to get water and then it's got a

3711
02:52:43,670 --> 02:52:47,200
little green thing on the outside that

3712
02:52:45,049 --> 02:52:49,068
talks about cannabis on it a little note

3713
02:52:47,200 --> 02:52:50,120
if you want to come round on the side of

3714
02:52:49,068 --> 02:52:51,590
the computer bro take a look it's

3715
02:52:50,120 --> 02:52:54,470
definitely worth looking at it's funny

3716
02:52:51,590 --> 02:52:56,329
you am i right it looks just like a

3717
02:52:54,469 --> 02:52:59,209
people cage for hamsters or a hamster

3718
02:52:56,329 --> 02:53:02,148
cage for people's it is a people cage

3719
02:52:59,209 --> 02:53:02,599
and so the article says well that didn't

3720
02:53:02,148 --> 02:53:04,279
take long

3721
02:53:02,600 --> 02:53:06,020
the state of Colorado debuted 'it's

3722
02:53:04,280 --> 02:53:08,180
don't be a lab rat youth campaign on

3723
02:53:06,020 --> 02:53:10,729
Monday August 11th by dropping human

3724
02:53:08,180 --> 02:53:12,470
size laboratory cages around the Denver

3725
02:53:10,728 --> 02:53:15,219
area including outside the Denver Public

3726
02:53:12,469 --> 02:53:18,170
Library and the downtown skate park

3727
02:53:15,219 --> 02:53:18,739
vandalize vandalized signs at the skate

3728
02:53:18,170 --> 02:53:20,420
park

3729
02:53:18,739 --> 02:53:23,329
installation were reported Monday

3730
02:53:20,420 --> 02:53:24,829
evening by cbs4 the cages feature

3731
02:53:23,329 --> 02:53:26,478
posters that cite controversial

3732
02:53:24,829 --> 02:53:28,818
marijuana research studies and ask

3733
02:53:26,478 --> 02:53:31,188
open-ended questions about about pot use

3734
02:53:28,818 --> 02:53:33,709
about youth pot use sorry that was a

3735
02:53:31,189 --> 02:53:35,540
hard sentence some cleverly crossed out

3736
02:53:33,709 --> 02:53:37,398
a reference to negative effects of

3737
02:53:35,540 --> 02:53:40,220
marijuana and changed it to positive

3738
02:53:37,398 --> 02:53:42,379
although another message left on the

3739
02:53:40,219 --> 02:53:46,099
poster says critically smoking weed

3740
02:53:42,379 --> 02:53:48,049
saved my life the campaign which targets

3741
02:53:46,100 --> 02:53:50,239
teens with messages that marijuana

3742
02:53:48,049 --> 02:53:52,179
research is ongoing particularly in

3743
02:53:50,239 --> 02:53:55,129
studies of studies of the developed

3744
02:53:52,180 --> 02:53:57,979
developing brain is trying a different

3745
02:53:55,129 --> 02:53:59,599
tact from the just say no anti-drug

3746
02:53:57,978 --> 02:54:01,159
campaigns of yore

3747
02:53:59,600 --> 02:54:03,439
there are a few variations of the

3748
02:54:01,159 --> 02:54:05,389
posters that adorn the giant cages so a

3749
02:54:03,439 --> 02:54:08,148
new message is sure to replace the

3750
02:54:05,389 --> 02:54:10,099
vandalized signs the vandalism was taken

3751
02:54:08,148 --> 02:54:11,959
in stride by dr. Lurie wolf who leads

3752
02:54:10,100 --> 02:54:14,239
the state health department if they are

3753
02:54:11,959 --> 02:54:16,250
defacing it or they're doing something

3754
02:54:14,239 --> 02:54:18,109
with regard to graffiti or gathering in

3755
02:54:16,250 --> 02:54:21,079
the cages at least they're taking notice

3756
02:54:18,109 --> 02:54:22,790
and let the debate occur they're

3757
02:54:21,079 --> 02:54:25,870
probably just breaking that [ __ ] there

3758
02:54:22,790 --> 02:54:25,870
while they're smoking a joint

3759
02:54:26,280 --> 02:54:30,450
oh there was also the man who toked up

3760
02:54:29,011 --> 02:54:37,319
inside the cage at the skate park

3761
02:54:30,450 --> 02:54:40,050
according to the TV station report you

3762
02:54:37,319 --> 02:54:42,329
know it's not like there's you know

3763
02:54:40,049 --> 02:54:45,299
obviously people got off their ass and

3764
02:54:42,329 --> 02:54:47,879
sign papers that it's legal here you

3765
02:54:45,299 --> 02:54:51,029
know the two million dollar project

3766
02:54:47,879 --> 02:54:53,699
which includes a stylized website is

3767
02:54:51,030 --> 02:54:55,471
funded by a grand by a grant paid by

3768
02:54:53,700 --> 02:54:57,061
illegal sediments with settlements with

3769
02:54:55,470 --> 02:54:58,399
various pharmaceutical companies

3770
02:54:57,060 --> 02:55:00,931
according to the governor's office

3771
02:54:58,399 --> 02:55:04,289
another component of the don't be a lab

3772
02:55:00,931 --> 02:55:06,261
rat lab rat campaign are the TV ads as

3773
02:55:04,290 --> 02:55:09,271
seen below we're not gonna watch these

3774
02:55:06,261 --> 02:55:12,120
pharma get off by telling you not to be

3775
02:55:09,271 --> 02:55:14,610
a lab rat but they they need your money

3776
02:55:12,120 --> 02:55:21,120
I get that they want you on zoloft

3777
02:55:14,610 --> 02:55:22,681
instead of wheat but yep well these most

3778
02:55:21,120 --> 02:55:24,960
of our listeners probably haven't seen

3779
02:55:22,681 --> 02:55:27,000
these gigantic lab rat cages it's quite

3780
02:55:24,959 --> 02:55:28,500
entertaining they've posted there are

3781
02:55:27,000 --> 02:55:32,761
three or four stories on the cannabis

3782
02:55:28,500 --> 02:55:34,890
about it you know that's a good idea we

3783
02:55:32,761 --> 02:55:35,880
should have gone and checked it out if

3784
02:55:34,890 --> 02:55:37,470
you want to jump around on this side

3785
02:55:35,879 --> 02:55:39,060
again and take a look there's actually

3786
02:55:37,470 --> 02:55:41,189
people inside of this one as they were

3787
02:55:39,060 --> 02:55:43,470
building it they'll move the email out

3788
02:55:41,190 --> 02:55:47,101
of the way that's that's the people cage

3789
02:55:43,470 --> 02:55:50,310
they're working with right there it's

3790
02:55:47,101 --> 02:55:52,050
essentially a lion cage yeah it's why it

3791
02:55:50,310 --> 02:55:56,159
looks like a lion cage it looks like a

3792
02:55:52,049 --> 02:55:58,319
large cat small enclosure there's a 10

3793
02:55:56,159 --> 02:55:59,399
by 10 by 10 by 10 by 10 yeah but then I

3794
02:55:58,319 --> 02:56:07,590
don't even think it's that it's probably

3795
02:55:59,399 --> 02:56:10,261
12 by 10 yeah and there's a lot of

3796
02:56:07,590 --> 02:56:12,899
scrutiny about how kind of ridiculous it

3797
02:56:10,261 --> 02:56:15,090
is to from a lot of people by the looks

3798
02:56:12,899 --> 02:56:16,319
of these websites so let me click and

3799
02:56:15,090 --> 02:56:21,390
see how long we're going because I don't

3800
02:56:16,319 --> 02:56:23,340
own a jail cell I'm just gonna keep

3801
02:56:21,390 --> 02:56:25,049
moving on with that one we are about 40

3802
02:56:23,340 --> 02:56:26,521
minutes in so we can keep going we got a

3803
02:56:25,049 --> 02:56:29,220
couple we can make this a perfect hour I

3804
02:56:26,521 --> 02:56:30,620
bet if we do this right all right I'll

3805
02:56:29,220 --> 02:56:33,329
try to save a couple of minutes for the

3806
02:56:30,620 --> 02:56:36,340
marc emery part if we get a chance to do

3807
02:56:33,329 --> 02:56:38,318
so this is something random and this

3808
02:56:36,340 --> 02:56:40,478
only support I'm reading this because

3809
02:56:38,318 --> 02:56:42,278
this supports the legalization the

3810
02:56:40,478 --> 02:56:46,389
nationwide legalization and

3811
02:56:42,279 --> 02:56:47,950
decriminalization of cannabis New

3812
02:56:46,389 --> 02:56:51,549
Hampshire declares state of emergency

3813

over spice no [ __ ] right yeah how to

3814
02:56:51,549 --> 02:56:55,898
cure that let us just smoke the weed we

3815
02:56:53,228 --> 02:57:01,179
want to smoke and smoke faked spice a

3816
02:56:55,898 --> 02:57:03,849
lot of that is probation probation and

3817
02:57:01,180 --> 02:57:14,380
prohibition and job testing yeah I mean

3818
02:57:03,850 --> 02:57:16,450
I had personal experience whatever and

3819
02:57:14,379 --> 02:57:18,459
dude I will never again I was in the

3820
02:57:16,450 --> 02:57:28,329
toilet for six hours like hacking my

3821
02:57:18,459 --> 02:57:30,099
lungs up felt like a piece of [ __ ] try

3822
02:57:28,329 --> 02:57:33,309
anything twice yeah the only did spice

3823
02:57:30,100 --> 02:57:34,510
once yep alright so I'm gonna read some

3824
02:57:33,309 --> 02:57:35,769
of it doesn't even seem like we need

3825
02:57:34,510 --> 02:57:39,189

3827

3828
02:57:44,950 --> 02:57:53,800
gonna obviously legalize cannabis they

3829
02:57:49,299 --> 02:57:55,840
won't have to smoke spice employers and

3830
02:57:53,799 --> 02:57:57,579
probation probation you can't drink

3831
02:57:55,840 --> 02:58:00,398
alcohol but the employers don't care if

3832
02:57:57,579 --> 02:58:02,590
you go out at 5 o'clock or 6 o'clock or

3833
02:58:00,398 --> 02:58:04,568
if you go down to panic hour at 6:15 and

3834
02:58:02,590 --> 02:58:06,639
drink twenty two beers your employer

3835
02:58:04,568 --> 02:58:08,769
doesn't care but if you smoke a fat

3836
02:58:06,639 --> 02:58:10,539
joint man you might get fired from your

3837
02:58:08,770 --> 02:58:13,720
job which is terrible I'll read part of

3838
02:58:10,540 --> 02:58:15,189
this Governor Maggie Hassan has declared

3839
02:58:13,719 --> 02:58:16,809
a state of emergency to allow public

3840
02:58:15,189 --> 02:58:19,059
health officials to investigate and

3841
02:58:16,809 --> 02:58:20,738
quarantine synthetic drugs linked to

3842
02:58:19,059 --> 02:58:23,139
recent overdoses in Manchester and

3843
02:58:20,738 --> 02:58:26,109
Concord this is New Hampshire by the way

3844
02:58:23,139 --> 02:58:27,789
authorities say at least 41 people in

3845
02:58:26,109 --> 02:58:29,800
the Manchester area have experienced

3846
02:58:27,790 --> 02:58:32,590
serious medical reactions to synthetic

3847
02:58:29,799 --> 02:58:34,719
cannabinoids known as spice that are

3848
02:58:32,590 --> 02:58:38,020
chemically engineered substances similar

3849
02:58:34,719 --> 02:58:40,478
to the active ingredient in marijuana

3850
02:58:38,020 --> 02:58:44,829
let's scrutinize this sentence just for

3851
02:58:40,478 --> 02:58:47,608
fun cannabinoid synthetic cannabinoids I

3852
02:58:44,829 --> 02:58:51,488

3853
02:58:47,609 --> 02:58:53,439
it's poser pot known as spice that are

chemically engineered substances that's

3856
02:58:55,659 --> 02:58:59,228
close I think active ingredient in

3857
02:58:57,818 --> 02:59:01,299
marijuana marijuana doesn't have

3858
02:58:59,228 --> 02:59:03,639
ingredients it's a compound I think is

3859
02:59:01,299 --> 02:59:06,909
what you'd want to call it there so come

3860

3911

3912
03:01:25,680 --> 03:01:30,750
for in this team I was at a party the

3913
03:01:29,280 --> 03:01:33,440
other day and there were probably 11

3914
03:01:30,750 --> 03:01:36,420
medical marijuana cards in the room yeah

3915
03:01:33,440 --> 03:01:37,710
it's a huge relief said Jennifer may we

3916

have hope for children with epilepsy

3917
03:01:37,709 --> 03:01:41,100
we've been trying to find ways to help

3918
03:01:39,540 --> 03:01:43,320
the families come up with that money

3919
03:01:41,101 --> 03:01:45,750
along with the money for the oil itself

3920
03:01:43,319 --> 03:01:47,699
those who already paid the higher fee

3921
03:01:45,750 --> 03:01:49,709
will be refunded health officials said

3922
03:01:47,700 --> 03:01:51,450
Utah's law doesn't allow the district

3923
03:01:49,709 --> 03:01:52,500
distribution of medical marijuana but it

3924
03:01:51,450 --> 03:01:54,210
permits those meeting certain

3925
03:01:52,500 --> 03:01:57,090
requirements to possess the extract

3926
03:01:54,209 --> 03:01:59,549
after getting it from other states so

3927
03:01:57,090 --> 03:02:10,409
they can at least get what they need to

3928
03:01:59,549 --> 03:02:13,199
from Colorado they [ __ ] up right here

3929
03:02:10,409 --> 03:02:14,851
the extract called cannabidiol okay

3930
03:02:13,200 --> 03:02:17,720
that's good they're looking for at CBD

3931
03:02:14,851 --> 03:02:19,590
but that's not the extract

3932
03:02:17,719 --> 03:02:22,350
come on cannabis

3933
03:02:19,590 --> 03:02:23,969
please the extract called cannabidiol is

3934
03:02:22,351 --> 03:02:26,040
believed to help with severe seizures

3935
03:02:23,969 --> 03:02:27,719
particularly those experienced by

3936
03:02:26,040 --> 03:02:35,670
children with severe with a severe form

3937
03:02:27,719 --> 03:02:37,709
of epilepsy it's not an extract called

3938
03:02:35,670 --> 03:02:41,129
Kenna pity all Kenna video is a

3939
03:02:37,709 --> 03:02:43,679
cannabinoid but one of the cannabinoids

3940
03:02:41,129 --> 03:02:49,439
in the extract but I see what you're

3941
03:02:43,680 --> 03:02:51,601
doing nice article so the oil doesn't

3942
03:02:49,440 --> 03:02:53,760
have the psychoactive properties it gets

3943
03:02:51,601 --> 03:02:58,170
users high and can be mixed with foods

3944
03:02:53,760 --> 03:03:00,450
such as applesauce I wonder if they'd be

3945
03:02:58,170 --> 03:03:02,909
able to bring back the og caps because

3946
03:03:00,450 --> 03:03:04,561
those og caps from essential extracts

3947
03:03:02,909 --> 03:03:06,709
available at natural mystic cannabis

3948
03:03:04,560 --> 03:03:09,029
caregivers which is a medical shop man

3949
03:03:06,709 --> 03:03:10,289
so they're gonna have to get a Colorado

3950
03:03:09,030 --> 03:03:12,780
residency and get a medical marijuana

3951
03:03:10,290 --> 03:03:20,820
card in Colorado to even acquire this

3952
03:03:12,780 --> 03:03:22,440
type of medicine to Utah hopefully all

3953
03:03:20,819 --> 03:03:24,029
right we'll keep going the cost of

3954
03:03:22,440 --> 03:03:25,649
cannabidiol varies depending on the size

3955
03:03:24,030 --> 03:03:27,570
of the patient and the level of the dose

3956
03:03:25,649 --> 03:03:29,549
the patient is receiving for 100 pound

3957
03:03:27,569 --> 03:03:31,739
person a month's supply of a beginning

3958
03:03:29,549 --> 03:03:33,449
dose is about 40 bucks a maximum dose

3959
03:03:31,739 --> 03:03:36,090
for the same patient could cost up to

3960
03:03:33,450 --> 03:03:40,500
$900 a month what they are talking about

3961
03:03:36,090 --> 03:03:43,860
seems to be Phoenix tears Rick Simpson

3962
03:03:40,500 --> 03:03:46,170
oil full plant cannabis extract full

3963
03:03:43,860 --> 03:03:49,380

3966
03:03:51,271 --> 03:03:54,840

3967
03:03:53,521 --> 03:03:56,550
Rick Simpson oil if you guys are

3968
03:03:54,840 --> 03:03:59,040
familiar with that there's a movie

3969
03:03:56,549 --> 03:04:00,689
called run from the Cure I believe is

3970
03:03:59,040 --> 03:04:01,830
what it's called Race for the Cure rice

3971
03:04:00,690 --> 03:04:03,210
run from the Cure that Rick Simpson

3972
03:04:01,829 --> 03:04:05,219
story searches for the name Rick Simpson

3973
03:04:03,209 --> 03:04:06,389
and then put cannabis oil and you'll

3974
03:04:05,219 --> 03:04:08,279
find the movie I'm talking about learn

3975
03:04:06,389 --> 03:04:10,319
about Rick Simpson oil a lot of people

3976
03:04:08,280 --> 03:04:12,030

3977
03:04:10,319 --> 03:04:13,500

3978
03:04:12,030 --> 03:04:16,079

3979
03:04:13,500 --> 03:04:18,329
think shut out rick simpson give thanks

3980
03:04:16,079 --> 03:04:20,190
we just did a section on accident

3981
03:04:18,329 --> 03:04:21,479
the main producer of the extract in

3982
03:04:20,190 --> 03:04:23,310
Colorado has a waiting list with

3983
03:04:21,479 --> 03:04:25,560
thousands of names and doesn't expect to

3984
03:04:23,310 --> 03:04:27,601
have or supply until fall and other

3985
03:04:25,560 --> 03:04:30,029
producers of the product have also also

3986

03:05:00,750 --> 03:05:04,771

advocacy groups have warned there's no

4008
03:05:11,668 --> 03:05:16,738
proof the extract is effective at

4009
03:05:14,100 --> 03:05:18,300
treating epilepsy but family say it's

4010
03:05:16,738 --> 03:05:20,549
worth the time and cost if it brings

4011
03:05:18,299 --> 03:05:23,338
relief to those suffering from seizures

4012
03:05:20,549 --> 03:05:26,998
