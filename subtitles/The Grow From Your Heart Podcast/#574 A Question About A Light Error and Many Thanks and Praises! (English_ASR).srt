there this one may be my favorite i

146
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:35,360
thought the lemon jeffrey would be my

147
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,879
favorite i thought the orange gasm would

148
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,520
be my favorite they all battled for

149
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:39,759
favorites

150
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:42,240

guys i didn't make this message up this

219
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:42,239
came from an actual patreon subscriber

220
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,240
who bought seeds and was

221

extremely happy with their experience

222
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,960
they found seven seeds in their five

223
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:47,918
pack

224
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:49,839

225
00:06:47,918 --> 00:06:51,279
find five in yours but sometimes that

226
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:52,399
happens if i'm in a good mood and we're

227
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:53,839
packing up seeds

228
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:55,439

230
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:57,839

smokey j thank you this is a two-way

300
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,320
relationship uh if i just did podcasts

301
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:50,879
and made seeds that weren't quality and

302
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,560
nobody enjoyed it nobody appreciated it

303
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:54,080
i would probably be i think it'd be a

304
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:55,359
mental hospital if i set this gear up

305
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,639
twice a week and just did this and

306
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,159
nobody cared

307
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:59,679
that would be a sign of psycho or

308
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:00,240
psychotic or some weirdness and i would

309
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:02,879
need

310
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,799
medication and a padded room so it's a

311
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:06,480

345
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:58,639
by now and i hope you've heard the

346
00:09:57,278 --> 00:10:00,958
progression of the show

347
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:02,639
uh this show has changed evolved morphed

348
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:03,759
rotated a lot i used to do segments and

349
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:06,559
[ __ ] at the beginning

350
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:08,000
i used to type out almost everything i

351
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:09,119
was going to say throughout the entire

352
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,879
show would be written

353
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,879
and i would sit here and read a script

354
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:14,639
this is how i recommend you transplant

355
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:16,480
plants first you want to place your hand

356
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:17,120
on top of the soil and gently grip the

357
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,039
stem

358
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,879
then turn the pot upside down and shake

359
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:23,278
it gently until the pot comes out

360
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:24,399
like i was [ __ ] i was robotic it

361
00:10:23,278 --> 00:10:25,919
wasn't as much fun

362
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,240
i took a while to get comfortable doing

363
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:29,838

00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,480
there and you've been injured

636
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,079
mentally and physically uh maybe not

637
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,679
fighting for my country but for your

638
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:08,798
country and that is commendable and

639
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,720
respectable

640
00:18:08,798 --> 00:18:12,160

00:18:14,558 --> 00:18:16,480
quite honest with you they start

644

679
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:18,480
was

680
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,000
compelled to do a podcast it felt like i

681
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,720
owed the world to do it i try not to

682

bring

683
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,079
my religious or my faithful talk into

684
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,240

685
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:27,439

686
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,279

690
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:34,480

00:19:43,038 --> 00:19:45,038
jaw says

698
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,400

707
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:02,879
like spontaneously combust or melt down

708
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:04,879

723

um free of charge without this podcast i

727
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:37,119
don't know if i would have taken the

728
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,038
plunge

729
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:41,279
into growing also you've given me

730
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:43,119
passion and some purpose through growing

731
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:44,480
this hobby of growing and cannabis has

732
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:47,119
had such a profound

733
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:49,679
positive impact on getting my health and

734
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:52,079
my life back together

735
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:53,519
that makes all of the money i spent on

736
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:55,279
all this equipment right here all the

737
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:56,720
time i spent today setting up the time i

738
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:58,720
spent trying to balance this [ __ ]

739
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:01,200
light on the edge of my desk right here

740
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,480
those couple of sentences make all of

741
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,440
this effort worth it

742
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,400
there's somebody out there who soldiers

743
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,919
i hate to even

744
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,840
go down this thought but soldiers take

745
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:11,280
their own lives people who are in this

746
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:12,639
type of position if they don't have

747
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:14,240
something to live for

748
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,000
if they don't have a positive they cling

749
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,279
to the negative and they take their own

750
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,599
lives we may

751
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:20,960
i don't want to judge my friend here but

752
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:22,719
we're giving this person

753
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,558
positive light at the end of a dark dark

754
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,038
[ __ ] tunnel and that feels really

755
00:21:24,558 --> 00:21:26,558
good

756
00:21:25,038 --> 00:21:28,400
it says we've given him passion and

757
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:29,918
purpose uh that's what people need

758
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,519
without passion and purpose we get

759
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:33,520
lonely and dark and depressed

760
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:34,879
passion and purpose are what we live for

761
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:36,158
that's what keeps you inspired and

762
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,520
without passion and purpose your [ __ ]

763
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:39,760
couch potato right

764
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:41,918
uh so we've given our friend passion and

765
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:44,000
purpose through growing cannabis

766
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:45,759
the hobby of growing cannabis has had a

767
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,798
profound impact

768
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:50,879
on health and life mental physical

769
00:21:48,798 --> 00:21:52,240
spiritual uh you feel better because

770
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,039
you're spending time with your plants

771
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,079
you're in there

772
00:21:53,038 --> 00:21:55,119
when you're spending time with the

773
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:56,319
plants you got to think about them you

774
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:56,959
have to pay attention to them so you

775
00:21:56,319 --> 00:21:58,798
can't

776
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,400
think about the post-traumatic stress

777
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:01,279
that's in the mind you've got to focus

778
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,480
on the plants

779
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:04,639
so you're thinking about the plants

780
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,558
you're getting away from the ptsd

781
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,720
then you've got an outcome that you can

782
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:10,798
be proud of you're proud of that

783
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,000
then you get to smoke that outcome now

784
00:22:10,798 --> 00:22:14,400
you're stoned

785
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,759
and now the ptsd the problems that's all

786
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,640
gone and guess what we get to wake up

787
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:18,640
tomorrow

788
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,480
and go back in the garden and do it all

789
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,960
over again now since we're feeling

790
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,960
better

791
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,240
spending time away from our own thoughts

792
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,200
spending time in the garden we start

793
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,720
feeling better

794
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,480
consuming a product that makes us feel

795
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,600
better getting a better attitude

796
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,839
now maybe we can have better

797
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:33,359
relationships with people simple things

798
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:35,439
like that will compound

799
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:36,399
maybe maybe after a few months you'll

800
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,159
develop a really

801
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,120
maybe that guy at the store that you

802
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:40,000
just keep your hat down because you

803
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:41,199
don't want to deal with the [ __ ]

804
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,720
cashier at the store

805
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,319
maybe you'll say hey thank you have a

806
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,600
good day and they'll go damn that guy

807
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:47,200
just told me to have a good day

808
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:49,038
nobody's told me to have a good day all

809
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,080
day and instead of yelling at their wife

810
00:22:49,038 --> 00:22:52,400
when they get home they'll go

811
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:53,359
hey honey i brought you a snickers bar

812
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,200

814
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,679
that's how small ripples [ __ ] happen

815
00:22:57,759 --> 00:23:00,960
let's get [ __ ] focused here uh

816
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:02,320

817
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,640

820
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:08,240
it says the next thing to tell you is

821
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,240
that i have provided that you have

822
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,359
provided a positive impact both on my

823
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,159
mental health and

824
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:14,879
my garden there are days where a hole of

825
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,720
depression

826
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,080
has sucked me so far down that i don't

827
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,880
even have the willpower

828
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:22,639

pretty cool messages

it's gonna go on there is more it says

881
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:55,759
there are people who go through life not

882
00:24:55,278 --> 00:24:57,359
knowing

883
00:24:55,759 --> 00:24:59,519
that they have truly impacted someone's

884
00:24:57,359 --> 00:25:00,000
life and also potentially push them onto

885
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:02,720
a different

886
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,278
path cannabis and you have potentially

887
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,960
given me

888
00:25:03,278 --> 00:25:07,278
that push and have helped me during my

889
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,400
long road of rehab over the last couple

890
00:25:07,278 --> 00:25:10,558
of years

891
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,240

00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,720
help with my previous question

975
00:27:32,798 --> 00:27:36,398
i had a hermaphrodite and it was likely

976
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:39,519
caused by an extension cord

977
00:27:36,398 --> 00:27:41,759
that has an orange light up tip

978
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:42,960
ah that's possible that's possible if

979
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:45,200
that much

980
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:47,038
light caused that plant to hurt i would

981
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:49,278
just get rid of those genetics

982
00:27:47,038 --> 00:27:50,558
that's too uh that's too finicky anyway

983
00:27:49,278 --> 00:27:51,919
and i know what you mean sometimes those

984
00:27:50,558 --> 00:27:53,200
extension cords have the orange light up

985
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:54,080
tips you can find it in the dark and you

986
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,600
know where to plug in

987
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:57,119
i know what you mean but i would i'd

988
00:27:55,599 --> 00:27:59,038
still reconsider

989
00:27:57,119 --> 00:28:01,278
anyway it says i sprayed the room down

990
00:27:59,038 --> 00:28:01,839
and my next crop is looking beautiful

991
00:28:01,278 --> 00:28:04,880

992
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:05,678

995
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:10,240
don't have that problem again

996
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,519
hopefully you've gotten rid of that

997
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,519
extension cord hopefully you checked

998
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:15,038
that there were no light leaks

999
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:16,960
let's stay focused there is a brand new

1000
00:28:15,038 --> 00:28:18,079
question it says i do have another

1001
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,640
question for you

1002
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:21,278
i accidentally left my uv supplement

1003
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,679
light on

1004
00:28:21,278 --> 00:28:25,519
overnight how long does it typically

1005
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:26,320
take for plants to show hermaphroditic

1006
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:29,119
traits

1007
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:30,000
uh will one day of uv being on for 16

1008
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:32,239
hours while all

1009
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,519
of the other lights off caused this

1010
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,359
plant to herm

1011
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:37,038
i'm sure you can't say 100 as there are

1012
00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:37,359
many other factors that can be at play

1013
00:28:37,038 --> 00:28:40,798
but

1014
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:42,558
any of your advice is greatly

1015
00:28:40,798 --> 00:28:45,839
appreciated let me write down a note

1016
00:28:42,558 --> 00:28:45,839
that i forgot to write

1017
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:50,798
oh okay there we go notes on the fly um

1018
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,120
so

1019
00:28:50,798 --> 00:28:55,200
our friend riley here has left his uv

1020
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:55,918
light on for 16 hours that means it was

1021
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,919
on

1022
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:59,679
your plants if you're in flower let's

1023
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:01,679
see if you're if you're in veg this is

1024
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:04,399
not a problem if you're in flower

1025
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:06,240
um i'm not sure why it was on for 16

1026
00:29:04,398 --> 00:29:07,119
extra hours you got a 12 12 cycle it

1027
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,720
should have gone off

1028
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:10,479
anyway the light stayed on that's the

1029
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,679
bottom line here we had a uv light stay

1030
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,720
on

1031
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:17,360
honestly i am not educated

1032
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,558
in uv lighting when it comes to cannabis

1033
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:20,639
growing cultivation

1034
00:29:18,558 --> 00:29:22,240
cannabis production commercial growing

1035
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,720
feeding plants loving plants knowing

1036
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,519
plants

1037
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:27,600
i will say that lighting is my weakest

1038
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:29,278
part of that whole subject

1039
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:30,558
i know the plants very well i can look

1040
00:29:29,278 --> 00:29:30,960
at plants and tell you what's wrong with

1041
00:29:30,558 --> 00:29:33,678
them

1042
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,240
i can breed plants i can fix grow rooms

1043
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:37,038
i am

1044
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:38,798
a little bit uneducated as not as

1045
00:29:37,038 --> 00:29:40,240
educated as i should be

1046
00:29:38,798 --> 00:29:42,558
when it comes to grow lights and grow

1047
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,440
light technology all those graphs and

1048
00:29:42,558 --> 00:29:45,359
things my brain

1049
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,960
honestly my brain just isn't interested

1050
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:48,479
i want to learn about it my brain goes

1051
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,319
nah let's go look at microbes or

1052
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,480
something so i go read about microbes

1053
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:53,439
that's i could do that i probably

1054
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,880
shouldn't but

1055
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,558
that's what my brain chooses to do and

1056
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,000
then we let guys like keith from

1057
00:29:56,558 --> 00:29:59,599
blacksail big shout out to keith from

1058
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,119
blacksail let's get you on the show bro

1059
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:01,759
come talk on my show about the mccree

1060
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:03,599
curve

1061
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:04,960
and teach me about lighting and help me

1062
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:06,639
understand lighting a little bit better

1063
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,159
that's my official invite to you keith

1064
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,679
i'll reach out via text here this week

1065
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:11,120
and try to get you on the show

1066
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:13,038
but honestly i'm not educated in

1067
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:14,719
lighting so i don't know enough about

1068
00:30:13,038 --> 00:30:16,079
specifically uvs to talk

1069
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,480
i'm going to talk about plants in

1070
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:18,480
general

1071
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:24,240
uh this is going to be very very plant

1072
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,720
specific very cultivar specific i don't

1073
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,558
know

1074
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,240
what plant you're working with you may

1075
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:30,480
have multiple plants in the room

1076
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,679
some will react differently than others

1077
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,519
to this

1078
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:35,038
light era this is basically the same as

1079
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:36,558
a light leak you had light interruptions

1080
00:30:35,038 --> 00:30:38,879
during your dark period

1081
00:30:36,558 --> 00:30:40,480
this could cause problems so it's going

1082
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:43,840
to be very plant specific

1083
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:46,159
i would watch four problems uh watch and

1084
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:46,398
see if you see male flowers popping up

1085
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:48,240
on

1086
00:30:46,398 --> 00:30:50,000
any branches of your plants look on the

1087
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,919
top branches look on the lower

1088
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,519
branches don't just look at the tops and

1089
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:54,720
think you're okay look down in the lower

1090
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:55,679
part of the plant where you don't get a

1091
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,720
lot of light

1092
00:30:55,679 --> 00:31:01,120
look and see if you've got male flowers

1093
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:03,038
popping up out of those buds anywhere on

1094
00:31:01,119 --> 00:31:04,798
that plant look very carefully on all

1095
00:31:03,038 --> 00:31:06,879
the plants that are in there

1096
00:31:04,798 --> 00:31:08,398
watch for intersex traits watch for male

1097
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:11,278
flowers

1098
00:31:08,398 --> 00:31:12,879
um check now and then also keep checking

1099
00:31:11,278 --> 00:31:14,640
throughout the entire grow cycle they

1100
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,559
may take a little bit to pop up that is

1101
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:19,600
one of your major parts of this question

1102
00:31:16,558 --> 00:31:21,678
how long until they pop up you may never

1103
00:31:19,599 --> 00:31:24,158
see male flowers you may never see

1104
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:27,600
pollen sacks you may never see anthers

1105
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:29,278
but you may get seeds at the end so

1106
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:30,879
it is hard to guess you may not know

1107
00:31:29,278 --> 00:31:32,159
exactly what happened until you harvest

1108
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,640
and cut them down and see what you've

1109
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:34,159
got

1110
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,440
you're gonna have to chop it down and

1111
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:36,399
when you're trimming it you'll know if

1112
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,080
there are seeds in there

1113
00:31:36,398 --> 00:31:40,158
you'll start seeing buds with the

1114
00:31:38,079 --> 00:31:41,839
calyxes are just extra swollen there's a

1115
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:42,320
seed inside of there drop those seeds

1116
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:46,319
out

1117
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:48,000
see what you've got um then

1118
00:31:46,319 --> 00:31:49,839
uh watch for seeds if you've got seeds

1119
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,519
in there i would say grow some of the

1120
00:31:49,839 --> 00:31:53,599
seeds that's gonna be fun you may

1121
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:55,519
have just accidentally made a bunch of

1122
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:58,480
seeds for yourself to play with

1123
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:59,120
um don't sell the seeds if you did make

1124
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,798
seeds

1125
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:03,359
don't be that guy that decides to sell

1126
00:32:00,798 --> 00:32:04,879
them do not sell these seeds these are

1127
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:06,558
accidental seeds they're not made for

1128
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,399
the market they're made for you

1129
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:09,759
possibly some of your grow friends if

1130
00:32:08,398 --> 00:32:10,319
you've got some friends that need some

1131
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:12,798
seeds

1132
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:14,000
you can donate these seeds to them if

1133
00:32:12,798 --> 00:32:16,558
they come with a solid

1134
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,079
disclaimer hey these were accidental

1135
00:32:16,558 --> 00:32:19,119
light leak seeds i don't know if these

1136
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:20,558
are going to be

1137
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:21,759
hermaphrodites if they're going to be

1138
00:32:20,558 --> 00:32:22,158
feminized seeds or if they're going to

1139
00:32:21,759 --> 00:32:24,158
be

1140
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:25,600
wild mutants they could be anything

1141
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:27,440
they've got a lot of potential

1142
00:32:25,599 --> 00:32:29,918
to be problematic they've also got a lot

1143
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:32,880
of potential to be real [ __ ] hitters

1144
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:33,360
um i wrote down gorilla glue number four

1145
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,080
was an

1146
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:37,519
accidental pollination that made a

1147
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:39,199
champion of course that was a male

1148
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:39,919
female cross to the best of my knowledge

1149
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,038
but it was an

1150
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:44,320
accident golden goat was an accident

1151
00:32:43,038 --> 00:32:46,480
of course that was a male female

1152
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:48,558
pollination again an accident

1153
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,079
girl scout cookies there's a lot of

1154
00:32:48,558 --> 00:32:51,759
controversy around the girl scout

1155
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:53,359
cookies line i think girl scout cookies

1156
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:54,640
was bag seed i don't think anybody

1157
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:56,479
really knows what happened

1158
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,000
but if it was bag seed that's the same

1159
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,278
as what you've got see they came from

1160
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,640
buds and we don't know where it came

1161
00:32:59,278 --> 00:33:02,558
from and it grew out to be

1162
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:04,000
the biggest [ __ ] trend in cannabis

1163
00:33:02,558 --> 00:33:05,839
for several years

1164
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,919
a lot of the controversy in cannabis is

1165
00:33:05,839 --> 00:33:09,359
around that strain still is i don't even

1166
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:11,679
know what the real cross of it is

1167
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:12,959
so there you go cookies got real popular

1168
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:16,320
and it was bag seed

1169
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:18,880
now let's talk about the entire chem dog

1170
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:20,558
family was bag seed so that was some of

1171
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:25,440
the most amazing herb ever found

1172
00:33:20,558 --> 00:33:27,119
chem 91 kim four kim d kim's sister

1173
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,558
excuse me all the subsequent chem

1174
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:31,678
crosses that came from there

1175
00:33:28,558 --> 00:33:32,720
all of those chem crosses came from one

1176
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:34,640
bag of weed

1177
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,640
if you don't know what the story of chem

1178
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:38,000
dog and the legend of the 13 beans that

1179
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:40,080
is something that you should research

1180
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,519
if you consider yourself a cannabis

1181
00:33:40,079 --> 00:33:43,038
historian or someone that's really

1182
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,839
interested in cannabis if you're a weed

1183
00:33:43,038 --> 00:33:46,558
nerd

1184
00:33:43,839 --> 00:33:48,798
chem dog and the legend of the 13 beans

1185
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:49,200
kem bought some weed there were 13 seeds

1186
00:33:48,798 --> 00:33:50,558
in there

1187
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,798
he grew a few of them that's where the

1188
00:33:50,558 --> 00:33:53,678
chem dog lineage came from that was bag

1189
00:33:52,798 --> 00:33:55,599
seed

1190
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:56,720
if there are seeds in your bud they are

1191
00:33:55,599 --> 00:33:58,240
bag seed

1192
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:00,720
like i said a moment ago they've got the

1193
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,480
potential to be the next chem 91 the

1194
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,319
next gorilla glue number four

1195
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:06,000
or they can also be the next thing that

1196
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:07,918
[ __ ] up your garden and wreak havoc

1197
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,519
in your grow room so if you did make

1198
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:10,639
those seeds grow them yourself and see

1199
00:34:09,519 --> 00:34:12,000
what you've got

1200
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:13,440
maybe you've got some fun in there maybe

1201
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,878
you've got some problems it's always fun

1202
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:17,838
to grow seeds that you made

1203
00:34:14,878 --> 00:34:18,480
even if it was an accident so i know you

1204
00:34:17,838 --> 00:34:21,199
want to know

1205
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:24,320
how long until you're gonna see herm uh

1206
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:26,398
seven to ten days probably maybe 14 days

1207
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:28,240
maybe a little bit later it all depends

1208
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:29,679
on how those plants react i'm not sure

1209
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:31,279
what cuts you've got in there i'm not

1210
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:33,358
sure how sensitive they are to light i'm

1211
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:35,200
not sure what their critical periods are

1212
00:34:33,358 --> 00:34:36,639
i'm not sure excuse me i'm not sure who

1213
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:38,239
bred them i don't know what's up with

1214
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:40,878
those plants so i don't want to give you

1215
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:42,719
any false hope but look out for seeds

1216
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:43,519
look out for problems and just pay close

1217
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:44,559
attention

1218
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:46,639
i'm going to take a drink and then i've

1219
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:49,838
got one more thing to ramble about

1220
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:49,838
on this message

1221
00:34:55,358 --> 00:34:59,759
if they are seated they are not a total

1222
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,280
loss first you've got a bunch of seeds

1223
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,720
to play with as a breeder that's fun

1224
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,240
even if they're not

1225
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:05,519
available for a market or something you

1226
00:35:04,239 --> 00:35:07,039
want to sell grow them see what you've

1227
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:08,639
got run ten of them

1228
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:10,239
run them in beer cups put them in a beer

1229
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:11,759
cup veg them out until they're

1230
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:13,358
three and three quarters inches tall the

1231
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,280
size of a gi joe and then put them into

1232
00:35:13,358 --> 00:35:16,719
flour and see what you get

1233
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,800
they could be [ __ ] awesome they could

1234
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:20,078
be total [ __ ] but if they're in a beer

1235
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,599
cup they're only 10 of them you're only

1236
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:22,960
wasting so much space

1237
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:25,039
find out what you've got they could be

1238
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:28,400
really [ __ ] cool now if they are

1239
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:30,000
seated you can still uh i wouldn't want

1240
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,440
to really smoke the flour if it's seeded

1241
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,960
you can but you got to clean the [ __ ]

1242
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,159
seeds out of the flour before you smoke

1243
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,519
it that's a pain in the ass that's like

1244
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:36,399
old school back in the day we don't need

1245
00:35:35,519 --> 00:35:39,440
to do that

1246
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:41,358
but you can process and use seeded herbs

1247
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,159
you can extract it you can make edibles

1248
00:35:41,358 --> 00:35:44,719
out of it

1249
00:35:42,159 --> 00:35:46,000
uh you can make bubble hash out of it if

1250
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:47,358
you find out there's seeds in there

1251
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,440
running through the bubble bags

1252
00:35:47,358 --> 00:35:50,719
you're just gonna separate the seeds and

1253
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,838
everything just like you normally would

1254
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:53,598
the seeds are gonna be right there in

1255
00:35:51,838 --> 00:35:54,559
the mix you can still make bubble out of

1256
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:56,640
it

1257
00:35:54,559 --> 00:35:58,639
you can also still make bho if you're

1258
00:35:56,639 --> 00:36:00,639
one of those guys that is still running

1259
00:35:58,639 --> 00:36:03,838
bho you can absolutely make

1260
00:36:00,639 --> 00:36:05,039
bho out of seeded products so you can

1261
00:36:03,838 --> 00:36:07,199
make bho

1262
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:08,960
uh grind it up pull the seeds out or

1263
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:10,719
just pack the [ __ ] seeded buds into

1264
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,240
the tube and extract it just like that

1265
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:14,159
or if you're making diamonds and sauce

1266
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:16,000
do your method with the seeded product

1267
00:36:14,159 --> 00:36:17,279
just get the seeds out or don't that is

1268
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,440
up to you

1269
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:21,040
one thing i'd recommend though do not

1270
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,039
press it if there's seeds in there

1271
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:25,119
that's probably obvious to most people

1272
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:26,239
but to some people i am not certain that

1273
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:28,960
that's obvious

1274
00:36:26,239 --> 00:36:30,639
let's not go pressing uh the seated butt

1275
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,000
it'll blow up like popcorn

1276
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:34,078
it'll be like when you used to smoke a

1277
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,639
seed in the joint you don't want to do

1278
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:37,680
that

1279
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:39,199
so it is not a total loss even if it is

1280
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:41,279
seeded sorry i'm making myself a edit

1281
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:42,000
note uh it is not a total loss even if

1282
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:45,119
it is

1283
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,960
seeded uh you can still make bubble hash

1284
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:48,240
you can make bho you can make butters

1285
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,679
you could probably make salves and

1286
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:50,959
topicals and whatever else you want to

1287
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:52,559
do with it

1288
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:54,480
but don't press it because you don't

1289
00:36:52,559 --> 00:36:57,440
want blowing up seeds like a

1290
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:59,280
popcorn bowl so i wish i could give you

1291
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,960
better advice i wish i could tell you

1292
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,480
exactly when they're going to herm if

1293
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,760
they are going to her but i don't know

1294
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:05,679
that that's going to happen

1295
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:07,520
my best advice is keep an eye on each

1296
00:37:05,679 --> 00:37:09,519
and every single plant

1297
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:11,280
look at every plant every day pay

1298
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:12,000
attention look at the top look in the

1299
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,920
middle

1300
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,039
absolutely look at the bottom when

1301
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,039
you're doing work in there

1302
00:37:15,039 --> 00:37:19,838
just look around at the plants do what i

1303
00:37:17,039 --> 00:37:21,838
call the growers gaze just stare at them

1304
00:37:19,838 --> 00:37:23,519
just slowly look across the room and

1305
00:37:21,838 --> 00:37:24,480
you'll go oh [ __ ] there it is and you'll

1306
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:26,159
see that intersex

1307
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,599
trait popping up on one of your plants

1308
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:28,960
that's how you're going to find it

1309
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:30,559
if you do find it i'm hoping you don't

1310
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,679
to tell you the truth all right riley

1311
00:37:30,559 --> 00:37:32,960
i've been rambling for quite a few

1312
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:34,399
minutes on your message i'm going to

1313
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,440

1314
