6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,439

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,840
talking about what i'm smoking

8
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:27,118
today i've been taking dabs of cake face

9
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:29,518
batter from binsk

10
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:31,039
in my opinion this tastes like diesel

11
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:32,399
fuel and cake batter

12
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,320
maybe if you went and got some diesel

13
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,280
fuel in the truck drove home whipped up

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,799
a little cake batter

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,039
and then smelled your fingers it would

16
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:40,479
taste like a sweet diesel-fuelly cake

17
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,479
batter and i find it

18
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:43,878
delightful on the back of the package it

19
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:47,038
says it contains

20
00:00:43,878 --> 00:00:48,320

91
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:50,799
typos and small errors in the podcast in

92
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:52,238

93
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,959
big mistakes but a couple of

94
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:57,120
just numbers uh one time it was 87 and i

95
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,280

to edit

103
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,400
uh maybe one last dab between finishing

104
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,439

229
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,000
i think i am

230
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,439
trying not to wear graphic tees as much

231
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,120
not my own brand

232
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:43,038
i don't want to wear my brand i may wear

233
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,319
your brand but it's almost i've grown

234
00:06:43,038 --> 00:06:45,680
out of wearing my brand it feels a

235
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,520
little bit silly sometimes

236
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,800
when they go rasta jeff of irie genetics

237

239
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,960
not a comic book hero

240
00:06:51,598 --> 00:06:54,879
i don't need to have my own logo on my

241
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:57,038
chest all the time but sometimes it's

242
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:58,560
acceptable i guess anyway i'm rambling

243
00:06:57,038 --> 00:06:59,918

249
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:09,918
podcast it is my job to keep this thing

250
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:11,120
on the rails

251
00:07:09,918 --> 00:07:13,758
here we go this is what we're going to

252
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,120
talk about now recently the power went

253
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,919
out where i grow

254
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,879
i wasn't here or i wasn't there and i

255
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:20,318
showed up at the grow

256
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:22,240
the whole neighborhood was dark i was

257
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,400
like something's going on pulled up

258
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,840
it was dark none of the normal sounds

259
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:27,679
you hear in the grow were happening

260
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:29,279
i went to where the grow is the clone

261
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,639
machine was not bubbling that was my

262
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:32,879
number one concern

263
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:35,840
i've got an easy cloner going usually i

264
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:37,360
hear that constant

265
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:39,359
it just never stops there's always the

266
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,199
sound of that just a whirring watering

267
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,000
thing happening it's always going

268
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,439
i did not hear that so i went into a

269
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,038
light panic mode i wouldn't say a major

270
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:48,879
panic mode i did go into a light panic

271
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:51,519
and i said [ __ ] the cloner's not working

272
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:53,199
i wonder how long that's been going um i

273
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:54,399
noticed all the lights were out the air

274
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,319
conditioner was out

275
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:58,318
the fans were not blowing everything was

276
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,000
shut down the cloner was my major

277
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,000
concern like i've said but

278
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,839
this made me think maybe i should tell

279
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,560
our friends what we could do

280
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:08,560
in the situation of a power outage the

281
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:12,240
number one thing i thought of

282
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:14,160
is to remind you to buy digital timers

283
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,519
when you're buying timers for your grow

284
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,439
you've got the opportunity to buy

285
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:18,719
digital timers with the battery backup

286
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:20,399
or you can buy those

287
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,240
shitty timers with the little pegs that

288
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:23,598
you push down and then they turn you

289
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,360
plug them in and they turn and

290
00:08:23,598 --> 00:08:26,800
as time goes by those pegs are either up

291
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,680
or down and those pegs tell it to be off

292
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,960
or on

293
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,759
those are fine but when the power goes

294
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:34,240
out

295
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,360
those timers stop spinning so those

296
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,200
little pegs

297
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,560
nothing happens while the time time is

298
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,278
out while the power is out nothing

299
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,278
happens

300
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:43,360
that timer quits turning so when the

301
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:43,838
power comes back on it resumes where it

302
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,039
is

303
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,720
so if you're in the middle of your

304
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:48,240
flowering cycle the timer goes off

305
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,800
you're six hours into flower

306
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,080
and your flowering day power goes off

307
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:53,519
power comes on

308
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,440
anytime later we're going to say three

309
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,200
hours later now your timer is going to

310
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,040
kick back on and it's going to continue

311
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,839
the six hour day cycle that you've got

312
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:02,159
programmed

313
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:04,000
because time stood still on your timer

314
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:05,360
while time kept moving in the real world

315
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,440
on the babylon clock

316
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,120
time kept moving on the sun clock time

317
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,320
kept moving on your little broken timer

318
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,480
with the power outage

319
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,720
time stayed still so when the time comes

320
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,159
back on all of your cycles all of your

321
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,920
routines all of your rhythms are now

322
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:18,639
[ __ ] nothing is the way you expected

323
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:20,159
it to be

324
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:22,000
you've got to go back and manually

325
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:24,879
readjust the time on that timer

326
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
or it's going to be off until you fix it

327
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:27,919
and sometimes

328
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,278
the power goes off and you're not at the

329
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:30,639
place where the power goes off maybe i

330
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:32,639
didn't show up at that grow

331
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:34,319
in time and the power came back on and

332
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:35,519
it had been off for four hours i never

333
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,000
would have known that timer would have

334
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,159
adjusted

335
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,360
itself four hours so my grow would have

336
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:41,120
been off everything would have been

337
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,720
mistimed by four hours

338
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,480
and that could that could destroy

339
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,278
everything so buy

340
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,959
the digital timer with a battery backup

341
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:50,720
that way when the power goes out

342
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:52,479
if the power were to go out here and i

343
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,080
had that timer plugged in behind me

344
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,080
it would keep ticking it would follow

345
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,519
the normal babylon clock it would follow

346
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,720
the rest it would follow my cell phone

347
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,679
because my phone doesn't die when the

348
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,519
power goes out

349
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:02,958
that clock keeps going so would my

350
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,639
battery back up clock

351
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:06,559
that way when the power does come back

352
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:07,120
on it can it'll stay on the same

353
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:08,639
schedule

354
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,399
when the power goes off it does not

355
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:11,519
continue to run my light with the backup

356
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,879
battery don't think that's what the

357
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,799
backup battery is for

358
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:16,000
that backup battery is to keep the time

359
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:18,159
at the same time

360
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,078
then when the power comes back on it is

361
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:21,759
still whatever time it is on your phone

362
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:22,399
on the babylon clock it's that time

363
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:24,720
still

364
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,759
on your timer all of your cycles are set

365
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,278
where they should be

366
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:29,519
you shouldn't miss a beat other than

367
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:30,958
that time that it was off so i hope i

368
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,879
made that point clearly because that was

369
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:34,159
a lot of [ __ ] rambling uh once again

370
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:36,559
shout out to the dabs

371
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:37,679
buy digital timers if you have got the

372
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:39,278
opportunity

373
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:41,199
digital timers are much better than the

374
00:10:39,278 --> 00:10:43,120
analog timers that stick

375
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,800
and don't keep flowing when the time

376
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,399
cuts out when the power cuts out

377
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:48,000
time stops on those so get yourself a

378
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,159
digital timer and stay

379
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,919
correct on your time now where do we go

380
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:53,360
from there i keep mentioning that easy

381
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:54,559
cloner that was the thing that made me

382
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,240
panic the most

383
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:58,000
i ran and i checked the ez cloner i

384
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,440
lifted it up and i touched the roots of

385
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,159
the plants they were barely starting to

386
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,320
root

387
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:04,078
they were wet they were moist they were

388
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,000
not dripping with water like i would

389
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:07,278
like them to be but they had moisture to

390
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
them which means they were going to

391
00:11:07,278 --> 00:11:09,360
survive

392
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,120
so that power couldn't have been out for

393
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,879
very long so

394
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,039
what i do with my power cleaner with my

395
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:16,399
ez cloner turbo cloner power cloner all

396
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:17,759
of those electric cloners that spray

397
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,839
water from the bottom

398
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:22,480
if your power does go out my advice to

399
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:24,079
you is about every 30 minutes to an hour

400
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,959
lift that lid up and just use a spray

401
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:28,479
bottle and spray those roots spray those

402
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:30,479
where they would normally get misted

403
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,079
spray them just manually go in there

404
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,720
with a spray bottle and spray the [ __ ]

405
00:11:32,078 --> 00:11:34,239
out of them

406
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,160
if you need to scoop up some of the

407
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,759
water that is in the cloner and use that

408
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:38,480
water as your spray just go ahead and

409
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:40,399
spray them

410
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,000
that way the roots stay nice and wet or

411
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,519
the root zone where the roots are going

412
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,039
to happen stay nice and wet and you

413
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:47,360
don't kill off your clones

414
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:49,439
spray them every 30 45 minutes just keep

415
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,959
them wet maybe once every hour and they

416
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,000
will survive so that is a way to keep

417
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:54,399
the easy cloner

418
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,759
the turbo cloners alive now if you are

419
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,839
missing light hours

420
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:59,759
that's okay the power went off while i

421
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:02,399
was gone that is okay

422
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:04,480
you cannot have power the lights come on

423
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,000
during the dark cycle that is a problem

424
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,839
having the lights go off during the

425
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,600
darks during the day cycle

426
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,360
if the lights go off during the day

427
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,440
cycle all you're really losing

428
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,120
is that photosynthetic energy you're not

429
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,959
getting the photons the energy

430
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,399
the light energy from the from the light

431
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:20,000
that day so your plants are going to

432
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:22,159
lack that little bit

433
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,519
but it's not as detrimental as if you

434
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:25,519
were getting interruptions

435
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,959
in the dark period so you can miss a few

436
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,600
hours um

437
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:31,679
one thing i did notice quickly very

438
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,959
quickly the temperature and humidity of

439
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:34,879
my grow spaces

440
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:36,799
went out of control it was really humid

441
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:37,679
in there it was really stagnant it was

442
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:39,199
quite funky

443
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:40,799
the temperature was moving around i

444
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,480
could feel the humidity in there

445
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:44,240
however i couldn't tell you what the

446
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,600
temperature or humidity are because the

447
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,440
devices i use

448
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,040
are attached to a plug-in device and

449
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,639
when the power went out

450
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:52,240
they were no longer powered i didn't

451
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,759
know what was happening in that room for

452
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,320
that period of time when the power came

453
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:56,078
back on

454
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,920
all my monitors came back on but my

455
00:12:56,078 --> 00:12:58,958
monitoring devices are powered by

456
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:01,199
electricity

457
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:02,479
and when the power went out so did my

458
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,200
device so i don't know what happened in

459
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,560
that room

460
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,639
during that power outage it could have

461
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:07,919
been a hundred and whatever degrees it

462
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,240
could have been four degrees i don't

463
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:09,360
know

464
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,639
it could have been fifty percent

465
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,360
humidity it could have been ninety

466
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,480
percent

467
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,639
i don't know i could only tell you that

468
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,839
i could feel it it was damp in there and

469
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,360
it was funky so

470
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:19,200
everything went out of control the

471
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,000
humidity the temperature it was all

472
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,639
wacky for quite

473
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,240
a while um all you can do is [ __ ]

474
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:25,278
hope for the best in that situation i

475
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,519
don't know what happened

476
00:13:25,278 --> 00:13:28,320
because i didn't have a monitor uh what

477
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,159
i can say is

478
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,160
hope for it to get back on schedule as

479
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:32,719
soon as possible when that power comes

480
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:34,719
on

481
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,079
go and check all of your timers go check

482
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,320
all of your settings and make sure

483
00:13:36,078 --> 00:13:40,399
everything is set exactly how you

484
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,519
thought it was check your light timer

485
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,839
check all of your pumps if you're

486
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,519
running hydro check all of those pumps

487
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,199
check all of your fans check your air

488
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:48,320
conditioner anything that plugs in that

489
00:13:47,198 --> 00:13:50,000
can [ __ ] up

490
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,360
check it when the power goes out because

491
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,600
it probably did

492
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,879
[ __ ] up uh where are we gonna go from

493
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,399
here i've got a lot of notes i feel like

494
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:58,958
i skipped something oh

495
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,000
if the power keeps going off and on uh

496
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:01,359
it was happening here

497
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,759
i think they were working on it down the

498
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,278
street so if the power goes off and on

499
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:06,639
if it's like on for a few minutes and

500
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:07,679
then it shuts off and then it comes on

501
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:08,720
it shuts off and you know it's going to

502
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:10,638
keep doing that

503
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,480
just unplug everything if you can flip

504
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:14,399
the breaker flip the [ __ ] breaker to

505
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:17,039
stop the power to that room because

506
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,799
it is very stressful on your grow lights

507
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:20,319
uh maybe some of the modern leds will

508
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:22,000
handle it but your hps

509
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,760
and your uh halide and your sodium

510
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,399
lights they're not going to handle off

511
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:27,519
and on

512
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:28,958
cycles that rapidly very well

513
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:30,240
excuse me got to clear my throat here

514
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:31,119
they're not going to handle the off and

515
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,639
on very well

516
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,639
it would be better for your equipment

517
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,079
just to unplug it let it be off for a

518
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:37,839
couple of hours once you're sure they've

519
00:14:36,078 --> 00:14:38,239
got their [ __ ] fixed then plug it back

520
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:39,600
in

521
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,360
and get it running that'll be better for

522
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,639
your equipment and probably better for

523
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,879
the plants

524
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:46,320
you don't want jumping humidity spikes

525
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:48,159
you don't want humidity dips you don't

526
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,360
want hot and cold all day

527
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:50,480
the plants are not going to know what to

528
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,839
do with that that's going to cause you

529
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,039
powdery mildew issues that's going to

530
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,720
cause problems

531
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:56,159
uh slower growth it's going to [ __ ]

532
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,600
things up in the grow also

533
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:59,519
that's going to mess up your bulbs those

534
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,480
bulbs only get so many strike times for

535
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,639
them to come on

536
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,159
if you have to strike it six times today

537
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,360
plus hot starts are not good

538
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:06,799
that'll slow down your ballast

539
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,159
performance and your bulb so it may be

540
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:09,919
best just to unplug it

541
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:12,240
and make sure it doesn't keep going off

542
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:13,599
and on i'm making sure i've got all my

543
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,839
notes covered here

544
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,680
um so make sure you reset everything

545
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,399
when it comes back on like i said before

546
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:20,638
everything

547
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:22,320
that can [ __ ] up when the power goes off

548
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,600
will [ __ ] up when the power goes off

549
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,240
you've got to get everything back in

550
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,320
sync

551
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,759
don't just assume that that fan is going

552
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,120
to come back on when you think it should

553
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:30,799
that air conditioner will come on that

554
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,360
those bubblers will cycle as you think

555
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:33,519
so

556
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,519
go ahead and check them part of being a

557
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:37,360
good grower and being an okay grower

558
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,959
is that eye for detail did you bother to

559
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,519
go check on all the settings did you

560
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:41,119
bother

561
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,799
to go make sure that things were correct

562
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,480
or did you just assume

563
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:46,399
hope and pray because assuming hoping

564
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,920
and praying might not get you there if

565
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:49,120
you physically got your stoned ass up

566
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:50,000
off the couch and went and looked you

567
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,679
know it's good

568
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,360
you've only got yourself to blame put

569
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:54,719
some pride into your work set yourself

570
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,240
up for success

571
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,480
go check on that [ __ ] dude it's that

572
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,839
easy i'm in love with my plants i'm in

573
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,920
love with my garden so

574
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:03,120
uh if i hear something make the wrong

575
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:04,559
noise i'm in there looking like what

576
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,278
made that noise what happened

577
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:08,000
i can hear from the garage from the

578
00:16:07,278 --> 00:16:09,759
driveway

579
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,278
i can hear the cycles of the house and i

580
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,240
know what should be happening and if i

581
00:16:11,278 --> 00:16:13,759
hear the wrong noise

582
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,360
before i'm even to the door i know

583
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,560
there's a problem that's how much i know

584
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,079
might grow

585
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:19,758
the other thing i wanted to mention on

586
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:22,239
this part is um

587
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:24,000
daylight savings time we just adjusted a

588
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,480
couple of weeks ago to daylight savings

589
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,480
time

590
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,159
my question for you is did you adjust

591
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,839
your grow room or did you adjust your

592
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:30,319
life to it because those plants didn't

593
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:31,839
care

594
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,600
that it was daylight savings time

595
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,360
they've been on 12 12 for so long did

596
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,759
you [ __ ] change that or did you just

597
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,278
let it ride send me an email grow from

598
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,919
your heart at hotmail.com let me know

599
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:41,439
what you did

600
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:42,399
for daylight savings time and what can

601
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,279
you what are you going to do when it

602
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,559
comes back

603
00:16:43,278 --> 00:16:46,159
because a lot of us have our lights

604
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:47,679
scheduled right before you leave for

605
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:48,958
work you got an hour when the lights

606
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:50,319
come on so you can water them

607
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:52,319
or maybe they come on right when you get

608
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,839
home from work how are you adjusting to

609
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,639
daylight savings time did you adjust

610
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:55,920
your life

611
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,360
or did you just go in there and straight

612
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:58,958
up change the [ __ ] timer in the

613
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,320
middle of a flowering cycle

614
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:02,239
let me know what you did grow from your

615
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,839

i've got a quick

630
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,280
question that is perfect the question

631
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:31,359
goes like this

632
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:33,119
have you ever heard of the paper bag

633
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:34,399
method we have recently started using

634
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:35,918
the paper bag method

635
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,000
and it seems to be working out pretty

636
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,960
well the only thing i'm running into is

637
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,960
that i'm still

638
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,679
having a little bit of a green taste to

639
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,200
it seven days after being in the bag

640
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,280
so i need to let it cure for another

641
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,679
seven to fourteen days or let it dry in

642
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:51,759
the bag for another three to seven days

643
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:54,000
i hope to hear from you soon this may be

644
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:55,599

method i've heard of the paper bag

665
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,559
method what is the paper bag method that

666
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:33,200
is drying

667
00:18:30,558 --> 00:18:35,038
and curing basically curing our cannabis

668
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,440
in a brown paper bag a lot of people

669
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:37,119
will

670
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,798
cut the plants down they'll let them

671
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:39,839
hang until they're dry until the stems

672
00:18:38,798 --> 00:18:42,000
snap a little bit

673
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:44,000
they do it perfectly right up until then

674
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,400
then when it comes to the curing process

675
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,839
they put them in a brown paper bag that

676
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,919
brown paper bag is then

677
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:51,439
rolled up and sealed up at the end some

678
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:53,280
people put it in the refrigerator

679
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,798
some people leave it in a cool dry dark

680
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:57,119
area some people

681
00:18:54,798 --> 00:18:59,119
do it different ways however i don't

682
00:18:57,119 --> 00:18:59,599
approve or like the brown paper bag

683
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:02,319
method

684
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:04,879
because it leaves a brown paper bag

685
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:07,200
flavor to your buds that is why i highly

686
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,320
always recommend drying and curing in

687
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,798
either glass

688
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:12,480
if you can or in plastic in a large

689
00:19:10,798 --> 00:19:14,319
commercial environment i will cure

690
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,759
in a plastic container a very big

691
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:16,720
plastic container we'll talk about that

692
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:19,440
in a moment

693
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,919
but i think that your product tastes

694
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,320
like

695
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:23,759
green and brown paper bag because you

696
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:26,639
are drying and curing

697
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:27,038
in a brown paper bag the idea is to get

698
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,480
the

699
00:19:27,038 --> 00:19:33,679
chlorophyll to release from those buds

700
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:35,200
so the moisture and the air create a gas

701
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:36,798
inside that environment when you seal

702
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,960
that bag up there's a

703
00:19:36,798 --> 00:19:40,960
an anaerobic gas is created in there

704
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,880
that gas will eat the chlorophyll

705
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,200
that chlorophyll then becomes a vapor

706
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:47,200
and needs to escape from the environment

707
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,720
it's not escaping it is getting stuck in

708
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,480
your brown paper bag

709
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,000
it is staying right there and that

710
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,798
flavor is just sticking

711
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,679
to your buds if you wrap those buds in

712
00:19:54,798 --> 00:19:57,440
uh something that

713
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:58,880
a sushi roll those buds are gonna taste

714
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,120
like a sushi roll if you wrap them in a

715
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,799
wet towel they'll taste like a wet towel

716
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:04,399
if you wrap your dried buds in a blunt

717
00:20:02,798 --> 00:20:05,679
wrap they taste like [ __ ] sorry that's

718
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,240
my opinion i just wanted to throw that

719
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:08,080
out there

720
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,679
if you wrap your wet buds in a brown

721
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:11,359
paper bag they're going to taste like a

722
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:12,960
brown paper bag and chlorophyll so

723
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:16,000
that's why i believe you are getting

724
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,480
this non-desirable flavor and aroma i

725
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,119
never

726
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,000
ever recommend drying in cardboard or

727
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:22,319
paper bags or

728
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,519
anything like that that paper material

729
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:25,359
will hold the moisture

730
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:27,119
that moisture will hold the chlorophyll

731
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:30,079
that chlorophyll will put that flavor

732
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:32,079
right back into your buds so i prefer i

733
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:33,279
recommend drying in glass or large

734
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:34,480
plastic containers

735
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:36,000
the way you want to do it and this is

736
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,120
just a quick method of how i would

737
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,200
recommend doing it

738
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:41,519
cut the plants down get the big leaves

739
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,440
off of them let them hang until the stem

740
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:45,119
snap you want those stems popping not

741
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,960
exploding but cracking

742
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:48,479
at that point trim them you want i

743
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,159
prefer a dry trim i think it's much

744
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,319
easier it's much quicker

745
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:53,440
it's not as messy i just think it's much

746
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:55,759
more efficient so

747
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,720
hang them uh take off the big leaves let

748
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:58,480
them dry

749
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,319
cut it into smaller pieces and trim it

750
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:03,919
up at that point put it into

751
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:05,519
a glass jar fill the glass jar about 90

752
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:08,799
of the way full you want some room for

753
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:11,519
air in there put those buds in the jar

754
00:21:08,798 --> 00:21:12,240
i am very ocd also i'm very committed to

755
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:14,079
my grow

756
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,480
i'm able to do these things i set a

757
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:17,279
timer for 30 minutes when i first put

758
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,679
them in the jar

759
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:21,200
seal up that jar 30 minutes 30 minutes

760
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,880
later i come back i dump them out of the

761
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,720
jar let those buds sit for a minute make

762
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,679
sure they're not too sticky too tacky

763
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,279
too wet

764
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:28,960
if i agree if i believe that they are

765
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:30,000
the appropriate moisture level to put

766
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,079
back in the jar

767
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,079
they go back in the jar i seal it up now

768
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:36,079
i set my alarm for about an hour

769
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:37,199
i come back i check in an hour pour the

770
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:38,960
buds out of the jar

771
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,120
feel them are they ready to go back in

772
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,079
the jar maybe i jarred too early this is

773
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:44,158
my opportunity

774
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:45,678
to say i'm gonna [ __ ] this up i'm not

775
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:47,280
going to put them back in the jar yet

776
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,720
so i'll let them sit out until i feel

777
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:50,558
like they're right this is kind of an

778
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,079
art form you have to learn this

779
00:21:50,558 --> 00:21:53,519
they don't want to be so wet that the

780
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:54,399
buds if you squeeze them you don't want

781
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:56,000
it to stay

782
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,000
flattened you want it spongy to where it

783
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,519
pops back up but you also don't want it

784
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,480
so dry that when you squeeze it it turns

785
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:01,599
to dust

786
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,679
you want to put it in there to where

787
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:04,079
there's enough moisture in the jar to

788
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:06,240
trigger

789
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:07,119
the reaction to make the anaerobes eat

790
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,640
the chlorophyll

791
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:10,239
but you don't want it so moist in there

792
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,120
that you're going to create a moldy

793
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,720
environment

794
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:14,319
so now is your opportunity to check it

795
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,079
out check it the first hour

796
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:17,599
if it's appropriate put it back in the

797
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:19,599
jar if not let it sit

798
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:21,519
if it sits out for a while catch up with

799
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:22,879
us to this step put it back in the jar

800
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:24,720
we've all got our buds dried

801
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,720
appropriately put them back in the jar

802
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,319
set a timer i'm gonna set a timer for

803
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,798
another hour depending on how

804
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:32,639
sticky those buds were one to two hours

805
00:22:30,798 --> 00:22:34,240
i'm gonna come back and check on them

806
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,080
at this point we are starting the curing

807
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,440
process they're not too moist i'm sure

808
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:38,960
they're not too moist they can go in the

809
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,880
jar for an extended time

810
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,240
i'm gonna check on them every four hours

811
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,200
for the next two days

812
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:47,120
pop open that jar let it sit for 10

813
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,919
maybe 20 minutes depending on the level

814
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:50,239
of moisture

815
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:51,038
and the aromas that come out of that jar

816
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,359
if it still

817
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:54,319
feels sticky and moist when you touch

818
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:56,158
the buds

819
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:58,000
give it a little more time if they're

820
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:59,520
starting to dry out don't give it so

821
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,839
much time

822
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:02,960
then slowly increase your time that it's

823
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:05,759
left in that jar

824
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,558
you can go from four hours to six hours

825
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:09,599
to eight

826
00:23:06,558 --> 00:23:11,519
to twelve eventually 24 36 48 hours

827
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:14,480
before you burp that jar

828
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:16,240
don't leave it closed too long too early

829
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:18,558
is the major thing to look at

830
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:20,319
if you can do multiple jars if you can

831
00:23:18,558 --> 00:23:22,000
set up like four or five jars from your

832
00:23:20,319 --> 00:23:23,599
harvest and only open this one every

833
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,599
so often and this one longer and this

834
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:27,359
one longer maybe

835
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:29,038
maybe see what happens if you do longer

836
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:30,879
and shorter periods you've got to

837
00:23:29,038 --> 00:23:32,319
experiment a little bit with curing

838
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,640
i wish i could give you perfect

839
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:36,079
parameters but your environment is what

840
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,120
is going to play the most into your

841
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:40,158
drying and curing

842
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:41,519
uh differences it's i'm in colorado it's

843
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:43,840
cold and dry here

844
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:44,798
i can dry and cure herb super quickly if

845
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:46,720
you're in florida

846
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:48,319
it's going to be super moist it's going

847
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,278
to take a lot longer for your herb to

848
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:51,038
dry so

849
00:23:49,278 --> 00:23:52,640
your environment and how wet the buds

850
00:23:51,038 --> 00:23:54,400
were when they went into the curing

851
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,240
container are going to determine

852
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,000
how often and how soon you need to open

853
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:00,640
those jars so don't let

854
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,759
my advice [ __ ] you up if you're in a if

855
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,278
you got wetter buds

856
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:04,798
do it sooner and more often if they're

857
00:24:03,278 --> 00:24:07,440
drier do it less

858
00:24:04,798 --> 00:24:09,200
and longer intervals that's my advice so

859
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,600
i said i would do it in large

860
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,798
plastic containers if i had a lot of

861
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:14,158
product

862
00:24:12,798 --> 00:24:16,558
i am known for running commercial

863
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:18,640
cultivation facilities i'm a commercial

864
00:24:16,558 --> 00:24:20,399
cultivation consultant you can hire me

865
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,000
i will go to your commercial cultivation

866
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,320
facility i'll spend a day there

867
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,400
looking at your grow seeing what kind of

868
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:28,158
strategy you have seeing what kind of

869
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,480
standard operating procedures you are

870
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:32,080
using i'll learn the staff a little bit

871
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,519
i'll see who is on top of their game and

872
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:34,240
the staff i'll see where your weakest

873
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:36,240
link is

874
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,919
and i can make recommendations on how to

875
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,759
improve the overall performance of your

876
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:41,038
facility in a short amount of time that

877
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:42,879
is my job

878
00:24:41,038 --> 00:24:44,319
part of my job is improving people's

879
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,799
drying and curing method

880
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:48,158
i see a lot of wacky [ __ ] so let's talk

881
00:24:46,798 --> 00:24:49,839
about the way i do it in a commercial

882
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:51,840
environment we do it the same way

883
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:53,918
we start the same way as the glass jar

884
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:55,599
method and a small cultivation

885
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,120
cut the plant take off the big leaves

886
00:24:55,599 --> 00:24:58,798
cut the plants down hang them upside

887
00:24:57,119 --> 00:25:01,519
down until the stems pop

888
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:02,558
when those stems start to pop i will cut

889
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:04,720
the bigger

890
00:25:02,558 --> 00:25:06,480
buds and branches off of the plants and

891
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,600
leave that main stock so you got the big

892
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,759
stock with the main

893
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:11,199
christmas tree coming out the menorah

894
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:12,240
cut all the buds off of that now you

895
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,759
just got the menorah

896
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,278
that part goes in another area that's

897
00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:16,400
got to get weighed and accounted for

898
00:25:15,278 --> 00:25:17,519
before we can throw it away that's

899
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,200
another story

900
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:21,200
i will take those big buds they're

901
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:24,000
probably the length of my arm

902
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:25,600
somewhere between 16 and 30 inches long

903
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,599
yes we do grow buds that big in a

904
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:29,839
commercial cultivation facility

905
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:31,278
we fill the room with those buds we chop

906
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:34,558
them until they will fit into

907
00:25:31,278 --> 00:25:38,000
a large sterlite or rubbermaid

908
00:25:34,558 --> 00:25:40,240
container it's about uh 30 inches long

909
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,079
maybe 36 32 inches long

910
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,759
it's about a foot and a half tall and

911
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:44,960
it's got a lid that goes on top of it

912
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:46,640
you all know about the storage

913
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,558
containers i'm talking about

914
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,559
if you've moved they're used used for

915
00:25:48,558 --> 00:25:52,399
moving if you ship groceries i see a lot

916
00:25:50,558 --> 00:25:54,480
of groceries shipped in these things

917
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,919
it's a sterlite storage container you

918
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,599
can get them at target you can get them

919
00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:00,000
just about anywhere you buy plastic

920
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:00,959
stuff those are great for drying and

921
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,119
curing your product

922
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,640
if you have a large amount of product i

923
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:06,399
know they are not airtight we're going

924
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:09,120
to get to that in a moment

925
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:11,038
but i take my plants and i will put the

926
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:12,798
plants inside of those containers

927
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:14,879
i'll mark the date that they went into

928
00:26:12,798 --> 00:26:17,200
that container and then i will put them

929
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:19,039
in a dry and cure room now let's talk

930
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,200
about my dry and cure room this is why

931
00:26:19,038 --> 00:26:24,240
the containers don't need to be airtight

932
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:27,038
i have got a humidifier on a controller

933
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,759
that every time it gets below or above

934
00:26:27,038 --> 00:26:30,558
50

935
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:31,919
humidity that dehumidifier comes on i

936
00:26:30,558 --> 00:26:33,759
don't know if i said humidifier or

937
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:35,679
dehumidifier in the first round but

938
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:37,679
my point is i've got both devices i have

939
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:38,240
a humidifier and a dehumidifier in the

940
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:40,480
room

941
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,839
both set to 50 percent now they are

942
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,919
fighting all day long

943
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:45,519
it's going to stay 50 percent stays

944
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:48,720
about somewhere between

945
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:50,000
45 and 55 maybe 60 to 50 percent uh

946
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,480
relative humidity in that room

947
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,400
constantly with those two devices going

948
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,679
it's colorado it gets hot it gets cold

949
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,600
it gets dry it gets wet

950
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:59,278
so the devices do have to adjust to the

951
00:26:57,599 --> 00:27:00,000
normal they have to fight the normal

952
00:26:59,278 --> 00:27:02,798
atmosphere

953
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,119
but for the most part it is 50 relative

954
00:27:02,798 --> 00:27:07,038
humidity in my drying and curing room

955
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:08,719
so i've got those sterlite bins filled

956
00:27:07,038 --> 00:27:09,919
with buds they're mostly airtight they

957
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,000
seal up pretty well

958
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:14,159
but then to compensate for the lack of

959
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,159
seal in there i make the entire room

960
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:18,480
ideal for those plants to be dried and

961
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:19,760
cured in i also dried those plants in

962
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,759
that room with the 50

963
00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:23,919
relative humidity and the perfect

964
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:24,879
temperature in there usually about 75

965
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:27,120
degrees depends on

966
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,559
like i said outside factors uh other

967
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:29,599
environmental factors make a huge

968
00:27:28,558 --> 00:27:31,038
difference but

969
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:32,639
that's the way we do it in a commercial

970
00:27:31,038 --> 00:27:34,240
environment then uh

971
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,759
i've got a person that used to be mike

972
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,120
he used to be ernie uh there are a

973
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:38,720
couple other guys that i've taught very

974
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:40,000
well how to dry and cure buds in a

975
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,159
commercial environment

976
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,200
you got to take all those big bins line

977
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:45,120
them up on the floor

978
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,720
pop the lids off of every single one of

979
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:48,719
them go and put your hand in there and

980
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,240
see the moisture level of those buds

981
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,600
i like to turn them over i don't let

982
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,960
them sit with the bottom buds on the

983
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:54,480
bottom the entire time

984
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,558
flip them those bottom buds need some

985
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:59,599
fresh air too so they can dry properly

986
00:27:56,558 --> 00:28:00,798
flip them over so i will open them all

987
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:02,158
up we will leave them open for a

988
00:28:00,798 --> 00:28:03,759
determined amount of time

989
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:05,440
like i said before if they're brand new

990
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:06,960
they'll stay open for maybe an hour on a

991
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:09,200
commercial grow in that 50

992
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:11,038
room then we'll seal them back up maybe

993
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,640
it'll just be 15 minutes maybe we pop

994
00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:14,398
them open and go oh these are ready

995
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,679
when we go oh these are ready that's

996
00:28:14,398 --> 00:28:17,038
when they get trimmed they don't even

997
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:18,960
get trimmed all the way

998
00:28:17,038 --> 00:28:21,200
until they're done being dried and cured

999
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,798
we can keep them in stasis in that room

1000
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,240
and they get perfect for the trim crew

1001
00:28:22,798 --> 00:28:25,839
and when we need them we just go get

1002
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,519
them we can catch up

1003
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:29,199
that way it's not a struggle to be

1004
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:30,720
trimming everything all at once we take

1005
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,640
down uh

1006
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,919
50 to 100 lights worth of plants all at

1007
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,520
once you don't want to have to scramble

1008
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:37,038
to trim that all today

1009
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:38,398
you can get it bucked down you can get

1010
00:28:37,038 --> 00:28:39,359
it in those containers get it in the dry

1011
00:28:38,398 --> 00:28:41,918
and cure bins

1012
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:43,599
get it in a stasis situation and then

1013
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:45,120
when you need it go ahead and trim it

1014
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:46,798
get it bagged up send it out to the

1015
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:47,839
stores that's the way we do it in a big

1016
00:28:46,798 --> 00:28:51,200
grill i use the big

1017
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:54,879
plastic bins in a room that is dialed in

1018
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:56,319
all right so um i hope i did not ruin

1019
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,640
your hopes and dreams by saying that

1020
00:28:56,319 --> 00:29:00,158
your cure method does need improvement

1021
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,600
i think as long as you're drying and

1022
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:02,080
curing in paper bags you're going to

1023
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:05,038
have

1024
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:07,199
a chlorophyll and brown paper bag taste

1025
00:29:05,038 --> 00:29:09,599
glass jars are not expensive

1026
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,640
ironically there are not any glass jars

1027
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:12,639
available

1028
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:15,120
anywhere right now we are in a pandemic

1029
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:17,440
situation and i think everybody decided

1030
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:19,199
to can their product or they all harvest

1031
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,320
it early because glass jars are hard to

1032
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,759
find right now

1033
00:29:20,319 --> 00:29:24,158
good luck with that but that's what i

1034
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:24,879
recommend glass jars if you cannot find

1035
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:26,559
glass i

1036
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,960
recommend plastic as my second

1037
00:29:26,558 --> 00:29:30,798
recommendation go for the medical grade

1038
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,919
plastic if you can the quality food

1039
00:29:30,798 --> 00:29:34,000
grade plastics

1040
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:35,759
if not do what you've got to do but get

1041
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,038
away from that brown paper bag

1042
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:39,759
i don't think you're ever going to be

1043
00:29:37,038 --> 00:29:40,798
satisfied you're like crippling yourself

1044
00:29:39,759 --> 00:29:41,440
you're running you're running you're

1045
00:29:40,798 --> 00:29:42,720
about to

1046
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,600
win the race and then right at the end

1047
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,798
of the race you're like [ __ ] i'm

1048
00:29:43,599 --> 00:29:46,959
gonna sit down and just

1049
00:29:44,798 --> 00:29:48,158
eat a sandwich you could have won but

1050
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,360
instead you put your [ __ ] in a brown

1051
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:51,039
paper bag

1052
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:52,479
don't do that anymore let's upgrade your

1053
00:29:51,038 --> 00:29:53,839
garden let's upgrade your game let's

1054
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:56,480
start drying and curing and

1055
00:29:53,839 --> 00:29:56,879
glass if you can plastic is your next

1056
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,038
bet

1057
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:01,520
i've also seen people do it in stainless

1058
00:29:59,038 --> 00:30:02,960
steel containers that would work for me

1059
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:05,038
sounds expensive to buy a bunch of

1060
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:07,679
stainless steel containers however

1061
00:30:05,038 --> 00:30:08,558
if that works you do that all right jake

1062
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:10,000
i want to thank you for the great

1063
