85
00:03:16,359 --> 00:03:19,840
call from an unfamiliar number I

86
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:21,219
answered it and they said is this Jeff

87
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,200
and I said that's me and they said hey

88
00:03:21,219 --> 00:03:24,519

91

93
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:33,609

00:03:31,509 --> 00:03:36,729

95
00:03:33,609 --> 00:03:38,590
and I said holy [ __ ] I live about two

96
00:03:36,729 --> 00:03:41,409
hours from Comedy Works so I had to

97
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:43,180
regroup my day rearrange my plans that

98
00:03:41,409 --> 00:03:45,459
didn't take much effort but I knew that

99
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:46,870
my next mission was to call Clint and

100
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:48,729
make sure that Clint could get off of

101
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:50,949
work early so that we could travel up to

102
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:52,590
Denver so I made the quick call I said

103
00:03:50,949 --> 00:03:54,910
Clint bro I've got a major emergency

104
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:56,709

105
00:03:54,909 --> 00:03:59,229

108
00:04:01,359 --> 00:04:06,280
so Clint showed up to my house around

109
00:04:03,579 --> 00:04:08,349
3:30 allegedly we may or may not have

110
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:10,359
gotten a little bit medicated we made

111
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:12,009
the adventure up to Denver traffic was

112
00:04:10,359 --> 00:04:14,109
kind of a little [ __ ] that night but we

113
00:04:12,009 --> 00:04:16,149

115
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:19,750
6:28

116
00:04:17,259 --> 00:04:22,449

117
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:25,509

118

00:04:29,829 --> 00:04:34,719
Works is in my opinion one of the best

122
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:37,120
to comedy clubs on the planet and they

123
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,039
treat me like a VIP rock star every time

124
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,840
I go there they all remember my name

125
00:04:39,038 --> 00:04:42,818
they greet me by name they all have a

126
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:45,399
smile on their face they remember what I

127
00:04:42,819 --> 00:04:47,110
order when I get snacks and drinks so

128
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:48,129

129
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:49,780

131
00:04:49,779 --> 00:04:54,189

134
00:04:55,478 --> 00:04:59,529
then also big shout out to Clint for

135
00:04:57,668 --> 00:05:01,629
being able to get off work a little bit

136
00:04:59,529 --> 00:05:03,908
early and make it to an awesome comedy

137
00:05:01,629 --> 00:05:05,829
show Tom Segura made it clear that he

138
00:05:03,908 --> 00:05:07,990
did not have a lot of new material he

139
00:05:05,829 --> 00:05:09,758
just put out a comedy special so he's

140
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:11,530
got an hour of brand-new material out

141
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,240
there it's available on Netflix really

142
00:05:11,529 --> 00:05:15,399
soon you'll be able to watch that but

143
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:17,019
when a comedian puts out a special they

144
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:18,519
don't do that material anymore that's

145
00:05:17,019 --> 00:05:20,198
like old [ __ ] you don't want to go to

146
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:22,209
the comedy club and see the special that

147
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:25,090
you just watched on Netflix so he is

148
00:05:22,209 --> 00:05:26,560
working on a brand new hour of material

149
00:05:25,089 --> 00:05:28,658
and he stopped if the Comedy Works in

150
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:32,019
Denver to run some of his new jokes by

151
00:05:28,658 --> 00:05:34,360
us most of his new material is [ __ ]

152
00:05:32,019 --> 00:05:36,758
hilarious a couple of jokes were kind of

153
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:38,468
duds but it was even funnier watching

154
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:40,780
Tom Segura throw out a joke that was

155
00:05:38,468 --> 00:05:41,949
kind of like and that needs work bro but

156
00:05:40,779 --> 00:05:43,329
he would look at the crowd be like is

157
00:05:41,949 --> 00:05:45,129
there something there and it was just

158
00:05:43,329 --> 00:05:47,139
real funny it's a small club so you can

159
00:05:45,129 --> 00:05:48,968
he can see all of our faces it's a real

160
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:51,370
intimate experience I thought it was

161
00:05:48,968 --> 00:05:52,718
great big thanks to Tom Segura for

162
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:55,030
dropping into the comedy works on a

163
00:05:52,718 --> 00:05:56,949

head right now welcome back everybody I

217
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:48,230
just took a ridiculous dab of the Malibu

218
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,850
pure Kush kind of feels like I am

219
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:51,530
swimming underwater while I'm sitting

220
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:53,510
here at this table feels like I put a

221
00:07:51,529 --> 00:07:55,849
little while has cemented my face down

222
00:07:53,509 --> 00:07:58,250
my eyes are super heavy my arms are

223
00:07:55,850 --> 00:08:00,860
super ridiculously heavy I kinda wish I

224
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:03,139
had a seatbelt on my chair right now I

225

229
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:13,579
question I would love to hear from you

230
00:08:11,149 --> 00:08:16,399

at hotmail.com the first email on

232
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:22,639
today's episode goes just like this it

233
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:24,710
says hello I am on day 60 a flower with

234
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:27,860
orange gasm the plants look and smell

235
00:08:24,709 --> 00:08:29,509
amazing my question is does day one of

236
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:32,019
flowers start the day you flipped it

237
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:34,610
twelve twelve or when you see the first

238
00:08:32,019 --> 00:08:36,590
flowers my next grow will be lemon

239
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:39,529
Jeffrey I'm looking forward to that one

240
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:40,849
I really enjoy your podcast they did not

241
00:08:39,529 --> 00:08:42,709
sign their name I don't know if they

242
00:08:40,849 --> 00:08:44,210
want their name set on the show they

243
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:46,009
know who they are big shout out big

244
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:47,780
thank you for the great question I get

245
00:08:46,009 --> 00:08:50,480
this question a lot so I will try to

246
00:08:47,779 --> 00:08:52,120
answer it very clearly right now when

247
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:56,240
you are working in an indoor environment

248
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:58,610
day one of flower is when you flip those

249
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,159
lights to twelve twelve or whatever

250
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:03,259
desired flowering cycle you are going to

251
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:05,329
work with that is day one that's when

252
00:09:03,259 --> 00:09:07,819
you start counting day one of flower if

253
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:10,100
I've recommended sixty to seventy days

254
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:13,760
that is when the day one begins is when

255
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:15,980
you change the light cycle in most cases

256
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:18,379
you're not going to see any flowers or

257
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:20,450
pre flowers until around day ten twelve

258
00:09:18,379 --> 00:09:22,970
fourteen maybe a little bit further in

259
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:25,550
so if you start counting that as day one

260
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:27,830
you are already ten twelve or fourteen

261
00:09:25,549 --> 00:09:29,870
days behind schedule you were way off

262
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:31,730
none of your feed charts are gonna match

263
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:34,340
none of the recommendations I make are

264
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:36,860
going to match day one is when you flip

265
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:38,960
those lights to your twelve twelve or

266
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:41,330
your eleven thirteen flowering cycle

267
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:43,370
they wrap this message up by saying my

268
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:45,440
next grow will be lemon Jeffrey and I

269
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:47,179
look forward to that one I look forward

270
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,460

284
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:21,820
to say I have started collecting and

285
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:23,200
popping your seeds I really appreciate

286
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:25,240
that I love that you're popping the

287
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,640
seeds and I really love that people are

288
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:30,070
collecting the seeds and the genetics

289
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:31,299
that I have made and created I did not

290
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:33,640
know that would be a thing when I

291
00:10:31,299 --> 00:10:35,319
started making seeds for people I didn't

292
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:37,480
know when I put packages out that people

293
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:39,310
would stash them and hoard them and try

294
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:41,409
to collect all of them like Pokemon or

295
00:10:39,309 --> 00:10:43,509
baseball cards but I love that people

296
00:10:41,409 --> 00:10:45,339
are trying to catch them all that really

297
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:47,889
means a lot to me I'm going to keep

298
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:51,220
going on the email it says while I'm on

299
00:10:47,889 --> 00:10:54,460
a Fino hunt should i top these first run

300
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:56,800
seed plants or not I normally taught my

301
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:58,780
clones two to three times will I be

302
00:10:56,799 --> 00:11:00,549
affecting these seed plants by topping

303
00:10:58,779 --> 00:11:02,709
them because I'm looking for the best

304
00:11:00,549 --> 00:11:04,689
one but I'm thinking maybe I should let

305
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:07,629
them go naturally during the pheno hein

306
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:10,150
during the pheno hunt my plan was to top

307
00:11:07,629 --> 00:11:13,029
thinking I could get more side growth

308
00:11:10,149 --> 00:11:16,209
for cloning I would love your view on

309
00:11:13,029 --> 00:11:18,189
this topic thank you from Scott from

310
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:19,840

my new buddy Scott out there in Clayton

312
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:25,600
Washington let's talk a little bit about

313
00:11:22,299 --> 00:11:29,379
topping or not topping our Fino hunt

314
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,879
plants this is a very good question some

315
00:11:29,379 --> 00:11:32,919
people may not understand what I'm

316
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:35,200
talking about when it comes to talking

317
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:36,639
about topping and Fino hunting so let's

318
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,740
do a little bit of a catch up

319
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:40,960
this person has purchased a pack of

320
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:42,940
seeds and they're running the seeds they

321
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:45,070
don't know which of those seeds are

322
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:46,960
going to be the keepers there may be a

323
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:48,879
really stellar plant that works really

324
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:50,830
well for this person's garden or their

325
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:52,990
medical condition or whatever they are

326
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:54,040
looking for that plant may be in this

327
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:57,220
package of seeds

328
00:11:54,039 --> 00:11:59,980
there will be genetic variation amongst

329
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:02,259
each seed in that package so when we run

330
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:05,168
a seam pack for the first time our main

331
00:12:02,259 --> 00:12:07,539
goal with that first run is to find the

332
00:12:05,168 --> 00:12:09,100
keeper in that pack that works for you

333
00:12:07,539 --> 00:12:12,099
and you do that by doing what is called

334
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:14,889
a FINA hunt you grow your seeds you take

335
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:17,109
notes you take pictures you document the

336
00:12:14,889 --> 00:12:19,058
grow then you harvest those plants and

337
00:12:17,109 --> 00:12:20,439
you smoke them and you document which

338
00:12:19,058 --> 00:12:22,448
one you like the best

339
00:12:20,438 --> 00:12:24,248
hopefully the one that grew the best for

340
00:12:22,448 --> 00:12:26,108
you and produce the best and was the

341
00:12:24,249 --> 00:12:28,569
easiest to function and work with is the

342
00:12:26,109 --> 00:12:29,859
one that smokes the best also but that

343
00:12:28,568 --> 00:12:31,748
is very rarely the case

344
00:12:29,859 --> 00:12:33,850
so this person is going through the

345
00:12:31,749 --> 00:12:35,199
process that we call a phyno hunt they

346
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:36,879
are going to sprout their seeds they're

347
00:12:35,198 --> 00:12:38,708
going to veg them then they're going to

348
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:40,028
flower them then they will dry them and

349
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:42,368
cure them and smoke them and they'll see

350
00:12:40,028 --> 00:12:44,528
which plant works the best for their

351
00:12:42,369 --> 00:12:46,389
needs then they will probably eliminate

352
00:12:44,528 --> 00:12:48,879
the remaining plants and keep that one

353
00:12:46,389 --> 00:12:50,829
plant to work with for the future that

354
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:53,199
way they can take clones from that one

355
00:12:50,828 --> 00:12:54,938
plant and have a reliable medicine over

356
00:12:53,198 --> 00:12:56,708
and over again they can develop a

357
00:12:54,938 --> 00:12:58,928
relationship with this one plant and

358
00:12:56,708 --> 00:13:01,118
learn how much calcium it likes how much

359
00:12:58,928 --> 00:13:03,338
potassium it likes exactly how long to

360
00:13:01,119 --> 00:13:05,319
flower it you can learn the quirks and

361
00:13:03,339 --> 00:13:06,819
tics of each plant by growing it

362
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:08,918
multiple times and developing a

363
00:13:06,818 --> 00:13:11,498
relationship with it so this person is

364
00:13:08,918 --> 00:13:13,838
in the process of starting a phyno hunt

365
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:16,600
now the other part of this question is

366
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:18,009
do they want to top their plants during

367
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,869
a Fino hunt they don't know what they've

368
00:13:18,009 --> 00:13:22,269
got they would like to see the full

369
00:13:19,869 --> 00:13:25,209
potential of these plants and they don't

370
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:26,739
want to lessen or degrade the outcome of

371
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:29,318
these plants by doing any sort of

372
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:31,600
experimental tactics to them so their

373
00:13:29,318 --> 00:13:33,849
question is should they top these plants

374
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,409
because a top plant will produce more a

375
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:37,629
top plant will give you if it's done

376
00:13:35,409 --> 00:13:39,428
correctly and properly timed a topped

377
00:13:37,629 --> 00:13:41,199
plant will give you more product more

378
00:13:39,428 --> 00:13:42,938
buds it will also give you more

379
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:44,948
branching because this listener said

380
00:13:42,938 --> 00:13:47,918
they wanted to top it to create more

381
00:13:44,948 --> 00:13:50,498
branching to get more side growth for

382
00:13:47,918 --> 00:13:53,318
cloning which does make great sense so

383
00:13:50,499 --> 00:13:56,048
the question here is do i top my Fino

384
00:13:53,318 --> 00:13:57,698
hunt plants from seeds when I don't know

385
00:13:56,048 --> 00:14:00,668
what I'm working with but I would still

386
00:13:57,698 --> 00:14:03,008
like to see their full potential now I

387
00:14:00,668 --> 00:14:04,448
did reply through email to this listener

388
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:06,339
because I did not want them to have to

389
00:14:04,448 --> 00:14:08,708
wait for me to put this podcast together

390
00:14:06,339 --> 00:14:11,289
to get some useful advice out of me what

391
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:13,388
I said was my quick answer is that if

392
00:14:11,288 --> 00:14:16,179
you intend to top your plants in the

393
00:14:13,389 --> 00:14:18,039
next runs top them as Fino hunters

394
00:14:16,179 --> 00:14:21,219
if you generally don't top your plants

395
00:14:18,039 --> 00:14:23,500
in the next runs don't top them as Fino

396
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:24,759
hunters so if you do top top them

397
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,409
because that's what you're going to be

398
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:28,870
doing in your environment we need to

399
00:14:26,409 --> 00:14:30,909
know if these plants work when you top

400
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:32,649
them if that's what you normally do do

401
00:14:30,909 --> 00:14:36,129
it if it's not what you normally do

402
00:14:32,649 --> 00:14:38,019
don't do it this advice only applies if

403
00:14:36,129 --> 00:14:40,779
you are running a test garden for

404
00:14:38,019 --> 00:14:43,419
yourself if you are running a test grow

405
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:45,459
for a breeder such as myself or any

406
00:14:43,419 --> 00:14:47,740
other breeder who is gifted you seeds

407
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:50,170
with the intention of feedback whether

408
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:51,820
that's in the form of photos or grow

409
00:14:50,169 --> 00:14:54,039
reports or maybe you smoke some of the

410
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:56,470
finished product with them if you were

411
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:59,139
running tester seeds for a breeder do

412
00:14:56,470 --> 00:15:02,200
not top them do not do any weird [ __ ] to

413
00:14:59,139 --> 00:15:05,049
them do not do any weird experimentation

414
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:07,330
on tester seeds put all of the test

415
00:15:05,049 --> 00:15:09,129
seeds in a grow room give them all the

416
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:11,860
same environment give them all the same

417
00:15:09,129 --> 00:15:14,590
treatment do the exact same thing to all

418
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:16,480
of them vej them just long enough to

419
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:19,389
make them grow flower them out

420
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:21,580
immediately take a lot of photos take a

421
00:15:19,389 --> 00:15:24,009
lot of notes get those notes and photos

422
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:25,900
to the breeder get them dried and cured

423
00:15:24,009 --> 00:15:27,819
and finished up as soon as possible so

424
00:15:25,899 --> 00:15:30,459
that you can smoke them so that you can

425
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:32,260
give your breeder a quality smoke report

426
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:34,450
we want to find out if the seeds we

427
00:15:32,259 --> 00:15:36,370
created are worth a [ __ ] and we need to

428
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:38,500
know pretty quickly we don't need them

429
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:40,840
topped and twist it and Lolly popped and

430
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:43,059
trellis now we don't need 9 weeks worth

431
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:46,300
of work on a tester plant we want that

432
00:15:43,059 --> 00:15:49,359
done I think you can veg for 3045 days

433
00:15:46,299 --> 00:15:52,929
then flip them in a perfect world my

434
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:55,240
test seeds are done in 90 to 120 days

435
00:15:52,929 --> 00:15:57,969
for a full cycle that is germination

436
00:15:55,240 --> 00:16:00,009
that is veg that is flower then you cut

437
00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:02,440
them down dry them cure them smoke them

438
00:16:00,009 --> 00:16:03,939
send me reports so if you are running a

439
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:05,290
Fino hunt for yourself and you're

440
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:06,190
looking for something that works well

441
00:16:05,289 --> 00:16:09,069
into your garden

442
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:11,230
due to those Fino hunting plants what

443
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:13,060
you're going to do to them in your main

444
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:15,279
garden we need to know how they're going

445
00:16:13,059 --> 00:16:17,199
to perform under that environment but

446
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:18,610
those seeds you probably paid money for

447
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,470
and we know that they're reliable

448
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:22,060
they've been tested we know they're not

449
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:23,440
hermaphrodites we know they're not a

450
00:16:22,059 --> 00:16:24,969
bunch of mutants we know that they're

451
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,520
going to be a good ratio of male to

452
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:30,089
females in those seeds so those seeds it

453
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:32,129
is ok to dedicate some time to

454
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:34,319
some work with them if you want to the

455
00:16:32,129 --> 00:16:35,730
tester seeds don't spend a lot of time

456
00:16:34,318 --> 00:16:37,169
on them because we don't know if those

457
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:38,879
are hermaphrodites we don't know if

458
00:16:37,169 --> 00:16:41,490
they're mutants those could be all boys

459
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:43,139
they could just be trash genetics we

460
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:45,058
don't know what we have created when we

461
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:47,669
send you testers and we're relying on

462
00:16:45,058 --> 00:16:49,289
the testers to give us quality results

463
00:16:47,669 --> 00:16:51,120
and we really don't want to wait eight

464
00:16:49,289 --> 00:16:53,129
weeks for you to veg a plant out and

465
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,929
mainline it do all kinds of weird [ __ ]

466
00:16:53,129 --> 00:16:56,938
and then we find out you only did two of

467
00:16:54,929 --> 00:16:58,438
them and we sent you twenty seeds we

468
00:16:56,938 --> 00:17:00,360
were really hoping you did twenty of

469
00:16:58,438 --> 00:17:02,578
them side by side just did them real

470
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:04,558
small don't do a lot of experiments the

471
00:17:02,578 --> 00:17:06,058
experiment is are these worthless [ __ ]

472
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:08,639
we want to find out if they're any good

473
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:11,038
so those are two different types of

474
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,409
phenyl hunting environments in both

475
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:16,109
environments I do recommend you treat

476
00:17:13,409 --> 00:17:18,028
all plants the same if you are phenol

477
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:19,769
hunting and you feed this plant one

478
00:17:18,028 --> 00:17:21,568
thing and this plant another how do you

479
00:17:19,769 --> 00:17:23,459
know if that plan is better and that

480
00:17:21,568 --> 00:17:24,898
plan is not better that's like giving me

481
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:26,909
steroids and the guy that I've got a

482
00:17:24,898 --> 00:17:28,168
fight not giving him steroids I'm gonna

483
00:17:26,909 --> 00:17:30,750
kick the [ __ ] out of him cuz I'm on

484
00:17:28,169 --> 00:17:32,309
steroids if you give both of us steroids

485
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:33,929
it's still a fair fight if you don't

486
00:17:32,308 --> 00:17:35,519
give either one of us steroids it's

487
00:17:33,929 --> 00:17:37,140
still a fair fight I would never take

488
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:39,418
steroids guys I just picked a weird way

489
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:41,278
to describe that but when you were doing

490
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:44,250
phenyl hunts when you were doing testing

491
00:17:41,278 --> 00:17:45,960
feed everything the same treat every

492
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:48,240
plant the same if you're going to

493
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:50,009
lollipop one plant volley pop all of the

494
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,259
other plants if you're gonna top one top

495
00:17:50,009 --> 00:17:55,440
all of the others when you do a phenol

496
00:17:52,259 --> 00:17:57,298
hunt or testing keep it scientific make

497
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,548
sure that all of the plants get the same

498
00:17:57,298 --> 00:18:01,859
treatment so we get a reliable outcome

499
00:17:59,548 --> 00:18:03,450
that is my point here so the short

500
00:18:01,859 --> 00:18:05,459
answer is if you are going to top your

501
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:07,110
plants and all of the future runs top

502
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:08,850
your phenol hunters if you plan on

503
00:18:07,109 --> 00:18:11,609
letting them grow that one glory bud

504
00:18:08,849 --> 00:18:14,038
don't top them and see how they go with

505
00:18:11,609 --> 00:18:15,750
that one big glory bud and quickly i'll

506
00:18:14,038 --> 00:18:17,640
tell you how i do phenol hunts and i do

507
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:19,619
them in a couple of different ways if

508
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,759
i'm trying to find a mother plant and i

509
00:18:19,619 --> 00:18:21,449
know that I'm going to keep something

510
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:23,940
around

511
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:25,890
I generally veg in three gallon pots I

512
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:27,750
veg and tell there about just a little

513
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:29,970
bit taller than my knee I'm a tall

514
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:31,769
person I'm six foot five so my knee may

515
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:33,569
be a little bit taller than yours but I

516
00:18:31,769 --> 00:18:35,220
veg until the plants are probably I'm

517
00:18:33,569 --> 00:18:36,450
guessing they're about table high

518
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:38,819
I've veg until they're the height of

519
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:40,500
this table at that point I top them I

520
00:18:38,819 --> 00:18:42,928
take the main top out of the plant and

521
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,980
make a clone from that I generally clean

522
00:18:42,929 --> 00:18:45,840
up the bottoms of the plant

523
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:47,370
just a little bit before flower anyway

524
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:49,048
so I will take two clones off the

525
00:18:47,369 --> 00:18:51,269
bottoms of each plants and I've got

526
00:18:49,048 --> 00:18:53,160
three clones off of every plant so that

527
00:18:51,269 --> 00:18:54,869
if I do find a keeper I've got three

528
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:56,460
opportunities to keep that bad dog

529
00:18:54,869 --> 00:18:58,589
around for future runs

530
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:00,600
so I've edged my original plant to about

531
00:18:58,589 --> 00:19:02,490
knee high I take the top out of it I

532
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:04,439
make a clone from that top I take two

533
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:06,480
bottoms off of it I take two clones from

534
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:08,279
those bottoms now I've got that original

535
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,200
big plant in a three gallon pot now it's

536
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:12,990
about knee-high I've got three clones

537
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:15,419
now we've got a decision to make

538
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:17,940
do we want to flower that big plant or

539
00:19:15,419 --> 00:19:20,160
do we want to flower the clones to find

540
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:22,620
out what we've got there are pros and

541
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,419
cons to both flowering out that big

542
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:26,009
plant it's already fetched out it's

543
00:19:24,419 --> 00:19:27,960
already knee-high it's ready to go

544
00:19:26,009 --> 00:19:30,779
you can flower that bad dog out and you

545
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:32,700
can get a nice amount of flowers off of

546
00:19:30,779 --> 00:19:35,250
that plant and it's already there ready

547
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:37,110
to go or you can fetch out those clones

548
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:39,150
and you can get those clones up to the

549
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:41,308
right size and you can flower those out

550
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:43,590
and those clones will show you what

551
00:19:41,308 --> 00:19:45,569
you've got now if you flower out that

552
00:19:43,589 --> 00:19:48,449
big plant that came from the seed you've

553
00:19:45,569 --> 00:19:50,369
got a really healthy big vigorous mother

554
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:52,470
plant that's been cranking out lots of

555
00:19:50,369 --> 00:19:54,989
branches that is already ready to give

556
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:57,929
you a bunch of clones a lot of people

557
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:59,579
prefer to keep that seed plant the plant

558
00:19:57,929 --> 00:20:02,160
that came from the original seed as

559
00:19:59,579 --> 00:20:04,558
their mother plant many people prefer

560
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:06,240
that as their keeper they keep that one

561
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:09,539
around and take clones from that forever

562
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:11,279
a lot of people will run that big plant

563
00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:13,289
in the flower room and finish it out

564
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:15,119
because like I said earlier it's already

565
00:20:13,289 --> 00:20:17,039
got a lot of growth on it it's ready to

566
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:18,808
go we can flower it at this point why

567
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:21,269
not put that bad dog in the flower room

568
00:20:18,808 --> 00:20:22,980
flip it get some product out of it then

569
00:20:21,269 --> 00:20:24,808
we've got three clones over here in the

570
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:27,509
cloner or in the clone dome it will

571
00:20:24,808 --> 00:20:29,308
become our keepers hopefully one out of

572
00:20:27,509 --> 00:20:31,710
three of those root if you're not good

573
00:20:29,308 --> 00:20:33,629
at cutting clones maybe wait until you

574
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:35,250
see roots on one of your clones before

575
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:37,500
you put that big plant into flower it's

576
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:39,869
only gonna be 14 days you can wait that

577
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:41,640
long hopefully so now you've got three

578
00:20:39,869 --> 00:20:43,500
clones aside you've got a big plant and

579
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,630
flower three of those clones are gonna

580
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:47,220
grow out one the best one out of that

581
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:48,900
will become your new mother plant the

582
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:50,548
other two you can either give them to

583
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:52,740
your friends you can share the genetics

584
00:20:50,548 --> 00:20:54,599
so the genetics don't get lost or you

585
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:56,400
can put those in your bedroom you can

586
00:20:54,599 --> 00:20:57,809
grow them out make them your next flower

587
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,180
run now you've got a mother

588
00:20:57,809 --> 00:21:02,940
and you've got to vegging for your next

589
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:04,950
flower run already if you need to you

590
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:06,539
can cut clones from all three of those

591
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:08,789
to fill up the tray that you need and

592
00:21:06,539 --> 00:21:09,329
then you can have a full room of that

593
00:21:08,789 --> 00:21:12,240
one

594
00:21:09,329 --> 00:21:13,679
select cultivar it's all about planning

595
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,779
it's all about making the decision on

596
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:17,850
which plant you need do you really

597
00:21:15,779 --> 00:21:19,769
prefer to keep that seed plant as your

598
00:21:17,849 --> 00:21:22,649
mother or are you okay with keeping that

599
00:21:19,769 --> 00:21:24,180
best clone as your mother many people in

600
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:26,280
the cannabis world were stuck on the

601
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:28,529
idea of genetic drift I've done a

602
00:21:26,279 --> 00:21:30,389
podcast episode on the way that we have

603
00:21:28,529 --> 00:21:32,099
been using the term genetic drift and

604
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:33,780
what we thought it was that is not

605
00:21:32,099 --> 00:21:35,699
accurate that is not happening in

606
00:21:33,779 --> 00:21:37,950
cannabis so we don't have to worry about

607
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:40,289
genetic drift if we were trying to

608
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:41,789
select a mother from a clone you don't

609
00:21:40,289 --> 00:21:43,440
have to worry about that if your clones

610
00:21:41,789 --> 00:21:45,930
were properly cut if everything was

611
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:48,269
healthy that will not be an issue so I

612
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:50,370
would personally use my clones as my new

613
00:21:48,269 --> 00:21:52,200
mother I would flower out that big plant

614
00:21:50,369 --> 00:21:54,239
since it's already grown as soon as I

615
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:56,340
determine if that big plant is a male or

616
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,079
a female if it's male and I don't need

617
00:21:56,339 --> 00:21:59,669
male plants I would pull that male plant

618
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:01,649
out of the room and get the pot out of

619
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:03,750
the room I would allow more space for

620
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:06,630
those females to grow then I would go

621
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:08,940
and remove those subsequent male clones

622
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:10,830
from the tray remember we cut three

623
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:12,750
clones from each plant so if you remove

624
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:15,210
plant number six you got to go find

625
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:16,740
three clones that are labeled number six

626
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:18,509
all three of those need to come from the

627
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:21,660
dome we don't want those around unless

628
00:22:18,509 --> 00:22:23,670
we do intend to do some breeding so that

629
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:25,410
is how I would do it I think that since

630
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:27,330
we've already veg doubt that big plant

631
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:28,830
let's flower it we don't need to waste

632
00:22:27,329 --> 00:22:30,480
all that time and space getting that

633
00:22:28,829 --> 00:22:32,189
plant that big and then keeping it as a

634
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,319
mother when we can keep a clone as a

635
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:36,120
mother when we don't even know if we've

636
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:38,159
got a plant that we want it could be a

637
00:22:36,119 --> 00:22:40,379
boy it may not even be the phenotype

638
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:41,130
we're looking for so let's flip it let's

639
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:44,130
see what we've got

640
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:45,930
and one more little side rant or ending

641
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:48,060
rant maybe it's a tail rant to add to

642
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:52,019
this I'm going to say this one more time

643
00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:54,389
but always take a clone from every plant

644
00:22:52,019 --> 00:22:56,279
you grow you are going to be very

645
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:58,530
heartbroken if you buy a pack of seeds

646
00:22:56,279 --> 00:23:01,109
you run a pack of seeds and you find a

647
00:22:58,529 --> 00:23:03,629
phenotype from my genetics that I have

648
00:23:01,109 --> 00:23:05,849
never seen before and I am blown away by

649
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:07,890
it and you didn't even take a clone so

650
00:23:05,849 --> 00:23:11,730
before you put your plants into flower

651
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:13,140
please just take one or two clones

652
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:15,269
if you're not really good at cloning

653
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:17,400
make sure those clones have roots before

654
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:21,029
you put your plants into flour so you've

655
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:22,560
got a genetic preserve of that plant if

656
00:23:21,029 --> 00:23:25,019
you grow it out and like I said before

657
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:27,299
maybe it's that one plant that one

658
00:23:25,019 --> 00:23:29,009
specific phenotype that cures an ailment

659
00:23:27,299 --> 00:23:30,539
that has been bugging you for your whole

660
00:23:29,009 --> 00:23:32,640
life and now you could just grow this

661
00:23:30,539 --> 00:23:34,559
one you can roll it up you can smoke it

662
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,960
and now whatever has been bothering you

663
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:39,419
it stops you've got a full hour maybe

664
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:41,069
two hours of relief make sure you have

665
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:42,810
got a clone of that because if you don't

666
00:23:41,069 --> 00:23:45,629
have a clone of that all you're going to

667
00:23:42,809 --> 00:23:46,769
do is be chasing that relief forever

668
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:48,450
you're gonna know what it felt like

669
00:23:46,769 --> 00:23:50,160
you're gonna remember you're gonna try

670
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:52,019
to buy more and more packs of seeds in

671
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:54,000
that and if it's some rare magical

672
00:23:52,019 --> 00:23:56,730
phenotype you may not ever find it again

673
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,759
we try to breed reliable repeatable

674
00:23:56,730 --> 00:24:01,650
phenotypes but this is genetics you're

675
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:04,170
going to find outliers and if you find

676
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:05,820
that amazing outlier I can't promise you

677
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:08,640
it will pop up in a pack of seeds again

678
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:10,409
so the short version of that long ramble

679
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:14,490
which I will blame on the Malibu pure

680
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:17,430
Kush is always take a clone of every

681
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:19,589
seed you sprout before you put it into

682
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:21,539
flour because you never know if you've

683
00:24:19,589 --> 00:24:24,209
got the next you might have the next

684
00:24:21,539 --> 00:24:26,009
Girl Scout cookies or the next tangi or

685
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:27,360
you could have the next Gorilla Glue or

686
00:24:26,009 --> 00:24:29,160
whatever is popular today in the next

687
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:29,639
gelato you could have the next wedding

688
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,500
cake

689
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:33,270
you may have the next hitter sitting

690
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:35,640
right there in your grow room and you

691
00:24:33,269 --> 00:24:37,619
didn't take a clone of it now if you do

692
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:39,690
fail to take clones we can always

693
00:24:37,619 --> 00:24:42,000
revenge I think I've done a revenge

694
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:44,730
episode before if not I will put one

695
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,519
together so we can talk about revenge

696
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:49,860
Keeper plants just in case we did not

697
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:51,900
get a clone all right Scott I think I'm

698
00:24:49,859 --> 00:24:53,339
more than answered your question I want

00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:55,019
day at a boring job that means a lot to

732
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:57,240
us and while you're sitting there at

733
00:25:55,019 --> 00:25:59,579
work you are getting paid to become a

734
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,359
better ganja grower so I appreciate that

735
00:25:59,579 --> 00:26:02,939
man thank you

736
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:04,439
so the message keeps going it says I

737
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:06,480
have a quick question which I haven't

738
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:09,809
heard you address in your podcast yet

739
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:12,990
unless I have missed it I am running

740
00:26:09,809 --> 00:26:15,569
feminised seeds from a reputable breeder

741
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:17,849
sadly they are not I read genetics but I

742
00:26:15,569 --> 00:26:19,950
recently scored a 6-pack of lemon

743
00:26:17,849 --> 00:26:21,709
Jeffrey and golden goat so I will be

744
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:24,000
getting I read in the future runs

745
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:26,190
alright so just to be clear this guy is

746
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,500
growing some feminized seeds from a

747
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:31,380
reputable breeder which is not I read

748
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:33,809
genetics but he's got some Irie on deck

749
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:36,630
for the future now the message goes on

750
00:26:33,809 --> 00:26:38,789
to say I just went into the garden and

751
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:41,520
one of my feminized plants which has

752
00:26:38,789 --> 00:26:44,609
grown from seed has a few branches that

753
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:47,160
showed sex within a day or two and have

754
00:26:44,609 --> 00:26:51,149
pre flowers while I have my lights on an

755
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:53,070
18-6 veg cycle what are the possible

756
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:54,840
causes and what should I do with this

757
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:57,450
plant have you ever experienced this

758
00:26:54,839 --> 00:26:58,289
much love from Michigan State I read

759
00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:00,509
some

760
00:26:58,289 --> 00:27:03,089
Brendon all right Brendan I think I have

761
00:27:00,509 --> 00:27:06,299
a couple of ideas what could be going on

762
00:27:03,089 --> 00:27:09,059
in your garden all right so Brendan has

763
00:27:06,299 --> 00:27:11,849
got some feminized seeds in his garden

764
00:27:09,059 --> 00:27:14,490
they are on an 18-6 light cycle which

765
00:27:11,849 --> 00:27:16,459
means they should be continuing to veg

766
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:18,480
they should not be flowering

767
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:21,090
unfortunately he has discovered that a

768
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:23,610
couple of branches have showed sex and

769
00:27:21,089 --> 00:27:25,139
pre flowers while these plants are still

770
00:27:23,609 --> 00:27:27,479
on the 18:6

771
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:29,640
light cycle so he is curious what

772
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:32,880
possible causes could have caused this

773
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:35,820
and what to do with the plant now I

774
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:37,740
really wish I knew how long these plants

775
00:27:35,819 --> 00:27:38,579
had been vegging I really wish I knew

776
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:40,528
how much

777
00:27:38,579 --> 00:27:42,538
white these plants were getting and what

778
00:27:40,528 --> 00:27:45,298
type of light they were getting I also

779
00:27:42,538 --> 00:27:48,119
really wish I knew what size container

780
00:27:45,298 --> 00:27:50,429
and what type of soilless mix or cocoa

781
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:53,250
or soil you were working with and also

782
00:27:50,429 --> 00:27:55,559
what they have been getting fed but

783
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:58,140
without that information I can give you

784
00:27:55,558 --> 00:28:00,960
a few ideas of what could be happening

785
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:04,440
the number one guess you may have Auto

786
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:06,960
flours I cannot support or denied that

787
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:09,990
claim in any way but they are flowering

788
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:12,028
under an 18-6 light cycle makes me think

789
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:14,069
maybe auto flours

790
00:28:12,028 --> 00:28:16,200
I think the only way to determine if

791
00:28:14,069 --> 00:28:18,629
they are actually Auto flours is to keep

792
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:20,548
an eye on them are they actually going

793
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:22,590
into full flower or is that just a

794
00:28:20,548 --> 00:28:24,629
little bit of a tease is a little bit of

795
00:28:22,589 --> 00:28:27,959
a pre flower are they giving you signs

796
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:29,940
because earlier I said I wondered how

797
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:31,649
much light they were getting are they

798
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:34,230
getting enough light yes you've got them

799
00:28:31,648 --> 00:28:36,268
on an 18-6 light cycle but if you've got

800
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:38,278
too many plants crowded in and they're

801
00:28:36,269 --> 00:28:39,569
not getting enough actual light on their

802
00:28:38,278 --> 00:28:42,148
leaves they're not absorbing enough

803
00:28:39,569 --> 00:28:44,009
light the amount of hours which that

804
00:28:42,148 --> 00:28:45,359
grow light is on in your grow room won't

805
00:28:44,009 --> 00:28:47,129
make a difference if the plants are

806
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:49,019
being shaded by other plants if they're

807
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:50,610
pressed in too closely together or if

808
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:52,798
they're just simply too far from the

809
00:28:50,609 --> 00:28:54,298
light source so if they think they are

810
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:57,089
not getting enough light if they're not

811
00:28:54,298 --> 00:29:00,089
reaching their daily light integral they

812
00:28:57,089 --> 00:29:02,009
will begin to flower simply because

813
00:29:00,089 --> 00:29:03,928
they're not getting enough light energy

814
00:29:02,009 --> 00:29:06,359
and they think that the end of the world

815
00:29:03,929 --> 00:29:08,610
the end of the season is coming so

816
00:29:06,359 --> 00:29:11,609
another reason that these plants may

817
00:29:08,609 --> 00:29:14,219
begin to flower on you is because they

818
00:29:11,609 --> 00:29:16,229
may be root bound what size pot are they

819
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:18,480
in how long have they been in that pot

820
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:19,829
if those roots are trying to grow and

821
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,329
they don't have anywhere to go they're

822
00:29:19,829 --> 00:29:24,178
all bound up they're all twisted around

823
00:29:21,329 --> 00:29:26,369
in that pot that plant is gonna say [ __ ]

824
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:28,559
it I got nothing left to do but flower

825
00:29:26,369 --> 00:29:30,778
I've only got a few weeks left in this

826
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:32,548
pot before it's gonna be terrible your

827
00:29:30,778 --> 00:29:34,798
plants may be stuck wearing shoes that

828
00:29:32,548 --> 00:29:36,929
are way too small and they may be angry

829
00:29:34,798 --> 00:29:38,668
about it and they just want bigger shoes

830
00:29:36,929 --> 00:29:41,190
and until you give them bigger shoes

831
00:29:38,669 --> 00:29:42,480
they're going to flower imagine if one

832
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:44,340
day when you were like seven or eight

833
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,288
years old I put some shoes on you I

834
00:29:44,339 --> 00:29:48,000
laced them up real nice I was like those

835
00:29:46,288 --> 00:29:49,769
are your shoes buddy and now you got to

836
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,450
live your whole life in those shoes now

837
00:29:49,769 --> 00:29:52,450
that you're a grown-ass adult those

838
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:54,309
little kid shoe

839
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:56,410
are gonna be so super tight and so

840
00:29:54,309 --> 00:29:58,539
uncomfortable that plant has lived its

841
00:29:56,410 --> 00:30:00,040
entire life in that container and it may

842
00:29:58,539 --> 00:30:01,960
be root bound it may be really

843
00:30:00,039 --> 00:30:04,149
uncomfortable its toes are cramped it

844
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:06,370
has no choice but to flower now just

845
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:08,050
because that's its final survival

846
00:30:06,369 --> 00:30:09,939
instinct it's like this is what I know

847
00:30:08,049 --> 00:30:13,659
how to do this was my entire goal in

848
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:16,509
life a cannabis plants main goal is to

849
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:18,850
reproduce and make more seed for the

850
00:30:16,509 --> 00:30:20,920
next season that's its main goal and it

851
00:30:18,849 --> 00:30:22,629
does that by going into flower the male

852
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:24,250
plants get taller than the other plants

853
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:26,020
so they could drop their pollen down on

854
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:27,609
the females the females get white and

855
00:30:26,019 --> 00:30:29,230
bushy so they can make a lot of bud

856
00:30:27,609 --> 00:30:31,059
sites a lot of pistols they can receive

857
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:33,309
a lot of pollen they can get pollinated

858
00:30:31,059 --> 00:30:35,919
they can drop seeds for the future the

859
00:30:33,309 --> 00:30:38,079
cannabis plants main goal is to receive

860
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:40,180
pollen it cannot do that until it goes

861
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:42,099
into flower so when you stress it you

862
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:44,289
piss it off it goes this is what I'm

863
00:30:42,099 --> 00:30:46,569
gonna do I'm going to flower because I

864
00:30:44,289 --> 00:30:48,460
need to get out of this situation the

865
00:30:46,569 --> 00:30:50,439
only way I can do that is the flower

866
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:52,000
then they'll cut me down and smoke me or

867
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:54,779
I get to make seeds for the next

868
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:57,759
generation now there are also some

869
00:30:54,779 --> 00:31:00,039
nutrients and things you could spray or

870
00:30:57,759 --> 00:31:01,629
feed to your plants which may trigger

871
00:31:00,039 --> 00:31:03,849
them to flower I've talked about some

872
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:05,200
products I know that advance nutrients

873
00:31:03,849 --> 00:31:07,059
used to sell up but ignitor

874
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,830
if you accidentally fed that to your veg

875
00:31:07,059 --> 00:31:10,450
plants they would be in flower next week

876
00:31:08,829 --> 00:31:12,339
you couldn't do anything about it you

877
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:15,309
fed them but ignitor they're switching

878
00:31:12,339 --> 00:31:17,289
get ready go so there are products that

879
00:31:15,309 --> 00:31:19,419
if you accidentally feed those will

880
00:31:17,289 --> 00:31:21,250
possibly potentially make your plants

881
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:22,960
flip too early if your plants are

882
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:24,579
stressed if they're not getting fed

883
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:26,829
enough if they're getting fed too much

884
00:31:24,579 --> 00:31:29,589
if there are more than one or two

885
00:31:26,829 --> 00:31:31,990
stressors on a plant it can make that

886
00:31:29,589 --> 00:31:34,509
plant pre flower I really think your

887
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:36,700
plant is probably root bound or you

888
00:31:34,509 --> 00:31:39,220
possibly don't have enough light or the

889
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:41,620
worst case scenario is you ended up with

890
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:43,630
some accidental auto flower seeds

891
00:31:41,619 --> 00:31:45,219
