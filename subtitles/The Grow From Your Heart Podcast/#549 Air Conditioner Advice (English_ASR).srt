28
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:59,439
giving a giant thank you shout out to my

29
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,879
buddy thanks for nothing for the perfect

30
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:02,960
podcast intro track

31
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:04,239
thank you bro that fits very well and i

32
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,840
appreciate your work

33
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,520
all right this is the point of the show

34
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,159
where i talk about what i'm smoking

35
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:11,200
today i've been taking ridiculous dabs

36
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,040
of holy [ __ ]

37
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,799
full spectrum extract from green dot

38
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,360
labs this is a blend of

39
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:19,439
sex on the beach and halo on the package

40
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:20,319
the flavor is described as pina colada

41
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:22,158
and fuel

42
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:23,599
that is a very unique description but

43
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,439
i'm going to agree

44
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:27,199
when you inhale there's a fruitiness

45
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:28,239
that pina colada coconut kind of

46
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,560
pineapple taste

47
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:31,679
that tropical flavor overwhelms my mouth

48
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,439
then on the exhale

49
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,759
my tongue goes dry and it tastes like

50
00:01:33,438 --> 00:01:38,239
fruity fuel so i completely agree with

51
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,640
the pina colada and fuel flavor on the

52
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:43,438
back of the package it says the thc

53
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:46,640
level is 59.29 percent

54
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:48,000
and non-detectable amounts of cbd

55
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,840
big shout out to our friends at green

56
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,959
dot labs for the delicious

57
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,399
holy [ __ ] full spectrum extract and

58
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:56,959
speaking of holy [ __ ]

59
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,840
holy [ __ ] you guys it is super hot today

60
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:59,599

61
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,200
day that we have experienced here in

62
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:03,839
southern colorado this summer

63
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,719
and i am feeling it that has led up to a

64
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,880
bunch of great

65
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:08,399

never stops it's always evolving

169
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,160
if you think you're gonna do it uh know

170
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:16,000
that it's going to be a lifestyle not

171
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,560
just a job not just a hobby

172
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,199
um let's see growing growing is what i

173
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,720
have to do

174
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,400
if i didn't grow none of this would work

175
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,160
growing is uh growing and playing the

176
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:25,120
drums are two things that i have to do

177
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,240
if i didn't do those

178
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,680
something would go wrong with me

179
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,478
mentally and physically a screw would

180
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,840
come undone

181
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:32,079
springs would pop out somewhere it would

182
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:34,319
just be terrible uh breeding

183
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:35,279
i love to breed i love making new seeds

184
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:36,879
and growing them

185
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:38,319
and then i love seeing you guys have

186
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:39,600

187
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:40,639
things i breed so that's awesome

188
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,280
consulting

189
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:45,280
um i love going to big grows it keeps me

190
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:46,638
up to speed it keeps me up to tech i get

191
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:48,079
to see what all these other people

192
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,160
bought and then i get to play with it

193
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:52,000
learn how to make it work owners get

194
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,520
these big ideas somebody told them to

195
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,399
buy some crazy [ __ ] so they bought it

196
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,680
because they had money

197
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:57,359
and the investor was like we don't know

198
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,400
what we need so they bought it the

199
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,680
person that told them to buy it

200
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:01,359
disappeared it was just some

201
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,639
[ __ ] dude they knew and they need

202
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,319
somebody to work it so they call me and

203
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,360
i get to go play with so many great toys

204
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,240

or a 12 by 20 flower room in a basement

268
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:50,878
with heating and cooling vented in

269
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,879
however

270
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:55,039
over the past couple of weeks [ __ ] has

271

house uh the house ac isn't cooling the

273
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:01,199

274
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,720
i feel your pain it is ah it's 10

275
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,199
o'clock at night as i'm recording and it

276
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,440
is still 91 degrees outside

277
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,360
so i'm sweating it's hot i've had the

278
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:11,199
cooler on all day it is finally

279
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,360
uh cool in here it hasn't been cool

280
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,199
until right about now at 10 o'clock so

281
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,879
i feel your pain it's hot the whole

282
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,879
country is getting hot right now

283
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:21,199
um you're running six to eight plants

284
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:24,400
under four hlg 550s

285
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:26,639
and two best of a 2000 watt reflector

286
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:27,519
series budget purples uh to vary the

287
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,840
spectrum

288
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:32,240
and even though i run my lights at night

289
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:34,158
uh from 5 pm to 5 am with it being in

290
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,000
the mid 90s every day temps are raising

291
00:08:34,158 --> 00:08:38,000
between 85 and 88

292
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,679
even with my hurricane 20 inch pro

293
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,399
velocity fan on them and the

294
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:44,079
dehumidifier set to 60

295
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,759
all right so it's getting hot in there

296
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,160
um she told us what kind of light she's

297
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:50,879
got we know what size the space is

298
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:53,519
um she's got the right idea running the

299
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:55,039
lights from 5 pm to 5 a.m

300
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,639
it's cooler at that point you don't have

301
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:57,199
to fight the sun it's easier to cool the

302
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:59,360
grow room

303
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,800
also electricity is cheaper many

304
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,320
electrical companies will charge you a

305
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:04,000
premium price for the electric during

306
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,600
the day because everybody's functioning

307
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,440
all the businesses need power

308
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,879
it is cheaper at night so you're off to

309
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,080
a good start

310
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:13,360
the hurricane 20 inch pro fan uh guys

311
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,839
here's a note you need to keep in your

312
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,159
brain

313
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:18,480
fans do not create cool air they move

314
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:20,000
the air around they circulate air

315
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,440
if it's getting too hot from a heat

316
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,559
source you need something to battle the

317
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,480
heat source

318
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:26,000
the fan doesn't battle it it moves it

319
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,839
around it makes it comfortable

320
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,120
you need something to fight the heat if

321
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,080
you're making heat you need something to

322
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,399
make cool

323
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:35,040
so here we are at this point we have got

324
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:37,519
58 to or 85 to 88 degrees

325
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:38,719
uh 60 humidity it says i'm afraid my

326
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,679
girls are going to get

327
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,480
very unhappy soon if this continues so i

328
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:44,958
have purchased a winter it's

329
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,399
w-h-y-n-t-e-r that's

330
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:48,479
said winter if you guys have seen those

i get it right the first time we don't

387
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,079
have to keep overdoing it one solution

388
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,639
was to remove

389
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:32,399
the window replace a piece of plywood

390
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:33,759
pre-cut for the hoses okay you are on

391
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,200
the right path let's just start talking

392
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:38,480
about how i would do this

393
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:40,399
i have got a very similar window set up

394
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,959
with a very similar air conditioner in

395
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,919
the window i did not use plywood i opted

396
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:45,359
to use

397
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:47,039
i'm not sure what it's supposed to be

398
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,919
for i am not a construction guy i'm not

399
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,759
a handyman

400
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:51,278
ah that is not my realm i'll admit that

401
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:52,879
[ __ ] you're not good at hvac i don't

402
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:55,360
know what the [ __ ] at lowe's is called

403
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:56,000
i point and grunt we get what we need uh

404
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,560
i use

405
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,919
some blue insulation board it's blue

406
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:01,518
it's foam it looks like it's for

407
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:03,039
insulation i think it's got a diamond

408
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,919
shape and it may say dupont in the

409
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:06,000
middle of it

410
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:07,759
uh i don't get the one with the silver

411
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,519
reflective on either side they offer it

412
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:10,240
with the silver reflective i do not buy

413
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:12,480
that

414
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,320
by the foam board i think it is one and

415
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,680
a half to two inches thick they make it

416
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,480
in different thicknesses

417
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:20,559
in my basement window the window well is

418
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,240
quite wide it's as wide as the basement

419
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:22,719
foundation as wide as the house was

420
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,120
built

421
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,800
so i can press i take out the window i

422
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,480
took it the glass and the frame are gone

423
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:30,000
they simply popped out of the [ __ ]

424
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,480
the square where the window goes

425
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,240
i popped that out i cut a square of that

426
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,000
blue foam insulation and i popped it in

427
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,720
there as tight as it would go

428
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,200
then i used gorilla [ __ ] it's a spray

429
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,720
foam

430
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,000
you can put it you're going to ruin your

431
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,600
clothes wear some clothes you can

432
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
destroy wear some gloves tie up your

433
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,759
hair

434
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,919
if you got dreadlocks get that [ __ ] out

435
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:48,639
of the way the gorilla [ __ ] is a mess

436
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:50,399
and it gets

437
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,000
everywhere it is hard to clean up it's a

438
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,519
pain in the ass karen saw photos

439
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,519
of the area where i applied the gorilla

440
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,959
[ __ ] all that spattery stuff

441
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,639
that's what i could not clean up it

442
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:59,439
sucks to work with be more careful than

443
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,519
i was

444
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,560
seal all the way around that window with

445
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,720
the gorilla [ __ ]

446
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:06,399
then make multiple layers of duct tape

447
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,920
over it uh don't do the duct tape yet

448
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:10,639
we're gonna do that next

449
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:11,278
uh but seal it with duct tape then take

450
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:14,159
your

451
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:16,000
ducts from the air conditioner and trace

452
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:18,240
the size of the hole and make a hole

453
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,399
and cut that hole out now what i choose

454
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,879
to do is i went to the grow store

455
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,480
and the ducks i am using are six inches

456
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:26,559
in diameter the air conditioner i

457
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:29,120
purchased has a six inch duct

458
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:30,719
i grabbed a six inch metal flange it's

459
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,639
just a piece about this long and it's

460
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,000
sick i'm holding up my hands probably 10

461
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,399
or 11 inches

462
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,240
maybe 12 inches long just a piece of

463
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,958
sheet metal ducting wrapped into a duct

464
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,278
it's

465
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:42,159
six inches in diameter and 10 to 12

466
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:45,759
inches long

467
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:47,278
and i push that through the foam board i

468
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:49,039
measure it cut a hole push that through

469
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:49,759
the foam board tape that securely into

470
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:51,679
place

471
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:53,360
the foam board is taped into the wall

472
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:55,120
also held in with gorilla [ __ ]

473
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,879
then i put the metal in there then i

474
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,759
attached the ducting to the metal just

475
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:59,759
to give it something

476
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:01,360
to attach to something strong to support

477
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:03,039
on then i duct tape

478
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,399
the [ __ ] out of it i want to catch up

479
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:08,159
into your message and see where we

480
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:09,919
are um i've kind of lost my spot

481
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:12,000
uh window replaced with a piece of

482
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:13,759
plywood pre-cut for the hoses

483
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,440
um yes you can do that you can pre-cut

484
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:16,879
or you can post cut it was easier for me

485
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,720
to cut once it was up there

486
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:20,399
i just hang the thing and measure it was

487
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,000
easy but cut it as you need

488
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,440
uh then you want to screw the window

489
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,958
into the frame and caulk it

490
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,600
that would work i use the foam

491
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:29,439
insulation because it's easier to cut

492
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,959
uh and it's uh it's insulated it's

493
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,720
already insulated

494
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:34,719
but the good part about the wood is it's

495
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,399
going to be light proof i have to duct

496
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,519
tape the inside of my room to make sure

497
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:40,559
no light comes through

498
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:42,639
when i use this so where are we here

499
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:44,638
uh cocked but how do i filter it to

500
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:47,198
ensure bugs and or light can't get

501
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:48,320
through the intake or outtake hoses that

502
00:14:47,198 --> 00:14:50,799
is a very

503
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,920
good question and a very good challenge

504
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:55,278
one of those hoses

505
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:57,198
spits out heat um i usually put

506
00:14:55,278 --> 00:14:59,120
black pantyhose over the end of that

507
00:14:57,198 --> 00:15:00,479
just put pantyhose just like a condom

508
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,919
and duct tape it in place

509
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,360
it'll blow and you'll see that flap in

510
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:04,799
the wind a little bit but the pantyhose

511
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:08,320
prevents anything from coming in

512
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:11,759
put it on both sides i do not use

513
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:13,120
the um the duct in i only use the duct

514
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:14,399
out that way i'm not pulling the air

515
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,078
from outside

516
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,278
it makes the air conditioner struggle a

517
00:15:16,078 --> 00:15:18,879
little bit because you're using that

518
00:15:17,278 --> 00:15:21,679
humidity in the room

519
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:24,240
but when it's 120 outside and it's only

520
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:25,838
85 in my room i feel it's easier

521
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,120
for the air conditioner to use that air

522
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:28,480
that's already in the room and then it

523
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,240
just blows the heat out it's less

524
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,360
circulation and cycling going through my

525
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,759
machine

526
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,519
less ducting that i've got i don't use

527
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:37,278
that second hose i just leave it open

528
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:39,278
and i put a filter over that

529
00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:41,120
so a pantyhose is the cheap way to do

530
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:42,559
that uh if you're confident that it's

531
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,919
not going to heat up enough to cause a

532
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:45,919
problem on the pantyhose by the time it

533
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:47,360
gets down that far it should be okay

534
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:49,120
but make sure you put your hand over and

535
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,320
check so that's how i filter it

536
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,959
pantyhose that is

537
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,959
super high tech um it's really cost

538
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:57,679
effective that's a million dollar trick

539
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:59,198
pantyhose bro uh where are we or ma'am

540
00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:00,479
sorry i shouldn't call you bro you're

541
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:02,240
one of the bros by now oh

542
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,000
you're one of us come hang out one of

543
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,639
the grow bros nothing but respect either

544
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,278
way

545
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:08,480
um i don't want to say this out loud but

546
00:16:07,278 --> 00:16:09,919
mites are

547
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,839
the only grower problem i haven't dealt

548
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:13,039
with well uh you'll get mites eventually

549
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:14,800
where else are we on this

550
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:16,480
and how do i go about this smell venting

551
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:18,479
out and blasting the intake out of the

552
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:21,440
hoses

553
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,360
i do not think it cycles much air from

554
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,560
your room you've got the two hose models

555
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,320
so you are going to be pulling

556
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:28,078
air in through that it's going to go

557
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,199
over the compressor and out you may need

558
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:30,719
to use both hoses

559
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:32,639
and then it creates a loop and that air

560
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,079
doesn't touch or grow you aren't pulling

561
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:35,600
air from the grow and pushing it out

562
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:37,519
you're just pulling out it's a loop

563
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,440
and that should work for you i can't

564
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:40,078
make any promises that way use the two

565
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,759
hoses

566
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:43,439
and you create a continuous loop and the

567
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,959
air doesn't get sucked from your grow

568
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,839
the odor doesn't get sucked and blown

569
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:48,078
out

570
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,680
you may need another carbon filter in

571
00:16:48,078 --> 00:16:50,799
the grow room just put a carbon filter

572
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:52,638
with a blower in it

573
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:54,559
right in front of the air conditioner uh

574
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,079
that'll help stir the air around also

575
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:57,039
that'll suck out a bunch of aroma and

576
00:16:56,078 --> 00:16:58,799
odors

577
00:16:57,039 --> 00:17:00,399
but if you do the loop i don't think

578
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:02,240
you're going to get much aroma

579
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:04,000
where i am i don't worry too much about

580
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,959
aroma the neighbors know who i am by

581
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,558
now goes on to say i've emailed you a

582
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,480
few pics i did check out the emails and

583
00:17:08,558 --> 00:17:12,078
i did reply i'm sorry for holding the

584
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,038
email paper in front of the camera

585
00:17:12,078 --> 00:17:14,159
that's rudolph wasn't paying any

586
00:17:13,038 --> 00:17:15,199
attention if you're watching the video i

587
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,199
do apologize

588
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,720
trying to be a better podcaster i did

589
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:20,240
check out the photos i did reply with

590
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,759
the video i was kind enough to make a

591
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,199
quick video of myspace

592
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:24,959
and show that to you i hope it helped

593
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,558
out then it says mites are the only

594
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,880
problem i haven't dealt with over the

595
00:17:26,558 --> 00:17:31,119
years and i don't want to have to

596
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,160
uh the way to not deal with mites is to

597
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:34,399
have a

598
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,919
solid integrated pest management system

599
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,759
have some sort of security so that those

600
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:39,200
mites cannot arrive don't allow them to

601
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:41,839
even show their faces

602
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,279
either sprays or predators however you

603
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:45,759
choose to do it

604
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:47,119
in your message you were concerned that

605
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:48,240
maybe they'll come in the cracks it

606
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:49,759
feels like maybe they'll come in those

607
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,480
little holes where you just hung up that

608
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:51,679
board

609
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,200
they're going to come in through the

610
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,320
miniature cracks in the walls in your

611
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,000
house anyway they're

612
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:57,200
if they're there they're coming in uh

613
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,079
just make sure you've got a pest

614
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,319
management

615
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:02,319
system um another good point you bring

616
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:04,000
up is also with a unit on the floor the

617
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:05,038
hoses don't quite reach without being

618
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,279
fully stretched

619
00:18:05,038 --> 00:18:08,798
well i need additional six inch venting

620
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:10,240
or five inch they're using five inch on

621
00:18:08,798 --> 00:18:11,759
that one different model than i've got

622
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,200
so the hoses are working properly or

623
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:14,400
would it be better to prop it up on

624
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,400
cement blocks

625
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,480
that is a very good question i love the

626
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,960
way you think i've got mine

627
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,079
raised up on three cinder blocks i've

628
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,240
got it up kind of high

629
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:26,159
the heat blows at the canopy are the air

630
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,599
the cool blows at the canopy of my

631
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,360
plants right across the top it kind of

632
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:31,119
goes between the lights and the canopy

633
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:33,119
that's where the hottest part is it just

634
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:35,359
pushes that heat right away

635
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:37,119
also up on the buckets i am allowed to

636
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:39,119
these air conditioners will create

637
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:39,839
condensation and runoff there's a drain

638
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:42,000
in the back

639
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:43,918
it will pee a little bit occasionally

640
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,720
run that tube into a bucket between

641
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,080
those uh

642
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,440
cinder blocks that you've got it raised

643
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:48,960
up on or however you raise it cinder

644
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,360
blocks are my recommendation

645
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,558
i probably weighs about 130 pounds so be

646
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:54,639
careful lifting it up make sure it

647
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:57,759
doesn't roll off of there

648
00:18:54,640 --> 00:19:01,280
i put duct tape flaps on the wheels

649
00:18:57,759 --> 00:19:03,359
uh the cooler is sitting on four cinder

650
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:05,839
blocks uh is it four is it two

651
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:07,279
uh it's two there's it's only this wide

652
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:08,240
so there's two cinder blocks are stacked

653
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:09,839
up three high

654
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,359
but i took just little mounds i made

655
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:12,240
speed bumps out of duct tape on the

656
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:14,639
cinder blocks

657
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,519
so that the thing cannot roll also the

658
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,799
wheels pivot

659
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:18,639
so i turned it to where the wheels are

660
00:19:16,798 --> 00:19:20,480
facing different directions so that it

661
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,720
doesn't have an easy way to turn

662
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,558
just be safe be careful it weighs 130

663
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,679
pounds it could fall on you it could

664
00:19:24,558 --> 00:19:27,678
fall on your plants

665
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:29,360
when it falls that ducting that it's

666
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,960
attached to is going to yank the window

667
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:32,399
cover off and now everybody can see

668
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,000
right into your grow room if the lights

669
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,600
are on if it's hot outside

670
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,038
everyone's seeing your grow lights

671
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:38,319
they're seeing your grow room

672
00:19:37,038 --> 00:19:39,839
make sure that [ __ ] thing doesn't

673
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:41,759
fall but yes do raise it up off the

674
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:43,519
ground it's going to make condensation

675
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:45,279
hopefully it came with the drain tube if

676
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:47,279
not it's got a little spout in the back

677
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:48,399
lift up the cover on that i just leave

678
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:49,759
it uncovered all the time

679
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,679
mine's got a tube that hangs into a

680
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:54,079
bucket uh fills up about

681
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:55,600
five gallons maybe every week or so i

682
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:57,119
never let it get full because i can see

683
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:59,279
it when i go in the room

684
00:19:57,119 --> 00:20:00,879
just dump it occasionally a lot of

685
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:01,759
people say you can use that water to

686
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,080
water your plants

687
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:05,119
i don't like that there could be [ __ ] in

688
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:07,359
there there could not

689
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:09,038
but there could be [ __ ] in there let's

690

under the house

825
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,640
all right so you're pulling from the uh

826
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:53,839
outside the grow area

827
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,000
and then it's going through the grow

828
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:57,839
space and then under the house

829
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,519
i'm really only worried about cooling

830
00:23:57,839 --> 00:24:01,119
the flower room

831
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:02,960
uh then it says the bedroom doesn't

832
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:04,558
matter so much yes it does that's the

833
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,079
first correction i'm gonna make

834
00:24:04,558 --> 00:24:08,240
i don't know how hot your flower room

835
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:08,720
your bedroom is getting but so many

836
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,480
people

837
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,000
overlook the importance of building a

838
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,240
quality veg room

839
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,519
that their grow is not as successful as

840
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:19,038
it could be

841
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:21,038
your veg room is equally as important

842
00:24:19,038 --> 00:24:22,240
if not more important than your

843
00:24:21,038 --> 00:24:24,158
flowering room

844
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,759
without a proper veg cycle your plants

845
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:27,679
will be weak and spindly

846
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:30,000
and not prepared for a proper flowering

847
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:30,798
cycle i'm not saying that monsoon moon

848
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,720
420

849
00:24:30,798 --> 00:24:34,079
is doing anything wrong they may have a

850
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,759
perfect set up they don't need to make

851
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:36,879
any adjustments i want to make sure that

852
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:40,480
everybody knows

853
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:41,120
that veg is very important i often see

854
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,679
people

855
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:44,798
invest a lot of money in the flower room

856
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:46,400
and then i'm like cool let me see your

857
00:24:44,798 --> 00:24:47,038
veg space and like oh i bought a five by

858
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,798
five tent

859
00:24:47,038 --> 00:24:50,798
and i'm like so you spent thousands of

860
00:24:48,798 --> 00:24:52,558
dollars on this fancy flower room

861
00:24:50,798 --> 00:24:54,079
and you're gonna start everything off in

862
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:57,359
a five by five tent

863
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:57,918
okay that's that's cool but i think you

864
00:24:57,359 --> 00:25:00,158
should have

865
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:01,679
veg is the foundation that is the start

866
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:02,880
you want the best lights the best

867
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:05,360
ventilation the best

868
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,400
co2 you want all of the best in veg

869
00:25:05,359 --> 00:25:07,759
that's like training

870
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,440
you want to train the best you can

871
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:11,038
before you go into battle and battle is

872
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,558
the flower phase

873
00:25:11,038 --> 00:25:14,400
i want them tough i want them strong i

874
00:25:12,558 --> 00:25:16,158
want them prepared i want them to

875
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,159
be ready to flower and give me what i

876
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:19,120
need before i put them into flour so i

877
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:21,840
think veg

878
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:22,239
is just as important and that matters as

879
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:24,480
much

880
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,000
if not more uh so i don't know if you've

881
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,960
already got a dialed in veg space and it

882
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,278
doesn't matter that you

883
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:31,200
upgrade it but i want to make sure that

884
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:31,599
you understand it does matter as much

885
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,200
now

886
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:35,678
let me keep going it says do you think

887
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:37,759
it's better to have the head of the ac

888
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:39,360
inside the flower room or outside of the

889
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:42,558
flower room blowing near

890
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:44,079
an intake all right so you've got your

891
00:25:42,558 --> 00:25:46,879
veg space in your flower space

892
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:48,399
inside of this bedroom you're bringing

893
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:51,278
air into the tents

894
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,640
if you put the head of your mini split

895
00:25:51,278 --> 00:25:54,720
inside the room

896
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,000
you cannot have different temperatures

897
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,839
in your veg tent

898
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,119
and in your flowering tent because

899
00:25:57,839 --> 00:26:01,439
you're cooling the room

900
00:25:59,119 --> 00:26:03,599
and sucking that air into the tents so

901
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,360
whatever temperature you get the room in

902
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:06,798
the middle we call that a lung room

903
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:09,119
whatever that lung room

904
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:10,000
is temperature to that's what

905
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:12,479
temperature is going

906
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,359
to go into your flower and your veg

907
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,400
spaces

908
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:18,319
if you put the head of your mini split

909
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,200
inside the flower space you can dial in

910
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:21,278
the temperature

911
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,880
in the flower room you've got a mini

912
00:26:21,278 --> 00:26:24,000
split you should have two heads right

913
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,919
can't you put one in

914
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,440
each i'm not sure what unit you bought

915
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:29,038
many of them have two heads that's why

916
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,759
it's a split split over here split it

917
00:26:29,038 --> 00:26:31,200
over here

918
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:32,558
or is it a split because the heads

919
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,519
outside are in here and the units

920
00:26:32,558 --> 00:26:37,038
outside i don't know

921
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:38,240
like i said bro not an hvac guy but um

922
00:26:37,038 --> 00:26:39,519
so that is your main thing to think

923
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,440
about do you want to climb and control

924
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:42,798
the room and move that air into both of

925
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,640
the tents or do you want the

926
00:26:42,798 --> 00:26:46,079
flowering room to get the focus of the

927
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,320
air conditioner

928
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:49,918
then it goes on to say if i go ahead and

929
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:51,359
install it straight into the flower room

930
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:54,799
will i still need to use my

931
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:55,918
intake or exhausts um yes because you

932
00:26:54,798 --> 00:26:59,278
are not replacing

933
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:00,960
the fresh air the co2 the humidity

934
00:26:59,278 --> 00:27:01,679
there's no airflow because of that you

935
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,360
still need

936
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:06,080
unless you seal up the room and

937
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:08,319
supplement co2 you do still need exhaust

938
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:10,399
and intake because you'll stifle the co2

939
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:11,918
and oxygen in that room

940
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,679
if you're running co2 and you've got

941
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:15,600
enough co2 to supplement to keep those

942
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:17,200
plants happy you can seal it up and not

943
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:18,798
use those intakes but

944
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,360
if you don't have supplemental co2 in

945
00:27:18,798 --> 00:27:22,879
there and i mean like 14 to 1600 ppm if

946
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:25,199
you're not supplementing high

947
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,480
don't seal it up and do keep using the

948
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,558
intakes and outs

949
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:31,440
uh what i need to exhaust the smell out

950
00:27:28,558 --> 00:27:33,038
of the room at certain intervals

951
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,798
i hope you've got a carbon filter hooked

952
00:27:33,038 --> 00:27:37,038
up to your

953
00:27:34,798 --> 00:27:38,639
outtakes all of your outtakes your

954
00:27:37,038 --> 00:27:41,278
exhaust even if they're going under the

955
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:43,200
house i would still put a carbon filter

956
00:27:41,278 --> 00:27:45,119
on all of your outtakes and just run

957
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,600
those exhausts 24 hours a day

958
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:49,119
to keep that air moving you may be able

959
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:51,759
to turn off the fans on the

960
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:53,678
intake because that outtake the exhaust

961
00:27:51,759 --> 00:27:55,038
will passively pull air in through the

962
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:56,399
intakes you'll get enough replacement

963
00:27:55,038 --> 00:27:58,879
air through displacement

964
00:27:56,398 --> 00:28:00,479
hopefully i don't know your space but

965
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,200
most of the time typically that's what

966
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,519
will happen

967
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,200
so make sure you're running your carbon

968
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:05,918
filter on your exhaust to keep that air

969
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,600
out of there

970
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:09,278
i think i covered most of that then the

971
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:12,398
last part of the question says

972
00:28:09,278 --> 00:28:15,359
also um what material could i use to

973
00:28:12,398 --> 00:28:17,759
make a good seal on the doors to my room

974
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:19,359
i recommend weather stripping dude or

975
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:20,798
the flaps that they sell

976
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:22,719
use that flap that goes on the bottom to

977
00:28:20,798 --> 00:28:23,200
cover the light lower that as low as you

978
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,278
can

979
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:27,200
then also use weather stripping on the

980
00:28:25,278 --> 00:28:28,720
inside of the door to where it seals

981
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:31,360
real tight up against the wall

982
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,399
then they sell other flaps um i can't

983
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:33,918
remember what they're called they're

984
00:28:32,398 --> 00:28:35,519
near the weather stripping if you go to

985
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:37,278
your local hardware store

986
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:38,960
there's they're like six foot sections

987
00:28:37,278 --> 00:28:40,480
of weather stripping that'll screw in

988
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,000
so the door will close and fit right up

989
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,360
against that you put this one stripping

990
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,640
on one side you put this [ __ ] on the

991
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:45,519
other side and they fit up perfectly

992
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,960
together

993
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:48,558
that's a little bit overkill in my

994
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,558
opinion the weather stripping does very

995
00:28:48,558 --> 00:28:51,519
well in any facility any grow that i've

996
00:28:50,558 --> 00:28:53,918
worked in

997
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:55,679
so that is a great question if you want

998
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:57,038
to cool that flower room drop the head

999
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:58,080
in the flower room if you want to cool

1000
00:28:57,038 --> 00:29:00,558
both rooms

1001
00:28:58,079 --> 00:29:01,759
uh put the head of the air conditioner

1002
00:29:00,558 --> 00:29:04,079
in the middle

1003
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:05,359
where else are we use those exhausts

1004
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:07,678
with carbon filters

1005
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:09,759
if you're not running co2 you may not

1006
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:10,720
need to use the intake fans but you can

1007
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:11,839
if you want to

1008
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,120
think about the amount of air you're

1009
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:15,359
putting in and the amount of air you're

1010
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:17,678
taking out are the fans the same size

1011
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:19,038
um do you have any sort of displacement

1012
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:20,320
do you want negative or positive

1013
00:29:19,038 --> 00:29:21,839
pressure in that room those are things

1014
00:29:20,319 --> 00:29:22,879
to think about things you can adjust at

1015
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:24,879
this point

1016
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,480
and then smell always use a carbon

1017
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:29,600
filter and put

1018
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:30,798
those uh weather stripping on your door

1019
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:32,480
all right how long have we been going

1020
00:29:30,798 --> 00:29:33,679
just about 30 minutes i think i didn't

1021
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,880
write down the start time

1022
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:36,399
we're going to keep going i do have a

1023
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,520
couple of more messages these can be

1024
00:29:36,398 --> 00:29:39,278
quick

1025
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:40,720
this one came from somebody who we don't

1026
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:41,519
need to mention their name they know who

1027
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,600
they are

1028
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:44,879
but it says what's up dude i'm coming to

1029
00:29:43,599 --> 00:29:47,759
you for some advice

1030
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:49,120
bro um we spoke last a little bit about

1031
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:50,798
getting in the industry

1032
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:52,158
well i'm sure you get hundreds of emails

1033
00:29:50,798 --> 00:29:53,759
from growers like this but i hope you

1034
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:55,120
consider this one different

1035
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:57,038
anyway i've been growing cannabis for

1036
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:59,278
close to two years consistently

1037
00:29:57,038 --> 00:30:01,278
i've been for off and on a little bit

1038
00:29:59,278 --> 00:30:02,640
longer due to being in an area where it

1039
00:30:01,278 --> 00:30:04,319
is illegal to grow

1040
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,240
but decriminalization for possession

1041
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:07,439
puts me at risk for dail uh daily for

1042
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,720
myself and my family

1043
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:12,320
kind of going fast i want to get to the

1044
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:14,319
point um so this person basically

1045
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:16,000
they're in an area where they have

1046
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:16,558
commercial facilities but they cannot

1047
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,319
afford

1048
00:30:16,558 --> 00:30:20,240
licensing and they kind of want to get

1049
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:21,519
to growing legally it says i wanted to

1050
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,440
get a backstory to you

1051
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:24,720
but then it says do you know of any

1052
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,558
facilities that are looking

1053
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,319
to hire my wife and i have already

1054
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:29,359
discussed and she's fine with me having

1055
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:31,599
to travel

1056
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:32,959
if you know of someone or anybody who

1057
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:34,398
needs help or wants help trimming

1058
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,720
propagating transplanting should all

1059
00:30:34,398 --> 00:30:38,479
even sweep the floors uh basically this

1060
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:42,240
person is looking for a job here

1061
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:43,519
in colorado and i hate to be this guy

1062
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:46,558
but

1063
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:48,319
there aren't any cannabis jobs

1064
00:30:46,558 --> 00:30:50,639
excuse me there aren't any there aren't

1065
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:52,079
many cannabis jobs popping open

1066
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,320
at this time we're in the middle of a

1067
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:56,240
pandemic we're in the middle of covid

1068
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:57,519
most of the big facilities have gone on

1069
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,278
a skeleton crew

1070
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:01,038
if they used to have six guys now they

1071
00:30:59,278 --> 00:31:02,398
got three if they used to have ten dudes

1072
00:31:01,038 --> 00:31:04,000
now they've got four

1073
00:31:02,398 --> 00:31:06,158
we've really minimized staff so that

1074
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,720
we're not getting as many people sick

1075
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:09,360
the trim crew is minimized everybody is

1076
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,679
cut down

1077
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:12,639
the stores are down to minimal staff so

1078
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:14,720
unfortunately

1079
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,000
there is not much hiring happening in

1080
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:18,720
the colorado cannabis

1081
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,398
industry irie genetics specifically is a

1082
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,240
very small operation

1083
00:31:20,398 --> 00:31:23,518
people seem to think uh and i love that

1084
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,480
we've built this illusion that it's a

1085
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:27,120
giant company

1086
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:28,079
iriegenetics is me it's just me

1087
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:29,678
sometimes i get

1088
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:31,119
a couple of people to help me package

1089
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:33,120
things one or two people have

1090
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:34,239
volunteered and been paid to put seeds

1091
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:36,479
the bubbles into the

1092
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:38,000
the cardboard packs but i touch all the

1093
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,440
seeds i do all the packaging

1094
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,880
i get very minimal help i have some

1095
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,159
shipping help and some packaging help

1096
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,760
but that's about it shout out to my

1097
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:47,039
helpers you guys know who you are

1098
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:48,720
not ignoring you but 99.9 of irie

1099
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:50,319
genetics is me so i don't need

1100
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,720
uh too much more help i don't i couldn't

1101
00:31:50,319 --> 00:31:54,480
hire anybody to give them a reliable

1102
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,759
income or anything like that so

1103
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,519
unfortunately i don't have any good

1104
00:31:55,759 --> 00:31:58,960
advice for you on the hiring part i do

1105
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:00,240
need a quick drink my throat is parched

1106
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:03,600
that's why i was stuttering a moment ago

1107
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,599
let me take a drink and i'll keep going

1108
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:10,399
all right now i'm ready for another long

1109
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:12,079
ramble um

1110
00:32:10,398 --> 00:32:14,479
you said that there are producers in

1111
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:16,798
your area getting licenses

1112
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:18,000
my suggestion is you said you cannot

1113
00:32:16,798 --> 00:32:19,759
come up the money to get your own

1114
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,880
license go to one of those people and

1115
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:22,720
apply there

1116
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,799
uh get a good background in a commercial

1117
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,159
cultivation area where you already are

1118
00:32:24,798 --> 00:32:28,000
you've got a family you've got a lady

1119
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:30,399
you've got a baby on the way let's not

1120
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
uproot you for a hopeful career when

1121
00:32:30,398 --> 00:32:34,079
maybe you can find a career right there

1122
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,519
in your own backyard that's my advice

1123
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:37,678
go to one of those facilities that is

1124
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:39,278
producing go to the dispensaries go

1125
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:40,720
everywhere and apply all you have to do

1126
00:32:39,278 --> 00:32:42,398
is make a good resume

1127
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,558
make a resume just like you would apply

1128
00:32:42,398 --> 00:32:46,719
for any other position also add that you

1129
00:32:44,558 --> 00:32:49,599
were a passionate cannabis cultivator

1130
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,000
be professional be on time speak well

1131
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:51,918
dress

1132
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,119
decently it is a grow position it is a

1133
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:54,960
cultivation position

1134
00:32:53,119 --> 00:32:56,558

mike

1170
00:33:51,278 --> 00:33:54,720
i've been trying to get better at being

1171
00:33:53,759 --> 00:33:56,240
an interviewer

1172
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,919
i'm not the best interviewer on a

1173
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,278
podcast i feel like i run people over

1174
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:01,360
because i've got a lot to say i've got

1175
00:33:59,278 --> 00:34:03,839
an agenda i know how i want to say it

1176
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:05,678
i just talk so i'm trying to become a

1177
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:06,639
better interviewer a better podcaster i

1178
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:08,878
want to have more

1179
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:10,480
guests on my show via zoom people that

1180
00:34:08,878 --> 00:34:11,838
aren't just my good friends when jesse

1181
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,800
comes over it's easy that's like hanging

1182
00:34:11,838 --> 00:34:14,159
out with my bro

1183
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,599
when mike is here that's just like

1184
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:16,159
hanging out with my bro there's no work

1185
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:17,519
to that

1186
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:18,960
but i want to be able to interview and

1187
00:34:17,519 --> 00:34:20,000
hang out more comfortably with other

1188
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,679
people

1189
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,280
the only way i can do that is by

1190
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:25,358
interviewing and hanging out

1191
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,720
