the IG gr culture podcast for much

156
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,280

iTunes doesn't appreciate people ripping

00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,680
off the eye so we're just going to be

163

respectful we're going to change it to

164
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,400
grow from your heart cuz that's what

165
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:41,519
this is all about I've always said grow

166
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:43,038
from your heart uh if you grow your herb

167
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:44,959
your cannabis your medicine from your

168
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:46,560
heart uh you will produce better

169
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:49,198
cannabis if you don't grow your cannabis

170
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,959
from your wallet or your ego or your

171
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,360
camera I know I take a lot of pictures

172
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:54,719
but I grow dank herb because I grow from

173
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,520
my heart that's why I'm able to take the

174
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,280
Dank pictures I'm not thinking about my

175
00:05:56,519 --> 00:06:00,439
wallet I'm not thinking about the

176
00:05:58,279 --> 00:06:02,799
Harvest weight I pay attention to that

177
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:04,439
stuff but when I'm in the grow room I'm

178
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,598
thinking about what's going to happen

179
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:09,839
after I grow this herb properly after I

180
00:06:07,598 --> 00:06:12,199
flush it after I chop it down after I

181
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:14,598
trim it after I cure it after I give it

182
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:16,160
to my patients that smoke this cannabis

183
00:06:14,598 --> 00:06:17,478
I've got an older friend uh his initials

184
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,160
are DC I don't really want to call him

185
00:06:17,478 --> 00:06:20,918
out on the show but he's who I think of

186
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,240
when I think of medical cannabis he's a

187
00:06:20,918 --> 00:06:25,159
good friend of mine and I'm his

188
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:28,400
caregiver when I see him consume the

189
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:30,720
herb that I put my love into I can see

190
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:33,079
him get something inside of him feels

191
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,160
better and it's not just a physical

192
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:36,719
thing it's not just him getting high

193
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,319
there's an emotional thing that happens

194
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,520
to that guy when my medicine makes him

195
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,479
feel better and that emotional thing

196
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:45,079
happens back to me and it fulfills my

197
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:46,279
heart so I grow from my heart and you

198
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:49,079
should grow from your heart as well and

199
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:52,159
I think it'll improve your outlook on

200
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:53,959
your weed it'll improve your cannabis

201
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,919
overall it'll improve your relationship

202
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:56,959
with your patience uh it'll just make

203
00:06:55,918 --> 00:06:58,120
things a lot better grow from your heart

204
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:59,719

205

motto grow from your

210
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:10,559
heart um coming with a new name requires

211
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:12,318
a new logo um I can't change the name

212
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,759
until I have a sweet ass new logo so if

213
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,800
any of you artists out there would like

214
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:19,759
to uh throw me down a grow from your

215
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,560
heart podcast hosted by rosta Jeff logo

216
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,319
I would appreciate it I don't have a lot

217
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,959
of money to tell you the truth but I

218
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:26,800
would compensate you in some way that

219
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:29,000
made you happy it may take time it may

220
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,199
take payments it may take multiple gifts

221
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,399
over time

222
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:33,960
we will work something out because uh I

223
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:35,279
like to pay back my community that helps

224
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:37,878
me out and you like to help your

225
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:41,119
community out so do me a favor make me a

226
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:42,639
logo I have this Vision uh Jesse said it

227
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,158
actually it's a seed like if you've ever

228
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,038
grown pot when you germinate seeds they

229
00:07:44,158 --> 00:07:47,839
crack open and the Tap Root comes out of

230
00:07:46,038 --> 00:07:49,478
there when that cracks open it kind of

231
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:51,198
makes the shape of a heart so if you

232
00:07:49,478 --> 00:07:52,680
could kind of make that into a heart

233
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,240
with the the little thing coming out of

234
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,918
it but then make that tap rout actually

235
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,639
turning into maybe I don't know you can

236
00:07:55,918 --> 00:07:59,719
get creative but I want to see that

237
00:07:57,639 --> 00:08:01,158
heart coming out or just whatever with a

238
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,680
heart in it or grow from your heart of

239
00:08:01,158 --> 00:08:04,719
course I like red yellow and green I'm a

240
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:06,038
Rastafarian if you do that I've never

241
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,159
said this on a podcast if you're going

242
00:08:06,038 --> 00:08:10,000
to make a

243
00:08:07,158 --> 00:08:11,439
Rastafarian themed logo the red goes on

244
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,158
the bottom you guys it's red gold and

245
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:15,120
green Yes red yellow green but the red

246
00:08:13,158 --> 00:08:17,879
is on the bottom so it's actually green

247
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,399
yellow red so do that properly if you're

248
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:20,800
going to make me a logo because I'm a

249
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:22,359
rosta and I want it right because it's

250
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,598
almost disrespectful to put your logo

251
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,680
with the colors upside down if you're

252
00:08:23,598 --> 00:08:26,959
bringing it in a Rasta way I'm not going

253
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,519
to [ __ ] about it I'm just saying do it

254
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:29,878
the right way if you're a real rosta

255
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:31,318
you'll understand why you want it the

256
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:32,800
right way it's like if I put the

257
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:34,320
American flag upside down it would piss

258
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,519
a lot of Americans off so just imagine

259
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,120
you people getting the roster flag

260
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,399
backwards it kind of frustrates some

261
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,320
people I don't give too much of a [ __ ]

262
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:43,278
about it I'm just letting you know that

263
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:45,120
you're doing it wrong um yeah also um we

264
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:46,559
need a new theme song I've been playing

265
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,799
The Mystic Roots band it sounds awesome

266
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:49,879
but wouldn't it be a lot cooler if I had

267
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:51,719
a customized theme song that was like

268
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:53,159
something about grow from your heart I

269
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,160

culture or igro it's igro culture or you

00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:38,200

327
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:39,759
you just want to hit me directly I check

328
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:42,278
them both quite frequently like once a

329
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:44,399
day probably this dude says bro I love

330
00:10:42,278 --> 00:10:45,838
the podcast it's the first podcast I've

331
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:49,320
been into I'm going to have to start

332
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:50,440
from the beginning and catch up um okay

333
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,560
I'm embarrassed that you're going to do

334
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,959
that because honestly well let me not

335
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:57,479
say I'm embarrassed I guess I'm proud

336
00:10:53,958 --> 00:11:00,199
now the first uh 25 episodes or so I

337
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:01,800
didn't know what I was doing

338
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,320
I turned on the microphone and just

339
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:05,159
blurted out a bunch of [ __ ] and whatever

340
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,680
came out of my face is how the show went

341
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:08,278
and then I started making too many notes

342
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:09,359
and it got a little weird but I feel

343
00:11:08,278 --> 00:11:11,078
like I'm kind of comfortable with the

344
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,600
microphone now I just turn it on I start

345
00:11:11,078 --> 00:11:15,479
I make a few bullet points and start

346
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:17,879
going and it all comes out I'm not so uh

347
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:19,399
so hypercritical of it now but dude uh

348
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:20,958
party McFly and the way you wrote your

349
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:23,559
Twitter handle is pretty cool I can't

350
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:27,319
even uh I don't know what how you did

351
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:28,919
that but it's @ frivolous f r i v o l if

00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:56,039

iTunes or Stitcher or whatever the feed

367
00:11:56,039 --> 00:11:58,879

371
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:08,440
super easy I hope so party I'm rambling

372
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:10,719
I took a bunch of dabs a lot of dabs I

373
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:13,600
made these dabs even uh party McFly

374
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:17,040
thanks for messaging me on Twitter my

375
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:20,159
next tweet came from Roadrunner it's _

376
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:22,679
Runner 420 he said listening from the UK

377
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:24,399
still underground here but great to see

378
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:27,078
you guys leading the way for us great

379
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:28,440
show keep it up dude thanks a lot uh

380
00:12:27,078 --> 00:12:30,120
those words of encouragement mean a lot

381
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,839
to me like I was saying everybody wants

382
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:33,000
to hear that they're doing right

383
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:34,519
sometimes you just put in a bunch of

384
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,120
work and nobody says anything and you're

385
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:38,000
like ah but you guys have been making me

386
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:41,078
feel like I'm killing it so awesome

387
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,480
thank you we've gotten uh 6,500 listens

388
00:12:41,078 --> 00:12:45,239
on some episodes uh the episode with

389
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:47,480
King Cola is probably going to hit

390
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,799
10,000 episodes eventually that will be

391
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:51,240
the first one to do it which is

392
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:52,838
remarkable because it's a newer episode

393
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:55,120
and there's been a lot of time on other

394
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:56,839
shows and they haven't been listened to

395
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,519
nearly as much as the episodes with King

396
00:12:56,839 --> 00:13:00,760
Cola so shout out to King Cola and

397
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:02,919
episode 35 with drying and curing also

398
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:05,480
has been a huge success if you guys

399
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:07,039
haven't listened to that one it's time

400
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:09,800
go back and listen to number 35 if I had

401
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:11,198
a recommendation for you 35 and then uh

402
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:13,719
the ones with King Cola I don't remember

403
00:13:11,198 --> 00:13:16,240
the numbers I could pause and look hold

404
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:18,959
on all right I went back and checked um

405
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:22,039
I honestly think that from 35 on is

406
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:23,719
where if 35 through 45 are some of our

407
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:26,879
best episodes ever there are a couple in

408
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:28,560
there uh 44 is random chatter because uh

409
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:31,679
we got chatty and then 41 is chatty

410
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:33,599
stoners but for the most part the 35

411
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:37,319
through 45 are some of my favorite most

412
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:40,278
proud episodes um 45 more about Organics

413
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:42,399
with King Cola 43 intro to Organics with

414
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:45,078
King Cola those are some great episodes

415
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:47,159
number 42 intro to NPK that got a lot of

416
00:13:45,078 --> 00:13:50,319
response uh the episodes about building

417
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:52,799

418
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:55,320

419
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:57,479
did a lot and 35 drying and curing

420
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:59,240

421
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,720

726
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:22,720
see you through everyone stole from

00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,600
Steve Winwood Holm says his foot tapping

728
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,640
as he injects a syringe of dark syrupy

00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:28,519
liquid into his gas

chromatograph no one is stealing from

731
00:24:28,519 --> 00:24:33,000
Holmes a self-taught scientist engineer

732
00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:34,919
farmer and cannabis seed geek who next

733
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,519
month will take a rare step to apply for

734
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:40,120
a patent on a laborous created cannabis

735
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:42,278
super strain if it is awarded the US

736
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:44,519
patent on Holmes medical grade auto2

737
00:24:42,278 --> 00:24:46,398
strain will be the first to protect a

738
00:24:44,519 --> 00:24:48,158
cannabis plant and a first step in

739
00:24:46,398 --> 00:24:50,158
establishing plant breeder rights for

740
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:52,720
Growers who only a few years ago were

741
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:54,840
considered criminals now I said the The

742
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:58,038
Strain is called Auto 2 uh it's spelled

743
00:24:54,839 --> 00:24:59,879
OT t o and then the Roman numeral 2 it's

744
00:24:58,038 --> 00:25:01,640
not Auto like autof flow so I just want

745
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:03,159
to clear that up it's the same word

746
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,600
essentially I'm saying Auto and I would

747
00:25:03,159 --> 00:25:06,399
say Auto if it were spelled the other

748
00:25:04,599 --> 00:25:08,359
way so if you guys are haters of

749
00:25:06,398 --> 00:25:10,558
autoflowers uh that's not what it is

750
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:13,038
it's just Auto like uh the dude from The

751
00:25:10,558 --> 00:25:15,278
Simpsons it's probably got uh some

752
00:25:13,038 --> 00:25:17,398
Canadian influence I would assume right

753
00:25:15,278 --> 00:25:18,880
anyway uh this industry came up in

754
00:25:17,398 --> 00:25:20,798
stealth born in basements and crawl

755
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,399
spaces holes said but now with companies

756
00:25:20,798 --> 00:25:23,960
forming and making larger Investments

757
00:25:22,398 --> 00:25:25,839
the desire to protect intellectual

758
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:28,558
property is becoming Paramount bleeding

759
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:30,240
edge stuff right here and I this is kind

760
00:25:28,558 --> 00:25:34,200
of hits home to me because I breed seeds

761
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:35,278
and I create strains and I see people um

762
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,360
I don't want to say ripping them off

763
00:25:35,278 --> 00:25:38,079
because I don't know if they thought of

764
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:41,240
it before me if they just happen to post

765
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:43,359
it to Instagram after me but people we

766
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:46,159
like to borrow names in this industry

767
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:47,158
for strains we uh we think we're coming

768
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:48,000
up with something original you guys are

769
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:49,278
going to hear a thumping noise I'm

770
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,038
moving this microphone it's sliding

771
00:25:49,278 --> 00:25:52,558
sorry here we go got to tighten this up

772
00:25:51,038 --> 00:25:53,960
tighten up now here we go sorry if that

773
00:25:52,558 --> 00:25:55,119
sounds like [ __ ] in the recording I'm

774
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:58,000
not going to censor that or edit that

775
00:25:55,119 --> 00:26:01,278
out at all so making stuff my strains

776
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,398
get stolen often and I can't complain

777
00:26:01,278 --> 00:26:04,880
about it because I'm actually using

778
00:26:03,398 --> 00:26:06,599
other people's strains to make mine

779
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:09,120
somebody had to make the seeds for me to

780
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:10,240
breed with but just give credit I guess

781
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:13,519
but now people are going to be able to

782
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:16,319
patent stuff so what I'm worried about

783
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:18,558
mainly are people with more money going

784
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:19,879
to punk me and patent my [ __ ] and

785
00:26:18,558 --> 00:26:22,359
squeeze me right out are you going to

786
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:24,240
see other people claiming that they own

787
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:25,599
Capleton that's what I'm worried about

788
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:28,079
and I don't I don't know the legal parts

789
00:26:25,599 --> 00:26:30,079
of this enough to know but I do know

790
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:31,798
that I don't have any money compared to

791
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:32,918
a lot of these people I am small time

792
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:35,200
compared to a lot of these people

793
00:26:32,919 --> 00:26:37,278
compared to Greenhouse compared to the

794
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,840
Cali Connection compared to DNA I am

795
00:26:37,278 --> 00:26:40,919
nobody and those guys could squeeze me

796
00:26:38,839 --> 00:26:43,359
out tomorrow if they wanted to but

797
00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:44,720
luckily we're a friendly industry big

798
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:46,199
business doesn't give a [ __ ] about

799
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,558
friendly industry they'll squeeze us all

800
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,880
out by doing this kind of stuff because

801
00:26:47,558 --> 00:26:50,918
they've got the money that's what I fear

802
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:53,159
but I'm a paranoid hippie uh I've been

803
00:26:50,919 --> 00:26:54,399
on too many fish parking lots to have a

804
00:26:53,159 --> 00:26:56,399
clear head about that kind of [ __ ] I

805
00:26:54,398 --> 00:26:58,359
just always think the the paranoid part

806
00:26:56,398 --> 00:27:00,558
so let me read more more of the article

807
00:26:58,359 --> 00:27:02,599
it says indeed gone are the days when

808
00:27:00,558 --> 00:27:04,398
pie-eyed long hairs haphazardly hurled

809
00:27:02,599 --> 00:27:07,240
pollen into jungles of pot plants hoping

810
00:27:04,398 --> 00:27:09,879
to meld two strains damn that's such a

811
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:12,120
great cliche in one [ __ ] sentence I

812
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:14,880
love that let's see what we got we got

813
00:27:12,119 --> 00:27:16,918
pie-eyed long hairs so you can see those

814
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:20,440
guys pie eyed long hairs all I'm high

815
00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:22,440
and I got big eyes right I long hair so

816
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:23,840
halfhazard Le hurling pollen they're

817
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,960
just got this male plant and they're

818
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:28,398
just beating it into the room into

819
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:29,558
jungles of pot plants so no strain

820
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:32,839
selection here let's just put a bunch of

821
00:27:29,558 --> 00:27:34,200
females in here and yeah sorry I'm just

822
00:27:32,839 --> 00:27:37,158
talking [ __ ] out about this sentence it

823
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:38,880
was great hoping to meld two strains uh

824
00:27:37,159 --> 00:27:40,919
today's top readers are geneticists

825
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,399
taking years uh to weed through

826
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:44,519
carefully engineered generations of

827
00:27:42,398 --> 00:27:46,079
cannabis to elevate the most desired

828
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:48,200
traits now that's a pretty accurate

829
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:49,720
statement I will agree with that uh some

830
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:52,360
of the new super strains are high in

831
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:54,720
canabidol or CBD one of several dozen

832
00:27:52,359 --> 00:27:56,879
canabo chemical compounds in cannabis

833
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:59,440
and the plant's major non- psychoactive

834
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:01,278
ingredient a man I was proud cuz he said

835
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:04,278
chemical compound but then he said

836
00:28:01,278 --> 00:28:05,759
ingredient and then that ruined him I'm

837
00:28:04,278 --> 00:28:07,278
so critical of these guys' articles and

838
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:09,200
I bet I say some really dumb [ __ ] on the

839
00:28:07,278 --> 00:28:10,679
podcast cuz I'm high but these guys have

840
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,200
editors and proof readers and [ __ ] I'm

841
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:16,519
just here spouting it out I've taken

842
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:17,919
dabs and drank mate and can't be held

843
00:28:16,519 --> 00:28:20,839
accountable for anything I say after

844
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:23,038
that all right CBD has been credited

845
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:24,839
with relieving some epil epileptic

846
00:28:23,038 --> 00:28:27,278
seizures prompting widespread calls for

847
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:29,359
additional research uh other more

848
00:28:27,278 --> 00:28:31,000
utilitarian super strains are resistant

849
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:32,678
to mites or the crop killing powdery

850

that plagues grow operations across

854
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:40,840
Colorado it sounds like we only have

855
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:42,558
that here they have powdery milw all

856
00:28:40,839 --> 00:28:44,879
over the place bro I don't know why

857
00:28:42,558 --> 00:28:45,759
you're singling out Colorado it does

858
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,000
happen

859
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:49,000
here all right I'll quit ranting about

860
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,640
that part let's get more into the

861
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:54,079
article here uh where was I some super

the psychoactive compound in

865
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,839
cannabis uh you got to scroll way down

866
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:05,720
there's like seven ads here here we go

his plans to protect Auto 2 which ranks

among the most valuable of his

valuable an annuity said Holmes a father

901
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:21,200
of two who serves on the state's

902
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:22,960
Industrial Hemp advisory committee and

903
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,200
is collaborate collaborating on the

00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:27,558
University of Colorado's groundbreaking

905
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,720
cannabis genomic research initiative and

906
00:30:27,558 --> 00:30:31,158
if you guys haven't checked that out you

907
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:33,679
should uh I'll say it again it's the

908
00:30:31,159 --> 00:30:35,399
Cannabis genomic research initiative

909
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:36,880
there's a link to it in this article on

910
00:30:35,398 --> 00:30:39,038
the Cannabis so if you can find this

911
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:41,320
article on the Cannabis it's the article

912
00:30:39,038 --> 00:30:44,519
about pot growers new Quest US Patent

913
00:30:41,319 --> 00:30:47,398
patent protection uh this link is in

914
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:48,640
that article so everyone who does this

915
00:30:47,398 --> 00:30:50,719
wants to produce something with

916
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:53,480
durability he said a seed with good

917
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:55,720
utility that produces well uh can have

918
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:57,798
longetivity for Generations which is

919
00:30:55,720 --> 00:31:00,639
very true uh I've read a few strains

920
00:30:57,798 --> 00:31:02,359
that uh I can keep those seeds around

921
00:31:00,638 --> 00:31:03,798
and that Capleton the Bounty Killer will

922
00:31:02,359 --> 00:31:05,000
be good forever I'm going to get back

923
00:31:03,798 --> 00:31:08,440
into the article here that was kind of a

924
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:10,798
random rant it says Holmes is sort of a

925
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:13,120
modern-day Luther Luther Burbank who you

926
00:31:10,798 --> 00:31:14,879
should read about guys the P pioneering

927
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:16,719
American botanist in horticulturist who

928
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,639
developed more than 800 varieties and

929
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:21,600
strains of plants in the late 1800s and

930
00:31:18,638 --> 00:31:23,798
early 1900s his name is Luther Burbank

931
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:25,719
if you want to Google him uh Wikipedia

932
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:27,398
that guy Burbank faced intellectual

933
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:29,960
property challenges in his career as he

934
00:31:27,398 --> 00:31:31,839
created still Herald peaches plums

935
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:34,600
daisies and the world dominant Burbank

936
00:31:31,839 --> 00:31:36,798
Russet potato Holmes follows burbank's

937
00:31:34,599 --> 00:31:38,599
lead offering a few types of seeds to a

938
00:31:36,798 --> 00:31:40,038
single large distributor who can flood

939
00:31:38,599 --> 00:31:41,839
the market in the first year before

940
00:31:40,038 --> 00:31:44,240
anyone can take it as their own by

941
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:46,839
cloning the young seedlings uh so this

942
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:50,319
guy's idea and that's a good idea uh

943
00:31:46,839 --> 00:31:52,638
he's going to put out so many seeds so

944
00:31:50,319 --> 00:31:55,278
quickly that everybody will know it's

945
00:31:52,638 --> 00:31:56,759
his because it'll be flooded but nobody

946
00:31:55,278 --> 00:31:58,278
will uh be able to claim it before they

947
00:31:56,759 --> 00:31:59,798
can cut a clone because he'll be so well

948
00:31:58,278 --> 00:32:01,519
known for putting it out that's pretty

949
00:31:59,798 --> 00:32:03,918
smart he just puts out so many that

950
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:05,558
they're like oh it's got to be him cuz

951
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:07,639
everyone's got the seeds yeah that makes

952
00:32:05,558 --> 00:32:09,000
sense to me I like that it's a good idea

953
00:32:07,638 --> 00:32:10,359
I might start hoarding certain strains

954
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,200
when I make seeds now just make a whole

955
00:32:10,359 --> 00:32:13,519
bunch of them until I can do that no I

956
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:15,360
wouldn't do that I'm just joking sorry

957
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:17,558
guys by the time copycats have cloned

958
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:19,479
holmes' strains he's already uh he

959
00:32:17,558 --> 00:32:21,480
already has made his money he also

960
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:23,000
licenses the use of his Heirloom Seeds

961
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:25,639
but not the extra special seeds he

962
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,278
doesn't want copied uh really the focus

963
00:32:25,638 --> 00:32:28,839
minus any patent protection is non-

964
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:31,159
licensing and careful selection of

965
00:32:28,839 --> 00:32:32,720

protecting intellectual property through

969
00:32:36,638 --> 00:32:41,759
state law is a bandage patents are

970
00:32:39,278 --> 00:32:44,159
exclusively federal marijuana is illegal

971
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:46,519
under federal law and federal law

972
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:48,720
Trump's state law so this guy could get

973
00:32:46,519 --> 00:32:50,399
completely denied for his attempt at

974
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:52,519
patenting his cannabis strain but if he

975
00:32:50,398 --> 00:32:54,879
does he's going to open the floodgates

976
00:32:52,519 --> 00:32:57,638
for a lot of [ __ ] and people will start

977
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,360
patenting their own strains I bet you

978
00:32:57,638 --> 00:33:00,959
and that's that means I'm going to have

979
00:32:58,359 --> 00:33:02,240
to get on the game uh get lawyered up a

980
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,798
little bit harder for a lawyer that

981
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,440
knows about patent laws too God this

982
00:33:04,798 --> 00:33:08,558
game is getting so vast you have to have

983
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:10,080
your hands in everything now to be able

984
00:33:08,558 --> 00:33:11,839
to keep up in this kind of a business if

985
00:33:10,079 --> 00:33:14,000
you guys want to move to Colorado and

986
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:15,798
get in the Cannabis industry I recommend

987
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,398
you do like a year of research before

988
00:33:15,798 --> 00:33:19,599
you get into it maybe come here and talk

989
00:33:17,398 --> 00:33:20,599
to somebody who's in the industry uh I

990
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:22,038
could help you out a little bit I don't

991
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:24,480
know a lot about getting into the

992
00:33:22,038 --> 00:33:26,278
industry I don't like into if you want a

993
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,399
dispensary or something it I don't know

994
00:33:26,278 --> 00:33:30,519
how to get you into there that's going

995
00:33:27,398 --> 00:33:31,798
to be hard so be careful let's see what

996
00:33:30,519 --> 00:33:34,120
else do I want to talk about in this

997
00:33:31,798 --> 00:33:36,158
episode I wanted to talk about the new

998
00:33:34,119 --> 00:33:37,719
year is coming up and the new year is

999
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:39,320
always a good time everybody says they

1000
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:41,839
want to do New Year's resolutions and

1001
00:33:39,319 --> 00:33:45,000
stuff I think it's a good time to start

1002
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:47,439
a new grow calendar or a schedule to

1003
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,398
kind of make a game plan clean up your

1004
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:52,038
grow room get everything started fresh

1005
00:33:49,398 --> 00:33:53,359
again and then instead of just cutting a

1006
00:33:52,038 --> 00:33:55,000
bunch of clones and having a bunch of

1007
00:33:53,359 --> 00:33:56,558
plants and veg and having some [ __ ] over

1008
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,359
here and some more [ __ ] over here think

1009
00:33:56,558 --> 00:33:59,839
about what you're going to do

1010
00:33:58,359 --> 00:34:01,879
think about how many lights you have in

1011
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:04,000
each space how many flowering lights do

1012
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:06,240
you have how many plants fit under each

1013
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,358
of those lights how long do they take to

1014
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:11,519
flower okay so you got about 65 days

1015
00:34:09,358 --> 00:34:13,639
underneath this light right well in

1016
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:14,918
about 65 days you need more plants to go

1017
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:16,838
under there but you need a couple days

1018
00:34:14,918 --> 00:34:18,559
to clean that you got to trim you got to

1019
00:34:16,838 --> 00:34:19,759
sweep up you got to wipe the walls down

1020
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:21,358
you got to clean all the dirt out you

1021
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:24,240
got to repot you got to get [ __ ] back in

1022
00:34:21,358 --> 00:34:25,598
there so remember that in like 9 weeks

1023
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:28,479
you need more plants in there so you got

1024
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:30,000
to cut clones about 3 to four maybe 5

1025
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,358
weeks before that depending on how much

1026
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,679
space you have you got to get your [ __ ]

1027
00:34:31,358 --> 00:34:35,679
ready so start planning I think it's a

1028
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:38,159
good time for you guys to start working

1029
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:40,119
on an advanced grow

1030
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:41,599
calendar I don't know how you want to do

1031
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:43,519
it there are a lot of ways to go about

1032
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:44,960
it do it your way is what I recommend

1033
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:46,838
maybe we'll make an episode out of that

1034
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,240
but it's the start of the year coming up

1035
00:34:46,838 --> 00:34:49,679
and just make a calendar because if you

1036
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:51,319
pop a bunch of seeds you cut a bunch of

1037
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:52,800
clones and you got a vetro full and a

1038
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:54,359
flowering room full and you don't have a

1039
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,879
full plan of where those plants are

1040
00:34:54,358 --> 00:34:58,559
going you're going to run into some

1041
00:34:55,878 --> 00:35:00,239
problems overcrowding causes problems

1042
00:34:58,559 --> 00:35:01,599
overcrowding promotes problems you can't

1043
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:03,199
see that plan on the bottom you can't

1044
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:04,599
tell there was a spidermite infestation

1045
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:06,199
there you got spidermites everywhere you

1046
00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:08,760
got way too many plants the shit's out

1047
00:35:06,199 --> 00:35:11,199
of control just be diligent think in

1048
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:12,520
advance think ahead of yourself be like

1049
00:35:11,199 --> 00:35:14,279
five steps ahead that's how you be a

1050
00:35:12,519 --> 00:35:15,639
good grower kind of try to predict

1051
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:17,760
what's going to happen in your plants

1052
00:35:15,639 --> 00:35:19,960
don't just watch and see what happens be

1053
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,440
like oh this is going to happen because

1054
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:24,159
I've grown weed a million times and I've

1055
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:25,559
paid attention at least 10 of them all

1056
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:26,559
right I'm ranting again but that's

1057
00:35:25,559 --> 00:35:28,759
really important I think and it's the

1058
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:30,320
start of the year so it's time for that

1059
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:31,640
to happen it would be a good time for

1060
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,960
all of that and clean up all your [ __ ]

1061
00:35:31,639 --> 00:35:34,639
right at the start of the year if it's

1062
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:36,559
if your carbon filters are all mie buy

1063
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:38,199
some new carbon filters if your bulbs

1064
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:40,519
are all shitty get some new bulbs it's

1065
00:35:38,199 --> 00:35:44,279
the start of the Year spoil your Gardens

1066
00:35:40,519 --> 00:35:46,358
they spoil you back that's my advice

1067
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:48,839
that's my personal advice from the from

1068
00:35:46,358 --> 00:35:50,400
the heart of rosta Jeff God I must be

1069
