53
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:34,158
we are in a weird transitional time here

54
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:37,039
in colorado the weather is changing from

55
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,640
extremely [ __ ] cold to super nice and

56
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,880
then i think this weekend it is supposed

57
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,200
to go back to extremely [ __ ] cold

58
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:44,879
so welcome to spring winter spring

59
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,960
somewhere in the middle of that [ __ ]

60
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:48,560
uh this is a really challenging time for

61
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:49,039
growers when the weather changes like

62
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,879
this

63
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,880
uh this is when we see powdery mildew

64
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:53,679
issues this is when we see vpd problems

65
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:55,438
in the grow

66
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,520
so good luck i'm wishing you the best of

67
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:58,959
luck i hope you do not get any powdery

68
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:00,158
mildew in your indoor grill with all

69
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:01,359
these weird changes

70
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,719
if you're in colorado if you're

71
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:04,000
somewhere in the midwest you know what

72
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:06,239
i'm talking about right now

73
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,280
it was negative 17 degrees a couple of

74
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:09,598
weeks ago

75
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,280
it got up to 74 degrees a couple of days

76
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,479
ago then this weekend we're supposed to

77
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,318
get dumped on with snow

78
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:15,759
that makes growing really challenging

79
00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:16,958
how do you set up your gear do you set

80
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:17,598
up the air conditioner do you set up the

81
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,439
heater

82
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:21,280
what do you do it's hard to get things

83
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:22,239
going in that sort of environment so i

84
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,080
do feel for you

85
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:25,439
and i wish you the best of luck pay

86
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,160
attention to your monitors if you're

87
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:27,680
using the

88
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:28,799
minder unit the pulse grow whatever

89
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,520
you've got in there telling you what's

90
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,200
going on

91
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,640
stay on top of that check out your

92
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:34,079
nighttime humidity and temperatures

93
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:35,119
because when the sun goes down and that

94
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,200
snow is out there

95
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,719
[ __ ] gets really cold it's time to pay

96
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:41,280
really close attention to all of that

97
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:42,719

i've done an episode on people putting

119
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:17,039
big ass plants outside and finding out

120
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,959
halfway through the season

121
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:20,400
they've got males have you done some sex

122
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,680
testing to find out that your outdoor

123
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,519
plants are females

124
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,360

to guide us through the outdoor season

128
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:34,399
so we can set ourselves up for success

129
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:36,479
in 2021 but to be successful we must

130
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,760

131
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:39,119

planned started ready

133
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,400
start thinking about that [ __ ] before it

134
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:43,919
is way too late

135
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,760
all right welcome to spring winter

136
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:47,679
spring time you guys let's jump into the

137
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:49,199
main topics of this podcast i do have

138
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,080
three wonderful emails that i would like

139
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:51,679
to address

140
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,120
the first one goes a little bit like

141
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,480
this i didn't write down the full email

142
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,438
it was kind of a conversation

143
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:58,000
uh between another friend and he said i

144
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:01,039
am

145
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,719
10 days from week eight and that made me

146
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:05,438
think bro you were in week

147
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:06,719
six settle the [ __ ] down so the thing i

148
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:09,919
wanted to talk about was

149
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:11,759
when a plant when a seed package says

150
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:12,318
that those seeds will be done in eight

151
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:14,079
weeks

152
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:16,159
it doesn't mean when the clock turns to

153
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,079
eight weeks your plants should be done

154
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,639
you've got to finish out that eighth

155
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,040
week

156
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,800
so be patient let those finish that is

157
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,000
not the first day of week eight when

158
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,800
your plants are done

159
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,720
uh when my buddy said i am ten days away

160
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,400
from week eight and i'll get to cut down

161
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,560
in about 10 or 12 days

162
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:34,159
i thought bro that is week the end of

163
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,879
week seven is where you are your

164
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,240
people are getting really uh overzealous

165
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:39,360
maybe the word here they're not giving

166
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,600
the plants the time

167
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,520
so when it says eight weeks those plants

168
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,120
need eight full weeks of

169
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:46,560
flowering time and i'm going to repeat

170
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,600
this i say this quite often on the

171
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,240
podcast

172
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,800
day one of the flowering cycle is when

173
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,280
you

174
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,879
change the timer to 1212. if you are

175
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:56,719
running photoperiod plants

176
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:58,240
if you're running autoflowers do your

177
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,080
thing that's none of my business i don't

178
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,000
know about autos i stay away from those

179
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:04,478
i like photoperiod plants

180
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,600
if you are running photoperiod plants in

181
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:08,399
your garden

182
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,199
day one of flower is when you turn that

183
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:11,839
light cycle

184
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,919
to 12 hours on and 12 hours off or maybe

185
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:15,758
it's 11 13 but you get the point

186
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:17,359
the day you make the flip is when the

187
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,038
plants are now in flower not when you

188
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,199
start seeing pre flower

189
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:22,399
not when the [ __ ] cow jumps over the

190
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,360
moon not when

191
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:25,839
the fat lady sings the day you flip that

192
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,479
is

193
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:29,279
the day plants have gone into flower why

194
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:30,959
would we

195
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:32,799
have a schedule and a calendar that we

196
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:34,159
can mark day one is right now but then

197
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,759
let's just wait a few days until the

198
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,199
plants give us a hint or until some

199
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:40,160
other random [ __ ] happens

200
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,120
that's not how it goes as a seed breeder

201
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,039
as the person

202
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,879
determining how long it takes the plants

203
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:45,439
to flower and marking that on the

204
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:48,399
package

205
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:49,519
i can tell you i am doing it by the day

206
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:50,719
we flip so

207
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:51,918
if you're trying to convince somebody

208
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,199
otherwise if you're trying to go buy

209
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:55,198
something else you are

210
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,240
not doing industry standard industry

211
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,160
standard is

212
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,840
flowering starts the day we flip the

213
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,680
plants to 12 12. so

214
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:03,359
if the package says eight weeks they

215
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,720
need to go eight full weeks not

216
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,400
seven weeks and at the start of eight

217
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,800
week we cut them down they need to

218
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:12,159
finish that eighth week and honestly

219
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,600
be more patient if if your plants are

220
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,240
going to be done at week eight on the

221
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,080
package

222
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,280
let them go to week nine maybe let them

223
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:19,038
go to week ten

224
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:20,959
the rule of thumb is when you think it's

225
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:22,318
ready let it go another week those

226
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:23,120
plants if it's the first time you're

227
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,120
growing it

228
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,560
those plants may show you something new

229
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,079
this is going to be involved in the next

230
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,839
question that i ask also

231
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:31,680
if you let those plants go that last

232
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:33,359
extra week maybe two weeks

233
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,199
you may see things you would have never

234
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,840
seen in that plant maybe at the last 10

235
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,520
days

236
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:39,439
it turns amazing colors maybe in the

237
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:41,198
last five days it really beefs up

238
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:43,038
maybe in that last week or two it really

239
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,000
puts on amazing amounts of trichomes and

240
00:06:43,038 --> 00:06:46,000
potency

241
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,759
maybe the flavor changes completely from

242
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,478
grapefruits to orange rinds in the last

243
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,000
week

244
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:51,839
maybe you just got to let it go and see

245
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,918
what it does so

246
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:55,679
let it go that full eight weeks when we

247
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:57,359
write eight weeks on the package we mean

248
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,360
eight weeks from the day you put it into

249
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,400
flour we do not mean that you can

250
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,160
harvest on

251
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:04,079
the first day of the eighth week you've

252
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,840
got to finish that eighth week so

253
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:07,680
you gotta cut down the first day of the

254
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:08,159
ninth week and then another piece of

255
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,478
advice

256
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,400
is wait longer if you think it's ready

257
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:14,240
wait another week if the seed pack said

258
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:14,879
eight weeks give it nine maybe give it

259
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,960
ten

260
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:18,399
because you're not going to degrade that

261
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:19,839
product too much by letting it go a

262
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:20,159
little bit longer but you can really

263
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:23,439
miss

264
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,840
opportunities by not going long enough

265
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:25,839
so

266
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:27,439
that is my rant on eight weeks i'm glad

267
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:28,318
i had that conversation with my bro you

268
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:29,918
know who you are

269
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,919
i kind of mixed in a couple of details

270
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:33,439
in there from a couple of conversations

271
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:35,359
hope i answered a couple of questions

272
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:37,680
for people hope i solved some problems

273
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,960
again i'm going to recap that when i say

274
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,199
eight weeks of flower

275
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:42,399
i mean eight weeks from the day you turn

276
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,199
the lights to 12

277
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:47,839
12. i also mean a full eight weeks is

278
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:50,960
that 56 days yes i want you to get 56

279
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:52,318
full days of flour in there not 49.

280
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:53,839
i don't want you to cut it down at the

281
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,120
start of week 8 i want you to harvest at

282
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:57,038
the end of week 8.

283
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,800
then i'm going to say you could do it

284
00:07:57,038 --> 00:08:00,240
with my seeds as well if my seed pack

285
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,840
says it's done in eight weeks

286
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,439
give it nine give it ten and see what

287
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:04,959
happens take notes

288
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:06,478
that way the next time you grow it you

289
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:07,198
can do it even better the first time you

290
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:08,639
grow it

291
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,478
uh you're not gonna need to get it

292
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,120
perfect we're gonna talk about that here

293
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:13,519
in this second question this one came

294
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,918
from

295
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:17,439
our friend do they want their name said

296
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:18,399
uh they do not have their name listed

297
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:20,079
here in the email

298
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:21,679
but this one comes from a listener and

299
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:22,878
it says a lot like this do you have an

300
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,959
episode on when

301
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,560
to flush you know i have done an episode

302
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:27,198
on flushing i can't recall the number

303
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,639
right now

304
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,160
i'll drop the number right about here on

305
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,800
the screen i'll also put a link in the

306
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,200
show notes

307
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,320
and you can link right to the flushing

308
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,839
episode

309
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,560
excuse me for stepping over my new

310
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,080
tongue um i do not i do have a flushing

311
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,119
episode i do not remember the number

312
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,560
i'll put the link in the video

313
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,959
description but it says

314
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:46,799
i know how to flush but how can i tell

315
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:49,039
when to start flushing

316
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:50,879
if a seed pack says 60 days should i

317
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:53,360
just start a week or so before

318
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:54,639
then hope it's done around 60 days this

319
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,159
is a great question

320
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:58,399
he says he knows how to flush but i'm

321
00:08:56,159 --> 00:09:00,079
going to cover really briefly on how to

322
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,278
flush it's a really easy method it's a

323
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,720
really easy technique

324
00:09:01,278 --> 00:09:04,000
before i get there let me cover one

325
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,200
thing that i know a lot of people are

326
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,360
going to start saying

327
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,839
flushing is bro science flushing is

328
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,440
pseudoscience flushing is not necessary

329
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,279
there is a lot of controversy in the

330
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,600
cannabis environment right now

331
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:17,360
talking about flushing there's a very uh

332
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,120
popular famous author who went out and

333
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,399
said that flushing is highly unnecessary

334
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,159
that we don't need to do it

335
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,080
there are a lot of other people that say

336
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:26,000
we should be flushing our plants

337
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,360
i am not a scientist i have not gone to

338
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
school for that sort of stuff

339
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,159
i can't give you a definitive scientific

340
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,200
answer i can give you the rosta jeff

341
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:36,079
bros science opinion get ready for it my

342
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,000
email box is

343
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,278
open i'm waiting to hear back from you

344
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,080
here is my opinion

345
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:43,360
on flushing when we are using a super

346
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,360
soil type of medium an

347
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,399
organic environment flushing may not be

348
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,000
as necessary

349
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,159
as when we are feeding our plants

350
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,320
chelated and buffered nutrients

351
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:53,360
um i feel like the plants can kind of

352
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,959
selectively

353
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,240
take up nutrients when they're in that

354
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:58,319
organics but i feel like they're kind of

355
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,240
being force-fed more stuff

356
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,760
more nutrients when we give them the

357
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,759
shellated nutrients

358
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:05,600
so there may be some things we can

359
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:07,919
possibly flush out of the

360
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,920
shalated and buffered plants ah there

361
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:12,078
may be more necessary to do that

362
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:14,319
then something inside of me says what

363
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:16,319
are we trying to flush

364
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,519
like what are we actually flushing out

365
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,360
we're flushing out

366
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,440
the main point of flushing is to clean

367
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,839
the root zone the rhizosphere to remove

368
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,040
all of the nutrients the minerals the

369
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,560
feeding the food

370
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:28,799
from that root zone so that our plant

371
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:30,958
will basically cannibalize itself

372
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:32,799
and our theory is that without those

373
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:34,239
nutrients in the root zone the nutrients

374
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:37,039
will not be in the plant

375
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,759
and then the plant should therefore burn

376
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:39,919
better

377
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:41,838
smoke better taste better and be a

378
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:44,799
better overall product once it's dried

379
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:47,200
and cured and ready for consumption

380
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:48,799
part of me likes that i know i've been

381
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,320
feeding these plants for nine weeks i've

382
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:52,000
been stuffing a bunch of [ __ ] into there

383
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:55,519
and making them get big and beefy

384
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,720
but hasn't all of that stuff metabolized

385
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,360
and turned into

386
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,200
bud matter and leaf matter and it is now

387
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,200
part of the plants it hasn't

388
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,440
those are the small building blocks that

389
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,959
have been metabolized and turned into

390
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:11,040
flowers leaves stems trichomes

391
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:12,078
essential oils all of the things that

392
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:13,439
are in that plant

393
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:15,759
have been kind of metabolized and

394
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:18,240
converted so i don't think

395
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:20,240
i don't know that we can actually flush

396
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,480
out a lot of that stuff i don't have

397
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,519
the right equipment the education to

398
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,120
actually know

399
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,879
what we're flushing out if we are

400
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:30,078
flushing anything out i don't know

401
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:30,799
100 that it is necessary i do know that

402
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:33,120
we had

403
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:34,000
a crop that was ran of concentrates that

404
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,679
some of the plants

405
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,120
never got flushed we didn't realize that

406
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:37,838
the harvest time was coming there was an

407
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,440
issue

408
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,360
plants got harvested they got turned

409
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,519
into concentrates we had

410
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,360
no hint that there were nutrients bad

411
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:46,480
flavors bad aromas in that concentrate

412
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,480
the concentrate was

413
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,680
[ __ ] tremendous but i haven't done

414
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,440
the side by side

415
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:53,120
with just cutting down a crop without

416
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,160
flushing it and cutting down a crop that

417
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,000
has been flushed

418
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:57,919
drying and curing them side by side and

419
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,879
smoking them i personally have not done

420
00:11:57,919 --> 00:12:02,159
that test

421
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:04,559
i am in the habit of flushing so now

422
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:06,399
uh that is kind of my rant on the pseudo

423
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:07,278
science the question the controversy of

424
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,519
flushing

425
00:12:07,278 --> 00:12:10,399
i don't know that it is necessary i like

426
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:13,120
to do it

427
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,000
uh i grow with salt and salt based

428
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,240
nutrients

429
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,759
i find it uh advantageous to flush

430
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,560
because i think i may be cleaning

431
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:20,159
something out

432
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:21,838
but then i ask myself the question what

433
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:23,838
could i possibly be

434
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,120
cleaning out those things have become

435
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:27,600
plant they're buds now

436
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,360
i'm not gonna wash out calcium out of

437
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,759
the buds there's not

438
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,278
i didn't pour the bottle of calmag into

439
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:34,879
the bud the calmag went into the

440
00:12:33,278 --> 00:12:36,879
solution which went into the roots which

441
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:39,600
got converted metabolized turned

442
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:41,439
into plants through photosynthesis uh i

443
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,320
don't know that i can flush that calmag

444
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,320
out

445
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,519
so i don't know that is that's the

446
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,839
pseudo science now

447
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:49,600
let's talk about how to flush flushing

448
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:51,200
is free that's why i'm in the habit of

449
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,759
flushing i've been taught to flush for

450
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,800
the last

451
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:56,559
10 to 14 days of my flowering cycle ah

452
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:58,879
i really liked it because it's free it's

453
00:12:56,559 --> 00:13:00,399
a really easy task to do and if it does

454
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:02,000
improve our gardens

455
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:04,078
i felt that it was something that was so

456
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,600
easy to do i should do it just in case

457
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:07,679
it did work

458
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,800
i may be missing the opportunity to give

459
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:10,719
my plants

460
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:12,159
one two maybe three more feedings over

461
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,560
that 10 to 14 days

462
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:15,360
but how much more feeding can i give

463
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:17,359
them what more

464
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,360
performance am i going to get with one

465
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,200
or two more feeds in that last 10 or 14

466
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,879
days so flushing is free

467
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,720
the way that i flush the way that i

468
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:27,759
recommend a flush is to simply

469
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,519
water your plants as normal so if

470
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:30,879
the last eight weeks of your plants

471
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,320
you've been watering and getting 20

472
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:33,278
percent runoff but you've been adding

473
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,600
nutrients

474
00:13:33,278 --> 00:13:37,360
when you begin to flush what i would do

475
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:40,000
is water to 20

476
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,959
runoff but i simply do not add nutrients

477
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,879
it's that easy

478
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:44,638
if you pour a gallon of nutrients water

479
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:46,240
through your plant on a watering day

480
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,919
when it comes time to flush pour a

481
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,759
gallon through there and don't add any

482
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:51,360
nutrients you are now flushing

483
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:53,519
the plants are the water is going to run

484
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,039
off the excess nutrients in your salt

485
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,240
in your soil and your cocoa that's all

486
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:57,439
going to run out of the bottom that will

487
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,278
be in your runoff test

488
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,560
it's in your runoff water that's not in

489
00:13:59,278 --> 00:14:02,958
the rhizosphere anymore

490
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:04,719
you are now technically you are flushing

491
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:07,439
now don't think that you need to

492
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,959
completely drain and flood your uh your

493
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,639
pot every time you flush

494
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:12,799
just a little bit of runoff every time

495
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:15,039
is sufficient we're gonna do this for

496
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:16,000
10 14 days so you're probably going to

497
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:17,599
get two

498
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,600
three maybe four or five waterings

499
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,199
depending on your cycles your pot sizes

500
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,800
uh the room so you're going to get a

501
00:14:21,198 --> 00:14:23,198
couple of waterings to just rinse them

502
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:24,399
out

503
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:26,399
we just don't want to give them

504
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,720
nutrients so just water them until you

505
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,278
get

506
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,000
10 to 20 percent runoff and do it every

507
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:33,120
day until

508
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,440
harvest then i actually don't

509
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,278
do a flush or a water about three days

510
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,199
before harvest this kind of speeds them

511
00:14:37,278 --> 00:14:40,799
up and lets them get drying a little bit

512
00:14:39,198 --> 00:14:42,399
if you need them to stay wet longer

513
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:43,679
because you're in a dry environment

514
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,519
water them right before you cut them

515
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:47,039
down think about that

516
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,320
if you water them right before you cut

517
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:50,399
them they're going to be a little bit

518
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,079
more wet in your dry and cure area

519
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:53,759
if you let them dry on the sticks

520
00:14:52,078 --> 00:14:56,799
they're going to be a little bit drier

521
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:59,120
in your dry and cure area so i flush for

522
00:14:56,799 --> 00:15:00,639
about 14 days with just plain water

523
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,639
sometimes i will add some

524
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,639
enzymes in there maybe sometimes i'll

525
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,839
add a couple of sweeteners or something

526
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,680
but for the most part

527
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:10,800
i'm just going to be flushing for the

528
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:12,799
last 10 to 14 days because it is free

529
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:14,159
and it could really improve the quality

530
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:15,759
of my product why wouldn't i do

531
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:17,360
something that's [ __ ] free

532
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:19,519
and could improve the quality now there

533
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,919
is controversy about phd

534
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,839
your flush water i work in a large

535
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:26,719
commercial environment a lot of times

536
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,199
and i think it would be an extra step to

537
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,079
ph

538
00:15:27,198 --> 00:15:30,958
adjust the 500 gallon reservoir while we

539
00:15:30,078 --> 00:15:32,958
are flushing

540
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:34,000
the reason we ph the water is because

541
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:36,879
plants uptake

542
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,278
specific nutrients at specific ph ranges

543
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:40,078
if the ph range isn't within that area

544
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:42,799
the plants won't

545
00:15:40,078 --> 00:15:44,559
uptake anything so that assists me in

546
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:46,719
flushing that rhizosphere i don't worry

547
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:48,319
about flushing or i don't worry about ph

548
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,240
when i'm flushing because i don't want

549
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,440
the plants to drink so not having a

550
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,120
dialed in ph

551
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,079
they will not drink that's what i'm

552
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,278
going for and they're going to start to

553
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:56,159
look like [ __ ] you guys were going to

554
00:15:55,278 --> 00:15:57,679
yellow them out

555
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:58,799
they're not getting any food we're

556
00:15:57,679 --> 00:15:59,838
killing them they're cannibalizing

557
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:01,120
themselves they're using all the

558
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,639
nutrients that have been stored

559
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,480
within their leaves they're feeding

560
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,000
themselves with that expect them to

561
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,639
start looking a little yellow a little

562
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,480
crispy

563
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:10,240
don't be afraid to pull off those excess

564
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:14,159
leaves get that stuff out of there

565
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:16,720
so that is how when and why i flush now

566
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:18,879
this one says how do i know when to

567
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,639
flush if a seed pack says 60 days

568
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:22,078
do i start a week before and then just

569
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:25,198
hope it's done around 60

570
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:28,799
days if the seed pack says

571
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:30,078
60 days i would go 70. like i said in my

572
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:32,479
previous rant

573
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:34,000
you don't know what phenotype you've got

574
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,600
the breeder doesn't know what may be

575
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,360
going on in your environment with your

576
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,320
nutrients you may have a phenotype that

577
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,560
wants to go

578
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,079
a few extra days let it go that few

579
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:43,919
extra days and see maybe it'll do

580
00:16:42,078 --> 00:16:45,120
something amazing you'll never know if

581
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:47,679
you don't let it go

582
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,839
so if it says 60 days on the package my

583
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:52,479
recommendation is to let it go 70 days

584
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:53,199
at least 67 days let it go that extra

585
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,639
week

586
00:16:53,198 --> 00:16:56,240
i know that sounds crazy because you're

587
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,278
a grower that wants to get that crop

588
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,680
down you want to get it

589
00:16:57,278 --> 00:17:02,000
harvested dried cured so you can either

590
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:05,119
smoke it or make your profit off of it

591
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,798
but that extra week could really

592
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:08,399
increase your harvest weight really

593
00:17:06,798 --> 00:17:09,599
increase your potency it could make your

594
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,038
product stand out

595
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:13,038
to where you can actually sell it for a

596
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:15,119
little extra more money or you can smoke

597
00:17:13,038 --> 00:17:17,038
it and enjoy it just a little bit better

598
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,879
so give it that extra week to 10 days

599
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:21,199
the first time you grow it just to see

600
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,280
what happens that is my recommendation

601
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,480
i always go a little bit longer when i

602
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:26,959
have a new strain

603
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:29,279
just to see what it may do so if the

604
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:32,240
package says 60 days my advice

605
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:33,918
goes 67 to 70 days maybe even longer if

606
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,519
you can risk it if you can push it

607
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,360
if you can hold back it's you that you

608
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:38,879
got to do it's patience on your part

609
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:41,119
you're the one in control of everything

610
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:44,240
so i would say go 70 days

611
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:46,319
and then begin your flush at day 60.

612
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,759
now take notes at this time i don't know

613
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:49,519
if you've got any clones of this i don't

614
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:52,160
know if you're just running one plant

615
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:53,119
but run that 70 days and take notes see

616
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,038
what it was like

617
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:56,558
start watching the trichomes around day

618
00:17:55,038 --> 00:18:01,038
55 get a loop

619
00:17:56,558 --> 00:18:02,960
check them out at 55 60 63 65

620
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:04,640
70 pay really close really close

621
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:07,200
attention to those trichomes

622
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,320
then at day 70 cut it down something to

623
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,519
think about is

624
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:13,200
hopefully this is not your first date

625
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:14,480
with this plan this is not going to or

626
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,000
not your last date sorry

627
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,960
i hear a weird noise i'm distracted by a

628
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,919
weird noise in the background i don't

629
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,279
know what the hell it is i really hope

630
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,280
it's not coming through the microphone

631
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:22,399
doesn't sound like it is but hopefully

632
00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:24,639
this is not your

633
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,679
last date with this plan hopefully this

634
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,520
is your first date

635
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,960
so this is your kinda you're just going

636
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:29,519
out for dinner the first time getting to

637
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,759
know her

638
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:32,798
you gotta dial this plant in you've gone

639
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:34,640
70 days

640
00:18:32,798 --> 00:18:37,279
take three or four clones run like four

641
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:40,000
clones next time cut one down at day 60

642
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:41,119
one at day 63 one at day 65 and one at

643
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,359
day 70.

644
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:45,519
dry and cure them all the same smoke

645
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:47,279
them see which one you desire the most

646
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:50,400
and then in subsequent grows

647
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:52,000
cut them down at that day but

648
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,679
people think that this first time they

649
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,558
grow this plant they've got to get it

650
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:56,480
perfect

651
00:18:54,558 --> 00:18:57,839
you'll get it right you'll get it good

652
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,440
but the second third

653
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:01,279
fourth time you grow this plant that's

654
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,798
when you really get it dialed in that's

655
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:04,639
when we really start getting

656
00:19:02,798 --> 00:19:06,960
uh the nuances of that plant you'll

657
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:09,520
start realizing oh it wants to go

658
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,960
64 days and the last two days it wants

659
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:13,279
it really really cold

660
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,798
and also around week five it would have

661
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:16,480
really liked it if i would have added a

662
00:19:14,798 --> 00:19:18,000
little bit more calcium

663
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,919
and gone a little bit lighter on the

664
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,519
phosphorus like you just got to grow

665
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:23,360
them a few times and learn them it's

666
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:24,000
like taking this plant out on several

667
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:26,479
dates except

668
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,880
your dates are really really long for

669
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:32,400
like 90 day cycles for each date

670
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:34,240
so um hopefully this is not your last

671
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,919
run with this plan it's just your first

672
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,599
run you've got to learn the plan you're

673
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,480
going to learn a lot about it every time

674
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:40,000
you grow it

675
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,000
you're going to see you're going to have

676
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,759
things happen in the grow that tell you

677
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,919
what this plant likes maybe

678
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:47,440
like right now it's real cold if i've

679
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,880
been running this plant in the summer

680
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,640
several times and never gave it the

681
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:53,120
opportunity to get real cold

682
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,640
i just happen to get negative 17 maybe

683
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:56,239
i'm going to see different things from

684
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,600
my plants in my garden because of that

685
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,919
negative 17.

686
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:01,519
so run it a few times learn the plants

687
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,038
see exactly what it likes

688
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:05,119
then you'll know i got to get it real

689
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:06,319
cold i got to give it a real high or

690
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:07,918
real low ph

691
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:09,759
just things like that you'll learn them

692
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:10,480
with different growth so dial it in over

693
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:12,879
time

694
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,798
uh then the next time you grow it take

695
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,480
multiple cuts of that same plant

696
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:17,839
treat it all the same all the way

697
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,919
through the grow except

698
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:20,879
flush harvest and dry and cure at

699
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:22,159
different times

700
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,919
and then you can really tell the

701
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,799
difference in what you're getting from

702
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:26,960
your different

703
00:20:24,798 --> 00:20:28,480
flushing harvesting drying and curing

704
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:31,200
intervals so

705
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,640
um i know that doesn't sound like the

706
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,400
answer you wanted because you didn't

707
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,320
want to hear that you should grow to 70

708
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:39,440
days you wanted me to say it day 55

709
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:41,200
flush it cut it down at 60 but

710
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,720
from a grower with a lot of experience

711
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,080
somebody who's really looking to get the

712
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,159
most out of my garden

713
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:47,599
i would run that plant for 70 days and

714
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,760
flush it at day 60

715
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:50,798
and see what you get in the end then on

716
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:53,359
your second run

717
00:20:50,798 --> 00:20:54,960
do multiple clones of the same plant run

718
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:58,558
them at multiple different times

719
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:00,079
60 65 70 see which one you like the best

720
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:02,639
don't worry that you're going to ruin

721
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:06,319
the crop by going a little bit too long

722
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:08,000
you can start flushing at day 55 if you

723
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:09,599
want to just to be prepared

724
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,960
and then keep an eye on those trichomes

725
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:12,240
if you think they're getting too amber

726
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,159
then cut it down

727
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,440
but i don't think you're going to over

728
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:17,120
ripen these plants

729
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,279
there's a nice window of ripeness you

730
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:20,719
get a few days it's not like you have to

731
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:23,038
cut them at day 62

732
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,319
or you're gonna [ __ ] it up i run big

733
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:27,200
commercial grows

734
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:28,158
and we can't let one plant dictate the

735
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,840
whole room

736
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:33,760
uh the room is coming down on march 17th

737
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:35,439
and that's when it comes down we've got

738
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:37,359
a bunch of plants in there that run nine

739
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:40,000
weeks we do a nine week cycle

740
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:41,918
march 17th will be the end of nine weeks

741
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,679
all of those plants are coming down

742
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:45,759
some of them yes should have probably

743
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,440
came down around march

744
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:49,038
14th some of them probably could have

745
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,038
come down around the 15th some of them

746
00:21:49,038 --> 00:21:53,440
need to go till the 21st

747
00:21:51,038 --> 00:21:54,960
but that's such a nice middle ground

748
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,600
right there that i think all the plants

749
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,000
come out

750
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:59,519
they're just they're not amazing they're

751
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,359
not [ __ ] stellar but they're

752
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:03,119
just right to where all of the plants

753
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:05,199
agree that that nine week mark

754
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:06,639
works for us so on the commercial grow

755
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,080
they come down at nine weeks we don't

756
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,600
[ __ ] around with that extra two or three

757
00:22:08,079 --> 00:22:11,759
days letting some [ __ ] grow

758
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:13,759
cutting [ __ ] early uh we just chop them

759
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:15,119
so we start flushing about 10 days

760
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:16,480
before there we're in cocoa

761
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:17,918
so we only have to flush for about 10

762
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,038
days put some enzymes in there it cleans

763
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:22,000
them out real good

764
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:23,359
anyway i'm getting off track my point um

765
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,440
start flushing about

766
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:27,119
60 days take a lot of notes pay

767
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,200
attention to how the plants react

768
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:31,119
try them cure them see how you smoke it

769
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,279
see how you enjoy it the next time

770
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:34,239
do multiple cultivars multiple cuts of

771
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:35,759
the same plant

772
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,440
cut them down at different times at

773
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:38,480
different intervals and see which one

774
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,440
works best

775
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,000
for you or your clientele or customers

776
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,400

777
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,359

00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:24,319
but now he is starting to use eagle 20

832
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:26,558
and abamectin as a preventative measure

833
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:28,240
um terrible products i would not allow

834
00:24:26,558 --> 00:24:29,918
recommend and doris condone or promote

835
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,400
the use of those products at all

836
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:32,960
that's where this message gets good it

837
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,640
says

838
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,240
uh we've never had a powdery mildew

839
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,120
issue and little to no bugs in our

840
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,798
garden

841
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:40,399
but now he is starting to use but

842
00:24:38,798 --> 00:24:42,240
monthly sprays

843
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,840
we have but we've never had any uh

844
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,038
powdery mildew and little to no bugs in

845
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:46,319
our garden so they're starting to use

846
00:24:45,038 --> 00:24:47,679
powder eagle 20

847
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:50,558
even though they've never had powdery

848
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:52,720
mildew or any big bug issues

849
00:24:50,558 --> 00:24:55,200
it says monthly sprays of future death

850
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:57,200
for the consumers what the [ __ ]

851
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,759
i completely agree with you bro that is

852
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,919
not a good product

853
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:03,038
that's not good morals good ethics i'm

854
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:04,799
gonna keep reading though it says what

855
00:25:03,038 --> 00:25:07,359
the [ __ ] this has made me start my own

856
00:25:04,798 --> 00:25:09,839
garden and leave his garden

857
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:11,359
um i hate to say problem solved but

858
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:12,798
problem solved man you can only worry

859
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:13,599
about yourself you can only do what you

860
00:25:12,798 --> 00:25:15,278
can do

861
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:16,959
he's going to do his thing if you've

862
00:25:15,278 --> 00:25:18,159
separated yourself from him

863
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,840
you know you're doing the right thing

864
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:20,480
basically problem solved but there is

865
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:23,439
more

866
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,839
it says i know that is bad [ __ ] real

867
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,679
real

868
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:27,678
bad [ __ ] yes it is real bad [ __ ] it's

869
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:29,038
toxic it's not good for the plants not

870
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:29,759
good for the environment not good for

871
00:25:29,038 --> 00:25:31,919
the

872
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:32,798
applicator not good for the consumer and

873
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:34,720
honestly not

874
00:25:32,798 --> 00:25:36,639
necessary for the cannabis plants

875
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,319
there's much more to this it says

876
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,480
him and i have argued about using these

877
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:42,158
chemicals i cannot be a part of that my

878
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,919
dilemma is what to do

879
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:45,679
with that knowledge i don't want to be a

880
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:47,840
rat but come on man

881
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:50,320
yeah you can't be a rat uh we're in this

882
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:52,319
game uh this is a [ __ ] game where

883
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:54,079
snitches get stitches you cannot be a

884
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:55,200
rat no matter what it's about snitching

885
00:25:54,079 --> 00:25:56,639
is snitching so

886
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,480
you can't be a snitch you've just got to

887
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,520
be the best man that you can be about

888
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,640
this situation

889
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:02,720
and that's what you're doing you're

890
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,000
getting away from a terrible situation

891
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,278
you know someone's doing wrong you don't

892
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,038
want to be involved in it so you've

893
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:08,480
separated yourself from it

894
00:26:07,038 --> 00:26:10,158
in this type of situation that's

895
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,000
probably the best we can do

896
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:13,200
there's more though it says this is free

897
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,200
market cannabis

898
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,960
so testing is not required i'm gonna go

899
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,798
off on a rant here it makes me

900
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,640
laugh when people say uh that they

901
00:26:18,798 --> 00:26:22,240
prefer black market cannabis because you

902
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,000
don't find powdery mildew

903
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,440
and you don't find pesticides in black

904
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,640
market cannabis of course you don't it

905
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,400
wasn't tested

906
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:31,759
uh so how do you even know that there

907
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,759
were pesticides or

908
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:34,959
mold or whatever in your black market

909
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:36,719
cannabis they say yeah that dispensary

910
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,960
weed is moldy and doesn't pass testing

911
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,839
yeah the black market stuff will too

912
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,880
because it doesn't have to get tested

913
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:44,158
all right that's just my

914
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,559
my side rant we're going to keep going

915
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:48,240
let me find where i was uh i think i

916
00:26:46,558 --> 00:26:49,918
know where you stand on these cancer

917
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,159
causing products but what would you do

918
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:53,360
with the knowledge of what he is doing

919
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:55,039
i'm going to talk about that here it

920
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:57,038
says sorry for the ridiculous length of

921
00:26:55,038 --> 00:26:58,640
the email but having lost my parents

922
00:26:57,038 --> 00:27:01,200
grandparents and countless others to

923
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:03,200
cancer i feel pretty strongly about this

924
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,960
ah that's a [ __ ] understandable

925
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,480
stance right there bro i understand that

926
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,840

my big boy balls would still be in my

930
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:14,879
girl's purse

931
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:16,240
and i wouldn't have dared to expand my

932
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,080
own garden i love that

933
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:20,159

934
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:21,439
courage and uh

935
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:23,200
just the knowledge and courage i guess

936
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,640
to get your balls out of the purse and

937
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,240

congratulations bro sounds like you got

939
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,440
a cool lady also

940
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:31,278
uh then it says from your friend and

941
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,919
then he actually says you can use my

942
00:27:31,278 --> 00:27:34,000
real name

943
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:35,278
nobody believes in real names anyways

944
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,640
then he backed that up with hey bro

945
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:37,839
actually my name's kind of unique don't

946
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,960
use my real name so

947
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:40,398
we're not going to use your real name

948
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,079
we'll keep you safe here bro hopefully

949
00:27:40,398 --> 00:27:43,839
your ex grow partner doesn't hear this

950
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:47,359
and doesn't get upset with you

951
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:48,959
um you know how i feel about this dude

952
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:50,879
eagle 20 is a terrible product that's

953
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,960
the product that you listed here mainly

954
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,320
uh they got my attention eagle 20 is

955
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,159
banned in

956
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:57,918
commercial cultivation in the state of

957
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:59,600
colorado it is banned by the colorado

958
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:00,559
department of agriculture for several

959
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:03,038
reasons

960
00:28:00,558 --> 00:28:04,639
first of all uh it does not go away it's

961
00:28:03,038 --> 00:28:06,558
on the plants forever once you put that

962
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,399
on the plants it stays

963
00:28:06,558 --> 00:28:10,480
second of all it's very toxic to the

964
00:28:08,398 --> 00:28:13,759
applicator and the consumer

965
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:16,000
third uh if the fire department

966
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:17,839
has to come and the building is on fire

967
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,599
they don't want us having equal 20 in

968
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:22,720
the building because when it burns

969
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:25,278
it turns into cyanide gas which

970
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:27,360
doesn't sound good to me at all so eagle

971
00:28:25,278 --> 00:28:29,919
20 is a very terrible product

972
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:30,719
also if you have to use eagle 20 in the

973
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:32,799
grow

974
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:35,440
you're being [ __ ] lazy you said there

975
00:28:32,798 --> 00:28:36,879
are no powdery mildew or bug problems

976
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,720
what the [ __ ] are you using powdery

977
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:41,919
mildew for if you don't have any bug

978
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,640
or mildew problems this is a lazy man's

979
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:44,399
product

980
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,320
this product is designed for people who

981
00:28:44,398 --> 00:28:47,759
don't know how to adjust vpd

982
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:49,359
who don't know how to do preventative

983
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:50,240
maintenance who don't know how to set up

984
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:51,759
a grow room

985
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,599
and watch a monitor and make sure that

986
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:56,240
your vpd is in range

987
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:56,798
this is just a lazy man's product it's

988
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:00,319
also

989
00:28:56,798 --> 00:29:02,639
a greedy careless man's product uh

990
00:29:00,319 --> 00:29:05,200
cannabis is meant to make us feel better

991
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:08,080
and uh we rely on our grower

992
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:10,319
our cultivator to produce a clean

993
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:13,439
reliable ethical product

994
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:15,519
uh by being a grower who sprays stuff

995
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,200
like eagle 20 on it you're not being an

996
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:17,759
ethical grower you're being a greedy

997
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,679
grower

998
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:21,440
who is not thinking about the health or

999
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:24,000
well-being of your consumer

1000
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,798
and most of the time cannabis sales

1001
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,240
people

1002
00:29:24,798 --> 00:29:27,599
hang out with the people who consume

1003
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,960
their products you come by you sit on

1004
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:30,798
the couch you play some video games

1005
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:33,440
smoke a couple bong rips together

1006
00:29:30,798 --> 00:29:35,200
you act like your friends you act like

1007
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,720
you care about those people but

1008
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,319
if you're spraying their medicine their

1009
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,919
product with eagle 20

1010
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:41,278
you don't care about them you are not

1011
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:42,640
their friend this is supposed to be a

1012
00:29:41,278 --> 00:29:43,519
medical product i don't care if you're

1013
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,159
smoking it

1014
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:48,480
recreationally or medically this is a

1015
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:50,640
medical product it makes our body feel

1016
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,000
different it should make you feel better

1017
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,440
spraying eagle 20 on

1018
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,919
on a product you're giving to somebody

1019
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:58,399
to prevent cancer is bad karma

1020
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:59,278
it's lazy it's [ __ ] greedy you're not

1021
00:29:58,398 --> 00:30:00,879
thinking about

1022
00:29:59,278 --> 00:30:02,880
your product you're not thinking about

1023
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:05,440
your friends your customers your patient

1024
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,880
you're thinking about your wallet and

1025
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:09,278
that's a [ __ ] up way to go about

1026
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:11,520
cannabis yes i run a cannabis business

1027
00:30:09,278 --> 00:30:13,440
but i give you a lot for free i grow

1028
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:15,440
from my heart i teach you how to succeed

1029
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:17,759
with the products that i do offer you

1030
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,558
i don't feel that there's a need for

1031
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:20,879
laziness

1032
00:30:18,558 --> 00:30:22,000
for greed for a big old ego for

1033
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,679
carelessness in the

1034
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,759
garden and those are the things that

1035
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:27,200
come with applying eagle 20 that's a big

1036
00:30:25,759 --> 00:30:27,839
sign that says you don't care about the

1037
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,600
people

1038
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:31,119
you don't care about the products and

1039
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:32,879
like i said a moment ago you don't care

1040
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:34,798
about your friends and your community

1041
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,399
because these people come to your spot

1042
00:30:34,798 --> 00:30:38,240
and they probably take bong rips with

1043
00:30:36,398 --> 00:30:38,719
you you probably hang out at the park

1044
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,319
with them

1045
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,319
they probably know your family and

1046
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:43,038
friends you probably know their family

1047
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:44,079
and friends

1048
00:30:43,038 --> 00:30:46,079
and then you're going to see them all

1049
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:47,359
start coughing they're starting

1050
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:48,960
they're going to start feeling weird

1051
00:30:47,359 --> 00:30:50,240
they're going to start changing colors

1052
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,679
weird symptoms are going to start

1053
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,120
popping up because they've been smoking

1054
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:55,600
product that is tainted

1055
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:57,359
with illegal pesticides pesticides that

1056
00:30:55,599 --> 00:31:00,558
i would not even allow in my

1057
00:30:57,359 --> 00:31:03,839
grow and my home that are unnecessary so

1058
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:05,038
um that's enough of a rant on the

1059
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:07,199
terrible morals

1060
00:31:05,038 --> 00:31:09,119
and [ __ ] laziness of your friend who

1061
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,720
calls themselves a grower

1062
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:12,879
they are failing and they know it

1063
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:15,120
they're just being greedy so

1064
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:17,278
this is a good sign and a good reason

1065
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:18,879
for you to just simply let him go

1066
00:31:17,278 --> 00:31:20,398
you can if you want i'm not giving you

1067
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,360
life advice but i'm giving you life

1068
00:31:20,398 --> 00:31:23,278
advice

1069
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:24,479
the way somebody does something is the

1070
00:31:23,278 --> 00:31:26,640
way somebody does

1071
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:28,319
everything and if this guy is spraying

1072
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:30,960
[ __ ] on his plants

1073
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:32,639
behind his customers back what else is

1074
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:34,079
he doing to you and your friends your

1075
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,720
family and your customers what other

1076
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:36,879
kind of

1077
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,240
morals and ethics does this guy have

1078
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,200
that he's kind of bending when you're

1079
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,519
not looking

1080
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:43,038
is this somebody that you want to be

1081
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:45,120
friends with is that somebody you want

1082
00:31:43,038 --> 00:31:46,158
on your team can you rely on this person

1083
00:31:45,119 --> 00:31:48,079
as a friend

1084
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:49,440
or are they just greedy with you and

1085
00:31:48,079 --> 00:31:52,398
your friendship in your life

1086
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:54,159
also so he's also doing more filthy [ __ ]

1087
00:31:52,398 --> 00:31:55,678
to his customers and to his friends and

1088
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:58,000
to you that you don't know about

1089
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:59,360
is my assumption i can't prove that i

1090
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,119
don't know that i don't know the dude

1091
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:03,759
but most of the time the way somebody

1092
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:05,599
does something is the way somebody does

1093
00:32:03,759 --> 00:32:07,519
everything and if he's doing this [ __ ]

1094
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:10,240
greedily selfishly

1095
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:11,679
lazily without care that's how he's

1096
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,960
probably going to do a lot of things and

1097
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:14,320
that will continue

1098
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,159
through his life and that will also

1099
00:32:14,319 --> 00:32:17,200
spill into your friendship your

1100
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:19,360
relationship

1101
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,558
and your future now don't let this guy

1102
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:22,398
bring you down

1103
00:32:20,558 --> 00:32:24,558
don't attach yourself to him business

1104
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:26,000
wise because once the clientele finds

1105
00:32:24,558 --> 00:32:27,278
out that he's been spraying [ __ ] on it

1106
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,798
if you're still attached

1107
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:30,319
they're going to think that you're doing

1108
00:32:28,798 --> 00:32:33,599
it too so

1109
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:35,439
he will uh he will rid himself

1110
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:36,798
of his own problem his clients will

1111
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,600
realize that something's wrong with the

1112
00:32:36,798 --> 00:32:39,519
product

1113
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:40,798
or what will happen is you will get the

1114
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:43,120
good the good

1115
00:32:40,798 --> 00:32:44,960
clientele people can tell who's got the

1116
00:32:43,119 --> 00:32:46,719
good vibes who's got the good scruples

1117
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,240
the good morals the good ethics

1118
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,079
and they can feel that in you and they

1119
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,679
can feel that in him and if you guys

1120
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:53,359
divide as team

1121
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:55,200
members if you guys divide as sales

1122
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:56,240
people i don't know your dynamic but if

1123
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,240
it is divided

1124
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,679
and it is kind of it becomes known

1125
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,440
amongst your community that it has been

1126
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:02,080
divided people will see that that has

1127
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,278
happened

1128
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:04,798
people will make their own thought

1129
00:33:03,278 --> 00:33:06,480
processes and they'll say you know what

1130
00:33:04,798 --> 00:33:07,918
this guy seems like a good guy

1131
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:10,079
he must not be hanging out with this guy

1132
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:11,200
over here for a reason that guy will end

1133
00:33:10,079 --> 00:33:13,119
up with all of the

1134
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:15,038
[ __ ] nefarious customers all of the

1135
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:16,000
riffraff all the [ __ ] customers will

1136
00:33:15,038 --> 00:33:17,679
end up over there

1137
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,440
you'll have all the good clientele all

1138
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:20,798
the good customers all the good people

1139
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,759
that care about each other they care

1140
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:23,200
about karma

1141
00:33:21,759 --> 00:33:24,720
he'll have all the [ __ ] over there

1142
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,640
all the people that you kind of needed

1143
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,679
to distance yourself from anyway they'll

1144
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:30,960
all go there

1145
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:32,960
this may be a blessing in disguise

1146
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,480
or as my friend saul says could be a

1147
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:37,278
blessing in the skies

1148
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:39,599
however you want to say it but this may

1149
00:33:37,278 --> 00:33:41,839
be uh the thing that you needed

1150
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:43,839
to separate yourself from some [ __ ]

1151
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:44,639
before you got too deep into some

1152
00:33:43,839 --> 00:33:46,558
[ __ ]

1153
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,840
uh now you can get away get out of it

1154
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:49,038
you guys can start your own thing now

1155
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:50,158
you don't have to split the profit with

1156
00:33:49,038 --> 00:33:53,278
anybody else

1157
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:55,039
um maybe that's the route to take and

1158
