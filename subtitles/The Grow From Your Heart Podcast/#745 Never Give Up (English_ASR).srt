foresight the forethought the the

53
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,640
awareness to wait an extra week before i

54
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:19,679
put my plants out but i am excited to

55
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:21,598

56
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,599
in a greenhouse i do have a greenhouse

57
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:25,759

63
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,680
i am super excited i've got some plants

64
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:39,359
in a greenhouse this year that's as

65
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,040
close to outdoor as i get i don't do a

66
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,280
lot of outdoor but the greenhouse is

67
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:45,840
ideal it's in a great location nobody

68
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,959
knows where it is that is perfect for me

69
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,878
nobody even knows that there's a

70
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,878
greenhouse there it is beautiful so i've

71
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:52,318
got a greenhouse set up with

72
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:54,000
some beautiful plants in there they're

73
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:55,759
not very big now but by the end of the

74
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,080
season they will be monstrous and they

75
00:02:55,759 --> 00:03:00,719
will be filled with a lot of magnificent

76
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,040
seeds so here's a big tease stay tuned

77
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:05,680
for future episodes i will talk a lot

78
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:08,799
about the greenhouse and the progress

79
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,560
over time i will reveal the plants that

80
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,480
are in there maybe in the very near

81
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,080
future i will tell you what male plant i

82
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:15,759
have put in there because that will make

83
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,080
a big difference it's not a male plant

84
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:20,158
that you're used to me using often um so

85
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,680
i've already said too much let's jump

86
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:23,679
into this email i did say i was going to

87
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,000
answer an email from a friend i'm not

88
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:29,040
playing with my phone here this message

89
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,318
is on my phone's screen let me find it i

90
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:31,679
did have it right here but then of

91
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:34,158
course you know the iphone does that

92
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,000
thing it goes a lot like this it says

93
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:38,239
i've got a question it says what's up

94
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,878
ross to jeff at what point would you

95
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,719
recommend someone throw in the towel on

96
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:44,318
growing it sounds like our friend is

97
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:46,158
having a frustrating time in the grow

98
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:48,238
room but it goes on it says i've been

99
00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:50,560
growing for half of my life and honestly

100
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,878
i'm unable to produce anything that

101
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,400
makes me proud i'm embarrassed if

102
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:55,919
anything

103
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,400
that's got to be a frustrating position

104
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:59,679
to be in and i'm sure that together with

105
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,000
a little bit of patience a little bit of

106
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,599
work we can definitely uh improve your

107
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,438
garden it will take patience and time

108
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:08,079
and some effort but i've got some ideas

109
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:09,919
some steps some plans uh a solution to

110
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,000
help you improve the grow

111
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:13,839
it says the next grow i've been saying

112
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,120
for 18 years that the next grow is going

113
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:19,358
to be the one at what point is it insane

114
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,560
to keep repeating the same failure again

115
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:24,079
and again to produce mids every time

116
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,918
then they give their name and they say

117
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:27,680
uh sincerely thank you bro thank you for

118
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:29,039
the great message i don't know if this

119
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,199
was meant to be for the show but you've

120
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,600
sent me a lot of great content this was

121
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,040
my first favorite message that i wanted

122
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,400
to use on the show keep sending me the

123
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,800
great content you do have a lot of great

124
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:40,159
ideas this one is going to go straight

125
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,319
to the show the part that got my

126
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,479
attention here was at what point is it

127
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:46,639
insane to keep repeating the same

128
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:48,399
failure again and again uh repeating the

129
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,240
same failure again and again is insane

130
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:51,758
once or twice i'll give you like i gotta

131
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,040
try it again maybe it was a fluke try it

132
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,560
again you notice some shit's wrong if

133
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,759
you do it a third time that's when i'm

134
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,319
gonna start saying that you got some

135
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:00,479
issues what we need to do

136
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:01,439
is not keep doing the same thing over

137
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:03,199
and over it sounds like you've been

138
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:05,519
doing the same thing for 18 years and

139
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:08,160
it's not working now is the time to

140
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:10,000
assess the situation see what is working

141
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,360
see what is not working i do have a list

142
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,639
of stuff here on my computer screen that

143
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,240
i'm going to get to

144
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,478
um

145
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,400
i think it is time to find the weakness

146
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:20,000
where is your weak point what are you

147
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:22,079
not doing what are you not really good

148
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,240
at where is it going wrong at what point

149
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:26,240
in the grow are you noticing that things

150
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,600
are not up to your expectations if

151
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,600
you're looking

152
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,600
maybe it's not really good to compare

153
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,080
your grow to other growers on social

154
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,639
media your friends grows on the discord

155
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:38,879
server but at the same time a lot of

156
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:41,120
people are watching their friends grow

157
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:42,879
uh their grow me's grow on social media

158
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,959
they're saying i'm at week four a veg

159
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:46,879
and my plants look like this if yours

160
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:48,799
are much smaller much more spindly less

161
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:50,879
healthy maybe there's something you're

162
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,639
lacking that other person is doing then

163
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:54,478
we get into flour if we're comparing our

164
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,079
plants and we see that this guy's way

165
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:57,918
further along and has bigger juicier

166
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:59,439
buds and we're just getting bud set

167
00:05:57,918 --> 00:06:01,359
maybe we can see that we're not up to

168
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:02,478
the standard maybe we could be but don't

169
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,720
make it a

170
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:06,560
too much of a habit to compare yourself

171
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,000
to others for your success it is a good

172
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,680
guideline to kind of see what others are

173
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,439
doing and you can see if you're keeping

174
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,199
up but don't make it the template don't

175
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:15,360
make it the expectation

176
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,720
but is a good way to see where do you

177
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,240
fall off

178
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,360
do your plants look like your friends

179
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,680
your partners

180
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,840
the communities grow at week two events

181
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,680
week three week four week five how about

182
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:27,359
week six do they look to the same then

183
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,759
when you go into flower when do they

184
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,080
stop looking good to you when do you see

185
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:34,720
the problem happening so let's find the

186
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:36,000
weakness that we are lacking

187
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,520
you might already know where you're

188
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,918
lacking you may already be able to

189
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:41,839
identify the problem the time frame

190
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:43,839
about this time frame things start going

191
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:45,439
wrong and i'm not as happy as i could be

192
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:47,918
maybe you already know that but let's

193
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:50,240
pay attention let's do another cycle and

194
00:06:47,918 --> 00:06:52,560
take a lot of notes

195
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,639
let's build a standard operating

196
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,759
procedure let's build a process let's

197
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:59,598
develop a streamlined flow let's have a

198
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,439
reason and a purpose for everything that

199
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:03,519
we're doing in that grow and while we

200
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:05,439
are doing it let's document it let's

201
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:07,680
take notes let's make documentation so

202
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:09,360
that we know what we are doing so if we

203
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,038
have a great outcome

204
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,120
we've got an sop we've got a standard

205
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:14,959
operating procedure of what to repeat if

206
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,879
we get a terrible outcome we've got an

207
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:18,399
sop of what not to do and we can look at

208
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:20,240
that and say well this [ __ ] didn't work

209
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:21,758
and you've got some sort of a map some

210
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,038
sort of data i don't know if you're

211
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,560
doing that right now but that would be

212
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:27,360
one of the things i really recommend is

213
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:30,319
start taking a lot of notes so find the

214
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,240
weakness in your grow is it a process is

215
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:35,120
it a system that you are doing or is it

216
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:37,280
simply a product or a piece of equipment

217
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,280
without really good lighting your plants

218
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:40,879
are never going to be the top quality

219
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:42,239
plants that they could be you've got to

220
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:43,598
get either

221
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,560
there are so many options available for

222
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:45,918
lighting i'm not even going to talk

223
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,240
about it get the best light that your

224
00:07:45,918 --> 00:07:49,519
money can afford for your situation

225
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,439
there are a lot of options when it comes

226
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:52,799
to lighting if you've got a high ceiling

227
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:55,598
get a more powerful light if you've got

228
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,120
a low ceiling get more low power lights

229
00:07:55,598 --> 00:07:58,719
and spread them out a little bit you

230
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,199
have a lot of options get the best light

231
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,360
you can afford then air how is the

232
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,720
airflow in your grow are you exchanging

233
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,639
air you're getting fresh air in there is

234
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,800
there air movement how's the temperature

235
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,720
how's the humidity or is the air dialed

236
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,439
in so you got the lights we got the air

237
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,120
how's the water are you giving them good

238
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:16,639
water which includes nutrients what are

239
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,160
you feeding these plants are you buying

240
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,079
the bottom of the barrel cheapest [ __ ]

241
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,919
you can get and feeding it very little

242
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:23,279
so you can get by or are you buying the

243
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:25,038
best [ __ ] that money can buy and

244
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:27,038
maximizing it pushing those plants to

245
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:29,279
their full potential that's up to you so

246
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:31,759
we got lights get the best lights get

247
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:33,278
the air fixed uh get air flow get the

248
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,038
temperature get the humidity get some

249
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:37,278
wind don't have any micro climates get

250
00:08:35,038 --> 00:08:38,479
all that stuff dialed in your water uh

251
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:40,158
do you have the right nutrients the

252
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:43,839
right amount of nutrients at the right

253
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:45,439
time is your ph correct ah lights air

254
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,920
water how about your soil what are you

255
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:50,240
growing in are you using cocoa using

256
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:52,159
soil soilless mix are you growing in

257
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,480
straight clay pebbles are you going in

258
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:56,559
rock wool cubes what are you doing there

259
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:59,440
is that dialed in are you over watering

260
00:08:56,559 --> 00:09:01,278
are you under watering is your ph right

261
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,440
is your soil drying up too much is your

262
00:09:01,278 --> 00:09:05,360
soil staying too wet are your rock wool

263
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,120
cubes getting moldy there are so many

264
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,200
things to think about there

265
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,440
so let's get the basics dialed in the

266
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,800
lights the air the water the soil the

267
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,959
next thing i'm going to talk about of

268
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:16,479
course is a seed breeder is genetics

269
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:18,879
have you been growing a genetic that

270
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,200
does not have a quality potential some

271
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:24,000
plants will only get so good other

272
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,440
plants will get so good it's all about

273
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,278
the genetics and i'm not just saying

274
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,959
that because i'm a seed breeder i'm not

275
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:30,639
the only breeder out there making

276
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:33,039
amazing genetics there are a lot of

277
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:35,278
great genetics maybe it's time to spend

278
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:36,719
a few bucks and get some better genetics

279
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:38,240
maybe you need a better light maybe you

280
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,160
need better air flow maybe you need a

281
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,839
better air setup maybe you need better

282
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:44,079
water maybe you need a better medium

283
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:46,080
maybe you need better genetics then if

284
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,920
all that stuff is dialed in that's when

285
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,879
we start talking about the actual

286
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:52,639
process of the grow even if you've got

287
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:54,320
the best race car on the planet you

288
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:55,838
can't win the race if you don't know how

289
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,278
to grow if you don't even know how to

290
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:58,800
turn on the engine and shift that [ __ ]

291
00:09:57,278 --> 00:10:00,799
into gear you're not getting off the

292
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:03,120
starting line so let's start with the

293
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:06,240
best equipment we can get then let's get

294
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:08,159
a very good grow procedure down by this

295
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,000
time you've been growing for 18 years

296
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:12,240
you should have a decent understanding

297
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,320
of this plant you understand uh how to

298
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,440
cut clones the veg cycle the flowering

299
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,680
cycle you should have a good

300
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:20,079
understanding of the basics i would

301
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:22,399
almost run a crop the way that you do it

302
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:24,399
and take a lot of notes then look at it

303
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,919
and see where did it go wrong where do

304
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,759
you notice the plants aren't performing

305
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:30,000
up to your expectation

306
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:32,159
then just like anything in life identify

307
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,159
the problem and then think of a solution

308
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:36,240
how can we improve and correct this

309
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:38,399
problem how can we solve this what is

310
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,159
the solution how do we move forward so

311
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:42,879
identify the weakness identify the

312
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:44,879
problem then let's find a way to improve

313
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:46,240
upon that are you

314
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:47,360
so i'm going to ramble i've got a couple

315
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,120
of different thought

316
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,759
processes and patterns i want to go down

317
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,360
here first off are your mother plants

318
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:55,838
healthy are you starting off with

319
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,680
healthy mother stock then do you know

320
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,519
how to take healthy clothes is there two

321
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:01,439
thought processes are the plants healthy

322
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,440
that you're beginning with then do you

323
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,440
know how to create healthy clones do you

324
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,959
know how to create healthy veg plants do

325
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,200
you know how to transition those healthy

326
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:11,278
veg plants into flower do you know how

327
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,320
to keep pests and pathogens away do you

328
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:13,838
know how to

329
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,920
optimize the room do you know how to

330
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:17,519
dial in the space learn how to treat

331
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:18,719
that plant exactly how it needs to be

332
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,240
treated

333
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,879
maybe learn a little bit more about

334
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:25,120
identifying deficiencies and overfeeding

335
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:26,879
and underwatering and temperature issues

336
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,919
start identifying what the plant is

337
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:31,519
telling you we rely a lot on equipment a

338
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:33,278
lot of times the plant will be sitting

339
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:35,200
right over there in the grow room and we

340
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:37,600
will be staring at the computer going

341
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,920
well the vpd looks good the ph of the

342
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,399
water looks good this fan is working

343
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:43,519
everything is good in the computer

344
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,958
but the plants are over there telling

345
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:47,039
you something's wrong we forget to look

346
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:48,719
at the plants so learn to look at the

347
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:50,159
plants and read those plants see what

348
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,959
the plants are telling you the plants

349
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:54,958
have all of the answers we rely so much

350
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:57,119
on meters and computers and toys and

351
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:58,399
gadgets i didn't have all that stuff

352
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,320
when we started it sounds like i'm a

353
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,240
dinosaur but i haven't been growing for

354
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,800
that long the evolution of growing

355
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:07,278
technology with legalization has made it

356
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:08,719
super easy all the tools all the toys

357
00:12:07,278 --> 00:12:11,278
all the tips and tricks are already

358
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,480
available when i started i couldn't just

359
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:13,679
get on the internet and i couldn't just

360
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,120
call somebody because it was kind of

361
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:16,879
secretive we would have gone to jail if

362
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,799
i told too many damn people about the

363
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:21,039
grow i had to watch the plants and

364
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:24,078
figure out what they were telling me

365
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:25,759
so learn to watch those plants develop

366
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:27,759
one thing we're forgetting about also is

367
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:29,439
the relationship with the plants the

368
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:31,600
computers the toys the gadgets the

369
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,600
devices they've kind of removed us from

370
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,519
the plant we're looking into the screen

371
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,120
uh but there's a lot of cool [ __ ] there

372
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,039
but everything we need to know is over

373
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,200
there on the plank go sit by the plant

374
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:42,958
go touch the plant go smell it go

375
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,720
observe it you're gonna notice more

376
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:46,399
looking at the plants than you ever will

377
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,240
to screen if you can't figure it out by

378
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,679
looking at the plant look at the screen

379
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,000
then put the math together it'll give

380
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:53,838
you a hint but definitely focus more on

381
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,759
the plants a lot of people say hey my

382
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,440
runoff numbers are looking good or this

383
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:59,759
number doesn't look good on the meter

384
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,680
what can i do and my response is how do

385
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:02,720
the plants look dude are the plants okay

386
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:04,719
and they go yeah the plants look great

387
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,480
but my numbers are bad and i say

388
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,800
i don't care the meters don't matter i

389
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,399
am not growing ph meters and ec meters

390
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:11,679
and that doesn't matter i want to know

391
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,120
what the plants look like i'm growing

392
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:15,120
plants that's what really matters so i

393
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,440
got off on a ramble there but

394
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,919
learn the plants learn to identify

395
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:22,079
deficiencies overfeeding underfeeding

396
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:24,159
over watering underwatering heat stress

397
00:13:22,078 --> 00:13:26,078
cold stress um have you ever thought

398
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:27,679
that you can just reach over and touch a

399
00:13:26,078 --> 00:13:29,039
plant just like mom used to do when

400
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:30,319
you're little or your dad used to do

401
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:31,439
like you need a jacket you're like no

402
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,800
i'm fine and they just reach down and

403
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,720
touch you like no you're cold you need a

404
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:36,719
jacket they'd give you a jacket you can

405
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,959
reach out and touch your plants they are

406
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,480
yours touch them feel them are they cold

407
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:42,719
do they feel slimy because they're so

408
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,159
humid how do they feel touch them learn

409
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,920
them so

410
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:48,078
i would run a full cycle and i would

411
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:50,240
take a lot of notes and pay a lot of

412
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:52,559
attention start from the very beginning

413
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,480
and build a process take notes and

414
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:56,000
observe then here's what i want you to

415
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,000
think about

416
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,480
why are you doing everything you're

417
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,320
doing what is the purpose for everything

418
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,879
you were doing there's got to be a rhyme

419
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:07,278
or a reason for what you were doing to

420
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:10,000
those plants then also think about what

421
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:11,838
are you not doing are you popping and

422
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,159
twisting are you lolly popping are you

423
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:16,720
defoliating are you

424
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:19,120
perfecting the ph are you dialing in the

425
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,959
ec are you making sure that the vpd in

426
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,120
the room is correct what are you not

427
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:25,119
doing that you should be doing so think

428
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,600
about what you are doing and make sure

429
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,360
that every move everything you do has a

430
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,959
purpose why

431
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,199
is it something that

432
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:34,719
you learned from some random dude 20

433
00:14:33,198 --> 00:14:36,319
years ago that is you don't even need to

434
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,920
be doing that anymore stop doing that

435
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,240
that's wasting your time or messing up

436
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:42,078
the crop why are you doing everything

437
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,759
you were doing and then why are you not

438
00:14:42,078 --> 00:14:45,120
doing a lot of the things you know you

439
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:47,838
should be doing there are things you

440
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:50,240
skip and i know that we all do that sort

441
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:52,320
of stuff so winner now while you're

442
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,159
doing all these things notice also when

443
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,720
your plants stop living up to your

444
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:58,480
expectations and take notes

445
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:02,160
it probably happened

446
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:04,320
7 10 maybe 14 days from when you see the

447
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:06,240
turn that's probably where you [ __ ] up

448
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,560
so if you're taking a lot of notes we

449
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,720
can go back in all those notes write

450
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:13,119
down when you go into the grow you

451
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:16,879
should start taking documents from like

452
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:18,959
901 am open to the door 905 fed the

453
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:21,759
plants this and write down exactly what

454
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:24,719
you fed write down the ph and the ec and

455
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:26,159
the ppms of what you fed then

456
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,839
collect some of the runoff and write

457
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:29,360
down what the runoff was and i just said

458
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,600
that those numbers don't matter but they

459
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,759
will help us diagnose a problem because

460
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,600
you're trying to improve so feed the

461
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:38,959
plants write down what time you fed them

462
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:41,600
how much ec ph ppm get all the data you

463
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:43,439
can of the solution going in and coming

464
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,920
out of those plants

465
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:48,560
if you do any defoliation if you do any

466
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:51,198
popping twisting lollipopping write it

467
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:53,599
down if you don't do anything write it

468
00:15:51,198 --> 00:15:55,919
down if you notice some weird [ __ ] write

469
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:58,399
it down if any of your equipment does

470
00:15:55,919 --> 00:16:00,399
anything weird write it down that way

471
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:02,639
we've got a record we've got some sort

472
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:04,320
of a record that was some data that way

473
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,480
we can look back and see what the hell

474
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:09,839
is going on in your grow and we can see

475
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:12,079
where to am prove i said improve kind of

476
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,920
weirdly there but let's make a record

477
00:16:12,078 --> 00:16:16,000
let's make an sop let's make a standard

478
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:17,759
operating procedure let's make a flow

479
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,320
let's use quality products let's lose

480
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:21,600
quality genetics then have a goal when

481
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,079
you start noticing your plants aren't

482
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,680
reaching the expectations then we can

483
00:16:24,078 --> 00:16:27,039
look at the plants how they are and we

484
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:28,239
can look back a couple of weeks ago and

485
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:29,599
say well we should have done this we

486
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,720
didn't do this or we should not have

487
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,879
done this

488
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,480
if you're spraying anything definitely

489
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:36,720
write that down a lot of sprays could

490
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,480
have adverse reactions to your garden

491
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,480
maybe it's a nutrient thing maybe it's

492
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,000
something you're doing but take good

493
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,920
notes when you get to the point when you

494
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,519
notice it's not where you want it to be

495
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:46,799
send me some pictures and we can talk

496
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:48,720
about it together and i'll help you get

497
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:50,958
it dialed in so think about really

498
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,639
intently why are you doing what you're

499
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:55,359
doing in the grow is everything you're

500
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:57,440
doing purpose or is it ritual and if

501
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,879
it's purposeful where did you learn it

502
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,120
is it something that has been tried and

503
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:03,360
true has it been proven or is it just a

504
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,038
move that actually could be diminishing

505
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,798
your results could it be messing up the

506
00:17:05,038 --> 00:17:09,038
outcome could it be a complete waste of

507
00:17:06,798 --> 00:17:11,038
time and money or could it be greatly

508
00:17:09,038 --> 00:17:12,959
improving your product think about that

509
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:15,119
every time you make a move in the grow

510
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,959
if it's just ritual let's get rid of it

511
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:19,359
sometimes people have to do weird ritual

512
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,880
[ __ ] if it's a waste of time stop doing

513
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:22,798
it if it's something that keeps your ocd

514
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,400
under control i get it but let's

515
00:17:22,798 --> 00:17:26,798
minimize the weird [ __ ] we do in the

516
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,240
grow just because our uncle taught us to

517
00:17:26,798 --> 00:17:30,079
do that seven years ago and we've been

518
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,798
doing it ever since you've been doing it

519
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:34,639
wrong maybe for seven years bro

520
00:17:32,798 --> 00:17:36,480
when it comes to growing there are a lot

521
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,720
of things to dial in we've got a lot of

522
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,400
equipment to think about we've got a lot

523
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,079
of feeding to think about there's a lot

524
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,160
of technique to think about of course

525
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:45,918
genetics make a big role i make a big

526
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,400
part in this whole uh the whole chess

527
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:50,400
board here is what i like to call it

528
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:53,120
there are a lot of things to dial in

529
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,120
don't focus on dialing in everything all

530
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:57,439
at one time let's go baby steps let's

531
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:59,199
identify a couple of small problems make

532
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,279
a few small changes because if you make

533
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,200
a bunch of big changes how do you know

534
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:05,519
what worked what didn't work let's make

535
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,880
one or two changes at a time you've been

536
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:08,639
growing for 18 years and you're

537
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,160
frustrated if we get you a little bit

538
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,160
better over the next couple of years we

539
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,080
will see improvement you'll see progress

540
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,440
hopefully you feel encouragement you've

541
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:17,038
already got all the stuff you've been at

542
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,200
it let's get you improved let's get you

543
00:18:17,038 --> 00:18:21,200
going your question was how long do i go

544
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,798
until i throw in the towel

545
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,640
the main thing is that we identify the

546
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:26,400
issue and make some corrections and make

547
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,840
some changes i don't know that you had

548
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,440
the right guidance and the right idea to

549
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:32,000
make those corrections and changes so

550
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,200
hopefully i can help you out um there

551
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,279
are a lot of things to think about and

552
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,600
dial in so make small changes one step

553
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:39,678
at a time don't change too many things

554
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:41,519
and do everything i keep saying this do

555
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:44,240
and this goes to everybody growing out

556
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:46,798
there do everything in your garden with

557
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:49,038
intent and purpose why are you doing

558
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:50,240
that if i go why did you do that you

559
00:18:49,038 --> 00:18:51,839
should have a good reason it shouldn't

560
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,400
just be oh i don't know or just because

561
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:56,720
it should be i did that because of this

562
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,160
and there should be a solid answer and a

563
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,679
reason think about that while you're in

564
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,519
the grow think about that while you're

565
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:04,240
mixing nutrients cutting clones

566
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:06,240
defoliating lollipopping topping popping

567
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,319
twisting putting up the trellis think

568
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,319
about why am i doing this the way that i

569
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:11,839
am doing it what would rasta jeff do in

570
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:13,439
this situation

571
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:15,519
maybe you're doing some silly [ __ ] that

572
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:18,880
is wasting time causing problems and

573
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:20,480
minimizing your potential for success i

574
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,840
don't want anybody to quit growing out

575
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,759
there so if you're planning on quitting

576
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:24,959
if you're getting frustrated please send

577
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:26,480

604
00:20:14,558 --> 00:20:18,240
better grower than me that's that's how

605
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,000
you see true progress when the uh when

606
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,159

limited by genetics i know who you are

619
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:47,839

you send me a lot of emails if you need

624
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,880
a pack of seeds because you don't feel

625
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,480
like your genetics are reaching your

626
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,799
potential let me know i'd be happy to

627
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,240
give you some fresh high quality beans

628
00:21:00,798 --> 00:21:03,759
get you going you can do a pheno hunt

629
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,558
find the phenotype that works best for

630
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:08,240
you then grow that one to perfection

631
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:10,798
build a relationship build a system with

632
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:13,679
that plan maybe possibly the genetics

633
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:15,519
are your limiting factor everybody else

634
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:17,919
