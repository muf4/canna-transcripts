37
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:40,599
may be a quick episode because I am a

38
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:42,280
little focused a little excited about

39
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:43,959
the dude grows cup I've only got a

40
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,359
couple of days here until the cup

41
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:46,438
happens if we're going in real time I'm

42
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:48,000
at the cup right now while you're

43
00:01:46,438 --> 00:01:49,679
listening to this if we don't want to

44
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,759
blur the uh the uh what is it the

45
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,759
Terminator timeline here anyway let's

46
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,959

85
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,519
to Dennis thank you for the great

86
00:03:29,438 --> 00:03:33,598

87
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,319

of seeds from

90
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,400
iirc the question says yo Rasta Jeff can

91
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:45,200
you take clones from your female seeds

92
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:47,400
once they grow and will they still

93
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:48,639
produce good weed all right there's a

94
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,879
lot of things to think about here I'm

95
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:52,798
not sure exactly what you mean but let

96
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:54,280
me uh observe and think about all the

97
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,480
different directions this question could

98
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:59,199
be going uh can you take clones from

99
00:03:56,479 --> 00:04:01,199
female seeds are you asking uh can we

100
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:03,078
clone a feminized a plant that came from

101
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:05,438
a fem seed if it was a female seed is

102
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:08,200
that clonable yes absolutely you can

103
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:10,479
definitely clone that fem seed basically

104
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:12,280
you can clone any cannabis plant other

105
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:14,959
than an autoflow I would not recommend

106
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:16,720
cloning an autoflow but you can clone

107
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,079
almost any cannabis plant out there if

108
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,759
you do it properly uh if you do it with

109
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:23,160
a good standard operating procedure to

110
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:25,319
create or to avoid any problems if the

111
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,639
donor plant is healthy and happy yes you

112
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:29,918
can clone just about anything and the

113
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:31,960
question is uh once they grow so can you

114
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:33,758
clone your female seeds once they grow

115
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:36,120
do you mean like while it's in veg can I

116
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:38,479
clone it yes absolutely uh once you put

117
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:40,120
it into flour can you clone it you can

118
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:41,918
if you do it strategically don't take

119
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:44,478
the tops take stuff from the bottom you

120
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:45,879
can definitely clone that so that's uh a

121
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:47,439
couple angles I'm thinking the question

122
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:49,079
may come from you can clone the fem

123
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:51,439
seeds you can clone them while they're

124
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:54,918
in veg or early flour and then it says

125
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:57,439
will they produce good weed still um if

126
00:04:54,918 --> 00:04:59,240
this is all done properly the donor

127
00:04:57,439 --> 00:05:00,478
plant the mother plant which the Clone

128
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,879
came from

129
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:04,038
um if your timing is right if your

130
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:06,560
Technique is right that plant will still

131
00:05:04,038 --> 00:05:08,240
produce quality product uh the Clone

132
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,280
that you took if you did it properly if

133
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,240
you veg it properly and take care of it

134
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:14,119
it will still produce a quality product

135
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,759
these should be clones um of the

136
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,840
original plant if that original plant

137
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:21,080
was any good that second plant that

138
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:22,239
clone should also be equally as good so

139
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:24,478
there are a lot of different things here

140
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,319
that are open to interpretation in this

141
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:28,599
question in my mind but I think I've

142
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:30,960
covered most Avenues uh can you clone

143
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,840
your female seeds once they grow I

144
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:35,478
assume you mean feminized seeds or just

145
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:38,560
a female plant in general yes absolutely

146
00:05:35,478 --> 00:05:39,959
you can clone that once it grows I'm not

147
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,439
sure if you mean like once it gets big

148
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:44,519
enough to actually take a clone of or if

149
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:47,918
you mean once it's in flour but either

150
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:50,399
way with strategery uh with location and

151
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:51,959
uh timing and being careful and not

152
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:54,239
giving uh any stress to that plant

153
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:56,758
that's undue then yes you can clone that

154
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,840
and will they produce good weed still uh

155
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:00,280
basically that's up to you my dude if

156
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:02,719
you're a quality grower if you've

157
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:04,799
provide all the quality parameters that

158
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,520
plant should be able to give you a

159
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,360
quality product all right my dude Dennis

160
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:10,918
uh thank you for the quick question here

161
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,960

165
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:22,120
weird misconceptions about feminized

166
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:24,319
seeds I hear things like can I breed to

167
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,800
a feminized plant absolutely I've done

168
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,960
that I breed to Lemon Jeffrey lemon

169
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,598
Jeffrey is feminized I've hit lemon

170
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:31,478
Jeffrey with multiple different kinds of

171
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:32,959
of pollen everything that comes out of

172
00:06:31,478 --> 00:06:35,159
that has been [ __ ] Stellar no

173
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:37,120
problems there you can breed to your Fen

174
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:39,319
plants you can clone your Fen plants you

175
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,879
can mother out your F plants they are

176
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:43,280
just like all of the other plants that

177
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:45,279
you work with except they were feminized

178
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:47,399
from the beginning the only difference

179
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:49,679
was the pollen it is my theory it's my

180
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:51,879
opinion is my experience my education my

181
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,720
research leads me to believe that the

182
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:56,800
feminized aspect the sex of your plant

183
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,639
mostly comes from that pollen I want to

184
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,000
say 99% of that comes from the pollen

185
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:03,160
that's where the decision is made before

186
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,120
it even hits the female plant that

187
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:06,479
pollen knows if it's a boy or a girl and

188
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,120
when it hits your female plant the

189
00:07:06,478 --> 00:07:10,598
decision's already made so um yeah

190
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,160
there's no difference play with those

191
00:07:10,598 --> 00:07:14,959
feminized plants just like you do any

192
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,840
other plant we're going to keep moving

193
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:18,279
I've got another great question here

194
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:20,239
this one touches on the topic that I'm

195
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:22,598
rambling about a little bit this one

196
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,079
came from my new friend just Ken what's

197
00:07:22,598 --> 00:07:25,839
up just Ken make sure you check your

198
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:28,839
inbox because you've got a coupon code

199
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:31,000
for a free pack of seeds from idirect

200
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:33,038
decom and yes when those coupon codes

201
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,918
come with an expiration date they really

202
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:37,639
do expire a lot of people say hey does

203
00:07:34,918 --> 00:07:38,959
this expire on this expiration date

204
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:40,519
that's what that means bro it does

205
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:42,758
expire I have to put an expiration date

206
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:44,758
on those coupon codes uh basically for

207
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:45,919
bookkeeping and logistic purposes I

208
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:47,759
don't want to have coupon codes out

209
00:07:45,918 --> 00:07:49,439
there floating forever and then just

210
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,720
somebody decides to redeem them in three

211
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:53,000
years that's not going to work for a

212
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,240
business so I do give them uh an

213
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,519
expiration date also it encourages you

214
00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:00,000
encourages you to shop if it if it's

215
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:01,680
good forever it'll just sit there go buy

216
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,759
some [ __ ] then grow it that's what I

217
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,598
want you to do all right this message

218
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:08,598
once again from just Ken it goes hey

219
00:08:06,598 --> 00:08:11,120
rosta Jeff thank you for everything you

220
00:08:08,598 --> 00:08:13,079
do you are truly an inspiration and a

221
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,800
wealth of knowledge hey thank you for

222
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:16,878
that I do appreciate it I've been doing

223
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,800
this podcast for uh I think I said 10

224
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,400
years recently uh and I love it I love

225
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,720
giving this information to people I love

226
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:24,318
sharing I love spreading the knowledge

227
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,639
um I feel like if I didn't teach if I

228
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,280
didn't share this it would be a

229
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:30,400
disservice to the community and to what

230
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:32,038
I believe in that blessed me with this

231
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:34,679
skills and ability so it's got to come

232
00:08:32,038 --> 00:08:36,598
out of me or I may spontaneously combust

233
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:38,278
but thank you uh thanks for noticing

234
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:39,879
that uh I am an inspiration that's

235
00:08:38,278 --> 00:08:42,158
[ __ ] awesome to hear and a wealth of

236
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:44,559
knowledge now it does go on it says I've

237
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:46,679
got a quick question about pollen you

238
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:49,199
know me I like talking about pollen it

239
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:52,278
says when you reverse a whole or part of

240
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,959
a female plant um I've noticed that

241
00:08:52,278 --> 00:08:55,799
reversing part of a plant sometimes it

242
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:57,079
doesn't work as well some plants are

243
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:58,639
stubborn you gotta you got to spray the

244
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:00,079
whole [ __ ] thing it just works so

245
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:01,759
much better just get in there and

246
00:09:00,078 --> 00:09:03,879
reverse that [ __ ] but we'll stay on

247
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:06,278
track when you reverse a female plant

248
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:08,919
will that pollen always make feminized

249
00:09:06,278 --> 00:09:10,879
seeds um and then it wraps up with I'm

250
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:12,719
finding a lot of uneducated information

251
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:14,958
about this also all right so we're going

252
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:19,240
to we're going to touch on this part um

253
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:21,559
if so is fem pollen always fem poen my

254
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:23,079
answer to that um and shout out to JH

255
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:25,518
we're going to get more feedback from JH

256
00:09:23,078 --> 00:09:28,278
on this one if the female plant that you

257
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,879
are using to make that pollen that

258
00:09:28,278 --> 00:09:32,439
female plant that you were choosing to

259
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:35,799
reverse if that is a solid female that

260
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:39,079
does not have interex traits then yes

261
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:41,199
that pollen will always be female pollen

262
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:43,278
um there is like a one somewhere between

263
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,000
and this is this is a very wide range

264
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:47,159
but somewhere between one and 100 and

265
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
one and a million chance of something

266
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:51,159
going weird with that feminized plant

267
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,519
even if you chose a solid female nature

268
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:55,039
is going to do weird [ __ ] maybe you're

269
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,320
pollen donor maybe you're pollen

270
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:59,399
receiver maybe when two specific plants

271
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:01,959
hit you're going to see some sort of

272
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:04,078
anomalies you may get an interex plant

273
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:06,039
you may find a a pure male come out of

274
00:10:04,078 --> 00:10:07,479
some of those feminized plants but like

275
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:09,439
I said that's one in a million that

276
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:11,200
could be up to one in a million chance

277
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,680
I've seen it what I think two times I've

278
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,360
seen a male come from a femin sea line

279
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:17,639
not my stuff there's another breeder out

280
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:21,120
there a long time ago we talked about uh

281
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:23,720
but it does happen it is possible but uh

282
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,320
99.9% of the time uh if you did it

283
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:27,920
correctly if the selection was done

284
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:30,600
properly then yes that pollen will be

285
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:32,679
feminized pollen for ever um it's not

286
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:35,519
going to be reg pollen because there are

287
00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:36,958
no male chromosomes present in the

288
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,600
female plant that you're working with

289
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:42,239
you're taking all X chromosomes and you

290
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,879
are making pollen from that there's no Y

291
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,839
chromosome we can't there unless it's

292
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:48,240
introduced through that plant it's not

293
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:50,519
there that pollen will all be female I'm

294
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,320
rambling at this point but um if you do

295
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:55,360
reverse a plant that is pure female it

296
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:57,760
will always produce uh female pollen

297
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:01,039
feminized seed pollen there is more to

298
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:02,399
this it says also does r or Auto pollen

299
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:05,120
make a difference no that's the same

300
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:07,879
thing uh R and autoflow the only

301
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,959
difference there is uh reg or uh and you

302
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:12,159
mean photo you don't mean reg I I looked

303
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:15,679
over that word also uh photo period or

304
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:17,639
Auto period pollen make a difference um

305
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:19,039
no if it's uh it'll do what it's going

306
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:21,759
to do though just keep in mind if you

307
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:24,360
use autoflow pollen on your regular

308
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:26,439
Plants some of your progeny will also

309
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:28,839
come out feminized autoflow that's how

310
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:30,399
you start making Autoflower lines but no

311
00:11:28,839 --> 00:11:32,600
that part doesn't make a difference

312
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:35,000
feminizing reversing is the same thing

313
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:37,399
if you're using uh Autos or photo period

314
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,600
plants my notes that I wrote on the page

315
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:42,639
were uh fem pollen is fem pollen if you

316
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:44,879
have reversed a plant made female pollen

317
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:47,320
that is female pollen however like I

318
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:50,000
said if you reversed an interex plant if

319
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:52,760
you reversed a hermaphodite that genes

320
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
or that pollen will have those genes in

321
00:11:52,759 --> 00:11:57,240
there so that plant will produce more

322
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,559
interex plants if you do that that's a

323
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,480
whole another side rant my last note was

324
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:04,958
uh unless one parent is in sex

325
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:07,440
everything will be okay so um the

326
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:09,958
question is will pollen will fem pollen

327
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,360
stay Fen pollen yes it will there's no

00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:18,120
happen with your pollen if if disclaimer

331
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:22,440

here in front of me this one also came

339
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:37,879
from that growel tab this came from my

340
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,120
new friend who wants to be called Black

341
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:43,159
Forest Gardens shout out to Black Forest

342
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:45,159
Gardens the question says Hey Rasta Jeff

343
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:47,679
I've got a question possibly a

344
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:49,958
multi-part question about changing the

345
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:52,120
timing of my light cycle this is a very

346
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:53,759
common question uh being somebody who's

347
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:56,519
grown for so many years and had to make

348
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:58,519
so many changes I understand this exact

349
00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:00,600
situation and I've got some good solid

350
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:02,839
advice for you my dude before I get that

351
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,800
far let me remind you to check your

352
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:07,959
inbox cuz you've got a coupon code for a

353
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:09,319
free pack of seeds from I direct.com you

354
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:12,119
guys make sure you check your spam

355
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:15,000
because a lot of times those do go to

356
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:16,759
the spam box all right the question is

357
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
so instead of the lights being on during

358
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:20,838
the day uh they will be on at night to

359
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,720
help me get around heat issues yes

360
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:25,320
that's a very smart idea um So currently

361
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,000
this listener has their grow lights on

362
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:29,199
during the day they want to flip that

363
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,639
and run the lights at night because you

364
00:13:29,198 --> 00:13:33,039
don't have to compete with the sun it's

365
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,680
not as uh hot at night it gets naturally

366
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:37,719
cooler so it's easier to cool the grow

367
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:39,638
spaces also electricity is cheaper at

368
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:41,199
off peak hour so you may be saving a few

369
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:44,000
bucks there as well you don't have to

370
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:45,879
run as much AC and the AC that you do

371
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,639
need to run doesn't cost as much so

372
00:13:45,879 --> 00:13:50,078
let's stay focused which is hard for me

373
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:52,440
today it says now uh now that it's

374
00:13:50,078 --> 00:13:54,359
getting warmer here I could skip that

375
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:56,240
part I want to lower my power bill would

376
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:59,360
it be more beneficial to let the ladies

377
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:01,919
have a oneoff 24-hour Darkness period

378
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,839
before their scheduled change or uh

379
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:06,000
change the night shift would that quick

380
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,519
change to night shift throw them way off

381
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
of their natural cycles that I've

382
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:13,039
developed while flowering and stress

383
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,360
them out and could the amount of time um

384
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:16,759
okay so there's a couple of questions

385
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:18,039
here I'm going to skip this uh second

386
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:19,639
part and just get right to the point

387
00:14:18,039 --> 00:14:21,278
here all right my buddy Black Forest

388
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:23,079
Gardener it does sound like you've got

389
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:25,838
the right idea here by trying to give

390
00:14:23,078 --> 00:14:28,039
these plants an extended dark period

391
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:30,079
before flipping that timer because if

392
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:32,198
you wanted to go so let's just say that

393
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:33,838
the lights come on at 9:00 a.m. now they

394
00:14:32,198 --> 00:14:35,799
go off at 9:00 p.m. if you were to just

395
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:38,320
flip them back on that would give them

396
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:40,278
24 hours of light and uh the second part

397
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,040
of the question is does the uh age of

398
00:14:40,278 --> 00:14:44,399
the flowering plants really have a lot

399
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:46,719
to do with this yes it does but also I

400
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,519
would not do that to my flowering plants

401
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,839
that will give you the opportunity for

402
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:52,480
problems uh that gives them a full day

403
00:14:50,839 --> 00:14:54,079
of lights on with no rest and then

404
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,039
you're going to give them sleep that

405
00:14:54,078 --> 00:14:58,679
will confuse them I think you've got the

406
00:14:56,039 --> 00:15:01,000
right idea by doing the extended dark

407
00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:03,239
period now let's touch on one detail you

408
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,919
do have the right idea if you time this

409
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:08,159
properly you said 24 hours of Darkness

410
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:10,360
so if those lights come on at 9:00 a.m.

411
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:12,879
and then they go off at 900 p.m. if you

412
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:15,600
give it 24 hours from there and turn it

413
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:17,958
back on at the next 900 p.m. that will

414
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,199
be perfect yes then you'll be back on uh

415
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,958
when the lights are off this could be

416
00:15:19,198 --> 00:15:23,000
700 p.m. 8:00 p.m. whatever I'm just

417
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:24,679
using N9 as my number uh that's when

418
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,120
mine happen is 9:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m.

419
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:29,159
is what I like uh works good for my life

420
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:32,600
but so if they come on at 9:00 and go

421
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:34,919
off at 9:00 um pull pull that plug when

422
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:37,120
they go off and then let 900 p.m. come

423
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:39,360
back around and then turn them back on

424
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,000
yes you do have the exact correct idea I

425
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,800
really do think that that short break of

426
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,759
light will be much more beneficial than

427
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:47,439
extended light uh the plants really

428
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:48,959
prefer extra dark over extra day just

429
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,240
imagine and this is something that I

430
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:52,318
talk about every time I talk about

431
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,720
interrupting light cycles imagine if

432
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:57,679
this were you uh imagine if you woke up

433
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:59,680
one day at 900 p.m. and the sun was up

434
00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:01,278
you would freak the [ __ ] out what the

435
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:02,799
it's 9:00 p.m. and the Sun is up what

436
00:16:01,278 --> 00:16:05,439
are we going to do everything is going

437
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:06,639
to freak out but if 9:00 a.m. came and

438
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,399
it was still a little cloudy and a

439
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,680
little dark outside and I said hey bro

440
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,399
you don't have to get up you could sleep

441
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:12,879
a little bit extra today you'd be just

442
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:14,198
fine you'd curl up you'd snuggle in

443
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:16,198
you'd get a few more hours of sleep and

444
00:16:14,198 --> 00:16:18,318
you would enjoy it but if I put that sun

445
00:16:16,198 --> 00:16:20,479
up at 9:00 p.m. and woke up your sleep

446
00:16:18,318 --> 00:16:22,078
you'd probably freak out the plants feel

447
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,120
the exact same way about it if you give

448
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:25,239
them extra sleeping time they're okay

449
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:27,000
but if you turn off the lights when

450
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:28,720
they're sleeping just like you they're

451
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,078
going to get a little bit pissy about it

452
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,920
let let me make sure I'm not skipping

453
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:34,958
anything with the second half of the

454
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:36,000
question um let's see would it change uh

455
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:38,000
and could the amount of time they've

456
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,440
been in flower affect them it may make a

457
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,879
small difference but I still wouldn't

458
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,560
mess with them that way I would still be

459
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:45,600
as gentle gentle gentle as possible it

460
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:47,518
says I grow perpetually so shutting down

461
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,920
isn't an option and I have plants in

462
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:52,959
various stages uh yes this all makes

463
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:55,559
sense uh do that 24 24 hours from when

464
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:57,000
they turn off uh just let them skip that

465
00:16:55,559 --> 00:16:58,439
uh they'll go off let them have their

466
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,839
off let them have their daytime that

467
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:02,560
they would nor nor Al get but don't turn

468
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:04,838
it on then 900 p.m. kick them right back

469
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:07,240
on you should be right back in Action

470
00:17:04,838 --> 00:17:08,798
