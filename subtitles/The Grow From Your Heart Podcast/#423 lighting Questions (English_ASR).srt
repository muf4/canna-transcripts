1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,410

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:06,660
time for episode 423 of The Grove from

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:07,950
your heart podcast this episode of the

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,169
show is brought to you by our friends at

5
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:12,030
Oregon elite seeds it is time to add

6
00:00:10,169 --> 00:00:14,160
fresh new genetics to your garden and I

7
00:00:12,029 --> 00:00:19,278
highly recommend Oregon elite seeds and

8
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,278
you can find them at www.imtcva.org

9
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:33,689
sunset herb and purple punch the flavor

10
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:35,009
description on the container says it

11
00:00:33,689 --> 00:00:36,960
should taste like tropical fruit

12
00:00:35,009 --> 00:00:40,199
cocktail I would say that is accurate

13
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:43,160
the potency label says 69 point two

14
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:46,260
seven percent total THC and zero percent

15
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:47,849
CBD when I crack this open I start

16
00:00:46,259 --> 00:00:50,820
thinking that I don't know if I know

17
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:53,129
what a Maitai really smells like that is

18
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:55,500
not a familiar aroma for me but as I

19
00:00:53,128 --> 00:00:58,049
give this a sniff it smells like a Long

20
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,909
Island iced tea it's got a tropical

21
00:00:58,049 --> 00:01:02,369
aroma it has got a very pungent aroma

22
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:04,408
but that may be a triple sec sort of a

23
00:01:02,369 --> 00:01:06,420
thing definitely dominates the smell of

24
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:08,100
the mai tai it is delicious it is

25
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,379
obviously quite potent because it has

26
00:01:08,099 --> 00:01:12,449
got me talking my face off this is great

27
00:01:10,379 --> 00:01:14,250

67
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:35,969
would like to cover several episodes

68
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:37,740
back before 4/20 I started asking people

69
00:02:35,969 --> 00:02:40,500
to send in submissions and let me know

70
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:42,870
what 4/20 means to you I got a lot of

71
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,759
great submissions of course many of you

72
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:47,370
are cannabis consumers which means that

73
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:49,319
4/20 came and passed you up you didn't

74
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:52,110
even realize it was 4/20 a lot of you

75
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:53,849
messaged me on 4/20 or right after here

76
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:57,180
is a submission I received on the

77
00:02:53,849 --> 00:02:59,159
afternoon of 4/20 so this is what 4/20

78
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00,480
means to a friend of the podcast this

79
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:03,840
one goes like this

80
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:06,269
when I see or hear 420 I smile and I say

81
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,099
thank you for saving my life I am in

82
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:10,890
constant pain from a pinched nerve in my

83
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:14,400
neck and three screwed-up lower back

84
00:03:10,889 --> 00:03:15,029
discs plus a 15 millimeter by 22

85
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,909
millimeter

86
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:20,969
crack in my left knee socket I had

87
00:03:17,909 --> 00:03:22,560
enough and wanted to get just high for

88
00:03:20,969 --> 00:03:25,620
the fun of it and hoped it would get me

89
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,569
numb I was getting ready to leave and

90
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:29,459
I'd started giving my [ __ ] away to all

91
00:03:27,569 --> 00:03:31,530
my peoples I was done with all of my

92
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:33,840
pains and being angry all the time and I

93
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:37,110
was stressed out I was overweight I was

94
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:40,110
at 365 pounds you know I was mentally

95
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:41,880
and emotionally checking out then I

96
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:44,310
asked my buddy ender what was good for

97
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:46,289
pain sleep or just help with stress I

98
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:47,939
thought the 18 year old kid would

99
00:03:46,289 --> 00:03:50,219
recommend something that was just strong

100
00:03:47,939 --> 00:03:52,050
as hell lots of THC and that would get

101
00:03:50,219 --> 00:03:54,359
me high as hell I thought that's

102
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:55,500
everyone I thought that's what everyone

103
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,630
was talking about when they said

104
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:00,030
cannabis helped them that they were just

105
00:03:57,629 --> 00:04:03,329
getting high as a kite so the kid says

106
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:05,580
something like try Romulan or sleep pain

107
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:08,400
for sleep or pain or Jack the Ripper for

108
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:10,140
daytime pain or OG Kush and so on so I

109
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,319
get home it's close to bedtime so

110
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:14,909
Romulan slept great first time since

111
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:16,980
1997 so cannabis helped this guy sleep

112
00:04:14,909 --> 00:04:19,048
for the first time since 97 he is it

113
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:21,870
it's 2019 how would you feel if you

114
00:04:19,048 --> 00:04:23,579
hadn't had a nap since [ __ ] 1997 some

115
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:25,379
of you say I've been up for two days or

116
00:04:23,579 --> 00:04:27,479
I didn't get any sleep last night this

117
00:04:25,379 --> 00:04:29,310
dude said he's been up since 97

118
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:31,020
so our friend smoked a little bit of

119
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:32,879
Romulan on the recommendation of a

120
00:04:31,019 --> 00:04:36,810
budtender and he got his first good

121
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:38,879
night's sleep since 1997 he goes on to

122
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:40,980
say then I tried Oh G cush that's when I

123
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:42,719
got this stuff that really works so I

124
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:45,390
put the brakes on all that checking out

125
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,400
[ __ ] and started growing and I

126
00:04:45,389 --> 00:04:50,129
haven't looked back at those dark days

127
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:54,149
until you asked me what does 4/20 mean

128
00:04:50,129 --> 00:04:56,240
to me so in short it sounds like this

129
00:04:54,149 --> 00:04:58,799
guy was done with life he was looking to

130
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,960
possibly take his own life in the very

131
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,660
near future if he hadn't discovered the

132
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:06,479
proper strains of cannabis his pain his

133
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:08,280
discomfort his attitude his health his

134
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:10,259
weight everything was stacking up to

135
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:11,849
where he was done he had emotionally

136
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:13,259
checked out he had checked out of his

137
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:14,610
friends and family it sounds like he was

138
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:16,319
giving a [ __ ] away when you get to that

139
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:18,420
point you were close to doing something

140
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:21,629
ridiculous that you can't stop you can't

141
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:23,640
undo he was about to get there he smoked

142
00:05:21,629 --> 00:05:25,829
the appropriate strain of cannabis based

143
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:27,509
on a bud tenders recommendation and he

144
00:05:25,829 --> 00:05:30,180
finally got some sleep imagine getting

145
00:05:27,509 --> 00:05:31,709
some sleep since 1997 you're gonna be

146
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,459
tired you finally get some rest it's

147
00:05:31,709 --> 00:05:33,930
gonna change your life

148
00:05:32,459 --> 00:05:35,489
you're gonna start being nicer to people

149
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:37,530
your attitudes gonna change when you're

150
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:39,000
nicer to people they're nicer back that

151
00:05:37,529 --> 00:05:40,589
has a lot to do with your health your

152
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,720
mental health and my opinion will play a

153
00:05:40,589 --> 00:05:44,250
lot with how your body feels so our

154
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,100
friend consumed some cannabis and

155
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:48,930
basically it saved his life now he is

156
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:51,030
one of us now he is a grower he's a

157
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:52,829
smoker and he is an advocate I know this

158
00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:54,599
who this person is he does contribute to

159
00:05:52,829 --> 00:05:56,759
the podcast heavily he gets a shout out

160
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,140
on a lot of episodes he actually says

161
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:59,519
his name here in the future in the

162
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:01,439
message so we are going to give him a

163
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:03,449
shout-out here on this so cannabis has

wit sin and cannabis kind of turned him

190
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:54,689
around maybe that story alone will

191
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:57,270

204
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:22,379
social media handles he also talks about

205
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:24,330
some other things here that we don't

206
00:07:22,379 --> 00:07:26,100
need to share on the show he says thanks

207

208

so damn good and then he said sorry for

209
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:32,730
this long-ass email I'm an old fart

210
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,650
grower and all of this is new to me and

211
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:36,569
then he gives me it looks like a cloud

212
00:07:34,649 --> 00:07:37,889
emoji I can't read what that emoji as my

213
00:07:36,569 --> 00:07:39,509
computer printed it out kind of oddly

214
00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:41,789
and then a fist bump so big shout out

215
00:07:39,509 --> 00:07:43,889
for the fist bump right there and that

216
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:46,680

221
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:56,550
moving story I hope that changes

222
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,840
somebody's outlook on cannabis and dude

223
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:59,550
that was kind of brave for you to go out

224
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:00,839

225
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:02,129
kind of opening up to the whole world

226
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:04,409

233
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:18,089
to you it is not too late send me your

234
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:20,370

00:08:24,899 --> 00:08:28,978
best to find them all and I will read

239
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:31,110
your submission on the show what does

240
00:08:28,978 --> 00:08:32,399
4/20 mean to you and somebody said do

241
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:35,009
you mean the number do you mean the time

242
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:37,529
do you mean the date I don't know what

243
00:08:35,009 --> 00:08:40,139
do you mean when I say 4/20 what does it

244
00:08:37,529 --> 00:08:41,968
mean to you alright now let's get into

245
00:08:40,139 --> 00:08:43,799
those emails that I keep talking about

246
00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:45,960
I've got one right here at the top of

247
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:47,849
the pile this one let's see it says no

248
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:49,830
names I am in prohibition land that

249
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:51,450
makes it easy so let's get right into it

250
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:53,550
it says Russ - Jeff please don't say my

251
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:53,920
name because I am in prohibition land I

252
00:08:53,549 --> 00:08:56,379
do

253
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:59,049
have an indoor garden going first grow

254
00:08:56,379 --> 00:09:01,539
all oto flowers I'm doing a 20 on and 4

255
00:08:59,049 --> 00:09:03,129
hour off flight schedule some of my

256
00:09:01,539 --> 00:09:04,990
plants are already a couple of weeks

257
00:09:03,129 --> 00:09:07,269
into flower and some have just started

258
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:08,860
they were all seed in the same week but

259
00:09:07,269 --> 00:09:10,659
there are three different strains so

260
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:12,759
they are going at different rates yes

261
00:09:10,659 --> 00:09:14,230
that makes sense so far they're from

262
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:15,909
seed they're from auto flowers they're

263
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:17,350
different strains they were bred from

264
00:09:15,909 --> 00:09:19,120
different genetics so they were gonna

265
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:20,649
have different traits they will have

266
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,879
different flowering times they'll start

267
00:09:20,649 --> 00:09:23,679
at different times they'll finish at

268
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:25,389
different times but variety is the spice

269
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:27,278
of life we talked about why in a

270
00:09:25,389 --> 00:09:29,620
previous episode let's keep moving

271
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:31,419
forward he says the weather where I live

272
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:33,578
has gotten really nice and I want to

273
00:09:31,419 --> 00:09:35,588
move my plants to my back deck for a few

274
00:09:33,578 --> 00:09:37,689
hours each day for their light cycle

275
00:09:35,589 --> 00:09:39,370
when it's nice is there anything I

276
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:41,949
should know about moving them in and out

277
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:43,659
as far as temps in humidity also should

278
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:45,669
I gradually let them adjust to the

279
00:09:43,659 --> 00:09:48,189
sunlight or is it okay to stick them out

280
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:50,409
there for 12 to 13 hours of daylight in

281
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:52,089
a row he wraps up and he says I'm a

282
00:09:50,409 --> 00:09:53,860
disabled veteran and I'm growing my own

283
00:09:52,089 --> 00:09:57,370
medicine it really helps with my anxiety

284
00:09:53,860 --> 00:10:00,970
and PTSD hey thank you for your service

285
00:09:57,370 --> 00:10:03,159
and I am saddened that you have got PTSD

286
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:04,720
but I am happy to hear that you have

287
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:06,879
found medicine that works for you

288
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,290
because I know that PTSD can be really

289
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:10,179
torturous so I'm glad you've got

290
00:10:08,289 --> 00:10:11,740
something helping you with that now

291
00:10:10,179 --> 00:10:13,750
let's get into this question he said the

292
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:15,430
weather has gotten really nice and I

293
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:18,250
want to move my plants to my back deck

294
00:10:15,429 --> 00:10:19,870
for a few hours in theory that sounds

295
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:21,458
like a really great option those plants

296
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:23,019
would love some sunlight that sunlight

297
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:25,059
would be really good for them it is also

298
00:10:23,019 --> 00:10:27,009
free they're probably also going to love

299
00:10:25,059 --> 00:10:29,409
that outdoor air it is going to be

300
00:10:27,009 --> 00:10:31,088
beautiful for them however my biggest

301
00:10:29,409 --> 00:10:33,309
fear is that you were going to bring

302
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:35,589
bugs into the grow room when you bring

303
00:10:33,309 --> 00:10:38,528
the plants back in no matter how careful

304
00:10:35,589 --> 00:10:41,050
you are no matter what you do I would be

305
00:10:38,528 --> 00:10:43,088
very afraid that I would bring bugs from

306
00:10:41,049 --> 00:10:45,009
that outside environment into my grow

307
00:10:43,089 --> 00:10:46,750
room we spend a lot of time building a

308
00:10:45,009 --> 00:10:48,370
grow room we put a lot of effort into

309
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:50,440
there into kind of keeping it isolated

310
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:52,629
to take those plants right outside that

311
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:55,240
is kind of against everything that I

312
00:10:52,629 --> 00:10:57,370
would do in my grow environment you

313
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:58,720
probably play by your own rules that's

314
00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:01,269
why you're a cannabis grower and a

315
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,278
cannabis consumer I would not take these

316
00:11:01,269 --> 00:11:05,230
plants outside because you may likely

317
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:07,929
bring bugs and when you bring them back

318
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:09,759
in bugs can fly and land on them

319
00:11:07,929 --> 00:11:11,379
bugs can climb up the pot and get right

320
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:12,850
into the dirt bugs will climb up into

321
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:15,100
the dirt then climb up the snake and

322
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:16,870
hide under the leaves also I had another

323
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:19,000
friend who listens to this podcast he

324
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:20,620
was having an issue with his plants we

325
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,879
couldn't figure out what it was one day

326
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:23,679
he told me what when I took them outside

327
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:25,809
they looked fine I've been bringing them

328
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:28,359
back in I realized he had some sort of

329
00:11:25,809 --> 00:11:30,729
soil-borne pests something burrowed from

330
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:33,009
the bottom of his pot up into the root

331
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:35,019
zone up into the soil it infested the

332
00:11:33,009 --> 00:11:36,730
entire root zone of his plants it took

333
00:11:35,019 --> 00:11:38,500
him a long time to recover from that one

334
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:41,080
so I would not suggest taking them

335
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:43,240
outside you've got bugs out there also

336
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:44,590
maybe possibly you've got neighbors out

337
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,120
there I don't know your living situation

338
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:47,139
I don't know your neighborhood maybe

339
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:49,179
you're out in the middle of nowhere

340
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:51,399
however I don't want anybody to see

341
00:11:49,179 --> 00:11:54,129
those plants you said you're a disabled

342
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:56,110
veteran if somebody sees them people are

343
00:11:54,129 --> 00:11:56,799
thieves people are shitty somebody might

344
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:58,509
call the cops

345
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:00,279
be very careful I wouldn't put them out

346
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:02,470
there you say Prohibition land and

347
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:04,629
plants outside that is another big red

348
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:05,740
flag for me I would not do that don't

349
00:12:04,629 --> 00:12:08,620
snitch on yourself there could be a

350
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:10,120
helicopter there could be a [ __ ] Girl

351
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:11,590
Scout cookie sales girl coming by to

352
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,909
sell you some Girl Scout cookies and see

353
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:14,860
your weed plan out on the back deck

354
00:12:12,909 --> 00:12:15,939
again I don't know your situation you

355
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,980
may be out in the middle of the woods

356
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:19,930
where nobody's coming for 20 miles still

357
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:22,480
I would be very careful just because

358
00:12:19,929 --> 00:12:24,099
you're in prohibition land so I wouldn't

359
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,240
take those plants outside you may want

360
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:26,889
to do that because you're a grown-ass

361
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:28,960
man and you can do whatever you want and

362
00:12:26,889 --> 00:12:30,819
I respect that so if you do choose to

363
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:32,470
take these plants outside let me give

364
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:34,570
you some advice that can help you out I

365
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:35,950
would not take them out there and leave

366
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:38,110
them in the Sun for 12 hours

367
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:40,180
I would absolutely introduce them slowly

368
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:41,830
I would take them out when the Sun comes

369
00:12:40,179 --> 00:12:44,439
up for a couple hours maybe an hour or

370
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:45,940
two and watch them see how they react if

371
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,350
they start getting weird take them back

372
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:49,540
in put them back under they're normal

373
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:50,800
grow lights then maybe the next day put

374
00:12:49,539 --> 00:12:52,269
them out there if you went an hour the

375
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:53,829
first day maybe go two hours the next

376
00:12:52,269 --> 00:12:56,259
day maybe go three hours the next day

377
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:58,300
slowly increase the outdoor interval and

378
00:12:56,259 --> 00:12:59,860
see how they react you have to pay very

379
00:12:58,299 --> 00:13:01,479
close attention because if they start

380
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:03,879
acting weird you need to get them back

381
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:05,050
indoors I think if you put them out

382
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:06,759
there for 12 hours

383
00:13:05,049 --> 00:13:08,169
underneath that natural light I think

384
00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:10,269
that maybe a little more than what they

385
00:13:08,169 --> 00:13:12,219
were ever used to I would be like if I

386
00:13:10,269 --> 00:13:13,509
just kept you in a dark basement for a

387
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:14,769
couple of years and then one Friday

388
00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:16,539
night I picked you up and took you to

389
00:13:14,769 --> 00:13:17,769
see the Pink Floyd light show your eyes

390
00:13:16,539 --> 00:13:19,120
would blow out you wouldn't be able to

391
00:13:17,769 --> 00:13:20,860
handle it I think the plants will kind

392
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,310
of feel the same way if we go put them

393
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:23,560
under the

394
00:13:21,309 --> 00:13:24,789
or too long right away without any

395
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:27,188
protection if you've got kind of a

396
00:13:24,789 --> 00:13:28,929
shadier spot to put them in at first and

397
00:13:27,188 --> 00:13:31,328
then move them into the Sun that also

398
00:13:28,929 --> 00:13:32,919
may be a good idea it may not look like

399
00:13:31,328 --> 00:13:35,109
you're getting a light a lot of light

400
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:37,539
out there in a shadier spot but you are

401
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:39,730
absolutely getting enough rays from the

402
00:13:37,539 --> 00:13:41,110
Sun for it to affect that plant in

403
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:44,019
comparison to what you were getting

404
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:46,300
indoor under a grow light that shadier

405
00:13:44,019 --> 00:13:47,889
spot outside is probably more efficient

406
00:13:46,299 --> 00:13:49,958
light than the grow light indoors even

407
00:13:47,889 --> 00:13:51,879
if it's shady because it is the exact

408
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:54,369
spectrum of light that your plants need

409
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:56,350
and it's the Sun you're not gonna dim

410
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:58,688
the Sun too much even with a whole bunch

411
00:13:56,350 --> 00:14:00,550
of clouds even in a shady spot so maybe

412
00:13:58,688 --> 00:14:02,169
start that plant in a shady or area on

413
00:14:00,549 --> 00:14:04,568
your deck and then move it into the

414
00:14:02,169 --> 00:14:06,068
sunlight as the day goes on but pay very

415
00:14:04,568 --> 00:14:08,679
close attention to your plants that

416
00:14:06,068 --> 00:14:10,509
those plants are the boss I can't say

417
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:11,859
that all three are going to enjoy the

418
00:14:10,509 --> 00:14:13,509
same thing you said you've got three

419
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:15,308
different strains you may get different

420
00:14:13,509 --> 00:14:17,199
responses from these plants I don't know

421
00:14:15,308 --> 00:14:19,328
what they're gonna do outside so

422
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:21,458
introduce them to the sunlight slowly

423
00:14:19,328 --> 00:14:23,799
pay close attention to them if you're

424
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:25,599
going to do this another thing I'm

425
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:27,969
thinking about and I'm not sure how much

426
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,920
this will apply to your plants but those

427
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:31,750
plants have never seen the sunlight they

428
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:33,969
don't know that there is sunlight you

429
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:35,919
may introduce them to the idea that

430
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:37,870
there is a light outside much greater

431
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:40,088
than they have ever experienced inside

432
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:42,490
that grow room right now they are

433
00:14:40,089 --> 00:14:43,839
growing because they're adjusted to the

434
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:45,909
amount of light that they are getting

435
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:48,370
they're meeting their dle because of

436
00:14:45,909 --> 00:14:51,698
that grow light if you take them outside

437
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:53,948
they may get used to having more intense

438
00:14:51,698 --> 00:14:55,659
light they may get spoiled when you

439
00:14:53,948 --> 00:14:58,028
bring them back indoors and put them

440
00:14:55,659 --> 00:14:59,558
under your grow light that's not gonna

441
00:14:58,028 --> 00:15:01,240
be enough light to stimulate the

442
00:14:59,558 --> 00:15:02,980
photosynthesis that they were receiving

443
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:05,799
and they may begin to stretch

444
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:07,778
ridiculously fast that will be strain

445
00:15:05,799 --> 00:15:10,240
dependent that will be genetic dependent

446
00:15:07,778 --> 00:15:12,549
but that could be a thing that happens

447
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,709
that's like introducing somebody to ice

448
00:15:12,549 --> 00:15:16,389
cream somebody who is only eaten just a

449
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:18,188
plain diet they just have breakfast

450
00:15:16,389 --> 00:15:20,259
lunch and dinner and no snacks nothing

451
00:15:18,188 --> 00:15:22,178
sweet nothing tasty nothing no kind of

452
00:15:20,259 --> 00:15:24,519
personal treats for their mouth ever and

453
00:15:22,178 --> 00:15:25,688
then one day you take them out to some

454
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:27,698
fancy place and you give them just

455
00:15:25,688 --> 00:15:29,678
pretty good ice cream and now they're

456
00:15:27,698 --> 00:15:31,240
like holy [ __ ] ice cream they're never

457
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:32,409
going to be satisfied with basic

458
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,350
breakfast lunch and dinner anymore

459
00:15:32,409 --> 00:15:36,269
because you introduced them to ice cream

460
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:37,920
cool before they did no ice cream was a

461
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:39,509
thing but now they're like bro ice cream

462
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:41,099
I need some of that [ __ ] because you

463
00:15:39,509 --> 00:15:43,049
introduced it to their lives I feel like

464
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:44,700
maybe the plants will react the same way

465
00:15:43,049 --> 00:15:46,769
they'll say hey I was used to getting

466
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:48,090
sunshine like that's a lot of light

467
00:15:46,769 --> 00:15:49,409
you're not gonna give me that I'm gonna

468
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:51,090
keep stretching for it because I know

469
00:15:49,409 --> 00:15:53,789
that it is an option so when you take

470
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:56,460
them indoors that may backfire on you so

471
00:15:53,789 --> 00:15:58,769
I would completely not take these plants

472
00:15:56,460 --> 00:16:00,870
outside you're risking bug problems then

473
00:15:58,769 --> 00:16:02,819
you're also risking snitches and thieves

474
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:05,730
that is terrible I don't want you to go

475
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:07,890
to jail then my next suggestion is if

476
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:09,779
you're going to take them out there if

477
00:16:07,889 --> 00:16:11,519
you insist on doing it I would leave

478
00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:12,839
them out there don't take them out and

479
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,090
bring them back in because then you're

480
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:16,740
going to contaminate your grow room now

481
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:18,360
I know that the light cycle is probably

482
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:19,889
not appropriate at this time for your

483
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:22,110
auto flower plants to go outside to

484
00:16:19,889 --> 00:16:23,939
continue their flowering cycle but that

485
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:25,440
would be the best-case scenario would

486
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:27,120
just be take them outside and leave them

487
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,530
to finish I understand that it's

488
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,850
probably not an option that's why you

489
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:32,339
want to bring them back in and put them

490
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:34,170
in your room that scares me honestly we

491
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:36,149
put a lot of time and effort into these

492
00:16:34,169 --> 00:16:37,469
grow rooms and to take plants outside

493
00:16:36,149 --> 00:16:39,090
just to get them a little bit of

494
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:40,860
sunlight and bring them back in and then

495
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:42,930
bring the bugs into the grow room that

496
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:45,149
really makes me paranoid as a commercial

497
00:16:42,929 --> 00:16:47,849
cultivator I've got a lot at stake so

498
00:16:45,149 --> 00:16:50,189
one bug can become a problem very

499
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:51,779
quickly it can cost a lot of money this

500
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:54,120
is your medicine that you're relying on

501
00:16:51,779 --> 00:16:55,949
this is what's helping with your PTSD I

502
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,389
wouldn't risk it my friend I would just

503
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:59,730
keep those plants in the grow room and

504
00:16:57,389 --> 00:17:01,500
keep them happy now like I said before

505
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:03,330
you're an adult and you can do whatever

506
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,890
you want so feel free to do what makes

507
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:06,360
you happy because I know there's nothing

508
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:09,030
like taking that plant out on the back

509
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:10,500
deck watching the birds fly around and

510
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:11,970
the squirrels run around and smoking a

511
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,559
fat joint maybe taking a couple of

512
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:15,720
pictures of those plants in the sunshine

513
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:16,740
I understand how good that's gonna feel

514
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:19,350
so if you want to do that

515
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:21,390
feel free have fun grow from your heart

516
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:23,459
make yourself happy just understand the

517
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:24,960
risks while you were doing so hey I want

534
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,960

535
00:17:58,289 --> 00:18:02,909

536
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,740
everything goes according to plan

537
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:07,380

00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:10,349
seeds available at Oregon elite seeds

539

540
00:18:10,349 --> 00:18:15,298
that is the earliest I can promise those

541
00:18:12,779 --> 00:18:17,399
they will be very limited this breeding

542
00:18:15,298 --> 00:18:19,650
batch was very small we are very limited

543
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:22,410
on our numbers here so this batch was a

544
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:25,259
very small batch but around the middle

545
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:27,540
or beginning of July there will be very

546
00:18:25,259 --> 00:18:29,730
few packs of lemon Jeffrey feminized

547
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:31,109

got your back it goes on to say I just

563
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:03,569
wanted to say that I really enjoy your

564
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:05,940
podcast I have listened to all of the

565
00:19:03,569 --> 00:19:07,798
grow shows and I am very appreciative of

566
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:09,600
the information and the help hey thank

567
00:19:07,798 --> 00:19:10,918
you man that means a lot to me just to

568
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:13,199
know that I'm helping somebody makes it

569
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:15,660
worth all of the effort the message goes

570
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:18,029
on it says this is my first grow and I

571
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:20,308
am doing OTO flowers under LED lighting

572
00:19:18,029 --> 00:19:21,808
that I got from Amazon I think the

573
00:19:20,308 --> 00:19:23,759
plants are about two weeks into flower

574
00:19:21,808 --> 00:19:26,369
but I'm not positive because they are

575
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:29,640
autos the plants are doing okay they are

576
00:19:26,369 --> 00:19:31,558
just not really big most are about a

577
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:34,110
foot tall and they have really exploded

578
00:19:31,558 --> 00:19:36,990
in the last couple of weeks I did use

579
00:19:34,109 --> 00:19:39,119
some LST and I have lots of exposed bud

580
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:40,650
sites so he said he's done some low

581
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:42,239
stress training I'm not sure exactly

582
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:43,620
what he's done but he's done a little

583
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,660
bit of training the plants aren't very

584
00:19:43,619 --> 00:19:47,489
big but they're taking off now that they

585
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:49,259
are in flower that is very common so

586
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:50,579
you've probably had them long enough

587
00:19:49,259 --> 00:19:51,839
they've reached their age where the

588
00:19:50,579 --> 00:19:53,099
hormones have developed and they have

589
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:55,859
triggered themselves into flower

590
00:19:53,099 --> 00:19:57,808
they are flowering so far in this email

591
00:19:55,859 --> 00:20:00,990
everything seems okay but there is more

592
00:19:57,808 --> 00:20:02,190
it says anyway my question is this I

593
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:04,788
have been using too

594
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:07,440
of Cheaper LEDs which I got from Amazon

595
00:20:04,788 --> 00:20:09,720
after listening to your podcast I have

596
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,669
decided to do a veg and flower room and

597
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:15,389
the cheaper LEDs are going to veg room

598
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:18,210
and my new hlg 600 h LED should be here

599
00:20:15,388 --> 00:20:21,089
tomorrow so he's ordered a horticultural

600
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:22,950
lighting group 600 H LED and by the time

601
00:20:21,089 --> 00:20:24,839
we're reading this message on the show

602
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:26,819
it has arrived hopefully he's got it

603
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:28,500
hung up hopefully I'm not too late

604
00:20:26,819 --> 00:20:31,259
hopefully I have still got some useful

605
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:34,648
information for you in this episode so

606
00:20:31,259 --> 00:20:36,990
you've got your h LG 600 you say this

607
00:20:34,648 --> 00:20:39,148
light is supposed to replace a 1000 watt

608
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:41,069
DE which means a double-ended bulb

609
00:20:39,148 --> 00:20:42,569
I don't know the par of my current

610
00:20:41,069 --> 00:20:45,569
lights but I know what the power of the

611
00:20:42,569 --> 00:20:48,418
h LG 600 are supposed to be and they

612
00:20:45,569 --> 00:20:50,759
recommend to put the light 24 to 30

613
00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:53,159
inches from the canopy because the par

614
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:54,778
is so high I obviously don't want to

615
00:20:53,159 --> 00:20:57,330
screw anything up since I am so far

616
00:20:54,778 --> 00:20:59,159
along any suggestions on height to start

617
00:20:57,329 --> 00:21:00,808
at the new lights and what to look for

618
00:20:59,159 --> 00:21:03,149
if the new light was to cause problems

619
00:21:00,808 --> 00:21:04,678
I'd really appreciate everything you

620
00:21:03,148 --> 00:21:07,258
have helped me with so far

621
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:09,778
keep the grow podcasts coming and then

622
00:21:07,259 --> 00:21:11,490
he signs his name hey thank you for the

623
00:21:09,778 --> 00:21:14,038
great email I promise to keep the grow

624
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:15,659
lessons coming let's focus on this new

625
00:21:14,038 --> 00:21:17,579
grow light question you've probably

626
00:21:15,659 --> 00:21:19,320
already got the light it is probably

627
00:21:17,579 --> 00:21:20,939
already hung up you've probably already

628
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:23,278
got the plants underneath there and you

629
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:25,200
were probably already doing a wonderful

630
00:21:23,278 --> 00:21:26,069
job it sounds like you were thinking and

631
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,950
you know that you need to pay attention

632
00:21:26,069 --> 00:21:30,839
so you probably paid close attention to

633
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:33,090
the plants and you saw how they reacted

634
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:34,859
and you adjusted accordingly let me tell

635
00:21:33,089 --> 00:21:36,658
you what I would have recommended had I

636
00:21:34,859 --> 00:21:39,000
read this email before you got your

637
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:40,679
light delivered I would assume and hope

638
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,839
that your new light is quite a bit more

639
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:44,580
powerful than your old light so you are

640
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:46,319
absolutely correct in thinking that you

641
00:21:44,579 --> 00:21:48,329
may need to hang that light a little bit

642
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:50,250
higher than the previous light was hung

643
00:21:48,329 --> 00:21:53,668
so if the light that was in there before

644
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:55,558
was let's say 1618 inches above the

645
00:21:53,669 --> 00:21:58,379
canopy this one you're gonna want to

646
00:21:55,558 --> 00:22:00,089
start off maybe 24 maybe 30 inches away

647
00:21:58,378 --> 00:22:02,009
from the canopy you say that they

648
00:22:00,089 --> 00:22:04,288
recommend 24 to 30 inches from the

649
00:22:02,009 --> 00:22:06,808
canopy I would start off at least that

650
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:09,089
far run the light at full power and pay

651
00:22:06,808 --> 00:22:10,500
close attention one of the things I

652
00:22:09,089 --> 00:22:12,778
should recommend you make sure to do is

653
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:14,669
to keep this light on the exact same

654
00:22:12,778 --> 00:22:16,049
cycle which your old light was on if

655
00:22:14,669 --> 00:22:18,030
you're on a flowering phase

656
00:22:16,049 --> 00:22:19,409
stay at that flowering phase don't

657
00:22:18,029 --> 00:22:21,149
change anything you're running Auto

658
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:22,920
flowers keep that light cycle the same

659
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:25,530
so that you don't disrupt anything so

660
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:26,910
that we don't have multiple variables to

661
00:22:25,529 --> 00:22:28,859
mess up our experiment so that we can

662
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:30,720
see what is happening from the new light

663
00:22:28,859 --> 00:22:33,449
so hang a blue light pay close attention

664
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:35,400
to it you need a thermometer and a

665
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:37,319
hydrometer in this environment so we can

666
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:39,210
see if that new light is heating up the

667
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:41,369
room or if it is drying out the room or

668
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:42,660
causing excessive humidity you've got a

669
00:22:41,369 --> 00:22:44,339
new light in there we need to pay

670
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:46,590
attention to what happens in the

671
00:22:44,339 --> 00:22:48,359
environment we also need to pay close

672
00:22:46,589 --> 00:22:50,189
attention to the plants you asked what

673
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:52,469
we could watch for for these plants to

674
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:53,880
see if they were frustrated we want to

675
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:55,589
pay attention to the heat if they get

676
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:58,200
too hot they will start to make what I

677
00:22:55,589 --> 00:23:00,389
call taco leaves normally the leaves

678
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:02,160
should be basically flat if they start

679
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:03,630
to curl up you'll see it when you see a

680
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:05,910
taco leaf you'll go oh that's what he

681
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:07,590
meant it starts to make like a canoe the

682
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:09,300
middle of the leaf goes a little lower

683
00:23:07,589 --> 00:23:11,159
the outer edges come up higher

684
00:23:09,299 --> 00:23:12,569
that leaf you could almost pour water in

685
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:14,580
there and it would sit right inside of

686
00:23:12,569 --> 00:23:17,039
that leaf it makes a taco or a canoe

687
00:23:14,579 --> 00:23:18,419
that is a sign of too much heat if you

688
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:20,369
were getting that you've got too much

689
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:22,019
heat you can use your thermometer and

690
00:23:20,369 --> 00:23:23,879
that indicator right there on the plants

691
00:23:22,019 --> 00:23:25,019
to see if the heat has increased to a

692
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,640
level that has made that plant

693
00:23:25,019 --> 00:23:28,440
uncomfortable if so you need to lower

694
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,690
the heat in there that is obviously the

695
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:32,400
solution there now the thing we want to

696
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:35,070
focus on after worrying about the heat

697
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,900
is do we have too much light on our

698
00:23:35,069 --> 00:23:38,119
plants did we just increase the light to

699
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:40,350
a level that makes them uncomfortable

700
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:42,239
keep an eye on the leaves of the plant

701
00:23:40,349 --> 00:23:44,039
do they start drooping do they start

702
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,259
pointing straight up those are

703
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:49,049
indicators of how happy your plants are

704
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:50,940
if the leaves begin to droop throughout

705
00:23:49,049 --> 00:23:52,889
your cycle that means they have reached

706
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:54,960
their daily light integral and they

707
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:56,790
simply can't take any more light and

708
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,470
they have put themselves to sleep you

709
00:23:56,789 --> 00:23:59,940
may see those leaves just start to droop

710
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:02,009
a little bit that is natural they're

711
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:03,660
taking a nap they're going to bed it is

712
00:24:02,009 --> 00:24:05,519
nap time they're gonna start doing their

713
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:07,620
nighttime stuff they've had enough for

714
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:09,660
the day you may be able to reduce your

715
00:24:07,619 --> 00:24:11,639
light cycle if you see that you may be

716
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:13,830
able to reduce it by an hour or so if

717
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:15,660
your light is intense enough if your new

718
00:24:13,829 --> 00:24:17,460
light is giving off enough increased

719
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:19,440
intensity your plants may be reaching

720
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:20,610
their daily light integral earlier than

721
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,830
they did before because they're

722
00:24:20,609 --> 00:24:25,409
receiving so much light so pay attention

723
00:24:22,829 --> 00:24:27,240
to the leaf if it starts to droop maybe

724
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:28,890
an hour before you're used to that is

725
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:30,000
fine that's expected that's getting

726
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:31,410
enough light it is tired

727
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,910
it's trying to take a nap it's going to

728
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:34,529
bed a little bit early that is an

729
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:37,230
indicator that you may be able to adjust

730
00:24:34,529 --> 00:24:39,660
that light cycle I am NOT an auto flower

731
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:41,430
grower I do not know enough about Auto

732
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:43,500
flowers to know if you should adjust

733
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:46,200
your light to adjust to those plants

734
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:47,700
that is not my expertise I don't know if

735
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:49,410
you will answer your questions the

736
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:51,569
person I think of when I say Auto

737
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:53,640
flowers is mephisto genetics that is who

738
00:24:51,569 --> 00:24:55,589
I would recommend and suggest and all

739
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:57,480
things Auto flower so take your auto

740
00:24:55,589 --> 00:24:58,740
flower questions to Mephisto he may be

741
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:00,660
able to give you more details on that

742
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:02,670
but let's talk about this light because

743
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:03,960
I do understand this part the first

744
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:06,150
thing you're gonna see is leaves

745
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:07,559
drooping or leaves pointing up you need

746
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:09,570
to pay attention to the leaves if they

747
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:11,309
start drooping away early that means

748
00:25:09,569 --> 00:25:12,960
that you are giving it too much light I

749
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:14,609
mean like within an hour of putting on

750
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,319
putting the light above those plants

751
00:25:14,609 --> 00:25:17,669
they should not droop if you see them

752
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:19,679
droop that means they are getting too

753
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:21,480
much light and they're frustrated over a

754
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:23,190
couple of days if your leaves begin to

755
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:24,990
twist that means they are getting too

756
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:26,700
much light and they are pissed off too

757
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:28,440
much light is kind of a rare thing I

758
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:30,330
don't know that you can do it with an

759
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:33,059
indoor light setup you're going from an

760
00:25:30,329 --> 00:25:35,159
LED to an LED your plants should be

761
00:25:33,059 --> 00:25:36,990
excited about this they should be happy

762
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:39,090
with it I would put that light up there

763
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:40,410
and pay attention to them hang it as

764
00:25:39,089 --> 00:25:42,779
high as you can get it within reason

765
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:45,180
start off it says 25 let's see it says

766
00:25:42,779 --> 00:25:47,819
24 to 30 inches above the canopy start

767
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:49,650
at 36 inches run it for two hours see

768
00:25:47,819 --> 00:25:51,269
what the plants do check on the humidity

769
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:52,950
check on the temperature see if

770
00:25:51,269 --> 00:25:54,930
everything is right while we're at six

771
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:56,759
inches pay attention to the plants run

772
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:58,080
it for a couple of hours like that keep

773
00:25:56,759 --> 00:25:59,609
an eye on the plants you're the one that

774
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:01,799
knows those plants you should be able to

775
00:25:59,609 --> 00:26:03,029
see how they are reacting you've been

776
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:05,129
working with these plants for their

777
00:26:03,029 --> 00:26:06,809
entire veg phase plus two weeks of

778
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:08,370
flower now you should have a good idea

779
00:26:06,809 --> 00:26:09,960
of what these plants look like in the

780
00:26:08,369 --> 00:26:11,309
morning when they wake up you should

781
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,930
know what these plants look like in the

782
00:26:11,309 --> 00:26:14,250
mid-afternoon when you do your afternoon

783
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:15,539
check and you should know what the

784
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:17,880
plants look like when it is almost

785
00:26:15,539 --> 00:26:20,129
bedtime when you do the before bed check

786
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:21,930
on your plants so keep those things in

787
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:24,360
mind and compare that to how the plant

788
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:26,039
is reacting with this new light the main

789
00:26:24,359 --> 00:26:27,809
things you're gonna watch for is the

790
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:29,819
leaves are the leaves drooping are they

791
00:26:27,809 --> 00:26:31,740
falling off do the plants look sad does

792
00:26:29,819 --> 00:26:33,899
it look over watered does it start to

793
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:34,980
curl downward or upward those are signs

794
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:36,960
of too much light

795
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:38,670
now if the whole tip top of the plant

796
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,380
starts bending over it is trying to get

797
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:41,880
away from the light it is cooking you

798
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:42,600
definitely need to raise the light or

799
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:45,000
reduce

800
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:47,129
power at that point I think since you're

801
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,390
going from led to an improved LED your

802
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:50,160
plants are going to be happy they're

803
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:52,169
going to like it the things you need to

804
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:54,419
pay close attention to are the leaves

805
00:26:52,169 --> 00:26:55,470
the next thing to think about is the VPD

806
00:26:54,419 --> 00:26:57,660
in that room

807
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:58,919
have you changed the VPD by changing the

808
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:00,330
light I bet you are getting a whole

809
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:01,890
different temperature you're getting a

810
00:27:00,329 --> 00:27:03,089
different humidity you were getting a

811
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:05,370
lot of different changes that you're

812
00:27:03,089 --> 00:27:07,048
going to re need to dial that room in

813
00:27:05,369 --> 00:27:09,869
you need to readjust all of your climate

814
00:27:07,048 --> 00:27:12,480
controls if possible another thing you

815
00:27:09,869 --> 00:27:14,548
can do is grab those plants and see what

816
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,710
they feel like what is the leaf surface

817
00:27:14,548 --> 00:27:18,750
temperature in your garden do the plants

818
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:20,640
feel cold do they feel too hot do you

819
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:22,740
see the plants physically sweating if

820
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,450
they are sweating they're too hot they

821
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:25,679
need to be separated you don't want them

822
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:27,808
touching in there that's a whole nother

823
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:29,730
subject but you can tell by looking at

824
00:27:27,808 --> 00:27:31,619
the plants how they are liking or hating

825
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:33,210
this new light if they are drooping if

826
00:27:31,619 --> 00:27:34,859
they look angry they obviously don't

827
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:37,259
like the new light if over a couple of

828
00:27:34,859 --> 00:27:39,209
days the leaves start to twist and curl

829
00:27:37,259 --> 00:27:41,339
they absolutely do not like this new

830
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:43,440
light I think like I said before since

831
00:27:41,339 --> 00:27:45,629
you went from an LED to an upgraded LED

832
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,730
these plants should be happy start out

833
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:50,070
about 36 inches give them a couple of

834
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:51,599
hours drop it down to the 30 mark give

835
00:27:50,069 --> 00:27:54,149
it a couple of hours see how they react

836
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:55,829
maybe go to 24 inches see how they react

837
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:57,240
if you don't see any adverse reactions

838
00:27:55,829 --> 00:27:58,769
maybe go a little lower

839
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:00,150
I don't know how low you want to go with

840
00:27:58,769 --> 00:28:02,158
the LEDs I don't know where there are

841
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:03,690
there's a distance where you kind of it

842
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:05,700
becomes a point of diminishing returns

843
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:07,200
when you get your plants too close to

844
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:09,179
the bulb because that super-intense

845
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,470
coming off of AB light bulb there isn't

846
00:28:09,179 --> 00:28:12,080
even usable by the plants you got to

847
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:14,220
back it up to make it usable so

848
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:16,019
experiment that is the best way to learn

849
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:18,509
start off too high work your way down

850
00:28:16,019 --> 00:28:20,129
get too low watch the plants react to it

851
00:28:18,509 --> 00:28:21,869
if you start seeing what I call they get

852
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:23,400
their nails done just the tips of the

853
00:28:21,869 --> 00:28:25,259
leaves start to look like [ __ ] that is a

854
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:27,000
good sign that you are giving them too

855
00:28:25,259 --> 00:28:29,490
much light now what will happen if you

856
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,750
continue to develop buds the buds will

857
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:32,880
get bigger they'll grow into the light

858
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:34,409
then those tips of the buds will start

859
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,059
to bleach themselves we've seen that in

860
00:28:34,409 --> 00:28:38,130
a few magazines when it just looks like

861
00:28:36,058 --> 00:28:39,899
a little white tip on the top of the bud

862
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:41,760
or the top of the bud is just bleached

863
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:43,350
that is from the plant being exposed to

864
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:45,359
too much light during the flowering

865
00:28:43,349 --> 00:28:46,259
cycle it simply bleached the chlorophyll

866
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:48,209
out of the plant

867
00:28:46,259 --> 00:28:50,250
and that can absolutely happen with your

868
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:52,110
LEDs I don't think you're going to have

869
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:53,759
a problem I'm looking at this light

870
00:28:52,109 --> 00:28:56,099
right now on the website this is a great

871
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:58,379
light this is a high quality light

872
00:28:56,099 --> 00:29:01,439
hlg if i can get you to send me one of

873
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:03,660
these what do we have here at hlg 600h i

874
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,970
would gladly replace one of my thousand

875
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:08,790
watt HBS lights i would run it side by

876
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:11,700
side and we can see what's your h LG 600

877
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:13,440
versus my current HP s setup does i

878
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:14,880
would love to work with you let's do

879
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,470
that I'm just throwing out a shameless

880
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,060
plug through the podcaster this does

881
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:19,920
look like a wonderful light it is a

882
00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:21,869
quite pricy light but it is going to

883
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:24,000
save you money in electricity and in

884
00:29:21,869 --> 00:29:25,739
cooling costs I think you are going to

885
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,750
love this light congratulations on the

886
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:29,339
great purchase I really hope this does a

887
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:31,319
great upgrade for your grow room

888
00:29:29,339 --> 00:29:33,359
you just turbocharged your whole setup

889
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:35,099
since you had the forethought to ask

890
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:36,750
this question I think you were going to

891
00:29:35,099 --> 00:29:38,099
be right on top of paying attention to

892
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:39,569
your plants and knowing if they have

893
00:29:38,099 --> 00:29:42,149
gotten too close to the light I think

894
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:44,069
you were already for thinking you were

895
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:45,660
prepared and you know what to look for I

896
00:29:44,069 --> 00:29:48,029
hope I gave you enough helpful advice

897
