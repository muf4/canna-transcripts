turn down this music here and we're

86
00:02:47,139 --> 00:02:51,429
gonna talk a little bit about let's see

87
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:53,349
I've been growing in Cocoa lately I've

88
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:55,030
made the switch I'd land a few pots at

89
00:02:53,349 --> 00:02:57,459
the big grow with nothing but cocoa in

90
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:59,530
there and I am really liking it you guys

91
00:02:57,459 --> 00:03:01,090
it seems like I'm watering a little bit

92
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:03,250
more frequently but one thing I've

93
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:05,800
noticed is that I cannot over water the

94
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:07,060
plants that are in the cocoa I've been

95
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,569
doing a couple of experiments I've got

96
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,519
one pot

97
00:03:07,568 --> 00:03:11,768
set aside from all the other pots and

98
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,299
when I water I give this one pot double

99
00:03:11,769 --> 00:03:15,489
or triple what every other plant gets

100
00:03:13,299 --> 00:03:17,139
and it does not ever show signs of

101
00:03:15,489 --> 00:03:19,180
stress from being over watered so that's

102
00:03:17,139 --> 00:03:20,499
something I like there are some times

103
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:22,299
when I know I'm not gonna get back to

104
00:03:20,498 --> 00:03:24,128
the grow first thing in the morning so I

105
00:03:22,299 --> 00:03:26,139
will just heavily heavily water those

106
00:03:24,128 --> 00:03:28,358
plants and I felt like when I was

107
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:29,859
running soil sometimes I would flood

108
00:03:28,359 --> 00:03:31,540
those plants so much that I could see

109
00:03:29,859 --> 00:03:33,489
them getting droopy and being angry from

110
00:03:31,539 --> 00:03:35,378
being over watered that never happens

111
00:03:33,489 --> 00:03:37,419
with the cocoa so I'm able to flood

112
00:03:35,378 --> 00:03:38,949
these plants and they don't get pissed

113
00:03:37,419 --> 00:03:41,379
off from being over watered but it does

114
00:03:38,949 --> 00:03:42,848
feel like my regular watering schedule I

115
00:03:41,378 --> 00:03:44,408
need to hit them a little bit more

116
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:45,608
frequently I've had to increase the

117
00:03:44,408 --> 00:03:47,229
amount of water that I give them because

118
00:03:45,609 --> 00:03:49,599
they are drying out a little bit more

119
00:03:47,229 --> 00:03:51,098
quickly one thing I've noticed with

120
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:53,649
cocoa one thing I should mention with

121
00:03:51,098 --> 00:03:54,908
cocoa there are no nutrients in cocoa if

122
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,379
you're just using straight cocoa there's

123
00:03:54,908 --> 00:03:57,519
nothing there to keep your plant going

124
00:03:56,378 --> 00:03:59,948
so you're going to need to feed it

125
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:02,709
nutrients almost every watering I've

126
00:03:59,949 --> 00:04:05,620
been giving it lots of nutrients and I

127
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:09,188
do about so I water the plants twice a

128
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:10,629
day I'll do nutrients nutrients that's

129
00:04:09,188 --> 00:04:11,978
two waters in one day nutrients

130
00:04:10,628 --> 00:04:13,508
nutrients the next I'll go nutrients

131
00:04:11,979 --> 00:04:15,220
nutrients and then I'll go nutrients and

132
00:04:13,508 --> 00:04:16,478
then the watering before I leave on the

133
00:04:15,219 --> 00:04:18,459
third day I usually just hit almost

134
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:20,199
clean water so they're getting a lot of

135
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:22,030
nutrients they don't look I don't see

136
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:24,400
any deficiencies I don't see any over

137
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:26,649
nutrients they don't look mad from being

138
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:27,519
over watered I'm really liking the cocoa

139
00:04:26,649 --> 00:04:29,379
you guys one thing I should mention

140
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:31,180
don't let your cocoa dry out once you

141
00:04:29,379 --> 00:04:32,949
see the top layer of cocoa drying out

142
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:34,389
that's when you're in danger of your

143
00:04:32,949 --> 00:04:36,908
plants getting a little bit too dry it

144
00:04:34,389 --> 00:04:38,740
happens very quickly on cocoa the time

145
00:04:36,908 --> 00:04:40,300
frame when you walk in to a soil grow

146
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:41,769
and you see your plants drooping they're

147
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,060
kind of starting to get pissed off if

148
00:04:41,769 --> 00:04:44,288
they're drooping in cocoa they're

149
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:45,639
[ __ ] angry that's one thing I've

150
00:04:44,288 --> 00:04:47,050
noticed I've been doing some experiments

151
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:48,848
and I'm learning so that you guys don't

152
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:50,680
have to kill plants to learn I've got

153
00:04:48,848 --> 00:04:52,860
more access I've got more space so we're

154
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:55,030
learning with cocoa I really do like it

155
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:58,960
this kind of segues into something else

156
00:04:55,029 --> 00:05:00,728
I want to talk about over watering I see

157
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:02,019
a lot of people and a lot of grows over

158
00:05:00,728 --> 00:05:03,788
watering their plants and they are

159
00:05:02,019 --> 00:05:06,098
wondering why the growth of their plant

160
00:05:03,788 --> 00:05:08,680
is stunted there is something that

161
00:05:06,098 --> 00:05:09,668
happens when the soil starts to dry out

162
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,519
a little bit or when you're medium

163
00:05:09,668 --> 00:05:14,978
starts to dry out a bit the moisture to

164
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:16,959
oxygen ratio in there really makes your

165
00:05:14,978 --> 00:05:18,370
roots want to grow it really makes your

166
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:19,689
roots want to eat so they start

167
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:20,889
searching for nutrients they start

168
00:05:19,689 --> 00:05:22,740
growing a little bit this

169
00:05:20,889 --> 00:05:25,079
really makes your plants get active I

170
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:28,180
have noticed that when I used to run

171
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:29,438
clones in root cubes or rock wool I

172
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:31,209
would notice that my clones would

173
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:33,009
actually root the best when I would

174
00:05:31,209 --> 00:05:34,778
forget about them and the cloners and

175
00:05:33,009 --> 00:05:37,120
The Rock will cube would dry up a little

176
00:05:34,778 --> 00:05:39,310
bit I really think that that dryness is

177
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,930
what the plants are looking for a little

178
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:44,379
bit more than the wetness you don't want

179
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:46,150
to be soggy all the time so it's kind of

180
00:05:44,379 --> 00:05:47,620
a good idea to give your plants a short

181
00:05:46,149 --> 00:05:50,138
dry out period you don't want them

182
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:51,218
getting wilty and crispy but keep an eye

183
00:05:50,139 --> 00:05:52,598
on your plant water your plants

184
00:05:51,218 --> 00:05:54,490
thoroughly and then keep an eye on them

185
00:05:52,598 --> 00:05:56,228
and watch you'll see right when they

186
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:57,519
start to droop a little bit that's when

187
00:05:56,228 --> 00:05:59,258
you need to give them water so start

188
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:01,568
learning right before that happens and

189
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:02,860
then start feeding them right before

190
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:04,000
that right before they start to droop

191
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:05,680
that's when you should be given a water

192
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,990
every time so that you allow that dry

193
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,459
out phase something that happens in that

194
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:11,490
dry out phase that we've talked about on

195
00:06:09,459 --> 00:06:14,168
this podcast several episodes back as

196
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:16,478
the moisture level in your root zone

197
00:06:14,168 --> 00:06:18,758
changes as the water level in your soil

198
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:21,699
ball in your coco area as that moisture

199
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:24,158
level changes so will the pH so if

200
00:06:21,699 --> 00:06:26,650
you're feeding your plants a nutrient

201
00:06:24,158 --> 00:06:28,688
solution that's real high-end pH you

202
00:06:26,649 --> 00:06:30,429
pour it in there only certain nutrients

203
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:33,069
are going to be available at that pH

204
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:35,348
level but as the moisture level and

205
00:06:33,069 --> 00:06:36,968
temperature change inside of that soil

206
00:06:35,348 --> 00:06:38,918
ball inside that rhizosphere

207
00:06:36,968 --> 00:06:41,199
inside your pot in your container there

208
00:06:38,918 --> 00:06:43,299
the pH will change and different

209
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,189
nutrients will become bioavailable to

210
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:47,110
your plants so there are several

211
00:06:45,189 --> 00:06:48,399
advantages to letting your plants dry

212
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:50,649
out just a little bit I don't want you

213
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:52,060
to let them get crispy but it is good

214
00:06:50,649 --> 00:06:54,430
for your plants to dry out just a little

215
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:57,038
bit you'll see much more production this

216
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:59,978
is why I like to put my mother plants in

217
00:06:57,038 --> 00:07:01,418
root pots or air pots or earth pots any

218
00:06:59,978 --> 00:07:03,728
type of fabric pot that they can breathe

219
00:07:01,418 --> 00:07:04,930
a whole bunch or they make those plastic

220
00:07:03,728 --> 00:07:06,399
pots that have a bunch of holes in them

221
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:08,889
that have like the dimpled shapes on

222
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:10,778
them I really like that

223
00:07:08,889 --> 00:07:12,819
because I feel like your roots get a lot

224
00:07:10,778 --> 00:07:14,649
of oxygen and then if you're using that

225
00:07:12,819 --> 00:07:16,479
in Cocoa your roots are going to be

226
00:07:14,649 --> 00:07:18,399
surrounded by oxygen and they're going

227
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:21,128
to grow rapidly and your plants will

228
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:23,079
love it so that is my take on cocoa and

229
00:07:21,129 --> 00:07:25,060
kind of a segue into letting your plants

230
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:27,550
dry out a little bit I love cocoa you

231
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:29,528
got to use more nutrients you definitely

232
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:33,158
need more Cal and more mag with cocoa

233
00:07:29,528 --> 00:07:34,810
more Cal mag heavily with cocoa and then

234
00:07:33,158 --> 00:07:36,909
if you're using soil

235
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:38,980
or cocoa or a soilless makes it a good

236
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:40,510
idea to kind of let your plants dry up

237
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:43,210
just a little bit alright that was a

238
00:07:40,509 --> 00:07:44,469
quick talk quick ramble about how I feel

239
00:07:43,209 --> 00:07:47,079
about cocoa and what I've learned about

240
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:49,000
letting the plants dry a little bit so

241
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:50,800
um let's move into the next part I want

242
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,800
to talk about collecting pollen you guys

243
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,970
yesterday I spent a couple of hours

244
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,410
working with a male plant if you've been

245
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:59,260
following my social media you know that

246
00:07:56,410 --> 00:08:01,090
I've gotten a rise mail from a rise f1

247
00:07:59,259 --> 00:08:03,730
seed he's a male plant that looks like a

248
00:08:01,089 --> 00:08:06,939
true stud he plans I plan on using him

249
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:08,950
as my breeding stud I took him to about

250
00:08:06,939 --> 00:08:10,120
eight weeks of flour and a flowering

251
00:08:08,949 --> 00:08:11,680
room to see what he would do and

252
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:14,230
yesterday I cut him down but before I

253
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,639
did I collected the pollen now here is

254
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:17,590
how I collected the palme there are

255
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:19,269
several methods to doing this I actually

256
00:08:17,589 --> 00:08:21,159
used a couple of different techniques to

257
00:08:19,269 --> 00:08:23,079
see what I liked better just cuz I

258
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:24,580
wanted to talk about it on the show the

259
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:26,439
way I started you guys I was holding a

260
00:08:24,579 --> 00:08:28,209
mason jar and I was just going to the

261
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:29,350
bottom buds and I grabbed a drumstick

262
00:08:28,209 --> 00:08:30,759
because I'm the drummer I grabbed the

263
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:33,700
drumstick and I was just tapping the

264
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:36,129
male buds over the jar and pollen was

265
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:38,169
falling into the jar and I liked it it

266
00:08:36,129 --> 00:08:39,759
was working but I felt that a bunch of

267
00:08:38,168 --> 00:08:41,978
the pollen was missing the jars I was

268
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:43,538
tapping the bud pollen was falling down

269
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:45,639
the side of the jar pollen was falling

270
00:08:43,538 --> 00:08:47,199
on my hand the site of the bud that

271
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:49,240
didn't have a jar near it there was just

272
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,650
pollen falling onto the floor there was

273
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,029
plenty of pollen collected but I felt

274
00:08:50,649 --> 00:08:53,889
like I was wasting a lot so I had this

275
00:08:52,029 --> 00:08:55,600
jar and I'm just tapping buds and I'm

276
00:08:53,889 --> 00:08:58,269
tapping the buds the pollen into the jar

277
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:01,000
I got a lot the next method that I tried

278
00:08:58,269 --> 00:09:03,549
was I cut the buds off of the plant and

279
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:07,059
I just laid the male flowers the buds

280
00:09:03,549 --> 00:09:09,159
with the male flowers onto a glass tray

281
00:09:07,059 --> 00:09:11,379
and then I was just tapping them with my

282
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:13,149
finger and what I was noticing was a

283
00:09:11,379 --> 00:09:14,889
bunch more pollen was falling off and

284
00:09:13,149 --> 00:09:16,509
landing directly onto the tray and I

285
00:09:14,889 --> 00:09:18,879
wasn't losing as much the only problem

286
00:09:16,509 --> 00:09:21,939
there was I was gathering a whole bunch

287
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:23,980
of male flowers so what I had to do was

288
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:25,150
sift out the male flowers from the

289
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,649
pollen because you don't want to leave

290
00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:27,850
those male flowers in there if you store

291
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:29,860
it with those male flowers in there

292
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:31,779
there is a chance that those male

293
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:33,430
flowers have moisture in them and they

294
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:35,169
will mildew up inside of your jar and

295
00:09:33,429 --> 00:09:36,909
moisture is one of your biggest enemies

296
00:09:35,169 --> 00:09:38,949
to pollen we're gonna talk about that

297
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:40,419
here in just a minute so what I found to

298
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:42,790
be the most successful was taking them

299
00:09:40,419 --> 00:09:44,019
the chopping of the tops I just chopped

300
00:09:42,789 --> 00:09:45,939
the top right off the male plant and I

301
00:09:44,019 --> 00:09:46,480
set it on a glass tray and just tapped

302
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,589
it

303
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,028
and I just tapped it for a couple good

304
00:09:47,589 --> 00:09:51,010
minutes I was tapping it kind of hard

305
00:09:49,028 --> 00:09:52,419
and then I could just see the pollen

306
00:09:51,009 --> 00:09:54,429
falling out of the buds and then I

307
00:09:52,419 --> 00:09:55,539
turned it over and did it again then I

308
00:09:54,429 --> 00:09:56,979
picked it up and kind of tapped it with

309
00:09:55,539 --> 00:09:58,980
my finger to knock off any pollen that

310
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:01,839
stuck and then I just threw that big old

311
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:03,879
pollen what I do just pull and remove

312
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:07,269
the bud just threw that part right into

313
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:08,919
the trash so I felt it sending it on the

314
00:10:07,269 --> 00:10:10,600
Tran tapping it was my best method for

315
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:13,328
collecting pollen however I did get all

316
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:14,680
those male plants so I just used felt

317
00:10:13,328 --> 00:10:17,439
kind of sketchy but I just used an old

318
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:20,469
ID on a plate and just separated the

319
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,970
male flowers from the pollen I kind of

320
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:23,620
felt like a cross between when you used

321
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:25,149
to pick seeds out of schwag weed and

322
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:26,649
also when you used to use a credit card

323
00:10:25,149 --> 00:10:28,778
to do bad drugs it's kind of what it

324
00:10:26,649 --> 00:10:31,028
felt like so I was a weird feeling but

325
00:10:28,778 --> 00:10:33,399
it was definitely I worked it worked

326
00:10:31,028 --> 00:10:35,259
very well so I've got a mason jar with a

327
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:37,028
nice like two-inch layer of a rise

328
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:38,708
pollen in the bottom of it and I do plan

329
00:10:37,028 --> 00:10:41,230
on making some crosses with the Rise and

330
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:43,599
I also plan on making and a rise f2 in

331
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:45,190
the future here so look out for some

332
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,449
seeds coming up for my region etics in

333
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:48,100
the very near future I'll need some

334
00:10:46,448 --> 00:10:50,859
testers I need you guys to run those for

335
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:51,850
me and tell me what they do and I'm

336
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,169
gonna get a bunch of messages from

337
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:54,579
people who want to be testers that's

338
00:10:53,169 --> 00:10:55,958
cool I could deal with that I'm very

339
00:10:54,578 --> 00:10:57,729
selective on testers you guys so when it

340
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:59,409
comes time to test seeds you need to

341
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:00,610
have an impressive resume if you want to

342
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:01,899
be a tester for me because I need to

343
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:04,720
know what's truly going on with these

344
00:11:01,899 --> 00:11:06,068
plants I need reliable testers when the

345
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,360
time comes I will talk about that on the

346
00:11:06,068 --> 00:11:09,219
show it's not time for testers yet

347
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,539
alright another method that I was using

348
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:12,190
to try to collect the pollen that I

349
00:11:10,539 --> 00:11:13,539
didn't find to be very successful was I

350
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:15,339
was cutting the branch off that had the

351
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:16,778
male flowers on it and just cutting it

352
00:11:15,339 --> 00:11:19,149
into six or eight inch sections and

353
00:11:16,778 --> 00:11:20,919
holding actually kind of dipping that

354
00:11:19,149 --> 00:11:22,990
into a mason jar and then tapping it at

355
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:24,639
the base of the stalk and it was working

356
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:26,409
but I was not able to knock off enough

357
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:27,909
pollen to make it worth my time and I

358
00:11:26,409 --> 00:11:29,588
was also knocking off a bunch of male

359
00:11:27,909 --> 00:11:30,939
flowers into the mason jar which meant

360
00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:33,100
that I had to pour that back out onto

361
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:35,319
the plate anyway to sift it so it wasn't

362
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:38,620
really I didn't find it to be effective

363
00:11:35,318 --> 00:11:40,990
so I think the best method was to put if

364
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:42,250
you've got a giant mirror or if you're a

365
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:44,680
drummer and you've got an old kick drum

366
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:46,179
head just drop an ugh the male plant

367
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:47,588
right down onto the giant mirror and

368
00:11:46,179 --> 00:11:48,849
just tap on it and all the pollen will

369
00:11:47,589 --> 00:11:51,910
fall off and then you use a credit card

370
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:53,740
or an old ID just to scrape it up it's

371
00:11:51,909 --> 00:11:55,120
easy to collect pollen so once you've

372
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:56,980
got your pollen you're going to need to

373
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,870
store your pollen I recommend putting it

374
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:00,610
in a mason jar and then I like to put

375
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:02,649
that mason jar in a brown paper bag to

376
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:05,169
keep it dark and then I put all of that

377
00:12:02,649 --> 00:12:07,240
inside of the refrigerator carefully

378
00:12:05,169 --> 00:12:10,328
label your jars of pollen II guys that's

379
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:12,669
really important my jar says a rise f-1

380
00:12:10,328 --> 00:12:14,649
pollen collected five five sixteen

381
00:12:12,669 --> 00:12:16,088
that's easy enough I know that that's a

382
00:12:14,649 --> 00:12:18,429
Rhys pollen and I know when it was

383
00:12:16,089 --> 00:12:20,260
collected I've never really tried to

384
00:12:18,429 --> 00:12:22,539
store pollen for too long I always use

385
00:12:20,259 --> 00:12:25,179
it kind of soon I could imagine it would

386
00:12:22,539 --> 00:12:28,240
last a few months maybe but I'm honestly

387
00:12:25,179 --> 00:12:29,948
not sure if it's properly stored six

388
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,139
months maybe a year I don't want to lie

389
00:12:29,948 --> 00:12:33,759
to you if you've got information on how

390
00:12:32,139 --> 00:12:35,799
long if you've had pollen stored for a

391
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:37,809
long time and you used it and it worked

392
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:39,990
send me an email grow from your heart at

393
00:12:37,809 --> 00:12:42,489
hotmail.com I want to hear your pollen

394
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:43,870
methods on how long and how you apply

395
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:45,669
pollen I wonder how long you keep it

396
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:47,528
before you apply it and now what the

397
00:12:45,669 --> 00:12:49,688
oldest viable pollen you ever had was

398
00:12:47,528 --> 00:12:50,769
that's what I want to know all right so

399
00:12:49,688 --> 00:12:52,778
you've collected a bunch of pollen

400
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:54,220
you've got it in a mason jar it's well

401
00:12:52,778 --> 00:12:55,568
labeled it's been stored in the fridge

402
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:57,790
for a little bit here's something I must

403
00:12:55,568 --> 00:13:00,610
have mentioned do not get your pollen

404
00:12:57,789 --> 00:13:03,250
wet in any way shape or form Moisture is

405
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:04,060
pollens worst enemy a lot of people ask

406
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,950
me they're like

407
00:13:04,059 --> 00:13:07,569
bro you breed and you grow seedless

408
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:09,310
flowers in the same facility

409
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:11,650
aren't you scared having that male

410
00:13:09,309 --> 00:13:13,089
flower around or that male plant around

411
00:13:11,649 --> 00:13:14,470
that's just spitting pollen aren't you

412
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:18,730
worried about seating up all of your

413
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:20,410
females um sometimes [ __ ] happens yes

414
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:21,430
sometimes I have grown crops it were

415
00:13:20,409 --> 00:13:22,959
meant to be seedless and I've

416
00:13:21,429 --> 00:13:24,489
accidentally discovered a whole bunch of

417
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:26,350
seeds in there and it was because I had

418
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:27,639
a male plant in the same area and it

419
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:31,120
just got cross pollinated

420
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:34,330
but the secret is water deactivates

421
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:36,519
pollen II guys so I've got two separate

422
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:38,110
areas one's got a male plant one's got

423
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:40,269
female plants the female plants are in

424
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:42,250
flower and completely able to accept

425
00:13:40,269 --> 00:13:43,870
pollen they're still in there of ulation

426
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:46,360
phase they can accept pollen they can

427
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:47,769
make seeds they could become seated they

428
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:50,440
can they're gonna grow long enough to

429
00:13:47,769 --> 00:13:51,879
make viable seed the way that I prevent

430
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:54,340
them from being seeded when I mess with

431
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:56,110
my male plant so yesterday I was playing

432
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:58,300
with a male plant about 30 feet away

433
00:13:56,110 --> 00:14:01,360
from those female plants what I did was

434
00:13:58,299 --> 00:14:02,769
I took a like my backpack sprayer that I

435
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,330
would apply pesticides or follow your

436
00:14:02,769 --> 00:14:06,220
feet in there I just mixed up some water

437
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:08,950
in there just straight clean water i pH

438
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:10,960
hit at 6.5 and I sprayed that all over

439
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:12,580
my female plants and then I went I

440
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:14,860
played with my male plant in a separate

441
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:16,900
area I collected all the pollen from him

442
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:18,460
then I cleaned up I threw away all the

443
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:20,799
trash I threw away the pot I threw away

444
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:22,750
not the pot like the the container I

445
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:24,609
threw away the container I threw all the

446
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:25,860
dirt I cleaned up I swept up that room I

447
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:28,180
cleaned up the room where the mail was

448
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:29,379
then I took the clothes that I was

449
00:14:28,179 --> 00:14:31,389
wearing and I walked straight to a

450
00:14:29,379 --> 00:14:32,820
washing machine I took the clothes off

451
00:14:31,389 --> 00:14:35,439
and threw them into a washing machine

452
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:38,170
then I walked myself directly to a

453
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:41,080
shower and I hosed myself down including

454
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:43,449
you guys I am 6 foot 5 and I have got

455
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:45,610
dreadlocks almost to my knees my

456
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:47,830
dreadlocks are mid thigh region and I

457
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:49,269
had to run to a shower and just rinse my

458
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:51,040
whole self down so I did go wash the

459
00:14:49,269 --> 00:14:54,519
dreads had to go wash the beard just

460
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:56,439
wouldn't scrub myself I feel that the

461
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:58,569
water I applied to those female plants

462
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:00,010
made them unable it was a little bit of

463
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:01,990
birth control it made them unable to

464
00:15:00,009 --> 00:15:03,970
collect pollen the pollen was not

465
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:05,680
allowed to land on the pistil and move

466
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:08,139
into the ovule because the water was in

467
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:09,699
the way I also feel that any water or

468
00:15:08,139 --> 00:15:11,350
any pollen that was on myself and my

469
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:13,480
clothes was destroyed as soon as it hit

470
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:14,710
the water I carried those clothes up to

471
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,170
the washing machine I threw him in the

472
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:17,830
washing machine turn on the water

473
00:15:16,169 --> 00:15:19,179
even the Hat that I was

474
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:20,590
whirring got thrown into that washing

475
00:15:19,179 --> 00:15:22,719
machine so all the clothes got washed

476
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:26,050
the Hat got washed then the dreadlocks

477
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:28,240
got washed i got washed and then before

478
00:15:26,049 --> 00:15:29,949
i went back into the grow room with the

479
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,289
females i went and grabbed my sprayer

480
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:34,390
again and i sprayed it in front of me as

481
00:15:32,289 --> 00:15:36,099
i walked into that room so there was

482
00:15:34,389 --> 00:15:37,539
water landing on those plants before i

483
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,259
got into there is kind of what i was

484
00:15:37,539 --> 00:15:40,750
aiming for

485
00:15:38,259 --> 00:15:42,429
i'm pretty sure that these plants will

486
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:44,740
not be seated the female plants that i

487
00:15:42,429 --> 00:15:46,120
was messing with and yesterday after i

488
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:48,730
played with my male plant i went took

489
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:51,460
pictures of the girls i am 99% sure that

490
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:54,340
I did not see them it's all about water

491
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:57,430
you guys I have seen people set up a

492
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:58,600
screen like a screen door so you open up

493
00:15:57,429 --> 00:16:00,129
your grow room door then there's a

494
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:02,350
screen door and they've got water

495
00:16:00,129 --> 00:16:04,360
running down that screen door there's a

496
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:05,620
little mr. spring water right at the top

497
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,990
and it collects on the screen and runs

498
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:10,299
down that is their pollen catch they

499
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:12,629
also sell a UV light that will kill

500
00:16:10,299 --> 00:16:15,099
pollen that goes in your ducting so if

501
00:16:12,629 --> 00:16:16,389
pollen comes in it goes through this UV

502
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,620
light that goes through your ducting and

503
00:16:16,389 --> 00:16:19,990
then it is just killed right there it's

504
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:21,820
neutralized so pollen isn't as scary as

505
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:23,919
a lot of people like to think water will

506
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:25,390
destroy pollen if you were afraid of

507
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:26,889
pollinating your plants just apply a

508
00:16:25,389 --> 00:16:28,929
little bit of water and you should be

509
00:16:26,889 --> 00:16:30,879
safe alright if you guys are playing

510
00:16:28,929 --> 00:16:33,069
with pollen and female plants and male

511
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:34,990
plants in a in a small area in a house

512
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:37,600
and a home grow the first couple of

513
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:39,279
times expect to get some seeds it takes

514
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,560
one little tiny speck of pollen to make

515
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:43,389
a seed and pollen is so tiny you can't

516
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:44,500
get it all off of you unless you kind of

517
00:16:43,389 --> 00:16:45,970
have some experience you know what

518
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:48,639
you're doing so don't be surprised if

519
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:50,350
you pollinate your crop on accident you

520
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,669
guys have been going for 17 minutes now

521
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:53,050
and you can hear the dryness in my

522
00:16:51,669 --> 00:16:54,969
throat so I'm gonna take a quick drink

523
00:16:53,049 --> 00:16:59,679

555
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:56,980
so recently I was called to a place

556
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:58,060
where this guy had powdery mildew and he

557
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:00,849
could not figure out what was causing

558
00:17:58,059 --> 00:18:03,429
the powdery mildew the problem was that

559
00:18:00,849 --> 00:18:05,649
he was not getting rid of his old stale

560
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:07,840
air I talk about this a lot you need to

561
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:09,310
remove the stagnant air from your grow

562
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:10,629
room you need to get rid of that extra

563
00:18:09,309 --> 00:18:11,919
humidity you need to get rid of that old

564
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:13,360
moisture you need to get it out of the

565
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:15,430
room and get some fresh air in there

566
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:17,259
this guy is failing to do that in his

567
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:19,360
area and he is getting powdery mildew

568
00:18:17,259 --> 00:18:21,490
we've tried a few things to get rid of

569
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:22,899
the powdery mildew we've applied a

570
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:24,849
couple of products that seem to be

571
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:26,350
working but unfortunately he had to

572
00:18:24,849 --> 00:18:30,009
harvest a little bit early because the

573
00:18:26,349 --> 00:18:31,179
PM was over taking a couple of plants so

574
00:18:30,009 --> 00:18:32,890
let me tell you a little bit about what

575
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:34,539
we tried to get rid of this powdery

576
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:35,920
mildew awhile back when I first

577
00:18:34,539 --> 00:18:37,450
discovered the powdery mildew in this

578
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:40,360
guy's garden I started applying a

579
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:42,250
product called stylet oil it's JMS style

580
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:44,529
and oil it seemed to be working very

581
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:46,390
well it was knocking the PM off of the

582
00:18:44,529 --> 00:18:47,829
leaves we couldn't see any on there it

583
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:49,600
wouldn't come back for quite some time

584
00:18:47,829 --> 00:18:52,240
but we had to keep spraying at about

585
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:53,679
once a week to keep the PM away and I

586
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,289
really didn't want to spray this stuff

587
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:57,789
on heavy chunky buds cuz I could tell it

588
00:18:56,289 --> 00:18:59,500
was leaving a little bit of an oil on

589
00:18:57,789 --> 00:19:01,299
the plants which was actually the main

590
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,769
ingredient that was stopping the PM I

591
00:19:01,299 --> 00:19:04,450
just didn't want to put this oil all

592
00:19:02,769 --> 00:19:07,029
over his buds so I didn't like spraying

593
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:09,670
it I researched another product and I

594
00:19:07,029 --> 00:19:12,779
was recommended big-time exterminator

595
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:15,160
big-time exterminator is 90 or is mostly

596
00:19:12,779 --> 00:19:16,089
citric acid or citric oil I don't

597
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:19,060
remember which one it is I think a

598
00:19:16,089 --> 00:19:21,129
citric acid and it works very well and

599
00:19:19,059 --> 00:19:23,139
keeping insects away it makes the plants

600
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:24,660
look really good and it also took the

601
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:26,800
powdery mildew off of the plants

602
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:28,509
unfortunately this product only worked

603
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:29,740
to keep the powdery mildew at bay for

604
00:19:28,509 --> 00:19:31,269
about three to five days at a time

605
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:33,759
before we would start seeing little

606
00:19:31,269 --> 00:19:35,889
speckles pop up it was getting closer to

607
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:38,410
harvest and I wanted to try something a

608
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:40,330
little bit more extreme we were ready to

609
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:43,090
go extreme we did not want to use Eagle

610
00:19:40,329 --> 00:19:45,048
20 I am trying to only use products that

611
00:19:43,089 --> 00:19:46,819
are allowed by the meed in my

612
00:19:45,048 --> 00:19:48,859
will grow and in my caregiver grows and

613
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:50,689
in my consultant grows just because it's

614
00:19:48,859 --> 00:19:52,508
easier to have one playing field so we

615
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:56,389
will not use Eagle 20 in this garden

616
00:19:52,509 --> 00:19:58,639
what I did use was I got 30% hydrogen

617
00:19:56,388 --> 00:20:01,278
peroxide and I filled up a four gallon

618
00:19:58,638 --> 00:20:03,408
pump sprayer and I put twenty

619
00:20:01,278 --> 00:20:05,929
milliliters per gallon of 30 percent

620
00:20:03,409 --> 00:20:08,629
hydrogen peroxide in this water and I

621
00:20:05,929 --> 00:20:09,830
adjusted the pH and I soaked all of the

622
00:20:08,628 --> 00:20:12,949
plants with this hydrogen peroxide

623
00:20:09,829 --> 00:20:14,918
solution and it took off most of the

624
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:16,788
powdery mildew and it did not come back

625
00:20:14,919 --> 00:20:18,739
unfortunately there was one plant in the

626
00:20:16,788 --> 00:20:20,538
back corner where the powdery mildew had

627
00:20:18,739 --> 00:20:21,919
kind of taken over and I didn't see it

628
00:20:20,538 --> 00:20:24,019
was so bad back there I didn't spray

629
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:26,809
enough it did not take off the powdery

630
00:20:24,019 --> 00:20:28,700
mildew on one plant so my friend

631
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:30,648
harvested most of his plants didn't show

632
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:33,048
signs of powdery mildew this one plant

633
00:20:30,648 --> 00:20:34,668
that did have powdery mildew I found a

634
00:20:33,048 --> 00:20:36,230
solution online my friend Jorge

635
00:20:34,669 --> 00:20:39,109
Cervantes taught us about this

636
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:40,999
I took a five-gallon bucket and I put 50

637
00:20:39,108 --> 00:20:43,189
milliliters of the 30 percent hydrogen

638
00:20:40,999 --> 00:20:44,720
peroxide in the bucket you guys whenever

639
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:45,919
you're mad let me let me back up a

640
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,649
little bit whenever you were messing

641
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:50,749
with this hydrogen peroxide be sure to

642
00:20:48,648 --> 00:20:51,979
wear rubber gloves you need some latex

643
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:53,710
gloves you don't want to get this stuff

644
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:55,730
on your fingers it'll burn your fingers

645
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:57,259
depending on what kind of skin you've

646
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:59,749
got it could mess up your fingers I'm a

647
00:20:57,259 --> 00:21:01,808
white guy I dribbled some on my fingers

648
00:20:59,749 --> 00:21:04,788
it made my fingers look bleached white I

649
00:21:01,808 --> 00:21:05,989
imagine if you don't have working hands

650
00:21:04,788 --> 00:21:07,940
if you've got some softer more gentle

651
00:21:05,989 --> 00:21:09,950
hands it probably could burn your skin

652
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:11,600
pretty well so make sure you wear gloves

653
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:14,419
when you're using the hydrogen peroxide

654
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:16,548
so mixer 50 mils of hydrogen peroxide

655
00:21:14,419 --> 00:21:19,038
into five a five gallon bucket of water

656
00:21:16,548 --> 00:21:21,079
and you guys this may sound crazy but I

657
00:21:19,038 --> 00:21:22,999
chopped the buds off of this plant and I

658
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:25,099
was dunking them directly into the water

659
00:21:22,999 --> 00:21:26,929
and swishing them around for about five

660
00:21:25,099 --> 00:21:28,819
to seven seconds just swishing it under

661
00:21:26,929 --> 00:21:30,889
the water with the peroxide in there let

662
00:21:28,819 --> 00:21:32,720
me back up I would cut off most of the

663
00:21:30,888 --> 00:21:34,519
leaf you guys most of the larger leaf

664
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,868
I'd give it a little pre trim and then I

665
00:21:34,519 --> 00:21:37,460
would dunk the bud in to the hydrogen

666
00:21:35,868 --> 00:21:40,099
peroxide and then I was hanging it on a

667
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:42,288
line with a flat fan an oscillating fan

668
00:21:40,099 --> 00:21:44,388
blowing near it constantly to dry these

669
00:21:42,288 --> 00:21:45,829
buds out as quickly not dry them but to

670
00:21:44,388 --> 00:21:46,339
get them water out of them as quickly as

671
00:21:45,829 --> 00:21:47,898
possible

672
00:21:46,339 --> 00:21:49,970
I left the fan on there for two to three

673
00:21:47,898 --> 00:21:51,349
hours and then toward the end of the day

674
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:53,240
I just turned the fan to where it wasn't

675
00:21:51,349 --> 00:21:54,259
blowing directly on them and I gave all

676
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:56,480
the buds a squeeze

677
00:21:54,259 --> 00:21:58,308
I cannot tell the difference between the

678
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,799
buds that I dunked in their solution and

679
00:21:58,308 --> 00:22:00,869
the buds

680
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:03,569
that were not dumped the best part is

681
00:22:00,869 --> 00:22:06,119
the buds I dunked shows zero signs of

682
00:22:03,569 --> 00:22:07,409
powdery mildew I don't know if this is

683
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:09,059
something you want to try at home this

684
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:11,850
is not something I would do in my garden

685
00:22:09,059 --> 00:22:13,319
but I saw it work you guys and when I

686
00:22:11,849 --> 00:22:14,429
smoke this product it's not ready to

687
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:17,460
smoke yet it'll be ready in a couple

688
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:19,830
days I am 90% sure that I'm not going to

689
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:22,620
notice any of the peroxide solution in

690
00:22:19,829 --> 00:22:24,720
these flowers so may sound completely

691
00:22:22,619 --> 00:22:25,919
crazy but if you've got a plant that's

692
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,509
got to be harvested and it's got a

693
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:29,580
little bit of powdery mildew on it the

694
00:22:27,509 --> 00:22:31,589
best solution is to get a five-gallon

695
00:22:29,579 --> 00:22:33,179
bucket some water and a little bit of

696
00:22:31,589 --> 00:22:34,859
hydrogen peroxide and go ahead and dunk

697
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:36,480
those buds in there believe I'm in there

698
00:22:34,859 --> 00:22:38,909
for five or six seconds pull them out

699
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,410
hang them up put a fan on them and try

700
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:42,600
to start getting them dry safely and

701
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:44,009
then from once they get dried out from

702
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:45,539
that water you just put in there you're

703
00:22:44,009 --> 00:22:47,309
just drying them just like normally you

704
00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:48,960
would dry and cure them just like any

705
00:22:47,309 --> 00:22:51,000
other flowers that you've cut down so I

706
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,049
hope that helps save your crop the most

707
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,339
important part you guys if you're

708
00:22:52,049 --> 00:22:54,779
getting powdery mildew you need to

709
00:22:53,339 --> 00:22:56,609
correct the issue in your grow room

710
00:22:54,779 --> 00:22:58,410
something is causing that powdery mildew

711
00:22:56,609 --> 00:23:00,659
to happen you are not getting enough

712
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:02,910
airflow in there I highly recommend

713
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:04,350
heavily defoliation your plants take off

714
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:06,330
all the extra leaf that will prevent

715
00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:08,459
p.m. there will be less surface area for

716
00:23:06,329 --> 00:23:10,409
the PM to build up on if you've got two

717
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:12,360
leaves that are on top of each other one

718
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:13,890
leaf lays on top of another and you get

719
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:15,899
that little water layer underneath there

720
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:17,970
that will eventually turn into powdery

721
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:19,980
mildew your plants are sweating on top

722
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:21,779
of each other and that sweaty space is

723
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:24,089
the perfect environment to create some

724
00:23:21,779 --> 00:23:25,799
p.m. also another thing that we are

725
00:23:24,089 --> 00:23:27,149
experimenting with I need to get with my

726
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:29,159
friend that's got this product but he

727
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:31,530
recently bought the clean light with the

728
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:33,930
clean line is it is a UV light that is

729
00:23:31,529 --> 00:23:35,220
designed for the strawberry industry and

730
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:37,259
the pumpkin industry because

731
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:39,900
strawberries and pumpkins apparently get

732
00:23:37,259 --> 00:23:41,309
powdery mildew very heavily so they take

733
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:42,810
this light and they hold it three to

734
00:23:41,309 --> 00:23:44,549
four inches above the plants and they

735
00:23:42,809 --> 00:23:47,039
just move this ultraviolet light around

736
00:23:44,549 --> 00:23:49,049
and this light supposedly kills powdery

737
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:50,490
mildew my friend just got it he's only

738
00:23:49,049 --> 00:23:52,049
used it a few times they say it takes

739
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:54,390
about a week of constant use of

740
00:23:52,049 --> 00:23:55,919
consistent use to get rid of the PM but

741
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:57,600
I will check with him in a few days and

742
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:59,910
we will see if this has cured his

743
00:23:57,599 --> 00:24:02,490
powdery mildew problem hey guys since

744
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:05,670
I'm talking about p.m. I have a theory

745
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:08,190
I feel like CBD rich plants seem to be

746
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:09,480
more susceptible to powdery mildew

747
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:12,058
I think there's something in the THC

748
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:13,679
that gives it resistance to p.m. and I

749
00:24:12,058 --> 00:24:15,778
do plan on talking to Fox a little bit

750
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:17,820
more about this so the next time I have

751
00:24:15,778 --> 00:24:20,128

752
