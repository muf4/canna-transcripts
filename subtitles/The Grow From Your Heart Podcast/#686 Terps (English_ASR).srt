66
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:36,000
is if you are sending seeds to somebody

67
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:37,919
anywhere if they are going in the mail

68
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,680
and they're traveling in the mail please

69
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:41,759
put those seeds in some sort of

70
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,840
protective container you would not

71
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:47,039
believe how many people allegedly

72
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,519
possibly uh hypothetically maybe send me

73
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:52,479
seeds to test or just as samples or just

74
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:54,560
as gifts and 7 out of 10 times they put

75
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:56,719
those seeds in just some shitty baggy

76
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,959
some lackluster packaging when they get

77
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:00,639
here they're crushed a lot of the mail

78
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,479
we get goes through

79
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:04,318
rollers i don't know exactly the process

80
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:05,840
at the post office i haven't gone back

81
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:07,119
there and had a tour but i've seen

82
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,959
videos i know a little bit of how it

83
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,959
works a lot of the packages go through

84
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,719
two rollers they just get moved down by

85
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,479
little rollers it looks like two rolling

86
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:16,158
pins when your seeds go through those

87
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:18,079
they get flattened and squished so if

88
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:19,598
you're going to send anybody seeds

89
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,840
please put them in some sort of

90
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:23,039
protective container little containers

91
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,039
are very affordable if you're going to

92
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:26,959
send a lot of seeds just order a couple

93
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:28,400
of packages they're not that expensive

94
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,439
or make something if you don't want to

95
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,360
make a package use a priority mailbox

96
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:34,400
they're boxes they won't get crushed

97
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,560
please

98
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,158
let's protect these seeds i love getting

99
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,318
gifts but it's really heartbreaking to

100
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:42,560
open up my gift and it's just a baggie

101
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:44,158
of seed dust with a label on it it says

102
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,400
hey these would would have been amazing

103
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:48,239
[ __ ] seeds it's this cross to this

104
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,840
which is very rare nobody else has it

105
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,680
here's all of the seeds i made you can

106
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,598
have them and guess what they're all

107
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,519
crushed they're all dust that's

108
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:57,598
heartbreaking so uh you wouldn't believe

109
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,680
how many times i've opened up packages

110
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:01,438
and found crushed seeds any seed that i

111
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,438
send out any seed that allegedly comes

112
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:05,438
from me or gets shipped in any way is

113
00:04:03,438 --> 00:04:07,359
put into a protective container it

114
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:08,878
doesn't cost that much uh just a little

115
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,239
bit of thought it shows that you care it

116
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:12,239
shows that you're thinking about the

117
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,158
person you're either selling sharing

118
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,599
giving to just think about that think

119
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:17,918
about the seeds we put a lot of time

120
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:20,159
effort and energy money thought into

121
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:22,000
this let's just protect the product it

122
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,080
doesn't take that much all right we will

123
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,199
quit rambling about protecting the seeds

124
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:26,639
i just think it's really important

125
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,560
especially as a seed vendor a seed

126
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,720
retailer i get a lot of seeds that are

127
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,478
poorly packaged let's package them up

128
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,960
all right let's jump into this email

129
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:36,399
this one came from our friend it doesn't

130
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:38,799
have a name on it if you wanted your

131
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:40,079

135
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:48,638
to jeff i enjoy your podcast and you're

136
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:50,719
growing oh and growing your wares i

137
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,560
appreciate that thank you it says i was

138
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,280
wondering if you could consider a

139
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,600
podcast about terpenes and the effects

140
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:59,839
that the presence absence or mixtures of

141
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,080
the various terpenes in a plant are

142
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:03,839
known to have that is a very uh good

143
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:06,879
question a very good topic we're gonna

144
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:08,959
jump into that it says most strains seem

145
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:11,600
to have a number of terps yes there's a

146
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:14,319
combination in most strains but it's

147
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,639
pretty clear that the high limonene and

148
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:18,879
a product gives me a bit of an edgy

149
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,720
heart racy effect as lemon sunrise

150
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:22,639
demonstrates yes that is

151
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,639
that limonene buzz is what i really

152
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,918
enjoy i've got a traumatic brain injury

153
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,280
so i'm not sure how much i've talked

154
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:28,719
about this on the show i'm not sure how

155
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:31,839
many episodes you have listened to so

156
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,840
i'll give you a brief update in 2015 i

157
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:36,159
suffered a traumatic brain injury i hit

158
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:38,000
my head not a big deal i hit my head one

159
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,840
time i was knocked unconscious then

160
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,759
while i was out i fell down the stairs

161
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:43,679
on my way down the stairs i smacked the

162
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:46,160
back of my head on the stairs several

163
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,918
times i woke up things were really not

164
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,919
good for my brain and for my body my

165
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:51,839
brain and body were not sending the

166
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:53,439
right signals i would forget that i was

167
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:54,879
hungry i would go two days without

168
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:56,240
eating and then my friends would hear my

169
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:57,918
stomach grumble and they'd say hey bro

170
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,519
are you hungry and i'd say i don't know

171
00:05:57,918 --> 00:06:01,519
maybe and they'd give me food and i

172
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:03,519
would eat like a [ __ ] savage like i'd

173
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:04,799
been a hostage for a week so i didn't i

174
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:06,079
wasn't getting the right signals i

175
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,120
didn't know that i was hot and cold the

176
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:09,120
right way

177
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,360
uh i would get really thirsty and not

178
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,879
realize it my lips and teeth and tongue

179
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,000
would be all stuck together and my

180
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:15,439
friends would be like really look like

181
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,478
fire marshall bill over there drink some

182
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:18,079
water and be like oh i didn't even

183
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:20,318
realize i was thirsty

184
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:22,478
i was having major problems with my

185
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,639
traumatic brain injury as i started to

186
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:26,879
heal and come back around i noticed that

187
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:29,038
i had sort of a a skip if you're from

188
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:31,279
the 90s you remember we used to have cds

189
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:33,599
we used to listen to our music on cds

190
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:35,679
sometimes those cds would get a skip or

191
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,039
a scratch on them and you would play it

192
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,120
and it would just have a little skip or

193
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:40,959
a little scratch in the same spot every

194
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,959
time so you'd be listening to a song and

195
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:44,719
it would be boom chick boom chick skip

196
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:46,399
boom chick boom jin just go right back

197
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,840
to the song you would almost remember

198
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:49,679
that there's a skip in that one part of

199
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:51,279
the song on your cd it'll just be

200
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,280
embedded in your memory as part of the

201
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:55,359
song well sometimes i experience that

202
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:56,879
type of a skip in my brain i'll feel

203
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,639
like that there's just something skip

204
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:00,000
something skip something is skipping in

205
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,519
my brain and you got to kind of like

206
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,879
give it a fonzy you just gotta nudge it

207
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:04,318
and then it'll jump right back in and

208
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:08,159
get going again

209
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:10,240
i've noticed that high limonene flowers

210
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,160
and concentrates will kind of help with

211
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,000
that skip i feel like it cleans off the

212
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,000
scratch on my record or my cd or it

213
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,839
takes off whatever was in the way and it

214
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,160
makes me flow a little bit better it

215
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:23,198
takes out the ticks and the skips so i

216
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:25,759
absolutely understand that limonene uh

217
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,199
can be very beneficial medicinally to a

218
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,598
lot of people it will give you that

219
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:32,080
panicky racy sort of a buzz

220
00:07:29,598 --> 00:07:34,959
i enjoy that panicky racy sort of a buzz

221
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:37,120
it kind of fixes me and then also i get

222
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:38,799
high from it and it makes me forget that

223
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,879
i've got a brain injury so that's how

224
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,038
limonene gets to me it's going to get to

225
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:45,199
people everybody is going to be affected

226
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:47,199
differently by terpenes that's something

227
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,360
that is later in my notes but let me let

228
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,360
me jump to that part now terpenes are

229
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,598
going to affect people differently just

230
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,680
like any other medicine does just like

231
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:57,279
brain chemistry and body chemistry i

232
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,759
know some people that can drink four

233
00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:02,079
cups of coffee and act normal if i drink

234
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,598
one cup of coffee i act like beavis and

235
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:05,120
i spin around for about 30 minutes and

236
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:07,120
then i take a big poop and a nap and i

237
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,720
got to sleep after that it's just body

238
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,399
chemistry brain chemistry the way that

239
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,240
things affect us so

240
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:14,318
my experience with terpenes may be

241
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,879
different than a lot of other people's

242
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,879
experience with terpenes it goes on to

243
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:21,120
say uh other than the lie mean it says

244
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:23,439
and any significant amount of mercene

245
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,720
will soon render me unconscious yes that

246
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:26,719
is very common there are a couple of

247
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,879
terps that send you up and also there

248
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:32,479
are a few terps that will send you down

249
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:34,000
and mellow you out in my opinion in my

250
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,599
experience let me make a disclaimer here

251
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,200
is something that i wanted to uh make

252
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:40,479
sure to include in this

253
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,320
i am not qualified to give a scientific

254
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,959
talk about terpenes i don't want to fake

255
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,640
it i don't want to [ __ ] you i am not

256
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:49,359
qualified i don't know about the

257
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:50,319
scientific part of terps what i do know

258
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,879
is how

259
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:55,600
aromas and flavors and cannabis benefit

260
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:59,360
me and how i select my cannabis and my

261
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:01,278
concentrates by aroma because i know

262
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,800
that my nose knows and we're going to

263
00:09:01,278 --> 00:09:05,039
talk about that but i want to make it

264
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:08,000
clear that i don't have any sort of

265
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:10,159
science education any degree any of that

266
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,559
everything i'm talking about is from my

267
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:14,319
personal experience i can't tell you the

268
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:16,239
compounds of terpenes i can't tell you

269
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,959
what makes a terpene i don't know that

270
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,000
part i'm going to be completely honest

271
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,759
with you that i don't have that

272
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,399
education i'm going to talk about what i

273
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:25,439
do know and explain it the way that i do

274
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,958
know it

275
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,560
so here's something i

276
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:32,879
i think is my my experience when i smoke

277
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:33,679
i think that the cannabinoid

278
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:35,519
is

279
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:38,079
uh let's say it's a firework okay let's

280
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:42,000
say that smoking is fireworks and when i

281
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:44,240
take a dab the thc is how high i'm going

282
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,480
to shoot into the sky right i take a dab

283
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,919
and if there's low amounts of thc i'm

284
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,920
only going to lift off so high if

285
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:52,399
there's high amounts of thc we're going

286
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:55,120
real high so that's kind of my my fuel

287
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:58,080
my rocket power in my dab or in my smoke

288
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,839
is the cannabinoid the thc now i think

289
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:03,200
that the terpenes

290
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:04,800
are the colors of my fireworks are my

291
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,320
fireworks going to be green are they

292
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:10,399
going to be purple are they going to be

293
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:12,480
red those colors are the effects in my

294
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,799
opinion do i get the munchies do i get

295
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,039
the giggles do i get paranoid do i get

296
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:19,359
pain relief do i get a panic attack

297
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:22,319
those are the that's what the terpenes

298
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:25,200
brings to my smoke to my concentrate so

299
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,200
the thc that shoots me up the terpenes

300
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,879
are the type of buzz that i get

301
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,040
sometimes you get the giggles right

302
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:33,039
sometimes you get paranoid as [ __ ] i

303
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:35,039
think that's all about the terpenes i

304
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:37,278
think that we think too much about

305
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:39,679
indica and sativa and we don't focus

306
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:41,278
enough on the terpenes now i know that i

307
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:42,879
just basically implied that we should

308
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:45,278
focus more on terpenes when we are

309
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:47,519
selecting our products but at the same

310
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:49,360
time i don't know a lot about terpenes i

311
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,360
haven't bothered to learn what every

312
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,159
terpene smells like what the effects and

313
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,399
qualities of every terpene are because

314
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:59,199
when i'm talking to people most of the

315
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:01,440
people i talk to don't speak terpenes

316
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,519
they speak normal languages they don't i

317
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,120
can't say hey this product really smells

318
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,639
like linalool or this product really

319
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,560
smells like mercy and most people are

320
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:09,679
going to have to google that and i'm not

321
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:10,799
doing them any good they're going to

322
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:12,159
then they're going to go to google and

323
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:14,159
they're going to say oh lindal that

324
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:15,759
probably smells like lavender citrus and

325
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:17,759
laurel i should have just gotten right

326
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:19,519
to the point and said this herb smells

327
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:21,838
like lavender and citrus that would have

328
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:24,320
been more beneficial so i love terps and

329
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:26,399
i love talking about terps but i often

330
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,720
times skip all of that technical stuff

331
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,958
because how many people out there want

332
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,800
to hear oh it smells like linalool and

333
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:34,479
it smells like this percent of linoleum

334
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:36,319
this much mercy and they want me to say

335
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,399
it smells like chocolate or it smells

336
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,720
like gas everybody out there knows what

337
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,399
chocolate and gas smells like you get

338
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,920
memories in your mouth and in your brain

339
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,360
and in your nose when i say chocolate

340
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:46,559
you go um chocolate you could smell

341
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,399
different types of chocolate and

342
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:50,719
different textures of chocolate and that

343
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,000
gives me options if i say linalool you

344
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,560
gotta google it and figure out what that

345
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,159
even is and honestly

346
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:57,838
i've never had a machine come back and

347
00:11:56,159 --> 00:11:59,919
say hey can i get more of that high

348
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,959
linoleum product i've had people say hey

349
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:02,719
do you have any more of that herb that

350
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:04,239
smelled like cherries and feet so i

351
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,879
think it's much more

352
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:09,039
just practical for me to talk in terms

353
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:10,720
of flavors and aromas that are familiar

354
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:13,679
instead of being technical about

355
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,600
linoleul corophiline and words like that

356
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:17,679
it does sound cool it makes me look pro

357
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,839
but i lose a lot of people all of those

358
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:23,199
fancy terpene descriptions are great for

359
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:25,839
the medical industry but my nose doesn't

360
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,759
care what linoleum mercine any of that

361
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:30,000
stuff is my nose goes

362
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:31,919
oh that smells good i want to smoke that

363
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,399
and i think that there's something in us

364
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:36,719
just primally that knows what our body

365
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,879
needs that's why that's why poop stinks

366
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,720
that's why oranges smell good you're not

367
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:43,120
supposed to eat poop so nature whatever

368
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,600
you believe in nature god ja

369
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,600
sun uh whatever you want to talk about

370
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,040
whatever you believe in made poop stink

371
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,560
so that we don't eat it that is waste

372
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:52,958
you're not supposed to put that in you

373
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:54,799
smell it from far away the less healthy

374
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:56,319
it is the worse it stinks you go god

375
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:57,919
that [ __ ] smells so bad it could smell

376
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,360
from 10 feet away i don't even want to

377
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:00,799
go over there you're not going to eat it

378
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,800
you're not going to consume it when you

379
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:04,399
walk through an orange grove you go oh

380
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:05,838
unless you're allergic to oranges i do

381
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:08,000
know people that are deathly allergic to

382
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:09,440
oranges i apologize for this but if

383
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,320
you're into origins you walk through the

384
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,600
orange grove you go that smells so good

385
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,200
and you just want to eat them because

386
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,200
oranges are good for you they got some

387
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,440
sugar in there they taste good they got

388
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,959
vitamin c in there oranges are

389
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,880
beneficial they give you some vitamins

390
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:24,638
so they smell good your body wants it

391
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:26,639
it's why when you smell good food your

392
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,639
mouth starts watering you know it's why

393
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,879
when you smell poop you want to go away

394
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:33,039
i think that the terps and cannabis do

395
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:35,519
the same thing to us when the bud tender

396
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:37,439
opens a jar your brain doesn't go ooh

397
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,839
linoleum mercy and corrophylene your

398
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,040
brain doesn't do that and some of you do

399
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,480
some of you nerds out there and i love

400
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:44,399
you nerds for it no offense there's

401
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,000
always uh categories of nerds in the

402
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,879
weed industry but most people are gonna

403
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,600
go

404
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:51,198
i don't like that oh i really like that

405
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,040
that's okay that's how your brain is

406
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:55,278
gonna respond and then you're gonna go

407
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:57,360
berries i want some of that that's most

408
00:13:55,278 --> 00:13:58,879
likely the one that is going to give you

409
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,959
the effects that you need the one that

410
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:02,559
you're going to enjoy the most so i've

411
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:05,278
said it before i've actually got a full

412
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:07,439
podcast that is titled follow your nose

413
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:09,838
because i love the machines i love the

414
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,839
readouts i love the graphs but your nose

415
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,040
knows what you need your nose is the

416
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:14,959
boss

417
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:16,958
my nose and your nose are different

418
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:18,799
because your body chemistry my body

419
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:20,078
chemistry are different our needs might

420
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:22,479
be different

421
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:24,559
our recreational and medical needs for

422
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,000
cannabis might be different i like stuff

423
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:28,239
like i said earlier

424
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,600
i like to smoke myself into a panic

425
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,000
attack i have a lot of friends that like

426
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,000
to smoke themselves into a coma it's all

427
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,360
about what you're desiring for the buzz

428
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,919
there is more to this message i got

429
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,120
quite rambly uh let me catch up on this

430
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:41,278
it says i'm not asking for a

431
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,198
biochemistry lesson or anything just

432
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:44,958
your own observations that's great

433
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:46,559
because honestly like i said before i

434
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:48,638
don't have the qualifications to give

435
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:51,518
you the actual chemistry i just know

436
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:53,680
through uh experience that uh the

437
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:56,320
cannabinoids seem to make me go up and

438
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:58,319
the terpenes seem to dictate the color

439
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,639
and direction of my buzz that is the

440
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,480
best way i can describe that i do have a

441
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,879
few more notes here i want to make sure

442
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,560
that i cover uh follow your nose is one

443
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:08,240
of the most important parts all right

444
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:10,000
