13
00:00:24,589 --> 00:00:30,259
terrible sounding voice our friend Brett

14
00:00:27,589 --> 00:00:31,849
also known as Mary's motivation I had a

15
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:34,039
going-away party and I went to that

16
00:00:31,849 --> 00:00:37,009
going-away party and I smoked way too

17
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:38,899
much flour and way too much concentrate

18
00:00:37,009 --> 00:00:40,009
and my voice sounds like crap I got a

19
00:00:38,899 --> 00:00:41,660
little bit of a chest cold

20
00:00:40,009 --> 00:00:43,219
I got a throat thing going on I got a

21
00:00:41,659 --> 00:00:45,468
sinus thing happening and before we get

22
00:00:43,219 --> 00:00:46,789
too far I just want to apologize and I

23
00:00:45,469 --> 00:00:49,969
want to thank you for listening to this

24
00:00:46,789 --> 00:00:51,140
episode while I sound like poop all

25
00:00:49,969 --> 00:00:52,820
right I'd like to start the episode off

26
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:55,280
by letting you know what I'm smoking on

27
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:57,799
today I'm taking little baby dabs of

28
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,570
gorilla glue for ambrosia and also I've

29
00:00:57,799 --> 00:01:02,089
got some of the New York City Beisel

30
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:04,640
ambrosia batter both from apothecary

31
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:06,079
it's been a nice mix fiscal and light

32
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,820
today just trying to stay lightly

33
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:09,679
medicated and not mess up my lungs and

34
00:01:07,819 --> 00:01:12,829
throat again I'm on the path to recovery

35
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,868
and I want to keep moving forward so a

36
00:01:12,829 --> 00:01:16,459
minute ago I mentioned that I went to my

37
00:01:14,868 --> 00:01:18,500
friend Brett also known as Mary's

38
00:01:16,459 --> 00:01:20,500
motivation I went to Brett's going away

39
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:22,400
party Brett is leaving the country

40
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,930
Brett's a little scared and nervous

41
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,630
about his trip but honestly I don't

42
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:28,490
think anybody deserves this more Brett

43
00:01:26,629 --> 00:01:29,868
needs to make this adventure happen I

44
00:01:28,489 --> 00:01:31,699
think it's going to be a great

45
00:01:29,868 --> 00:01:34,849
experience for him so I'm super proud

46
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:35,390
and super excited for him his party was

47
00:01:34,849 --> 00:01:38,269
awesome

48
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:40,009
at the party we were joined by of course

49
00:01:38,269 --> 00:01:42,769
the always awesome Brett was there

50
00:01:40,009 --> 00:01:46,069
dabbing granny and and Kevin showed up

51
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:47,929
also Lucy mama bear dabs is there always

52
00:01:46,069 --> 00:01:49,699
good to see Lucy I got to bump into my

53
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:51,890
friend twisty seeds who I don't see very

54
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:53,840
often I got to have a conversation a

55
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:55,879
long conversation with Chandler dabbing

56
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,270
that was pretty cool Earle tycoon was

57
00:01:55,879 --> 00:01:58,968
there

58
00:01:56,269 --> 00:02:01,459
the dude from hits on hand was there LJ

59
00:01:58,968 --> 00:02:02,989
fresh was there and several other new

60
00:02:01,459 --> 00:02:05,149
and old friends were there hanging out

61
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:06,859
it was a great party there were a couple

62
00:02:05,149 --> 00:02:09,530
of folks there who brought Koenig ours

63
00:02:06,859 --> 00:02:11,840
which are basically blunts rolled with

64
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:13,939
cannabis leaves as the wrapper that

65
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,390
really [ __ ] up my lungs you guys my

66
00:02:13,939 --> 00:02:16,909
lungs

67
00:02:14,389 --> 00:02:19,309
not like that at all they were delicious

68
00:02:16,909 --> 00:02:21,650
to smoke and we got really lit but that

69
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:23,750
is why I think I sound like crap today

70
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:25,939
so shout out to Bret for the great party

71
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:28,068
the party was a private party so not a

72
00:02:25,939 --> 00:02:30,289
lot of people were invited the event was

73
00:02:28,068 --> 00:02:32,119
at cultivated synergy I owe a huge shout

74
00:02:30,289 --> 00:02:33,769

78
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:42,319

30 people I was honored to be amongst

84
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:55,219
those 30 it was a great party you guys

85
00:02:53,419 --> 00:02:56,659
we smoked that place out for how few

86
00:02:55,219 --> 00:02:58,189
people there were in there there's a

87
00:02:56,659 --> 00:03:00,379
pretty big building and we smoked that

88
00:02:58,189 --> 00:03:02,509
[ __ ] out pretty good you can hear to my

89
00:03:00,379 --> 00:03:04,549
voice still alright well I've still got

90
00:03:02,509 --> 00:03:06,919
some good voice left let's do a quick

91
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:09,560
podcast about flushing your plants

92
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:12,319
before harvest before we talk about

93
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,580
flushing I should do a quick recap in

94
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:16,519
the last episode I talked about

95
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:18,890
determining ripeness Mike and I went

96
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:20,810
fairly fast and we got kinda rambly so I

97
00:03:18,889 --> 00:03:23,149
hope I made it clear that determining

98
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:25,099
ripeness is usually done by using some

99
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:28,700
sort of a loop so that you can see the

100
00:03:25,099 --> 00:03:31,250
trichomes I mentioned using a 60 or 100x

101
00:03:28,699 --> 00:03:33,530
loop one of our friends from Instagram

102
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:37,729
what's up dank Sinatra our friend dank

103
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:39,590
Sinatra i sheer photo and seeds sent me

104
00:03:37,729 --> 00:03:41,479
a message and he says now I can't see

105
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:44,390
try comes with my naked eye but I can

106
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:46,729
tell ripeness of a trichome with a 16x

107
00:03:44,389 --> 00:03:49,819
jeweler's loupe they said of course in

108
00:03:46,729 --> 00:03:52,399
my mind I'm in my mid 20s so my eyes may

109
00:03:49,819 --> 00:03:53,750
work a little better yes dude you are a

110
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,650
little bit younger than me you got those

111
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:59,539
fresh new eyes but he corrected me he

112
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:01,640
says he can see the trichomes with the

113
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:04,548
16x jeweler's loupe so you may not need

114
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:07,039
that bigger loop that 60 that 100 he

115
00:04:04,549 --> 00:04:09,860
says the 60 is working or the 16 is

116
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:12,769
working for him so I stand corrected you

117
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:15,049
may not need that big loop 16 may get

118
00:04:12,769 --> 00:04:16,759
you through also let's recap a little

119
00:04:15,049 --> 00:04:19,100
bit about what I said about harvest

120
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:21,349
times I said that if you have a plant

121
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:23,419
that is said to go 60 days let it go the

122
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:25,520
full 60 days and start flushing at day

123
00:04:23,418 --> 00:04:28,219
50 if you've got a plant that's supposed

124
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:30,769
to go 70 days let it go the full 7

125
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:33,830
days and start flushing around day 60

126
00:04:30,769 --> 00:04:35,659
now you may say Rasta Jeff I want to

127
00:04:33,829 --> 00:04:37,819
dial it in and cut these plants down at

128
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:39,560
the perfect ripeness yes you're going to

129
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:41,839
have to dial that in something I wanted

130
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:43,939
to stress is this is not your last grow

131
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:46,129
with this strain hopefully this is your

132
00:04:43,939 --> 00:04:48,620
first run with this cultivar with this

133
00:04:46,129 --> 00:04:50,029
cut so now you've got a new girlfriend

134
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:51,649
that you've got to learn a little bit

135
00:04:50,029 --> 00:04:53,359
you've got to take her out a couple of

136
00:04:51,649 --> 00:04:57,319
times you got to see if she wants to

137
00:04:53,360 --> 00:05:00,410
come down at day 60 day 63 maybe day 67

138
00:04:57,319 --> 00:05:02,420
maybe day 72 you've got to dial it in

139
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:04,040
exactly to the right day now you're

140
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:05,689
gonna see differences if you use

141
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:07,550
different nutrients you may get

142
00:05:05,689 --> 00:05:09,170
different ripening dates if you have a

143
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:11,090
little bit of temperature difference you

144
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:12,980
may get a different ripening day so

145
00:05:11,089 --> 00:05:15,259
you're gonna have to find the window and

146
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:17,030
dial that in hopefully this is not your

147
00:05:15,259 --> 00:05:19,250
last girl with this cut hopefully this

148
00:05:17,029 --> 00:05:21,649
is the first of many grows with a good

149
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:24,410
cut so if it's your first run with the

150
00:05:21,649 --> 00:05:26,449
60-day cut start flushing around day 50

151
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:28,760
if this is your first time with a cut

152
00:05:26,449 --> 00:05:31,129
that you think may go 70 days start

153
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:33,110
flushing it around day 60 now when you

154
00:05:31,129 --> 00:05:35,180
get to day 60 or day 70 on whichever

155
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:36,350
plant you're running you don't have to

156
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:38,509
cut it down just because you've been

157
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:40,490
flushing for ten days start paying more

158
00:05:38,509 --> 00:05:43,039
attention to the trichomes if they are

159
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:44,629
not amber don't cut it down keep

160
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:47,180
flushing for a few more days it's better

161
00:05:44,629 --> 00:05:48,439
to over flush then under flush the only

162
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,550
thing you're doing is not giving it

163
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:51,019
nutrients it may have gotten a little

164
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:53,329
bigger it may have gotten a little

165
00:05:51,019 --> 00:05:55,759
beefier but we're just trying to figure

166
00:05:53,329 --> 00:05:59,839
out the plant for the first time so that

167
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:01,668
is how to determine when to begin flush

168
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:03,439
if you don't know the cultivar that

169
00:06:01,668 --> 00:06:05,539
you're using maybe it's a brand new seed

170
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:06,800
maybe it's a new clone maybe you're just

171
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:09,350
new at growing and you don't know when

172
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,879
to cut it allowing the plant 60 to 70

173
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:12,979
days to grow and then giving yourself

174
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:15,409
extra time at the end is always your

175
00:06:12,978 --> 00:06:18,050
best bet with a new cut alright so I

176
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:19,700
feel like I have established how to tell

177
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:21,978
if the plant is ripe and ready to cut

178
00:06:19,699 --> 00:06:24,199
down and I feel like we have a good idea

179
00:06:21,978 --> 00:06:26,599
of when to start flushing let's actually

180
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:29,449
talk about flushing our cannabis plants

181
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:30,680
I think flushing is super simple and

182
00:06:29,449 --> 00:06:33,259
it's something people could easily

183
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,910
improve and they are really skipping

184
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:37,610
that step and I'm not sure why because

185
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:40,980
it's free it's a really easy step to

186
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:42,810
improve your cannabis and it is free

187
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:45,210
maybe people simply don't understand the

188
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:47,189
importance of flushing and why it's

189
00:06:45,209 --> 00:06:49,799
important so let me tell you quickly why

190
00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:52,980
flushing matters just imagine you've

191
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:55,650
been pouring salty nutrients into this

192
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:57,720
plant for nine weeks of flower plus

193
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:59,009
another three or four weeks of veg

194
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,700
you've just been filling it up with

195
00:06:59,009 --> 00:07:01,620
nutrients

196
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:03,539
you've been pouring whatever nutrient

197
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:04,949
brand you're using even pouring nitrogen

198
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:06,600
you've been pouring phosphorus you've

199
00:07:04,949 --> 00:07:08,759
been pouring potassium and you've been

200
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:11,100
pouring carbohydrates into these plants

201
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:12,930
for the past twelve weeks now all of

202
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:15,210
that stuff is built up inside of that

203
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:16,620
plant the plant is not using all of it

204
00:07:15,209 --> 00:07:18,569
it's letting some of it go it's turning

205
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:20,340
some of it into a gas and transpiring

206
00:07:18,569 --> 00:07:21,029
some of it out but some of it is still

207
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:23,879
in the plant

208
00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:26,189
if those nutrients are left in the plant

209
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:28,560
when we harvest try and cure that plant

210
00:07:26,189 --> 00:07:31,920
we're going to taste it the plants are

211
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,930
going to taste like crap if you feed too

212
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:35,850
much cal-mag too late in flower you're

213
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:37,740
going to taste it if you feed your

214
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:39,600
plants too much potassium silicon light

215
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:41,340
and flower you're going to taste it also

216
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,080
the plants are not going to burn

217
00:07:41,339 --> 00:07:44,939
properly when you dry and cure these

218
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:46,409
buds they're not gonna smoke you're

219
00:07:44,939 --> 00:07:47,969
gonna grind it up in a grinder you're

220
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:49,710
gonna roll a joint and it's just gonna

221
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:51,900
burn black and make a funky weird

222
00:07:49,709 --> 00:07:54,449
charcoal that's because they're leftover

223
00:07:51,899 --> 00:07:56,310
nutrients that you did not flush out we

224
00:07:54,449 --> 00:07:58,649
can get that stuff out of there by

225
00:07:56,310 --> 00:08:01,439
properly flushing the plants you were

226
00:07:58,649 --> 00:08:03,239
mostly flushing the soil you want to

227
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:05,430
clean out the soil so there's nothing

228
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:08,220
left in your media but whether it's soil

229
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:10,470
soilless mix if you got peat whatever

230
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:12,420
you're working in you're gonna want to

231
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:14,910
flush that if it's rock wool if it's

232
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:16,259
cocoa you need to clean it out each

233
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:18,390
thing is going to take a different

234
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:19,949
amount of time to clean out but you want

235
00:08:18,389 --> 00:08:22,289
to clean that out so the roots don't

236
00:08:19,949 --> 00:08:24,089
have anything to eat then the plant will

237
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:26,400
start starving itself and it will start

238
00:08:24,089 --> 00:08:29,129
showing as harvest fall colors and it

239
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:31,529
will taste proper when you dry it cure

240
00:08:29,129 --> 00:08:32,668
it and smoke it so that's why flushing

241
00:08:31,529 --> 00:08:34,439
is important you want to get all those

242
00:08:32,668 --> 00:08:36,960
excess nutrients out of there all those

243
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:39,090
excess salts when you roll a joint and

244
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,979
smoke it you don't want it to turn into

245
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:44,070
a little briquette you want it to turn

246
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:47,220
into a nice white fluffy ash and just

247
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:49,890
flake away so that comes from a properly

248
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:51,899
flushed plant then that also comes from

249
00:08:49,889 --> 00:08:53,259
a properly dried cure to trim to plant

250
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:55,019
but that comes and the

251
00:08:53,259 --> 00:08:57,460
future today we're focusing on flushing

252
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:58,870
so that's why flushing is important you

253
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:00,879
guys you want your herb to taste good

254
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:04,120
you want it to burn well and you wanted

255
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:07,299
to leave a nice white clean soft - with

256
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:09,909
no weird chunks so let's actually talk

257
00:09:07,299 --> 00:09:12,519
about flushing the plants flushing the

258
00:09:09,909 --> 00:09:14,469
plants is really easy about 10 to 14

259
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:16,689
days before you plan on harvesting the

260
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:18,100
plants prepare the amount of water that

261
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:20,410
you would normally water the garden with

262
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:21,850
if you've got 1,000 watt light maybe

263
00:09:20,409 --> 00:09:23,559
you've got a five-gallon bucket full of

264
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:25,659
water right so get that amount of water

265
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:27,699
ready when you would normally put

266
00:09:25,659 --> 00:09:30,339
nutrients into the water don't do that

267
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:32,410
just don't put nutrients in there maybe

268
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:34,240
if you're gonna add anything put some

269
00:09:32,409 --> 00:09:36,759
enzymes in there if you're using an

270
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,620
enzyme that will help break down all the

271
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:40,569
the decaying roots and all the matter

272
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:42,279
inside of the root zone and it will

273
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:44,110
speed up the process of the flush it

274
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:46,389
will help speed everything up but

275
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:48,340
enzymes are pretty much the only thing I

276
00:09:46,389 --> 00:09:50,679
would put in there other than maybe a

277
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:53,050
little bit of shine maybe one to two

278
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:54,099
grams of shine from veg bloom but you

279
00:09:53,049 --> 00:09:55,569
really don't need it

280
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:57,639
mostly all you would need is some

281
00:09:55,570 --> 00:10:00,250
enzymes for the last couple of days if

282
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:03,009
you're gonna flush for 14 days maybe go

283
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:05,230
for like 4 to 7 days add 2 grams of

284
00:10:03,009 --> 00:10:06,789
shine and add some enzymes but then cut

285
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:08,800
out the shine and just keep the enzymes

286
00:10:06,789 --> 00:10:10,629
going until the end of the process so

287
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:13,089
the only thing you'd put in there are

288
00:10:10,629 --> 00:10:15,519
enzymes and possibly some shine but you

289
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:18,610
would be probably just fine with nothing

290
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:20,949
at all so clean water add the enzymes if

291
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:22,419
you're gonna do so for four to seven

292
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:25,810
days add the shine if you'd like to do

293
00:10:22,419 --> 00:10:28,750
so then adjust the pH to somewhere

294
00:10:25,809 --> 00:10:30,699
between 63 and 65 you'll be just fine 63

295
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:33,970
and 65 that's a good window to adjust it

296
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:35,860
to then simply water the plants with

297
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:38,110
that minimal solution all you've got to

298
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:40,149
do is pour that right into the plants

299
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:42,340
just like you normally do any water soak

300
00:10:40,149 --> 00:10:44,500
the plants and let it run through now

301
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:47,080
what you're doing pouring the enzymes in

302
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:49,269
there is going to help the natural

303
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:50,800
decaying process happen inside that root

304
00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:52,600
zone there's dead things in there the

305
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:54,099
roots that are dying are dying in there

306
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,110
the enzymes are gonna eat that and

307
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:58,090
they're gonna speed up that process also

308
00:10:56,110 --> 00:11:00,580
that shine is going to keep adding

309
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:01,960
density and trichomes and essential oils

310
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:03,940
to your plants if you choose to add the

311
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:05,650
shine you still need to flush for the

312
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:06,760
last week without the shine you guys so

313
00:11:05,649 --> 00:11:08,019
make sure you cut that out

314
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:09,730
you can leave the enzymes in there if

315
00:11:08,019 --> 00:11:11,889
you'd like to at the end but cut out

316
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:13,899
that shine for the last week now you're

317
00:11:11,889 --> 00:11:16,210
probably at day 50 right if we're gonna

318
00:11:13,899 --> 00:11:18,009
cut down at day 60 we're at day 50 we

319
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:19,750
just mixed up a bunch of water and we

320
00:11:18,009 --> 00:11:22,990
just soaked that root zone so now you've

321
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:25,000
got pH D water with enzymes and possibly

322
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:26,350
some shine running through there those

323
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,360
plants are gonna start looking for

324
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:29,440
phosphorous and potassium and molybdenum

325
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,539
and all the other things that they want

326
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,770
there are 16 minerals that the plants

327
00:11:31,539 --> 00:11:34,269
really want you guys start thinking

328
00:11:32,769 --> 00:11:35,439
about that and learn all 16 of them that

329
00:11:34,269 --> 00:11:37,240
will really help you think about what

330
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,860
you're feeding your plant maybe we'll

331
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:40,060
talk about that in the future but the

332
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:41,500
plants gonna start looking for that

333
00:11:40,059 --> 00:11:43,809
stuff and all it's gonna find our

334
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:45,340
enzymes and shine it's gonna be like

335
00:11:43,809 --> 00:11:47,289
well I've got essential oils I'm gonna

336
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:48,850
go beef up my trichomes and it's got

337
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:50,649
stuff to build trichomes but it doesn't

338
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:52,680
have the building blocks to grow more

339
00:11:50,649 --> 00:11:54,759
plant material it doesn't have all the

340
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:56,799
nutrition that it needs to keep building

341
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:58,840
bigger buds and fatter stems and going

342
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:01,059
so it's gonna start showing you its fall

343
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:02,950
colors it's gonna start turning into B's

344
00:12:01,059 --> 00:12:04,599
yellow golden colors you may get some

345
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:07,030
reds you may get some purples you'll get

346
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,680
some unique oranges I really like taking

347
00:12:07,029 --> 00:12:10,149
pictures of my plants right right at the

348
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:11,769
flush phase because they really start

349
00:12:10,149 --> 00:12:14,169
showing great colors the buds are nice

350
00:12:11,769 --> 00:12:15,850
and fat the trichomes are all greasy and

351
00:12:14,169 --> 00:12:18,309
shiny and then the leaves start getting

352
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:20,170
these cool golden tones to them but

353
00:12:18,309 --> 00:12:22,179
that's when you know that the flush is

354
00:12:20,169 --> 00:12:24,250
working there are no nutrients left in

355
00:12:22,179 --> 00:12:25,779
that soil for the plant to eat and it is

356
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:27,820
getting hungry which is a good thing

357
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:29,350
because now you know that bud is gonna

358
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:32,080
burn smoothly it's not gonna have

359
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:35,080
nitrogen phosphorus potassium believed

360
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:36,550
in them iron calcium magnesium it's not

361
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:38,170
gonna have all this other funky [ __ ] in

362
00:12:36,549 --> 00:12:40,779
it that we don't want to smoke it's just

363
00:12:38,169 --> 00:12:42,639
gonna be nice and clean it'll burn nice

364
00:12:40,779 --> 00:12:44,319
and smoothly and it will taste really

365
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:48,069
good so you're gonna start seeing these

366
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:51,460
fall colors come on that timing is going

367
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:53,290
to depend on your medium how much

368
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:55,660
nutrients you have been putting into the

369
00:12:53,289 --> 00:12:58,449
plant it's gonna be very strained

370
00:12:55,659 --> 00:13:00,279
specific and also temperatures are going

371
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:02,230
to have a huge effect on this if it's a

372
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:04,329
little cooler in the room your plants

373
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:05,560
are gonna turn a little more fall colors

374
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:07,180
if you have a lower nighttime

375
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:09,159
temperature you'll see a little more

376
00:13:07,179 --> 00:13:11,559
purple from the buds you'll get a little

377
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:14,529
more fall activity from the plants like

378
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:16,659
what happened in nature so you're gonna

379
00:13:14,529 --> 00:13:18,370
mix up the solution you're gonna pH it

380
00:13:16,659 --> 00:13:20,259
you're gonna water in the plants it's

381
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:22,710
gonna run out of the bottom then

382
00:13:20,259 --> 00:13:25,809
depending on your container size and the

383
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:28,600
vapor pressure deficit in the room you

384
00:13:25,809 --> 00:13:30,579
were going to have to water again repeat

385
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,769
the process you guys makes up your

386
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:35,560
container put the enzymes in there put

387
00:13:32,769 --> 00:13:37,870
the shine in there pH adjust it to six

388
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:39,459
point three to six point five and water

389
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:41,590
it right through the plants repeat this

390
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:44,110
process right up to a week before

391
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:46,360
harvest and then do the same thing but

392
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:49,300
simply take out the shine add the

393
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:52,480
enzymes adjust the pH and then feed it

394
00:13:49,299 --> 00:13:54,039
right through the plants now the enzymes

395
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,320
are totally not necessary

396
00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:58,269
the shine is totally not necessary you

397
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,310
can do all of this with plain water if

398
00:13:58,269 --> 00:14:02,529
you're adding the enzymes and shine you

399
00:14:00,309 --> 00:14:05,079
were going to have connoisseur quality

400
00:14:02,529 --> 00:14:07,389
cannabis that's what I would do I would

401
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:08,770
do the shine up to the last week then

402
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:10,419
after that I would just do the enzymes

403
00:14:08,769 --> 00:14:11,949
and then I'd probably do just two or

404
00:14:10,419 --> 00:14:14,169
three days of playing water just to give

405
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:16,930
him time to finish up there if I was

406
00:14:14,169 --> 00:14:18,159
going at 60 days I would end up going 63

407
00:14:16,929 --> 00:14:20,289
in that last three days would just be

408
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:23,049
playing water and my grow is what would

409
00:14:20,289 --> 00:14:25,449
happen there so just keep repeating the

410
00:14:23,049 --> 00:14:27,279
process you want to rinse these plants

411
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:29,410
out do you want to rinse the soil out as

412
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:31,659
many times as you can between the

413
00:14:29,409 --> 00:14:33,909
starter flush and harvest so if you can

414
00:14:31,659 --> 00:14:36,250
get it to dry up and re water it every

415
00:14:33,909 --> 00:14:38,199
other day that's great if it takes three

416
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:40,809
or four days that's fine you're still

417
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:42,340
going to get oh if you do it 12 days you

418
00:14:40,809 --> 00:14:44,349
get three waterings in there if you go

419
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:45,639
every four days but if you're taking

420
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:47,560
that much time to water that means

421
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:49,090
you've got a large container or that

422
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:50,799
much time between waterings means you've

423
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:52,509
got a large container which means you're

424
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:54,519
using quite a bit of water to flush that

425
00:14:52,509 --> 00:14:57,580
out which means you need to make sure to

426
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:59,230
get at least like 10 to 30% runoff water

427
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:01,480
so if you got like a 10 gallon pot

428
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:03,190
you're gonna want to get at least one to

429
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,570
2 gallons of runoff coming out of that

430
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:06,520
that's how you know you're flushing well

431
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:08,470
so get plenty of water coming out and

432
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:10,600
then flush the [ __ ] out of those plants

433
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:13,269
I do it as many times as you can but be

434
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:15,580
careful not to drown the plant don't try

435
00:15:13,269 --> 00:15:17,079
to sneak in another flush time just to

436
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:19,150
get more water in there because that may

437
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:20,530
do more harm than good that may you may

438
00:15:19,149 --> 00:15:22,149
kill the [ __ ] plant right there you

439
00:15:20,529 --> 00:15:23,709
may just drown it you may suffocate it

440
00:15:22,149 --> 00:15:26,049
that may be the end you may be cut down

441
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:27,970
early so don't ruin it right at the end

442
00:15:26,049 --> 00:15:29,589
be careful to stay on your normal

443
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:31,360
watering schedule just make sure you

444
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:33,550
soak the [ __ ] out of it let it dry out

445
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,000
water it again do that as many times as

446
00:15:33,549 --> 00:15:36,549
you can

447
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,500
in the last 10 to 14 days and if you

448
00:15:36,549 --> 00:15:40,389
want to add the enzymes do that you want

449
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:43,029
to use shine do that those are the only

450
00:15:40,389 --> 00:15:46,360
things I would really add at the end so

451
00:15:43,029 --> 00:15:48,009
we have determined how to tell if the

452
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:50,680
plants are ripe we have determined a

453
00:15:48,009 --> 00:15:52,750
good time to start flushing we know what

454
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:55,299
to put in the water to flush the plants

455
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:57,549
we know why we're flushing we know how

456
00:15:55,299 --> 00:15:59,319
to flush you basically don't mix

457
00:15:57,549 --> 00:16:01,990
anything up and you run that through the

458
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:03,730
plants this will clean out the soil that

459
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:05,680
is our main goal as that's happening

460
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:07,720
we're gonna see colors changing we're

461
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:09,879
gonna see trichomes ripening we're gonna

462
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:12,460
see plants finishing up now you're gonna

463
00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:13,960
get a bunch of funky you may I'm not

464
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:15,400
promising it depends on your genetics

465
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:18,160
your environment it depends on a lot of

466
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:20,259
things you're going to get funky yellow

467
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:23,469
leaves you're gonna get dead foliage

468
00:16:20,259 --> 00:16:24,939
pull that stuff off there's no problem

469
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:26,350
with just yanking that dead stuff off

470
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:28,000
make sure you throw it away get it out

471
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:30,490
of the grow room but just pull all that

472
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,129
dead stuff off and throw it away now

473
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:34,870
about a week maybe five or three days

474
00:16:33,129 --> 00:16:36,669
before you harvest go in the grow room

475
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:38,740
and to start stripping off all the big

476
00:16:36,669 --> 00:16:40,629
leaves this is going to save you a lot

477
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:42,789
of time when it does come time to

478
00:16:40,629 --> 00:16:44,559
harvest there won't be all these big

479
00:16:42,789 --> 00:16:46,209
giant leaves in your way just cut them

480
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:47,619
off while the plant is standing up while

481
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:49,120
they're still stiff while they're still

482
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:50,769
alive you can just snap them right off

483
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,690
pop-pop-pop-pop you can go really fast

484
00:16:50,769 --> 00:16:54,069
you don't even need scissors for it once

485
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:55,750
you get the thumb technique to just pop

486
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:57,640
in a leaf off you can just go in there

487
00:16:55,750 --> 00:17:00,429
and defoliate a whole section really

488
00:16:57,639 --> 00:17:02,289
quickly so a few days before harvest go

489
00:17:00,429 --> 00:17:03,939
in there and pull off all those big

490
00:17:02,289 --> 00:17:05,920
leaves and that will save you a big

491
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:08,078
headache and a bunch of time when it

492
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:09,579
comes time to harvest the plants you

493
00:17:08,078 --> 00:17:11,139
hang them upside down drive and cured

494
00:17:09,578 --> 00:17:13,029
when it comes time to trim half the

495
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:15,520
leaves are already gone it will save you

496
00:17:13,029 --> 00:17:16,990
a lot of [ __ ] and a lot of trouble

497
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:20,170
so what do you see them starting to get

498
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:22,029
funky take off the dead ones then just a

499
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:24,400
few days before harvest probably when

500
00:17:22,029 --> 00:17:25,769
you'd cut out the shine maybe then go in

501
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,000
there and start pulling off the leaves

502
00:17:25,769 --> 00:17:29,470
now another thing you might want to do

503
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,500
is you might want to reduce the

504
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:35,019
temperature just a few degrees do not

505
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:36,910
create a large swingin temps between

506
00:17:35,019 --> 00:17:40,450
your day and night

507
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:42,610
do not go too cold at night do not try

508
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:44,140
to create something drastic if you can

509
00:17:42,609 --> 00:17:45,788
bring it down two or three degrees

510
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:48,309
during the day and two or three degrees

511
00:17:45,788 --> 00:17:50,319
during the night do that but don't go

512
00:17:48,308 --> 00:17:51,759
crazy you guys don't shock the plants

513
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:53,889
right at the end don't give yourself

514
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:55,569
powdery mildew right at the end just try

515
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:57,009
to mimic nature and get a little bit

516
00:17:55,569 --> 00:17:58,808
colder right at the end because what

517
00:17:57,009 --> 00:18:00,400
happens right at the end of the season

518
00:17:58,808 --> 00:18:02,168
it gets cold that's how things know oh

519
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,880
[ __ ] it's wintertime and those plants

520
00:18:02,169 --> 00:18:05,080
will hurry up and finish so you'll see

521
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:07,720
more color you may get a little more

522
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:10,269
density and cool temps are good for

523
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:12,579
terpenes so lower the temperatures a

524
00:18:10,269 --> 00:18:14,349
little bit right at the end now one

525
00:18:12,579 --> 00:18:16,359
thing I'm sure people are going to send

526
00:18:14,349 --> 00:18:19,538
me messages about and ask is do I use

527
00:18:16,359 --> 00:18:21,189
any flushing agents no I do not use a

528
00:18:19,538 --> 00:18:23,890
flushing agent I think all of the

529
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:26,110
flushing agents are kind of a sales

530
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:27,669
tactic they are not necessary and I

531
00:18:26,109 --> 00:18:30,729
think they make your herb taste like

532
00:18:27,669 --> 00:18:32,650
whatever they taste like it's the very

533
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:34,900
end why would I want to put in a new

534
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:37,240
ingredient I want to get everything out

535
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:39,340
so I do not use a flushing agent if I

536
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:41,950
were to use anything I would just use

537
00:18:39,339 --> 00:18:43,509
the the solution I told you the enzymes

538
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:45,519
and the shine and then I would add

539
00:18:43,509 --> 00:18:48,009
powdered coconut water would be the only

540
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:49,298
flushing solution that I would use and a

541
00:18:48,009 --> 00:18:51,220
lot of people are saying what yeah

542
00:18:49,298 --> 00:18:53,200
coconut water would be ideal but that

543
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:54,759
would get very expensive to buy it have

544
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,919
that much coconut water imagine trying

545
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:59,379
to get a five gallon bucket of coconut

546
00:18:56,919 --> 00:19:01,840
water shipped to your house every three

547
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:03,940
days for 14 days that's gonna add up

548
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:06,819
it's gonna get real expensive but you

549
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:08,500
can buy powdered coconut water it is

550
00:19:06,819 --> 00:19:10,839
readily available from a lot of gross

551
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,288
stores bill the soil can take good care

552
00:19:10,839 --> 00:19:12,639
of you

553
00:19:11,288 --> 00:19:14,079
they do not sponsor the show or anything

554
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,480
but I know that that's a reliable source

555
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:19,298
for powdered coconut water also

556
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,950
something I should mention um a lot of

557
00:19:19,298 --> 00:19:23,798
people are growing no-till a lot of

558
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:27,610
people are growing in living soil or

559
00:19:23,798 --> 00:19:29,168
super soil or some sort of live soil you

560
00:19:27,609 --> 00:19:31,569
guys if that is what you're working with

561
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:33,820
you probably do not need to flush

562
00:19:31,569 --> 00:19:35,918
because you have created the perfect

563
00:19:33,819 --> 00:19:37,569
environment inside your plants rise of a

564
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:39,490
spirit or it's taking up what it needs

565
00:19:37,569 --> 00:19:40,990
you're not feeding it bottled nutrients

566
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:43,179
it's not being force-fed [ __ ] so it

567
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:44,589
doesn't need to be flushed anything our

568
00:19:43,179 --> 00:19:46,150
buddies some cool when he would mix up a

569
00:19:44,589 --> 00:19:48,428
batch of super soil and put a plant in

570
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:49,840
there he would just beat it water for

571
00:19:48,429 --> 00:19:50,620
the whole flowering phase and he would

572
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:53,230
say I've been

573
00:19:50,619 --> 00:19:55,750
flushing the entire time so before

574
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:57,519
people start sending me emails yes there

575
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:59,230
are some situations where you may not

576
00:19:57,519 --> 00:20:01,569
need to flush if you were going no-till

577
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:03,910
if you're going all organic flushing is

578
00:20:01,569 --> 00:20:05,829
not a thing now if you're running that

579
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:07,360
you're already up to speed and you know

580
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:09,460
that we don't need to teach you about

581
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:11,769
flushing you were in the advanced

582
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:12,970
blackbelt class already I've got one

583
00:20:11,769 --> 00:20:15,039
more thing I should mention before I

584
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:16,390
wrap up this so-called quicky episode

585
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:17,619
that's gone on for 20 minutes you guys

586
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:21,309
are very welcome thank you for listening

587
00:20:17,619 --> 00:20:25,779
um a good thing to do is to measure the

588
00:20:21,308 --> 00:20:27,069
EC or the ppm of your runoff water you

589
00:20:25,779 --> 00:20:29,379
are pouring a bunch of water into your

590
00:20:27,069 --> 00:20:30,490
plants right collect it collect the

591
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:31,870
water that comes out of the bottom of

592
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:34,870
your plant into some sort of a vessel

593
00:20:31,869 --> 00:20:38,139
put your pH pen in there put your EC or

594
00:20:34,869 --> 00:20:40,058
ppm pen in there and see what the EC is

595
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:42,009
now if you're in a soil or a soilless

596
00:20:40,058 --> 00:20:44,440
mix you're only gonna get down so low if

597
00:20:42,009 --> 00:20:46,629
you're in cocoa you can get those PPM's

598
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:48,610
down really really low see how low you

599
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:51,730
can get it maybe before you start

600
00:20:48,609 --> 00:20:53,799
flushing that day the first day you

601
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:55,599
flush measure what comes out then

602
00:20:53,799 --> 00:20:56,678
measure each time and see how low you

603
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:58,569
can get it and then just keep

604
00:20:56,679 --> 00:21:00,759
experimenting see how low it goes every

605
00:20:58,569 --> 00:21:02,079
day and see how low you can get the ppm

606
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:03,640
s I don't want to give any

607
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:05,349
recommendations on how low to try and

608
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:07,059
get it because it's going to vary based

609
00:21:05,349 --> 00:21:08,829
on your medium and I don't want to [ __ ]

610
00:21:07,058 --> 00:21:10,480
up your Gro you're going to have to

611
00:21:08,829 --> 00:21:12,129
learn this based on your grow cocoa

612
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,259
you'll get it really low because cocoa

613
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:16,059
is inert cocoa is not gonna hold [ __ ]

614
00:21:14,259 --> 00:21:17,529
same thing with rockwool you'll be able

615
00:21:16,058 --> 00:21:20,109
to get the PPM's of your rock wall and

616
00:21:17,529 --> 00:21:22,329
your cocoa down to amazingly low levels

617
00:21:20,109 --> 00:21:24,308
soil soilless mixes those are still

618
00:21:22,329 --> 00:21:26,500
gonna have some high ppm s because they

619
00:21:24,308 --> 00:21:28,629
are soil and soilless mixes there's just

620
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:30,700
a lot of [ __ ] in there but play with

621
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:32,260
your runoff pay attention to that see

622
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:34,090
how low you can get it and it'll be a

623
00:21:32,259 --> 00:21:36,039
lot of fun it'll be a fun experiment and

624
00:21:34,089 --> 00:21:37,449
then you'll actually see what's going in

625
00:21:36,039 --> 00:21:38,740
and what's coming out of your plants

626
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:40,960
maybe we should just talk about

627
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:43,150
measuring runoff anyway in a full

628
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,009
episode we'll talk about checking the EC

629
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:46,450
or the PPM's of a solution before you

630
00:21:45,009 --> 00:21:47,049
pour it into your plants and then we'll

631
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:50,140
remesh

632
00:21:47,049 --> 00:21:51,460
that same solution the EC or the P P PMS

633
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:53,650
when it comes out of the bottom of your

634
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:55,299
plants and we'll compare that to the pH

635
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:57,190
going in and the pH coming out and we'll

636
00:21:55,299 --> 00:21:59,889
see what's happening in your rhizosphere

637
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:02,200
anyway that's a future episode I'm just

638
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:04,340
getting excited you guys measure the

639
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:05,840
electrical conductivity or the particles

640
00:22:04,339 --> 00:22:07,730
million of what's coming out of your

641
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:09,769
plant and you will know if you need to

642
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:11,720
flush more or not and then when you cut

643
00:22:09,769 --> 00:22:12,918
it down right down the ppm s and then

644
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:15,259
pay attention and then if you are

645
00:22:12,919 --> 00:22:16,820
satisfied hit that number next time and

646
00:22:15,259 --> 00:22:18,919
if you're not satisfied maybe flush a

647
00:22:16,819 --> 00:22:20,480
little longer and try to go lower but

648
00:22:18,919 --> 00:22:22,429
they'll be discouraged because it's not

649
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,048
all about the flush you still have dry

650
00:22:22,429 --> 00:22:26,509
and cure to [ __ ] this up you could ruin

651
00:22:24,048 --> 00:22:27,918
your whole crop after you cut it down so

652
00:22:26,509 --> 00:22:30,500
ladies and gentlemen I want to thank you

653
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:33,009
for listening to my flushing episode so

654
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:35,269
so far we have done determining ripeness

655
00:22:33,009 --> 00:22:37,519
determining when to flush we have talked

656
00:22:35,269 --> 00:22:40,250
about flushing I think the next episode

657
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:42,798
in line is harvesting and then after

658
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:43,669
that we're going to do the dry and pure

659
00:22:42,798 --> 00:22:45,230
episodes there will be some

660
00:22:43,669 --> 00:22:46,640
interruptions to that schedule because

661
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:48,558
I've got an episode scheduled with some

662
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:51,230
friends and things always pop up but

663
00:22:48,558 --> 00:22:53,089
those are on the chart to come up in

664
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:54,558

679
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:23,630
for free I'm really not trying to get

680
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:25,009
rich off of podcasting but there are a

681
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:27,260
few people who said they would like to

682
00:23:25,009 --> 00:23:29,898
contribute to the podcast I like to make

683
00:23:27,259 --> 00:23:32,269
sure there is an opportunity for that it

684
00:23:29,898 --> 00:23:34,099
is patreon.com slash grow from your

685
00:23:32,269 --> 00:23:35,808
heart what I will do with those funds is

686
00:23:34,099 --> 00:23:38,928
I will pay for my website you guys I

687
00:23:35,808 --> 00:23:40,519
host this podcast on my website it costs

688
00:23:38,929 --> 00:23:40,880
a little bit of money to do that every

689
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:43,038
year

690
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:45,528
also I purchased a better MacBook so

691
00:23:43,038 --> 00:23:47,629
that I can record more efficiently my

692
00:23:45,528 --> 00:23:48,980
old computer was not efficient as the

693
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:50,450
polite way to say it but the

694
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:52,159
contributions will help to go pay for

695
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:54,288
the MacBook that I bought and also cover

696
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:55,370
the cost of the website also you may

697
00:23:54,288 --> 00:23:56,599
have heard Mike mentioned that the

698
00:23:55,369 --> 00:23:59,178
little microphone cover needed a

699
00:23:56,599 --> 00:24:01,278
replacement I use the funding for things

700
00:23:59,179 --> 00:24:02,600
like that so if you'd like to contribute

701
00:24:01,278 --> 00:24:04,548
I would appreciate it I will quit

702
00:24:02,599 --> 00:24:06,829
begging because that got uncomfortable

703
00:24:04,548 --> 00:24:08,028

717

how to grow cannabis right there on the

721
00:24:39,048 --> 00:24:43,039
spot I think it's fun because there's no

722
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,539
notes there's no preparation today

723
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:46,308
somebody asked me a fairly in-depth

724
00:24:44,539 --> 00:24:47,659
question and I had to stare into the sky

725
00:24:46,308 --> 00:24:50,119
and roll my eyes for about two minutes

726
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:51,440
and try to board out the reply I was

727
00:24:50,119 --> 00:24:53,479
trying to give them because I wasn't

728
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,980
prepared and it's really a lot of fun

729
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:56,870
for me it's kind of like it's like a

730
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:58,730
game of stuff the grower or stuff the

731
00:24:56,869 --> 00:25:00,529
breeder or something like that and I

732
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:02,329
