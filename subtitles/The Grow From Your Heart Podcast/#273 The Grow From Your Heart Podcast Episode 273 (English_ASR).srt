50
00:02:25,829 --> 00:02:30,180
plenty of dabs we're gonna bring you an

51
00:02:28,019 --> 00:02:31,680
amazing podcast I promise you in this

52
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:33,750
episode we're gonna talk about an email

53
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,250
that I was sent a friend of ours in I

54
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:38,669
think he's in Michigan we'll verify that

55
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:40,799
in the email he is awaiting and

56
00:02:38,669 --> 00:02:43,169
anticipating the legalization of

57
00:02:40,799 --> 00:02:44,969
cannabis in his area and he wants to be

58
00:02:43,169 --> 00:02:46,979
properly prepared and he wants to know

59
00:02:44,969 --> 00:02:49,259
how to get a jump on things basically

60
00:02:46,979 --> 00:02:51,000
and then he also he's got a legislation

61
00:02:49,259 --> 00:02:52,530
question lined up for Mike and then he's

62
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,299
got a grow question lined up for me so

63
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:55,530
that'll probably take up most of the

64
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:57,390
episode and I'm also going to read a

65
00:02:55,530 --> 00:03:00,329
Facebook post from somebody in the

66
00:02:57,389 --> 00:03:02,369
cannabis community and I also hope to

67
00:03:00,329 --> 00:03:03,570
get to an email you know we'll start

68
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:05,250
with that one cuz it'll be quick I hope

69
00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:07,199
to get to an email a message that we

70
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:09,479
received from Instagram we'll probably

71
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:12,268
start with that but before we get that

72
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:13,679
far they might let everybody on that's

73
00:03:12,269 --> 00:03:15,299
listening let everybody know how they

74
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,439
can stalk you on social media so that

75
00:03:15,299 --> 00:03:17,909

lot before we get there I want to talk

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,779
about the breeding project that I keep

91
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:19,310
telling everybody about I am making I've

92
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:20,629
gotten a rise mail if you haven't been

93
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:21,439
updated yet if you don't listen to the

94
00:04:20,629 --> 00:04:24,949
show regularly

95
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:29,839
I am breeding I am I region is breeding

96
00:04:24,949 --> 00:04:31,219
cannabis plans their children if you

97
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:32,810
haven't been listening let's catch you

98
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:35,360
all the way breeding piranhas

99
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:37,280
I'm breeding cannabis plants I made the

100
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,729
arise arises a strain that I made it

101
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:43,129
recently tested at 31 percent THC a it

102
00:04:40,728 --> 00:04:45,529
is in cross of golden goat and a day

103
00:04:43,129 --> 00:04:48,529
breaker it is a regular seat it is not

104
00:04:45,529 --> 00:04:50,689
feminized I just tested 31 percent THC I

105
00:04:48,529 --> 00:04:52,489
searched through about a hundred seeds

106
00:04:50,689 --> 00:04:54,168
maybe more than a hundred to find the

107
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:57,560
male plant that I want I've got a really

108
00:04:54,168 --> 00:05:00,918
killer male I have also got a few

109
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:03,709
phenotypes of females of the same strain

110
00:05:00,918 --> 00:05:05,629
those are all in a room together the

111
00:05:03,709 --> 00:05:06,799
male has been removed his pollen did its

112
00:05:05,629 --> 00:05:08,600
thing the male has been pulled out of

113
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,610
there there is also a lemon skunk plant

114
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:13,129
in there there's a golden goat plant in

115
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:15,410
there for experimental reasons and there

116
00:05:13,129 --> 00:05:16,819
is also a grateful dog plant in there

117
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:18,820
because I wanted to make the arize

118
00:05:16,819 --> 00:05:21,228
crossed a grateful dog those are my two

119
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:21,829
flagship that I'm known for right - my

120
00:05:21,228 --> 00:05:23,659
favorite

121
00:05:21,829 --> 00:05:24,829
yes - of a lot of people's favorites so

122
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:26,389
I put them together we'll see what

123
00:05:24,829 --> 00:05:28,879
happens to that there will not be any

124
00:05:26,389 --> 00:05:30,590
retail grateful dog to arise seeds for a

125
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:33,279
long time I made a very small batch this

126
00:05:30,589 --> 00:05:35,409
is the beginning of the project folks

127
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:37,899
do you rise however I just made f to

128
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:39,220
arise mail hit the arise females and I

129
00:05:37,899 --> 00:05:43,149
made f2 and by hitting multiple

130
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:45,880
phenotypes of the females I have made a

131
00:05:43,149 --> 00:05:47,949
nice option for selection for variation

132
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:50,139
for my f3 so I'll get to see what that

133
00:05:47,949 --> 00:05:51,969
plant what that what that plant

134
00:05:50,139 --> 00:05:53,919
expresses in a lot of different ways so

135
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:57,100
I'll be able to pick a very good male

136
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:58,569
and a very good female to make the f3

137
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,730
I'm actually my goal is to take this to

138
00:05:58,569 --> 00:06:02,800
f5 and I'm trying not to rush it I want

139
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:05,230
to go through and find the exact more

140
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,939
time and the more planes' is sort of the

141
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:09,129
better is the rule of thumb in these

142
00:06:06,939 --> 00:06:13,180
projects yes you know my encouragement

143
00:06:09,129 --> 00:06:17,319
is to go slow selection is key when it

144
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:19,870
comes to this so I believe that if I hit

145
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:21,279
multiple females with one male and then

146
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:22,930
I pull seeds from and I keep them

147
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:25,509
separate and then I find that golden

148
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:27,280
male I don't have to use I see I've got

149
00:06:25,509 --> 00:06:29,349
the females are labeled actually what

150
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:30,879
they actually are is there's number four

151
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:33,610
okay the keepers the ones that are going

152
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:35,680
to survive to another run are four eight

153
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:37,210
and one that was lettered e from a

154
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:41,199
previous run those are the three that

155
00:06:37,209 --> 00:06:42,689
are amazing phenotypes of a rise ladies

156
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:46,899
yeah those will stick around for a while

157
00:06:42,689 --> 00:06:48,370
those a three the Irie three a little

158
00:06:46,899 --> 00:06:51,120
bit the male I call him Solomon it's a

159
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:54,310
rise he's a male his name is solomon i

160
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:58,509
feels it alpha sure i'll see diversity

161
00:06:54,310 --> 00:07:01,540
and i'm a pick a male from number three

162
00:06:58,509 --> 00:07:03,430
or e and then i'm a pick a female from

163
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:05,560
number four and i may breathe that way

164
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:06,730
which that's still the same finial

165
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,560
generation and it's still the same

166
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:10,300
genetic so I'm still making F threes but

167
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:16,180
it gives me a little shoe a lot of

168
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:17,949
variation and otherwise because you are

169
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:20,470
and I'm trying to narrow it down to

170
00:07:17,949 --> 00:07:21,819
where it almost looks like clones when

171
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:23,800
you grow these seeds by the time I get

172
00:07:21,819 --> 00:07:25,540
to f5 I want to be able to say yeah it's

173
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:28,000
gonna look like this and it's basically

174
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:31,360
a clone that's that's my goal so that's

175
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,649
where I'm taking that if you're if

176
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:37,120
you're not quite as nerdy as we are what

177
00:07:34,649 --> 00:07:38,859
we get out of here the goal all of this

178
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,250
is to find the best of the best of the

179
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,500
best

180
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:42,839
yes

181
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:44,850
and basically what that takes is a lot

182
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:49,159
of trial and error in a lot of

183
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:52,500
willingness to kill off plants and

184
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:55,020
towards the end or at the end the goal

185
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:57,540
is you'll be able to put a ten pack of

186
00:07:55,019 --> 00:07:59,819
seeds in the ground and have all of them

187
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:03,270
come up very very very similar very

188
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:05,490
stable and that's what you're looking

189
00:08:03,269 --> 00:08:07,259
for were for a market ready product and

190
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:10,439
that's not often what you get when

191
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:12,389
you're buying seeds a lot of was fair

192
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:14,370
I'll say that that's fair a lot of what

193
00:08:12,389 --> 00:08:16,769
is available and even a lot of what I am

194
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:19,649
making and what is available for myself

195
00:08:16,769 --> 00:08:24,599
Aref ones which means that they have not

196
00:08:19,649 --> 00:08:26,699
been f2 which I took a male of one

197
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:28,680
strain and a female of another and I put

198
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:30,120
pollen on it and it made seeds and I

199
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,319
tested them plenty before they were

200
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,210
released there are a lot of seed

201
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:35,129
companies that do that but that's what a

202
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:41,839
lot of my stuff is but guys like DJ

203
00:08:35,129 --> 00:08:41,838
shoes that's how gaijin genetics does it

204
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:49,470
that's one of each strain like a

205
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:51,330
greenhouse will sell you well I've seen

206
00:08:49,470 --> 00:09:04,170
it from a number of the major companies

207
00:08:51,330 --> 00:09:06,028
where you'll get it in I mean just trial

208
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:08,669
and error with germination alone makes

209
00:09:06,028 --> 00:09:11,939
that silly yeah but when you know as

210
00:09:08,669 --> 00:09:14,490
much as we do about like expression and

211
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:18,770
plant stabilization and this is likely

212
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:18,769
an f1 or maybe if I'm lucky an f2

213
00:09:19,139 --> 00:09:26,939
you know if I've only got one seal I'll

214
00:09:20,549 --> 00:09:28,979
make sure work my lemons cook that I

215
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:31,050
have came as a gift seed from somebody

216
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:33,120
else and I got one of them and it was a

217
00:09:31,049 --> 00:09:34,469
gift from green from somebody else did

218
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,899
and they got it from green house seeds

219
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:39,000
and they got one I've grown a few killer

220
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:41,309
one-offs in my day as well and that that

221
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,950
one that I kept that I have is what I

222
00:09:41,309 --> 00:09:46,708
have bred the lemon Geoffrey and cascade

223
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:48,900
from one of your first big breeding

224
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:50,250
projects had a plant I can never

225
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:52,299
remember it was the Bubblegum with a

226
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:54,490
grapefruit some of the best stuff

227
00:09:52,299 --> 00:09:55,870
smoke to this day and it was just the

228
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:57,730
one off that we couldn't find again

229
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:59,289
right yeah I say sometimes if I don't

230
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:01,330
like the way stuff grows or whatever it

231
00:09:59,289 --> 00:10:04,480
is I remember it grew atrociously but

232
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:10,900
the flavor of it was just was the

233
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:11,950
grapefruit if I don't like whey plant

234
00:10:10,899 --> 00:10:13,689
grows I'll just get rid of it because

235
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:15,490
like we're saying I've got so many seeds

236
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:17,980
when I just run more seeds to replace

237
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:19,810
that and have the best of the best you

238
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:22,379
don't want something you can find a 10

239
00:10:19,809 --> 00:10:25,000
you don't want a bunch of sevens around

240
00:10:22,379 --> 00:10:28,600
yeah all right so the breeding project I

241
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:31,870
am speaking of is approximately 62 ish

242
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:34,480
days tomorrow will be tomorrow be the

243
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:37,149
start of week 10 so it's 63 days it's 9

244
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:39,129
weeks in which means it's just about

245
00:10:37,149 --> 00:10:40,449
done I've been taking out water I've

246
00:10:39,129 --> 00:10:42,250
taken out three have taken out four

247
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:44,410
seeds now the fourth seed looked

248
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:47,649
completely ready so I'm letting it ripen

249
00:10:44,409 --> 00:10:49,629
up and then tomorrow is Monday hopefully

250
00:10:47,649 --> 00:10:51,279
if I get all of my work done at a

251
00:10:49,629 --> 00:10:53,139
reasonable hour by the end of Monday I

252
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:57,240
may go in there and start chopping down

253
00:10:53,139 --> 00:10:59,679
plants of the new arise f2 project I'm

254
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:01,330
loving it I'm excited for it

255
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:02,709
it's just a small run it won't take me a

256
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:10,660
lot of trimming the way I'll do it is

257
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:12,490
I'm gonna cut down one plant pretty

258
00:11:10,659 --> 00:11:14,439
small plants yep so I'll cut them down

259
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:17,019
take off all the big leaves hang them

260
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:19,540
upside down I let them dry until they're

261
00:11:17,019 --> 00:11:21,149
fairly fairly crispy basically and then

262
00:11:19,539 --> 00:11:23,349
just cut off a branch hold it over

263
00:11:21,149 --> 00:11:28,750
either a Tupperware dish or a pie plate

264
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:31,269
and crumble it up just like old school

265
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:32,500
weed and just crunch it up and let the

266
00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:35,199
seeds fall out and then pull out the

267
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:36,789
seeds pull out the material we may roll

268
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,230
some joints with the dried material but

269
00:11:36,789 --> 00:11:40,089
then a lot of its gonna get turned into

270
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:41,740
concentrates will have some BHO coming

271
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:43,389
up here in just a little while but then

272
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:45,039
all upset the seeds aside let them dry

273
00:11:43,389 --> 00:11:46,659
out real well get them nice and hard and

274
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:48,189
then I will put them into little

275
00:11:46,659 --> 00:11:50,949
packages I need to get some packages

276
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:52,420
from le containers calm and then get

277
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:53,560
those lined up get a few of them into

278
00:11:52,419 --> 00:11:54,969
some packages and get them out to my

279
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:57,459
friends that test them out for me and

280
00:11:54,970 --> 00:12:00,580
then I will grow it myself and I will

281
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:03,220
see if the arize f2s are worth growing

282
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:04,690
worth making more of or if I selected

283
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:05,800
the wrong mail that I'll go back and

284
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:08,110
find another boy

285
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:10,118
try again but since I've used multiple

286
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:12,159
females I'll keep all the female

287
00:12:10,119 --> 00:12:15,100
separate keep the seeds separated and I

288
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:17,078
will run comparisons of batch a batch B

289
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:18,850
batch C and I will see which ones I like

290
00:12:17,078 --> 00:12:20,799
better so that I could find my breeders

291
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:22,689
I'm gonna do a lot of research and a lot

292
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:24,758
of work and a lot of looking before I

293
00:12:22,688 --> 00:12:26,498
even continue before I even think about

294
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:28,239
making it up to I want to really see

295
00:12:26,499 --> 00:12:29,829
what the effort before I make an f3 I

296
00:12:28,239 --> 00:12:31,689
wanna see what the f2 s really really do

297
00:12:29,828 --> 00:12:33,159
so it's almost time to take those down

298
00:12:31,688 --> 00:12:45,368
probably tomorrow night when I get done

299
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:46,988
doing all my work then me too so I want

300
00:12:45,369 --> 00:12:49,110
to talk about one more thing before we

301
00:12:46,989 --> 00:12:52,860
get into some of the main topics a

302
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:55,928
couple of so let me go way far back

303
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:57,789
about a year and a half ago we're coming

304
00:12:55,928 --> 00:13:00,789
up on two years almost a year in three

305
00:12:57,789 --> 00:13:04,298
quarters ago I hit my head I hit the

306
00:13:00,789 --> 00:13:06,368
[ __ ] out of my head I hit my head low

307
00:13:04,298 --> 00:13:09,369
doorway I'm six five the doorway it was

308
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:10,839
probably six three I was walking fast

309
00:13:09,369 --> 00:13:12,850
enough to her when I hit the top of my

310
00:13:10,839 --> 00:13:14,860
head on this doorway it knocked me clean

311
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:16,808
the [ __ ] out I was walking to some

312
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:18,850
stairs I hit my head knocked myself out

313
00:13:16,808 --> 00:13:20,740
completely unconscious I went spaghetti

314
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:22,360
and fell down the stairs while I was

315
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:23,829
completely unconscious I have a couple

316
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:26,110
of friends wake me up carry me up the

317
00:13:23,828 --> 00:13:27,758
stairs get me in a chair trying to get

318
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:29,919
my [ __ ] back together I was broken you

319
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:31,688
guys I had a traumatic brain injury I

320
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:33,610
had some serious problems my vision was

321
00:13:31,688 --> 00:13:36,789
not right my brain was not right my word

322
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:38,528
association wasn't happening properly my

323
00:13:36,789 --> 00:13:39,998
name's I couldn't remembers people's

324
00:13:38,528 --> 00:13:41,318
names like my best friend's would be

325
00:13:39,999 --> 00:13:43,389
sitting at the table I couldn't tell you

326
00:13:41,318 --> 00:13:44,798
what the [ __ ] their names were I was

327
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:47,678
broken I was having problems I was

328
00:13:44,798 --> 00:13:49,119
having physical problems related to it

329
00:13:47,678 --> 00:13:51,938
like my body would not regulate its

330
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:53,019
temperature it was wintertime uh and I

331
00:13:51,938 --> 00:13:54,759
was running around in just like a

332
00:13:53,019 --> 00:13:55,778
t-shirt and everyone's in coats and [ __ ]

333
00:13:54,759 --> 00:13:57,909
they're looking to me like do kind of

334
00:13:55,778 --> 00:13:59,860
drugs or you want a head injury drugs

335
00:13:57,909 --> 00:14:02,159
I'm just [ __ ] sweaty all the time now

336
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:04,480
like it would not stop being overheated

337
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:06,039
but something that was also funky was my

338
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,899
vision my vision would get wobbly

339
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:10,028
sometimes like if I would watch certain

340
00:14:07,899 --> 00:14:11,948
like animated [ __ ] or certain TV shows

341
00:14:10,028 --> 00:14:13,058
filmed a certain way my vision would get

342
00:14:11,948 --> 00:14:15,128
weird and I just have to quit watching

343
00:14:13,058 --> 00:14:16,568
it certain video games and [ __ ] with my

344
00:14:15,129 --> 00:14:16,980
head if I don't really play video games

345
00:14:16,568 --> 00:14:18,539
but

346
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:22,019
watch other people play some games have

347
00:14:18,539 --> 00:14:23,278
messed with my head nothing's really

348
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:25,440
messed with me for a little while I was

349
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:26,399
having dizzy spells a little while for a

350
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,410
little while but everything's pretty

351
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:31,078
much back to normal I fink I'm back on

352
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:32,789
track from all that until I recorded

353
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:33,778
that episode at elevate a couple of

354
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:35,219
weeks ago if you guys listen to the

355
00:14:33,778 --> 00:14:37,559
podcast I went to elevate and record a

356
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:44,129
show there is a rig there by an artist

357
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:45,328
named Matt Cameron no it's not Cameron

358
00:14:44,129 --> 00:14:46,708
Reed let me correct myself

359
00:14:45,328 --> 00:14:47,819
I think Matt cameras a drummer that I

360
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:49,500
watched a video from the other day but

361
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:51,660
the dude's name is Cameron Reed Cameron

362
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:53,850
Reed glass on Instagram this dude made a

363
00:14:51,659 --> 00:14:55,708
rig and the work is called red a cello

364
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:57,540
or ready work is what they call it and

365
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:59,549
it's just clear glass with white lines

366
00:14:57,539 --> 00:15:01,139
through it and it's [ __ ] beautiful so

367
00:14:59,549 --> 00:15:03,629
I saw this rig and when I stared at the

368
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:06,778
rig it started moving it had kind of a

369
00:15:03,629 --> 00:15:09,028
Christmas ornament glass kind of quality

370
00:15:06,778 --> 00:15:10,799
to it if if that helps describe it for

371
00:15:09,028 --> 00:15:13,549
the listeners it's trippy to my brain

372
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:15,838
dude it makes my brain do weird [ __ ]

373
00:15:13,549 --> 00:15:17,069
looks like it's moving all of those

374
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:30,449
wines look like they're spinning around

375
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:32,250
like Tron it was crazy but then I post

376
00:15:30,448 --> 00:15:33,389
on Facebook basically my experience is

377
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:35,698
like I fell in love with this rig

378
00:15:33,389 --> 00:15:37,440
unfortunately you guys this rig is I

379
00:15:35,698 --> 00:15:39,328
looked at the price tag from underneath

380
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,680
because the price tags on the bottom and

381
00:15:39,328 --> 00:15:42,239
a glut of the shelf it's sitting on his

382
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:44,489
glass so I could see through it it's

383
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,778
either twenty one hundred or twenty four

384
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:48,389
hundred dollars I couldn't read if that

385
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:50,429
was a one-er of four that's not in my

386
00:15:48,389 --> 00:15:52,528
budget to spend on a glass rig to tell

387
00:15:50,429 --> 00:15:56,219
you the damn truth I would be awesome to

388
00:15:52,528 --> 00:15:57,899
have I just stare at it some more so I

389
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:59,910
mentioned this on Facebook I posted up

390
00:15:57,899 --> 00:16:02,339
to Facebook and Instagram I pretty much

391
00:15:59,909 --> 00:16:03,958
told the same story hit my head my eyes

392
00:16:02,339 --> 00:16:05,370
were [ __ ] up and then I saw this rig

393
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:06,929
and I was mesmerised and that I'm in

394
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:09,810
love with it so I posted a picture of

395
00:16:06,929 --> 00:16:13,979
the rig and the artist that made the rig

396
00:16:09,809 --> 00:16:16,289
contacted me and sent me a sweet pendant

397
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:19,139
he sent me a disk pendant it's probably

398
00:16:16,289 --> 00:16:20,490
the size it's bigger than a silver

399
00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:22,680
dollars just a little bit bigger than a

400
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:24,389
silver dollar or yeah a little bigger

401
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:27,069
than a silver dollar it's got some great

402
00:16:24,389 --> 00:16:28,990
ready work it's got a

403
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:30,100
[ __ ] it's gonna open the middle of it

404
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:32,289
I always forgot the name of the opals

405

I had the dopest pin of the sesh alright

436
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:41,220
oh let's get to the the main topic of

437
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:42,660
this podcast a screen shot - because I

438
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:44,519
like to screenshot the messages it makes

439
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:45,840
it much easier for me to find them it

440
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:48,349
really does we've got a really quick

441
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:50,490
message this one came from Instagram um

442
00:18:48,349 --> 00:18:52,379
usually I don't see the names but this

443
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:54,359
dude he's from North Carolina and his

444
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:57,330
name is Carolina cannabis so follow him

445
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:59,009
on Instagram he says what's something I

446
00:18:57,329 --> 00:19:01,379
can use for food for plants beside

447
00:18:59,009 --> 00:19:03,480
besides buying nutrients in a bottle

448
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:05,220
growing outdoors at North Carolina only

449
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:07,289
a few weeks of flowering left

450
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:10,410
surprisingly buds are decently fat but I

451
00:19:07,289 --> 00:19:12,149
know she's probably hungry for something

452
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:14,460
I'm gonna try to get this episode out to

453
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:19,550
you as soon as we can because you need

454
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:29,220
this information pretty quickly you say

455
00:19:19,549 --> 00:19:33,720
only a few weeks left of flowering but

456
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:34,920
then the grower in me says jesse is on

457
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,390
the coast right now having a good time I

458
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:48,539
think Jesse's in Portland is where I

459
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:50,520
think Mike Mike nailed what I thought

460
00:19:48,539 --> 00:19:51,928
most people would say you want to use

461
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:53,910
some guano's you're gonna want to use

462
00:19:51,929 --> 00:19:56,309
some alfalfa meal you're gonna want to

463
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:57,808
use something like that but you've only

464
00:19:56,308 --> 00:19:59,069
got a couple of weeks left so you don't

465
00:19:57,808 --> 00:20:00,899
want to pump a whole bunch of stuff into

466
00:19:59,069 --> 00:20:03,240
the plants and if most of those organic

467
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:05,490
products are gonna take at least two

468
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:14,970
weeks to four weeks to closer to six or

469
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:16,410
eight nature wise the plants supposed to

470
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:19,710
reviews though most were surrounded by

471
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:20,820
now yes like that's as intended so but

472
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:22,289
there are a couple of things that you

473
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:23,849
can do if you don't want to go buy a

474
00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:25,529
bottle so you've only got a few weeks

475
00:20:23,849 --> 00:20:27,089
left so keep in mind that you're gonna

476
00:20:25,529 --> 00:20:28,678
want to flush even outdoors you need to

477
00:20:27,089 --> 00:20:30,000
flush your plants you need a time period

478
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:31,530
where they're not receiving any

479
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,940
nutrients so that they can start to get

480
00:20:31,529 --> 00:20:34,980
rid of the [ __ ] that's stored up in them

481
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:37,940
so that your buds burn and taste and

482
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:39,990
smell perfectly at the right time so

483
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:43,140
keep that in mind give yourself

484
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:44,880
hopefully 10 to 14 maybe 15 to 16 maybe

485
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:45,538
20 days I like to flush for a long time

486
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,039
well if you

487
00:20:45,538 --> 00:20:48,450
haven't been feeding up to this point

488
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:50,128
either you don't want to hit him with

489
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:52,528
too much now you'll shock the hell out

490
00:20:50,128 --> 00:20:54,089
of you probably if he says he knows

491
00:20:52,528 --> 00:20:55,589
they're probably hungry for something if

492
00:20:54,089 --> 00:20:58,709
he hasn't boosted them up they probably

493
00:20:55,589 --> 00:21:01,138
are and what I would recommend if you

494
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:02,970
want to feed them something like I said

495
00:21:01,138 --> 00:21:04,918
earlier some guano's would be cool some

496
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:06,569
stuff like that would be cool but some

497
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:08,669
comfrey would be nice maybe make up an

498
00:21:06,569 --> 00:21:12,329
iced tea that's probably your best bet

499
00:21:08,669 --> 00:21:14,809
make a tea um a tea with some worm

500
00:21:12,329 --> 00:21:18,028
castings some alfalfa meal in there

501
00:21:14,808 --> 00:21:19,918
maybe put a little tiny bit of molasses

502
00:21:18,028 --> 00:21:21,868
in there just to keep it moving and then

503
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:23,249
any sort of kelp meal or something make

504
00:21:21,868 --> 00:21:25,259
a tea out of that and this is just

505
00:21:23,249 --> 00:21:27,118
coming to me so I'm trying to go as

506
00:21:25,259 --> 00:21:28,919
smoothly as I can here maybe put some

507
00:21:27,118 --> 00:21:31,288
I'm not sure what all you are willing to

508
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:32,849
use either but kelp meal would

509
00:21:31,288 --> 00:21:35,429
definitely help you get some bulk and

510
00:21:32,848 --> 00:21:36,569
some flavor maybe put some fish Hydra

511
00:21:35,429 --> 00:21:38,820
slates in there that would help you all

512
00:21:36,569 --> 00:21:40,618
with some nitrogen and that's up if you

513
00:21:38,819 --> 00:21:43,348
make a tea like this brew it up for just

514
00:21:40,618 --> 00:21:44,908
a couple of few days and if you need

515
00:21:43,348 --> 00:21:46,470
instructions on making a tea send me an

516
00:21:44,909 --> 00:21:47,849
email and we'll try to get Jesse on here

517
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:49,679
to help us with that but I'll answer you

518
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:51,148
you sent me this message on Instagram so

519
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:52,320
send me a message on Instagram and

520
00:21:51,148 --> 00:21:54,658
hopefully I can run these through making

521
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:56,878
a tea it's really easy but make it tea

522
00:21:54,659 --> 00:21:59,970
feed the plants the tea if you can't

523
00:21:56,878 --> 00:22:02,519
make a tea then some basic fish Hydra

524
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:04,288
sleights in a bottle would work for that

525
00:22:02,519 --> 00:22:06,089
put some water into a five-gallon bucket

526
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:07,858
put a little more than what the label

527
00:22:06,089 --> 00:22:09,538
says of fish hydro slates in there mix

528
00:22:07,858 --> 00:22:11,908
it up real well put some molasses in

529
00:22:09,538 --> 00:22:14,009
there mix that up and then maybe some

530
00:22:11,909 --> 00:22:15,330
kelp any sort of kelp product that you

531
00:22:14,009 --> 00:22:16,769
can put in there liquid kelp would be

532
00:22:15,329 --> 00:22:18,210
more available but that's a bottled

533
00:22:16,769 --> 00:22:20,538
product if you don't want to do that I

534
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:22,619
think a tea would be your best way to go

535
00:22:20,538 --> 00:22:24,868
Jesse and I have done episodes about

536
00:22:22,618 --> 00:22:26,728
making teas that is a thing that's

537
00:22:24,868 --> 00:22:28,108
available if you don't want to search

538
00:22:26,729 --> 00:22:30,659
for that send me a message I'll either

539
00:22:28,108 --> 00:22:32,489
find it for you or I will reply to you

540
00:22:30,659 --> 00:22:35,940
on Instagram I was just doing the math

541
00:22:32,489 --> 00:22:39,710
in my head this is gonna come out if

542
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:39,710
this show doesn't come out immediately

543
00:22:40,849 --> 00:22:46,519
he's she's only got three weeks from

544
00:22:42,859 --> 00:22:48,469
recording it at most of Gro time left if

545
00:22:46,519 --> 00:22:50,240
he's on the East Coast if I've got my

546
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:51,920
numbers right my ass some of our friends

547
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:56,180
in Colorado are actually harvesting this

548
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:58,279
music having higher up in elevation than

549
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:59,650
we are down here in Pueblo that are a

550
00:22:58,279 --> 00:23:04,069
little further up into the foothills

551
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:06,440
harvest began last week and I mean

552
00:23:04,069 --> 00:23:07,909
they're dipping below 50 at night this

553
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:10,070
is what's up the plants are done you

554
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:12,200
should see them they're huge I actually

555
00:23:10,069 --> 00:23:14,089
went to two different grows one that was

556
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:17,210
about 700 feet higher up in elevation

557
00:23:14,089 --> 00:23:20,329
than the other when I went to the higher

558
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:21,710
one first buds were almost done they

559
00:23:20,329 --> 00:23:24,859
they were gonna give him three more days

560
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:27,049
at harvest I drove down the road a few

561
00:23:24,859 --> 00:23:29,119
hundred feet and buds were three weeks

562
00:23:27,049 --> 00:23:38,899
from harvest Wow just a little bit

563
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:52,849
closer to the Sun okay we both had to

564
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:54,200
think about that yeah because since Mike

565
00:23:52,849 --> 00:23:55,879
was talking for a second I got a chance

566
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:57,740
to write this down if you need to make a

567
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:59,540
tea get yourself a five gallon bucket

568
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:00,920
get a clean bucket go to Lowe's pay a

569
00:23:59,539 --> 00:24:03,680
couple bucks get a clean bucket

570
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:05,630
I'll get yourself go to the hydro store

571
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:07,880
or the fish store to get some an air

572
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:09,860
pump that pumps out quite a bit Eric get

573
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:11,570
yourself one of those air stones put the

574
00:24:09,859 --> 00:24:14,389
air stone in the bucket where fill the

575
00:24:11,569 --> 00:24:15,559
bucket with water if you can't put the

576
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:17,240
air stone in there and get that air

577
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:19,099
stone pumping that water with a lot of

578
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:20,660
oxygen for 24 hours before you do

579
00:24:19,099 --> 00:24:22,399
anything your goal here is to get the

580
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:24,140
chlorine out of that water that's what

581
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,630
you're trying to do so bubble that get

582
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:28,940
the chlorine out the next day add some

583
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:31,430
worm castings add some alfalfa sprouts

584
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:34,250
add some kelp meal and add a little tiny

585
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:37,490
bit of molasses let that bubble for like

586
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:41,630
24 hours it's gonna get foamy expected

587
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:43,339
to get foamy it will foam up like a beer

588
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:45,620
and go everywhere if you're not careful

589
00:24:43,339 --> 00:24:47,269
it may or may not it depends on your

590
00:24:45,619 --> 00:24:48,979
witch's brew the proteins in the fish

591
00:24:47,269 --> 00:24:52,759
Hydra slates I didn't write fish I dress

592
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:54,529
fish I drew the smell

593
00:24:52,759 --> 00:24:56,299
this carpet one time so just fair

594
00:24:54,529 --> 00:24:57,619
warning listeners be careful what your

595
00:24:56,299 --> 00:24:59,149
witch's brew does the first time you

596
00:24:57,619 --> 00:25:02,019
make it because sometimes it foams up

597
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:04,190
like a song yes what I would recommend

598
00:25:02,019 --> 00:25:05,269
this will make enough so if you use this

599
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:07,789
five-gallon bucket you could probably

600
00:25:05,269 --> 00:25:08,599
cut this in half or if you're going

601
00:25:07,789 --> 00:25:10,039
outdoor you just put a little

602
00:25:08,599 --> 00:25:11,599
five-gallon bucket on there if you want

603
00:25:10,039 --> 00:25:15,710
to but it's getting toward the end of

604
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:16,549
the season keep that in mind take your

605
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:18,079
five-gallon bucket

606
00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:19,069
pour the book put the bubble in fill it

607
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:20,269
with water put the bubble in there

608
00:25:19,069 --> 00:25:22,009
bubble it long enough to get the

609
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:24,680
chlorine off then you pour in the fish

610
00:25:22,009 --> 00:25:25,910
Hydra sleights worm castings alfalfa

611
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:27,080
sprouts is that the right one is that

612
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:29,060
what I want to use I think that's what

613
00:25:27,079 --> 00:25:30,470
you want kelp meal and molasses pour

614
00:25:29,059 --> 00:25:31,579
those things in there there are more

615
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:32,809
things that you could use you can use

616
00:25:31,579 --> 00:25:34,490
crap meal you can bone

617
00:25:32,809 --> 00:25:36,230
use bone meal you can use fish meal if

618
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:38,390
you want to those things are not all

619
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:40,160
necessary put that in there let that

620
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:41,840
[ __ ] stew around in that bubbles for

621
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:44,120
like 12 to 24 hours it's gonna make a

622
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:45,799
bunch of foam let's do it in the garage

623
00:25:44,119 --> 00:25:47,329
if you have to do it somewhere it's easy

624
00:25:45,799 --> 00:25:48,829
to clean up or you're not worried about

625
00:25:47,329 --> 00:25:51,439
a bunch of foam if it does not fall up

626
00:25:48,829 --> 00:25:54,259
that does not mean it's bad let it

627
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:57,650
bubble up then go outside and pour it on

628
00:25:54,259 --> 00:25:59,629
your plants not on the plants and water

629
00:25:57,650 --> 00:26:02,180
your plants with it don't go near the

630
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:03,440
stock go out because your roots that eat

631
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:05,090
the most and drink the most are the ones

632
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,650
that are on the outer perimeter of the

633
00:26:05,089 --> 00:26:07,970
plant not right there at the stock the

634
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:09,019
part of the stock is always gonna have

635
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:11,150
some moisture down there at the bottom

636
00:26:09,019 --> 00:26:12,319
go on the outer edge that's where your

637
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:14,600
growing roots are the plants are

638
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:16,369
reaching out for stuff so keep go out

639
00:26:14,599 --> 00:26:18,469
there a little bit so your best bet is

640
00:26:16,369 --> 00:26:20,089
to make a tea water with this tea and

641
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:22,130
then hopefully you'll see a little bit

642
00:26:20,089 --> 00:26:23,059
of boost in there the fish hydro slates

643
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:24,440
are gonna give you a little bit of

644
00:26:23,059 --> 00:26:26,809
nitrogen the worm castings are gonna

645
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:28,340
give you microbes and it's gonna help

646
00:26:26,809 --> 00:26:29,629
everything the worm castings will

647
00:26:28,339 --> 00:26:31,639
provide a little tiny bit of nitrogen

648
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:33,230
but they'll also speed everything up the

649
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:35,060
alfalfa meal is going to give you

650
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:37,309
nitrogen that's readily available to

651
00:26:35,059 --> 00:26:39,619
kelp meal I just think that that makes

652
00:26:37,309 --> 00:26:45,740
everything stink it makes it smell

653
00:26:39,619 --> 00:26:47,299
better it makes it taste better yeah the

654
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:48,950
ocean products are always gonna make

655
00:26:47,299 --> 00:26:51,470
your stuff taste better in my opinion

656
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:53,750
and then molasses molasses will actually

657
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:56,329
feed all of the worm casting microbes

658
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:58,490
and it will also feed your plants a

659
00:26:56,329 --> 00:26:59,750
little bit as well so that's what you

660
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:01,490
can do outdoors but also keep in mind

661
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:03,259
bro it's time to start flushing so

662
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:04,750
you're right at the end of your clock

663
00:27:03,259 --> 00:27:06,670
but and

664
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:08,380
get this question sooner and out to you

665
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:10,090
sooner I'm not blaming anything on Jesse

666
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:12,490
but man jesse was busier [ __ ] this year

667
00:27:10,089 --> 00:27:15,819
so we didn't do many episodes Jesse next

668
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:35,259
year record a whole season of outdoors

669
00:27:15,819 --> 00:27:37,059
get it once and do 11 minutes yes to our

670
00:27:35,259 --> 00:27:38,410

to me

680
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:56,859
it would be easiest if you initiate a

681
00:27:53,769 --> 00:27:58,990
conversation by sending me an email to

682
00:27:56,859 --> 00:28:00,519
grow from your heart at hotmail.com

683

00:28:00,519 --> 00:28:03,910
another social media platform keep it

685
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:05,139
going it's easiest just to keep one

686
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:06,910
conversation happening because if you

687
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:10,270
jump to another platform you're confused

688
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:11,920
but if you're new that's the best way to

689
00:28:10,269 --> 00:28:14,049
get in touch with me and I'll get your

690
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:14,890
questions on an upcoming episode I'm

691
00:28:14,049 --> 00:28:16,569
trying to get through the questions

692
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:17,650
quickly because I know some of the

693
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:19,329
questions are urgent because you got

694
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:21,370
plants growing or need [ __ ] to happen so

695
00:28:19,329 --> 00:28:23,679
I'm trying to get on it trying to do

696
00:28:21,369 --> 00:28:25,089
more episodes for you so I've got

697
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:29,259
another thing I want to read before I

698
00:28:25,089 --> 00:28:31,329
get to the basement and legislation

699
00:28:29,259 --> 00:28:32,470
question that I've got I saw something

700
00:28:31,329 --> 00:28:33,909
on Facebook the other day and I thought

701
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:36,130
it was very entertaining right after I

702
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:37,360
did an episode about trim machines on a

703
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:38,650
recent episode we talked about trim

704
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:40,419
machines and I kind of bashed the [ __ ]

705
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:41,830
out of them somebody said which trim

706
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:43,000
machine to buy and I said don't buy a

707
00:28:41,829 --> 00:28:45,339
bunch of [ __ ] scissors and get your

708
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:49,779
friends over basically that's really

709
00:28:45,339 --> 00:28:51,220
what I think you should do it's somebody

710
00:28:49,779 --> 00:28:53,639
on Facebook I don't know if he wants to

711
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:56,710
be named or not he's known as soda pop

712
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:58,270
he says upcoming crop Tober helpful

713
00:28:56,710 --> 00:29:00,340
hints and we call it crop Tober yes

714
00:28:58,269 --> 00:29:02,500
October is crop Tober in Colorado

715
00:29:00,339 --> 00:29:09,699
everybody needs a trimmer everyone get

716
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:10,950
some yeah every California migrant memes

717
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:14,710
[Music]

718
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:16,659
trimming rents are coming ah so helpful

719
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:18,460
crop tober or upcoming crop tober

720
00:29:16,659 --> 00:29:20,320
helpful hints and this dude says number

721
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:23,500
one if you want to process your trim

722
00:29:20,319 --> 00:29:26,230
into quality Metz please do not use a

723
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:29,859
machine trimmer oils from machine and

724
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:31,808
the beaten trim lead to unsightly slabs

725
00:29:29,859 --> 00:29:34,269
so he's saying that there's oils

726
00:29:31,808 --> 00:29:35,889
actually in the trim machine on the

727
00:29:34,269 --> 00:29:37,179
blades of the trim machine on the metal

728
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:44,440
parts of the trim machine that shit's

729
00:29:37,179 --> 00:29:47,019
got to be lower those oils will end up

730
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:48,399
on your trim and and that beaten up trim

731
00:29:47,019 --> 00:29:51,730
like I said before it turns into

732
00:29:48,398 --> 00:29:53,558
basically mulch and that when the trim

733
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:54,819
is cut into so many pieces it's um when

734
00:29:53,558 --> 00:29:56,408
you cut up with scissors you cut it one

735
00:29:54,819 --> 00:30:06,369
time you cut that leaf off the plant

736
00:29:56,409 --> 00:30:08,500
maybe three or four I mean just mulching

737
00:30:06,369 --> 00:30:10,479
all your little pieces and that leaves

738
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:12,759
that many spots for moisture that much

739
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,558
surface area for moisture and that many

740
00:30:12,759 --> 00:30:16,390
spots for chlorophyll to come out you

741
00:30:14,558 --> 00:30:23,349
want you want to hit it with scissors

742
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:24,940
but it's not good it does juice it and

743
00:30:23,349 --> 00:30:26,558
then that juice ends up in your hash and

744
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:28,509
it tastes like [ __ ] and looks like [ __ ]

745
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:30,519
and then number two he says if you plan

746
00:30:28,509 --> 00:30:33,990
to process the nug please flush

747
00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:35,379
correctly and no spring or pesticides

748
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:38,440
whatsoever

749
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:41,860
these chemicals and nutrients tend to

750
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:44,919
leach into concentration and lead to

751
00:30:41,859 --> 00:30:48,908
unsightly slabs so he's saying flush

752
00:30:44,919 --> 00:30:52,179
properly flush correctly and there's a

753
00:30:48,909 --> 00:30:55,120
lot yes

754
00:30:52,179 --> 00:30:57,159
if you've sprayed your plants with just

755
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:59,859
about anything while they're in flower

756
00:30:57,159 --> 00:31:02,020
and it's processed into a concentrate

757
00:30:59,859 --> 00:31:04,389
that concentrates not gonna pass testing

758
00:31:02,019 --> 00:31:05,859
and make it onto the market most of the

759
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:07,330
people he's talking about I think he's

760
00:31:05,859 --> 00:31:10,379
talking about these black market street

761
00:31:07,329 --> 00:31:10,379
growers well yeah

762
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:18,529
I had no spring but absolutely if you're

763
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:19,759
gonna make concentrates think about this

764
00:31:18,529 --> 00:31:22,579
you guys you're gonna spray some [ __ ]

765
00:31:19,759 --> 00:31:24,859
okay you're spraying what does everybody

766
00:31:22,579 --> 00:31:26,299
use in like a Xamax is probably one of

767
00:31:24,859 --> 00:31:28,279
the most popular things when I worked in

768
00:31:26,299 --> 00:31:29,960
the dispensary our area every I've

769
00:31:28,279 --> 00:31:31,819
toured a couple of dispensaries and all

770
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:33,620
of them have a Xamax on the shelf that's

771
00:31:31,819 --> 00:31:34,639
what like the most common spray and

772
00:31:33,619 --> 00:31:37,250
we're gonna talk about something that

773
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:39,140
has a max is gonna do in a future

774
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:42,559
episode that I've got written down but

775
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:44,300
everyone's got the azza max I'm sure now

776
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:46,009
you spray it's kind of waxy it's gonna

777
00:31:44,299 --> 00:31:47,240
orally you spray as Max under your

778
00:31:46,009 --> 00:31:49,400
plants it like probably I don't know

779
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:50,900
week two week three that shits in the

780
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:53,120
middle of your buds as your bud grows

781
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:54,680
around it that waxy oily concentration

782
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:56,750
is still there and the buds just grow

783
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:59,900
around it and it's still inside there

784
00:31:56,750 --> 00:32:01,009
then the buds dry and he grind it up and

785
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:03,920
you run it through an extraction machine

786
00:32:01,009 --> 00:32:06,230
to wash it off you can actually see that

787
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:08,029
little layer of a Xamax right on top of

788
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:09,529
your concentrate sometimes I've seen it

789
00:32:08,029 --> 00:32:11,930
I've seen it float to the top I have

790
00:32:09,529 --> 00:32:14,389
[ __ ] tasted it like I've been in

791

rooms ative jives Bri I've I didn't know

792
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:17,030
any better when I started growing but

793
00:32:15,589 --> 00:32:18,199
remember back in the day when we did not

794
00:32:17,029 --> 00:32:19,849
know any better he would spray whatever

795
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:22,490

797
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:28,269

798
00:32:24,289 --> 00:32:28,269
immediate blindness if you touch it like

799
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,048
[Music]

800
00:32:40,509 --> 00:32:50,230
organic or the natural people like to

801
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:53,060
use at one point or another it's

802
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:55,279
everybody that the consumes cannabis at

803
00:32:53,059 --> 00:32:57,049
one point or another has hit a bowl and

804
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:59,420
all they tasted for the next hour was

805
00:32:57,049 --> 00:33:02,720
neem they might not have known where it

806
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:04,400
was but it's I mean that's incredibly

807
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:07,160
common just quit spraying [ __ ] that's a

and don't spray [ __ ] on your plants

811
00:33:12,079 --> 00:33:14,449
if you're trying to make concentrates

812
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:16,339
out of it you know that's a general rule

813
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:17,600
if your turn if you're going to use if

814
00:33:16,339 --> 00:33:20,179
you're making medicine or something you

815
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:22,159
want other people to consume flush

816
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:24,590
properly and don't spray it on your

817
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:26,840
plants number three take proper care of

818
00:33:24,589 --> 00:33:27,750
nug and trim that would be you for use

819
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:30,269
in extract

820
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:31,859
proper cure care cleaning and basic

821
00:33:30,269 --> 00:33:34,619
hygiene of the plant and material are

822
00:33:31,859 --> 00:33:36,479
critical for quality meds you guys one

823
00:33:34,619 --> 00:33:39,000
thing that I don't see enough of is

824
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:41,220
people wearing nitrile or rubber gloves

825
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:44,190
where are some gloves you don't want all

826
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:45,750
your finger skin in my concentrates or

827
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:47,880
on my flowers when you're trimming that

828
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:49,349
[ __ ] is sticky where are some gloves

829
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:51,090
please I don't want to smoke your skin

830
00:33:49,349 --> 00:33:53,279
flakes we're bros we're friends I love

831
00:33:51,089 --> 00:33:57,029
you I do not want to smoke your [ __ ]

832
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:58,798
hands also take care of stuff just cuz

833
00:33:57,029 --> 00:34:00,538
it's gonna get turned into hash doesn't

834
00:33:58,798 --> 00:34:02,250
mean you can trim your trim your leaves

835
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:03,808
and do a tarp on the floor and have the

836
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:05,460
whole crew walk on them during trim time

837
00:34:03,808 --> 00:34:07,109
and then sweep them up and make hash I

838
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:08,699
don't know it's [ __ ] gross trim that

839
00:34:07,109 --> 00:34:10,858
into a container take care of it that's

840
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:12,689
somebody's medicine you may make edibles

841
00:34:10,858 --> 00:34:14,039
out of it think about like looking at

842
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:15,809
all as something that you're going to

843
00:34:14,039 --> 00:34:17,099
put into your mouth but if you're one of

844
00:34:15,809 --> 00:34:18,659
them dirty [ __ ] people to lesion off

845
00:34:17,099 --> 00:34:20,039
the floor look at it as something that a

846
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:22,340
princess has to put in their mouth

847
00:34:20,039 --> 00:34:26,250
because it's got to be clean products

848
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:29,039
also cure your [ __ ] you're gonna blast

849
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:30,809
it I understand live resin let's get it

850
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:33,918
off there was that weird thing at the

851
00:34:30,809 --> 00:34:37,079
beginning of the butane hash days where

852
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:38,638
you made BHO with this stuff you

853
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:40,500
couldn't use the stuff that was trashed

854
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:42,269
right I remember people saying some

855
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:44,010
crazy [ __ ] like oh that's moldy just

856
00:34:42,269 --> 00:34:48,898
blast the powdery mildew doesn't exist

857
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:51,750
anymore since we have pho right but if

858
00:34:48,898 --> 00:34:54,418
you want to make good concentrates you

859
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:56,699
really have to produce bud that's ready

860
00:34:54,418 --> 00:34:58,559
to go on a store shelf yes and then make

861
00:34:56,699 --> 00:35:01,108
concentrates from that out of that bomb

862
00:34:58,559 --> 00:35:03,210
and I see so many people that [ __ ] up

863
00:35:01,108 --> 00:35:05,130
that last step it's like buying a

864
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:07,769
Lamborghini and Wrekin it like in the

865
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:09,990
lot you're not even off the lot yet any

866
00:35:07,769 --> 00:35:11,039
record you spent nine weeks flowering

867
00:35:09,989 --> 00:35:13,309
and then you just spend a week

868
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:16,289
harvesting and I'm just gonna [ __ ] it up

869
00:35:13,309 --> 00:35:18,420
you can take the trash so once you flush

870
00:35:16,289 --> 00:35:21,000
that plant you can cut it down and knock

871
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:22,559
off most of the big leaves and if you

872
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,019
plan on blasting the entire plant

873
00:35:22,559 --> 00:35:26,429
hang it up let it excuse me a burp it up

874
00:35:25,019 --> 00:35:28,500
some dr. pepper hanging upside down let

875
00:35:26,429 --> 00:35:29,699
it dry and cure cut it off the sticks

876
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,960
take the sticks out of there and then

877
00:35:29,699 --> 00:35:33,149
you've pretty much got blasts of all

878
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:35,070
material you can't really [ __ ] that up

879
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:37,289
so just take care of it keep it clean

880
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:39,130
wear gloves you wouldn't believe some of

881
00:35:37,289 --> 00:35:43,659
the stuff that I have seen and heard

882
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:45,400
coming in from like grows coming into

883
00:35:43,659 --> 00:35:48,989
extraction labs people have found

884
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:52,119
cigarette butts scissors razor blades

885
00:35:48,989 --> 00:35:54,459
forks from launch like all kinds of [ __ ]

886
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:56,319
in the material it was so bad

887
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:58,210
two years ago when we started

888
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:01,150
implementing lab testing that a number

889
00:35:58,210 --> 00:36:03,039
of extract companies just went out and

890
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:04,510
bought the hundred thousand or two

891
00:36:03,039 --> 00:36:07,300
hundred to three hundred thousand pieces

892
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:10,180
of equipment so that they could in-house

893
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:11,289
lab test [ __ ] as it came in because it

894
00:36:10,179 --> 00:36:13,119
was some of the stuff they were

895
00:36:11,289 --> 00:36:16,000
processing was so nasty

896
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:18,099
it was [ __ ] up their machines and so

897
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,079
they processed the dude for the first

898
00:36:18,099 --> 00:36:22,179
guy or the material for the first guy in

899
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:24,909
the morning it dirties up the machine

900
00:36:22,179 --> 00:36:27,069
everybody else that gets run that day is

901
00:36:24,909 --> 00:36:30,170
taking home a piece of that trash that

902
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:33,260
came through in just a little residual

903
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:33,260
[Music]

904
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:40,539
that's disgusting thinking about

905
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:42,160
somebody another farm running some stuff

906
00:36:40,539 --> 00:36:43,929
and this is Mad Max in there then my

907
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:45,489
farm run on this clean organic product

908
00:36:43,929 --> 00:36:49,389
in there and just mixing it up and now

909
00:36:45,489 --> 00:36:51,819
I've got your as a max residuals when I

910
00:36:49,389 --> 00:36:54,339
see stuff like black market stuff

911
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:56,230
weather like just got some awesome SAP

912
00:36:54,340 --> 00:37:00,160
and you look at it and it's black and

913
00:36:56,230 --> 00:37:02,949
soupy and it god only knows what's in it

914
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:05,289
I mean we're so lucky here that we've

915
00:37:02,949 --> 00:37:07,779
got lab tested so let some regulation

916
00:37:05,289 --> 00:37:09,639
that we can get away from that I wish it

917
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:11,890
was more available to the recreational

918
00:37:09,639 --> 00:37:13,989
grower lab testing isn't as available

919
00:37:11,889 --> 00:37:18,849
but in the future it will be yep that's

920
00:37:13,989 --> 00:37:21,250
one of the things that we're alright so

921
00:37:18,849 --> 00:37:22,719
perfect timing we're thirty six minutes

922
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:25,780
into this podcast and we have not gotten

923
00:37:22,719 --> 00:37:27,669
to the main topic so shout out to soda

924
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:30,250
pop for the cool Facebook post at the

925
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:33,369
end heat hashtag that the Machine knows

926
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:34,690
the truth so supports my claims that RIM

927
00:37:33,369 --> 00:37:36,730
machines suck don't use a trim machine

928
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:38,950
take care of your plants and take care

929
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:40,809
of the trim and ugh if you plan to make

930
00:37:38,949 --> 00:37:42,159
extract she's good luck out there just

931
00:37:40,809 --> 00:37:44,949
dropped over season I hope your plants

932
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:46,409
made it I hope none of them got stolen

933
00:37:44,949 --> 00:37:47,659
[Music]

934
00:37:46,409 --> 00:37:49,730
yeah

935
00:37:47,659 --> 00:37:54,349
it's that time of year we call it crops

936
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:57,740
over we also call it holy season right

937
00:37:54,349 --> 00:38:01,839
now yeah Ripper season I see social

938
00:37:57,739 --> 00:38:05,000
media stuff already well right now it's

939
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:06,769
it's getting close to harvest if you're

940
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:14,150
growing outdoors in any way shape or

941
00:38:06,769 --> 00:38:18,920
form it's smelling freaking out just

942
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:23,329
take some deep breaths relax is not the

943
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:24,500
worst thing part of it for you I hope

944
00:38:23,329 --> 00:38:25,909
they were a cool thief and if you had

945
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:29,449
four plants I hope they only took one

946
00:38:25,909 --> 00:38:31,940
it's it's just unfortunate that we still

947
00:38:29,449 --> 00:38:33,409
have to deal with this yes all right so

948
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:34,610
I wish we could just go outside nobody

949
00:38:33,409 --> 00:38:36,139
comes to steal the tomatoes in the

950
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:37,309
backyard why are they stealing cannabis

951
00:38:36,139 --> 00:38:39,980
with cannabis is somebody's cancer

952
00:38:37,309 --> 00:38:42,889
medicine you know shitty it's just worth

953
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:50,960
so much in certain places it's I mean

954
00:38:42,889 --> 00:38:53,089
it's like let's jump into this email

955
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:55,579
that I got this email this dude signed

956
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:57,740
his name dabbe Smith's and he says he

957
00:38:55,579 --> 00:39:00,559
was up Rasta huge fan of the podcast as

958
00:38:57,739 --> 00:39:02,479
I've said before he said I had a few

959
00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:04,880
questions I thought could be a podcast

960
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:06,679
I'm in Michigan and we just passed three

961
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:09,380
bills pushing us into a seed to sale

962
00:39:06,679 --> 00:39:10,819
system based on Colorado system I'm

963
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:12,800
gonna quickly talk about that in

964
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:15,350
Colorado we have a seed to sale system

965
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:17,090
everything that is for sale recreational

966
00:39:15,349 --> 00:39:20,659
or medically in the state of Colorado

967
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:23,180
has been grown from seed or a clone

968
00:39:20,659 --> 00:39:25,940

00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:36,559
everything that happens in there every

974
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:38,720
square [ __ ] inch of this facility is

975
00:39:36,559 --> 00:39:41,659
on camera they have it set up to where

976
00:39:38,719 --> 00:39:43,519
if you can be in that building and there

977
00:39:41,659 --> 00:39:45,109
is a spot where you're not on camera you

978
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:46,789
have to put another camera if you can

979
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:48,680
hide around this little partition or

980
00:39:46,789 --> 00:39:50,239
behind this door they want another

981
00:39:48,679 --> 00:39:52,759
camera in there so that you cannot hide

982
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:54,559
anywhere so everything that happens in

983
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:56,900
there is on camera which that's where

984
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:59,360
the seed part starts if you grow a seed

985
00:39:56,900 --> 00:40:00,250
it's on camera if you grow a clone it is

986
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:03,250
on camera it is

987
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:04,989
given an rfid tag we call those a med

988
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:07,210
tag you have to tag every single plan

989
00:40:04,989 --> 00:40:09,549
and put it into a system known as metric

990
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:10,960
then they are tagged they are accounted

991
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:13,450
for they're part of your plant count

992
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:15,400
that you're allowed to have when a

993
00:40:13,449 --> 00:40:16,989
regular walks in a room they've got a

994
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:19,150
tool they can just hold up and press the

995
00:40:16,989 --> 00:40:20,679
button and it tells them exactly how

996
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:23,440
many plants for in that room yes because

997
00:40:20,679 --> 00:40:25,440
of the RFID on those plant tags I mean

998
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:28,360
everything is tracked out ridiculously

999
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:30,309
ridiculously so as those plants grow

1000
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:31,990
there they are now clones in my computer

1001
00:40:30,309 --> 00:40:34,090
system if they when I put them into

1002
00:40:31,989 --> 00:40:36,279
bigger pots now they have to be clicked

1003
00:40:34,090 --> 00:40:38,500
into veg if I move them to another room

1004
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:40,240
they have to be marked in this little

1005
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:42,610
tab on the computer what room they move

1006
00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:44,589
into when I move them into flower I have

1007
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:46,300
to move them I'll have to change their

1008
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:48,190
room I have to change their status and I

1009
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:50,440
have to mark that all the tags are still

1010
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:52,809
the same numbers everything stays on

1011
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:54,820
camera when it's harvested all of the

1012
00:40:52,809 --> 00:40:57,250
trimmers are in a room guess what

1013
00:40:54,820 --> 00:41:00,100
they're all on camera everything is done

1014
00:40:57,250 --> 00:41:02,650
on camera it's trimmed the trim is kept

1015
00:41:00,099 --> 00:41:04,509
in one area the trash is weighed all of

1016
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:06,099
the trash is weighed before it's thrown

1017
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:07,900
away so that we know and everything is

1018
00:41:06,099 --> 00:41:09,699
weighed I cut down the plant put it on a

1019
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:12,099
scale hand it to the trimmers they

1020
00:41:09,699 --> 00:41:13,869
separate buds and sticks and trim we

1021
00:41:12,099 --> 00:41:15,130
weigh the buds we weigh the trim we

1022
00:41:13,869 --> 00:41:18,400
weigh the trash we throw the trash away

1023
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:20,110
the trash is documented in the marijuana

1024
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:22,480
Enforcement Division computer which is

1025
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:26,320
known as metric so everything is on

1026
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:28,780
camera it is put into specific weight

1027
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:30,580
packages the packages are documented in

1028
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:34,269
a computer with a tag number on it that

1029
00:41:30,579 --> 00:41:36,730
tag again has an RFID code on it then

1030
00:41:34,269 --> 00:41:39,759
they are put into what's called a

1031
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:41,500
manifest a transfer manifest then that

1032
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:44,320
transfer manifest has the vehicle

1033
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:46,599
operators name driver's license number

1034
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:48,519
license plate number vehicle make model

1035
00:41:46,599 --> 00:41:50,579
description then you have to type in the

1036
00:41:48,519 --> 00:41:53,199
exact route that you are traveling

1037
00:41:50,579 --> 00:41:55,119
leaving this street turning left on this

1038
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:56,769
street right onto this street to the

1039
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:59,019
destination then once you get there it

1040
00:41:56,769 --> 00:42:00,730
is unpacked and checked on camera by the

1041
00:41:59,019 --> 00:42:03,039
dispensary that it's taken to then it's

1042
00:42:00,730 --> 00:42:04,719
put on a shelf all under camera then it

1043
00:42:03,039 --> 00:42:08,110
is sold all under this date this

1044
00:42:04,719 --> 00:42:10,569
everything is recorded in covered and

1045
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:13,180
there's absolutely no

1046
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:15,490
the only time that anything could happen

1047
00:42:13,179 --> 00:42:17,259
is in a vehicle but if you're following

1048
00:42:15,489 --> 00:42:18,939
marijuana Enforcement Division rules

1049
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:21,670
every package that leaves the grow

1050
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:24,760
facility is vacuum sealed in a vacuum

1051
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:26,139
bag with a marijuana Enforcement

1052
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:28,090
Division sticker on it that has a

1053
00:42:26,139 --> 00:42:30,309
specific weight written on it with a

1054
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:32,620
stream name on it and then that is also

1055
00:42:30,309 --> 00:42:35,469
on a paper that matches that tag number

1056
00:42:32,619 --> 00:42:36,639
that has the course by checks I can't

1057
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:38,769
even tell you how many hundreds of

1058
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:42,219
shipments in my day and not one of them

1059
00:42:38,769 --> 00:42:43,539
was by anything right yeah well you can

1060
00:42:42,219 --> 00:42:44,709
if they're in those vacuum sealed bags

1061
00:42:43,539 --> 00:42:51,550
and I open it in the car while I'm

1062
00:42:44,710 --> 00:43:09,940
driving there's no way that's not gonna

1063
00:42:51,550 --> 00:43:11,500
happen and it works actually it sounds

1064
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:13,599
stringent and it sounds ridiculous but

1065
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:15,010
when we have problems like we've

1066
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:16,599
recently talked about on the show

1067
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:18,160
there have been batches of concentrates

1068
00:43:16,599 --> 00:43:19,569
that have been made with flowers that

1069
00:43:18,159 --> 00:43:22,449
were sprayed with pesticides that were

1070
00:43:19,570 --> 00:43:25,000
not allowed since each plant was tracked

1071
00:43:22,449 --> 00:43:26,710
and when we apply a pesticide we write

1072
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:29,050
down every tag number that that

1073
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:32,470
pesticide is applied to or a foliar

1074
00:43:29,050 --> 00:43:34,960
spray or any type of everything that

1075
00:43:32,469 --> 00:43:37,689
happens so they could see that

1076
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:39,699
everything grown in facility number four

1077
00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:42,220
zero three extracted by extraction

1078
00:43:39,699 --> 00:43:44,049
company four zero two and there's be

1079
00:43:42,219 --> 00:43:46,480
dashes at the end of those everything

1080
00:43:44,050 --> 00:43:48,610
from that batch was contaminated at

1081
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:50,800
plant tag number one thousand six five

1082
00:43:48,610 --> 00:43:53,110
five five through 1,000 the stages

1083
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:54,730
whatever release is a list retailers

1084
00:43:53,110 --> 00:43:57,550
check the serial numbers on their

1085
00:43:54,730 --> 00:43:59,199
product and you know instantly if you're

1086
00:43:57,550 --> 00:44:04,440
carrying some tainted product is

1087
00:43:59,199 --> 00:44:04,439
cannabis or hash or edibles or topical

1088
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:16,510
so it's absolutely helpful even though

1089
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:18,849
it seems really once it took me a couple

1090
00:44:16,510 --> 00:44:20,410
of months of working with but after like

1091
00:44:18,849 --> 00:44:21,639
a month or two of doing metric every

1092
00:44:20,409 --> 00:44:23,348
single day I was like

1093
00:44:21,639 --> 00:44:25,808
easy it's just what you do it becomes

1094
00:44:23,349 --> 00:44:27,970
part of your routine you just treat your

1095
00:44:25,809 --> 00:44:29,500
workday like chess moves yeah and as

1096
00:44:27,969 --> 00:44:32,288
soon as you accept that you're good to

1097
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:33,969
go I would make notes on a little piece

1098
00:44:32,289 --> 00:44:35,319
of paper of things that I needed to do

1099
00:44:33,969 --> 00:44:36,518
it metric as I did it and then I would

1100
00:44:35,318 --> 00:44:38,199
go to the office and just catch up

1101
00:44:36,518 --> 00:44:39,669
metric right before lunch and then go

1102
00:44:38,199 --> 00:44:41,379
back and catch up metric right before I

1103
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:42,849
leave at the end of the day or when it

1104
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:44,410
got down to cutting clones and doing

1105
00:44:42,849 --> 00:44:46,778
things that needed a lot of metric

1106
00:44:44,409 --> 00:44:48,518
attention I had a little cart I would

1107
00:44:46,778 --> 00:44:49,900
just take my macbook to work and sign

1108
00:44:48,518 --> 00:44:51,068
into metric right there and just do it

1109
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:53,619
on the card it was it was second nature

1110
00:44:51,068 --> 00:44:55,210
by the time I was done there so the CD

1111
00:44:53,619 --> 00:44:56,798
seal system is definitely helpful I

1112
00:44:55,210 --> 00:44:58,059
think it's gonna work I'm gonna continue

1113
00:44:56,798 --> 00:45:01,809
with the email because this is gonna be

1114
00:44:58,059 --> 00:45:04,210
a long damn podcast if I don't I said we

1115
00:45:01,809 --> 00:45:06,039
passed three bills pushing us into a CD

1116
00:45:04,210 --> 00:45:08,019
sales system based on Colorado system I

1117
00:45:06,039 --> 00:45:11,049
was wondering if you and white Mike

1118
00:45:08,018 --> 00:45:13,209
could touch on the subject like how do I

1119
00:45:11,048 --> 00:45:15,219
go about finding out information from

1120
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:17,380
the city about how many license

1121
00:45:15,219 --> 00:45:19,568
facilities they will allow and then he

1122
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:21,099
also says what's the biggest hurdle

1123
00:45:19,568 --> 00:45:22,719
going from a basement grow to a

1124
00:45:21,099 --> 00:45:25,000
warehouse which I think is more directed

1125
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:26,409
at me and he continues to say I know you

1126
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,909
have recently made the switch from soil

1127
00:45:26,409 --> 00:45:30,250
to cocoa and any advice on that

1128
00:45:27,909 --> 00:45:32,440
transition I am planning on running veg

1129
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:34,420
bloom and I'm already in a basement but

1130
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:36,608
do you add anything else to the wine as

1131
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:38,528
well what are some things you didn't

1132
00:45:36,608 --> 00:45:40,630
expect going to such a large scale and

1133
00:45:38,528 --> 00:45:43,210
any other advice you may think one would

1134
00:45:40,630 --> 00:45:44,858
need to know about taking a leap into

1135
00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:46,778
the big leagues thanks again for such a

1136
00:45:44,858 --> 00:45:51,489
great podcast I hope you can answer some

1137
00:45:46,778 --> 00:45:53,048
questions for me and other other

1138
00:45:51,489 --> 00:45:54,909
questions others I'm not sure how you

1139
00:45:53,048 --> 00:45:57,099
wanted it in that but yes will answer

1140
00:45:54,909 --> 00:45:58,598
your question bro all that might go with

1141
00:45:57,099 --> 00:46:11,798
the first part I've got a lot of stuff

1142
00:45:58,599 --> 00:46:12,880
to say first of all lawyer up make sure

1143
00:46:11,798 --> 00:46:16,449
they're all [ __ ] keep an eye on each

1144
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:18,460
other that's my first that should really

1145
00:46:16,449 --> 00:46:20,789
be like the first half of like every

1146
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:23,460
business school 101 class

1147
00:46:20,789 --> 00:46:24,960
yes yeah lawyer and don't want to be too

1148
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:26,670
good of friends make hopefully your

1149
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:27,809
lawyer don't seem like they like each

1150
00:46:26,670 --> 00:46:31,789
other because then they can't team up on

1151
00:46:27,809 --> 00:46:33,659
you just keep them watching each other I

1152
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:36,420
think he's stealing from me just keep

1153
00:46:33,659 --> 00:46:38,969
him like that people watch it so Mike

1154
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:41,039
the first question how do we go about

1155
00:46:38,969 --> 00:46:43,019
finding out information from the cities

1156
00:46:41,039 --> 00:46:47,550
how many licensed facilities they will

1157
00:46:43,019 --> 00:46:49,710
allow before we before we hit record we

1158
00:46:47,550 --> 00:46:51,210
I jumped online we jumped online and

1159
00:46:49,710 --> 00:46:56,490
checked out some of the stuff about your

1160
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:59,070
law in Michigan local control is part of

1161
00:46:56,489 --> 00:47:00,869
it and so and this is from the cannabis

1162
00:46:59,070 --> 00:47:04,430
surprise-surprise reported here in

1163
00:47:00,869 --> 00:47:07,139
Colorado but according to the cannabis

1164
00:47:04,429 --> 00:47:10,679
the local control part in Michigan's law

1165
00:47:07,139 --> 00:47:16,109
is growers processors shippers testing

1166
00:47:10,679 --> 00:47:18,449
facilities and just dispensaries could

1167
00:47:16,110 --> 00:47:20,880
not obtain a state license unless their

1168
00:47:18,449 --> 00:47:23,789
local government adopts an authorizing

1169
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:25,710
ordinance municipalities could cap the

1170
00:47:23,789 --> 00:47:27,630
number of licenses within their borders

1171
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:30,150
and assess no more than a five thousand

1172
00:47:27,630 --> 00:47:31,860
dollar fee per license a state board

1173
00:47:30,150 --> 00:47:33,660
would charge application and renewal

1174
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:35,099
fees to cover costs including for

1175
00:47:33,659 --> 00:47:37,349
substance abuse programs in law

1176
00:47:35,099 --> 00:47:40,170
enforcement so basically what that means

1177
00:47:37,349 --> 00:47:42,269
is you're gonna need two licenses to

1178
00:47:40,170 --> 00:47:43,829
open any sort of marijuana business in

1179
00:47:42,269 --> 00:47:45,539
Michigan and now we're talking about

1180
00:47:43,829 --> 00:47:47,519
medical marijuana businesses here

1181
00:47:45,539 --> 00:47:52,829
recreational is not quite legal in

1182
00:47:47,519 --> 00:47:55,590
Michigan yet I don't think so if your

1183
00:47:52,829 --> 00:47:57,869
local area does not create some sort of

1184
00:47:55,590 --> 00:47:59,789
licensing process for these businesses

1185
00:47:57,869 --> 00:48:03,750
you can't get a state license to operate

1186
00:47:59,789 --> 00:48:07,529
in that area so how do you find out what

1187
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:10,650
those rules are in your area the first

1188
00:48:07,530 --> 00:48:14,700
step is head to your local Planning and

1189
00:48:10,650 --> 00:48:18,300
Zoning hop online spend a few seconds

1190
00:48:14,699 --> 00:48:20,779
with google figure out where you're

1191
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:22,890
planning the zoning department is and

1192
00:48:20,780 --> 00:48:25,340
while you're there you can want to look

1193
00:48:22,889 --> 00:48:28,049
up city council or county commissioner

1194
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:30,780
whatever sort of governing body decides

1195
00:48:28,050 --> 00:48:33,060
the land use rules

1196
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:36,150
for your area for example here in Pueblo

1197
00:48:33,059 --> 00:48:38,070
Colorado in the city we have a City

1198
00:48:36,150 --> 00:48:40,410
Council who makes those decisions and

1199
00:48:38,070 --> 00:48:42,420
then in the county of Pueblo we have a

1200
00:48:40,409 --> 00:48:44,879
Board of County Commissioners these

1201
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:46,650
people are totally separate and have

1202
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:48,090
totally different rules for marijuana

1203
00:48:46,650 --> 00:48:50,610
businesses because they're totally

1204
00:48:48,090 --> 00:48:52,920
separate governmental entities I assume

1205
00:48:50,610 --> 00:48:54,440
it's very similar in Michigan so first

1206
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:57,900
step is figure out which mint

1207
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:59,309
municipality city county whatever you

1208
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:02,849
want to have your marijuana businesses

1209
00:48:59,309 --> 00:49:06,389
in head down to planning a zoning or

1210
00:49:02,849 --> 00:49:08,309
City Council or whatever and ask is what

1211
00:49:06,389 --> 00:49:12,599
is your first step and because this is

1212
00:49:08,309 --> 00:49:14,250
brand new you're likely to get to be met

1213
00:49:12,599 --> 00:49:16,769
with a confused look which means you've

1214
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:20,190
got some work ahead of you if you're

1215
00:49:16,769 --> 00:49:22,409
lucky the area you're in has favorable

1216
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:26,010
government officials who saw this coming

1217
00:49:22,409 --> 00:49:31,109
and have already crafted some sort of

1218
00:49:26,010 --> 00:49:33,000
land-use code specifying which zoning

1219
00:49:31,110 --> 00:49:36,720
designations the property for these

1220
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:38,969
businesses have to carry distances from

1221
00:49:36,719 --> 00:49:41,969
schools libraries churches those kinds

1222
00:49:38,969 --> 00:49:44,009
of rules if they haven't gotten that far

1223
00:49:41,969 --> 00:49:46,019
yet you're looking at a year or more of

1224
00:49:44,010 --> 00:49:48,810
public hearings while these rules get

1225
00:49:46,019 --> 00:49:51,690
hashed out so like I said you've got

1226
00:49:48,809 --> 00:49:53,969
some work ahead of you this is where I

1227
00:49:51,690 --> 00:49:55,740
sort of got my activist credentials in

1228
00:49:53,969 --> 00:50:00,089
pueblo was helping Club low do all of

1229
00:49:55,739 --> 00:50:02,609
this so when you've checked with

1230
00:50:00,090 --> 00:50:04,890
Planning and Zoning to see a if your

1231
00:50:02,610 --> 00:50:07,170
area has these rules yet and if not how

1232
00:50:04,889 --> 00:50:08,730
they're being created the next thing to

1233
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:12,500
do is get yourself involved in that

1234
00:50:08,730 --> 00:50:14,730
conversation it's really easy to do

1235
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:17,969
especially as these rules are being

1236
00:50:14,730 --> 00:50:19,769
crafted whatever governmental agencies

1237
00:50:17,969 --> 00:50:21,629
crafting this rules will take a lot of

1238
00:50:19,769 --> 00:50:23,699
public comment so you get the

1239
00:50:21,630 --> 00:50:26,010
community's input how far they want them

1240
00:50:23,699 --> 00:50:29,009
from schools how high the licensing fees

1241
00:50:26,010 --> 00:50:30,660
should be if they want to add any sort

1242
00:50:29,010 --> 00:50:32,760
of other rules and regulations for

1243
00:50:30,659 --> 00:50:34,589
example there's an area in Colorado that

1244
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:37,350
requires marijuana businesses to be a

1245
00:50:34,590 --> 00:50:39,150
hundred percent energy neutral which

1246
00:50:37,349 --> 00:50:41,940
means they can't consume electricity

1247
00:50:39,150 --> 00:50:43,380
they don't also generate wrap your head

1248
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:45,200
around that one in a County that doesn't

1249
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:47,820
allow

1250
00:50:45,199 --> 00:50:50,129
but get involved with these in this

1251
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:55,800
conversation now and that way you can

1252
00:50:50,130 --> 00:51:00,869
help nudge or guide the regulator's as

1253
00:50:55,800 --> 00:51:02,550
they write the rules for your area if

1254
00:51:00,869 --> 00:51:06,599
you're smart you'll help them steer

1255
00:51:02,550 --> 00:51:08,550
clear of business number caps and things

1256
00:51:06,599 --> 00:51:10,380
like that that's really really really

1257
00:51:08,550 --> 00:51:12,600
bad for business it just creates

1258
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:15,630
monopolies right it immediately creates

1259
00:51:12,599 --> 00:51:18,269
a monopoly it forces the local

1260
00:51:15,630 --> 00:51:21,450
municipality to do a bunch of obnoxious

1261
00:51:18,269 --> 00:51:23,039
things like having a license Lottery and

1262
00:51:21,449 --> 00:51:25,619
some sort of review process for

1263
00:51:23,039 --> 00:51:29,190
applicants that's additionally

1264
00:51:25,619 --> 00:51:31,920
unnecessary I mean it creates a real

1265
00:51:29,190 --> 00:51:34,409
legislative and impractical nightmare

1266
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:36,930
for though the government agency trying

1267
00:51:34,409 --> 00:51:39,359
to do it and yet in Colorado they

1268
00:51:36,929 --> 00:51:41,969
continue to do it all over and over and

1269
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:45,539
over again but just get involved with

1270
00:51:41,969 --> 00:51:48,959
this conversation now and with in all

1271
00:51:45,539 --> 00:51:51,179
likelihood you'll be able to steer

1272
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:53,340
whatever local government agency that's

1273
00:51:51,179 --> 00:51:55,559
writing these rules into crafting smart

1274
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:57,750
rules for your agencies so that you're

1275
00:51:55,559 --> 00:51:59,309
not looking at huge licensing fees I

1276
00:51:57,750 --> 00:52:01,010
like that they have a cap in the state

1277
00:51:59,309 --> 00:52:04,049
rules at five grand

1278
00:52:01,010 --> 00:52:06,750
I've seen it as high as 50 here in

1279
00:52:04,050 --> 00:52:09,360
counties and cities this state only

1280
00:52:06,750 --> 00:52:11,010
charges five or seven or ten depending

1281
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:12,630
on the size of your license but I've

1282
00:52:11,010 --> 00:52:16,020
seen individual counties charge much

1283
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:18,660
much more than that so he's gonna need a

1284
00:52:16,019 --> 00:52:21,269
ton of money a lawyer an accountant no

1285
00:52:18,659 --> 00:52:23,460
he said Planning and Zoning and City

1286
00:52:21,269 --> 00:52:25,829
Council he also joined forces with his

1287
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:28,139
local marijuana activist groups that

1288
00:52:25,829 --> 00:52:29,940
that depends on the climate in your area

1289
00:52:28,139 --> 00:52:31,889
if you go down to planning and zoning

1290
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:33,990
and are greeted by a really friendly

1291
00:52:31,889 --> 00:52:36,179
person who hands you a printout of the

1292
00:52:33,989 --> 00:52:37,259
rules they've already crafted and all

1293
00:52:36,179 --> 00:52:38,819
you have to do is fill out the

1294
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:40,440
application and find a piece of property

1295
00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:43,410
that's zoned appropriately and get a

1296
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:46,110
rental agreement well Congrats bro you

1297
00:52:43,409 --> 00:52:47,819
live in a really enlightened area but

1298
00:52:46,110 --> 00:52:51,240
what's likely to happen is you're gonna

1299
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:53,309
be met with a confused look and they're

1300
00:52:51,239 --> 00:52:56,909
only gonna just be creating these rules

1301
00:52:53,309 --> 00:52:57,838
now and so if that's the case your best

1302
00:52:56,909 --> 00:53:02,068
bet is to

1303
00:52:57,838 --> 00:53:04,048
start attending County meetings zoning

1304
00:53:02,068 --> 00:53:06,900
meetings just watching how those

1305
00:53:04,048 --> 00:53:08,188
meetings take place I'm getting a feel

1306
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:09,389
for the people in charge of those

1307
00:53:08,188 --> 00:53:11,009
meetings who's on your City Council

1308
00:53:09,389 --> 00:53:13,318
who's on your Board of County

1309
00:53:11,009 --> 00:53:16,739
Commissioners or your Zoning Board what

1310
00:53:13,318 --> 00:53:18,538
if they like and dislike and I basically

1311
00:53:16,739 --> 00:53:21,958
it just takes a lot of sitting and

1312
00:53:18,539 --> 00:53:25,319
watching I mean watching laws get made

1313
00:53:21,958 --> 00:53:27,179
is incredibly boring but they're

1314
00:53:25,318 --> 00:53:30,358
legalizing marijuana across the country

1315
00:53:27,179 --> 00:53:32,368
we have to write all those laws if you

1316
00:53:30,358 --> 00:53:33,989
don't want really really messed up laws

1317
00:53:32,369 --> 00:53:35,039
written by people who don't understand

1318
00:53:33,989 --> 00:53:38,009
what we're doing and what we're working

1319
00:53:35,039 --> 00:53:39,630
with stand back and wait for somebody

1320
00:53:38,009 --> 00:53:41,099
else to do it I mean some of the rules

1321
00:53:39,630 --> 00:53:44,068
that were proposed here in Colorado

1322
00:53:41,099 --> 00:53:46,349
during this process we're asinine and it

1323
00:53:44,068 --> 00:53:49,679
took a while for people like myself to

1324
00:53:46,349 --> 00:53:53,459
explain to legislators why it was

1325
00:53:49,679 --> 00:53:55,708
asinine because I face value a lot of

1326
00:53:53,458 --> 00:53:57,478
them seemed like a good idea but when he

1327
00:53:55,708 --> 00:53:59,478
take it into practice like the last

1328
00:53:57,478 --> 00:54:01,968
episode we talked about edibles labeling

1329
00:53:59,478 --> 00:54:04,858
they were ready to get rid of all drinks

1330
00:54:01,969 --> 00:54:06,568
just we'll get rid of them period it's

1331
00:54:04,858 --> 00:54:09,420
never been a problem anywhere but we're

1332
00:54:06,568 --> 00:54:13,228
gonna cut out a massive some majors

1333
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:14,489
edibles industry um just for no reason

1334
00:54:13,228 --> 00:54:16,588
at all or the people that are making

1335
00:54:14,489 --> 00:54:18,269
these rules are not consumers they are

1336
00:54:16,588 --> 00:54:19,828
not producers they're just people

1337
00:54:18,268 --> 00:54:21,389
they're a lot of times they don't know

1338
00:54:19,829 --> 00:54:23,160
anything about it their best their

1339
00:54:21,389 --> 00:54:24,978
background is in like finance and they

1340
00:54:23,159 --> 00:54:27,449
were a dentist for 20 years or some [ __ ]

1341
00:54:24,978 --> 00:54:31,259
they don't know anything about mass

1342
00:54:27,449 --> 00:54:32,818
production of cannabis retail rules what

1343
00:54:31,259 --> 00:54:37,228
those rules might be for alcohol and

1344
00:54:32,818 --> 00:54:39,298
tobacco retailers why little tweaks to

1345
00:54:37,228 --> 00:54:41,159
those rules are appropriate for cannabis

1346
00:54:39,298 --> 00:54:43,278
I mean getting them to understand all

1347
00:54:41,159 --> 00:54:45,978
that can be quite a bit of work

1348
00:54:43,278 --> 00:54:48,918
probably got some fear in them also well

1349
00:54:45,978 --> 00:54:50,568
yeah they you have to go into this

1350
00:54:48,918 --> 00:54:55,489
knowing that most of the people you talk

1351
00:54:50,568 --> 00:54:57,380
to were the hall monitor not to be a

1352
00:54:55,489 --> 00:54:59,269
dick about it but that's yeah when you

1353
00:54:57,380 --> 00:55:00,739
start going to city government meetings

1354
00:54:59,268 --> 00:55:03,588
you're like that's what happened to all

1355
00:55:00,739 --> 00:55:05,778
those people from high school they just

1356
00:55:03,588 --> 00:55:07,219
disappeared from my world after graduate

1357
00:55:05,778 --> 00:55:09,108
they've got jobs in city government

1358
00:55:07,219 --> 00:55:11,688
that's where they all went yeah they're

1359
00:55:09,108 --> 00:55:13,400
all Jeff went on tour all these people

1360
00:55:11,688 --> 00:55:14,958
got jobs at their local zoning

1361
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:17,119
department and have worked their way

1362
00:55:14,958 --> 00:55:19,698
through the ranks of city bureaucracy

1363
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:20,778
for 20 years those are the people you're

1364
00:55:19,699 --> 00:55:22,969
dealing with and they're not bad people

1365
00:55:20,778 --> 00:55:24,619
most of them are wonderful but they

1366
00:55:22,969 --> 00:55:26,659
don't really know anything about

1367
00:55:24,619 --> 00:55:28,039
marijuana they don't know why we consume

1368
00:55:26,659 --> 00:55:29,509
it they don't know why it's fun at

1369
00:55:28,039 --> 00:55:31,719
concerts they just know it gives them a

1370
00:55:29,509 --> 00:55:33,769
headache when they go see popular music

1371
00:55:31,719 --> 00:55:35,809
and that's really the extent of their

1372
00:55:33,768 --> 00:55:39,018
education so getting them to understand

1373
00:55:35,809 --> 00:55:41,209
that moving all marijuana production

1374
00:55:39,018 --> 00:55:44,538
indoors is incredibly bad for the

1375
00:55:41,208 --> 00:55:47,418
environment when especially when

1376
00:55:44,539 --> 00:55:52,189
cannabis can be grown so effectively

1377
00:55:47,418 --> 00:55:54,889
outdoors that conversation we fail that

1378
00:55:52,188 --> 00:55:56,658
having a lot of places in Colorado which

1379
00:55:54,889 --> 00:55:58,278
is why Pueblo County so popular with

1380
00:55:56,659 --> 00:56:00,829
production facilities right now we're

1381
00:55:58,278 --> 00:56:03,498
loaded one of the few places you can

1382
00:56:00,829 --> 00:56:05,809
grow outdoors and we're one of the few

1383
00:56:03,498 --> 00:56:07,428
places you can grow in greenhouses and

1384
00:56:05,809 --> 00:56:09,259
we're one of the few places we're laying

1385
00:56:07,429 --> 00:56:11,088
isn't ridiculously expensive I mean

1386
00:56:09,259 --> 00:56:14,478
we've got the trifecta down here that's

1387
00:56:11,088 --> 00:56:16,668
why we have so many and it's changing B

1388
00:56:14,478 --> 00:56:17,838
the whole landscape here you can tell

1389
00:56:16,668 --> 00:56:19,129
that there's some money here now we

1390
00:56:17,838 --> 00:56:20,179
didn't have any money here before and

1391
00:56:19,130 --> 00:56:23,900
you can tell that there's actually some

1392
00:56:20,179 --> 00:56:27,469
future for this place had our county

1393
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:30,499
commissioners followed suit with Denver

1394
00:56:27,469 --> 00:56:33,259
and Aurora and Boulder in Longmont in

1395
00:56:30,498 --> 00:56:36,458
Lakewood and band outdoor growing band

1396
00:56:33,259 --> 00:56:39,438
greenhouse growing pushed it all indoors

1397
00:56:36,458 --> 00:56:41,868
the economic recovery we have enjoyed

1398
00:56:39,438 --> 00:56:43,068
has been berry or would have been very

1399
00:56:41,869 --> 00:56:46,789
different

1400
00:56:43,068 --> 00:56:49,489
and so in Michigan I know you guys have

1401
00:56:46,789 --> 00:56:54,130
been taking economic hit after economic

1402
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:55,309
hit for the last my whole life sorry

1403
00:56:54,130 --> 00:56:59,490
[Music]

1404
00:56:55,309 --> 00:57:02,519
this can really be an economic engine

1405
00:56:59,489 --> 00:57:05,819
for for growth and prosperity and it's

1406
00:57:02,519 --> 00:57:09,059
not a tidal wave of money that's gonna

1407
00:57:05,820 --> 00:57:10,530
fix everything I watch the video on

1408
00:57:09,059 --> 00:57:12,960
Detroit not too long ago or people will

1409
00:57:10,530 --> 00:57:16,710
just assembling skyscrapers and selling

1410
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:19,470
parts of scrap I'm like like active

1411
00:57:16,710 --> 00:57:21,720
skyscrapers are old skyscrapers okay as

1412
00:57:19,469 --> 00:57:24,629
long as I still people in them the

1413
00:57:21,719 --> 00:57:26,730
amount of recession in Detroit is is

1414
00:57:24,630 --> 00:57:28,980
significantly different than what we see

1415
00:57:26,730 --> 00:57:30,690
here even it even though we've got the

1416
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:33,539
blow and Detroit have gone through

1417
00:57:30,690 --> 00:57:36,289
similar things the scale is very

1418
00:57:33,539 --> 00:57:36,289
different

1419
00:57:37,530 --> 00:57:44,250
in a state like Michigan marijuana

1420
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:46,650
really could be two or three or twenty

1421
00:57:44,250 --> 00:57:48,599
or thirty thousand jobs oh yeah it could

1422
00:57:46,650 --> 00:57:49,769
bring it back now these people aren't

1423
00:57:48,599 --> 00:57:52,409
all gonna be making seventy five

1424
00:57:49,769 --> 00:57:54,809
thousand a year a lot of them are gonna

1425
00:57:52,409 --> 00:57:59,549
be making ten fifteen our twelve fifteen

1426
00:57:54,809 --> 00:58:02,099
hour fourteen an hour but that's still

1427
00:57:59,550 --> 00:58:04,530
thousands of jobs you're still talking

1428
00:58:02,099 --> 00:58:07,110
about hundreds of millions of dollars

1429
00:58:04,530 --> 00:58:09,060
into improving properties and bringing

1430
00:58:07,110 --> 00:58:10,829
them up to code and when Jeff starts

1431
00:58:09,059 --> 00:58:12,599
talking about is what what do you need

1432
00:58:10,829 --> 00:58:15,389
to know going from greenhouse to

1433
00:58:12,599 --> 00:58:17,400
warehouse the improvements that are

1434
00:58:15,389 --> 00:58:19,859
required in a lot of the warehouses to

1435
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:21,690
get them up to where he's gonna get at

1436
00:58:19,860 --> 00:58:24,329
that costs a lot of money and that

1437
00:58:21,690 --> 00:58:27,720
improvement is massive for the area we

1438
00:58:24,329 --> 00:58:29,369
had a excuse me we needed to upgrade our

1439
00:58:27,719 --> 00:58:30,239
air flow system a little bit of green

1440
00:58:29,369 --> 00:58:31,920
and healthy and I was getting some

1441
00:58:30,239 --> 00:58:33,779
estimates we're trying to connect two

1442
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:34,980
rooms two sides of a building and just

1443
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:36,450
run it through one air conditioning

1444
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:38,880
thing and handle some humidity and some

1445
00:58:36,449 --> 00:58:40,739
air control through one thing probably

1446
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:43,110
six to eight thousand each side to make

1447
00:58:40,739 --> 00:58:45,929
that happen just for a small air

1448
00:58:43,110 --> 00:58:48,090
exchange setup it's going from the home

1449
00:58:45,929 --> 00:58:49,739
to the commercial that when he said

1450
00:58:48,090 --> 00:58:54,660
eight thousand each side I was like oh

1451
00:58:49,739 --> 00:58:58,259
this is gonna take a second just the

1452
00:58:54,659 --> 00:59:00,799
economic boom a state can feel if this

1453
00:58:58,260 --> 00:59:03,990
is done correctly if it's done smartly

1454
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:06,810
and and to have but have it done

1455
00:59:03,989 --> 00:59:09,679
correctly really takes people willing to

1456
00:59:06,809 --> 00:59:12,090
do the legwork to go to City Council

1457
00:59:09,679 --> 00:59:14,159
meetings to go to state legislature

1458
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:16,910
meetings and make sure that they don't

1459
00:59:14,159 --> 00:59:20,309
do thousand-foot from everywhere rules

1460
00:59:16,909 --> 00:59:23,129
I remember here in Pueblo the the first

1461
00:59:20,309 --> 00:59:25,199
proposal I saw for for buffer zones the

1462
00:59:23,130 --> 00:59:27,300
the distance your marijuana business has

1463
00:59:25,199 --> 00:59:29,460
to be from other stuff they're like 25

1464
00:59:27,300 --> 00:59:35,760
different businesses on their nursing

1465
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:40,050
homes it was a specific business name

1466
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:42,460
region specifically seek out adults with

1467
00:59:40,050 --> 00:59:46,599
developmental disabilities

1468
00:59:42,460 --> 00:59:49,210
um as employees oh yeah

1469
00:59:46,599 --> 00:59:50,800
that's that companies kind of niche is

1470
00:59:49,210 --> 00:59:55,380
giving that whole segment of the

1471
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:57,190
population a great job and our original

1472
00:59:55,380 --> 01:00:00,760
legislation had a thousand feet from

1473
00:59:57,190 --> 01:00:01,510
their property and then in the middle of

1474
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:03,970
all of this

1475
01:00:01,510 --> 01:00:06,310
Colorado redefined what a thousand feet

1476
01:00:03,969 --> 01:00:10,209
from a school meant they changed how its

1477
01:00:06,309 --> 01:00:12,969
measured halfway through the game and it

1478
01:00:10,210 --> 01:00:14,858
wasn't like feet 2 inches kind of

1479
01:00:12,969 --> 01:00:19,209
distance but it was what they call as

1480
01:00:14,858 --> 01:00:21,338
the crow flies versus walking and so

1481
01:00:19,210 --> 01:00:23,949
originally dispensary owners walk out

1482
01:00:21,338 --> 01:00:26,380
their front door and took the street on

1483
01:00:23,949 --> 01:00:29,019
foot version right to the nearest school

1484
01:00:26,380 --> 01:00:30,519
and then applied that way saying that

1485
01:00:29,019 --> 01:00:32,739
there were a thousand three hundred feet

1486
01:00:30,519 --> 01:00:35,320
from a school and then they changed the

1487
01:00:32,739 --> 01:00:37,868
rule to ask the clothed crow flies and

1488
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:41,320
it turns out the nearest pieces of their

1489
01:00:37,869 --> 01:00:44,349
property lines are only six hundred feet

1490
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:46,750
apart because of a mass that was the

1491
01:00:44,349 --> 01:00:50,550
only mass shutdown of business had in

1492
01:00:46,750 --> 01:00:54,550
Colorado is because that rule changed

1493
01:00:50,550 --> 01:00:56,050
and so I mean for you I wouldn't Jeff

1494
01:00:54,550 --> 01:00:58,210
first told me this was a question I was

1495
01:00:56,050 --> 01:01:00,990
like dude that's a whole podcast we

1496
01:00:58,210 --> 01:01:03,699
can't do that as part of a thing because

1497
01:01:00,989 --> 01:01:06,969
where your state is right now and

1498
01:01:03,699 --> 01:01:08,469
honestly this applies to like 14

1499
01:01:06,969 --> 01:01:10,629
different states across the country

1500
01:01:08,469 --> 01:01:13,209
depending on what happens in November's

1501
01:01:10,630 --> 01:01:14,470
election 14 different states will be

1502
01:01:13,210 --> 01:01:17,139
going through the process we're talking

1503
01:01:14,469 --> 01:01:19,719
about right now or are about to be

1504
01:01:17,139 --> 01:01:21,368
depending on how the election goes so a

1505
01:01:19,719 --> 01:01:23,529
lot of you need to start thinking about

1506
01:01:21,369 --> 01:01:27,579
this who makes these decisions in your

1507
01:01:23,530 --> 01:01:29,200
area what kind of process is that what

1508
01:01:27,579 --> 01:01:30,880
does it look like how do I get involved

1509
01:01:29,199 --> 01:01:32,529
in that if you don't make those

1510
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:34,838
decisions and start writing those rules

1511
01:01:32,530 --> 01:01:38,830
somebody will write them for you

1512
01:01:34,838 --> 01:01:40,779
and unfortunately for you and what this

1513
01:01:38,829 --> 01:01:45,069
wasn't as bad when Colorado was doing

1514
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:49,990
this the anti pop movement is very vocal

1515
01:01:45,070 --> 01:01:52,300
now it was just the DEA in the police

1516
01:01:49,989 --> 01:01:53,529
and law enforcement in the prisons and

1517
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:55,810
police unions

1518
01:01:53,530 --> 01:01:58,480
when Colorado was doing this now there

1519
01:01:55,809 --> 01:02:00,279
are parents groups were freaked out and

1520
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:02,019
when you get into this mainly you'll

1521
01:02:00,280 --> 01:02:03,220
find that the anti-pot groups are just

1522
01:02:02,019 --> 01:02:06,579
people who didn't have anything in their

1523
01:02:03,219 --> 01:02:08,769
world and needed us something in trying

1524
01:02:06,579 --> 01:02:10,480
to remind us all that in eighth grade we

1525
01:02:08,769 --> 01:02:16,349
learned that pot is bad has become their

1526
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:19,320
goal in life right and they're not

1527
01:02:16,349 --> 01:02:21,699
very good at research or arguments we

1528
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:24,350
just got a mailer or a flyer in the mail

1529
01:02:21,699 --> 01:02:28,500
[Music]

1530
01:02:24,349 --> 01:02:32,279
but the one thing they they really

1531
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:34,050
really are is vocal yes and when you do

1532
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:35,610
get involved in this process in your

1533
01:02:34,050 --> 01:02:37,980
area one of the first things you're

1534
01:02:35,610 --> 01:02:39,660
gonna realize is that the old dude who

1535
01:02:37,980 --> 01:02:41,840
shows up to every meeting and won't shut

1536
01:02:39,659 --> 01:02:43,920
up about whatever their topic is

1537
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:45,840
everybody that's involved in student

1538
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:48,000
government knows that [ __ ] topic

1539
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:49,650
intimately they know every in and out of

1540
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:52,380
it and they're sick of hearing about it

1541
01:02:49,650 --> 01:02:54,450
for one reason because that dude shows

1542
01:02:52,380 --> 01:02:56,400
up and makes a lot of noise and that's

1543
01:02:54,449 --> 01:03:00,179
what the anti pop people do they'll

1544
01:02:56,400 --> 01:03:02,579
rally 35 or 40 church moms they'll show

1545
01:03:00,179 --> 01:03:05,250
up in force to two or three hearings and

1546
01:03:02,579 --> 01:03:07,139
all of a sudden your city doesn't get to

1547
01:03:05,250 --> 01:03:09,329
enjoy any of the economic benefits of

1548
01:03:07,139 --> 01:03:11,250
legalization and every marijuana

1549
01:03:09,329 --> 01:03:13,829
consumer in that geographic area that

1550
01:03:11,250 --> 01:03:17,179
wants to participate in the legal market

1551
01:03:13,829 --> 01:03:20,449
has to drive to the next County to do so

1552
01:03:17,179 --> 01:03:23,039
because of who showed up at a meeting

1553
01:03:20,449 --> 01:03:24,929
you really really really need to start

1554
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:26,579
taking a look at this especially if you

1555
01:03:24,929 --> 01:03:29,279
want to be part of the industry as an

1556
01:03:26,579 --> 01:03:31,409
owner you've got a chance to get in on

1557
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:33,480
the ground floor right now if you're

1558
01:03:31,409 --> 01:03:35,989
willing to put in serious legislative

1559
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:35,990
legwork

1560
01:03:36,590 --> 01:03:41,390
that's my half this question I just

1561
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:42,620
glanced over a second I was like we're

1562
01:03:41,389 --> 01:03:44,119
in an hour in two minutes I'm almost

1563
01:03:42,619 --> 01:03:46,069
tempted to make this a two-part question

1564
01:03:44,119 --> 01:03:48,799
and cut this dude off now and make

1565
01:03:46,070 --> 01:03:50,570
another episode this your half of the

1566
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:52,760
question is huge

1567
01:03:50,570 --> 01:03:54,710
because there's a lot of stuff we can

1568
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:57,560
give them the glance over if you want I

1569
01:03:54,710 --> 01:03:59,240
think there's enough I mean he asked

1570
01:03:57,559 --> 01:04:00,829
like four questions in here so I think

1571
01:03:59,239 --> 01:04:01,939
we're gonna make this a two-parter are

1572
01:04:00,829 --> 01:04:03,799
you down to record a little bit more

1573
01:04:01,940 --> 01:04:05,900
with me I totally am and I could use

1574
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:07,280
like I knew you needed a stretch break a

1575
01:04:05,900 --> 01:04:13,849
cigarette break I could use a fresh

1576
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:14,450
drink and a couple of dabs so just over

1577
01:04:13,849 --> 01:04:16,400
an hour

1578
01:04:14,449 --> 01:04:17,960
I would rather record two episodes out

1579
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:18,740
of this so Mike and I are gonna take

1580
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:20,990
some dabs

1581
01:04:18,739 --> 01:04:31,459
let's do this if you for your listeners

1582
01:04:20,989 --> 01:04:33,439
because we know if this is for me this

1583
01:04:31,460 --> 01:04:40,760
is more than interesting enough to do a

1584
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:42,260
week I've been trying a lot of times I

1585
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:44,540
try to do two episodes a week but I

1586
01:04:42,260 --> 01:04:45,860
can't commit to that I can't dedicate to

1587
01:04:44,539 --> 01:04:47,690
that so I haven't made the promise but

1588
01:04:45,860 --> 01:04:49,130
the word we have trouble getting one of

1589
01:04:47,690 --> 01:04:51,769
these together a month now just because

1590
01:04:49,130 --> 01:04:53,240
we're both right but we're gonna make

1591
01:04:51,769 --> 01:04:54,679
sure that these two episodes come out on

1592
01:04:53,239 --> 01:04:56,419
a Monday and a Thursday back-to-back

1593

back on some wheels really two minutes

1650
01:12:00,510 --> 01:12:02,960
and 30 seconds in we're already rambling

1651
01:12:02,220 --> 01:12:04,310
ladies

1652
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:06,079
this is part two of an episode that we

1653
01:12:04,310 --> 01:12:08,170
did a feud I actually recorded like an

1654
01:12:06,079 --> 01:12:10,609
hour ago you heard it a few days ago

1655
01:12:08,170 --> 01:12:12,020
there was an email and it started off

1656
01:12:10,609 --> 01:12:13,849
with questions for Mike and then there

1657
01:12:12,020 --> 01:12:16,520
was a part two that had questions about

1658
01:12:13,850 --> 01:12:18,260
going from a basement grow into a large

1659
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:19,340
facility so let me catch you up on the

1660
01:12:18,260 --> 01:12:21,140
email I read all the way from the

1661
01:12:19,340 --> 01:12:22,640
beginning it says hey what's up Rasta

1662
01:12:21,140 --> 01:12:24,530
Jeff huge fan of the podcast as I've

1663
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:26,570
said before I had a few questions I

1664
01:12:24,529 --> 01:12:27,920
thought could be a podcast I'm in

1665
01:12:26,569 --> 01:12:29,988
Michigan we just passed three bills

1666
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:32,449
pushing us into a seed to sale system

1667
01:12:29,988 --> 01:12:34,129
based on Colorado system I was wondering

1668
01:12:32,449 --> 01:12:36,079
if you would white Mike could touch on

1669
01:12:34,130 --> 01:12:38,359
the subject like how do I go about

1670
01:12:36,079 --> 01:12:40,250
finding out information from the city

1671
01:12:38,359 --> 01:12:42,799
about how many license facilities they

1672
01:12:40,250 --> 01:12:45,229
will allow that part we handled on the

1673
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:47,539
last episode I hope you listen to it if

1674
01:12:45,229 --> 01:12:49,549

1675
01:12:47,539 --> 01:12:51,529
158 and check it out then come back and

1676
01:12:49,550 --> 01:12:52,789
see us so the second part of the

1677
01:12:51,529 --> 01:12:55,819
question what we're going to address

1678
01:12:52,789 --> 01:12:57,380
today he says what is the biggest hurdle

1679
01:12:55,819 --> 01:12:59,449
going from a basement grow to a

1680
01:12:57,380 --> 01:13:01,640
warehouse I know you've recently made

1681
01:12:59,449 --> 01:13:03,889
the switch from soil to cocoa any advice

1682
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:06,380
on that transition he also says I'm

1683
01:13:03,890 --> 01:13:08,030
planning on using veg bloom I'm already

1684
01:13:06,380 --> 01:13:10,699
in the basement but do you add anything

1685
01:13:08,029 --> 01:13:12,109
else to their line as well what are some

1686
01:13:10,699 --> 01:13:14,539
things you didn't expect going to a

1687
01:13:12,109 --> 01:13:16,039
large-scale and any other advice you

1688
01:13:14,539 --> 01:13:18,289
think one would need to know about

1689
01:13:16,039 --> 01:13:20,869
taking the leap into the big leagues

1690

question yes

1705
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:59,110
thanks yeah this is a great question

1706
01:13:59,380 --> 01:14:05,239
this question he says or is it what is

1707
01:14:03,649 --> 01:14:07,969
the biggest hurdle going from a basement

1708
01:14:05,238 --> 01:14:09,709
grow to a warehouse there are a lot of

1709
01:14:07,969 --> 01:14:11,869
things to think about there one of the

1710
01:14:09,710 --> 01:14:15,020
biggest things that I noticed was

1711
01:14:11,869 --> 01:14:16,729
different was the airflow

1712
01:14:15,020 --> 01:14:18,800
a large building the air doesn't feel

1713
01:14:16,729 --> 01:14:20,569
like it does in a small room you can

1714
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:22,100
change the air out in a small bedroom in

1715
01:14:20,569 --> 01:14:24,439
a matter of minutes with a small blower

1716
01:14:22,100 --> 01:14:25,880
a large room you're gonna have hot spots

1717
01:14:24,439 --> 01:14:27,409
you're gonna have cool spots you're

1718
01:14:25,880 --> 01:14:29,989
gonna find humid spots you're gonna need

1719
01:14:27,409 --> 01:14:32,029
to learn how to control that temperature

1720
01:14:29,989 --> 01:14:34,819
and the humidity all throughout a large

1721
01:14:32,029 --> 01:14:37,909
room it's the scale of the increase is

1722
01:14:34,819 --> 01:14:39,739
where every time you've done many legal

1723
01:14:37,909 --> 01:14:42,460
retailers and production facilities are

1724
01:14:39,739 --> 01:14:45,289
still problems shooting their their

1725
01:14:42,460 --> 01:14:47,840
multi-million dollar grows because the

1726
01:14:45,289 --> 01:14:50,449
difference in scope from a basement grow

1727
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:53,600
or a smaller grow to a huge warehouse is

1728
01:14:50,449 --> 01:14:55,159
monumental a good reliable HVAC company

1729
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:56,360
in Colorado that will come work on a

1730
01:14:55,159 --> 01:14:58,670
grow and knows what they're doing

1731
01:14:56,359 --> 01:15:00,109
we'll make you wait three months just to

1732
01:14:58,670 --> 01:15:01,730
come give you an estimate because they

1733
01:15:00,109 --> 01:15:05,479
are so backed up with cannabis growers

1734
01:15:01,729 --> 01:15:07,549
right now if I had enough money to do

1735
01:15:05,479 --> 01:15:10,819
anything I wanted cannabis business-wise

1736
01:15:07,550 --> 01:15:13,400
I would build from the ground up because

1737
01:15:10,819 --> 01:15:16,460
I've seen what so many companies have

1738
01:15:13,399 --> 01:15:20,149
had to go through attempting to improve

1739
01:15:16,460 --> 01:15:23,149
an existing structure to where it's not

1740
01:15:20,149 --> 01:15:24,679
giving them problems so many people that

1741
01:15:23,149 --> 01:15:26,809
I mean they thought they had everything

1742
01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:29,930
under control and then as the season

1743
01:15:26,810 --> 01:15:32,840
started to change one whole wall was the

1744
01:15:29,930 --> 01:15:35,500
temperature change in that wall was

1745
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:37,699
causing major problems and it grow I

1746
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:39,949
mean that's not a unique problem that

1747
01:15:37,699 --> 01:15:42,500
happened to a lot of people if you're

1748
01:15:39,949 --> 01:15:44,659
one wall you're whichever whichever side

1749
01:15:42,500 --> 01:15:45,800
gets the most Sun or the least Sun it

1750
01:15:44,659 --> 01:15:47,960
just kind of depends on your environment

1751
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:50,390
when the seasons change in Colorado

1752
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:51,859
you'll usually see in a grow that you've

1753
01:15:50,390 --> 01:15:53,300
never been in before you have to find

1754
01:15:51,859 --> 01:15:55,159
out where the powdery mildew is gonna

1755
01:15:53,300 --> 01:15:56,539
happen when the first winter comes you

1756
01:15:55,159 --> 01:15:58,340
just gotta find out where it's gonna

1757
01:15:56,539 --> 01:15:59,539
happen because it probably will if you

1758
01:15:58,340 --> 01:16:01,789
if you haven't designed your room

1759
01:15:59,539 --> 01:16:03,260
flawlessly you're on one wall

1760
01:16:01,789 --> 01:16:05,119
you're probably gonna give you in an

1761
01:16:03,260 --> 01:16:06,980
exterior wall you're gonna get powdery

1762
01:16:05,119 --> 01:16:10,069
mildew that over the season you and I

1763
01:16:06,979 --> 01:16:13,099
can problem shoo a basement grow or a

1764
01:16:10,069 --> 01:16:16,309
bedroom grow in like 20 minutes an hour

1765
01:16:13,100 --> 01:16:18,079
or two I mean in the end by troubleshoot

1766
01:16:16,310 --> 01:16:20,360
I mean like find the problems and

1767
01:16:18,079 --> 01:16:22,100
suggest easy ways to fix them I can walk

1768
01:16:20,359 --> 01:16:23,869
in home like a basement growing point

1769
01:16:22,100 --> 01:16:25,370
out ten things in ten seconds we can

1770
01:16:23,869 --> 01:16:26,639
improve your grow and make you question

1771
01:16:25,369 --> 01:16:29,069
you know where

1772
01:16:26,639 --> 01:16:32,668
grow part of its just put in the time

1773
01:16:29,069 --> 01:16:34,799
right to get through the cyber your huge

1774
01:16:32,668 --> 01:16:37,769
meeting and cooling a lot of people

1775
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:39,059
don't aim for enough cooling they don't

1776
01:16:37,769 --> 01:16:40,439
think they're gonna need enough cooling

1777
01:16:39,059 --> 01:16:41,699
and then they put plenty of cooling or

1778
01:16:40,439 --> 01:16:43,949
they don't think about enough airflow

1779
01:16:41,698 --> 01:16:57,178
you have to evacuate humidity out of

1780
01:16:43,948 --> 01:16:59,668
there so I know I'm sure that's true I

1781
01:16:57,179 --> 01:17:01,050
just happen to know the one so the

1782
01:16:59,668 --> 01:17:02,908
airflow is gonna be a huge thing also

1783
01:17:01,050 --> 01:17:04,349
you're gonna be feeding on a much larger

1784
01:17:02,908 --> 01:17:06,118
scale or you're gonna build a drip

1785
01:17:04,349 --> 01:17:08,069
system are you gonna be watering by hand

1786
01:17:06,118 --> 01:17:09,299
every time you run that drip system

1787
01:17:08,069 --> 01:17:10,648
you're creating more humidity in the

1788
01:17:09,300 --> 01:17:12,329
room that you're gonna have to deal with

1789
01:17:10,649 --> 01:17:13,590
every time you water by hand there's

1790
01:17:12,328 --> 01:17:15,118
gonna be more humidity do you have a

1791
01:17:13,590 --> 01:17:16,649
drain do you have a floor dream that's

1792
01:17:15,118 --> 01:17:18,118
something I would definitely look for if

1793
01:17:16,649 --> 01:17:21,059
you're moving into a new building a

1794
01:17:18,118 --> 01:17:21,988
floor dream treating water is a huge

1795
01:17:21,059 --> 01:17:24,119
deal

1796
01:17:21,988 --> 01:17:26,609
treating water you're gonna have if

1797
01:17:24,118 --> 01:17:27,839
you're moving into a warehouse at the at

1798
01:17:26,609 --> 01:17:29,279
the green and healthy warehouse we used

1799
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:31,800
about a thousand gallons of water every

1800
01:17:29,279 --> 01:17:33,719
other day ish you're gonna need to treat

1801
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:36,029
that somehow I would recommend a really

1802
01:17:33,719 --> 01:17:37,529
nice reverse osmosis machine because

1803
01:17:36,029 --> 01:17:39,118
something I noticed was we were using

1804
01:17:37,529 --> 01:17:43,590
the water they came from the meanness of

1805
01:17:39,118 --> 01:17:45,478
our buckets and boulders oh my god the

1806
01:17:43,590 --> 01:17:48,779
scale is what we're getting at here guys

1807
01:17:45,479 --> 01:17:53,429
is when you're talking about a basement

1808
01:17:48,779 --> 01:17:55,109
grow you're talking about one employee

1809
01:17:53,429 --> 01:17:58,078
you're talking about a thousand dollars

1810
01:17:55,109 --> 01:18:01,889
of equipment little warehouse you

1811
01:17:58,078 --> 01:18:03,299
multiply those numbers by 100 right let

1812
01:18:01,889 --> 01:18:04,979
me get back in this we were using the

1813
01:18:03,300 --> 01:18:08,458
municipal water from Colorado Springs

1814
01:18:04,979 --> 01:18:10,320
and as the temperature would change the

1815
01:18:08,458 --> 01:18:12,208
smell of the water would change I could

1816
01:18:10,319 --> 01:18:14,099
smell chlorine in on some days I could

1817
01:18:12,208 --> 01:18:16,559
smell other things on some days and I

1818
01:18:14,099 --> 01:18:18,479
would do a simple pH test and on some

1819
01:18:16,559 --> 01:18:20,579
days the pH would be 7 some days it

1820
01:18:18,479 --> 01:18:23,130
would be 9 and it would just be days

1821
01:18:20,578 --> 01:18:24,929
apart from that and then I would do ppm

1822
01:18:23,130 --> 01:18:26,760
tests and sometimes it'd be really high

1823
01:18:24,929 --> 01:18:29,550
sometimes it would be really really low

1824
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:31,559
and we're feeding cocoa where our plants

1825
01:18:29,550 --> 01:18:33,149
are in cocoa so it was really hard to

1826
01:18:31,559 --> 01:18:35,788
predict what water you're gonna get

1827
01:18:33,149 --> 01:18:38,130
tomorrow or the next day or the next day

1828
01:18:35,788 --> 01:18:39,538
so an RO machine would really be really

1829
01:18:38,130 --> 01:18:40,270
helpful in a large grow that's something

1830
01:18:39,538 --> 01:18:41,590
I would HIGHLY

1831
01:18:40,270 --> 01:18:43,720
recommend is you're gonna need clean

1832
01:18:41,590 --> 01:18:45,880
water you're gonna need a lot of it have

1833
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:48,190
more RO water than you think you're

1834
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:58,869
going to need available because if you

1835
01:18:48,189 --> 01:19:02,049
get too much bugs if you get a problem

1836
01:18:58,869 --> 01:19:03,609
like bugs or powdery mildew you're going

1837
01:19:02,050 --> 01:19:05,829
to have a larger problem than you have

1838
01:19:03,609 --> 01:19:07,059
ever thought of having because hopefully

1839
01:19:05,829 --> 01:19:08,649
you're running a perpetual grow if

1840
01:19:07,060 --> 01:19:10,120
you've got a large system and you're

1841
01:19:08,649 --> 01:19:11,589
gonna have plants that are in full

1842
01:19:10,119 --> 01:19:14,380
flower at the end of flower and you

1843
01:19:11,590 --> 01:19:16,690
can't treat those for a bug so be highly

1844
01:19:14,380 --> 01:19:18,550
prepared for pests and pathogens and

1845
01:19:16,689 --> 01:19:21,250
powdery mildew be on the lookout be

1846
01:19:18,550 --> 01:19:22,510
ahead of that don't bring anybody into

1847
01:19:21,250 --> 01:19:25,840
that grow unless it is absolutely

1848
01:19:22,510 --> 01:19:27,520
necessary it's you have to get clones

1849
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:29,350
from somewhere but when clones come in

1850
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:30,880
quarantine them treat the [ __ ] out of

1851
01:19:29,350 --> 01:19:32,530
them almost kill them you're treating

1852
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:33,760
them so hard for pests and mold because

1853
01:19:32,529 --> 01:19:36,759
you don't want to bring any of that

1854
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:39,520
stuff in I know a lot of facilities that

1855
01:19:36,760 --> 01:19:41,289
have just they've given up trying to

1856
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:44,140
treat clones and they're seen only now

1857
01:19:41,289 --> 01:19:46,149
Wow I know a few outfits that have just

1858
01:19:44,140 --> 01:19:48,280
given up entirely and I know a lot of

1859
01:19:46,149 --> 01:19:50,379
home growers that are that's been their

1860
01:19:48,279 --> 01:19:53,349
policy since the last time they got a

1861
01:19:50,380 --> 01:19:56,460
gift clone scheduling and getting

1862
01:19:53,350 --> 01:19:59,289
everything on track in a big grow is a

1863
01:19:56,460 --> 01:20:02,140
challenge in the beginning unless you're

1864
01:19:59,289 --> 01:20:03,640
a guy like myself that is kind of OCD so

1865
01:20:02,140 --> 01:20:05,680
you're gonna need to get a good schedule

1866
01:20:03,640 --> 01:20:07,840
happening you're going to need to get a

1867
01:20:05,680 --> 01:20:09,310
fed plants then you're going to need

1868
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:10,659
flowering plants then you're going to

1869
01:20:09,310 --> 01:20:12,280
need clones and you're gonna need to

1870
01:20:10,659 --> 01:20:13,630
keep in mind that these flowering plants

1871
01:20:12,279 --> 01:20:16,090
are going to be done in this amount of

1872
01:20:13,630 --> 01:20:18,039
time and I need this many veg plants to

1873
01:20:16,090 --> 01:20:20,140
replace them immediately because you do

1874
01:20:18,039 --> 01:20:22,420
not want downtime and that's gonna kind

1875
01:20:20,140 --> 01:20:25,240
of segue me into something that I can

1876
01:20:22,420 --> 01:20:27,250
really rant about personally the hugest

1877
01:20:25,239 --> 01:20:29,710
caveat of going from the basement to a

1878
01:20:27,250 --> 01:20:31,720
wire house grow is often the

1879
01:20:29,710 --> 01:20:34,060
relationship between the money person

1880
01:20:31,720 --> 01:20:36,340
and the actual grower or their so

1881
01:20:34,060 --> 01:20:37,690
oftentimes there's a middleman you're

1882
01:20:36,340 --> 01:20:39,010
going to have an investor you're gonna

1883
01:20:37,689 --> 01:20:40,419
have an owner and you're gonna have a

1884
01:20:39,010 --> 01:20:42,389
grower I'm not sure which position

1885
01:20:40,420 --> 01:20:44,340
you're planning on taking

1886
01:20:42,389 --> 01:20:46,139
please get all of those people on the

1887
01:20:44,340 --> 01:20:48,779
same page because I see a lot of draws

1888
01:20:46,139 --> 01:20:52,650
fail because an investor throws down

1889
01:20:48,779 --> 01:20:54,929
money and he wants money back in [ __ ]

1890
01:20:52,649 --> 01:20:56,908
60 days because you're drawn we where's

1891
01:20:54,929 --> 01:20:59,730
my money and then you've got an owner

1892
01:20:56,908 --> 01:21:01,259
that's rubbing his balls to keep him off

1893
01:20:59,729 --> 01:21:04,049
you for a little while and he's like

1894
01:21:01,260 --> 01:21:05,579
give me 120 days and so now the owner

1895
01:21:04,050 --> 01:21:07,230
will say how long do you need to grow

1896
01:21:05,579 --> 01:21:09,630
this crop and I know that the crops that

1897
01:21:07,229 --> 01:21:12,479
I'm trying to grow take me I'm gonna say

1898
01:21:09,630 --> 01:21:14,670
150 days this is hypothetical I need 150

1899
01:21:12,479 --> 01:21:16,138
days to make this crop happen the owner

1900
01:21:14,670 --> 01:21:17,880
of that facility is gonna look you dead

1901
01:21:16,139 --> 01:21:20,190
in the face and go cool I'll see you in

1902
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:21,179
120 days and it should be done and now

1903
01:21:20,189 --> 01:21:23,879
you're saying to yourself these are

1904
01:21:21,179 --> 01:21:24,960
[ __ ] plants I can't cut 30 days for

1905
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:26,850
this cycle there's no way it's gonna

1906
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:28,920
happen so you've got an owner bitching

1907
01:21:26,850 --> 01:21:30,449
or investor bitching in an owner an

1908
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:32,670
owner Yellin or to grow or a grower that

1909
01:21:30,448 --> 01:21:33,960
wants to do the absolute best he can for

1910
01:21:32,670 --> 01:21:36,149
these plants because that's where the

1911
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:37,679
passion is but the owner has got to make

1912
01:21:36,149 --> 01:21:38,670
money he's got to return the investment

1913
01:21:37,679 --> 01:21:41,819
and then you've got an investor that

1914
01:21:38,670 --> 01:21:43,529
only cares about the money so the

1915
01:21:41,819 --> 01:21:45,630
hardest part of a commercial grow is

1916
01:21:43,529 --> 01:21:47,698
getting all of your people on the same

1917
01:21:45,630 --> 01:21:50,190
page you need your owner your investor

1918
01:21:47,698 --> 01:21:51,539
your master grower then you need whoever

1919
01:21:50,189 --> 01:21:53,189
else you've got in there if you've got

1920
01:21:51,539 --> 01:21:53,969
somebody working the bedroom and the

1921
01:21:53,189 --> 01:21:56,219
flower room

1922
01:21:53,969 --> 01:21:58,079
those two people need to have a meeting

1923
01:21:56,219 --> 01:22:00,810
every couple of days if you've got a

1924
01:21:58,079 --> 01:22:02,880
trim crew your master grower and your

1925
01:22:00,810 --> 01:22:04,889
assistant grower and your trim crew

1926
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:06,569
leader all need to communicate you need

1927
01:22:04,889 --> 01:22:08,699
to know what plants are coming down you

1928
01:22:06,569 --> 01:22:09,988
need to know how long you have to trim

1929
01:22:08,698 --> 01:22:12,149
this until there's more plant so that

1930
01:22:09,988 --> 01:22:13,649
you can schedule for the trimmers to be

1931
01:22:12,149 --> 01:22:16,289
there those are some of the things that

1932
01:22:13,649 --> 01:22:17,579
you may overlook it's just so the scale

1933
01:22:16,289 --> 01:22:20,819
and the scope are so much more

1934
01:22:17,579 --> 01:22:23,189
complicated than a basement grow I mean

1935
01:22:20,819 --> 01:22:24,658
with a basement grow you're getting

1936
01:22:23,189 --> 01:22:26,698
ready to harvest you check out your

1937
01:22:24,658 --> 01:22:29,250
plants every to every couple of you know

1938
01:22:26,698 --> 01:22:31,079
days for a week when they get to where

1939
01:22:29,250 --> 01:22:34,170
you want them you just start harvesting

1940
01:22:31,079 --> 01:22:35,550
maybe you call a buddy if you maybe make

1941
01:22:34,170 --> 01:22:37,469
a little plan and have two friends

1942
01:22:35,550 --> 01:22:39,210
coming over when you're talking about an

1943
01:22:37,469 --> 01:22:41,069
industrial scale you're talking about

1944
01:22:39,210 --> 01:22:46,170
like 15 or 20 people that need to be

1945
01:22:41,069 --> 01:22:49,529
scheduled paid w-2 trained I believe two

1946
01:22:46,170 --> 01:22:50,908
or three people could run one or two

1947
01:22:49,529 --> 01:22:54,988
people can run 100 like gross

1948
01:22:50,908 --> 01:22:55,738
efficiently people pissed right but when

1949
01:22:54,988 --> 01:22:57,328
it comes time to try

1950
01:22:55,738 --> 01:22:58,768
then you need a small trim crew you need

1951
01:22:57,328 --> 01:23:00,748
five or six people that's when you need

1952
01:22:58,769 --> 01:23:02,699
that trim crew manager maybe that

1953
01:23:00,748 --> 01:23:04,529
assistant grower now becomes also the

1954
01:23:02,698 --> 01:23:06,268
trim crew manager but you're gonna need

1955
01:23:04,529 --> 01:23:08,698
somebody that can delegate somebody that

1956
01:23:06,269 --> 01:23:10,139
can man you need a director that can

1957
01:23:08,698 --> 01:23:11,698
direct the facility that can direct the

1958
01:23:10,139 --> 01:23:13,078
employees that knows about the plants

1959
01:23:11,698 --> 01:23:14,908
that knows about people that know and

1960
01:23:13,078 --> 01:23:17,279
then you need like I said in the last

1961
01:23:14,908 --> 01:23:18,238
episode a lawyer and an accountant those

1962
01:23:17,279 --> 01:23:20,009
are some things that you're definitely

1963
01:23:18,238 --> 01:23:22,649
gonna need in a larger grow that you

1964
01:23:20,010 --> 01:23:27,059
didn't think as much about and the other

1965
01:23:22,649 --> 01:23:30,118
grow also goes wrong every day in a

1966
01:23:27,059 --> 01:23:32,550
large scale grow well in a lot of times

1967
01:23:30,118 --> 01:23:35,189
investors don't necessarily know any of

1968
01:23:32,550 --> 01:23:37,219
that which is where a lot of headaches

1969
01:23:35,189 --> 01:23:39,598
and a lot of partnerships break up is

1970
01:23:37,219 --> 01:23:41,639
the money man doesn't know anything

1971
01:23:39,599 --> 01:23:45,239
about marijuana and so they doesn't

1972
01:23:41,639 --> 01:23:46,828
realize that something so simple is when

1973
01:23:45,238 --> 01:23:48,658
we were doing trimmer interviews we

1974
01:23:46,828 --> 01:23:51,488
walked a dude through the grow and we

1975
01:23:48,658 --> 01:23:55,238
think he gave us drifts

1976
01:23:51,488 --> 01:23:58,839
and that's why this crop is 1/3 smaller

1977
01:23:55,238 --> 01:24:00,099
than it should be ah like there's

1978
01:23:58,840 --> 01:24:02,529
there's stuff that comes up because

1979
01:24:00,100 --> 01:24:04,660
you're dealing with plant growth and

1980
01:24:02,529 --> 01:24:08,738
you're dealing with a live plant in a

1981
01:24:04,659 --> 01:24:14,019
medium where mistakes can mean millions

1982
01:24:08,738 --> 01:24:15,789
in lost revenue or delays this we really

1983
01:24:14,020 --> 01:24:19,000
can't get it out of enough the scope is

1984
01:24:15,789 --> 01:24:20,800
so much different the attitude and the

1985
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:23,619
skill sets are different

1986
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:27,310
one of the biggest traits for a basement

1987
01:24:23,619 --> 01:24:30,909
grower is secrecy the ability to hide

1988
01:24:27,310 --> 01:24:33,430
and stay hidden that keeps people

1989
01:24:30,909 --> 01:24:35,789
shotguns away from your door whether

1990
01:24:33,430 --> 01:24:37,989
they be law enforcement or rippers

1991
01:24:35,789 --> 01:24:40,659
that's one of the biggest skill sets you

1992
01:24:37,988 --> 01:24:43,059
can have is a basement grower as a legal

1993
01:24:40,659 --> 01:24:45,519
marijuana business owner you need to be

1994
01:24:43,060 --> 01:24:47,350
very out front loud and proud about what

1995
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:50,770
you do how you do it in the fact that

1996
01:24:47,350 --> 01:24:52,780
you love to follow the rules I love to

1997
01:24:50,770 --> 01:24:56,410
follow the rules and I make sure all my

1998
01:24:52,779 --> 01:24:59,769
employees follow the rules and you need

1999
01:24:56,409 --> 01:25:01,359
to get uses especially if you want to be

2000
01:24:59,770 --> 01:25:04,060
one of the first marijuana business

2001
01:25:01,359 --> 01:25:05,589
owners in your area in Colorado we have

2002
01:25:04,060 --> 01:25:08,140
somebody that's known as a compliance

2003
01:25:05,590 --> 01:25:09,730
officer and his only job is to make sure

2004
01:25:08,140 --> 01:25:11,920
that you're following all of the rules

2005
01:25:09,729 --> 01:25:13,539
he gets emails from here we have the

2006
01:25:11,920 --> 01:25:15,369
meed the marijuana Enforcement Division

2007
01:25:13,539 --> 01:25:16,960
he gets emails from them every day

2008
01:25:15,369 --> 01:25:19,238
saying that you know that this is a new

2009
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:21,850
rule this is a new rule and it's his job

2010
01:25:19,238 --> 01:25:23,829
to go whether it's the retail or the

2011
01:25:21,850 --> 01:25:25,300
grow or the extraction facility it's his

2012
01:25:23,829 --> 01:25:27,189
job to get the employees together and

2013
01:25:25,300 --> 01:25:29,650
say this is the rule and he has to

2014
01:25:27,189 --> 01:25:31,329
oversee that that happens if rule

2015
01:25:29,649 --> 01:25:35,589
changes like that a frequent here in

2016
01:25:31,329 --> 01:25:38,109
Colorado and until nationwide we really

2017
01:25:35,590 --> 01:25:40,360
good legalization handed out or hammered

2018
01:25:38,109 --> 01:25:45,069
out and they'll be common in your area

2019
01:25:40,359 --> 01:25:47,069
too so be ready so I did in the past I'm

2020
01:25:45,069 --> 01:25:49,179
sure that we did an entire episode on

2021
01:25:47,069 --> 01:25:50,619
going from a basement grow to a

2022
01:25:49,180 --> 01:25:52,539
large-scale grow and pretty sure that we

2023
01:25:50,619 --> 01:25:54,519
did an entire episode on that I will

2024
01:25:52,539 --> 01:25:55,750
leave that in the show notes there will

2025
01:25:54,520 --> 01:25:57,370
be a link to that in the show notes or

2026
01:25:55,750 --> 01:25:59,800
if you go to the website

2027
01:25:57,369 --> 01:26:00,699
I read genetics Colorado comm and scroll

2028
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:02,739
through the shows I'm sure you'll be

2029
01:26:00,699 --> 01:26:04,300
able to find it on there I cannot recall

2030
01:26:02,738 --> 01:26:04,959
the episode number right now and I do

2031
01:26:04,300 --> 01:26:06,310
not want to

2032
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:08,680
through old episodes while we're

2033
01:26:06,310 --> 01:26:10,300
recording so I look for that it's a

2034
01:26:08,680 --> 01:26:12,190
whole episode about moving from a

2035
01:26:10,300 --> 01:26:14,409
basement grow to a large-scale grow one

2036
01:26:12,189 --> 01:26:16,389
of the the things that we haven't really

2037
01:26:14,409 --> 01:26:18,130
hit that you have available now that

2038
01:26:16,390 --> 01:26:21,250
wasn't available to us when we started

2039
01:26:18,130 --> 01:26:25,510
this is you you can come to Colorado now

2040
01:26:21,250 --> 01:26:27,310
and hire a consultant or go visit a

2041
01:26:25,510 --> 01:26:31,930
couple of legal businesses and see how

2042
01:26:27,310 --> 01:26:33,700
they do it and get an idea of what's

2043
01:26:31,930 --> 01:26:36,550
gonna be required of you and where you

2044
01:26:33,699 --> 01:26:40,779
want to go and I know a number of people

2045
01:26:36,550 --> 01:26:42,310
out here in Colorado have been hired to

2046
01:26:40,779 --> 01:26:43,899
travel out to other states and help

2047
01:26:42,310 --> 01:26:46,300
people navigate some of the things like

2048
01:26:43,899 --> 01:26:49,059
planning out warehouse grows just the

2049
01:26:46,300 --> 01:26:50,739
logistics that go into these things will

2050
01:26:49,060 --> 01:26:53,560
blow your mind the amount of cooling

2051
01:26:50,739 --> 01:26:56,229
that's required for a one-story

2052
01:26:53,560 --> 01:26:58,750
warehouse grow is typically greater than

2053
01:26:56,229 --> 01:27:00,759
like a 30 story office building I mean

2054
01:26:58,750 --> 01:27:02,829
the amount of equipment that's necessary

2055
01:27:00,760 --> 01:27:06,039
is just insane learning how to maintain

2056
01:27:02,829 --> 01:27:09,340
and all that equipment like we're

2057
01:27:06,039 --> 01:27:11,500
talking about pot growers the amount of

2058
01:27:09,340 --> 01:27:13,300
information that needs to be learned and

2059
01:27:11,500 --> 01:27:15,039
adapted to his money man that's

2060
01:27:13,300 --> 01:27:16,659
something that's something that I

2061
01:27:15,039 --> 01:27:18,340
quickly learned is I'm not just a pot

2062
01:27:16,659 --> 01:27:20,439
grower anymore I learned how to build

2063
01:27:18,340 --> 01:27:25,239
drip systems with PVC I learned how to

2064
01:27:20,439 --> 01:27:26,949
work on humidifiers now I know how to

2065
01:27:25,239 --> 01:27:28,149
work on the security camera system now I

2066
01:27:26,949 --> 01:27:30,010
know how to build [ __ ] and I never

2067
01:27:28,149 --> 01:27:31,569
thought I would and it's just all

2068
01:27:30,010 --> 01:27:33,190
because I went and helped with a giant

2069
01:27:31,569 --> 01:27:35,949
commercial facility and I learned a ton

2070
01:27:33,189 --> 01:27:37,809
of things well no and it's you you need

2071
01:27:35,949 --> 01:27:39,069
such a varied skill set because little

2072
01:27:37,810 --> 01:27:41,560
things that don't have anything to do

2073
01:27:39,069 --> 01:27:44,349
with growing marijuana can affect your

2074
01:27:41,560 --> 01:27:47,080
legal ability to do so if you see a

2075
01:27:44,350 --> 01:27:50,110
camera down and they grow and you ignore

2076
01:27:47,079 --> 01:27:52,090
it you might get hit with a compliance

2077
01:27:50,109 --> 01:27:55,259
violation because that camera was down

2078
01:27:52,090 --> 01:27:55,260
for an extra half day

2079
01:27:56,679 --> 01:28:01,210
and have your business shut that quickly

2080
01:27:59,529 --> 01:28:03,130
all right so he's got more parts of this

2081
01:28:01,210 --> 01:28:04,270
question I don't want to harp on the one

2082
01:28:03,130 --> 01:28:06,940
part for too long because the last

2083
01:28:04,270 --> 01:28:09,340
episode got Wong that way did I just say

2084
01:28:06,939 --> 01:28:11,439
harp on it jeez how old am I getting so

2085
01:28:09,340 --> 01:28:13,630
he also said I know you've recently made

2086
01:28:11,439 --> 01:28:15,158
the switch from soil to cocoa any advice

2087
01:28:13,630 --> 01:28:17,469
on that transition

2088
01:28:15,158 --> 01:28:19,329
he also says I'm planning on running veg

2089
01:28:17,469 --> 01:28:20,590
bloom and I am already in a basement but

2090
01:28:19,329 --> 01:28:24,698
do you add anything else to the veg

2091
01:28:20,590 --> 01:28:26,949
bloom wine as well um so that's kind of

2092
01:28:24,698 --> 01:28:28,719
a multi-part question there I've made

2093
01:28:26,948 --> 01:28:31,509
the switch from soil to cocoa any advice

2094
01:28:28,719 --> 01:28:33,310
on that transition yes I use an easy

2095
01:28:31,510 --> 01:28:34,869
cloner and I take my clones from the

2096
01:28:33,310 --> 01:28:37,150
easy corner and I put them in to Solo

2097
01:28:34,868 --> 01:28:38,500
cups the Solo cups have got holes in the

2098
01:28:37,149 --> 01:28:39,969
bottom of them so that they can drain

2099
01:28:38,500 --> 01:28:41,859
plenty of water in the water doesn't get

2100
01:28:39,969 --> 01:28:44,770
stuck in there I usually fill the cups

2101
01:28:41,859 --> 01:28:47,679
with a aerated soil something like Fox

2102
01:28:44,770 --> 01:28:49,510
farms either ocean forest or the happy

2103
01:28:47,679 --> 01:28:50,859
frog and I put the clones into there and

2104
01:28:49,510 --> 01:28:54,010
then I water them with my desired

2105
01:28:50,859 --> 01:28:56,079
nutrient solution I did so this time but

2106
01:28:54,010 --> 01:28:59,079
I used cocoa instead of the aerated soil

2107
01:28:56,079 --> 01:29:00,849
and 50% of my clones died they [ __ ]

2108
01:28:59,079 --> 01:29:03,158
hated going into cocoa they were not

2109
01:29:00,849 --> 01:29:05,110
happy about that the cocoa seems to have

2110
01:29:03,158 --> 01:29:06,698
compressed and smothered them they did

2111
01:29:05,109 --> 01:29:09,880
not get a chance to get their legs and

2112
01:29:06,698 --> 01:29:11,289
they got crushed and killed so my

2113
01:29:09,880 --> 01:29:12,520
thought on that is put your clones into

2114
01:29:11,289 --> 01:29:14,649
soil if that's what you're doing because

2115
01:29:12,520 --> 01:29:16,090
they did not like the cocoa go into cups

2116
01:29:14,649 --> 01:29:17,829
of dirt put those cups of dirt into the

2117
01:29:16,090 --> 01:29:19,420
cocoa in the future that's what I have

2118
01:29:17,829 --> 01:29:23,079
learned because my plants were really

2119
01:29:19,420 --> 01:29:25,090
really picky go dirt clones - cocoa

2120
01:29:23,079 --> 01:29:26,319
plants easy enough oh yeah just drop

2121
01:29:25,090 --> 01:29:28,270
right in there they love it just gonna

2122
01:29:26,319 --> 01:29:32,049
don't mind in the transition once those

2123
01:29:28,270 --> 01:29:33,550
roots strengthen up a bit right the

2124
01:29:32,050 --> 01:29:36,099
weight of the water in that cocoa

2125
01:29:33,550 --> 01:29:37,480
compressed the cocoa real tight yes new

2126
01:29:36,099 --> 01:29:39,369
roots and they've just got crushed in

2127
01:29:37,479 --> 01:29:42,549
there so that's one thing that I learned

2128
01:29:39,368 --> 01:29:45,519
also you can water a whole heck of a lot

2129
01:29:42,550 --> 01:29:46,570
more you can feed more frequently is

2130
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:48,250
what I think I'm trying to say I'm sorry

2131
01:29:46,569 --> 01:29:50,349
you can't water a lot more you can feed

2132
01:29:48,250 --> 01:29:53,319
a heck of a lot more when I was running

2133
01:29:50,349 --> 01:29:55,420
soil I would feed maybe twice twice a

2134
01:29:53,319 --> 01:29:58,569
week now every time I am watering the

2135
01:29:55,420 --> 01:30:00,460
plants they are getting nutrients so let

2136
01:29:58,569 --> 01:30:01,719
three maybe four times a week these

2137
01:30:00,460 --> 01:30:03,219
plants are getting nutrients and they

2138
01:30:01,719 --> 01:30:05,319
don't show any signs of burn and they

2139
01:30:03,219 --> 01:30:07,039
are growing vigorously that the cocoa

2140
01:30:05,319 --> 01:30:09,049
not holding your nuts as well

2141
01:30:07,039 --> 01:30:12,319
the cocoa it doesn't hold honor all the

2142
01:30:09,050 --> 01:30:13,940
nutrients just you don't get as much

2143
01:30:12,319 --> 01:30:15,559
burned and you can feed more frequently

2144
01:30:13,939 --> 01:30:16,869
it'll eat what it wants better for your

2145
01:30:15,560 --> 01:30:20,300
plants but not your wallet

2146
01:30:16,869 --> 01:30:21,529
well maybe in the end it'll pay for it

2147
01:30:20,300 --> 01:30:22,730
I'm thinking if it's gonna eat that much

2148
01:30:21,529 --> 01:30:24,170
there's gonna be that much more weight

2149
01:30:22,729 --> 01:30:26,569
that'll make up for it which isn't a bad

2150
01:30:24,170 --> 01:30:28,880
thing time to do some math something I'm

2151
01:30:26,569 --> 01:30:31,009
thinking I don't know if I'm convinced

2152
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:35,529
on a hundred percent cocoa I may start

2153
01:30:31,010 --> 01:30:38,180
doing a 50 percent soilless mix like a

2154
01:30:35,529 --> 01:30:40,099
honestly not an expensive soil something

2155
01:30:38,180 --> 01:30:41,869
like roots organic or maybe even two per

2156
01:30:40,100 --> 01:30:44,150
or the Fox farm ocean forest wouldn't

2157
01:30:41,869 --> 01:30:47,059
hurt my feelings a 50 percent mix with

2158
01:30:44,149 --> 01:30:48,859
soilless mix and cocoa put the cocoa in

2159
01:30:47,060 --> 01:30:50,900
there I know he's helping people that

2160
01:30:48,859 --> 01:30:52,549
started doing that a while ago and they

2161
01:30:50,899 --> 01:30:54,589
all seem to rave about it yeah I think

2162
01:30:52,550 --> 01:30:57,350
that I'm gonna try that next

2163
01:30:54,590 --> 01:30:58,819
that's next I'm gonna run I'll run one

2164
01:30:57,350 --> 01:31:00,380
light with the cocoa one light with the

2165
01:30:58,819 --> 01:31:01,969
soil and then one light with the cocoa

2166
01:31:00,380 --> 01:31:04,369
soil mix and we'll see what happens so

2167
01:31:01,970 --> 01:31:07,789
that's that's something I feel about the

2168
01:31:04,369 --> 01:31:09,979
the soil too cocoa switch and also I've

2169
01:31:07,789 --> 01:31:11,899
noticed if I overwater they take really

2170
01:31:09,979 --> 01:31:14,419
long to dry out and the plants will kind

2171
01:31:11,899 --> 01:31:15,500
of slow down I thought that I can yeah I

2172
01:31:14,420 --> 01:31:16,819
thought I could water the [ __ ] out of

2173
01:31:15,500 --> 01:31:18,199
them with the cocoa but I've noticed

2174
01:31:16,819 --> 01:31:20,719
that I want some aeration in there if I

2175
01:31:18,199 --> 01:31:22,550
overwater them they really it's really

2176
01:31:20,720 --> 01:31:25,039
like that aeration they do they like

2177
01:31:22,550 --> 01:31:26,930
I've noticed that right when they start

2178
01:31:25,039 --> 01:31:28,430
to dry out is when they really take off

2179
01:31:26,930 --> 01:31:29,900
with the most explosive growth so

2180
01:31:28,430 --> 01:31:32,510
they're getting kind of dry I've only

2181
01:31:29,899 --> 01:31:36,409
ever seen one good aeroponic system in

2182
01:31:32,510 --> 01:31:38,840
motion and I was blown away with this

2183
01:31:36,409 --> 01:31:41,239
dudes timelines the next part of his

2184
01:31:38,840 --> 01:31:43,550
question he said I'm planning on running

2185
01:31:41,239 --> 01:31:46,250
veg bloom and then he said do you add

2186
01:31:43,550 --> 01:31:48,529
anything else to their line as well yes

2187
01:31:46,250 --> 01:31:50,630
actually I've got a screenshot here of a

2188
01:31:48,529 --> 01:31:53,329
conversation I had with a rep from veg

2189
01:31:50,630 --> 01:31:56,150
bloom and he says this is what we are

2190
01:31:53,329 --> 01:32:00,590
recommended to use he said four to five

2191
01:31:56,149 --> 01:32:03,710
grams of base nutrient per gallon in veg

2192
01:32:00,590 --> 01:32:05,840
five grams per gallon and flour so

2193
01:32:03,710 --> 01:32:07,939
you've got your base nutrient it's

2194
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:09,380
probably the HD or the RO or the dirty

2195
01:32:07,939 --> 01:32:10,789
whichever one they selected for you

2196
01:32:09,380 --> 01:32:12,409
hopefully you had a consultation with

2197
01:32:10,789 --> 01:32:13,819
them and had your water checked out is

2198
01:32:12,409 --> 01:32:15,979
if you get your water tested send them

2199
01:32:13,819 --> 01:32:18,139
water test results they will recommend a

2200
01:32:15,979 --> 01:32:20,689
base nutrient for you but 4 to 5 grams

2201
01:32:18,140 --> 01:32:22,730
of base per veg R per gallon and veg

2202
01:32:20,689 --> 01:32:25,729
five grams per gallon in your flowering

2203
01:32:22,729 --> 01:32:28,369
stage then he says 1/2 of gram per

2204
01:32:25,729 --> 01:32:30,169
gallon of + life once a week and that's

2205
01:32:28,369 --> 01:32:33,170
their routing inoculate the plus life I

2206
01:32:30,170 --> 01:32:36,109
really like that stuff half a gram per

2207
01:32:33,170 --> 01:32:39,260
gallon of plus life once a week through

2208
01:32:36,109 --> 01:32:41,210
veg and flour and then taper that off in

2209
01:32:39,260 --> 01:32:43,369
late flour so like around week four or

2210
01:32:41,210 --> 01:32:47,119
five you can start pulling that back and

2211
01:32:43,369 --> 01:32:48,500
then he says shine starting in week 3 so

2212
01:32:47,119 --> 01:32:52,880
at the beginning week three add shine

2213
01:32:48,500 --> 01:32:54,670
put one gram a 1 to 2 grams per gallon

2214
01:32:52,880 --> 01:32:58,010
of water is what he says the shine

2215
01:32:54,670 --> 01:33:00,230
starting in week 3 1 gram - 2 grams per

2216
01:32:58,010 --> 01:33:02,180
gallon of water and then you can kind of

2217
01:33:00,229 --> 01:33:04,009
increase that a little bit as time goes

2218
01:33:02,180 --> 01:33:06,350
on from what I've seen so week 3 do a

2219
01:33:04,010 --> 01:33:08,420
gram - to week 4 increase it a little

2220
01:33:06,350 --> 01:33:10,070
bit week 5 increase it a little bit 6

2221
01:33:08,420 --> 01:33:11,960
and 7 increase it a little bit and then

2222
01:33:10,069 --> 01:33:14,539
start flushing from there and then he

2223
01:33:11,960 --> 01:33:16,880
says push foliar feed every five to six

2224
01:33:14,539 --> 01:33:20,090
days honestly I would cut out the push

2225
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:21,800
foliar feed maybe spray it one time at

2226
01:33:20,090 --> 01:33:23,750
the beginning of week five and then pull

2227
01:33:21,800 --> 01:33:27,560
off of that and he says the push foliar

2228
01:33:23,750 --> 01:33:29,539
to spur a 50 milliliters per gallon of

2229
01:33:27,560 --> 01:33:31,580
water so maybe if you've got a small

2230
01:33:29,539 --> 01:33:35,000
crop just mix up a half gallon and put

2231
01:33:31,579 --> 01:33:36,559
25 mils in there I also think that pH in

2232
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:38,060
that water before you spray it may help

2233
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:40,310
you but be careful what you use to pH

2234
01:33:38,060 --> 01:33:44,000
because you don't want to go killing off

2235
01:33:40,310 --> 01:33:46,070
the live there's a silica acid there's

2236
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:47,600
calcium and there's sea kelp in there so

2237
01:33:46,069 --> 01:33:50,750
be careful what you're using to adjust

2238
01:33:47,600 --> 01:33:53,780
the pH also you asked if I add anything

2239
01:33:50,750 --> 01:33:55,219
to that mix yes I put a little bit of

2240
01:33:53,779 --> 01:33:56,809
Oso 28 in there I like to add some

2241
01:33:55,219 --> 01:33:59,300
potassium silicates to the mix I think

2242
01:33:56,810 --> 01:34:00,739
that gives the plants more vigor it

2243
01:33:59,300 --> 01:34:04,250
makes them a little bit more robust and

2244
01:34:00,738 --> 01:34:06,529
then once about every once a week once

2245
01:34:04,250 --> 01:34:09,050
every 10 days ish I'll hit them with

2246
01:34:06,529 --> 01:34:11,210
either hybrid or carbo-load just to

2247
01:34:09,050 --> 01:34:13,159
speed up some carbohydrates in there put

2248
01:34:11,210 --> 01:34:15,439
a little bit of a boost in there so

2249
01:34:13,159 --> 01:34:17,389
that's what I add to the veg blue mix

2250
01:34:15,439 --> 01:34:19,879
it's not too expensive that way and it

2251
01:34:17,390 --> 01:34:21,320
is highly efficient it'll put some shine

2252
01:34:19,880 --> 01:34:22,460
on your plants it'll make them beefy

2253
01:34:21,319 --> 01:34:25,429
they'll taste good they'll be high in

2254
01:34:22,460 --> 01:34:27,260
THC you will have quality flowers so

2255
01:34:25,430 --> 01:34:28,880
that's what I add to the veg bloom you

2256
01:34:27,260 --> 01:34:31,789
also said you're already there in a

2257
01:34:28,880 --> 01:34:33,650
basement what else what are some things

2258
01:34:31,789 --> 01:34:34,429
you didn't expect going into such a

2259
01:34:33,649 --> 01:34:39,889
large

2260
01:34:34,429 --> 01:34:42,560
honestly be the demand I was expected to

2261
01:34:39,890 --> 01:34:44,750
put out specific amount of cannabis and

2262
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:46,039
a specific amount of time and I didn't

2263
01:34:44,750 --> 01:34:46,908
know that there would be obstacles I

2264
01:34:46,039 --> 01:34:48,859
didn't expect that there would be a

2265
01:34:46,908 --> 01:34:51,139
problem every day when you walk into a

2266
01:34:48,859 --> 01:34:52,639
large commercial grow when I would train

2267
01:34:51,140 --> 01:34:53,690
new people we trained a few new guys and

2268
01:34:52,640 --> 01:34:54,949
they said so what's the first thing we

2269
01:34:53,689 --> 01:34:56,719
do when we get in here because I like to

2270
01:34:54,948 --> 01:34:58,189
you know everyone's like excitedly the

2271
01:34:56,719 --> 01:35:00,408
first thing we got to do is find what

2272
01:34:58,189 --> 01:35:02,119
[ __ ] up last night and I was like what

2273
01:35:00,408 --> 01:35:03,158
and I was like there's so many so many

2274
01:35:02,119 --> 01:35:06,019
moving parts

2275
01:35:03,158 --> 01:35:07,759
something in here just broke and it's

2276
01:35:06,020 --> 01:35:11,080
funny that's the size and scope thing I

2277
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:13,360
was hitting at earlier it's

2278
01:35:11,079 --> 01:35:15,939
in any grow you need to keep an eye on

2279
01:35:13,359 --> 01:35:18,729
the moving parts your timers your plugs

2280
01:35:15,939 --> 01:35:21,069
your palms your hoses connections all of

2281
01:35:18,729 --> 01:35:23,259
it the bigger you grow the more those

2282
01:35:21,069 --> 01:35:26,109
equipment checks eat up into your time

2283
01:35:23,260 --> 01:35:28,360
when you're talking about a hundred

2284
01:35:26,109 --> 01:35:31,329
light or a five hundred light massive

2285
01:35:28,359 --> 01:35:33,189
warehouse checking to make sure none of

2286
01:35:31,329 --> 01:35:34,960
your drip system plugs have come loose

2287
01:35:33,189 --> 01:35:37,329
and you're spraying water towards your

2288
01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:40,480
ballast wall like it takes half the day

2289
01:35:37,329 --> 01:35:42,159
sometimes Wow I spent honestly the first

2290
01:35:40,479 --> 01:35:43,869
half of my shift when I would walk into

2291
01:35:42,159 --> 01:35:46,029
the growth but the first hour would just

2292
01:35:43,869 --> 01:35:48,460
be making sure that none of the cloners

2293
01:35:46,029 --> 01:35:50,079
are clogged the sprinkler system is

2294
01:35:48,460 --> 01:35:51,670
clogged none of the pumps are clogged

2295
01:35:50,079 --> 01:35:54,760
none of the breakers have flipped all of

2296
01:35:51,670 --> 01:35:56,079
the fans are on all of the humidifiers

2297
01:35:54,760 --> 01:35:58,030
are running and none of the filters were

2298
01:35:56,079 --> 01:35:59,949
clogged up I would seriously spend an

2299
01:35:58,029 --> 01:36:03,009
hour checking all of that equipment just

2300
01:35:59,949 --> 01:36:04,569
like that I got a message back from a

2301
01:36:03,010 --> 01:36:06,670
buddy of mine maybe a month ago that

2302
01:36:04,569 --> 01:36:10,000
read can't talk after I said come on

2303
01:36:06,670 --> 01:36:11,500
this morning ouch it was just that $0.02

2304
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:16,239
way to let me know he can't talk right

2305
01:36:11,500 --> 01:36:18,789
now and he's gonna be busy yeah I mean

2306
01:36:16,239 --> 01:36:20,319
that's a game-changer that's your you've

2307
01:36:18,789 --> 01:36:22,359
got a half-million dollars and the fires

2308
01:36:20,319 --> 01:36:23,909
getting closer it's really uh it's

2309
01:36:22,359 --> 01:36:26,109
really neat in our industry we run

2310
01:36:23,909 --> 01:36:28,930
multimillion-dollar grow facilities that

2311
01:36:26,109 --> 01:36:31,329
are responsible for I'm not bragging on

2312
01:36:28,930 --> 01:36:32,770
Facebook by the owner of the facility I

2313
01:36:31,329 --> 01:36:34,779
was growing for posted one time that I

2314
01:36:32,770 --> 01:36:36,790
pulled three hundred and twenty

2315
01:36:34,779 --> 01:36:39,460
something and a fraction pounds of

2316
01:36:36,789 --> 01:36:47,470
cannabis from eighty five lights which

2317
01:36:39,460 --> 01:36:48,699
is three point something super light so

2318
01:36:47,470 --> 01:36:50,199
there's that much product being grown

2319
01:36:48,699 --> 01:36:52,510
three hundred and something pounds

2320
01:36:50,199 --> 01:36:53,769
somewhere between eighteen and twenty

2321
01:36:52,510 --> 01:36:54,940
two hundred dollars a pound proximately

2322
01:36:53,770 --> 01:36:57,430
two thousand dollars a pound

2323
01:36:54,939 --> 01:36:59,799
I had three hundred of them times two

2324
01:36:57,430 --> 01:37:02,079
thousand dollars I produced that uh and

2325
01:36:59,800 --> 01:37:04,600
we rely on like ten and twelve dollar

2326
01:37:02,079 --> 01:37:05,920
timers they could [ __ ] everything I find

2327
01:37:04,600 --> 01:37:07,360
it really funny that we've got like this

2328
01:37:05,920 --> 01:37:09,430
eight dollar timer from Lowe's that

2329
01:37:07,359 --> 01:37:11,229
makes all of this get fed if that one

2330
01:37:09,430 --> 01:37:14,730
timer [ __ ] up the whole facility does

2331
01:37:11,229 --> 01:37:17,259
not get water for a day in a basement

2332
01:37:14,729 --> 01:37:19,500
your timer screws up you don't notice if

2333
01:37:17,260 --> 01:37:23,969
the three days

2334
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:26,399
one growers out six thousand eight

2335
01:37:23,969 --> 01:37:29,399
thousand depending on how bad the

2336
01:37:26,399 --> 01:37:31,909
problem got before it got found same

2337
01:37:29,399 --> 01:37:34,948
thing happens in an industrial grow

2338
01:37:31,909 --> 01:37:36,359
someone's out several million in

2339
01:37:34,948 --> 01:37:37,738
everybody getting fired

2340
01:37:36,359 --> 01:37:39,929
yeah there's a whole dispensary that now

2341
01:37:37,738 --> 01:37:43,079
has to go buy retail weed well no and

2342
01:37:39,930 --> 01:37:44,670
take this a step further there's 365

2343
01:37:43,079 --> 01:37:46,260
days in the year and a [ __ ] load of

2344
01:37:44,670 --> 01:37:49,050
[ __ ] holidays you want to boot your

2345
01:37:46,260 --> 01:37:51,650
home with your family um somebody's got

2346
01:37:49,050 --> 01:37:55,469
to be at the grow every day to make sure

2347
01:37:51,649 --> 01:38:00,779
all your lights went off when I started

2348
01:37:55,469 --> 01:38:01,980
well this everybody episode but I no

2349
01:38:00,779 --> 01:38:03,000
longer work at green and healthy

2350
01:38:01,979 --> 01:38:04,409
wellness I'm not involved in a

2351
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:06,448
large-scale production facility at this

2352
01:38:04,409 --> 01:38:08,219
time I'm pursuing my own endeavors right

2353
01:38:06,448 --> 01:38:11,279
now but when I was in green and healthy

2354
01:38:08,219 --> 01:38:14,010
wellness for the first crop I did not

2355
01:38:11,279 --> 01:38:16,829
take a day off for the crowd the first

2356
01:38:14,010 --> 01:38:18,480
harvest was we were in flower for nine

2357
01:38:16,829 --> 01:38:20,909
or ten weeks there were some strains the

2358
01:38:18,479 --> 01:38:22,169
lemon Jie went for eleven weeks and then

2359
01:38:20,909 --> 01:38:26,149
there was a little bit of veg time

2360
01:38:22,170 --> 01:38:30,119
before that I did not take a day off for

2361
01:38:26,149 --> 01:38:33,389
79 or 80 four-ish days because somebody

2362
01:38:30,119 --> 01:38:35,939
had to be there so that's that I did not

2363
01:38:33,390 --> 01:38:38,010
expect but willing to do you can't be

2364
01:38:35,939 --> 01:38:40,049
even

2365
01:38:38,010 --> 01:38:41,579
tangentially involved with the legal

2366
01:38:40,050 --> 01:38:44,400
industry before the lazy stoner

2367
01:38:41,578 --> 01:38:47,069
stereotype evaporates I mean the amount

2368
01:38:44,399 --> 01:38:49,018
of work put in the industrial grows like

2369
01:38:47,069 --> 01:38:50,670
the legal industry in Colorado Colorado

2370
01:38:49,019 --> 01:38:54,030
we did a billion in sales last year

2371
01:38:50,670 --> 01:38:59,340
we're gonna do like 1.2 this year maybe

2372
01:38:54,029 --> 01:39:01,708
more the amount of days like 12 15 hour

2373
01:38:59,340 --> 01:39:04,860
days that people around the state put in

2374
01:39:01,708 --> 01:39:13,198
to make that true is just astronomical

2375
01:39:04,859 --> 01:39:14,969
can I spend a billion dollars okay you

2376
01:39:13,198 --> 01:39:16,529
could do this for minutes on drum gear

2377
01:39:14,969 --> 01:39:25,559
can I come to that party yeah I imagine

2378
01:39:16,529 --> 01:39:28,948
the drum kit I build just when you when

2379
01:39:25,559 --> 01:39:31,199
you make that step from from gray market

2380
01:39:28,948 --> 01:39:35,399
or the basement up into the legal

2381
01:39:31,198 --> 01:39:38,658
industry everything changes in ways that

2382
01:39:35,399 --> 01:39:41,670
you can't predict or imagine in I mean

2383
01:39:38,658 --> 01:39:43,228
this lucky you know that's going in we

2384
01:39:41,670 --> 01:39:44,940
learned this [ __ ] the hard way something

2385
01:39:43,229 --> 01:39:46,769
I gotta jump in and talk about it had

2386
01:39:44,939 --> 01:39:49,558
something I did not expect that was

2387
01:39:46,769 --> 01:39:51,539
overwhelming uh harvesting drying and

2388
01:39:49,559 --> 01:39:54,449
curing that's not [ __ ] prepared for

2389
01:39:51,538 --> 01:39:56,368
that you need space for however much bud

2390
01:39:54,448 --> 01:39:58,498
you've got growing you need that much

2391
01:39:56,368 --> 01:39:59,819
room for hanging buds basically yeah

2392
01:39:58,498 --> 01:40:02,569
because you can't just crush it all

2393
01:39:59,819 --> 01:40:04,738
together cuz it's gonna get funky

2394
01:40:02,569 --> 01:40:06,029
controlled room for drying and curing

2395
01:40:04,738 --> 01:40:08,038
that much herb that is something I

2396
01:40:06,029 --> 01:40:09,448
totally did not plan properly for when I

2397
01:40:08,038 --> 01:40:10,849
was a green and healthy wellness I've

2398
01:40:09,448 --> 01:40:14,669
seen people try to put a

2399
01:40:10,849 --> 01:40:23,130
football-field-sized grow room into a

2400
01:40:14,670 --> 01:40:24,690
bathroom sighs drying area where you

2401
01:40:23,130 --> 01:40:26,760
need somewhere for the freshly cut buds

2402
01:40:24,689 --> 01:40:28,678
to be for the older buds to be if you

2403
01:40:26,760 --> 01:40:30,809
need a drying and curing hanging

2404
01:40:28,679 --> 01:40:33,800
trimming system that is sufficient for

2405
01:40:30,809 --> 01:40:37,619
your space work on that the amount of

2406
01:40:33,800 --> 01:40:41,369
when you're doing any size grow the best

2407
01:40:37,618 --> 01:40:44,609
thing you can do to ensure success is to

2408
01:40:41,368 --> 01:40:46,348
plan upfront and when you're talking

2409
01:40:44,609 --> 01:40:50,409
about the size and scope and the legal

2410
01:40:46,349 --> 01:40:54,010
industry that's astronomically important

2411
01:40:50,409 --> 01:40:57,220
I've seen little little oversights lead

2412
01:40:54,010 --> 01:41:01,659
to multi-million dollar fuck-ups and

2413
01:40:57,220 --> 01:41:05,619
businesses collapse ah I mean just silly

2414
01:41:01,659 --> 01:41:07,300
stupid decisions or little things that

2415
01:41:05,619 --> 01:41:10,119
people overlook the cooling thing I've

2416
01:41:07,300 --> 01:41:12,640
seen multi-million dollar grows sit idle

2417
01:41:10,119 --> 01:41:16,180
half the year because there isn't

2418
01:41:12,640 --> 01:41:17,890
physically enough cooling on site to run

2419
01:41:16,180 --> 01:41:20,500
during the hottest months of the year

2420
01:41:17,890 --> 01:41:22,930
and the business just needs to make

2421
01:41:20,500 --> 01:41:24,939
another 300 grand before they can buy an

2422
01:41:22,930 --> 01:41:28,300
air conditioner big enough to cool their

2423
01:41:24,939 --> 01:41:30,399
home and dope like a Ferrari or a rocket

2424
01:41:28,300 --> 01:41:32,409
or a test but missing parts you just got

2425
01:41:30,399 --> 01:41:35,079
where I've seen other gross just say

2426
01:41:32,409 --> 01:41:37,180
[ __ ] it and grow when it's way too hot

2427
01:41:35,079 --> 01:41:39,819
and put out a super Airy product and

2428
01:41:37,180 --> 01:41:41,530
then they just so excited that the

2429
01:41:39,819 --> 01:41:43,269
winter is coming we get free air cooling

2430
01:41:41,529 --> 01:41:44,949
just filter that air that comes in - yes

2431
01:41:43,270 --> 01:41:46,270
you know you don't wanna bring in here

2432
01:41:44,949 --> 01:41:49,029
you don't wanna bring in hi scribbles

2433
01:41:46,270 --> 01:41:51,430
and fungus from outside but the

2434
01:41:49,029 --> 01:41:53,079
temperature swing in the the giant

2435
01:41:51,430 --> 01:41:55,110
concrete wall that you didn't think

2436
01:41:53,079 --> 01:41:57,609
about once while you were planning

2437
01:41:55,109 --> 01:41:59,500
causing massive powdery mildew and mold

2438
01:41:57,609 --> 01:42:01,329
growth because of the temperature swing

2439
01:41:59,500 --> 01:42:03,310
I mean how many people didn't see that

2440
01:42:01,329 --> 01:42:05,130
coming in their original plans right and

2441
01:42:03,310 --> 01:42:07,390
what are you gonna how do you heat a

2442
01:42:05,130 --> 01:42:08,949
foot and a half thick concrete move in

2443
01:42:07,390 --> 01:42:11,079
the one house that had a basement with

2444
01:42:08,949 --> 01:42:12,699
one concrete exterior wall and the first

2445
01:42:11,079 --> 01:42:15,100
time that I grew in that basement in the

2446
01:42:12,699 --> 01:42:16,989
winter guess what white rhino plant like

2447
01:42:15,100 --> 01:42:18,490
a 5-ounce plant it looked like a frosted

2448
01:42:16,989 --> 01:42:20,289
Christmas tree you got all funked up

2449
01:42:18,489 --> 01:42:24,039
with powdery mildew and went bye-bye

2450
01:42:20,289 --> 01:42:25,359
I I watched another guy his what he

2451
01:42:24,039 --> 01:42:27,810
thought were the best plants in the

2452
01:42:25,359 --> 01:42:30,369
harvest when we finally got back to him

2453
01:42:27,810 --> 01:42:33,310
the section of wall that they were up

2454
01:42:30,369 --> 01:42:35,349
against was ice-cold oh yeah and they

2455
01:42:33,310 --> 01:42:38,470
were I mean it was the craziest looking

2456
01:42:35,350 --> 01:42:40,060
pink mold I've ever seen but I mean just

2457
01:42:38,470 --> 01:42:41,770
found this it was because of the

2458
01:42:40,060 --> 01:42:44,950
temperature swing when you multiply that

2459
01:42:41,770 --> 01:42:47,140
I mean that was like maybe a $400 loss

2460
01:42:44,949 --> 01:42:49,269
to that grower but if that wasn't an

2461
01:42:47,140 --> 01:42:50,800
industrial setting gonna be 400,000 yeah

2462
01:42:49,270 --> 01:42:52,540
we just kept going right down that row

2463
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:53,710
all right so those are a lot of things

2464
01:42:52,539 --> 01:42:54,430
that you can look out for and you can

2465
01:42:53,710 --> 01:42:57,369
expect

2466
01:42:54,430 --> 01:42:59,500
he also said any other advice you could

2467
01:42:57,369 --> 01:43:02,559
you may think one would need knowing

2468
01:42:59,500 --> 01:43:04,599
about taking a leap into the big leagues

2469
01:43:02,559 --> 01:43:06,248
keep a positive attitude shits gonna

2470
01:43:04,599 --> 01:43:07,239
happen like I said every day you're

2471
01:43:06,248 --> 01:43:08,948
gonna walk into that girl you're gonna

2472
01:43:07,238 --> 01:43:10,388
find some [ __ ] and you can either

2473
01:43:08,948 --> 01:43:11,648
freak out you can throw your arms up in

2474
01:43:10,389 --> 01:43:13,059
the air and you'd be like what the [ __ ]

2475
01:43:11,649 --> 01:43:14,319
happen in here and you could kick some

2476
01:43:13,059 --> 01:43:16,239
buckets and you can throw some [ __ ]

2477
01:43:14,319 --> 01:43:18,179
around and make more of a mess or you go

2478
01:43:16,238 --> 01:43:20,618
get the [ __ ] mop you can mop it up

2479
01:43:18,179 --> 01:43:22,868
figure out where that pump bro could go

2480
01:43:20,618 --> 01:43:24,219
get some PVC pipe and a saw and fix all

2481
01:43:22,868 --> 01:43:25,538
that [ __ ] that you got to fix and just

2482
01:43:24,219 --> 01:43:27,760
put some glue on it hope it doesn't

2483
01:43:25,538 --> 01:43:29,828
break again because you still got work

2484
01:43:27,760 --> 01:43:31,479
to do plants need to be grown shits

2485
01:43:29,828 --> 01:43:32,978
gonna keep going so that's what I could

2486
01:43:31,479 --> 01:43:36,429
say keep a positive attitude keep your

2487
01:43:32,979 --> 01:43:38,168
head up also pay attention make sure you

2488
01:43:36,429 --> 01:43:40,328
get paid what you deserve to be paid and

2489
01:43:38,168 --> 01:43:43,148
if there's some [ __ ] in the grow that

2490
01:43:40,328 --> 01:43:44,858
can be done today do it don't wait until

2491
01:43:43,149 --> 01:43:47,050
tomorrow just [ __ ] do it

2492
01:43:44,859 --> 01:43:49,569
never in the growth I mean little things

2493
01:43:47,050 --> 01:43:51,458
that you can get away with it home I

2494
01:43:49,569 --> 01:43:54,010
mean sometimes four weeks at a time you

2495
01:43:51,458 --> 01:43:57,010
can get away with it all do not fly in

2496
01:43:54,010 --> 01:43:59,949
an industrial setting it's just so much

2497
01:43:57,010 --> 01:44:01,449
less room for error and things are gonna

2498
01:43:59,948 --> 01:44:03,188
stack up you're gonna think I've got

2499
01:44:01,448 --> 01:44:04,868

I've had a fairly uneventful week let's

2690
01:53:15,960 --> 01:53:30,869
talk about one thing that happened a

2691
01:53:22,250 --> 01:53:32,039
finger and I worked in the garden and I

2692
01:53:30,869 --> 01:53:33,449
think from working in the garden you

2693
01:53:32,039 --> 01:53:35,579
guys I got an infection in my fingernail

2694
01:53:33,449 --> 01:53:56,159
bed because I woke up one morning and my

2695
01:53:35,579 --> 01:53:58,170
finger was I was doing it I bought my

2696
01:53:56,159 --> 01:54:00,630
finger and a guardrail and when I hit on

2697
01:53:58,170 --> 01:54:04,680
the guardrail I let out a few really

2698
01:54:00,630 --> 01:54:05,909
prime words children not heard what I

2699
01:54:04,680 --> 01:54:07,680
said

2700
01:54:05,909 --> 01:54:10,050
that was I was prompted to go to the

2701
01:54:07,680 --> 01:54:11,190
hospital when I released those words so

2702
01:54:10,050 --> 01:54:14,430
I went to the hospital later that

2703
01:54:11,189 --> 01:54:17,759
evening I took them about less than an

2704
01:54:14,430 --> 01:54:20,700
hour to deal with my situation hospital

2705
01:54:17,760 --> 01:54:23,880
for like probably three hours a little

2706
01:54:20,699 --> 01:54:28,500
tiny infection on my ring finger on my

2707
01:54:23,880 --> 01:54:31,949
right hand on the right side there was a

2708
01:54:28,500 --> 01:54:33,300
little donkey swelled up it swelled up

2709
01:54:31,949 --> 01:54:34,619
and swelled up and turned purple you

2710
01:54:33,300 --> 01:54:36,600
guys it turned red and purple and it

2711
01:54:34,619 --> 01:54:41,220
hurt like you could barely touch it

2712
01:54:36,600 --> 01:54:43,920
without me screaming little infection we

2713
01:54:41,220 --> 01:54:46,890
can fix this what they did they gave me

2714
01:54:43,920 --> 01:54:49,199
a shot on the right side and the left

2715
01:54:46,890 --> 01:54:51,510
side of my finger right between the

2716
01:54:49,199 --> 01:54:54,179
first knuckle and like my hand like you

2717
01:54:51,510 --> 01:54:55,500
get your first knuckle or your finger

2718
01:54:54,180 --> 01:55:03,270
bands give me a shot between those two

2719
01:54:55,500 --> 01:55:04,619
on either side my finger my hand all the

2720
01:55:03,270 --> 01:55:06,390
pain was pretty much gone at that point

2721
01:55:04,619 --> 01:55:09,510
hurt like a son of a [ __ ] until then

2722
01:55:06,390 --> 01:55:11,010
and then once the numbing kicked in

2723
01:55:09,510 --> 01:55:12,900
pretty good the doctor came back in and

2724
01:55:11,010 --> 01:55:15,090
he took a scalpel and just cut a little

2725
01:55:12,899 --> 01:55:16,739
tiny like he made a plus sign just a

2726
01:55:15,090 --> 01:55:18,539
little plus sign so they did would open

2727
01:55:16,739 --> 01:55:21,510
up and then when he opened it you guys

2728
01:55:18,539 --> 01:55:22,560
it was just like and so I made a little

2729
01:55:21,510 --> 01:55:25,369
pop noise I don't know if the mic picked

2730
01:55:22,560 --> 01:55:27,200
it up but is it you could hear it

2731
01:55:25,369 --> 01:55:28,670
all kinds of [ __ ] came out of it and he

2732
01:55:27,199 --> 01:55:31,550
squeezed a bunch of stuff out of it

2733
01:55:28,670 --> 01:55:33,440
and uh oh you got so much stuff outta

2734
01:55:31,550 --> 01:55:34,369
there but I could feel almost as soon as

2735
01:55:33,439 --> 01:55:35,839
he cut it open

2736
01:55:34,369 --> 01:55:37,519
I could feel relief I could just feel

2737
01:55:35,840 --> 01:55:40,279
the pressure just come off of my skin

2738
01:55:37,520 --> 01:55:42,860
and off my fingers like oh it felt so

2739
01:55:40,279 --> 01:55:44,899
much better so he stuck a bunch of gauze

2740
01:55:42,859 --> 01:55:46,219
inside of there bunch of wadding to suck

2741
01:55:44,899 --> 01:55:48,019
up all the pus and goo that would be

2742
01:55:46,220 --> 01:55:49,640
coming out of my finger and then he

2743
01:55:48,020 --> 01:55:50,810
wrapped it up for a little bit I put

2744
01:55:49,640 --> 01:55:52,010
some medicine on there and wrapped it up

2745
01:55:50,810 --> 01:55:55,430
a little bit and he told me to change

2746
01:55:52,010 --> 01:55:57,230
that in 24 hours so 24 hours later I had

2747
01:55:55,430 --> 01:55:59,960
to take off the wrapping that he put on

2748
01:55:57,229 --> 01:56:01,819
it and had to pull that gauzy stuff out

2749
01:55:59,960 --> 01:56:03,319
of my finger you guys that was one of

2750
01:56:01,819 --> 01:56:05,299
the funkiest experiences ever there was

2751
01:56:03,319 --> 01:56:08,449
a lot of [ __ ] tucked into my finger holy

2752
01:56:05,300 --> 01:56:09,770
crap more medicine on there actually GB

2753
01:56:08,449 --> 01:56:11,269
helped me shout out to JB for helping me

2754
01:56:09,770 --> 01:56:14,660
do that she put some medicine on my

2755
01:56:11,270 --> 01:56:19,820
finger and then I rat we wrapped it up

2756
01:56:14,659 --> 01:56:22,819
again putting medicine on it about every

2757
01:56:19,819 --> 01:56:25,699
24 hours it's looking really good now

2758
01:56:22,819 --> 01:56:27,139
today it's been let's see I'm gonna

2759
01:56:25,699 --> 01:56:30,470
count days it's been four or five days

2760
01:56:27,140 --> 01:56:32,180
and it's basically fine by now there's a

2761
01:56:30,470 --> 01:56:33,020
little bit of scabbing on there it

2762
01:56:32,180 --> 01:56:35,060
doesn't bleed anymore

2763
01:56:33,020 --> 01:56:36,830
but they put me on these antibiotics you

2764
01:56:35,060 --> 01:56:38,690
guys these antibiotics make me feel so

2765
01:56:36,829 --> 01:56:40,550
terrible they make me nauseous this [ __ ]

2766
01:56:38,689 --> 01:56:41,779
gave me some stomach problems you don't

2767
01:56:40,550 --> 01:56:43,850
want to be around when I take these

2768
01:56:41,779 --> 01:56:46,399
things like two hours after I take them

2769
01:56:43,850 --> 01:56:47,600
I'm just miserable but I feel much

2770
01:56:46,399 --> 01:56:49,670
better my finger doesn't hurt anymore

2771
01:56:47,600 --> 01:56:51,440
I've only got a few more than about to

2772
01:56:49,670 --> 01:56:53,750
take this whole [ __ ] situation will

2773
01:56:51,439 --> 01:56:55,250
be over pretty soon so my guidance d

2774
01:56:53,750 --> 01:56:56,960
guys wear some rubber gloves when you're

2775
01:56:55,250 --> 01:56:58,430
working in the garden or be sure to wash

2776
01:56:56,960 --> 01:57:00,619
your hands really really well with some

2777
01:56:58,430 --> 01:57:02,390
antibacterial soap because I didn't do

2778
01:57:00,619 --> 01:57:03,920
either one of those apparently I don't

2779
01:57:02,390 --> 01:57:05,450
wear gloves unless I'm getting into some

2780
01:57:03,920 --> 01:57:07,819
[ __ ] that I know is gonna be funky

2781
01:57:05,449 --> 01:57:09,769
and I'm pretty sure that working in the

2782
01:57:07,819 --> 01:57:11,090
gardens did not help with this infection

2783
01:57:09,770 --> 01:57:14,300
I can't blame it on gardening but I'm

2784
01:57:11,090 --> 01:57:16,520
like 95% sure that this [ __ ] you should

2785
01:57:14,300 --> 01:57:18,710
have my fingernail came from working in

2786
01:57:16,520 --> 01:57:20,630
the garden so where are some gloves cut

2787
01:57:18,710 --> 01:57:22,880
your fingernails take care of your hands

2788
01:57:20,630 --> 01:57:24,619
I'm usually I'm if you know me like I do

2789
01:57:22,880 --> 01:57:26,510
have dreadlocks and I grow weed but I am

2790
01:57:24,619 --> 01:57:33,710
kind of seedy I am kind of a clean dude

2791
01:57:26,510 --> 01:57:34,940
I wash my hands constantly anybody has

2792
01:57:33,710 --> 01:57:35,359

2793
01:57:34,939 --> 01:57:37,039

2798
01:57:42,380 --> 01:57:45,470

2799
01:57:43,520 --> 01:57:47,060

2800
01:57:45,470 --> 01:57:49,310

2803
01:57:51,590 --> 01:57:54,590

2811
01:58:06,739 --> 01:58:11,689
weird why'd you do that to me you just

2812
01:58:08,989 --> 01:58:13,579
barely poked in kind of burns it hitched

2813
01:58:11,689 --> 01:58:14,989
like I wanted to reach over and scratch

2814
01:58:13,579 --> 01:58:16,460
it like I'm scratching my hand right now

2815
01:58:14,989 --> 01:58:17,989
just thinking about the feeling all

2816
01:58:16,460 --> 01:58:20,000
right guys I'm gonna get to the point of

2817
01:58:17,989 --> 01:58:23,149
this podcast there is a point I do have

2818
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:26,300
a purpose today it is the season you

2819

2822
01:58:30,229 --> 01:58:34,069
listener and he asked us oh this phone

2823
01:58:32,689 --> 01:58:35,509
is trying to make me update right now

2824
01:58:34,069 --> 01:58:37,009
and I don't want to update this is the

2825
01:58:35,510 --> 01:58:38,360
worst timing ever here we go the iPhone

2826
01:58:37,010 --> 01:58:43,180
wants me to update to the new operating

2827
01:58:38,359 --> 01:58:46,489
system I'm not ready to do it so it says

2828
01:58:43,180 --> 01:58:47,960
happy October and he says happy crop

2829
01:58:46,489 --> 01:58:49,789
sober Jeff then I'm gonna skip his name

2830
01:58:47,960 --> 01:58:51,590
he says my name is blank

2831
01:58:49,789 --> 01:58:53,239
he says I'm a longtime listener and have

2832
01:58:51,590 --> 01:58:55,699
used so much of your information here

2833
01:58:53,239 --> 01:58:58,130
legally in Michigan can you repost your

2834
01:58:55,699 --> 01:59:00,590
curing episode I figured tis the season

2835
01:58:58,130 --> 01:59:03,859
and I'm sure people could use a curing

2836
01:59:00,590 --> 01:59:05,239
refresher I'm absolutely going to give

2837
01:59:03,859 --> 01:59:07,219
you a cheering refresher I'm not gonna

2838
01:59:05,239 --> 01:59:08,539
repost the old episode feel like that

2839
01:59:07,220 --> 01:59:10,760
would be cheap I'm just gonna go ahead

2840
01:59:08,539 --> 01:59:13,489
and redo a fresh episode on how to cure

2841
01:59:10,760 --> 01:59:15,650
your freshly harvested buds before I get

2842

this email that was kind of just written

2844
01:59:16,909 --> 01:59:20,059

email thank you so let's get to the

2855
01:59:34,640 --> 01:59:38,810
point our friend asked us to do a

2856
01:59:36,949 --> 01:59:40,159
drawing and curing episode you guys my

2857
01:59:38,810 --> 01:59:41,600
throats already clogged up I feel like I

2858
01:59:40,159 --> 01:59:43,159
could use a DAB so I'm gonna press pause

2859
01:59:41,600 --> 01:59:44,690
for one second I'm gonna sip on some

2860
01:59:43,159 --> 01:59:46,309
frosty cold dr. pepper and I'm gonna

2861
01:59:44,689 --> 01:59:48,229
take a phat dab and when I get back

2862
01:59:46,310 --> 01:59:49,670
we're gonna do a quick lesson on drying

2863
01:59:48,229 --> 01:59:50,819
and curing your freshly harvested

2864
01:59:49,670 --> 01:59:53,880
cannabis

2865
01:59:50,819 --> 01:59:53,880
[Music]

2866
02:00:06,640 --> 02:00:11,490
all right you guys I'm freshly medicated

2867
02:00:08,829 --> 02:00:13,899
I am freshly hydrated let's talk about

2868
02:00:11,489 --> 02:00:18,250
drying and curing your freshly harvested

2869
02:00:13,899 --> 02:00:19,989
cannabis I'm super important that I know

2870
02:00:18,250 --> 02:00:23,199
I talk about a lot but I find it to be

2871
02:00:19,989 --> 02:00:25,210
really important about 14 10 to 14 days

2872
02:00:23,199 --> 02:00:27,579
before you plan on harvesting your

2873
02:00:25,210 --> 02:00:29,470
plants flush your plants it's free all

2874
02:00:27,579 --> 02:00:31,000
you need is clean water you're watering

2875
02:00:29,470 --> 02:00:33,820
your plants anyway or they're going to

2876
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:35,350
die so about 2 weeks before harvest time

2877
02:00:33,819 --> 02:00:37,479
and if you can't predict it that well 10

2878
02:00:35,350 --> 02:00:41,260
days is cool to try to go 10 full days

2879
02:00:37,479 --> 02:00:43,299
at minimum I'd rather go 10 to 14 14 is

2880
02:00:41,260 --> 02:00:44,710
what I prefer but if you're in cocoa ten

2881
02:00:43,300 --> 02:00:47,199
days is plenty if you're in some soil

2882
02:00:44,710 --> 02:00:50,409
soilless mix you're gonna want to go 14

2883
02:00:47,199 --> 02:00:52,449
days so what you got to do the first day

2884
02:00:50,409 --> 02:00:54,639
that you decide to flush just fill that

2885
02:00:52,449 --> 02:00:56,199
pot with get some if you really want to

2886
02:00:54,640 --> 02:00:57,760
ph the water you can if you got a small

2887
02:00:56,199 --> 02:00:59,829
crop phe but if you're using a large

2888
02:00:57,760 --> 02:01:01,420
crop like i run seven gallon pot so it

2889
02:00:59,829 --> 02:01:03,460
takes a lot of water to flush my plants

2890
02:01:01,420 --> 02:01:04,720
I don't pH all of that water to be on it

2891
02:01:03,460 --> 02:01:07,390
to be honest with you to tell you the

2892
02:01:04,720 --> 02:01:09,430
honest truth so what I do just fill up

2893
02:01:07,390 --> 02:01:11,079
your reservoir and water your plant

2894
02:01:09,430 --> 02:01:12,159
heavily a little more than usual it's

2895
02:01:11,079 --> 02:01:14,140
where you're getting a little extra

2896
02:01:12,159 --> 02:01:15,729
runoff like if you've got saucers

2897
02:01:14,140 --> 02:01:17,860
underneath your plants water until

2898
02:01:15,729 --> 02:01:19,750
there's runoff in those saucers for sure

2899
02:01:17,859 --> 02:01:21,339
like some extra more than usual you're

2900
02:01:19,750 --> 02:01:24,069
trying to wash that dirt out a little

2901
02:01:21,340 --> 02:01:26,529
bit so for the next ten to fourteen days

2902
02:01:24,069 --> 02:01:28,630
don't feed it anything but clean water

2903
02:01:26,529 --> 02:01:31,539
just water if you want a pH it go ahead

2904
02:01:28,630 --> 02:01:33,159
but just give it water clean those

2905
02:01:31,539 --> 02:01:35,949
plants out that's gonna make your plants

2906
02:01:33,159 --> 02:01:37,869
burn better they're gonna smoke better

2907
02:01:35,949 --> 02:01:40,000
they'll taste better your ashes will be

2908
02:01:37,869 --> 02:01:41,979
nice and white your joints will burn

2909
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:44,109
more smoothly have you ever gone to the

2910
02:01:41,979 --> 02:01:45,729
dispensary and bought weed and he grind

2911
02:01:44,109 --> 02:01:47,229
it up in the grinder and he starts

2912
02:01:45,729 --> 02:01:48,459
smoking it and your ashes burn and

2913
02:01:47,229 --> 02:01:49,750
they're kind of black and the joint

2914
02:01:48,460 --> 02:01:51,520
doesn't burn right and it tastes a

2915
02:01:49,750 --> 02:01:53,649
little funky that's because that

2916
02:01:51,520 --> 02:01:56,110
cannabis was probably not flushed

2917
02:01:53,649 --> 02:01:57,399
properly and it still got funky [ __ ] in

2918
02:01:56,109 --> 02:01:59,139
it that you don't really want to smoke

2919
02:01:57,399 --> 02:02:01,389
and it could have been a lot better

2920
02:01:59,140 --> 02:02:03,010
had it been flushed it also probably

2921
02:02:01,390 --> 02:02:05,829
could have been better had it been

2922
02:02:03,010 --> 02:02:07,210
trimmed and cured dried and cured

2923
02:02:05,829 --> 02:02:10,479
properly so we're gonna get to that

2924
02:02:07,210 --> 02:02:12,340
point so flush your plants it's free and

2925
02:02:10,479 --> 02:02:14,259
it's so frustrating that people will

2926
02:02:12,340 --> 02:02:17,350
spend so long on plants and then they

2927
02:02:14,260 --> 02:02:19,150
don't flush properly you get 14 days of

2928
02:02:17,350 --> 02:02:19,800
not having to spend money on nutrients

2929
02:02:19,149 --> 02:02:21,868
and

2930
02:02:19,800 --> 02:02:24,059
just water you're gonna water anyway so

2931
02:02:21,868 --> 02:02:25,558
water heavily let them dry out when they

2932
02:02:24,059 --> 02:02:27,150
get a little bit dry you'll see them

2933
02:02:25,559 --> 02:02:29,159
when the leaves start going warm you can

2934
02:02:27,149 --> 02:02:30,960
see them do it all over again water the

2935
02:02:29,158 --> 02:02:33,179
[ __ ] out of them and do that for the

2936
02:02:30,960 --> 02:02:35,189
next 14 days let them water them dry

2937
02:02:33,179 --> 02:02:38,279
them water and dry them you should be

2938
02:02:35,189 --> 02:02:40,469
able to get at least four good flush

2939
02:02:38,279 --> 02:02:42,389
cycles in there like the first day the

2940
02:02:40,469 --> 02:02:44,639
big heavy one on the first day of the

2941
02:02:42,389 --> 02:02:46,590
two-week cycle but maybe Monday Thursday

2942
02:02:44,639 --> 02:02:47,880
Monday and Thursday that's four good

2943
02:02:46,590 --> 02:02:49,500
waters that you can get in there and

2944
02:02:47,880 --> 02:02:51,510
then I like to actually let the plants

2945
02:02:49,500 --> 02:02:53,429
dry out a little bit before I harvest

2946
02:02:51,510 --> 02:02:54,780
them so beef right before you harvest

2947
02:02:53,429 --> 02:02:55,469
just kind of just let them chill out let

2948
02:02:54,779 --> 02:02:56,969
them dry a little bit

2949
02:02:55,469 --> 02:03:00,118
so flush your plants that's super

2950
02:02:56,969 --> 02:03:02,460
important then a few days before harvest

2951
02:03:00,118 --> 02:03:04,500
maybe two or three days before harvest I

2952
02:03:02,460 --> 02:03:06,809
like to go in there and take off all of

2953
02:03:04,500 --> 02:03:08,488
the large leaves the leaves that are

2954
02:03:06,809 --> 02:03:10,320
just gonna end up being thrown away or

2955
02:03:08,488 --> 02:03:12,000
that are in the way if they've got a

2956
02:03:10,319 --> 02:03:13,799
large pea deol and I can get to them and

2957
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:15,479
they'll have resin on them I will cut

2958
02:03:13,800 --> 02:03:16,529
those leaves off now while the plants

2959
02:03:15,479 --> 02:03:18,629
are standing and they're healthy and

2960
02:03:16,529 --> 02:03:21,840
those leaves are sticking out I cut all

2961
02:03:18,630 --> 02:03:24,809
those leaves off this makes harvesting

2962
02:03:21,840 --> 02:03:26,849
so much easier when it comes down to

2963
02:03:24,809 --> 02:03:28,440
cutting down the entire plant you don't

2964
02:03:26,849 --> 02:03:30,360
have all those leaves hanging in the way

2965
02:03:28,439 --> 02:03:31,558
you've already gotten rid of them and

2966
02:03:30,359 --> 02:03:34,049
you're a step ahead of yourself because

2967
02:03:31,559 --> 02:03:36,179
harvest can get overwhelming if you've

2968
02:03:34,050 --> 02:03:38,340
got one light if you've got four lights

2969
02:03:36,179 --> 02:03:40,020
if you've got ten lights it will get

2970
02:03:38,340 --> 02:03:41,489
overwhelming even with that one light

2971
02:03:40,020 --> 02:03:43,469
that one pound of weed is gonna take you

2972
02:03:41,488 --> 02:03:45,899
if it's your first harvest you're gonna

2973
02:03:43,469 --> 02:03:47,578
be sticky you're gonna it's gonna be

2974
02:03:45,899 --> 02:03:48,689
overwhelming so cut off those extra

2975
02:03:47,578 --> 02:03:50,519
leaves they're just gonna be in the way

2976
02:03:48,689 --> 02:03:51,750
they're gonna end up on the floor the

2977
02:03:50,520 --> 02:03:54,300
plants are gonna be just fine without

2978
02:03:51,750 --> 02:03:55,738
those leaves for a couple of days if

2979
02:03:54,300 --> 02:03:58,349
you're one of the growers that does the

2980
02:03:55,738 --> 02:04:00,718
extended dark period like 24 or 48 hours

2981
02:03:58,349 --> 02:04:02,460
of darkness before harvest chop all

2982
02:04:00,719 --> 02:04:04,050
these extra leaves off right before you

2983
02:04:02,460 --> 02:04:06,539
do the dark phase and it'll really

2984
02:04:04,050 --> 02:04:07,650
increase what you're doing if you don't

2985
02:04:06,539 --> 02:04:10,139
know what I'm talking about you guys a

2986
02:04:07,649 --> 02:04:11,670
lot of people a lot of growers and this

2987
02:04:10,139 --> 02:04:12,750
is up to you and it's up to your strain

2988
02:04:11,670 --> 02:04:14,670
it's more up to the plants you're

2989
02:04:12,750 --> 02:04:16,738
growing certain strains love it some

2990
02:04:14,670 --> 02:04:19,770
strains [ __ ] hate it so I like

2991
02:04:16,738 --> 02:04:21,419
blueberry and Flo really love it some

2992
02:04:19,770 --> 02:04:22,980
Silver Haze varietal I tried it with

2993
02:04:21,420 --> 02:04:24,359
hated it lemon Geoffrey doesn't seem to

2994
02:04:22,979 --> 02:04:28,019
approve it so what a lot of people do

2995
02:04:24,359 --> 02:04:29,848
they will take a plant and 24 to 48

2996
02:04:28,020 --> 02:04:31,739
hours before harvest they will put it in

2997
02:04:29,849 --> 02:04:34,078
total darkness and let it sit in the

2998
02:04:31,738 --> 02:04:35,819
darkness and this plan this puts the

2999
02:04:34,078 --> 02:04:38,099
plant on panic mode and it basically

3000
02:04:35,819 --> 02:04:39,389
makes it finish more quickly it'll kind

3001
02:04:38,099 --> 02:04:42,029
of bulk up a little bit it'll start

3002
02:04:39,389 --> 02:04:43,889
using the last of its energy what would

3003
02:04:42,029 --> 02:04:46,288
you do if the Sun didn't come up you

3004
02:04:43,889 --> 02:04:48,239
would kind of freak out that plants

3005
02:04:46,288 --> 02:04:50,248
whole purpose in life is to reproduce

3006
02:04:48,238 --> 02:04:52,948
that plants goal is to get pollinated

3007
02:04:50,248 --> 02:04:54,658
make seeds and die so that those seeds

3008
02:04:52,948 --> 02:04:57,089
fall on the ground and grow again it

3009
02:04:54,658 --> 02:04:58,979
just wants to reproduce what its job is

3010
02:04:57,090 --> 02:05:00,630
to do that is to swell up to get bigger

3011
02:04:58,979 --> 02:05:02,038
so that it can receive more pollen it's

3012
02:05:00,630 --> 02:05:03,690
freaking out it's like I better get some

3013
02:05:02,038 --> 02:05:05,488
pollen soon cuz I'm gonna die

3014
02:05:03,689 --> 02:05:07,529
so it starts swelling up it starts

3015
02:05:05,488 --> 02:05:09,689
getting bigger and you'll get a little

3016
02:05:07,529 --> 02:05:11,939
more density and a little more resin

3017
02:05:09,689 --> 02:05:13,348
production I'm not certain how true the

3018
02:05:11,939 --> 02:05:15,689
resin production is but I've seen more

3019
02:05:13,349 --> 02:05:17,550
density I've seen it happen if you put

3020
02:05:15,689 --> 02:05:19,408
it in there for like 36 48 hours you'll

3021
02:05:17,550 --> 02:05:21,210
get a little production but it's strain

3022
02:05:19,408 --> 02:05:24,029
dependant the more indica dominant

3023
02:05:21,210 --> 02:05:25,859
strains will like this better so take

3024
02:05:24,029 --> 02:05:27,359
off the big leaves you can throw in the

3025
02:05:25,859 --> 02:05:28,558
dark if you want to that's up to you

3026
02:05:27,359 --> 02:05:30,299
that's up to your plants it's up to your

3027
02:05:28,559 --> 02:05:31,800
situation we can't do that in the large

3028
02:05:30,300 --> 02:05:33,748
cultivation facility because we're

3029
02:05:31,800 --> 02:05:35,038
running a perpetual grow and so we've

3030
02:05:33,748 --> 02:05:36,420
just always got the twelve twelve

3031
02:05:35,038 --> 02:05:38,578
happening because it's easier that way

3032
02:05:36,420 --> 02:05:40,050
and I prefer the twelve twelve over the

3033
02:05:38,578 --> 02:05:41,908
eleven thirteen that we've talked about

3034
02:05:40,050 --> 02:05:44,880
on the show we've talked about running

3035
02:05:41,908 --> 02:05:46,859
your lights on eleven on and thirteen

3036
02:05:44,880 --> 02:05:49,618
off because it does show a little better

3037
02:05:46,859 --> 02:05:53,038
phenotypic expression in a Fino hut and

3038
02:05:49,618 --> 02:05:55,618
it will also save you I guess if you're

3039
02:05:53,038 --> 02:05:57,748
running for 63 days a nine week flower

3040
02:05:55,618 --> 02:05:59,038
cycle that's sixty three hours of lights

3041
02:05:57,748 --> 02:06:01,979
that you're gonna save that you don't

3042
02:05:59,038 --> 02:06:05,038
have to pay for electricity cooling and

3043
02:06:01,979 --> 02:06:07,169
also your gear doesn't get used that

3044
02:06:05,038 --> 02:06:09,359
extra time so you're gonna save that

3045
02:06:07,170 --> 02:06:11,219
much mileage so you want to do that

3046
02:06:09,359 --> 02:06:11,880
networks too so let me get back to where

3047
02:06:11,219 --> 02:06:13,679
we are

3048
02:06:11,880 --> 02:06:16,319
take off the big leaves you don't want

3049
02:06:13,679 --> 02:06:18,719
those in the way let the plants stay in

3050
02:06:16,319 --> 02:06:21,149
the dark if you want to now it's time to

3051
02:06:18,719 --> 02:06:22,590
harvest so if you have little plans you

3052
02:06:21,149 --> 02:06:24,509
can chop down the whole thing if you

3053
02:06:22,590 --> 02:06:26,849
have larger plants it's probably easier

3054
02:06:24,510 --> 02:06:29,670
to cut it down in sections so what I do

3055
02:06:26,849 --> 02:06:32,340
I honestly use a coat hanger and I will

3056
02:06:29,670 --> 02:06:34,050
take a large plant and I will go from

3057
02:06:32,340 --> 02:06:36,328
the top cola I will start from the top

3058
02:06:34,050 --> 02:06:37,739
and work my way down and what I do I go

3059
02:06:36,328 --> 02:06:40,380
from the top and I usually try to cut

3060
02:06:37,738 --> 02:06:43,018
off about maybe somewhere between eight

3061
02:06:40,380 --> 02:06:44,699
and twelve inch long sections so I'll

3062
02:06:43,019 --> 02:06:46,229
take the top cola

3063
02:06:44,698 --> 02:06:48,148
and I'll go down to where I can find the

3064
02:06:46,229 --> 02:06:50,010
first little branch of nodes that I

3065
02:06:48,149 --> 02:06:52,889
think will support that and I cut below

3066
02:06:50,010 --> 02:06:55,559
that tour I can use that branching as

3067
02:06:52,889 --> 02:06:57,208
its own hangar I will cut the bud and

3068
02:06:55,559 --> 02:06:58,949
then it will hang it upside down on the

3069
02:06:57,208 --> 02:07:00,300
coat hanger that I plan to use and I

3070
02:06:58,948 --> 02:07:01,888
hang that coat hanger somewhere else

3071
02:07:00,300 --> 02:07:03,929
I've got a drying area that's got little

3072
02:07:01,889 --> 02:07:05,340
racks for a coat hanger you can hang it

3073
02:07:03,929 --> 02:07:06,510
wherever works best for you we'll talk

3074
02:07:05,340 --> 02:07:08,939
about the temperature of the humidity

3075
02:07:06,510 --> 02:07:10,380
here in just a few minutes so you cut

3076
02:07:08,939 --> 02:07:12,418
your buds you hang them on a coat hanger

3077
02:07:10,380 --> 02:07:14,399
you continue to work your way down the

3078
02:07:12,418 --> 02:07:15,748
plant you've now you've got a couple of

3079
02:07:14,399 --> 02:07:17,369
V's sticking off and you'll start seeing

3080
02:07:15,748 --> 02:07:19,109
these little V's intersections they'll

3081
02:07:17,368 --> 02:07:21,118
just come naturally go down the plant

3082
02:07:19,109 --> 02:07:22,618
cut a couple of those so you chop one

3083
02:07:21,118 --> 02:07:24,929
hang it up chop another one hang it up

3084
02:07:22,618 --> 02:07:26,908
til you got your hanger fool leave

3085
02:07:24,929 --> 02:07:29,788
plenty of space on these hangers only

3086
02:07:26,908 --> 02:07:31,708
put let's see one two three four maybe

3087
02:07:29,788 --> 02:07:33,389
put like seven or eight maybe not a

3088
02:07:31,708 --> 02:07:35,099
whole lot of stuff stuff together on

3089
02:07:33,389 --> 02:07:36,719
these hangers you want some airflow you

3090
02:07:35,099 --> 02:07:37,918
want air to be able to get between your

3091
02:07:36,719 --> 02:07:39,929
buds that's how they're gonna dry

3092
02:07:37,918 --> 02:07:41,908
properly so put them on those hangers

3093
02:07:39,929 --> 02:07:43,349
and hang them somewhere now let's talk

3094
02:07:41,908 --> 02:07:44,848
about where to hang the plants and then

3095
02:07:43,349 --> 02:07:46,559
we're gonna talk about wet trimming and

3096
02:07:44,849 --> 02:07:48,599
dry trimming because that's what's next

3097
02:07:46,559 --> 02:07:52,079
you want to ideally hang these plants

3098
02:07:48,599 --> 02:07:54,360
any room that is approximately 65 to 75

3099
02:07:52,078 --> 02:07:57,868
degrees you also want to have

3100
02:07:54,359 --> 02:07:59,848
approximately 45 to 55 percent humidity

3101
02:07:57,868 --> 02:08:01,799
in that room you may need an air

3102
02:07:59,849 --> 02:08:04,019
conditioner you may need a heater you

3103
02:08:01,800 --> 02:08:06,090
may need a dehumidifier or you may need

3104
02:08:04,019 --> 02:08:07,708
a humidifier in there those are things

3105
02:08:06,090 --> 02:08:11,279
that you may need to properly dry and

3106
02:08:07,708 --> 02:08:14,849
cure this product to be top shelf 100%

3107
02:08:11,279 --> 02:08:16,288
grade a dried and cured cannabis so you

3108
02:08:14,849 --> 02:08:18,779
may need a dehumidifier if you're in

3109
02:08:16,288 --> 02:08:21,090
Colorado you need a humidifier it gets

3110
02:08:18,779 --> 02:08:23,130
so dry here so quickly that our buds dry

3111
02:08:21,090 --> 02:08:24,479
in like four days people make fun of us

3112
02:08:23,130 --> 02:08:26,458
they call our dispensary weed the

3113
02:08:24,479 --> 02:08:29,519
Colorado crunch because it is crunchy by

3114
02:08:26,458 --> 02:08:31,050
the time it gets to you i gets grown it

3115
02:08:29,519 --> 02:08:32,939
gets trimmed up by a trim crew it gets

3116
02:08:31,050 --> 02:08:34,829
dried and cured it's put in a bag it

3117
02:08:32,939 --> 02:08:37,199
gets into a dispensary gets put in a jar

3118
02:08:34,828 --> 02:08:39,148
the jar gets open and closed all day

3119
02:08:37,198 --> 02:08:41,638
every day but by the time it gets to you

3120
02:08:39,149 --> 02:08:43,619
guys it is just super crunchy the way to

3121
02:08:41,639 --> 02:08:45,328
prevent that is to dry it nice and

3122
02:08:43,618 --> 02:08:46,918
slowly it will retain some of that

3123
02:08:45,328 --> 02:08:48,988
moisture it'll retain some of that

3124
02:08:46,918 --> 02:08:50,729
stickiness and it'll still be dense and

3125
02:08:48,988 --> 02:08:53,938
flavorful and it'll still burn properly

3126
02:08:50,729 --> 02:08:57,300
so you want your drying area to be 65 to

3127
02:08:53,939 --> 02:08:58,289
75 degrees 45 to 55 percent humidity we

3128
02:08:57,300 --> 02:09:01,100
also

3129
02:08:58,289 --> 02:09:04,260
it dark in there you want it to be dark

3130
02:09:01,100 --> 02:09:06,360
light degrades trichomes a light breaks

3131
02:09:04,260 --> 02:09:09,150
down THC light is not what you want you

3132
02:09:06,359 --> 02:09:10,799
want it darken there also you would like

3133
02:09:09,149 --> 02:09:12,329
to have a fan in there have some air

3134
02:09:10,800 --> 02:09:14,789
circulation you don't want to leave that

3135
02:09:12,329 --> 02:09:16,109
old air sitting on the buds you want at

3136
02:09:14,789 --> 02:09:18,659
least move the air around if you can

3137
02:09:16,109 --> 02:09:20,849
have a blower blowing air out of the

3138
02:09:18,659 --> 02:09:22,739
room and exchanging the air having fresh

3139
02:09:20,850 --> 02:09:25,140
air coming in and old air going out that

3140
02:09:22,739 --> 02:09:26,579
would be ideal I understand we don't all

3141
02:09:25,140 --> 02:09:28,860
have that type of stuff so if you're

3142
02:09:26,579 --> 02:09:31,619
using a closet or whatever make sure you

3143
02:09:28,859 --> 02:09:34,769
open it the water that comes out of your

3144
02:09:31,619 --> 02:09:36,359
buds is water that needs to go into that

3145
02:09:34,770 --> 02:09:37,650
will go into the air and that's just

3146
02:09:36,359 --> 02:09:39,029
gonna be trapped in the closet you're

3147
02:09:37,649 --> 02:09:40,500
just gonna raise the humidity in your

3148
02:09:39,029 --> 02:09:42,630
closet it's got to come out of there so

3149
02:09:40,500 --> 02:09:43,979
open that door occasionally the more

3150
02:09:42,630 --> 02:09:45,750
buds you have tucked in the space the

3151
02:09:43,979 --> 02:09:47,699
more moisture there will be the more

3152
02:09:45,750 --> 02:09:49,199
water you fed the plants right before

3153
02:09:47,699 --> 02:09:50,849
harvest time the more moisture there

3154
02:09:49,199 --> 02:09:52,619
will be so make sure you're getting rid

3155
02:09:50,850 --> 02:09:54,960
of the moisture in that room also a good

3156
02:09:52,619 --> 02:09:56,699
idea you guys would be a carbon filter

3157
02:09:54,960 --> 02:09:58,859
if you can put a carbon filter and a

3158
02:09:56,699 --> 02:09:59,639
blower in your drying area it would

3159
02:09:58,859 --> 02:10:01,979
really help you out

3160
02:09:59,640 --> 02:10:04,140
it would minimize the smell it would

3161
02:10:01,979 --> 02:10:06,149
help keep you discreet a lot of people

3162
02:10:04,140 --> 02:10:08,190
are gonna make concentrates out of their

3163
02:10:06,149 --> 02:10:09,689
buds so a carbon filter would also help

3164
02:10:08,189 --> 02:10:11,399
you keep dust and contaminants out of

3165
02:10:09,689 --> 02:10:13,710
the room one thing that I see a lot of

3166
02:10:11,399 --> 02:10:15,509
people do they actually use the hut if

3167
02:10:13,710 --> 02:10:17,159
you're growing in a hydro Hut or a small

3168
02:10:15,510 --> 02:10:18,510
room you can use that room as you're

3169
02:10:17,159 --> 02:10:19,859
drying in carrying space you should

3170
02:10:18,510 --> 02:10:21,270
already have a blower in there you

3171
02:10:19,859 --> 02:10:23,609
should already have climate controls in

3172
02:10:21,270 --> 02:10:26,220
there I know people that have actually

3173
02:10:23,609 --> 02:10:28,769
purchased specific three by three or

3174
02:10:26,220 --> 02:10:30,270
five by five grow tins and they don't

3175
02:10:28,770 --> 02:10:31,950
put a light in it but they do put the

3176
02:10:30,270 --> 02:10:33,390
blower up top and they put a little fan

3177
02:10:31,949 --> 02:10:35,220
in there and then they just hang the

3178
02:10:33,390 --> 02:10:36,840
plants upside down in there so they've

3179
02:10:35,220 --> 02:10:38,280
got one that's one hunt that's being

3180
02:10:36,840 --> 02:10:40,650
harvested all the time they've got a

3181
02:10:38,279 --> 02:10:42,659
perpetual groats where like every 2 or 4

3182
02:10:40,649 --> 02:10:44,309
weeks one of their huts comes down and

3183
02:10:42,659 --> 02:10:46,019
then it goes into bat hunt which is

3184
02:10:44,310 --> 02:10:47,820
actually part of their flow it goes into

3185
02:10:46,020 --> 02:10:50,000
this other hunt which is they're drying

3186
02:10:47,819 --> 02:10:52,529
Hut so those girl huts are good for that

3187
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:54,149
so you want a room that's very well

3188
02:10:52,529 --> 02:10:56,099
controlled if you can I understand

3189
02:10:54,149 --> 02:10:58,139
that's not always possible for everybody

3190
02:10:56,100 --> 02:10:59,970
I said we would talk about wet trimming

3191
02:10:58,140 --> 02:11:01,260
and dry trimming you've chopped down

3192
02:10:59,970 --> 02:11:03,210
your plant you've got it on these coat

3193
02:11:01,260 --> 02:11:05,190
hangers you've got it hang it up in a

3194
02:11:03,210 --> 02:11:07,020
place now you can decide do I want a wet

3195
02:11:05,189 --> 02:11:09,419
trim this stuff or do I want to dry trim

3196
02:11:07,020 --> 02:11:11,190
it there are benefits to both you get

3197
02:11:09,420 --> 02:11:11,590
super sticky it makes a hell of a mess

3198
02:11:11,189 --> 02:11:13,299
and it

3199
02:11:11,590 --> 02:11:15,250
takes a long time to wet trim I think

3200
02:11:13,300 --> 02:11:16,659
what trimming takes longer you may be

3201
02:11:15,250 --> 02:11:19,479
able to do a little bit neater of the

3202
02:11:16,658 --> 02:11:21,069
trim but in my opinion opinion I am

3203
02:11:19,479 --> 02:11:25,479
better at a dry trim and I think it's

3204
02:11:21,069 --> 02:11:27,639
more time time efficient so wet trim

3205
02:11:25,479 --> 02:11:29,529
take those buds that are hanging on the

3206
02:11:27,639 --> 02:11:31,270
hanger take them off the hanger trim

3207
02:11:29,529 --> 02:11:32,769
them up leave them on the hanger or

3208
02:11:31,270 --> 02:11:34,150
leave them on the stick don't cut the

3209
02:11:32,770 --> 02:11:35,679
buds off the stick just trim up all

3210
02:11:34,149 --> 02:11:37,210
those leaves all those funky leaves that

3211
02:11:35,679 --> 02:11:39,099
are sticking off trim them real close to

3212
02:11:37,210 --> 02:11:41,020
the buds when they dry its gonna look

3213
02:11:39,099 --> 02:11:42,550
even tighter those little little tiny

3214
02:11:41,020 --> 02:11:43,900
pieces you can't get you those will sink

3215
02:11:42,550 --> 02:11:45,219
into the bud those will disappear when

3216
02:11:43,899 --> 02:11:46,719
it dries up you won't be able to tell

3217
02:11:45,219 --> 02:11:49,599
they're there put them back on the

3218
02:11:46,719 --> 02:11:52,300
hanger hang them up your drying dry area

3219
02:11:49,599 --> 02:11:54,940
and leave them there until the sticks

3220
02:11:52,300 --> 02:11:56,980
snap now if you want to do a dry trim

3221
02:11:54,939 --> 02:11:58,149
those plants that you've cut down and

3222
02:11:56,979 --> 02:12:00,609
you've got them got them on the hanger

3223
02:11:58,149 --> 02:12:02,319
just leave them in your drying area and

3224
02:12:00,609 --> 02:12:04,719
tell the stick snap and once the sticks

3225
02:12:02,319 --> 02:12:06,939
snap that's when we catch up with your

3226
02:12:04,719 --> 02:12:08,679
white trim and dry trim so I keep saying

3227
02:12:06,939 --> 02:12:10,029
when the sticks snap and I'm sure some

3228
02:12:08,679 --> 02:12:12,399
people are saying what does that mean

3229
02:12:10,029 --> 02:12:14,139
you've got your plants they've been cut

3230
02:12:12,399 --> 02:12:16,569
down they're hanging upside down they've

3231
02:12:14,139 --> 02:12:18,069
either been wet trimmed tore now you've

3232
02:12:16,569 --> 02:12:19,479
just got beautiful branches with

3233
02:12:18,069 --> 02:12:20,819
beautiful buds hanging off of them

3234
02:12:19,479 --> 02:12:23,829
hanging on a hanger in your

3235
02:12:20,819 --> 02:12:25,599
climate-controlled area or you've got

3236
02:12:23,829 --> 02:12:26,738
these furry looking plants with just the

3237
02:12:25,599 --> 02:12:28,510
little leaves left on them because

3238
02:12:26,738 --> 02:12:30,488
earlier it pre harvest we cut off all

3239
02:12:28,510 --> 02:12:32,289
the big leaves so you got these plants

3240
02:12:30,488 --> 02:12:33,819
and they've just got little fuzzy leaves

3241
02:12:32,289 --> 02:12:35,710
they need a haircut hanging off of those

3242
02:12:33,819 --> 02:12:38,319
those are hanging up in your dry area

3243
02:12:35,710 --> 02:12:40,300
now every about 12 hours I would

3244
02:12:38,319 --> 02:12:41,889
recommend go to those plants and pick a

3245
02:12:40,300 --> 02:12:43,570
branch and does it give it a bend

3246
02:12:41,889 --> 02:12:45,340
now at first you're gonna feel those

3247
02:12:43,569 --> 02:12:47,229
plants just bend they're real flexible

3248
02:12:45,340 --> 02:12:48,489
they're not gonna pop they're not gonna

3249
02:12:47,229 --> 02:12:50,439
break they're just gonna bend and it's

3250
02:12:48,488 --> 02:12:52,959
gonna be real flexi it's not gonna cause

3251
02:12:50,439 --> 02:12:54,460
any problems over time you'll notice

3252
02:12:52,960 --> 02:12:57,250
that those branches become a little more

3253
02:12:54,460 --> 02:12:59,590
brittle and a little harder eventually

3254
02:12:57,250 --> 02:13:01,779
those branches are going to snap when

3255
02:12:59,590 --> 02:13:03,429
you bend them the thicker ones are gonna

3256
02:13:01,779 --> 02:13:05,198
take a little longer the thinner ones

3257
02:13:03,429 --> 02:13:06,880
are gonna go a little sooner so pay

3258
02:13:05,198 --> 02:13:09,669
attention maybe check two or three buds

3259
02:13:06,880 --> 02:13:11,618
every time you check when he gets close

3260
02:13:09,670 --> 02:13:12,969
don't pay attendant worry too much at

3261
02:13:11,618 --> 02:13:14,500
the beginning but once you get closer

3262
02:13:12,969 --> 02:13:17,139
start paying more attention to this

3263
02:13:14,500 --> 02:13:19,118
different size buds and then once you

3264
02:13:17,139 --> 02:13:21,730
feel those simms pop once you bend it

3265
02:13:19,118 --> 02:13:23,408
and it goes click or pop or crunch you

3266
02:13:21,729 --> 02:13:24,959
will know it when you feel it the first

3267
02:13:23,408 --> 02:13:27,119
time you go that's what

3268
02:13:24,960 --> 02:13:29,100
that's when it is time if you've got

3269
02:13:27,119 --> 02:13:31,319
trimmed buds that are already trimmed

3270
02:13:29,100 --> 02:13:33,120
that's when it's time to pop those buds

3271
02:13:31,319 --> 02:13:35,579
off of the sticks and we'll start the

3272
02:13:33,119 --> 02:13:37,769
curing process there if you have got

3273
02:13:35,579 --> 02:13:39,779
buds that we're going to be dry trimmed

3274
02:13:37,770 --> 02:13:41,400
it now is the time to dry trim those and

3275
02:13:39,779 --> 02:13:43,769
we'll talk about that a little bit

3276
02:13:41,399 --> 02:13:45,119
all right dry trimming you've got your

3277
02:13:43,770 --> 02:13:46,680
buds they're hanging on the hanger and

3278
02:13:45,119 --> 02:13:48,239
they're a little bit furry so you just

3279
02:13:46,680 --> 02:13:52,230
take a butt off to take a branch off the

3280
02:13:48,239 --> 02:13:53,819
hanger and you can cut these buds off of

3281
02:13:52,229 --> 02:13:56,039
the sticks because they are about to go

3282
02:13:53,819 --> 02:13:57,569
into the curing bin so you don't have to

3283
02:13:56,039 --> 02:14:00,329
worry about hanging them up anymore

3284
02:13:57,569 --> 02:14:02,789
if the buds pop it is fine to take them

3285
02:14:00,329 --> 02:14:05,340
off the stick yes so you've got your

3286
02:14:02,789 --> 02:14:06,840
buds the stems pop you can take those

3287
02:14:05,340 --> 02:14:08,279
down and if it's easier for you to trim

3288
02:14:06,840 --> 02:14:10,800
it while it's on the stick go for it if

3289
02:14:08,279 --> 02:14:12,689
it's easier for you to trim it after you

3290
02:14:10,800 --> 02:14:14,520
cut it off the stick go for it in my

3291
02:14:12,689 --> 02:14:15,960
opinion although I am NOT your trim boss

3292
02:14:14,520 --> 02:14:17,160
this is for your garden if you're

3293
02:14:15,960 --> 02:14:18,930
working for someone else you got to do

3294
02:14:17,159 --> 02:14:20,250
it how they tell you follow their rules

3295
02:14:18,930 --> 02:14:21,810
especially if they're paying you

3296
02:14:20,250 --> 02:14:23,640
especially if they're getting you high

3297
02:14:21,810 --> 02:14:25,200
follow their rules there there's a

3298
02:14:23,640 --> 02:14:26,880
leader of that girl you got to adjust it

3299
02:14:25,199 --> 02:14:28,199
there [ __ ] but check it out when they

3300
02:14:26,880 --> 02:14:30,239
come to your house to help you grow you

3301
02:14:28,199 --> 02:14:31,500
get to make the rules also so that's how

3302
02:14:30,239 --> 02:14:32,760
it goes the leader of the grow gets to

3303
02:14:31,500 --> 02:14:34,380
make the trim rules it's their product

3304
02:14:32,760 --> 02:14:36,840
they get to make the rules one thing I

3305
02:14:34,380 --> 02:14:38,940
have not mentioned almost this entire

3306
02:14:36,840 --> 02:14:40,079
process wore rubber gloves I talked

3307
02:14:38,939 --> 02:14:42,119
about that at the beginning of the show

3308
02:14:40,079 --> 02:14:43,260
just wear rubber gloves all the time

3309
02:14:42,119 --> 02:14:44,460
when you're in the garden put on rubber

3310
02:14:43,260 --> 02:14:46,260
gloves you don't want that [ __ ] in your

3311
02:14:44,460 --> 02:14:48,960
hands and the plants don't want your

3312
02:14:46,260 --> 02:14:49,680
hands on them so just wear gloves so now

3313
02:14:48,960 --> 02:14:50,850
you're wearing gloves

3314
02:14:49,680 --> 02:14:52,350
if you cut your buds and they're cut off

3315
02:14:50,850 --> 02:14:54,720
the sticks or they're on the sticks and

3316
02:14:52,350 --> 02:14:57,000
they're fairly dry you can either use

3317
02:14:54,720 --> 02:14:59,550
scissors or I use my thumbs you guys I

3318
02:14:57,000 --> 02:15:01,590
will take basically a stick with buds on

3319
02:14:59,550 --> 02:15:03,480
it and I will just take my thumb and

3320
02:15:01,590 --> 02:15:04,560
kind of just twiddle my thumbs round

3321
02:15:03,479 --> 02:15:06,239
these buds I just make a little

3322
02:15:04,560 --> 02:15:07,770
up-and-down motion and I knock the

3323
02:15:06,239 --> 02:15:09,960
leaves right off the bud without

3324
02:15:07,770 --> 02:15:11,310
disturbing the bud too much you'll catch

3325
02:15:09,960 --> 02:15:13,140
on to what I mean once you do it a

3326
02:15:11,310 --> 02:15:14,520
couple times just hold the bud almost

3327
02:15:13,140 --> 02:15:15,630
like a video game controller now that

3328
02:15:14,520 --> 02:15:17,700
I'm looking at my hands and use your

3329
02:15:15,630 --> 02:15:20,310
thumbs just to knock off the leaves

3330
02:15:17,699 --> 02:15:21,689
you'll find where the the perfect angle

3331
02:15:20,310 --> 02:15:23,400
to use your thumb I have a little

3332
02:15:21,689 --> 02:15:24,809
thumbnail on my right hand that I use so

3333
02:15:23,399 --> 02:15:26,489
beautifully I can use it even through a

3334
02:15:24,810 --> 02:15:28,260
glove just chop chop chop chop chop just

3335
02:15:26,489 --> 02:15:29,849
and the plants are fairly dry at this

3336
02:15:28,260 --> 02:15:30,989
boy and the leaves are already crispy

3337
02:15:29,850 --> 02:15:32,180
because they've been hanging up for so

3338
02:15:30,989 --> 02:15:33,559
long

3339
02:15:32,180 --> 02:15:35,119
that you're just going ahead and

3340
02:15:33,560 --> 02:15:36,530
knocking off those crispy leaves it'll

3341
02:15:35,119 --> 02:15:38,750
be really easy if you need scissors get

3342
02:15:36,529 --> 02:15:40,460
scissors get in there and cut off all

3343
02:15:38,750 --> 02:15:41,779
those funky leaves you'll be able to

3344
02:15:40,460 --> 02:15:43,579
tell what needs to come off you guys you

3345
02:15:41,779 --> 02:15:46,039
just want clean looking buds that aren't

3346
02:15:43,579 --> 02:15:47,720
leafy please trim your buds you guys and

3347
02:15:46,039 --> 02:15:49,579
you can save all if you're wet trimming

3348
02:15:47,720 --> 02:15:51,050
or dry trimming you can save all of your

3349
02:15:49,579 --> 02:15:53,779
material and you can make concentrates

3350
02:15:51,050 --> 02:15:55,610
out of it if you I cannot recommend

3351
02:15:53,779 --> 02:15:57,229
anybody to make their own BHO if they're

3352
02:15:55,609 --> 02:15:59,089
not experienced but if you know somebody

3353
02:15:57,229 --> 02:16:01,819
that is a qualified expert at making

3354
02:15:59,090 --> 02:16:03,650
butane honey oil you can make some BHO

3355
02:16:01,819 --> 02:16:05,119
if you want to make bubble hash out of

3356
02:16:03,649 --> 02:16:06,649
it you can if you want to make edibles

3359
02:16:08,119 --> 02:16:12,079
coconut oil you can do all of that with

3360
02:16:09,859 --> 02:16:13,429
your trim that is a possibility so

3361
02:16:12,079 --> 02:16:14,869
you've got your dry Bloods your dried

3362
02:16:13,430 --> 02:16:16,820
trimming them with your thumb once those

3363
02:16:14,869 --> 02:16:20,630
are dry once those were all trimmed I

3364
02:16:16,819 --> 02:16:22,099
feel like the buds that we dry a wet

3365
02:16:20,630 --> 02:16:23,690
trimmed earlier that we just cut off the

3366
02:16:22,100 --> 02:16:27,650
sticks in the last part I talked about

3367
02:16:23,689 --> 02:16:29,269
and these dry trimmed buds that we just

3368
02:16:27,649 --> 02:16:30,829
trimmed with our thumbs I think we're at

3369
02:16:29,270 --> 02:16:32,300
the same point with those in the same

3370
02:16:30,829 --> 02:16:34,399
story so our two characters have caught

3371
02:16:32,299 --> 02:16:37,519
up now you've got either way you've got

3372
02:16:34,399 --> 02:16:40,279
a pile of beautifully trimmed and maybe

3373
02:16:37,520 --> 02:16:42,050
you need to go back and hand trim those

3374
02:16:40,280 --> 02:16:43,280
other buds that you did before also a

3375
02:16:42,049 --> 02:16:44,689
little bit now that they've dried you

3376
02:16:43,280 --> 02:16:45,980
may notice some stuff you missed you may

3377
02:16:44,690 --> 02:16:47,000
need to go back and kind of clip them up

3378
02:16:45,979 --> 02:16:49,549
a little bit get in there are some

3379
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:52,159
scissors either way you got a pile of

3380
02:16:49,549 --> 02:16:54,409
beautifully trimmed perfectly grown buds

3381
02:16:52,159 --> 02:16:56,030
right there just where the stick snap

3382
02:16:54,409 --> 02:16:58,159
it's perfect now this is where the

3383
02:16:56,030 --> 02:16:59,420
curing process actually begins and I

3384
02:16:58,159 --> 02:17:00,829
know we're twenty five minutes into the

3385
02:16:59,420 --> 02:17:02,960
episode but I wanted to get you here

3386
02:17:00,829 --> 02:17:04,370
properly because you can you can't get

3387
02:17:02,959 --> 02:17:06,109
your black belt until you got all the

3388
02:17:04,370 --> 02:17:08,719
belts in front of it so now we're gonna

3389
02:17:06,110 --> 02:17:11,030
talk about curing is perfectly dried and

3390
02:17:08,718 --> 02:17:13,099
trimmed cannabis all right you guys I am

3391
02:17:11,030 --> 02:17:14,810
NOT a scientist I hope that's obvious

3392
02:17:13,100 --> 02:17:16,340
I have not referred to any notes in this

3393
02:17:14,809 --> 02:17:19,279
whole episode and I'm not gonna pull up

3394
02:17:16,340 --> 02:17:21,739
any notes to actually tell you this part

3395
02:17:19,280 --> 02:17:23,890
about why we want to cure our cannabis

3396
02:17:21,739 --> 02:17:26,809
here's basically my understanding of why

3397
02:17:23,889 --> 02:17:28,670
curing slowly is important chlorophyll

3398
02:17:26,809 --> 02:17:30,409
tastes like [ __ ] that's basically the

3399
02:17:28,670 --> 02:17:32,270
main part there's another reason to it

3400
02:17:30,409 --> 02:17:33,889
also but mainly chlorophyll tastes like

3401
02:17:32,270 --> 02:17:35,989
crap chlorophyll is a part of your

3402
02:17:33,889 --> 02:17:38,179
plants that makes them green we want to

3403
02:17:35,989 --> 02:17:39,590
get rid of as much chlorophyll as we can

3404
02:17:38,179 --> 02:17:41,870
from the buds we don't want to smoke

3405
02:17:39,590 --> 02:17:43,850
that so the only way that you can get

3406
02:17:41,870 --> 02:17:46,079
rid of chlorophyll the only way it can

3407
02:17:43,850 --> 02:17:47,969
evaporate is by evaporating with

3408
02:17:46,079 --> 02:17:50,250
moisture is the only way it can go away

3409
02:17:47,968 --> 02:17:52,409
but it's got to break down before it can

3410
02:17:50,250 --> 02:17:54,209
evaporate with moisture so it's got to

3411
02:17:52,409 --> 02:17:57,090
happen slowly and that's why we try to

3412
02:17:54,209 --> 02:18:00,928
cure slowly also another thing that

3413
02:17:57,090 --> 02:18:04,170
happens is the THC transfers from our it

3414
02:18:00,929 --> 02:18:07,229
changes for it transforms from THC to

3415
02:18:04,170 --> 02:18:09,540
THC a is my understanding and by

3416
02:18:07,229 --> 02:18:11,489
dropping a water molecule which is what

3417
02:18:09,540 --> 02:18:13,530
happens when the water slowly evaporates

3418
02:18:11,489 --> 02:18:15,510
it becomes much more psychoactive and

3419
02:18:13,530 --> 02:18:18,690
much more available to us when we smoke

3420
02:18:15,510 --> 02:18:20,219
it now if I said that wrong I would love

3421
02:18:18,690 --> 02:18:21,840
to hear your correction because that is

3422
02:18:20,218 --> 02:18:25,259
just off the top of my head and that is

3423
02:18:21,840 --> 02:18:28,079
my my little mental library of science

3424
02:18:25,260 --> 02:18:29,550
of why we cure cannabis mainly the

3425
02:18:28,079 --> 02:18:31,138
reason I cure cannabis because it makes

3426
02:18:29,549 --> 02:18:33,479
it taste better it makes it burn better

3427
02:18:31,138 --> 02:18:36,750
and it gets me higher and it just makes

3428
02:18:33,479 --> 02:18:38,549
it better overall so if you want a basic

3429
02:18:36,750 --> 02:18:40,229
reason or a science reason that is why

3430
02:18:38,549 --> 02:18:43,289
we want to cure our cannabis properly

3431
02:18:40,229 --> 02:18:44,939
and slowly so you've got your flush

3432
02:18:43,290 --> 02:18:46,020
phase done you've got your pre harvest

3433
02:18:44,940 --> 02:18:48,120
done where you chopped off all those

3434
02:18:46,020 --> 02:18:50,069
extra leaves then we cut down the plants

3435
02:18:48,120 --> 02:18:51,810
then we either wet trimmed them or we

3436
02:18:50,069 --> 02:18:53,489
cut off all the leaves and other hanging

3437
02:18:51,809 --> 02:18:55,829
up there pretty or we dried trimmed them

3438
02:18:53,489 --> 02:18:57,599
which we let them hang for a while and

3439
02:18:55,829 --> 02:18:59,610
they looked ugly as [ __ ] and then this

3440
02:18:57,599 --> 02:19:01,020
stems cracked but the buds were not

3441
02:18:59,610 --> 02:19:02,790
brittle you still want those buds nice

3442
02:19:01,020 --> 02:19:04,319
and moist so they're fluffy and sticky

3443
02:19:02,790 --> 02:19:06,389
guys that's what we're aiming for fluffy

3444
02:19:04,319 --> 02:19:07,829
and sticky buds that's that's right what

3445
02:19:06,388 --> 02:19:09,388
we're aiming for so you got those

3446
02:19:07,829 --> 02:19:11,549
cleaned up and now we've got these pile

3447
02:19:09,388 --> 02:19:13,439
or this pile of beautiful whatever you

3448
02:19:11,549 --> 02:19:16,619
grew you got this beautiful pile of

3449
02:19:13,440 --> 02:19:19,829
lemon Jeffrey it's perfectly trimmed its

3450
02:19:16,620 --> 02:19:21,690
sticky its fluffy the stems were popping

3451
02:19:19,829 --> 02:19:24,329
beautifully now here's what we're gonna

3452
02:19:21,690 --> 02:19:27,750
do we're gonna get some glass jars you

3453
02:19:24,329 --> 02:19:29,370
want like either koror ball glass jars I

3454
02:19:27,750 --> 02:19:32,879
like the larger ones with the wide mouth

3455
02:19:29,370 --> 02:19:34,800
I like those a lot I like to put just

3456
02:19:32,879 --> 02:19:36,569
gently drop the buds into the jar don't

3457
02:19:34,799 --> 02:19:39,119
pack them in there just drop buds into

3458
02:19:36,569 --> 02:19:41,459
the jar let them sit on their own fill

3459
02:19:39,120 --> 02:19:42,750
it up about 75 to 90% of the way you

3460
02:19:41,459 --> 02:19:44,609
don't want to stuff them in there you

3461
02:19:42,750 --> 02:19:47,599
don't want it only half way full you

3462
02:19:44,610 --> 02:19:49,430
want it like 75 to 90% of the way full

3463
02:19:47,599 --> 02:19:52,040
then you want to put the lid on that jar

3464
02:19:49,430 --> 02:19:53,119
and repeat put all your buds in jars

3465
02:19:52,040 --> 02:19:54,949
just keep going until you're out

3466
02:19:53,119 --> 02:19:56,569
hopefully you have a lot of jars

3467
02:19:54,949 --> 02:19:59,090
hopefully you get tired of filling jars

3468
02:19:56,568 --> 02:20:01,760
with weed that's my goal for you so fill

3469
02:19:59,090 --> 02:20:04,908
all your jars with buds then put those

3470
02:20:01,760 --> 02:20:06,710
jars in a cool dry dark place hopefully

3471
02:20:04,908 --> 02:20:08,180
the same environment similar to the

3472
02:20:06,709 --> 02:20:09,829
environment that we had the buds in

3473
02:20:08,180 --> 02:20:11,600
while they were drying I know they're in

3474
02:20:09,829 --> 02:20:12,978
a jar but we still want to keep them

3475
02:20:11,600 --> 02:20:14,658
cool and dry and we want to keep them

3476
02:20:12,978 --> 02:20:18,068
dark they are still doing their thing

3477
02:20:14,658 --> 02:20:20,359
there so we want to keep them dark now

3478
02:20:18,068 --> 02:20:21,920
I'm kind of weird and I have a lot of

3479
02:20:20,359 --> 02:20:23,750
time to dedicate to my buds in my

3480
02:20:21,920 --> 02:20:26,689
projects you may not be able to do this

3481
02:20:23,750 --> 02:20:28,939
this will this is adjustable okay I like

3482
02:20:26,689 --> 02:20:31,250
to go back about two hours later and

3483
02:20:28,939 --> 02:20:33,109
open that jar for just a couple of

3484
02:20:31,250 --> 02:20:34,609
minutes you know like maybe five minutes

3485
02:20:33,109 --> 02:20:37,100
I want the air to move around in that

3486
02:20:34,609 --> 02:20:38,960
jar just let it fluff around and then I

3487
02:20:37,100 --> 02:20:40,880
close it up and then I'll come back

3488
02:20:38,959 --> 02:20:42,829
about four hours later and do it again

3489
02:20:40,879 --> 02:20:45,049
and then before I go to bed I will

3490
02:20:42,829 --> 02:20:47,359
actually dump out all of the buds out of

3491
02:20:45,049 --> 02:20:48,679
the jar and I will rearrange them and

3492
02:20:47,359 --> 02:20:50,090
I'll put them back in the jar and I'll

3493
02:20:48,680 --> 02:20:51,350
leave the jar open for like a good I

3494
02:20:50,090 --> 02:20:53,750
don't know three or four or four or five

3495
02:20:51,350 --> 02:20:55,670
minutes because I want I want fresh air

3496
02:20:53,750 --> 02:20:57,079
around that I want anything that like

3497
02:20:55,670 --> 02:20:58,219
any stagnant spot where they had been

3498
02:20:57,079 --> 02:20:59,809
pressed together or they've been

3499
02:20:58,219 --> 02:21:01,398
sweating on each other I want to give

3500
02:20:59,809 --> 02:21:03,408
him some breathing room I don't want any

3501
02:21:01,398 --> 02:21:05,898
mold to happen inside that jars what I'm

3502
02:21:03,408 --> 02:21:07,789
getting at so I'll crack it open it like

3503
02:21:05,898 --> 02:21:09,889
two hours and then four hours and then

3504
02:21:07,790 --> 02:21:10,909
six hours and then maybe eight hours and

3505
02:21:09,889 --> 02:21:12,469
then I'll try to go to bed for a few

3506
02:21:10,908 --> 02:21:13,850
hours and ignore it but the first thing

3507
02:21:12,469 --> 02:21:15,559
you know I'm gonna do when I wake up is

3508
02:21:13,850 --> 02:21:17,600
go crack open those jars and smell them

3509
02:21:15,559 --> 02:21:19,219
and at first they're gonna smell wet

3510
02:21:17,600 --> 02:21:21,199
they're gonna smell like damp weed if

3511
02:21:19,219 --> 02:21:22,938
you're getting like a hey smell or an

3512
02:21:21,199 --> 02:21:24,500
ammonia smell you don't [ __ ] up that's

3513
02:21:22,939 --> 02:21:25,818
gonna be hard to fix that you left it

3514
02:21:24,500 --> 02:21:29,209
closed for too long or you put it in

3515
02:21:25,818 --> 02:21:30,859
there too early so pay attention you

3516
02:21:29,209 --> 02:21:32,629
don't want it super wet if it's super

3517
02:21:30,859 --> 02:21:34,579
wet leave it open a little longer but

3518
02:21:32,629 --> 02:21:36,618
some of that water come out or open it

3519
02:21:34,579 --> 02:21:39,260
more frequently you do not want mold

3520
02:21:36,619 --> 02:21:42,140
starting in there so open up the jar

3521
02:21:39,260 --> 02:21:45,380
like I'm weird so four hours six hours

3522
02:21:42,139 --> 02:21:47,510
eight hours 12 hours and then start the

3523
02:21:45,379 --> 02:21:49,698
more it dries the more slowly the more

3524
02:21:47,510 --> 02:21:51,260
less frequently you can open it but you

3525
02:21:49,699 --> 02:21:53,000
want to be opening that jar once or

3526
02:21:51,260 --> 02:21:54,889
twice a day we call it burping the jar

3527
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:57,170
so you want to birth that jar once or

3528
02:21:54,889 --> 02:21:59,358
twice every day and then after about

3529
02:21:57,170 --> 02:21:59,960
five to seven days you're gonna notice

3530
02:21:59,359 --> 02:22:02,720
the

3531
02:21:59,959 --> 02:22:04,340
are dry but they're still spongy you'll

3532
02:22:02,720 --> 02:22:06,109
squeeze them and they'll kind of

3533
02:22:04,341 --> 02:22:07,670
compress and then they'll fluff back up

3534
02:22:06,110 --> 02:22:09,230
and then you'll break them open in the

3535
02:22:07,670 --> 02:22:11,120
middle there will be a little bit of

3536
02:22:09,229 --> 02:22:13,100
moisture still but they'll smell real

3537
02:22:11,120 --> 02:22:14,900
dank they'll have a really good smell

3538
02:22:13,101 --> 02:22:16,700
when you smoke it it's gonna burn

3539
02:22:14,899 --> 02:22:18,229
beautifully and then keep doing that

3540
02:22:16,700 --> 02:22:19,670
just lock them into that jar and leave

3541
02:22:18,229 --> 02:22:21,170
it in there and only open it once a day

3542
02:22:19,670 --> 02:22:22,399
after the first week you know what I

3543
02:22:21,170 --> 02:22:23,899
mean once we're getting were they're

3544
02:22:22,399 --> 02:22:25,579
smokable just leave them in there and

3545
02:22:23,899 --> 02:22:27,800
only open that jar once a day I

3546
02:22:25,579 --> 02:22:29,989
recommend that you take out if you think

3547
02:22:27,800 --> 02:22:31,220
you're gonna smoke I'd be ridiculous

3548
02:22:29,989 --> 02:22:32,750
maybe you're gonna smoke seven grams a

3549
02:22:31,220 --> 02:22:34,159
weed today pull out seven grams for

3550
02:22:32,750 --> 02:22:35,899
yourself put that in your head stash

3551
02:22:34,159 --> 02:22:37,610
star and leave the rest in the cure jar

3552
02:22:35,899 --> 02:22:40,159
so that you just leave it sealed up and

3553
02:22:37,610 --> 02:22:41,391
then every day or other day go pull out

3554
02:22:40,159 --> 02:22:42,619
how much you're gonna smoke for the next

3555
02:22:41,390 --> 02:22:44,091
couple days and leave the rest of that

3556
02:22:42,620 --> 02:22:47,061
stuff in there to cure and it's gonna be

3557
02:22:44,091 --> 02:22:49,790
a lot better so you got your buds there

3558
02:22:47,060 --> 02:22:51,380
they're still damp but they're drying

3559
02:22:49,790 --> 02:22:52,431
you know what I mean you want plenty of

3560
02:22:51,380 --> 02:22:55,819
moisture in there but you don't want

3561
02:22:52,431 --> 02:22:56,960
them too moist if they're juicy you

3562
02:22:55,819 --> 02:22:58,459
don't want to put them in there so when

3563
02:22:56,959 --> 02:23:00,439
they're kind of as soon as those stems

3564
02:22:58,459 --> 02:23:02,689
pop you should be cool put them in the

3565
02:23:00,440 --> 02:23:04,819
jar seal that jar up put it in a dark

3566
02:23:02,690 --> 02:23:06,739
place and then every just increase your

3567
02:23:04,819 --> 02:23:09,380
timeframe and pay attention to those if

3568
02:23:06,739 --> 02:23:11,091
you've got multiple jars experiment open

3569
02:23:09,380 --> 02:23:12,500
one up every four hours and see what

3570
02:23:11,091 --> 02:23:14,540
it's like and then leave a couple of

3571
02:23:12,500 --> 02:23:16,069
them closed and then but don't go too

3572
02:23:14,540 --> 02:23:17,811
long with it you don't ever want to go

3573
02:23:16,069 --> 02:23:19,459
like right away I would say check them

3574
02:23:17,810 --> 02:23:21,170
every four to six hours in the beginning

3575
02:23:19,459 --> 02:23:24,319
and then increase that time until you go

3576
02:23:21,170 --> 02:23:26,060
every 12 it's gonna be up to you to

3577
02:23:24,319 --> 02:23:27,020
judge how often your jars need to be

3578
02:23:26,060 --> 02:23:29,270
open and I'm trying to give you

3579
02:23:27,021 --> 02:23:30,471
timeframes but I don't want it I don't

3580
02:23:29,271 --> 02:23:31,971
want you to mess up your buds because if

3581
02:23:30,470 --> 02:23:34,909
you have different temperatures if you

3582
02:23:31,970 --> 02:23:37,399
have different humidity problems if you

3583
02:23:34,909 --> 02:23:39,979
may if you leave it closed too long you

3584
02:23:37,399 --> 02:23:42,100
may cause a mildew issue so it's an art

3585
02:23:39,979 --> 02:23:45,261
every art there's some trial and error

3586
02:23:42,101 --> 02:23:47,420
try not to [ __ ] up and try not to make

3587
02:23:45,261 --> 02:23:49,280
errors that's my best advice do you pay

3588
02:23:47,420 --> 02:23:50,659
attention don't be afraid to mess up a

3589
02:23:49,280 --> 02:23:51,920
little bit but don't mess up a whole

3590
02:23:50,659 --> 02:23:53,601
bunch you gotta mess up once or twice

3591
02:23:51,920 --> 02:23:55,069
you didn't learn how to ride that bike

3592
02:23:53,601 --> 02:23:56,091
really cool until you crashed a couple

3593
02:23:55,069 --> 02:23:59,659
times and then you learned what you

3594
02:23:56,091 --> 02:24:02,120
could do so that's my my quick crash

3595
02:23:59,659 --> 02:24:04,341
course on how to dry and cure your

3596
02:24:02,120 --> 02:24:05,780
cannabis I feel like once your cannabis

3597
02:24:04,341 --> 02:24:07,220
is properly dried and cured it can be

3598
02:24:05,780 --> 02:24:09,380
stored for

3599
02:24:07,219 --> 02:24:10,760
and I've had some weed for three to six

3600
02:24:09,379 --> 02:24:12,498
months before I've stored weed for a

3601
02:24:10,760 --> 02:24:13,818
year before if you keep it in the proper

3602
02:24:12,498 --> 02:24:15,379
conditions in the proper environment

3603
02:24:13,818 --> 02:24:17,988
different strains will keep for a

3604
02:24:15,379 --> 02:24:19,759
different amount of times I've had some

3605
02:24:17,988 --> 02:24:21,408
stuff that I kept in a refrigerator in

3606
02:24:19,760 --> 02:24:21,949
the back for a very long time it was

3607
02:24:21,408 --> 02:24:23,988
okay

3608
02:24:21,949 --> 02:24:25,789
I remember a long time ago I hid some

3609
02:24:23,988 --> 02:24:27,109
weed from myself in a freezer and I

3610
02:24:25,789 --> 02:24:29,689
forgot about it and I found it when I

3611
02:24:27,109 --> 02:24:31,010
moved out of that house that weed tasted

3612
02:24:29,689 --> 02:24:32,449
really terrible putting it in the

3613
02:24:31,010 --> 02:24:34,158
freezer did something weird do it I

3614
02:24:32,449 --> 02:24:35,748
don't know what went wrong like I said a

3615
02:24:34,158 --> 02:24:37,219
little bit ago I gave a disclaimer I'm

3616
02:24:35,748 --> 02:24:38,988
not a scientist I'm just a man with a

3617
02:24:37,219 --> 02:24:40,068

it is super dope I bought it at a

3699
02:33:25,850 --> 02:33:29,300
costume shop it took him a long time to

3700
02:33:27,738 --> 02:33:31,578
get it in stock it took like three weeks

3701
02:33:29,299 --> 02:33:33,139
to order that thing it was kind of

3702
02:33:31,578 --> 02:33:35,180
pricey you know it wasn't the cheapest

3703
02:33:33,139 --> 02:33:36,769
costume anybody's ever bought but it was

3704
02:33:35,180 --> 02:33:38,328
well worth it because I've had it for I

3705
02:33:36,770 --> 02:33:40,760
kept had it for four or five years and I

wear it every other year and every year

3707
02:33:40,760 --> 02:33:44,270
I went at least one costume contest in

3708
02:33:42,559 --> 02:33:46,939
it so it is paid for itself

3709
02:33:44,270 --> 02:33:50,600

3711
02:33:50,600 --> 02:33:54,859

3712
02:33:53,270 --> 02:33:56,770
than normal orange but it's like orange

3713

it's got a pumpkin on the back of it

3715
02:33:58,939 --> 02:34:03,090
it's just a straight tube it's about

3716
02:34:00,949 --> 02:34:04,890
that's probably

3717
02:34:03,090 --> 02:34:07,260
it's almost the same it's the same

3718
02:34:04,889 --> 02:34:08,969
height as my Dr Pepper bottle almost the

3719
02:34:07,260 --> 02:34:11,040
height of a water bottle so it's a

3720
02:34:08,969 --> 02:34:12,869
straight tube it's got a round ball

3721
02:34:11,040 --> 02:34:14,580
pumpkin looking base and then it's got a

3722
02:34:12,870 --> 02:34:16,680
straight tube and then another orange

3723
02:34:14,579 --> 02:34:18,299
kind of a pumpkin looking spot and then

3724
02:34:16,680 --> 02:34:20,340
a straight piece and then another

3725
02:34:18,299 --> 02:34:22,709
pumpkin looking an orange bulb with a

3726
02:34:20,340 --> 02:34:25,049
green top on it so it looks pumpkiny it

3727
02:34:22,709 --> 02:34:26,819
takes a 14 millimeter banger so I got a

3728
02:34:25,049 --> 02:34:29,099
14 millimeter banger on it that came

3729

3733
02:34:33,450 --> 02:34:37,079
costume contest but guess what the

3734
02:34:35,459 --> 02:34:39,179
people from elevate did not decide that

3735
02:34:37,079 --> 02:34:40,920
I want the crowd decided that I won the

3736
02:34:39,180 --> 02:34:43,350
costume contest so it could not be a fix

3737
02:34:40,920 --> 02:34:45,210
it was based on crowd applause and it

3738
02:34:43,350 --> 02:34:46,800
was clear that they liked my costume so

3739

you guys honestly I'm probably 7 - on

3763
02:35:29,670 --> 02:35:33,899
the Chewbacca costume because the mask

3764
02:35:31,920 --> 02:35:35,210
is real real tall so it makes me a

3765
02:35:33,899 --> 02:35:38,250
little taller

3766
02:35:35,209 --> 02:35:40,169

3769
02:35:41,459 --> 02:35:45,059
to bend over to do a pose or something

3770
02:35:43,469 --> 02:35:46,529
she did something and then they told me

3771
02:35:45,059 --> 02:35:47,789
to squat down cuz I'm too tall and they

3772
02:35:46,530 --> 02:35:50,070

3882
02:39:36,340 --> 02:39:40,750
topic of this podcast the main thing I

3883
02:39:39,340 --> 02:39:42,370
want to talk about I was on a forum the

3884
02:39:40,750 --> 02:39:43,930
other day yes I do read the forum's I

3885
02:39:42,370 --> 02:39:45,820
roll around I do not use the name that

3886
02:39:43,930 --> 02:39:47,440
anybody will recognize me by so you

3887
02:39:45,819 --> 02:39:50,619
won't find me on there I've also had a

3888
02:39:47,440 --> 02:39:51,819
bunch of Facebook groups but I've I've

3889
02:39:50,620 --> 02:39:54,010
had to check out of a bunch of the

3890
02:39:51,819 --> 02:40:01,270
Facebook groups because honestly I see

3891
02:39:54,010 --> 02:40:02,620
so we'll deal with it we'll get through

3892
02:40:01,271 --> 02:40:04,630
a podcast it'll quit right about the

3893
02:40:02,620 --> 02:40:06,550
time the show ends I see a bunch of

3894
02:40:04,629 --> 02:40:08,559
[ __ ] and Facebook groups yes I see

3895
02:40:06,549 --> 02:40:10,270
people recommending the shittiest advice

3896
02:40:08,559 --> 02:40:11,649
and then I go look at the person that

3897
02:40:10,271 --> 02:40:13,329
gave that advice I look at their

3898
02:40:11,649 --> 02:40:14,770
pictures of their grow and I can see why

3899
02:40:13,329 --> 02:40:16,271
their girl looks the way it does and why

3900
02:40:14,771 --> 02:40:18,730
they're giving the advice that they are

3901
02:40:16,271 --> 02:40:20,739
giving they're not qualified and it kind

3902
02:40:18,729 --> 02:40:22,090
of frustrates me so I had to leave a

3903
02:40:20,739 --> 02:40:25,420
bunch of Facebook groups I'm not in a

3904
02:40:22,090 --> 02:40:27,010
lot of them but I do go troll around and

3905
02:40:25,420 --> 02:40:29,620
browse around the forums so I see what's

3906
02:40:27,010 --> 02:40:31,360
going on and lately a topic I've seen

3907
02:40:29,620 --> 02:40:32,800
more than once or twice is people were

3908
02:40:31,360 --> 02:40:35,590
talking about ways to determine

3909
02:40:32,799 --> 02:40:37,029
flowering times of new seeds and new

3910
02:40:35,590 --> 02:40:39,010
clones that they've gotten that they

3911
02:40:37,030 --> 02:40:40,600
don't have any information on maybe

3912
02:40:39,010 --> 02:40:42,159
somebody got some bagged seed and they

3913
02:40:40,600 --> 02:40:43,210
don't know how long to let that bag seed

3914
02:40:42,159 --> 02:40:44,799
flower

3915
02:40:43,209 --> 02:40:46,269
maybe somebody was gifted a clone and

3916
02:40:44,799 --> 02:40:47,978
they don't know anything about the clone

3917
02:40:46,270 --> 02:40:49,540
from the friend they gave it to him so

3918
02:40:47,978 --> 02:40:52,510
they were like hey Ross - Jeff how do I

3919
02:40:49,540 --> 02:40:54,430
determine how long to let these plants

3920
02:40:52,510 --> 02:40:56,020
flower so that I don't [ __ ] up my crop

3921
02:40:54,430 --> 02:40:57,159
so you guys I'm gonna get some water

3922
02:40:56,020 --> 02:40:58,659
here to fix up my throat you know I'm

3923
02:40:57,159 --> 02:40:59,829
gonna take a couple more dabs and then

3924
02:40:58,659 --> 02:41:01,600
after that we're gonna talk about how to

3925
02:40:59,829 --> 02:41:07,299
determine flowering time of new

3926
02:41:01,600 --> 02:41:08,979
cultivars I am back I promised we would

3927
02:41:07,299 --> 02:41:11,500
talk about ways to determine flowering

3928
02:41:08,978 --> 02:41:13,329
time of new cultivars so maybe you've

3929
02:41:11,500 --> 02:41:14,799
got some seeds and you don't know how

3930
02:41:13,329 --> 02:41:16,600
long those seeds are supposed to take

3931
02:41:14,799 --> 02:41:18,189
maybe you maybe you had a bunch of pack

3932
02:41:16,600 --> 02:41:19,899
to seed then these got mixed up or

3933
02:41:18,190 --> 02:41:21,159
mislabeled or weren't labeled at all or

3934
02:41:19,899 --> 02:41:22,420
maybe they came out of a bag maybe

3935
02:41:21,159 --> 02:41:24,250
you've got seeds that you're running you

3936
02:41:22,420 --> 02:41:25,629
have no idea what they are you're gonna

3937
02:41:24,250 --> 02:41:27,819
need to know how long to let those

3938
02:41:25,629 --> 02:41:29,228
plants flower maybe your buddy gave you

3939
02:41:27,819 --> 02:41:29,770
clothes maybe you bought clones at the

3940
02:41:29,228 --> 02:41:31,569
dispensary

3941
02:41:29,770 --> 02:41:33,280
maybe you cut clones and you don't know

3942
02:41:31,569 --> 02:41:35,049
which clone that is you need to

3943
02:41:33,280 --> 02:41:38,409
determine how long to let that plant

3944
02:41:35,049 --> 02:41:39,789
flower so obviously the way to the

3945
02:41:38,409 --> 02:41:42,039
easiest way to do that would to be

3946
02:41:39,790 --> 02:41:44,320
flower that plant out and then around

3947
02:41:42,040 --> 02:41:46,510
week seven or eight maybe eight or nine

3948
02:41:44,319 --> 02:41:48,129
I have to say about week seven get in

3949
02:41:46,510 --> 02:41:51,489
there and start looking at that plant

3950
02:41:48,129 --> 02:41:53,739
with a loop or a magnifier of some sort

3951
02:41:51,489 --> 02:41:56,709
of a magnifying glass some sort of an

3952
02:41:53,739 --> 02:41:58,780
eye you need at least a 60 to 100 times

3953
02:41:56,709 --> 02:42:01,779
magnifying glass to look at these plants

3954
02:41:58,780 --> 02:42:03,550
you want to see the trichomes that are

3955
02:42:01,780 --> 02:42:05,050
on your buds and look in a few different

3956
02:42:03,549 --> 02:42:07,809
places on the plant don't just look in

3957
02:42:05,049 --> 02:42:12,728
one spot so what I use hooks up to my

3958
02:42:07,809 --> 02:42:14,439
computer I've got me the brand

3959
02:42:12,728 --> 02:42:19,090
it's from Dino scope I've got a Dino

3960
02:42:14,440 --> 02:42:21,250
scope scope that hooks up it's a USB

3961
02:42:19,090 --> 02:42:22,630
port goes right into my computer I works

3962
02:42:21,250 --> 02:42:24,340
with a Mac it works with the Windows

3963
02:42:22,629 --> 02:42:25,509
machine I use it on a Mac so I promise

3964
02:42:24,340 --> 02:42:26,978
it works it was a [ __ ] to get it

3965
02:42:25,510 --> 02:42:28,809
started but once I downloaded the driver

3966
02:42:26,978 --> 02:42:31,090
and got it working it works beautifully

3967
02:42:28,809 --> 02:42:34,119
every time now I can take screenshots of

3968
02:42:31,090 --> 02:42:37,149
what I'm seeing but this little scope I

3969
02:42:34,120 --> 02:42:38,890
basically I can take I take my chair cuz

3970
02:42:37,149 --> 02:42:40,359
it rolls and has wheels and I put the

3971
02:42:38,889 --> 02:42:42,250
MacBook on the chair because I'm clumsy

3972
02:42:40,360 --> 02:42:43,540
and I like to drop [ __ ] so I leave the

3973
02:42:42,250 --> 02:42:45,760
MacBook on the chair and I roll it

3974
02:42:43,540 --> 02:42:47,410
around and then I use the scope it's got

3975
02:42:45,760 --> 02:42:49,780
a nice long cord and then I use that

3976
02:42:47,409 --> 02:42:50,770
scope to go find the spots that I want

3977
02:42:49,780 --> 02:42:53,079
on the plant and then I look at the

3978
02:42:50,770 --> 02:42:56,101
screen and I can see if the trichomes

3979
02:42:53,079 --> 02:42:58,681
are amber or if the trichomes are clear

3980
02:42:56,101 --> 02:43:00,331
they're milky or if they're busted

3981
02:42:58,681 --> 02:43:02,610
ruptured open and got [ __ ] dripping out

3982
02:43:00,331 --> 02:43:04,591
of them I can see that clearly with the

3983
02:43:02,610 --> 02:43:06,931
scope I've got I can see bugs [ __ ] if

3984
02:43:04,591 --> 02:43:09,479
there is bug [ __ ] in my plants I can see

3985
02:43:06,931 --> 02:43:11,131
any insect in the world with this scope

3986
02:43:09,479 --> 02:43:12,479
that I've got so I like to pull leaf off

3987
02:43:11,130 --> 02:43:13,979
randomly and look at the underside of

3988
02:43:12,479 --> 02:43:16,199
the leaf and see what's going on look

3989
02:43:13,979 --> 02:43:18,720
for eggs looks for bugs look for bugs

3990
02:43:16,200 --> 02:43:21,331
[ __ ] look for signs of bugs so what you

3991
02:43:18,720 --> 02:43:24,300
need if you can't get that type of a

3992
02:43:21,331 --> 02:43:26,280
thing for your computer they sell the

3993
02:43:24,300 --> 02:43:28,171
420 scope is okay I think they caught

3994
02:43:26,280 --> 02:43:30,650
the dope scope or the 420 scope that's

3995
02:43:28,171 --> 02:43:33,421
okay there's one sold at the Gro store

3996
02:43:30,649 --> 02:43:35,130
that is made by Hydra farm which is the

3997
02:43:33,421 --> 02:43:37,110
one that I like I have the 100x little

3998
02:43:35,130 --> 02:43:38,880
scope it takes a double a battery at

3999
02:43:37,110 --> 02:43:41,159
fault it may take two batteries but it

4000
02:43:38,880 --> 02:43:42,779
folds it folds together real nicely when

4001
02:43:41,159 --> 02:43:44,851
you unfold it it lights up and then you

4002
02:43:42,780 --> 02:43:46,440
can see through it real well that one I

4003
02:43:44,851 --> 02:43:48,569
really like but get yourself a scope so

4004
02:43:46,440 --> 02:43:51,331
that you can look at the trichomes at

4005
02:43:48,569 --> 02:43:53,399
least 60 X 100x magnification is better

4006
02:43:51,331 --> 02:43:56,341
it's most obvious way to tell when

4007
02:43:53,399 --> 02:43:57,720
plants are done when within your view

4008
02:43:56,341 --> 02:43:59,370
you're probably gonna see a certain

4009
02:43:57,720 --> 02:44:02,430
amount of trichomes it's gonna be hard

4010
02:43:59,370 --> 02:44:04,440
to count them but you want about 25 to

4011
02:44:02,431 --> 02:44:06,181
30 percent of those 20 to 30 percent of

4012
02:44:04,440 --> 02:44:07,471
those you want them turning amber you

4013
02:44:06,181 --> 02:44:09,631
want it to kind of look like the color

4014
02:44:07,470 --> 02:44:11,790
like maybe you dip them in dr. pepper or

4015
02:44:09,630 --> 02:44:14,159
maybe they got a little they're just you

4016
02:44:11,790 --> 02:44:16,890
could see it it turns amber orangish

4017
02:44:14,159 --> 02:44:19,171
color they'll start off clear then

4018
02:44:16,890 --> 02:44:21,119
they'll get milky and then they get like

4019
02:44:19,171 --> 02:44:22,739
a silvery color and then from silver

4020
02:44:21,120 --> 02:44:24,480
that's when they start turning amber oh

4021
02:44:22,739 --> 02:44:25,921
and thirty percent your trichomes are

4022
02:44:24,479 --> 02:44:28,949
amber that's usually when you want to

4023
02:44:25,921 --> 02:44:30,720
harvest most strains so it's kind of up

4024
02:44:28,950 --> 02:44:32,820
to you you can go a little early you can

4025
02:44:30,720 --> 02:44:35,189
go a little late it's not that huge of a

4026
02:44:32,819 --> 02:44:37,279
deal a lot of people way over stress the

4027
02:44:35,190 --> 02:44:40,501
harvest window in a production facility

4028
02:44:37,280 --> 02:44:41,730
we say this string gets this many days

4029
02:44:40,501 --> 02:44:43,140
and then we're cutting it the [ __ ] down

4030
02:44:41,729 --> 02:44:45,421
because we have another crop coming up

4031
02:44:43,140 --> 02:44:47,431
right behind it so and that the weed

4032
02:44:45,421 --> 02:44:49,470
comes out pretty fabulous in most of the

4033
02:44:47,431 --> 02:44:52,890
production facilities and we just pick

4034
02:44:49,470 --> 02:44:55,050
something like 60 days or 70 days I like

4035
02:44:52,890 --> 02:44:56,640
to say 63 days because that's nine full

4036
02:44:55,050 --> 02:44:58,560
weeks of flower and most of the strains

4037
02:44:56,640 --> 02:45:00,359
were running nowadays nine weeks is

4038
02:44:58,560 --> 02:45:04,681
perfect but let's talk a little more

4039
02:45:00,360 --> 02:45:05,909
because this scope looking at the

4040
02:45:04,681 --> 02:45:07,591
trichomes is really gonna help you out

4041
02:45:05,909 --> 02:45:09,789
but you're going to need to know a

4042
02:45:07,591 --> 02:45:12,159
little earlier in the game

4043
02:45:09,790 --> 02:45:14,200
when to harvest because you're gonna

4044
02:45:12,159 --> 02:45:16,450
need to flush your plants about ten to

4045
02:45:14,200 --> 02:45:18,940
14 days before you start cutting down i

4046
02:45:16,450 --> 02:45:21,040
heavily stress flushing your plants it's

4047
02:45:18,940 --> 02:45:23,530
free and you've got to water the plants

4048
02:45:21,040 --> 02:45:25,860
anyway so why not just pour a bunch of

4049
02:45:23,530 --> 02:45:29,290
water in there and clean the plant out

4050
02:45:25,860 --> 02:45:31,030
so let's talk about some ways to

4051
02:45:29,290 --> 02:45:33,221
determine how long those plants are

4052
02:45:31,030 --> 02:45:35,320
gonna take you need to figure out how

4053
02:45:33,220 --> 02:45:37,720
indica or sativa dominant those plants

4054
02:45:35,319 --> 02:45:42,250
are and a huge indicator of that is leaf

4055
02:45:37,720 --> 02:45:44,500
shape and size if your leaf has really

4056
02:45:42,250 --> 02:45:46,091
long slender fingers it's probably

4057
02:45:44,500 --> 02:45:47,970
sativa dominant and you're gonna lead

4058
02:45:46,091 --> 02:45:51,550
more toward the nine to ten week range

4059
02:45:47,970 --> 02:45:54,310
maybe even longer if your plants have

4060
02:45:51,550 --> 02:45:57,250
big fat broad leaves if they're real

4061
02:45:54,310 --> 02:45:58,569
wide if the wider the leaf probably the

4062
02:45:57,250 --> 02:46:00,250
shorter the flowering period is

4063
02:45:58,569 --> 02:46:02,619
something that I've learned it's not

4064
02:46:00,250 --> 02:46:03,970
always true but it's usually a good

4065
02:46:02,620 --> 02:46:05,891
thing to follow so if you've got good

4066
02:46:03,970 --> 02:46:09,880
wide leaves you're looking at eight to

4067
02:46:05,890 --> 02:46:11,921
nine weeks now if you've got a eight or

4068
02:46:09,880 --> 02:46:13,989
nine week plant the first time you run

4069
02:46:11,921 --> 02:46:16,030
it I recommend going nine weeks why not

4070
02:46:13,989 --> 02:46:17,681
try that extra week to see what happens

4071
02:46:16,030 --> 02:46:19,570
you may get more bulk right at the end

4072
02:46:17,681 --> 02:46:22,421
you may get more resin right at the end

4073
02:46:19,569 --> 02:46:24,011
it may harden up it may do a lot of good

4074
02:46:22,421 --> 02:46:25,630
[ __ ] in that lasts one week so let that

4075
02:46:24,011 --> 02:46:27,851
happen it's not gonna over ripen too

4076
02:46:25,630 --> 02:46:29,560
much but it don't worry about a little

4077
02:46:27,851 --> 02:46:30,761
overripe it's not that huge of a game

4078
02:46:29,560 --> 02:46:31,960
especially if it's your first time

4079
02:46:30,761 --> 02:46:33,909
that's something I wrote down that I

4080
02:46:31,960 --> 02:46:36,880
wanted to wait a little while to mention

4081
02:46:33,909 --> 02:46:39,101
but this is hopefully not your last time

4082
02:46:36,880 --> 02:46:40,630
running this strain this is your first

4083
02:46:39,101 --> 02:46:42,730
time running this strain which means you

4084
02:46:40,630 --> 02:46:44,590
can [ __ ] it up because you have another

4085
02:46:42,729 --> 02:46:46,210
time and another time and another time

4086
02:46:44,591 --> 02:46:48,671
after that to run it hopefully if this

4087
02:46:46,210 --> 02:46:49,750
is a good genetic good cultivar and you

4088
02:46:48,671 --> 02:46:51,700
can keep it around you're gonna be

4089
02:46:49,750 --> 02:46:52,989
running in a bunch of times so this is

4090
02:46:51,700 --> 02:46:57,221
just your test run this is your first

4091
02:46:52,989 --> 02:46:59,800
date you'll be ok so leaf size and leaf

4092
02:46:57,220 --> 02:47:01,390
shape will give you a big hint on how

4093
02:46:59,800 --> 02:47:03,310
long those plants are gonna take if

4094
02:47:01,390 --> 02:47:04,720
you've got an 8 or 9 week plant like I

4095
02:47:03,310 --> 02:47:06,279
just said like eight or nine weekend to

4096
02:47:04,720 --> 02:47:08,079
go let it go nine weeks because you want

4097
02:47:06,280 --> 02:47:09,909
it to go to full maturity if you've got

4098
02:47:08,079 --> 02:47:11,530
a plant with long skinny leaves that's a

4099
02:47:09,909 --> 02:47:12,970
nine to ten week plant I would recommend

4100
02:47:11,530 --> 02:47:14,711
lighting that plant go ten weeks the

4101
02:47:12,970 --> 02:47:17,020
first time why not you want to see what

4102
02:47:14,710 --> 02:47:18,729
the potential of that plant is a lot of

4103
02:47:17,021 --> 02:47:19,961
those sativa plants really do magical

4104
02:47:18,729 --> 02:47:21,699
[ __ ] toward the end of their growth

4105
02:47:19,960 --> 02:47:22,659
phase or at the end of their flowering

4106
02:47:21,700 --> 02:47:24,909
phase

4107
02:47:22,659 --> 02:47:26,591
they resin up they really put on some

4108
02:47:24,909 --> 02:47:28,479
flavor they get better at the end

4109
02:47:26,591 --> 02:47:29,890
they're probably swelling up because

4110
02:47:28,479 --> 02:47:31,239
they want to be bred too and you're not

4111
02:47:29,890 --> 02:47:33,011
giving them any pollen so they're just

4112
02:47:31,239 --> 02:47:34,720
getting bigger and bigger and stickier

4113
02:47:33,011 --> 02:47:36,581
and fatter so sometimes it's better to

4114
02:47:34,720 --> 02:47:38,859
let those sativa strains go longer I

4115
02:47:36,581 --> 02:47:41,771
like in 11 weeks ateva it doesn't scare

4116
02:47:38,860 --> 02:47:44,141
me to run a 77 day sativa dominant plant

4117
02:47:41,771 --> 02:47:45,489
flower it when it's real short be ready

4118
02:47:44,140 --> 02:47:47,171
to have some sticks and supports

4119
02:47:45,489 --> 02:47:48,880
available and get that sucker going

4120
02:47:47,171 --> 02:47:50,800
don't be afraid to grow something that

4121
02:47:48,880 --> 02:47:52,239
takes seventy seven days or even maybe a

4122
02:47:50,800 --> 02:47:54,010
little bit longer it's well worth it

4123
02:47:52,239 --> 02:47:56,050
you're gonna get more potency usually

4124
02:47:54,011 --> 02:47:58,030
get more weight and everybody loves that

4125
02:47:56,050 --> 02:47:59,800
good sativa buzz and it's harder to find

4126
02:47:58,030 --> 02:48:01,811
everyone's grown those shorter indicas

4127
02:47:59,800 --> 02:48:02,949
so if you're growing a heady sativa

4128
02:48:01,810 --> 02:48:05,020
you're gonna stand out from the crowd

4129
02:48:02,950 --> 02:48:06,070
medical users are gonna appreciate it

4130
02:48:05,021 --> 02:48:07,841
they're gonna want more recreational

4131
02:48:06,069 --> 02:48:09,251
users are gonna love it they're gonna

4132
02:48:07,841 --> 02:48:12,521
want more so that's gonna help everybody

4133
02:48:09,251 --> 02:48:14,560
out so the basic leaf size is a good

4134
02:48:12,521 --> 02:48:16,061
indicator of how long your strain may

4135
02:48:14,560 --> 02:48:17,199
take from the very beginning if it's

4136
02:48:16,060 --> 02:48:18,520
real broad you're looking at eight to

4137
02:48:17,200 --> 02:48:21,221
nine weeks if you've got some skinny

4138
02:48:18,521 --> 02:48:23,051
leaves go 9 or 10 weeks maybe even a

4139
02:48:21,220 --> 02:48:24,671
little bit longer the thing is if you

4140
02:48:23,050 --> 02:48:27,489
start flushing a little bit too early

4141
02:48:24,671 --> 02:48:28,810
that's ok if you start flushing too late

4142
02:48:27,489 --> 02:48:30,819
that's when you start overdoing things

4143
02:48:28,810 --> 02:48:32,921
it'll be ok so if you've got these

4144
02:48:30,819 --> 02:48:34,421
plants that are gonna end up taking 13

4145
02:48:32,921 --> 02:48:36,399
or 14 weeks and you've already started

4146
02:48:34,421 --> 02:48:38,440
flushing to be prepared for week 11

4147
02:48:36,399 --> 02:48:39,640
you'll be ok they're just gonna start

4148
02:48:38,440 --> 02:48:40,899
looking a little ragged they're gonna

4149
02:48:39,640 --> 02:48:43,511
turn a little bit yellow but they'll

4150
02:48:40,899 --> 02:48:45,251
keep going if you're growing a really

4151
02:48:43,511 --> 02:48:46,631
long sativa something that I should

4152
02:48:45,251 --> 02:48:48,310
mention if you're a new grower and

4153
02:48:46,630 --> 02:48:51,581
you're growing along sativa longer than

4154
02:48:48,310 --> 02:48:53,529
11 weeks you will be lucky if by the end

4155
02:48:51,581 --> 02:48:55,300
of that grow that plant has any big

4156
02:48:53,530 --> 02:48:56,980
leaves left those plants like tip

4157
02:48:55,300 --> 02:48:58,569
they're they're finicky and they will

4158
02:48:56,979 --> 02:49:00,520
lose a lot of leaves they'll look like

4159
02:48:58,569 --> 02:49:02,440
[ __ ] but you'll have amazing medicine

4160
02:49:00,521 --> 02:49:04,211
still because they're Hardy and a plant

4161
02:49:02,440 --> 02:49:06,671
that goes that long is meant to survive

4162
02:49:04,210 --> 02:49:08,770
a lot of experienced growers have a long

4163
02:49:06,671 --> 02:49:10,271
a hard time with a longer flowering play

4164
02:49:08,771 --> 02:49:12,610
because the feeding regimen is kind of

4165
02:49:10,271 --> 02:49:14,230
confusing you're not sure when de-phase

4166
02:49:12,610 --> 02:49:15,730
certain nutrients out and when to face

4167
02:49:14,229 --> 02:49:17,229
Sutent certain nutrients in because

4168
02:49:15,729 --> 02:49:19,449
everything happens at a different time

4169
02:49:17,229 --> 02:49:21,220
than what we're all taught about these

4170
02:49:19,450 --> 02:49:22,541
nine-week plants everybody all the

4171
02:49:21,220 --> 02:49:24,671
nutrient companies that sell you stuff

4172
02:49:22,540 --> 02:49:26,081
most of the stuff you see online or

4173
02:49:24,671 --> 02:49:27,610
they're recommending feeding they're

4174
02:49:26,081 --> 02:49:29,681
basing that on about an eight to nine

4175
02:49:27,610 --> 02:49:31,150
week flowering phase and most of them

4176
02:49:29,681 --> 02:49:32,591
don't even give you enough time to flush

4177
02:49:31,149 --> 02:49:33,970
most tell you to flush for one week

4178
02:49:32,591 --> 02:49:34,780
because they want you to keep plump and

4179
02:49:33,970 --> 02:49:37,060
[ __ ] product

4180
02:49:34,780 --> 02:49:39,311
your plants so my point to all this is

4181
02:49:37,060 --> 02:49:41,351
that you can't really over flush so be

4182
02:49:39,310 --> 02:49:42,851
prepared to flush flush like normal and

4183
02:49:41,351 --> 02:49:45,761
if the plants look like they want longer

4184
02:49:42,851 --> 02:49:47,141
let them go longer you can tell if they

4185
02:49:45,761 --> 02:49:48,489
want to go longer by using the scope

4186
02:49:47,140 --> 02:49:51,039
that's pretty much the only way you can

4187
02:49:48,489 --> 02:49:52,601
get in there and tell also something

4188
02:49:51,040 --> 02:49:54,431
that will give you a hint of how long

4189
02:49:52,601 --> 02:49:56,920
the plants are going to take is the

4190
02:49:54,431 --> 02:49:59,230
basic structure structure my words are

4191
02:49:56,920 --> 02:50:01,780
hard to say today I apologize the basic

4192
02:49:59,229 --> 02:50:03,729
structure of your plants how how tall

4193
02:50:01,780 --> 02:50:06,460
they get how quickly how much they

4194
02:50:03,729 --> 02:50:08,529
branch out how bushy the plant is is it

4195
02:50:06,459 --> 02:50:10,060
growing straight up if that plants going

4196
02:50:08,530 --> 02:50:12,070
straight up and not making a lot of side

4197
02:50:10,060 --> 02:50:13,840
branches you've probably got yourself a

4198
02:50:12,069 --> 02:50:15,789
sativa dominant plant that's gonna take

4199
02:50:13,840 --> 02:50:17,380
a little longer to flower it's just

4200
02:50:15,790 --> 02:50:19,540
gonna keep going straight up if you've

4201
02:50:17,379 --> 02:50:22,089
got a plant that is growing really long

4202
02:50:19,540 --> 02:50:24,070
lanky branches it's just going really

4203
02:50:22,090 --> 02:50:25,899
really fast that plant may take a little

4204
02:50:24,069 --> 02:50:27,940
longer to flower if your plant is

4205
02:50:25,899 --> 02:50:29,649
staying short and stocky and real

4206
02:50:27,940 --> 02:50:32,050
squatty and just getting wider and wider

4207
02:50:29,649 --> 02:50:34,239
as it grows you've probably gotten into

4208
02:50:32,049 --> 02:50:35,680
codominant plant which is also you're

4209
02:50:34,239 --> 02:50:37,869
gonna have to put that treat together

4210
02:50:35,681 --> 02:50:39,431
with your leaf size and kind of put

4211
02:50:37,870 --> 02:50:41,141
those two together and let those two

4212
02:50:39,431 --> 02:50:42,851
things kind of give you hints of how

4213
02:50:41,140 --> 02:50:44,261
much indica and how much sativa and

4214
02:50:42,851 --> 02:50:46,360
those plants and how long you should let

4215
02:50:44,261 --> 02:50:47,829
them go if you've got seeds in the

4216
02:50:46,360 --> 02:50:49,360
breeder pack says that they're done in

4217
02:50:47,829 --> 02:50:51,670
eight to nine weeks I recommend you let

4218
02:50:49,360 --> 02:50:53,620
them go nine weeks maybe even let them

4219
02:50:51,670 --> 02:50:55,060
go a little bit longer if you can I like

4220
02:50:53,620 --> 02:50:56,681
to let stuff go I'm kind of weird I'll

4221
02:50:55,060 --> 02:50:58,511
it I like things to go nine ten or

4222
02:50:56,681 --> 02:51:00,431
eleven weeks just because I it's easier

4223
02:50:58,511 --> 02:51:02,710
to remember I know a lot of strains that

4224
02:51:00,431 --> 02:51:04,810
I run sixty-three days is perfect for

4225
02:51:02,709 --> 02:51:08,140
most of them alright you guys so that is

4226
02:51:04,810 --> 02:51:09,879
basically ways to figure out flowering

4227
02:51:08,140 --> 02:51:11,979
times of new seeds and new clones that

4228
02:51:09,879 --> 02:51:13,989
you've got check the trichomes if you've

4229
02:51:11,979 --> 02:51:16,629
got a scope if you can hook your scope

4230
02:51:13,989 --> 02:51:18,729
up to your computer I recommend you

4231
02:51:16,629 --> 02:51:20,949
check in three places check at the top

4232
02:51:18,729 --> 02:51:23,020
of the plant that big top bud check that

4233
02:51:20,950 --> 02:51:24,280
one check in the middle of the plant so

4234
02:51:23,021 --> 02:51:26,440
you know how you got the top and if you

4235
02:51:24,280 --> 02:51:27,880
didn't do any topping you got a top and

4236
02:51:26,440 --> 02:51:29,471
then there's buds that come up right

4237
02:51:27,879 --> 02:51:31,510
underneath that the next part of the

4238
02:51:29,470 --> 02:51:33,310
crown the next part of the bouquet check

4239
02:51:31,511 --> 02:51:34,840
some of those check like right around

4240
02:51:33,310 --> 02:51:36,310
that ring there and then go down a

4241
02:51:34,840 --> 02:51:38,110
little bit further in the plant and

4242
02:51:36,310 --> 02:51:39,670
check down there and see how the

4243
02:51:38,110 --> 02:51:41,110
difference is going you may be really

4244
02:51:39,670 --> 02:51:43,329
amber down at the bottom you may be

4245
02:51:41,110 --> 02:51:45,400
really clear at the top I like to

4246
02:51:43,329 --> 02:51:46,899
harvest one about 30% of the total

4247
02:51:45,399 --> 02:51:48,579
trichomes of

4248
02:51:46,899 --> 02:51:50,229
started to show amber so it kind of

4249
02:51:48,579 --> 02:51:51,640
looks like you got a little bit of dr.

4250
02:51:50,229 --> 02:51:52,600
pepper autumn or a little bit of root

4251
02:51:51,640 --> 02:51:53,829
beer or something and they're just

4252
02:51:52,601 --> 02:51:56,351
starting to turn a little bit brownish

4253
02:51:53,829 --> 02:51:57,789
if you wait too long they all start

4254
02:51:56,351 --> 02:51:59,739
turning that color I feel like they kind

4255
02:51:57,790 --> 02:52:00,971
of the plants lose their flavor you can

4256
02:51:59,739 --> 02:52:02,500
cut them a little bit earlier they're

4257
02:52:00,970 --> 02:52:04,000
gonna taste better here's part of the

4258
02:52:02,500 --> 02:52:05,560
deal you cut them sooner they taste

4259
02:52:04,000 --> 02:52:07,360
better you cut him a little bit later

4260
02:52:05,560 --> 02:52:09,310
they probably get heavier and more

4261
02:52:07,360 --> 02:52:10,931
potent so that's that's something you

4262
02:52:09,310 --> 02:52:12,729
want to balance on yourself

4263
02:52:10,931 --> 02:52:14,560
most people are focused on getting as

4264
02:52:12,729 --> 02:52:16,899
much as they can from each light or each

4265
02:52:14,560 --> 02:52:18,459
square foot or each square meter or each

4266
02:52:16,899 --> 02:52:19,750
table however you're growing nowadays

4267
02:52:18,459 --> 02:52:21,489
and however you're doing the measurement

4268
02:52:19,750 --> 02:52:23,470
for your own business plan so most

4269
02:52:21,489 --> 02:52:25,750
people want to let it go that extra few

4270
02:52:23,470 --> 02:52:27,159
days and add on that extra bulk and I

4271
02:52:25,750 --> 02:52:29,021
mean you can they just get more potent

4272
02:52:27,159 --> 02:52:31,810
in my opinion as you let them go so guys

4273
02:52:29,021 --> 02:52:33,551
that's mostly ways to kind of

4274
02:52:31,810 --> 02:52:35,289
predetermine how long to let your plants

4275
02:52:33,550 --> 02:52:36,670
flower all right you guys I wrote down a

4276
02:52:35,290 --> 02:52:39,190
couple of more notes that I want to talk

4277
02:52:36,670 --> 02:52:40,899
about that I was inspired to rant on

4278
02:52:39,190 --> 02:52:42,819
because of this topic but before I get

4279
02:52:40,899 --> 02:52:44,199
that far I need a dad I don't need a DAB

4280
02:52:42,819 --> 02:52:45,670
it makes me sound weird when I say that

4281
02:52:44,200 --> 02:52:47,829
I need a dad I felt weird I would love

4282
02:52:45,670 --> 02:52:49,771
to take a DAB with you guys so if you

4283
02:52:47,829 --> 02:52:52,659
were in a safe place where you can smoke

4284
02:52:49,771 --> 02:52:55,721
start getting a DAB ready I'm taking the

4285
02:52:52,659 --> 02:52:58,780
lid off of some golden goat shatter from

4286
02:52:55,720 --> 02:53:00,550
tiara concentrate this golden goat

4287
02:52:58,780 --> 02:53:02,440
shatter is amazing there's very little

4288
02:53:00,550 --> 02:53:05,500
left because I really like it

4289
02:53:02,440 --> 02:53:06,971
I keep ah I keep coming up to the to the

4290
02:53:05,500 --> 02:53:08,229
table or the email is and I'm like I'm

4291
02:53:06,970 --> 02:53:10,119
gonna take a little dab of that golden

4292
02:53:08,229 --> 02:53:11,949
go I just get a little dab of it and I

4293
02:53:10,120 --> 02:53:13,540
take a dad and I get the flavor on my

4294
02:53:11,950 --> 02:53:14,500
mouth but I take the stick a little dab

4295
02:53:13,540 --> 02:53:18,150
that he doesn't really get me high

4296
02:53:14,500 --> 02:53:18,149
because I take a lot of dad a lot of

4297
02:53:21,091 --> 02:53:25,601
take a big I'll take a big then I should

4298
02:53:24,069 --> 02:53:28,091
have just started with a end up really

4299
02:53:25,601 --> 02:53:29,891
high it's funny I like it so this gram

4300
02:53:28,091 --> 02:53:32,409
of golden go shatter has not lasted very

4301
02:53:29,890 --> 02:53:34,479
long at all good job do whoever drew the

4302
02:53:32,409 --> 02:53:37,149
material and then a really good job to

4303
02:53:34,479 --> 02:53:39,789
our friends at tiara concentrates this

4304
02:53:37,149 --> 02:53:41,020
came out wonderfully it is just straight

4305
02:53:39,790 --> 02:53:43,601
shatter I talk about different

4306
02:53:41,021 --> 02:53:46,420
consistencies of hash this is like a

4307
02:53:43,601 --> 02:53:47,891
little pane of glass wrapped in

4308
02:53:46,420 --> 02:53:49,601
parchment it's not that sharp because

4309
02:53:47,890 --> 02:53:51,670
it's more like Jolly Ranchers it's like

4310
02:53:49,601 --> 02:53:53,471
if you had a sheet of Jolly Rancher it

4311
02:53:51,670 --> 02:53:54,610
would just be snappy like this I'm

4312
02:53:53,470 --> 02:53:56,850
trying to fold it back up so that I can

4313
02:53:54,610 --> 02:53:58,891
put this away all right

4314
02:53:56,851 --> 02:54:01,471
onto the dabber I've got the hash put

4315
02:53:58,890 --> 02:54:04,289
away putting it back in my child proof

4316
02:54:01,470 --> 02:54:05,430
child safe container I just like keeping

4317
02:54:04,290 --> 02:54:08,609
in that container because it's labeled

4318
02:54:05,431 --> 02:54:11,069
got a couple of the flavors over here

4319
02:54:08,609 --> 02:54:13,020
all right so we got me a DAB gonna heat

4320
02:54:11,068 --> 02:54:16,409
up the nail right now I'm smoking on a

4321
02:54:13,020 --> 02:54:17,819
quartz banger so let's talk about some

4322
02:54:16,409 --> 02:54:19,260
different nails a lot of times though

4323
02:54:17,818 --> 02:54:20,549
you see me using the email if you for

4324
02:54:19,260 --> 02:54:22,109
watching me on Instagram it's a nail

4325
02:54:20,549 --> 02:54:23,279
it's made out of titanium and it's got a

4326
02:54:22,109 --> 02:54:25,680
cord attached to it and actually

4327
02:54:23,280 --> 02:54:27,569
attaches to a box and that box keeps the

4328
02:54:25,680 --> 02:54:29,398
nail at the appropriate temperature for

4329
02:54:27,568 --> 02:54:30,930
taking dads all the time I'm not using

4330
02:54:29,398 --> 02:54:33,510
that right now it is right here next to

4331
02:54:30,930 --> 02:54:36,479
me it's turned on but I want to use this

4332
02:54:33,510 --> 02:54:38,728
rig that I was that I want so I've got a

4333
02:54:36,478 --> 02:54:41,459
quartz banger it kind of looks like a

4334
02:54:38,728 --> 02:54:43,500
normal bowl like a pipe Bowl or it's

4335
02:54:41,459 --> 02:54:47,129
it's basically just a little dish it's a

4336
02:54:43,500 --> 02:54:49,079
coarse dish its pinky deep it looks like

4337
02:54:47,129 --> 02:54:52,438
a thimble it's almost like a thimble you

4338
02:54:49,079 --> 02:54:53,700
guys but it's quartz and uh so this

4339
02:54:52,439 --> 02:54:55,139
course it's gonna of course it's got a

4340
02:54:53,700 --> 02:54:56,310
little piece that goes into the rig and

4341
02:54:55,139 --> 02:54:58,590
it goes into the rig just kind of like

4342
02:54:56,309 --> 02:54:59,909
where a bong bowl would go and then of

4343
02:54:58,590 --> 02:55:02,460
course I'm using the rigger one from

4344
02:54:59,909 --> 02:55:03,959
elevate it's a pumpkin looking rig so

4345
02:55:02,459 --> 02:55:05,759
with a little pumpkin on the back which

4346
02:55:03,959 --> 02:55:07,228
is the coolest part so I'm gonna heat

4347
02:55:05,760 --> 02:55:10,648
the Banger it's gonna be hard to hear me

4348
02:55:07,228 --> 02:55:14,849
probably while I do that I don't think

4349
02:55:10,648 --> 02:55:16,648
it'll cut this out heat it make sure you

4350
02:55:14,850 --> 02:55:18,540
check out there's a dank team.com

4351
02:55:16,648 --> 02:55:20,159
they've got a fresh crop of ira genetics

4352
02:55:18,540 --> 02:55:23,510
in stock so make sure you check them out

4353
02:55:20,159 --> 02:55:25,530
for feminized and regular cannabis seeds

4354
02:55:23,510 --> 02:55:27,300
just a couple seconds I'm gonna take a

4355
02:55:25,530 --> 02:55:29,489
dab of this golden go and then we'll get

4356
02:55:27,299 --> 02:55:30,599
on with this podcast I do appreciate you

4357
02:55:29,489 --> 02:55:33,260
davon with me I hope you're heating the

4358
02:55:30,600 --> 02:55:36,149
nail right now my nail has got the cool

4359
02:55:33,260 --> 02:55:40,189
clean off some funk so hold the nail

4360
02:55:36,148 --> 02:55:40,189
cool alright guys let's

4361
02:55:41,059 --> 02:55:45,799
here we go is cool let's do this

4362
02:55:47,309 --> 02:55:49,368
you

4363
02:55:49,379 --> 02:55:51,438
you

4364

4365
02:55:59,809 --> 02:56:01,868
you

4366
02:56:02,010 --> 02:56:07,170
that's a pretty big dad maybe bigger

4367
02:56:04,439 --> 02:56:08,430
than I needed for a podcast but what

4368
02:56:07,170 --> 02:56:11,158
could go wrong right I'm just gonna sit

4369
02:56:08,430 --> 02:56:14,850
here talking to a microphone

4370
02:56:11,158 --> 02:56:16,378
oh yeah yes excellent worked my friends

4371
02:56:14,850 --> 02:56:20,189
at ER concentrates this golden goat

4372
02:56:16,379 --> 02:56:22,020
shatter is amaze balls I approve

4373
02:56:20,189 --> 02:56:23,248
all right my head will quit spinning

4374
02:56:22,020 --> 02:56:24,359
here in just a couple of seconds then

4375
02:56:23,248 --> 02:56:26,520
we're gonna move on with the parts that

4376
02:56:24,359 --> 02:56:28,588
I wrote down glad I wrote him down cuz I

4377
02:56:26,520 --> 02:56:29,819
would have forgotten by now let's take

4378
02:56:28,588 --> 02:56:31,559
one last drink here then we'll get on

4379
02:56:29,818 --> 02:56:33,658
with this guys I hope you took a fat dab

4380
02:56:31,559 --> 02:56:34,588
with me if you're dabbing with me while

4381
02:56:33,658 --> 02:56:35,759
we're on the ball you're listening of

4382
02:56:34,588 --> 02:56:37,918
the show send me a tweet let me know

4383
02:56:35,759 --> 02:56:41,068
what you're smoking on tweet me at Qi

4384
02:56:37,918 --> 02:56:42,959
fyh podcast on twitter at g f YH podcast

4385
02:56:41,068 --> 02:56:44,458
I'd love to know that you're smoking

4386
02:56:42,959 --> 02:56:47,069
with me and I'd love to know what you're

4387
02:56:44,459 --> 02:56:49,499
smoking alright so let's get to the

4388
02:56:47,068 --> 02:56:52,198
notes that I wrote down I wrote down

4389
02:56:49,498 --> 02:56:54,539
that phenotype variations will take

4390
02:56:52,199 --> 02:56:57,390
different times to flower which means if

4391
02:56:54,539 --> 02:56:59,219
you buy a package of seeds not every

4392
02:56:57,389 --> 02:57:01,769
seed in that package is going to take

4393
02:56:59,218 --> 02:57:03,748
the same amount of time to flower you

4394
02:57:01,770 --> 02:57:06,238
may get one strain that takes or one

4395
02:57:03,748 --> 02:57:08,338
phenotype that takes nine weeks and you

4396
02:57:06,238 --> 02:57:10,368
may get one phenotype that takes 10

4397
02:57:08,338 --> 02:57:12,418
weeks to flower out of the same package

4398
02:57:10,369 --> 02:57:15,209
now the reason for that all explain a

4399
02:57:12,418 --> 02:57:18,478
little bit why that comes to do when I

4400
02:57:15,209 --> 02:57:22,168
talk about f1 and f2 breeding and f3 and

4401
02:57:18,478 --> 02:57:24,238
f4 when you make an f1 it's got a very

4402
02:57:22,168 --> 02:57:27,359
wide variety of traits it'll bring out

4403
02:57:24,238 --> 02:57:28,978
traits from the mother plant and the

4404
02:57:27,359 --> 02:57:30,719
father plant they were used the female

4405
02:57:28,978 --> 02:57:32,128
and the male so the girl plant they

4406
02:57:30,718 --> 02:57:34,048
receive the pollen and the male plant

4407
02:57:32,129 --> 02:57:37,079
that through pollen those traits are

4408
02:57:34,049 --> 02:57:39,959
gonna show but also the grandparents

4409
02:57:37,078 --> 02:57:42,238
so whatever female you used the male and

4410
02:57:39,959 --> 02:57:44,549
female used for that are going to show

4411
02:57:42,238 --> 02:57:47,009
up in your F wands and whatever you used

4412
02:57:44,549 --> 02:57:49,469
for the male the male and female used to

4413
02:57:47,009 --> 02:57:52,109
make that is gonna show up in your f1

4414
02:57:49,468 --> 02:57:54,328
seeds so you're gonna see grandma you're

4415
02:57:52,109 --> 02:57:55,918
gonna see grandpa and then you're also

4416
02:57:54,328 --> 02:57:57,748
gonna see Grandma and Grandpa on the

4417
02:57:55,918 --> 02:57:59,189
other side and then you're also gonna

4418
02:57:57,748 --> 02:58:00,988
see mommy and you're also gonna see

4419
02:57:59,189 --> 02:58:03,119
daddy so you're gonna have a lot of

4420
02:58:00,988 --> 02:58:05,548
different phenotypes popping up from

4421
02:58:03,119 --> 02:58:08,909
some F once this is a possibility so you

4422
02:58:05,549 --> 02:58:10,649
may get one that takes 8 weeks you may

4423
02:58:08,908 --> 02:58:12,689
get one that takes 10 weeks and this is

4424
02:58:10,648 --> 02:58:15,478
very possible so when you make those F

4425
02:58:12,689 --> 02:58:17,761
ones they there's a lot of variation so

4426
02:58:15,478 --> 02:58:20,729
what we do as breeders we find

4427
02:58:17,761 --> 02:58:23,159
the most desirable female that you can

4428
02:58:20,729 --> 02:58:24,899
find out of all of your seeds out of the

4429
02:58:23,159 --> 02:58:26,220
f wands you want the one that is

4430
02:58:24,899 --> 02:58:27,960
whatever you're looking for the best

4431
02:58:26,220 --> 02:58:29,761
stink or the best growth or the best

4432
02:58:27,960 --> 02:58:31,710
resin you want the best all-around girl

4433
02:58:29,761 --> 02:58:33,750
and then you want to take pollen from

4434
02:58:31,710 --> 02:58:36,479
the male from the same generation and

4435
02:58:33,750 --> 02:58:37,649
throw that pollen onto that girl and the

4436
02:58:36,479 --> 02:58:40,710
seeds that come from there will be

4437
02:58:37,649 --> 02:58:42,449
called f2 f2 s will be a little bit more

4438
02:58:40,710 --> 02:58:44,189
stabilized meaning you're not gonna see

4439
02:58:42,450 --> 02:58:46,261
as much representation of the

4440
02:58:44,190 --> 02:58:47,909
grandparents pop up in the seeds but

4441
02:58:46,261 --> 02:58:49,140
you're gonna see a little bit closer to

4442
02:58:47,909 --> 02:58:51,149
the mommy and daddy and you're gonna

4443
02:58:49,140 --> 02:58:53,609
start narrowing it down a little bit

4444
02:58:51,149 --> 02:58:56,341
more closely to what you're trying to

4445
02:58:53,610 --> 02:58:57,900
make with that seed line something

4446
02:58:56,341 --> 02:58:59,819
interesting that happens with an f2

4447
02:58:57,899 --> 02:59:04,440
cross is called transgressive

4448
02:58:59,819 --> 02:59:07,171
segregation you actually see the the

4449
02:59:04,440 --> 02:59:09,690
kids outperform the parents is generally

4450
02:59:07,171 --> 02:59:11,069
what happens you'll see it'll also go

4451
02:59:09,690 --> 02:59:12,659
the other way also you'll see weaker

4452
02:59:11,069 --> 02:59:16,949
traits also but we call those as

4453
02:59:12,659 --> 02:59:19,470
breeders hopefully so you'll see if you

4454
02:59:16,950 --> 02:59:22,021
put a gigantic male and a gigantic

4455
02:59:19,470 --> 02:59:24,720
female and the male makes super stink

4456
02:59:22,021 --> 02:59:26,400
and the female make super resin you put

4457
02:59:24,720 --> 02:59:29,100
them together you just may make the

4458
02:59:26,399 --> 02:59:30,329
super Hulk buy on your f2s because

4459
02:59:29,101 --> 02:59:32,011
you're gonna see that transgressive

4460
02:59:30,329 --> 02:59:34,710
segregation come through mostly in the

4461
02:59:32,011 --> 02:59:37,620
f2 generation is where I find a bat so

4462
02:59:34,710 --> 02:59:39,600
then I would find my favorite f2 right

4463
02:59:37,620 --> 02:59:41,521
the best looking girl of that f2 that's

4464
02:59:39,601 --> 02:59:43,681
got the traits I'm going after hopefully

4465
02:59:41,521 --> 02:59:44,940
it was very similar to the F ones you

4466
02:59:43,681 --> 02:59:46,140
know what I mean you found the one that

4467
02:59:44,940 --> 02:59:47,399
looked like you were going after and

4468
02:59:46,140 --> 02:59:48,841
then you go find another one that looks

4469
02:59:47,399 --> 02:59:50,609
like that that's an f2 or that's

4470
02:59:48,841 --> 02:59:52,530
improved and then you hit it with the

4471
02:59:50,610 --> 02:59:54,421
pollen from the f2 male now you have to

4472
02:59:52,530 --> 02:59:56,940
find a male and a female and then you

4473
02:59:54,421 --> 02:59:58,470
hit the female with the male pollen and

4474
02:59:56,940 --> 03:00:01,051
when those seeds come out you have now

4475
02:59:58,470 --> 03:00:03,470
made f3 now what I'm getting at is every

4476
03:00:01,050 --> 03:00:05,369
time you do that if you do it correctly

4477
03:00:03,470 --> 03:00:06,689
sometimes you have to go back you have

4478
03:00:05,370 --> 03:00:08,521
to you got to keep a bag of seeds from

4479
03:00:06,690 --> 03:00:10,140
the old ones that go back in Rehan but

4480
03:00:08,521 --> 03:00:12,301
if you do it correctly when you go

4481
03:00:10,140 --> 03:00:14,369
through each time you're going to make

4482
03:00:12,300 --> 03:00:15,810
that strain more stable and more stable

4483
03:00:14,370 --> 03:00:17,370
so you'll start off with like five

4484
03:00:15,810 --> 03:00:19,199
different phenotypes and you breed it

4485
03:00:17,370 --> 03:00:22,261
again and now hopefully you just worked

4486
03:00:19,200 --> 03:00:24,061
it down to like three solid phenotypes

4487
03:00:22,261 --> 03:00:26,790
and then you breed it again and then you

4488
03:00:24,060 --> 03:00:28,409
got two solid phenotypes to where when

4489
03:00:26,790 --> 03:00:29,761
you grow these plants you're 50/50 gonna

4490
03:00:28,409 --> 03:00:30,780
get this one or this one

4491
03:00:29,761 --> 03:00:31,110
you know what I mean that's what it's

4492
03:00:30,780 --> 03:00:33,480
gonna

4493
03:00:31,110 --> 03:00:35,221
you kind of like and then hopefully you

4494
03:00:33,479 --> 03:00:37,350
can breed it down to where by the time

4495
03:00:35,220 --> 03:00:39,539
you get to f5 which takes a long time

4496
03:00:37,351 --> 03:00:40,920
you guys that is years of breeding and

4497
03:00:39,540 --> 03:00:43,261
years of developing because you got to

4498
03:00:40,920 --> 03:00:44,909
find the males and the females and then

4499
03:00:43,261 --> 03:00:46,649
sometimes you don't find what you're

4500
03:00:44,909 --> 03:00:48,511
looking for so you finish a crop and you

4501
03:00:46,649 --> 03:00:51,810
just start over and I actually searched

4502
03:00:48,511 --> 03:00:54,181
through I'd say 250 seats to find inner

4503
03:00:51,810 --> 03:00:56,069
eyes male and I threw away a good

4504
03:00:54,181 --> 03:00:57,390
portion of the females that popped up

4505
03:00:56,069 --> 03:01:00,029
because it wasn't what I needed at the

4506
03:00:57,390 --> 03:01:01,949
time so by the time you get to the f5

4507
03:01:00,030 --> 03:01:03,690
you'll be growing out these seeds and

4508
03:01:01,950 --> 03:01:07,409
they will look like clones if you do it

4509
03:01:03,690 --> 03:01:09,000
correctly five or six if five is about

4510
03:01:07,409 --> 03:01:11,521
where they'll come out really close f6

4511
03:01:09,000 --> 03:01:12,780
will look like clones I wouldn't want to

4512
03:01:11,521 --> 03:01:14,311
take it that far because then nobody

4513
03:01:12,780 --> 03:01:15,811
else could breed to it it would just be

4514
03:01:14,310 --> 03:01:17,699
whatever you bred to it would come out

4515
03:01:15,810 --> 03:01:20,940
looking like that all the time but just

4516
03:01:17,700 --> 03:01:22,230
be real dominant genes so every time you

4517
03:01:20,940 --> 03:01:24,931
breed to it if you do it correctly it

4518
03:01:22,229 --> 03:01:26,430
makes it more stable so what I'm getting

4519
03:01:24,931 --> 03:01:28,560
at is a lot of the breeders on the

4520
03:01:26,431 --> 03:01:31,681
market right now are selling you f1

4521
03:01:28,560 --> 03:01:34,681
which is not a bad thing I appreciate it

4522
03:01:31,681 --> 03:01:36,690
gauge green sells f1 and one of my

4523
03:01:34,681 --> 03:01:38,670
favorite brands to buy is gauge green

4524
03:01:36,690 --> 03:01:40,860
genetics because I love the variation

4525
03:01:38,670 --> 03:01:42,300
that comes in the f1 I get to see a lot

4526
03:01:40,860 --> 03:01:44,460
of neat stuff I actually had the honour

4527
03:01:42,300 --> 03:01:46,319
of being a tester for gauge green so I

4528
03:01:44,459 --> 03:01:48,329
get to see a lot of great [ __ ] come out

4529
03:01:46,319 --> 03:01:49,079
of their garden I got to test a lot of

4530
03:01:48,329 --> 03:01:51,780
great seeds

4531
03:01:49,079 --> 03:01:54,360
I love F ones because of that so you may

4532
03:01:51,780 --> 03:01:56,130
get an f1 that takes 8 weeks you may get

4533
03:01:54,360 --> 03:01:58,051
an f1 that takes 9 weeks from the same

4534
03:01:56,129 --> 03:01:59,430
exact pack of seeds now you've got a

4535
03:01:58,050 --> 03:02:01,379
decision to make do you want to cut that

4536
03:01:59,431 --> 03:02:03,181
one down early and change your feet and

4537
03:02:01,379 --> 03:02:04,920
regimen and have two different plants

4538
03:02:03,181 --> 03:02:06,960
that you've got to feed or do you just

4539
03:02:04,920 --> 03:02:10,829
want to let them all go

4540
03:02:06,959 --> 03:02:12,270
60 days sixty-four days 56 days it's up

4541
03:02:10,829 --> 03:02:14,459
to you you get to decide that stuff but

4542
03:02:12,271 --> 03:02:16,290
that's a decision you've got to make if

4543
03:02:14,459 --> 03:02:18,659
you can tell early on and flower that

4544
03:02:16,290 --> 03:02:20,730
one is kind of taking off and getting a

4545
03:02:18,659 --> 03:02:22,409
little bit taller than the others I mean

4546
03:02:20,729 --> 03:02:23,819
you may have some thinking to do right

4547
03:02:22,409 --> 03:02:26,579
at the beginning there that may give you

4548
03:02:23,819 --> 03:02:28,739
a hint so different seeds are the same

4549
03:02:26,579 --> 03:02:30,989
seed packet different phenotypes you may

4550
03:02:28,739 --> 03:02:32,341
have different flowering times I really

4551
03:02:30,989 --> 03:02:34,319
love searching through seed packs and

4552
03:02:32,341 --> 03:02:35,220
finding the phenotypes because depending

4553
03:02:34,319 --> 03:02:37,020
on what you're working with

4554
03:02:35,220 --> 03:02:38,970
you may find some really great [ __ ] you

4555
03:02:37,021 --> 03:02:40,920
may also find some ridiculous stuff but

4556
03:02:38,970 --> 03:02:43,159
in the same pack I found completely

4557
03:02:40,920 --> 03:02:44,840
purple buds that were sure and

4558
03:02:43,159 --> 03:02:46,610
Packt and plants make purple bright

4559
03:02:44,840 --> 03:02:50,930
purple buzz and I've also had plants

4560
03:02:46,610 --> 03:02:52,610
that make tall velvety bright green buds

4561
03:02:50,930 --> 03:02:54,319
and I couldn't decide which phenotype to

4562
03:02:52,610 --> 03:02:57,021
keep so I kept them both and I called

4563
03:02:54,319 --> 03:02:59,029
them just different phenotypes so female

4564
03:02:57,021 --> 03:03:02,061
hunting is I really love it that's one

4565
03:02:59,030 --> 03:03:03,440
of my favorite things to do so expect

4566
03:03:02,060 --> 03:03:06,020
some variation also something I wrote

4567
03:03:03,440 --> 03:03:09,560
down is different flowering times in

4568
03:03:06,021 --> 03:03:11,870
different rooms and environments so if I

4569
03:03:09,560 --> 03:03:13,159
gave you clones if I gave you clones and

4570
03:03:11,870 --> 03:03:14,690
I gave one of your other friends clones

4571
03:03:13,159 --> 03:03:16,101
and I gave a couple other guys clones

4572
03:03:14,690 --> 03:03:21,620
and you guys all took it to your Dro

4573
03:03:16,101 --> 03:03:24,409
room you may see your room wants these

4574
03:03:21,620 --> 03:03:27,170
plants to flower in 58 days they may be

4575
03:03:24,409 --> 03:03:29,899
perfectly finished in 58 days if I give

4576
03:03:27,170 --> 03:03:32,060
somebody else plants they may need 63

4577
03:03:29,899 --> 03:03:34,340
days if we're getting right down to it

4578
03:03:32,060 --> 03:03:37,489
so environmental can have a lot to do

4579
03:03:34,340 --> 03:03:39,049
with it you guys also indoors and

4580
03:03:37,489 --> 03:03:41,149
outdoors you're gonna see huge

4581
03:03:39,049 --> 03:03:42,619
differences in different areas our buds

4582
03:03:41,149 --> 03:03:44,029
are gonna look completely different if

4583
03:03:42,620 --> 03:03:46,130
we're growing them in California if

4584
03:03:44,030 --> 03:03:48,200
we're growing them in Colorado altitudes

4585
03:03:46,129 --> 03:03:49,459
make a huge difference environmental

4586
03:03:48,200 --> 03:03:53,180
factors like that will play a huge

4587
03:03:49,459 --> 03:03:54,529
difference in your flowering times yeah

4588
03:03:53,180 --> 03:03:56,720
alright I think I've gone long enough

4589
03:03:54,530 --> 03:03:57,891
you guys we're at 32 minutes now so I

4590
03:03:56,719 --> 03:03:59,359
think I'm gonna wrap up the recording

4591
03:03:57,890 --> 03:04:00,920
ladies and gentlemen I appreciate you

4592
03:03:59,360 --> 03:04:02,239
for listening to this long of an episode

4593
03:04:00,920 --> 03:04:03,440
of just me ranting it feels like I'm

4594
03:04:02,239 --> 03:04:05,329
talking for a long time when I do a

4595
03:04:03,440 --> 03:04:07,760
30-minute episode by myself so I truly

4596
03:04:05,329 --> 03:04:09,049
appreciate you guys hanging on for it if

4597
