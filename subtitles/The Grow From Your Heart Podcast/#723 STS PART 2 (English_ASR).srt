thiosulfate part two

166
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:59,120
most of these questions came from emails

167
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,360
from the youtube channel uh through the

168
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,879
irie genetics grow help tab on the

169
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,560
website check out the website there's a

170
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:06,000
tab there that says grow help if you

171
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,280
have questions about anything you can

172
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,038
reach me through there just skip the

173
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:10,239
grow help part type in your question at

174
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:12,318
the bottom i'll still get that i will

175
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,000
still answer that if i have not answered

176
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,479
your email or your tester application

177
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,160
once again i do apologize it's just me

178
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:19,519
going to stay on track

179
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,080
a lot of the questions were about

180
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:24,318
storing the solution we would mix up

181
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:26,879
part a mix up part b then mix them into

182
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,960
a solution then we would dilute that

183
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:31,519
there were many questions about storage

184
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:34,318
here is the straightforward answer it is

185
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:36,000
best to okay it will last longest i

186
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,160
think is the way that i should say this

187
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,478
for best preservation of the product it

188
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,720
will last longest in the powder form

189
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:45,918
once we mix it into the waters we are

190
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,600
the water uh we are now reducing the

191
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:50,159
shelf life of that product once we

192
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,800
combine those two sources together we

193
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,400
are now even greatly more reducing the

194
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,319
shelf life of that product once we

195
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:58,638
dilute it we have even more drastically

196
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,479
reduced the shelf life of that product

197
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:03,280
so every time we dilute it every time we

198
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:05,598
mix it we're kind of reducing the shelf

199
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:08,159
life and the viability of that product

200
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:09,680
so what i recommend is i mix up one

201
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,840
liter i know that one liter is going to

202
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,598
get me through my multiple days of

203
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:15,119
spraying my multiple applications i can

204
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:17,680
spray several plants several times

205
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,079
several days by mixing up one liter that

206
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,759
one liter recipe is really easy to make

207
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:23,839
the recipe is simple the amount of water

208
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,439
you need the measuring equipment 500

209
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:27,198
mils uh the half gram two and a half

210
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:29,038
grams the math works out very well and

211
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:32,639
that's about how much i need to get my

212
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:34,639
reversals done so i make that one liter

213
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,720
that one liter stores long enough to get

214
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:39,280
me through the 21 days worth of

215
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,599
application without having any problems

216
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:43,279
if you do see uh discoloration or

217
00:07:41,598 --> 00:07:45,519
coloration i guess any sort of color

218
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:47,598
happening in there sometimes you'll see

219
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:50,079
dark granules or black chunks at the

220
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:52,478
bottom of the the mix that's probably

221
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:55,038
bad you need to pour that out and remix

222
00:07:52,478 --> 00:07:57,120
so i don't have a tried and true shelf

223
00:07:55,038 --> 00:07:58,719
life for this product what i do know is

224
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,319
that when i make that leader and i throw

225
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,520
that leader in the refrigerator that's

226
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,720
something we're going to talk about here

227
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:04,560
is storage

228
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,479
i keep it in a refrigerator and it is

229
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,280
clearly labeled it's a big jar and it

230
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:11,120
says silver thio sulfate solution on it

231
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:12,878
to where nobody in my house it's just me

232
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,038
here but i make sure that nobody that

233
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,560
shows up comes over is going to drink

234
00:08:15,038 --> 00:08:18,959
out of that maybe mike comes over takes

235
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,720
a giant dab maybe clint pops by uh he

236
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:22,478
doesn't dab because he's kind of not

237
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,240
that cool yet but maybe he hits the dab

238
00:08:22,478 --> 00:08:25,359
pen and he gets a little fuzzy and he

239
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,960
goes to the fridge and needs something

240
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,400
cold to drink i want to make sure none

241
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:30,318
of my crew none of my friends none of my

242
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:32,799
family reach into my refrigerator and

243
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,320
drink the silver thiosulfate solution i

244
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:36,240
don't think it would cause them drastic

245
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,879
health problems i don't want to find out

246
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,799
so it is clearly labeled in the fridge

247
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:42,879
keep it in a cool dry dark place if you

248
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:44,479
can put it in a brown paper bag like

249
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:45,919
some bum wine just put your clear jar in

250
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,759
a brown bag that will protect it from

251
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:49,120
the light uh the light is off in the

252
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:50,480
fridge when you close the door the light

253
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,159
goes off i don't [ __ ] with the fridge a

254
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,800
lot i'm a single i'm not a single dude

255
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:56,159
i'm a bachelor living alone um

256
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:58,399
here by myself the fridge doesn't get

257
00:08:56,159 --> 00:09:01,120
opened a lot so uh it stays nice and

258
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:03,839
cool dry and dark in there so honestly

259
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:06,000
it is uh it's effective for me over that

260
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:07,519
course of 21 days it does not lose its

261
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,039
strength it does not lose its uh

262
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,679
viability it does not lose its

263
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:14,159
effectiveness over that 21 day period

264
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:16,239
while it is kept in my fridge so what i

265
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:17,919
do is i'll take the the one uh the

266
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,519
leader i'll take out the amount that i

267
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:20,240
need put that in my spray bottle dilute

268
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,799
it

269
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,480
usually i can get two applications from

270
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:26,559
one spray bottle worth i'm using just

271
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,159
the spray bottle that uh you probably

272
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:30,719
use to put cleaner in and spray the

273
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:32,559
windows or some sort of just a basic

274
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,720
spray bottles i think it's 450

275
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:36,559
milliliters is what it's marked up to on

276
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,879
the side of the bottle i can get two

277
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:41,199
applications of three semi-large plants

278
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:43,120
out of that one bottle so

279
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,720
i mix it i dilute it i mix it i fill

280
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,720
that bottle i shake the [ __ ] out of it i

281
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,240
spray i leave that bottle sitting in a

282
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,320
cool dry dark place it's honestly in

283
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,000
just my mix area when i'm not in there

284
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,000
the lights in the mix area are off it's

285
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,360
cool it's dry it's dark

286
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,639
it's a comfortable environment for a

287
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,320
person i think that would be a decent

288
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:00,319
environment for that solution it sits

289
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,000
there ah three days later i shake the

290
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,519
[ __ ] out of it again apply it to the

291
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,600
plants know my spray bottle is empty at

292
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,879
that time i'll clean it out uh when it's

293
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,839
time to make more i will make the

294
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:11,838
dilution i'll pour my 10 or 30 whatever

295
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,240
percent into the container uh then i'll

296
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,160
mix the 70 or 90 percent dilu distilled

297
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,759
water into there shake the [ __ ] out of

298
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:20,000
it then i can get once again two more

299
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:22,399
applications out of that uh by the time

300
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,919
that jar that mix is getting empty i

301
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,120
have my plants are done they're reversed

302
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:26,639
they're getting cut down it's already

303
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,679
done the magic so

304
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:30,399
um

305
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:32,399
the storage they store best as powders

306
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:34,559
they store a little less longer every

307
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,958
time you mix them and dilute them they

308
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:38,319
start to lose their um their shelf life

309
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:40,239
is i'm not a scientist i'm not a

310
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,560
chemistry major to be 100 honest with

311
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,079
you but in my experience uh from the

312
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,838
best of my knowledge from what i've been

313
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:48,078
taught read and learned

314
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:49,920
they do last longest as the powder

315
00:10:48,078 --> 00:10:52,399
shorter as they get wetter and more

316
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:54,240
diluted more dissolved so um keep them

317
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,240
in the fridge i keep them in a cool dry

318
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,000
dark place clearly labeled make sure

319
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,519
that once again if you have family if

320
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,440
you got kids especially if you've got

321
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,039
kids this may be

322
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,720
a weird detail if somebody if you if

323
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:06,159
somebody in your house drinks alcohol

324
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,480
that's when we make a lot of silly

325
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:10,240
mistakes we do a lot of weird [ __ ] maybe

326
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,759
put it somewhere that you cannot

327
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,360
accidentally drink it if you're drunk

328
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:14,958
put it in the bottom somewhere in the

329
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,959
crisper drawer in the bottom somewhere

330
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:18,399
you just won't get to it set yourself up

331
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:20,559
for success is what i'm saying we don't

332
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,559
want to be that grower that breeder that

333
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:24,239
seed maker that that [ __ ] getting

334
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:26,239
somebody sick because we didn't properly

335
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,560
label and or store the things we're

336
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,480
using for our grow so put that in a safe

337
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:32,559
designated place make sure it's labeled

338
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,120
also keep in mind drunk people young

339
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:37,359
people uh sometimes old people sometimes

340
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,440
normal people can't [ __ ] read so set

341
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,039
yourself up your home up for success

342
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,800
i've seen people take a ring of duct

343
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:43,838
tape and put it right around the top uh

344
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:45,039
just because when people grab they're

345
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,480
going why the [ __ ] is there duct tape

346
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:48,078
around here that'll slow them down make

347
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,240
them think not to drink the silver

348
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:52,638
sulfate solution i don't keep mine for

349
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:55,039
very long i use it and i make more i

350
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:57,278
keep that 100 percent solution in a in

351
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:59,519
the refrigerator and i dilute it as i

352
00:11:57,278 --> 00:12:02,078
need it i apply it usually i can get two

353
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:05,759
sprays out of a solution out of a mix

354
00:12:02,078 --> 00:12:08,239
and that is basically the storage of the

355
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:10,720
silver thiosulfate solutions now let's

356
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:13,039
move forward i spray with the lights off

357
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,278
one of the questions was when do i spray

358
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:17,439
i try to spray any spray application

359
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:19,439
with the lights off this doesn't matter

360
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,959
if you've got to turn it's best if you

361
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,800
can hit it right when the lights go off

362
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:24,319
in the grow space if you can time it to

363
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:26,559
where like you know the lights go off at

364
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,320
seven you're in there at like 6 59 you

365
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:30,159
start spraying those lights go off and

366
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,360
then you can finish spraying close up

367
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:32,719
and get out of there real quick that's

368
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,320
not a problem that couple of minutes

369
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,240
worth spraying those uh plants with

370
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,320
silver won't disrupt anything if you

371
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,480
could pull the plants out just before

372
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,399
night time take them to another location

373
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,920
and spray them then right as the lights

374
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,600
go off return them to their home and

375
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:47,838
then let them sleep that is probably

376
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,680
best so i always spray with the lights

377
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:50,959
off if the plants are removed from the

378
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:52,479
grow lights or you just don't want them

379
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:53,679
under those intense lights for a couple

380
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,720
of reasons

381
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:56,399
um

382
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,320
remember when we were kids some of us

383
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,759
did this some didn't you could burn if

384
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,200
you watched beavis and butthead you saw

385
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:03,600
this you could burn ants with a

386
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,879
magnifying glass if you get a bubble on

387
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,959
your leaf when you're spraying with the

388
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:08,320
big grow light on and that intense light

389
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:10,319
hits that bubble it could make a little

390
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,959
burn mark on your plant also there's a

391
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,959
thing called photo toxicity sometimes

392
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:16,719
the things we spray on our plants may

393
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:18,319
have a photo reaction with the light

394
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,560
with the heat something may cause an

395
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,920
interaction to cause a problem on your

396
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:23,919
plants so let's not spray with the

397
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:25,199
lights on if you can drag those plants

398
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:26,719
out of there spray them right before the

399
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,920
lights go off right as the lights go off

400
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,120
put them back in the room so they're not

401
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:31,120
getting hit with that big light while

402
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,679
they're wet that would be ideal be

403
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,759
careful not to get the silver solution

404
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:37,439
on other plants you only want this on

405
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:38,799
plants that are going to get sprayed if

406
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,120
you're putting them in a room with other

407
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:43,359
plants make sure that those plants that

408
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,600
the sprayed plants are dry before you

409
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:48,480
introduce them back to the population

410
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,440
another thing is i usually spray and

411
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,039
then

412
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,800
that first time i spray is about seven

413
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:55,120
to ten days before a flower so that one

414
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:57,439
i just spray lights go out i spray we're

415
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,679
in veg not a big deal once i go into

416
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,440
flower i will wait so my i've got my

417
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:03,439
room set to 12 12. it's going to come on

418
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,199
at 9 00 a.m or 9 p.m however you're

419
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,320
living it comes on right so that light

420
00:14:05,198 --> 00:14:07,599
will come on whenever you've got it

421
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,440
scheduled i don't know how your setup is

422
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,959
going uh the lights come on boom the

423
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,360
plant's in there this is its first day

424
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:15,439
of 12 12. when i know that that timer is

425
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,600
about to go off maybe 10 15 minutes

426
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,680
before that i'll go grab that plant pull

427
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,680
it far from the light and spray it now

428
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:23,198
this is day one for that plant so i'm

429
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:25,039
going to spray it with a silver solution

430
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:26,559
let it kind of dry up then when the

431
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:28,000
lights go off i'll just move it back to

432
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:29,838
its normal spot so that tomorrow when

433
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,559
the light comes on it's back in its home

434
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:34,240
that is its first day i like to spray it

435
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:36,078
right before the lights go off then put

436
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,639
it into darkness give it that first day

437
00:14:36,078 --> 00:14:40,879
of darkness right after that spray that

438
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,320
seems to work for me that seems to be

439
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:44,958
effective that is the way i've been

440
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,720
doing it so that is when um so we've

441
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:48,159
covered storage of the solution we've

442
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,440
covered when to spray spray with the

443
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:51,120
lights off

444
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,480
spray in the dark make sure not to spray

445
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,000
the other plants if you've got to pull

446
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,240
these plants out of the room and spray

447
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,679
them that may be ideal

448
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,198
that should be what you're doing anyway

449
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:00,638
because you want to flower these plants

450
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:02,078
a little bit ahead of the females we're

451
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,560
going to talk more about that that may

452
00:15:02,078 --> 00:15:05,838
be getting close to where we are um so

453
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:07,518
you want to get these male plants in a

454
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,519
room by themselves if you can or the

455
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,959
pollen donor plants i should say in a

456
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:12,879
room by themselves if you can and get

457
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:14,958
them ahead of the girls when making

458
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:16,639
femme seeds let's talk about one of the

459
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:18,958
big questions we got was pollen

460
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:21,120
collection and storage of the pollen

461
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:23,359
that is a really good question our main

462
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,639
goal here is to create feminized pollen

463
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,720
what are we gonna do with the pollen

464
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:28,560
once we've created that

465
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,639
um what i do

466
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:33,119
i've got two separate areas

467
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:35,198
i've got a main room with a three by

468
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:38,000
three tent inside of that room so my

469
00:15:35,198 --> 00:15:39,278
girls are in one area they're vegging uh

470
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,519
they're under a light they're getting

471
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:43,198
vegged then i will move my male plant

472
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:44,959
into the tent or my pollen donor i

473
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:47,039
should correct my nomenclature my worded

474
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:48,719
cheer my verbiage uh this is a pollen

475
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:50,958
donor it's a female being moved to a

476
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,399
tent three of them get moved to a tent

477
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:55,359
uh they are on their own light now i'll

478
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:56,720
put them under 1212 and spray them um

479
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,199
they're going to start making pollen

480
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:01,920
you've got a couple of options what i do

481
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:04,159
i grab those pollen donor plants uh when

482
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:06,159
i know it's about time i grab them and i

483
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:07,838
move them strategically throughout the

484
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:10,159
grow space one goes right in the middle

485
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:11,279
of all the females one goes on this end

486
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:13,120
of the females because there's an

487
00:16:11,278 --> 00:16:15,278
extraction fan on this end so i wanted

488
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,560
to kind of pull the air right over there

489
00:16:15,278 --> 00:16:18,480
and the other one kind of sits off to

490
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:20,000
the side because i'm saving that one i

491
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,759
want that one to make a bunch of pollen

492
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,039
so that that's my back up my second

493
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:26,560
pollination so um you can just put one

494
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:28,319
at the edge of the plants at the edge of

495
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:30,479
the canopy and just let that pollen dust

496
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,240
in or you can collect the pollen if you

497
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,759
want to collect it keep the males in

498
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,759
their own area the pollen donors in

499
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:38,720
their own area and as the pollen starts

500
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:40,480
coming out you can tap it i use often

501
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,320
times i'll get a pyrex dish it's going

502
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,399
to be heavy a pyrex dish is much heavier

503
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,920
than you anticipate get a good grip on

504
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,440
it don't drop that bad [ __ ] in the

505
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:49,439
grill you'll break some stuff maybe even

506
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,600
the dish it will suck so i've got the

507
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,199
pyrex dish i've got a grip on it i'm a

508
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,519
drummer i've got a drumstick handy i'll

509
00:16:53,198 --> 00:16:57,599
grab a drumstick and just tap that plant

510
00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:00,000
and it'll tap the pollen right into that

511
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,600
into that pyrex dish just give it a few

512
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,440
taps you can do this every few days it

513
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,199
will start giving you pollen it'll make

514
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,199
more pollen just know that every time

515
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,880
you touch this plant pollen is going to

516
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,919
go all over the place there's going to

517
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,679
be pollen everywhere you're going to

518
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,600
sneeze it's going to taste gross it's

519
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,679
going to get in your eyes it'll be funky

520
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:17,359
so you can drag that

521
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:19,038
pollen donor over to the rest of the

522
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:21,279
plant over the population when you're

523
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:24,078
ready or you can collect the pollen by

524
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:25,759
tapping it or you can take that pyrex

525
00:17:24,078 --> 00:17:27,599
dish and you can straight up chop the

526
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:29,679
tops off of your plant your pollen donor

527
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:31,678
plant and lay it in that pyrex dish and

528
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:33,840
the pollen will fall out as the plant

529
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:35,200
dries pollen will land into your dish

530
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:37,119
you could tap it you could tap it with a

531
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,720
drumstick with your fingers smack the

532
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:40,079
plant onto the dish carefully gently

533
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,519
don't blow the pollen everywhere it's

534
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:43,839
sensitive the wind will make you go

535
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:46,480
crazy tap it tap that plant onto the

536
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:48,319
dish the pollen will fall out

537
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:52,480
one of the most important things about

538
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:53,839
pollen is let it get dry moisture will

539
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,679
destroy pollen that's something we're

540
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:58,079
going to talk about a lot here

541
00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:01,038
moisture destroys pollen if you have got

542
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:03,279
a desiccant pack not a boveda pack you

543
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:05,440
want the opposite boveda helps you

544
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:08,240
retain moisture we want to eliminate

545
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:10,160
moisture that thing that comes in food

546
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,839
like beef jerky and [ __ ] to suck out the

547
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,759
moisture it'll come in your vitamin

548
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:15,279
package it comes in sometimes if you buy

549
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:17,200
a new bag or something it'll come with

550
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:19,279
this little packet that is to suck out

551
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,038
moisture that's what we want moisture

552
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:23,440
will destroy pollen it'll make your

553
00:18:21,038 --> 00:18:25,279
pollen clumpy it'll make it dark yellow

554
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,558
it will not be viable so let's get it

555
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:28,798
super dry

556
00:18:26,558 --> 00:18:30,399
also before you store it pick out all of

557
00:18:28,798 --> 00:18:32,240
those male flowers you're going to see

558
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,798
little male flower clusters in there get

559
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,319
all of those out because those

560
00:18:34,798 --> 00:18:38,558
have moisture and they will harbor

561
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:40,720
moisture which will uh attribute and

562
00:18:38,558 --> 00:18:42,960
contribute to moldy conditions in your

563
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,640
storage container so gather up that

564
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,880
pollen you can use the drumstick and the

565
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,720
pyrex dish method you can just bend that

566
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,160
plant over and shake it into your dish

567
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,079
if that's what you want to do but pollen

568
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,320
is going to go every direction when you

569
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:55,678
do this turn off the fans

570
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:57,839
help yourself out because that fan is

571
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,120
going to blow dust everywhere or if you

572
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:00,720
think that the plant has gone long

573
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:02,959
enough you can cut the tops off and put

574
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:05,759
those tops in the dish and let them dry

575
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:07,440
get it bone dry before you seal it up

576
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:09,038
then store that pollen i don't know how

577
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,120
long your pollen will last i've done a

578
00:19:09,038 --> 00:19:12,720
few experiments i don't want to lead you

579
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:14,719
astray and say that it will last more

580
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,798
than six months i've had pollen for six

581
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,798
months i've had pollen for a year and it

582
00:19:16,798 --> 00:19:21,200
worked i had pollen for two years it did

583
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:23,759
not work so i'm gonna say gather your

584
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:28,000
pollen get it super dry seal it keep it

585
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:31,440
in a cool dry dark place dry dry did i

586
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,960
say dry enough times get the pollen dry

587
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,279
all right now we've got pollen let's

588
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:37,519
talk about actually pollinating our

589
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:39,678
female plants like i said before you

590
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:41,918
could drag your uh your reversed plant

591
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,280
your pollen donor over to the canopy you

592
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:45,440
can give it a shake or you can let it

593
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:47,279
naturally blow across the canopy let it

594
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,840
pollinate that way

595
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:51,839
or you can select a couple of branches

596
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:53,918
for your female plant and pollinate just

597
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:55,678
a few branches if

598
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,520
you're very careful

599
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:00,080
i would have the pollen in a small

600
00:19:57,519 --> 00:20:01,599
container maybe like a glass vial back

601
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:04,319
in the day we would use a black film

602
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:06,000
canister we've evolved since then but a

603
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:07,279
vial a container of some sort with

604
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,519
pollen in it

605
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:11,678
if you can remove the female plant that

606
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:13,679
you're going to pollinate from the room

607
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:16,559
once you've got your female pollen

608
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:18,320
receiver in a safe place get the pollen

609
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:20,558
out of your container you can use a

610
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:21,918
q-tip you can use a paintbrush i've seen

611
00:20:20,558 --> 00:20:24,798
a lot of different ways to do it i've

612
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:26,400
seen people simply take a vial of pollen

613
00:20:24,798 --> 00:20:28,079
and sprinkle it right over the top of

614
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,480
the plant like if this microphone was a

615
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:32,319
plant and this uh i'm gonna use the pen

616
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,240
it's the easiest thing i've got this pen

617
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:36,158
cap was a vial of pollen they just took

618
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,679
it and went tink tink tink tink and did

619
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:39,679
a few circles around it and then went

620
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:41,360
lower or you can just pollinate one

621
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:43,440
branch if you're super careful you can

622
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:46,798
grab a branch of the plant bend it over

623
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:48,880
this way get it right here and just go

624
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:50,240
and then you know that this branch right

625
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,919
here is going to make a bunch of seeds

626
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:55,120
you can make plenty of seeds from a

627
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:56,880
really small bud a really small branch a

628
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:59,038
good idea at this point maybe to mark it

629
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,880
if you got a bread tie a ribbon

630
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:03,038
anything you can put on this branch and

631
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,159
say this is where i pollinated now you

632
00:21:03,038 --> 00:21:05,919
know that your seeds are going to be

633
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:07,600
there when it comes to harvest time you

634
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,600
could possibly harvest the rest of the

635
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:11,599
plant if you were careful it won't be

636
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:13,279
seeded and this one branch will have

637
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:15,119
seeds for your next project you can grow

638
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:17,519
your own stuff have a little bit of fun

639
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:19,199
with that so you can use a paintbrush a

640
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:20,960
q-tip you could dust it you could dip

641
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,880
the paint brush or q-tip into the pollen

642
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,798
and paint it onto the bud paint the

643
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:27,840
pistols watch the pistols is that where

644
00:21:24,798 --> 00:21:29,599
we are um yeah watch the pistols

645
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:31,119
when those pistols get

646
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:33,119
you can identify that the plant has been

647
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:35,519
pollinated by the pistols or stigmas

648
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:37,519
being brown and shriveled

649
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:39,279
that part will become a seed and then it

650
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:41,918
says you can make a lot of seeds with

651
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:43,839
tiny tiny plants don't waste a lot of

652
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:45,440
time and space making seeds for your

653
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:47,279
first time we don't know if these seeds

654
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,360
are going to be any good so the first

655
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:51,519
time you make seeds maybe only make 20

656
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:53,439
30 maybe 50 of them to test them out see

657
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:55,038
if they're worth a [ __ ] don't seed up

658
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,200
your whole crop and then they got a

659
00:21:55,038 --> 00:21:59,519
bunch of seeds that aren't stellar our

660
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,279
job as a breeder is to make seeds that

661
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:02,720
are better than both of the parents if

662
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:04,639
you didn't improve upon the cannabis

663
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,240
line or if you didn't reach a goal that

664
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,759
you were trying to reach then we didn't

665
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,200
do ourselves any justice we didn't do

666
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:12,240
any good for the plant we're moving

667
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:14,880
backwards so um you can make yourselves

668
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:17,038
a lot of seeds in a very small like a

669
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,600
closet or a micro grow space you can

670
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:21,440
make a lot of seeds i've bred seeds in

671
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:23,119
six inch net pots all you need is a big

672
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,519
enough plant to receive pollen and a big

673
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:28,239
enough plant to drop pollen you can make

674
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:29,918
seeds so pollinate some plants let the

675
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,558
pollen take

676
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:35,120
then here's a useful tip i keep saying

677
00:22:32,558 --> 00:22:36,960
water deactivates pollen when you are

678
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:38,959
tossing pollen around if you don't want

679
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,400
all of your plants to get pollen spray

680
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,000
them with water before you get the

681
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,080
pollen out just moisten them up make it

682
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,079
damp in the room wet those plants get

683
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:48,240
the other plants do your pollen chucking

684
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:50,000
let the pollen take maybe rinse that

685
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,000
plant off after the pot just mist it

686
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,400
with water kill any excess pollen that

687
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,319
didn't get absorbed by the pistols or uh

688
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,080
by the female plant get the pollen off

689
00:22:56,319 --> 00:22:59,439
of there then spray the other females

690
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:01,199
then put everybody back in the room

691
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,960
together and then you should prevent

692
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,720
pollen contamination on the plants you

693
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,558
did not want seeded

694
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,720
water deactivates pollen there are so

695
00:23:06,558 --> 00:23:10,798
many useful tricks to use water to keep

696
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,240
your other plants safe so you can spray

697
00:23:10,798 --> 00:23:13,918
the other females

698
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,240
you can spray anything you don't want to

699
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,759
get seeded that may help you out so

700
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,120
rinse them off before you put them back

701
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:21,200
in there spray the other girls you

702
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:22,479
should be safe now here's something i

703
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,200
want to talk about

704
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,640
don't harvest the seeds too early how do

705
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,000
we know when they're done the seeds will

706
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,480
probably take

707
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:34,000
about six weeks to finish i usually

708
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:36,400
harvest around day 70 sometimes 77 when

709
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
my plants are seeded what i like to do

710
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:41,200
to make sure that my seeds are ready is

711
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,359
i start doing what i call a squeeze test

712
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:46,000
i seed up pretty large plants so i've i

713
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:47,759
can risk a few seeds what i do uh right

714
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,599
where the uh the nodes are kind of

715
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:51,759
intersecting right at the bottom you can

716
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:53,359
see the bracks the uh the pistols or the

717
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:55,119
cat you can see the bracks of the calyx

718
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:57,038
all swell swelling up and there's a seed

719
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:58,319
in there just reach up and pluck a seed

720
00:23:57,038 --> 00:24:00,400
out you're not gonna ruin too much you

721
00:23:58,319 --> 00:24:02,639
might pull out one or two seeds pull out

722
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,320
a seed give it a squeeze roll it around

723
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,880
in your fingers knock off that hole or

724
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:09,359
the husk of the seed examine the seed

725
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:11,120
what color is it is it white is it light

726
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:13,439
green is it turning brown is it tiger

727
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:15,839
striped is it gray does it look like a

728
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:18,240
seed that you think would be viable then

729
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:20,240
here's the next test give it a squeeze

730
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,079
that seed should not break under the

731
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,079
pressure of your fingers if it cracks

732
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:26,399
it's not ready if it does not crack

733
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:27,918
you're getting very close i like to pull

734
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,679
the seeds when they're good and hard and

735
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:31,520
i can push them on the table and they do

736
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:34,159
not rupture under the pressure of my

737
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:36,319
finger i've got a nice i almost have an

738
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:38,480
indention and a callus on this finger

739
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:40,399
from pressing so many seeds onto this

740
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,319
table that's how i test them i really

741
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,798
pull out a few and i'll do this from

742
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:46,720
multiple locations on the plant i don't

743
00:24:44,798 --> 00:24:48,319
just pick the top because that's obvious

744
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,319
right that's getting the most light the

745
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:53,200
most energy let's do a few spots on the

746
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:54,720
plant sometimes just like trichomes the

747
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,640
tops of the plant the seeds are ready

748
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,480
and the bottom needs to keep going

749
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,240
sometimes in the greenhouse in the grow

750
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,798
space some of the plant seeds are

751
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,640
already earlier than others the seeds

752
00:25:02,798 --> 00:25:06,400
that come from the platinum tangie are

753
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,480
always done sooner than the seeds that

754
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,320
come from strawberry starburst i always

755
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,319
know that that will be a thing that

756
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:14,079
saves me

757
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:16,158
the headache of having to cut down those

758
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:18,720
two plants at the same time i know that

759
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:20,400
if i run a large crop of platinum tangy

760
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,480
that i can cut that down seven to ten

761
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,400
days earlier than anything made with the

762
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,919
strawberry fields i said strawberry

763
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,440
starburst earlier sorry i may have

764
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:29,038
transposed those but i do mix that up in

765
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,720
my brain a lot but i know that the

766
00:25:29,038 --> 00:25:32,319
timing that i can help myself out by

767
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,919
staggering those because they won't be

768
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:36,558
done for a week apart so i can get the

769
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:38,480
one down dried get it chopped up into

770
00:25:36,558 --> 00:25:40,079
small pieces and then move the other one

771
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,720
in and they can change places they can

772
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:44,720
rotate in my process in my processing so

773
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,000
i don't have to do it all at one time

774
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,240
so pull the seeds out see if they're

775
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,558
ripe that's what i'm getting at there um

776
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,079
you'll start developing the eye and the

777
00:25:50,558 --> 00:25:54,158
feel to know if the seeds are ready if

778
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:55,839
you leave them too long they'll get too

779
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:57,520
hard if you take them too early they

780
00:25:55,839 --> 00:25:59,278
won't be viable

781
00:25:57,519 --> 00:26:01,200
find some some of your seeds are going

782
00:25:59,278 --> 00:26:03,200
to be done earlier than others in one

783
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,038
plant find that law of averages do you

784
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,319
have enough that are done that it's time

785
00:26:05,038 --> 00:26:08,558
to cut down the plant or do you want to

786
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:09,759
wait longer and let some get too hard

787
00:26:08,558 --> 00:26:11,599
that's the timing to be done if you're

788
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:14,000
only making 30 or 40 seeds cut them down

789
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:15,439
around day 70 they should be ready now

790
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,679
let's talk a little bit more

791
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,600
specifically about the timing of using

792
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:20,640
our spray solution

793
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:22,158
i'm going to say it one more time

794
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:25,038
because i may have gone too fast in the

795
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:29,520
last episode i like to spray my pollen

796
00:26:25,038 --> 00:26:32,720
donor 7 to 10 days before i initiate

797
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:34,960
flour i do not initiate flour on my

798
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,400
pollen donor and pollen receiver plants

799
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,880
at the same time that's the next thing

800
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:41,600
we're going to talk about but i start

801
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:44,400
spraying seven to ten days before i flip

802
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:46,158
my pollen donor so a week to ten days

803
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,480
i'll give it a good spray

804
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:51,039
then i will give that plant day one of

805
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:53,120
flower my schedule is set nine to nine

806
00:26:51,038 --> 00:26:56,000
a.m or p.m depends on which room i'm in

807
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:58,719
what i'm doing 9 a.m that light comes on

808
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,400
about 8 45 i go grab the the pollen

809
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,079
donor plants and i spray them for the

810
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:04,880
first time then the light goes off at

811
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:06,720
nine o'clock this is day one of flower

812
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,159
so we get sprayed seven to ten days

813
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,720
before flower

814
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:13,919
then we get sprayed day one a flower now

815
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:16,558
here is the schedule that i follow i

816
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:17,919
spray my silver solution on

817
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:19,278
day one

818
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:20,640
day three

819
00:27:19,278 --> 00:27:21,839
day six

820
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,360
day nine

821
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:24,480
day 12

822
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:25,599
15

823
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,599
18

824
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:30,000
and 21

825
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:32,158
at this point i will start making uh

826
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,278
game time decisions do i need to spray

827
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:38,559
again on 25 do i need to spray again on

828
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:40,079
27 and i have never sprayed after day 30

829
00:27:38,558 --> 00:27:42,079
to be honest with you sometimes the

830
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:44,158
plants are stubborn uh if you've got a

831
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:46,158
stubborn plant you may need to go longer

832
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:48,559
by now we should start seeing pollen so

833
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:51,840
let's talk about that um you the male

834
00:27:48,558 --> 00:27:53,599
will start making pollen around day 30

835
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:56,158
or 35

836
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:58,480
ish this is going to be plant specific

837
00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:01,919
light specific phenotype specific

838
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:06,480
environment specific so i'm saying ish

839
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:08,480
um i'm gonna say day 28 to 37 ish is

840
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:11,200
when you'll get your pollen now the

841
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:14,399
females will be ready for their pollen

842
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:16,399
around day 25 to day 30. so there's a

843
00:28:14,398 --> 00:28:18,879
word problem there's some algebra to be

844
00:28:16,398 --> 00:28:22,719
done there let me tell you again expect

845
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:26,640
pollen between days 30 and 35

846
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:29,200
expect females to be ready around day 25

847
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:31,520
to day 30. now there's more stuff to

848
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,558
talk about don't bump your pollen donor

849
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:34,158
plants

850
00:28:32,558 --> 00:28:36,398
when they're making pollen because that

851
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:38,159
will knock the pollen out early uh they

852
00:28:36,398 --> 00:28:40,798
won't have as much they won't have as

853
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:42,720
much stuff to knock up your females also

854
00:28:40,798 --> 00:28:44,480
that dust may travel to the females and

855
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,079
pollinate them early if they get hit too

856
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,480
early you won't make as many seeds as

857
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:50,960
you could have now one piece of advice

858
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,319
that i use to set my rhythm um i say

859
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:55,120
that the females are going to be ready

860
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:57,038
for pollen around day 25 to 30. the dude

861
00:28:55,119 --> 00:29:00,239
is going to start making pollen around

862
00:28:57,038 --> 00:29:02,720
to 35 the way that i set my rhythm when

863
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:05,440
i see those pollen donor plants showing

864
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:07,759
me that they are truly reversing uh this

865
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:09,440
is a kind of a fail-safe way sometimes

866
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:11,359
your silver solution isn't perfect

867
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:13,440
sometimes your spray intervals delusions

868
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:15,519
ratios timing aren't right for the

869
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:18,720
cultivar you've chosen to reverse so

870
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:20,960
what i do i wait until i see that female

871
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:23,679
plant showing me true signs of

872
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:26,159
successful reversal before i drag my

873
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:28,000
female plants into the flower room this

874
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:30,080
does a couple things

875
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,079
first of all it sets up the timing i

876
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:33,678
know that once i see that part start

877
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:35,759
developing i know i'm just the right

878
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:36,960
time away for that plant to give me

879
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:40,158
pollen to where the girls are going to

880
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:42,640
get timed up just right also this helps

881
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:45,039
me not put female plants into flower

882
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:47,360
when i don't have a pollen donor coming

883
00:29:45,038 --> 00:29:49,359
if i failed if i didn't make my silver

884
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:51,599
solution properly if i didn't reverse at

885
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:53,918
the right time spray correctly if i'd

886
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:56,158
done [ __ ] up i've got a backup plan i

887
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:58,799
still have my females and veg i can get

888
00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:00,799
that pollen donor plant and do other

889
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:02,558
tricks and methods and tactics to try to

890
00:30:00,798 --> 00:30:04,240
reverse it that way i don't just have

891
00:30:02,558 --> 00:30:06,240
plants in there flowering not making

892
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:08,159
seeds scrambling trying to figure [ __ ]

893
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:10,240
out because i've been there won't do it

894
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:12,480
again that sucks i'm better than that at

895
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:14,159
this point and so are you so set

896
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,240
yourself up for success wait until you

897
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:19,440
see that pollen donor plant showing

898
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:22,159
successful signs of reversal then drag

899
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,440
those female plants in there then here

900
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:27,360
comes the next part we're going to

901
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:29,440
harvest our seeds around day 70 or 75

902
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:31,038
maybe day 77

903
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:33,600
i'm going to do a full episode in the

904
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:35,599
future about harvesting seeds this will

905
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:38,398
account for feminized seeds regular

906
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:39,599
seeds autoflower seeds this is universal

907
00:30:38,398 --> 00:30:42,239
however you're going to harvest seeds

908
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:43,839
this will work so uh get those female

909
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:47,200
plants get the male plants the pollen

910
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:49,678
donors about 7 to 15 days ahead expect

911
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:52,000
pollen around day 30 to 35 get the

912
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:53,200
females ready for pollen around day 25

913
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,319
to 30.

914
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,759
pollinate i don't know if you're going

915
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:57,200
to do an open pollination where you're

916
00:30:55,759 --> 00:30:58,798
going to drag that pollen donor in there

917
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,919
and just let it skeet i don't know if

918
00:30:58,798 --> 00:31:02,000
you're going to cut down the top and

919
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:03,120
walk around and beat the females with it

920
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,038
i don't know if you're going to gather

921
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:06,558
pollen and then get the girls going at

922
00:31:05,038 --> 00:31:08,240
another time and sprinkle them i don't

923
00:31:06,558 --> 00:31:09,918
know your tactic but

924
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:12,480
do some pollen chucking get in there get

925
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:15,759
that pollen going on the girls then be

926
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:17,599
patient and wait um

927
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:19,278
let's talk briefly about feeding i don't

928
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:21,359
have any notes about feeding i didn't

929
00:31:19,278 --> 00:31:23,038
write that down we should talk about

930
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:25,199
that the seeded plants are going to want

931
00:31:23,038 --> 00:31:26,319
more nutrients i feed my seeded plants

932
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,798
basically

933
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:31,519
a souped-up veg mix i feed what i'm

934
00:31:28,798 --> 00:31:34,398
feeding my veg plants i do add amino

935
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:36,159
acids i had a liquid amino product from

936
00:31:34,398 --> 00:31:37,918
what's that company called it'll come to

937
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:39,440
me you know who they are all right the

938
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:41,840
company my brain would not bring to my

939
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,679
mind is called microbe life hydroponics

940
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:45,119
they make great stuff they make an amino

941
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:46,960
product that i use i also like that

942
00:31:45,119 --> 00:31:48,879
photosynthesis plus

943
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:51,519
good [ __ ] so i add aminos to my seeded

944
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:53,519
crops i also step up the calmag and a

945
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:55,200
little bit of the nitrogen i don't focus

946
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:57,599
on bud boosters

947
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,759
i will shift later on to the uh the

948
00:31:57,599 --> 00:32:01,359
flowering feed but i don't focus on bud

949
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:03,679
boosters like we do when we're making

950
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:05,678
buds because i'm not making buds i'm

951
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:07,759
making seeds i'm focused on making uh

952
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:09,360
the building blocks for life and i do

953
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:11,919
believe that a little bit of those amino

954
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:14,479
acids a lot of nitrogen basic nutrients

955
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:17,120
will help us out with that um somebody

956
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:19,440
asked what kind of thiosol of the uh i

957
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:21,918
am using the anhydrous version the

958
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:24,000
crystalline anhydrous is what i am using

959
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:26,559
i honestly think that answers all of the

960
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,558
questions that i had written down in a

961
00:32:26,558 --> 00:32:31,200
future episode i am again going to talk

962
00:32:28,558 --> 00:32:32,558
about the harvesting of these seeds so

963
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,880
you've got some time to go let your

964
00:32:32,558 --> 00:32:36,639
seeds grow the next time we check in

965
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:38,960
we'll talk about cutting down your

966
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:40,640
seeded cannabis plants if they're

967
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:43,278
feminized seeds regular seeds

968
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:44,559
autoflowers maybe it's just hemp we'll

969
00:32:43,278 --> 00:32:46,480
teach you how to cut them down get those

970
00:32:44,558 --> 00:32:48,720
seeds out of there that is a tedious

971
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,558
task if you're not prepared properly all

972
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:53,038
