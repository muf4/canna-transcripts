68
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:14,469
flower or are you even into that

69
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:15,969
I have such a hard time I know as soon

70
00:02:14,469 --> 00:02:17,439
as I started asking I was like Clint's

71
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:20,259
not really a descriptive kind of guy

72
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:22,509
like that no I don't taste like an

73
00:02:20,259 --> 00:02:26,500
overall tastes would you say bubblegummy

74
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:28,780
and slightly fruity no I would I need to

75
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:30,520
try it again real quick and I'll let you

76
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:32,439
know give me one moment Jeff as soon as

77
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:34,270
you open the jar with it when you of it

78
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:35,530
when you got here it smelled bubblegummy

79
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:36,969
and kind of fruity and I was like that

80
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:38,680
smells pretty damn good

81
00:02:36,969 --> 00:02:40,479
no when I hit it that bubblegum and

82
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:42,370
fruit flavor came through that means it

83
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:44,289
was dried and cured properly I like it

84
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:45,939
well it's a good flower whoever grew

85
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:48,939

86
00:02:45,939 --> 00:02:51,490
yeah I I did the drying and curing on

87
00:02:48,939 --> 00:02:53,560

88
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:55,030
friend's plan cool well that friend

89
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,400
until they broke the branch they did a

90
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:59,349
pretty good job well you know that it

91
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,640
happens when you get some heavy buds

92
00:02:59,349 --> 00:03:03,639

107

[ __ ] lemony dude yeah I was tipping

108
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,460
the package over I like to take photos

109
00:03:40,509 --> 00:03:44,919
of my concentrates and then I share them

110
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:46,840
to my social media feed I only put them

111
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:49,059
on my story I don't put them in my

112
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,289
Instagram post because Instagram can be

113
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,490
haters when I post photos of

114
00:03:50,289 --> 00:03:53,139
concentrates and they'll take the

115
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:55,360
picture down really so I put it up in

116
00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:57,099
the story and it stays for 24 hours and

117
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,810
it disappears and then my good friends

118
00:03:57,099 --> 00:04:00,879
at Green Dot labs they repost it so it

119
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:02,710
gets to be seen by a few more folks but

120
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,689
I do post the photos as I was thinking a

121
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:07,120
photo of this I noticed there are so

122
00:04:04,689 --> 00:04:09,250
many Terps in this jar this is a four

123
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,620
gram jar I think it's two and a half

124
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:14,199
grams of Terps minus the quarter grandma

125
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:16,090
Terps that poured out onto my finger I

126
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:17,680
didn't realize it was coming out so just

127
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:19,629
a little bit of Terp sauce on my finger

128
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,430
it looks like ah a little maple syrup

129
00:04:19,629 --> 00:04:23,050
little pancakes or not the color but the

130
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:25,000
consistency of like maybe some honey or

131
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:26,060
some maple syrup on my finger thick and

132
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,918
I didn't know what to do with it

133
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:29,360
think I panicked I was gonna take a

134
00:04:27,918 --> 00:04:30,918
picture because it was really pretty I

135
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,050
was like oh that's really pretty just

136
00:04:30,918 --> 00:04:34,609
tripping off my finger it was gonna drip

137
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:36,470
onto the table and or the floor and I

138
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:40,370
didn't want that to happen so I licked

139
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:42,800
it off my finger I'm not sure if that

140
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:44,629
was a good or bad idea you did say that

141
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,669
was the first time you've ever done I

142
00:04:44,629 --> 00:04:48,259
think to the best of my memory that's

143
00:04:46,668 --> 00:04:50,629
the first time I may have had some lemon

144
00:04:48,259 --> 00:04:53,240
Jeffery Terps and a smaller dose in that

145
00:04:50,629 --> 00:04:56,209
manner but that was a nice little boy

146
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:58,250
fool and my tongue had a weird sensation

147
00:04:56,209 --> 00:05:00,199
for a few minutes it felt like my tongue

148
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:04,310
was kind of tingly and kind of vibrating

149
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:07,909
then it tasted like lemons and lemons

150
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:08,540
and more lemons also tasted like the

151
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:11,060
forest

152
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:12,919
it was very pine tree in my mouth very

153
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:14,780
uh it was like if you took me there's a

154
00:05:12,918 --> 00:05:15,829
National Forest 40 minutes south of here

155
00:05:14,779 --> 00:05:17,869
if you took me there and you're like

156
00:05:15,829 --> 00:05:20,209
breathe in that's what my mouth tasted

157
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:22,250
like just foresty it was delicious but

158
00:05:20,209 --> 00:05:25,009
that was a very unique thing I'm not

159
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:26,540
sure because I did take two fat dabs of

160
00:05:25,009 --> 00:05:29,360
the sour best lemons and a couple of

161
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:31,220
puffs off that bowl I'm high and I don't

162
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,569
know if I got extra high from the part

163
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:37,760

296
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:53,490
of the so I wasn't gonna talk about my

297
00:10:52,409 --> 00:10:55,949
uncle for too long but this is where

298
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:57,419
this goes when I was younger my uncle's

299
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:59,850
had a lot to do with my life they were

300
00:10:57,419 --> 00:11:01,019
rowdy bunch they were like me now you

301
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:02,759
know what I mean that's just what I

302
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:04,169
learned it is from them cuz they're

303
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:05,610
always the stoners in the back room

304
00:11:04,169 --> 00:11:07,319
smoking a joint so

305
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:08,789
one day we're driving to a concert they

306
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,890
took me to my first real concert they're

307
00:11:08,789 --> 00:11:11,969
playing Metallica in the [ __ ] car and

308
00:11:10,889 --> 00:11:13,679
they don't realize that I've been around

309
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:14,940
some stoners already but they're smoking

310
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:17,129
a joint up front they don't realize how

311
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:19,529
stoned I got in the back of that [ __ ]

312
00:11:17,129 --> 00:11:22,078
[ __ ] yeah it was baked and we were to

313
00:11:19,528 --> 00:11:24,149
the concert had the best time and I

314
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:25,620
think they might have realized I was

315
00:11:24,149 --> 00:11:27,240
stoned and because after that they

316
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:30,450
started offering to smoke with me and

317
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:33,149
and they played Metallica the Black

318
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:36,450
Album on that ride and that's part of

319
00:11:33,149 --> 00:11:37,919
why I became a drummer we'll move

320
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:39,509

the final episode it is the last episode

351
00:12:53,669 --> 00:12:59,000
of 2020 no 2019 I wrote 2020 on the

352
00:12:58,198 --> 00:13:01,649
paper

353
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,620

354
00:13:01,649 --> 00:13:08,519
last episode of 2019 yeah the last

355
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:11,278
episode of 2019 episode 500 is coming up

356
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:13,259
that's what yeah so I've got two things

357
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:16,350
- to branch off of that since this is

358
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:18,480
the last episode of the year and we've

359
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:19,200
got 2020 coming up sorry I said the

360
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,340
wrong you

361
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,810
I might have thought some people are

362
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:23,759
looking at their calendars and freaking

363
00:13:21,809 --> 00:13:26,429
the [ __ ] out right now well they should

364
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:29,549
because we just dog time trap we're back

365
00:13:26,429 --> 00:13:31,169
back to the future um set some goals

366
00:13:29,549 --> 00:13:34,199
that's what I think you should do set

367
00:13:31,169 --> 00:13:34,949
some goals for 2020 if it's I mean this

368
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,690
is a grow show

369
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:38,700
I encourage you to do something better

370
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:40,500
in your garden what do you suck at G are

371
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:42,030
you not good at cloning are you not good

372
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,350
at trimming do you not know how to tell

373
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:45,299
when to harvest are you really bad at

374
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:46,830
telling when you've got bugs get better

375
00:13:45,299 --> 00:13:49,319
at that find something find your

376
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:50,970
weakness find your weak link and improve

377
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:53,580
upon that find your skill which you lack

378
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:55,710
in in the garden and brush up on it you

379
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:57,629
can get good at it there are books their

380
00:13:55,710 --> 00:14:00,360
websites their podcast episodes their

381
00:13:57,629 --> 00:14:02,279
standard operating procedures written on

382
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:05,490
just about every step of the growth you

383
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:07,559
can improve and make your weak link your

384
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:09,960
strongest link and improve your entire

385
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:11,909
grow so set some goals that would be my

386
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:13,530
recommendation for the garden find what

387
00:14:11,909 --> 00:14:15,870
you're sucking at and do better at it

388
00:14:13,529 --> 00:14:17,819
get out of your comfort zone like if

389
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:19,470
you're really good at throwing sidekicks

390
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:21,480
but you're no good at sweeps just work

391
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:22,980
on sweeps until you're good at it get

392
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,080
better at everything in life by working

393
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:26,310
at something you suck at if you go play

394
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:28,170
the video game that you're really good

395
00:14:26,309 --> 00:14:29,759
at and play the level you're really good

396
00:14:28,169 --> 00:14:31,469
at smoke everybody all day you're just

397
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:32,909
beating your [ __ ] ego yeah if you go

398
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:34,680
play the level that's hard and you play

399
00:14:32,909 --> 00:14:36,209
against harder people you're feeding

400
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:39,269
your soul so go feed your soul a little

401
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:40,590
bit yeah there he goes it's so hard dude

402
00:14:39,269 --> 00:14:42,000
clay and I have been having some

403
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:43,830
conversations some existential

404
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,480
conversations about life here we're both

405
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:46,379
that we're pretty good friends yeah

406
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,149
we're good friends and we're both

407
00:14:46,379 --> 00:14:50,039
approaching a different generate or a

408
00:14:48,149 --> 00:14:52,110
different age of life you know we're

409
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:53,189
both I'm [ __ ] 40 bro people probably

410
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:54,419
don't know that when they see me and

411
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:56,100
listen to the show they a lot of people

412
00:14:54,419 --> 00:14:57,449
think I'm younger right behind you yeah

413
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:59,310
I'm a 40 year old man so I've got a lot

414
00:14:57,450 --> 00:15:00,750
of different insight lately people have

415
00:14:59,309 --> 00:15:02,369
passed away in my life and things have

416
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:04,259
changed so definitely one of those

417
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:06,240
introspective type of months when I've

418
00:15:04,259 --> 00:15:07,559
had some great conversations I'm gonna

419
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,539
get myself back on track you're really a

420
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:11,189
[ __ ] stone normally set some goals

421
00:15:09,539 --> 00:15:13,469
you guys set some goals in the garden

422
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:15,330
you're only as good as your weakest part

423
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:17,250
so get good at everything get good at

424
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:19,379
that [ __ ] work on some soil building

425
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:21,360
skills then also where do you suck at in

426
00:15:19,379 --> 00:15:23,279
life like what are you [ __ ] up do

427
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:26,460
that better next year but just be honest

428
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:28,019
with yourself first he finds out what JT

429
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:29,790
that's what you suck at is being honest

430
00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:32,370
with yourself dude I think that's that's

431
00:15:29,789 --> 00:15:34,469
ego man you know I just if

432
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:36,600
if there's okay so I guess I'm answering

433
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:38,040
mine it's like work on ego there we go

434
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:40,889
we know what Kalia needs to work on I

435
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:44,219
just always I always have I think I take

436
00:15:40,889 --> 00:15:46,860
on too many things I try to satisfy the

437
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:49,889
demands of too many different sources

438
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:51,360
and I don't mind trying to do it but

439
00:15:49,889 --> 00:15:53,220
sometimes I dig myself a hole because I

440
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,839
make too many commitments that I mean

441
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:57,290
while trying to do so many things but I

442
00:15:54,839 --> 00:16:00,480
can only do so many so I end up doing

443
00:15:57,289 --> 00:16:01,889
ten things 90% as well as I could have

444
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,050
if I would have only chosen to do eight

445
00:16:01,889 --> 00:16:05,250
things a hundred percent that's one of

446
00:16:04,049 --> 00:16:07,799
my downfalls it's something I should

447
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:08,909
work on but set some goals guys so you

448
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:10,289
know we've got some goals we could work

449
00:16:08,909 --> 00:16:12,209
on it doesn't have to be like I want to

450
00:16:10,289 --> 00:16:13,559
make a thousand dollars doing this or I

451
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:13,950
want to buy a new car if that's what you

452
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:15,569
want

453
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:16,830
that could be your goal but it could be

454
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:18,990
something really little it can be

455
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:21,270
something really large if you struggle

456
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:23,580
just sticking to a commitment maybe

457
00:16:21,269 --> 00:16:25,470
that's your new New Year's goal anyone

458
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:27,240
have to set a goal on it on the new you

459
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:28,500
could start today sorry right now but

460
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,899
set some goals for your life set some

461
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:32,639
goals for yourself and then write them

462
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:34,500
down because if you don't write it down

463
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:35,610
it's just an imagination it's just a

464
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,950
thought you got to put it on some paper

465
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:39,629
and then put that paper where you're

466
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:41,400
going to look at it put it next to your

467
00:16:39,629 --> 00:16:43,710
money put it on the fridge put it next

468

469
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:46,560
words I don't if you're one of those if

470

on that post two months ago I don't even

520
00:18:22,829 --> 00:18:26,189
remember exactly I think it may be

521
00:18:24,329 --> 00:18:27,808
better that Instagram has taken off the

522
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:29,338
amount of likes it doesn't show you how

523
00:18:27,808 --> 00:18:30,898
many likes you get on your post and I

524
00:18:29,338 --> 00:18:33,210
think it may be healthier for people I

525
00:18:30,898 --> 00:18:37,408
hope so yeah there's a disease going

526
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:40,919
through just humans right now with the

527
00:18:37,409 --> 00:18:43,049
way we're using phones I'm sorry derail

528
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:44,729
at the stamp screens bro no screens we

529
00:18:43,048 --> 00:18:47,460
went to a comedy show and we went to a

530
00:18:44,729 --> 00:18:49,379

533
00:18:51,148 --> 00:18:55,768
is hidden inside the Denver Convention

534
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:58,829
Center inside the Denver Convention

535
00:18:55,769 --> 00:19:03,210
Center is basically a six foot by nine

536
00:18:58,829 --> 00:19:05,069
foot iPad and it's interactive and Clint

537
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:07,858

538
00:19:05,069 --> 00:19:09,960
both mesmerised by this big screen they

539
00:19:07,858 --> 00:19:12,148
didn't tear anything really except you

540

542
00:19:14,098 --> 00:19:18,898
here to here there was lead you how to

543
00:19:15,868 --> 00:19:20,548
get there yeah we're [ __ ] smart

544
00:19:18,898 --> 00:19:22,319
people we could [ __ ] walk from point

545
00:19:20,548 --> 00:19:24,088
A to point B pretty well that's pretty

546
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:25,648
neat seeing the future stuff though we

547
00:19:24,088 --> 00:19:27,269
did we were just mesmerized by that

548
00:19:25,648 --> 00:19:29,488
thing there was a list of things you

549
00:19:27,269 --> 00:19:31,200
cannot take in to the comedy show we

550
00:19:29,489 --> 00:19:33,960
read the whole list just because it was

551
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,609
on some interactive screen don't give a

552
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:37,229
[ __ ] we couldn't we didn't have any of

553
00:19:35,608 --> 00:19:43,558
those things you don't care there's no

554
00:19:37,229 --> 00:19:45,419
chance we had any of that pretty stone -

555
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:47,098
so oh yeah we're going to see Tommy

556
00:19:45,419 --> 00:19:50,690
Bonds or Joe Rogan so we were definitely

557
00:19:47,098 --> 00:19:53,308
heavily medicated - at that time yeah

558
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:55,470
because we were pretty wiped out when we

559
00:19:53,308 --> 00:19:59,670
were going to see Tommy Bonds

560
00:19:55,470 --> 00:20:01,470
yeah have you seen the guy with pot

561
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:03,269
tattooed across his forehead I think

562
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:05,250
that guy looks a lot like Jeff Tate

563
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:06,930
there's a guy you'll see him on social

564
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:10,849
media he's got the word pothead wine

565
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:13,259
he's got joints for eyebrows oh yeah

566
00:20:10,849 --> 00:20:14,369
well since I gonna say right set some

567
00:20:13,259 --> 00:20:16,470
goals you guys it doesn't have to be in

568
00:20:14,369 --> 00:20:17,699
the grow just set some goals and you

569
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:19,710
don't have to beat yourself up over it

570
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:22,049
doesn't have to be anything amazing I do

571
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:24,480

573
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,470
improve in some way shape or form and be

574
00:20:26,549 --> 00:20:30,389
honest with yourself about it and then

575
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:32,250
also remember that social media is just

576
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:34,530
a game and you don't have to win nobody

577
