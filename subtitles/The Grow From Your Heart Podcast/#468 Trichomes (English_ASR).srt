just so I can give you an accurate

11
00:00:51,689 --> 00:00:56,939
updated description yeah it has

12
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:59,128
definitely got the watermelon strawberry

13
00:00:56,939 --> 00:01:01,229
notes to begin with it ends with the

14
00:00:59,128 --> 00:01:02,909
hops then the grapefruit rind kind of

15
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:04,978
takes over at the end there and then

16
00:01:02,909 --> 00:01:07,109
there is a lingering hint of fuel at the

17
00:01:04,978 --> 00:01:08,849
end but honestly I would have put

18
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:10,950
watermelon and strawberry in the

19
00:01:08,849 --> 00:01:12,809
description it does pack a nice punch

20
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:16,170
the potency label says that this product

21
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:18,780
contains 68 point zero nine percent THC

22
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:20,189
non detectable amounts of CBD it does

23
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:22,290
pack a nice punch it gives me a nice

24
00:01:20,188 --> 00:01:25,169
buzz but the part that really stands out

25
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:27,118
is that delicious sweet strawberry candy

26
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:29,100

00:03:38,669 --> 00:03:40,888
that means a lot

79
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:42,780
it says I'm listening to the episode

80
00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:45,870
from Friday and the vapin through

81
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:46,979
security topic gave me a good laugh so

82
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:49,379
if you've been listening to the podcast

83
00:03:46,979 --> 00:03:51,419
you've heard me talk about taking my

84
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:53,340
bait pins through security getting them

85
00:03:51,419 --> 00:03:55,738
into some concerts having a good time

86
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:56,670
with my Green Dot labs full-spectrum

87
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:58,799
extract

88
00:03:56,669 --> 00:04:01,078
bait pens here I was able to heavily

89
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,540
medicated some Phish concerts I was able

90
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:05,549
to well medicate at a Tom Segura comedy

91
00:04:03,539 --> 00:04:07,949
show recently but without those bait

92
00:04:05,549 --> 00:04:09,480
pens I would have been uh not very well

93
00:04:07,949 --> 00:04:11,969
medicated so let's continue with this

94
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:14,399
message because it says I am in New York

95
00:04:11,969 --> 00:04:16,348
I went to my local courthouse to pick up

96
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,209
my pistol permit and had to go through a

97
00:04:16,348 --> 00:04:20,159
metal detector yes when you go into most

98
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:22,500
courthouses you are forced to walk

99
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,479
through the metal detectors this person

100
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:27,000
says I emptied my pockets and completely

101
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:27,990
forgot I had my cartridge pen in my

102
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,720
pocket

103
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:32,759
while on vacation in Portland so this

104
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,530
person walked into the court they

105
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:36,060
thought sure I'll throw my car keys and

106
00:04:34,529 --> 00:04:37,529
my cellphone or whatever else in the

107
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:39,629
little basket here and I'll walk right

108
00:04:37,529 --> 00:04:42,239
through the metal detector and this dude

109
00:04:39,629 --> 00:04:43,740
realizes I have got my cartridge he

110
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,228
picked up a cart when he was in Portland

111
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:47,939
probably came back all the travel woes

112
00:04:46,228 --> 00:04:50,098
took over completely forgot that

113
00:04:47,939 --> 00:04:52,829
cartridge was there this dude pulls it

114
00:04:50,098 --> 00:04:55,529
out in the courthouse he says nearly

115
00:04:52,829 --> 00:04:58,050
[ __ ] myself as the cop took the bin and

116
00:04:55,529 --> 00:04:59,399
I walked through the metal detector yeah

117
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:02,038
I could imagine that feeling being in

118
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:04,560
New York it is much more secure than a

119
00:05:02,038 --> 00:05:06,899
lot of other places I am certain of it

120
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,009
is not cannabis friendly so here in

121
00:05:06,899 --> 00:05:09,448
Colorado if they catch you with your

122
00:05:08,009 --> 00:05:11,310
pants I go what can take that back to

123
00:05:09,449 --> 00:05:12,509
the car you can't bring that in here I'm

124
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:13,769
sure if they catch you with that in New

125
00:05:12,509 --> 00:05:15,449
York they go oh you're already in the

126
00:05:13,769 --> 00:05:17,788
court let's just put you in a cage and

127
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:20,639
they just skip a bunch of steps anyway

128
00:05:17,788 --> 00:05:23,579
this person says not a word was said and

129
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:25,620
I was on my way so this person got lucky

130
00:05:23,579 --> 00:05:27,449
luckily that law enforcement officer

131
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:28,949
that had to inspect the handful of crap

132
00:05:27,449 --> 00:05:30,960
that they pass through they just thought

133
00:05:28,949 --> 00:05:32,550
that's probably just a nicotine pen and

134
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:34,198
they didn't give a [ __ ] part of the

135
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:35,430
thing was that you just slid it right

136
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:36,960
through and didn't act like it was

137
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:38,968
anything so they didn't think it was

138
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:40,589
anything you wouldn't hand them drugs he

139
00:05:38,968 --> 00:05:42,120
wouldn't be like here's my drugs so they

140
00:05:40,589 --> 00:05:43,948
thought these aren't drugs they said

141
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,829
yeah it's probably your nicotine pen and

142
00:05:43,949 --> 00:05:48,120
they just let it slide right through so

143
00:05:45,829 --> 00:05:49,800
congratulations I'm really happy that

144
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:52,620
you did not get yourself in trouble

145
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:54,538
be more careful bro anybody out there if

146
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:56,069
you were going to any sort of

147
00:05:54,538 --> 00:05:58,168
environment where you feel like you may

148
00:05:56,069 --> 00:05:59,699
need to empty your pockets do a double

149
00:05:58,168 --> 00:06:01,408
check make sure you don't have anything

150
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:03,150
illegal in your pocket so you don't get

151
00:06:01,408 --> 00:06:04,800
yourself in trouble there's a really

152
00:06:03,149 --> 00:06:06,629
funny meme that goes around on social

153
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,259
media it shows that a waitress in

154
00:06:06,629 --> 00:06:09,509
Colorado

155
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:11,460
went to leave her pen along with the

156
00:06:09,509 --> 00:06:12,658
check at the restaurant so the diner

157
00:06:11,459 --> 00:06:15,899
could sign their check but they

158
00:06:12,658 --> 00:06:17,519
accidentally left their dad pen now if

159
00:06:15,899 --> 00:06:18,750
that were the wrong environment that

160
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:21,029
person could have gotten in a lot of

161
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:23,370
trouble fortunately it is a Colorado

162
00:06:21,029 --> 00:06:24,989
restaurant everybody probably laughed

163
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:27,209
pretty hard at that but we've got to be

164
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:29,939
more careful I do catch myself getting

165
00:06:27,209 --> 00:06:31,680
too relaxed too comfortable I want to go

166
00:06:29,939 --> 00:06:33,870
to other places I do travel out-of-state

167
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,310
a little bit and I catch myself just

168
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:37,110
smoking places that I shouldn't be

169
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:38,728
smoking and I have to say oh yeah you're

170
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:41,500
not in Colorado you gotta chill the [ __ ]

171
00:06:38,728 --> 00:06:44,349
out also I was talking about hitting my

172
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:46,269
pin at a Tom Segura comedy show I would

173
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:48,280
never smoke and comedy works that was at

174
00:06:46,269 --> 00:06:50,349
a different venue a much larger venue

175
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:52,389
and I caught myself I had my pen in my

176
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:53,800
hand just cuz I have it and I click the

177
00:06:52,389 --> 00:06:55,839
button a couple times and I put it my

178
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:58,240
mouth and I just ripped it and as I had

179
00:06:55,839 --> 00:07:00,669
a lung full of dab smoke I realized

180
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,740
you've got a lung full of dab smoke in a

181
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:04,750
comedy club you should not be doing this

182
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:06,310
I was like now what am I gonna do I got

183
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:07,899
a bunch of smoke in my lungs had to hold

184
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:09,970
that [ __ ] in until I almost died you

185
00:07:07,899 --> 00:07:11,859
guys so I did catch myself getting a

186
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:13,630
little too comfortable a little too at

187
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:15,100
home just pulled out my pen and ripped

188
00:07:13,629 --> 00:07:16,540
it right there in the Belko theater like

189
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:18,370
I was supposed to be smoking it there

190
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:19,660
you're not supposed to be smoking it

191
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:21,699
there they would have kicked me out if

192
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:22,960
somebody had spotted me so we need to

193
00:07:21,699 --> 00:07:24,699
learn to be a little more careful if

194
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:26,379
you're in a legal state still be a

195
00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:28,810
little bit paranoid if you were in an

196
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:29,909
illegal state please be extra paranoid

197
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:32,139
let's not get ourselves in trouble

198
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:34,090
luckily our friend walked through and

199
00:07:32,139 --> 00:07:36,519
not a word was said because he acted

200
00:07:34,089 --> 00:07:38,168
like nothing was wrong anyway there is

201
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:40,240
one more sentence left in this message

202
00:07:38,168 --> 00:07:42,729
it says anyway thanks for spreading the

203
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,829
knowledge and keep up the amazing work

204
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:46,330
hey our friend King of Prussia I want to

205
00:07:44,829 --> 00:07:47,939
call you Wilson if you get that joke

206
00:07:46,329 --> 00:07:50,228
you're a lot cooler than some people

207
00:07:47,939 --> 00:07:52,329
Wilson thank you for the great email I

208
00:07:50,228 --> 00:07:54,849
do appreciate it I'm glad you did not

209
00:07:52,329 --> 00:07:56,379
get in any trouble if anybody else out

210
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:59,020
there wants to send me an email my email

211
00:07:56,379 --> 00:08:01,120
address is grow from your heart at

212
00:07:59,019 --> 00:08:02,978
hotmail.com I would love to hear from

213
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,750
you all right let's just keep the show

214
00:08:02,978 --> 00:08:08,110
moving right into the next email this

215
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:11,079
one goes like this jefe Jeff I've got

216
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:13,270
four outdoor container-grown sunkissed

217
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:16,209
plants where the top surface trichomes

218
00:08:13,269 --> 00:08:19,478
are about 20% amber so this person has

219
00:08:16,209 --> 00:08:22,719
four sunkissed plants outdoors in

220
00:08:19,478 --> 00:08:25,180
containers and the top surface trichomes

221
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,520
are 20% amber that is a great place to

222
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:29,650
start that is good information Sun

223
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:31,810
kisses across that I bread that is of

224
00:08:29,649 --> 00:08:33,699
course the Platinum tangi from our

225
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:36,070
friends at the garden of Weeden cross to

226
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:38,169
Maya rise wonderful strain to work with

227
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:39,820
a great outdoor strain we should have

228
00:08:38,168 --> 00:08:41,829
good success let's continue it says

229
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:43,089
normally I would think these plants

230
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:45,070
would be ready for harvest

231
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:47,350
but looking at the undersides of the

232
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:49,870
leaves through a high-quality botanical

233
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:52,240
microscope showing trichomes are still

234
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:54,159
clear and cloudy with a little bit of

235
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,528
amber coloration

236
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:59,078
so this person has acquired a scope they

237
00:08:56,528 --> 00:09:00,549
probably magnified similar to sixty to a

238
00:08:59,078 --> 00:09:02,769
hundred acts and they're looking at the

239
00:09:00,549 --> 00:09:04,719
undersides of the leaves through their

240
00:09:02,769 --> 00:09:06,899
microscope and the trichomes are still

241
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,339
clear on the undersides of the leaves

242
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:11,589
more of the message says I'm a beginner

243
00:09:09,339 --> 00:09:13,300
grower this is my third grow and I

244
00:09:11,589 --> 00:09:15,250
previously would have cut these plants

245
00:09:13,299 --> 00:09:17,979
at this point but given that they're at

246
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:20,289
day 48 of flower and the suggested

247
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:23,589
harvest age from Ira genetics Colorado

248
00:09:20,289 --> 00:09:26,379
comm is 56 days I'm wondering if I

249
00:09:23,589 --> 00:09:29,439
should wait another week these plants

250
00:09:26,379 --> 00:09:31,930
have had a lot of TLC and full sunlight

251
00:09:29,438 --> 00:09:34,419
all summer long maybe they're just ready

252
00:09:31,929 --> 00:09:37,028
to go and he ends it with appreciate any

253
00:09:34,419 --> 00:09:38,889
feedback you can provide thank you from

254
00:09:37,028 --> 00:09:41,438
our friend we're just gonna call him

255
00:09:38,889 --> 00:09:43,089
caffeine is what he signed it as here so

256
00:09:41,438 --> 00:09:45,129
let's talk about a couple of things that

257
00:09:43,089 --> 00:09:46,930
our buddy caffeine had to say and just

258
00:09:45,129 --> 00:09:48,909
to make you feel better I do intend on

259
00:09:46,929 --> 00:09:50,859
doing a full episode on the strain

260
00:09:48,909 --> 00:09:53,019
Sunkiss I think that's about four or

261
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:55,028
five episodes out it is in the notebook

262
00:09:53,019 --> 00:09:57,610
it is mostly written so we will get a

263
00:09:55,028 --> 00:09:59,708
full episode on that strain but for now

264
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:03,339
let's focus on some of the questions in

265
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:06,219
this email you start off right on track

266
00:10:03,339 --> 00:10:07,720
with trichomes or 20% amber and normally

267
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:10,149
I would think these plants are ready for

268
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:12,879
harvest if you've got 20% amber

269
00:10:10,149 --> 00:10:14,559
trichomes you are absolutely ready for

270
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:16,629
harvest I almost would have taken that

271
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:18,008
plant down sooner but you're still going

272
00:10:16,629 --> 00:10:19,389
to be alright we have a nice harvest

273
00:10:18,009 --> 00:10:21,879
window here we'll talk a little bit

274
00:10:19,389 --> 00:10:23,500
about that in a moment I would take

275
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:25,028
those down they are probably done you're

276
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,259
saying but looking at the underside of

277
00:10:25,028 --> 00:10:30,639
the leaves through a high-quality

278
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:32,980
microscope shows clear with little amber

279
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:34,959
coloration in the trichomes now the

280
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:36,789
undersides of the leaves don't really

281
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:38,799
matter what we are going for is ripe

282
00:10:36,789 --> 00:10:40,599
trichomes on the buds how many of those

283
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:42,308
leaves are you going to smoke hopefully

284
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,899
not too many hopefully you're going to

285
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:45,549
turn that into concentrates or something

286
00:10:43,899 --> 00:10:47,980
hopefully you're not smoking the leaves

287
00:10:45,549 --> 00:10:50,169
we want to focus mostly on the buds I

288
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:52,028
would look at a bud up at top I would

289
00:10:50,169 --> 00:10:53,438
look at a bud halfway down the plant and

290
00:10:52,028 --> 00:10:55,389
then I would look at a lower bud and I

291
00:10:53,438 --> 00:10:57,549
would do a few checks with my microscope

292
00:10:55,389 --> 00:10:59,438
and I would see what percentage of the

293
00:10:57,549 --> 00:11:00,758
trichomes are amber in each section of

294
00:10:59,438 --> 00:11:02,708
the plant and then I would use my best

295
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:04,659
judgment to harvest based on the overall

296
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:06,068
appearance of the trichomes the

297
00:11:04,659 --> 00:11:08,049
trichomes you're finding on the

298
00:11:06,068 --> 00:11:09,909
undersides of the leaves would

299
00:11:08,049 --> 00:11:11,649
very little to do with my

300
00:11:09,909 --> 00:11:13,659
decision-making when thinking about

301
00:11:11,649 --> 00:11:16,328
harvest times that would not matter to

302
00:11:13,659 --> 00:11:18,308
me at all I want to look at the buds so

303
00:11:16,328 --> 00:11:20,558
it sounds like you've got 20% amber

304
00:11:18,308 --> 00:11:22,719
trichomes on your buds your plants are

305
00:11:20,558 --> 00:11:24,850
probably ready for harvest now you did

306
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,739
bring up a very good topic in here it

307
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:29,649
says I previously would have cut these

308
00:11:26,739 --> 00:11:31,449
but they're at day 48 and on the website

309
00:11:29,649 --> 00:11:34,600
from the breeder which is myself

310
00:11:31,448 --> 00:11:36,818
we recommend 56 days so you're wondering

311
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,290
if you should wait if the plants are

312
00:11:36,818 --> 00:11:40,118
showing you that they're done they are

313
00:11:38,289 --> 00:11:41,860
done don't worry about what the website

314
00:11:40,119 --> 00:11:43,329
says don't worry about what I told you

315
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:45,459
don't worry about what I said in a live

316
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:47,229
feed don't worry about what anybody on

317
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:49,568
social media tells you if the trichomes

318
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:52,089
are amber the plant is done that is what

319
00:11:49,568 --> 00:11:54,308
we use to gauge the ripeness of a plant

320
00:11:52,089 --> 00:11:56,499
is amber trichomes that is our goal is a

321
00:11:54,308 --> 00:11:58,360
right track

322
00:11:56,499 --> 00:12:00,909
the plant is ripe nobody on Facebook

323
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:03,129
knows if that trichome is ripe nobody on

324
00:12:00,909 --> 00:12:05,980
any social media knows I don't even know

325
00:12:03,129 --> 00:12:08,589
if it's ripe there are variations in

326
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:11,558
plants that come from seed ideally most

327
00:12:08,589 --> 00:12:14,829
phenotypes of that plant overall will

328
00:12:11,558 --> 00:12:16,568
end around the 56 day mark you've got an

329
00:12:14,828 --> 00:12:18,519
anomaly you may have gotten a little

330
00:12:16,568 --> 00:12:20,409
extra sunshine you maybe you've gotten a

331
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:22,028
little less sunshine and some grows

332
00:12:20,409 --> 00:12:23,528
maybe you've fed it something different

333
00:12:22,028 --> 00:12:25,389
maybe you've fed it more maybe you've

334
00:12:23,528 --> 00:12:27,548
had it less maybe it is just a

335
00:12:25,389 --> 00:12:29,589
phenotypic expression maybe you got one

336
00:12:27,548 --> 00:12:30,938
that finishes around what are you at

337
00:12:29,589 --> 00:12:33,040
forty eight maybe you got one they've

338
00:12:30,938 --> 00:12:35,198
finished a week early that is a really

339
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:37,808
good thing and it is very possible

340
00:12:35,198 --> 00:12:39,778
because the Sunkiss strain does have

341
00:12:37,808 --> 00:12:42,129
phenotypes that end a little bit earlier

342
00:12:39,778 --> 00:12:44,169
but if I would have written on that

343
00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:46,990
package or on my website that those

344
00:12:44,169 --> 00:12:49,298
plants end at 48 days if those plants

345
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:50,259
took 52 days the world would have been

346
00:12:49,298 --> 00:12:52,600
pissed off at me

347
00:12:50,259 --> 00:12:54,339
so saying that they end at 56 days and

348
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:56,439
you've got one that went a week early

349
00:12:54,339 --> 00:12:58,540
that is kind of a good thing it still

350
00:12:56,438 --> 00:13:00,219
sucks because I gave you poor timing but

351
00:12:58,539 --> 00:13:02,469
that is an anomaly that is a phenotypic

352
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:03,999
'el variance something that is kind of

353
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:05,199
expected when it comes to growing so we

354
00:13:03,999 --> 00:13:08,739
have to pay attention to that and

355
00:13:05,198 --> 00:13:11,198
honestly I listed 56 days because that

356
00:13:08,739 --> 00:13:12,819
is my experience indoors you've grown

357
00:13:11,198 --> 00:13:14,349
this outdoors so you're finding

358
00:13:12,818 --> 00:13:16,899
different results because you've got

359
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:18,579
different conditions so that is to be

360
00:13:16,899 --> 00:13:20,769
expected let's talk about that briefly

361
00:13:18,578 --> 00:13:21,689
when we were talking about the time that

362
00:13:20,769 --> 00:13:24,659
it should take two

363
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:26,790
our on a pack of seeds that is a guess

364
00:13:24,659 --> 00:13:28,740
that is an estimate depending on the

365
00:13:26,789 --> 00:13:31,349
breeder of those plants that estimate is

366
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:33,720
based on different things unfortunately

367
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:35,790
we can type whatever we want on our

368
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:37,590
websites we can type whatever we want on

369
00:13:35,789 --> 00:13:39,149
our packaging and there are very few

370
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:41,910
people that will hold us accountable to

371
00:13:39,149 --> 00:13:44,399
that until growers start buying the

372
00:13:41,909 --> 00:13:46,169
seeds and discovering that we told a lie

373
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,549
that is the only thing holding us

374
00:13:46,169 --> 00:13:48,659
accountable but by then you've bought

375
00:13:47,549 --> 00:13:50,159
the seeds and you've grown them

376
00:13:48,659 --> 00:13:52,559
somebody's got your money and they're on

377
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:55,469
vacation already the proper way to do it

378
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:57,839
is to create the seeds then grow them

379
00:13:55,470 --> 00:14:00,509
and take a lot of notes and that is how

380
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:02,610
I determine how long I suggest those

381
00:14:00,509 --> 00:14:04,529
seeds are grown is by growing out large

382
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:06,480
populations I like to grow at least a

383
00:14:04,529 --> 00:14:08,579
hundred seeds before anybody else gets

384
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,289
to see them so I know what to look for

385
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:12,240
when you grow a hundred it is really

386
00:14:10,289 --> 00:14:14,939
easy to create percentages if one

387
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,889
doesn't it's 1% if 50 plants do it that

388
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:19,140
is 50% it's really easy to identify

389
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:22,529
traits and keep statistics with

390
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:24,899
populations of 100 so I grew out 100 of

391
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:27,179
those and the average of those plants

392
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:29,909
were done at day 56 we may have had

393
00:14:27,179 --> 00:14:31,559
outliers go a week each direction I may

394
00:14:29,909 --> 00:14:33,929
have had outliers go two weeks either

395
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:36,689
direction but what I determined overall

396
00:14:33,929 --> 00:14:38,969
was that 56 days would be the average

397
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:41,100
completion time for that strain Sunkiss

398
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:43,139
where most people would have the best

399
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:44,759
success now we do have to keep in mind

400
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:47,069
that these are plants there is going to

401
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:48,840
be genetic variation in these seeds

402
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:50,970
their seeds made from plants I'm just

403
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:53,190
taking pollen and putting it on another

404
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:55,639
plant nature is making these seeds the

405
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:59,250
seeds come out we need to expect some

406
00:14:55,639 --> 00:15:01,889
variation Sunkiss is an f1 hybrid it is

407
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:04,230
not F tude it has not been worked to

408
00:15:01,889 --> 00:15:07,019
create more homogeneous phenotypes

409
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:09,120
I like the variation that come from f1

410
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:12,149
hybrids I like the bigger that comes

411
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:14,850
from an f1 hybrid so we need to learn to

412
00:15:12,149 --> 00:15:17,370
understand and accept the variation that

413
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:19,230
comes from seeds I like it I think that

414
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:20,759
growing from seed gives me the option to

415
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:23,100
find something that nobody else will

416
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:25,439
ever have if the entire neighborhood is

417
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:27,930
sharing clones everybody is growing the

418
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,970
same [ __ ] strain and in a couple of

419
00:15:27,929 --> 00:15:33,000
weeks everybody is going to be tired of

420
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:35,340
the same [ __ ] strain so if you buy a

421
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,320
pack of seeds and you find two or three

422
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:39,180
different phenotypes you've already got

423
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,800
two or three different things that set

424
00:15:39,179 --> 00:15:42,539
you apart from the market from the other

425
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:44,789
people that are growing that same clone

426
00:15:42,539 --> 00:15:46,649
that everybody in the hood is spreading

427
00:15:44,789 --> 00:15:47,969
around so now you were separating

428
00:15:46,649 --> 00:15:50,250
yourself from the market if you were

429
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:52,170
growing for profitability that is a

430
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:53,970
great way to set yourself apart then you

431
00:15:52,169 --> 00:15:55,829
select that best phenotype that works

432
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:57,480
the best for you you've got the one that

433
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:59,340
sells the best the one that works the

434
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,750
best for your gross style the one that

435
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:02,850
does what needs to be done in your

436
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:05,070
neighborhood and you can find that by

437
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:06,480
growing from seeds if you buy seeds and

438
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:08,340
nobody else in the hood bottom you're

439
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,870
the only one with that now you get to

440
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:11,610
grow that pack of seeds you get to find

441
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:13,110
a keeper phenotype then you get to

442
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:14,580
dominate the market because you've got

443
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:17,070
something that sets you apart from

444
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:18,660
everybody else so I really enjoy growing

445
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:20,460
from seed and I really enjoy the

446
00:16:18,659 --> 00:16:22,379
variation that I get when it comes to

447
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:24,090
growing from seed it's kind of like

448
00:16:22,379 --> 00:16:25,379
buying a pack of baseball cards or I

449
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:27,120
guess today you would say Magic the

450
00:16:25,379 --> 00:16:28,769
Gathering or [ __ ] pokemon cards or

451
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,899
something like that you get this pack of

452
00:16:28,769 --> 00:16:32,399
cards you get a pack of seeds and you go

453
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:33,929
home and instead of just opening it up

454
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,789
and going through and seeing how many

455
00:16:33,929 --> 00:16:37,439
lands and how many rare cards you've got

456
00:16:35,789 --> 00:16:39,149
or how many [ __ ] Mickey Mantle cards

457
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,500
you got you got to grow the seeds out

458
00:16:39,149 --> 00:16:42,360
you got ten seeds you put them in some

459
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,889
water you put them in some dirt and then

460
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,629
we nurture them for several weeks a

461
00:16:43,889 --> 00:16:47,009
couple of months probably and then at

462
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:49,080
the end of that we get to find out what

463
00:16:47,009 --> 00:16:50,879
cards came in that package of cards

464
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:52,290
because we just get a rare card that's

465
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:53,759
gonna help us win the game do we just

466
00:16:52,289 --> 00:16:55,319
get Mickey Mantle or do we just get a

467
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,509
bunch of LANs and a bunch of shortstops

468
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:59,760
that is the fun of growing from seed you

469
00:16:57,509 --> 00:17:01,919
get to find out what you get I really

470
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:03,689
find magic in that it makes me excited

471
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:05,700
to grow from a pack of seeds it's like

472
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:08,220
whoo I wonder what's in there and then I

473
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:11,130
am blessed I've got a lot of seeds so I

474
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:12,990
get to find many variations many

475
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:14,670
anomalies I get to see things from

476
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:17,160
populations that most people will never

477
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:19,440
get to see so growing from seed really

478
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:20,940
excites me I really love the variation

479
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:23,190
so let me try to get myself back on

480
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:25,200
track here you were correct those plants

481
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:27,630
are finished I would focus on the

482
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:29,610
trichomes on the but it's not as much as

483
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:31,260
the trichomes on the leaves we aren't

484
00:17:29,609 --> 00:17:32,669
too worried about the leaves those are

485
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:33,990
kind of bonus trichomes those are

486
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:35,940
secondary trichomes you're probably

487
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:38,460
gonna cut those off and throw them away

488
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:40,470
if they are not used for extraction so

489
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:42,870
focus on those trichomes on the buds you

490
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:44,970
said there are 20% amber it is probably

491
00:17:42,869 --> 00:17:47,250
time to harvest that plant hope you've

492
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:49,079
been flushing cuz it is time to cut down

493
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:50,788
now I hope you took a close

494
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:52,949
because you've got a phenotype that ends

495
00:17:50,788 --> 00:17:54,898
a little bit early and endures that

496
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:57,149
plant would be a dream it is very hard

497
00:17:54,898 --> 00:17:59,308
to find a plant that finishes around the

498
00:17:57,148 --> 00:18:02,849
48 day marker you can increase

499
00:17:59,308 --> 00:18:05,278
productivity by one full crop per year

500
00:18:02,849 --> 00:18:07,769
indoors if you have that phenotype and

501
00:18:05,278 --> 00:18:10,019
it is reliable and it creates a potent

502
00:18:07,769 --> 00:18:11,759
product that people want most of the

503
00:18:10,019 --> 00:18:13,288
time we are running eight or nine week

504
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:15,720
plants which will give us about five

505
00:18:13,288 --> 00:18:17,970
point seven harvests per year if we keep

506
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:20,339
a perpetual cycle going in one room if

507
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:23,100
you cut off those extra few days you

508
00:18:20,339 --> 00:18:25,378
give us the potential for one extra

509
00:18:23,099 --> 00:18:26,819
harvest in our room now based on the

510
00:18:25,378 --> 00:18:28,798
amount of white-sand square footage in

511
00:18:26,819 --> 00:18:30,960
that room that can be as much as one

512
00:18:28,798 --> 00:18:32,668
pound per year extra or in some

513
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,619
facilities where I work that could be as

514
00:18:32,669 --> 00:18:37,470
much as two hundred and fifty pounds

515
00:18:34,618 --> 00:18:39,118
extra product in one year so I think

516
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:41,069
you're really lucky really blessed to

517
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:43,199
have found a phenotype of Sunkist that

518
00:18:41,069 --> 00:18:45,148
ends at forty eight possibly fifty days

519
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,278
I hope it is a winner I hope it's a

520
00:18:45,148 --> 00:18:49,528
keeper I hope it is highly potent for

521
00:18:47,278 --> 00:18:52,378
you I hope it tastes amazing most of all

522
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:53,878
I really want to see some photos if you

523
