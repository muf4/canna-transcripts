00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,840
there let's just jump right into it i've

46
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,519
got a message from a previous episode in

47
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,200
the last episode i talked about my

48
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:51,039
strain grateful dog

49
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,600
i talked about an offshoot of grateful

50
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,880
dog that is known as 77 if you listen to

51
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:57,039
the episode you know what i'm talking

52
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:58,478
about if not give it a listen it's the

53
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,799
episode right before this titled

54
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:03,039
grateful dog you might enjoy it this

55
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,360
question goes like this it came from our

56
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,680
friend old ball coach and it says can we

57
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:10,478
in the irie army expect anything from

58
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,640
number 77 in the near future

59
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,080
thanks for what you do and then there's

60
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:16,079
more it says don't read this part on the

61
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,760
air so i won't read that part thank you

62
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,920
for that message i did read that part to

63
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:22,399
myself big respect nothing but love uh

64
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:24,238
the answer to your question though is uh

65
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,039
quick nah i don't have any plans for

66
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:29,599
number 77 for any uh commercial breeding

67
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:31,280
releases sometimes i do make and create

68
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:32,959
projects that uh kind of stick around

69
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,919
and they stay for myself for me to breed

70
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,680
with for me to work with 77 so far has

71
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:40,159
been kept a secret kept in the the

72
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,760
private reserve in the vault if you will

73
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:43,598
i have to have some things that i don't

74
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:45,280
release i have to have some things that

75
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:47,439
i can use as breeding stock in the

76
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,439
future if i release everything

77
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:51,280
you've got the potential to recreate

78
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:53,039
everything in my lineup you could

79
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,800
possibly recreate everything that i've

80
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:56,719
put out there if you acquired the right

81
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,400
strains did a little bit of homework did

82
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:00,400
some research did some final hunting did

83
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,360
some matching you can make a lot of my

84
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,039
line

85
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,720
however i do have some things that i've

86
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:06,479
bred that i have never put out there

87
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:08,080
i've got male plants that i've used that

88
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:10,079
i've never put out any of the seeds i've

89
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,760
got female plants i've pollinated that

90
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,000
nobody has ever seen those crosses i've

91
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:16,158
got kind of a secret arsenal my secret

92
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,840
weapons my hidden vault not everything

93
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:19,519
makes it out so there are some things

94
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,239
that have been played with with 77 but

95
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:24,640
nothing that will go out uh commercially

96
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,560
in the foreseeable future although the

97
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:28,719
market changes my ideas change my

98
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,799
opinions change sometimes you notice

99
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:32,400
that i uh i realize that some seeds have

100
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,719
been sitting in the vault in my secret

101
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,400
stash in my private reserve for far too

102
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:38,080
long and i begin to feel guilty about

103
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,158
that and i think those need to get out

104
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,159
to some friends and i will put those up

105
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:44,000
make them available for people in

106
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:46,560
certain avenues and certain places most

107
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,919
likely the discord server but that is

108
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,840
how i end up getting rid of some stuff

109
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:52,000
like that sometimes so maybe eventually

110
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,640
one day i'll decide that i've had some

111
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,598
of those number 77 cross too i'm not

112
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:57,759
even going to say what they've been

113
00:03:55,598 --> 00:03:59,438
pollinated by or

114
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:01,039
anyway we don't need to talk about i

115
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:03,039
almost i almost decided to go up that

116
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:05,199
route but uh maybe one day i'll release

117
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:06,878
some of those 77 seeds through uh some

118
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:08,238
of the avenues that we do on discord or

119
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:10,560
other things like that but right now

120
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:13,519
there are no plans no intentions that is

121
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:16,000
one of my hidden gems secret vaults uh

122
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,519
secret weapons private reserves uh once

123
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,040
everybody is tired of all these stuff

124
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,120
that i'm putting out once king solomon

125
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,639
runs his course and gets boring uh once

126
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,560
the jack the ripper mail gets boring

127
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,400
once the blueberry cookies mail gets

128
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,759
boring once the golden goat mail gets

129
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,799
boring so we've got a lot of stuff to

130
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,280
run through

131
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,759
then maybe we may play with some of the

132
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:35,918
stuff from 77 i've pollinated that with

133
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,280
a couple of things maybe in the future

134
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:39,918
all right now i'm just rambling at this

135
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:42,000
point the quick answer nah bro no plans

136
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:43,439
to put that one out to the public gotta

137
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,399
have some private reserve some secret

138
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:45,839
stash

139
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:48,000
all right let me cut myself off from a

140
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:50,799

166
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,759
like that that's what i used to say at

167
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,280
the start of the show i want everybody

168
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,600
to feel included involved and

169
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:49,758
participate uh somebody said that i do

170
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,199
talk to you guys like you've never grown

171
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,280
before and i said that's a good thing

172
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,879
because many of you out there never have

173
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:56,959
grown before but i also try to include

174
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:59,360
subjects topics and details that will

175
00:05:56,959 --> 00:06:02,000
keep even the most experienced seasoned

176
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,759
veteran growers entertained i'm rambling

177
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,038
once again but welcome to the show if

178
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,720
you didn't know i was gonna ramble you

179
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:07,839
must be new here thank you for the

180
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,479
compliment brother that's where i'm

181
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:12,478
headed it goes on it says i've received

182
00:06:10,478 --> 00:06:14,159
a pack of star struck seeds good

183
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:16,478
selection i believe those are sold out

184
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,919
in most venues i don't have any more i'm

185
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:20,639
not going to make anymore so you were

186
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:22,799
lucky to have those it says i've been

187
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:25,439
growing and just wanted to send you an

188
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,840
update i appreciate that i also must say

189
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:30,160
that the pheno i have is perfectly

190
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:32,079
structured a perfectly structured plant

191
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,240
it's beautiful from the aroma to

192
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:35,599
structure and resistance i can't wait to

193
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,960
oh we're going to skip that i can't wait

194
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,680
to send you some flower picks i thought

195
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:39,279
you're going to say you're going to see

196
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,560
me flower wasn't going to read that on

197
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:43,359
the air it says can't wait to send you

198
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,839
some flower picks as well as try to self

199
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,639
and reverse her with my

200
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:50,239
motivation pheno i've been working with

201
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,000
or i had to change pages here so there's

202
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,639
a lot going on there he says that the

203
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,879
starstruck plant is perfectly structured

204
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:59,360
uh that is part of why i selected it the

205
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:00,879
star dog plant they worked with that was

206
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,280
beautifully structured it was one of my

207
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:06,000
favorite in the commercial grow i gave a

208
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:08,079
very nice structure very wonderful aroma

209
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,560
beautiful bag appeal and like you said

210
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:12,399
here it was resistant to problems on a

211
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,918
commercial grow we would experience a

212
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:16,000
myriad of problems throughout the

213
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:17,279
seasons we'd get mites powdery mildew

214
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,598
there's always something to learn how to

215
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:21,119
battle in a new grow and the star dog

216
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:22,800
just didn't seem to get it that's part

217
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,038
of why i decided to

218
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,639
kidnap that plant and breed it uh breed

219
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:28,318
with it put it in my breeding program it

220
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,199
was a great plant just the original mom

221
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,879
plant

222
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,478
that's where a lot of these traits are

223
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:34,879
coming from is from that original star

224
00:07:32,478 --> 00:07:37,120
dog then like i like to say arise king

225
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:38,879
solomon that it is just the fixer that

226
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,879
is the turbo charger that's like uh

227
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:42,079
sending it to training camp any plan you

228
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:43,439
put in the room with that it just went

229
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:45,439
through a six-week camp and it'll come

230
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:47,519
out ready for fighting uh it's ready to

231
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:49,519
make weight ready to tap a [ __ ]

232
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:51,439
out i am rambling it's been a good day

233
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:52,959
been smoking all the good [ __ ] let me

234
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:54,478
find out where i am in this message i'm

235
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:56,719
on page two

236
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:58,399
so our friend has found a star dog fino

237
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,240
they love they're considering reversing

238
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:02,799
it preserving it and crossing it with

239
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,240
their motivation phenotype they've been

240
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,800
working with and it says keep up the

241
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,840
awesomeness p.s a quick question this is

242
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:12,240
where the fun part comes in does a plant

243
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:14,399
does a plant's structure change with

244
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,639
maturity and then he says an example

245
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:19,279
nodes changing from growing across from

246
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,879
one another to staggered node spacing i

247
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:23,359
ask because i've experienced something

248
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:25,439
similar with a star struck clone it

249
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,840
looks structurally different from the

250
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:29,199
parent plant what do you think that's a

251
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:31,758
very good question brian i've got a

252
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:33,519
couple of different theories here a

253
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:36,000
couple of things that could be happening

254
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:37,839
possibly my first question my first

255
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,918
theory my first idea the very first

256
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:42,719
thing that comes to mind is where did

257
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:44,480
you cut the clones from if you cut it

258
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,000
from the main meristem you're probably

259
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,000
going to get the the symmetry the

260
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,839
symmetrical branching

261
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,919
that was harder than it looked to say

262
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:53,440
symmetrical branching you'll get that

263
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:55,519
from the main meristem however if you

264
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,040
cut from some of the side branches then

265
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,639
maybe you'll get some shoots or maybe

266
00:08:57,039 --> 00:09:00,639
even the opposite on some plants it kind

267
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:01,360
of depends on how the plant grows

268
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:03,039
but

269
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,879
for most of my experience if you cut the

270
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:07,039
top you're going to get the symmetry if

271
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:08,799
you come from the sides you may get that

272
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:10,399
uh the opposites which you're talking

273
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:13,039
about staggered node spacing is what

274
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:15,039
you're saying i think my first uh

275
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:18,159
suspicion is that it would come from

276
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:20,559
location in which those plants uh those

277
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:22,159
clones particular clones were cut i have

278
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:24,479
no evidence of that i wasn't there i

279
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:26,000
didn't see anything i've got very

280
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,839
little information to go on i've got

281
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,839
about a paragraph about three sentences

282
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,120
here to work with so that is my first

283
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,360
guess

284
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,360
then

285
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,920
then let's just talk about some other

286
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:40,240
phenomenon uh that could be happening

287
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:42,079
there phenomena phenomenon things that

288
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,519
could be happening there i try to sound

289
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,360
like a professional sometimes i don't

290
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,799
know what the hell i'm even saying uh

291
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,759
some other things that we should keep in

292
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:51,439
mind is just phenotypical expression has

293
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:52,879
the room change is the environment

294
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,080
different that could make a big

295
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:55,360
difference in the way that the plant

296
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,480
grows i don't know that that would

297
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,000
necessarily change the uh the staggered

298
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,759
node spacing but that is going to make a

299
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,039
difference in the way that the plant

300
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:04,159
would grow in a different room i just

301
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:06,000
want to talk about that because that's a

302
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:08,639
fun avenue to go down phenotypical

303
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,958
expression if we took the same plant and

304
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:12,319
we cut 10 clones and we didn't take one

305
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:13,919
out of the main meristem we took it from

306
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,480
the branches all around the size we had

307
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:18,319
10 beautiful clones we gave them to 10

308
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,600
different growers to put in 10 different

309
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:23,200
rooms we may see 10 wildly different

310
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,800
results the flowers are going to look

311
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,440
smell taste

312
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:29,199
and affect us all differently based on

313
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,320
things in their grow first of all we've

314
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,160
got

315
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,600
so there's like lights air water soil

316
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:35,759
all that stuff to think about the light

317
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,759
is probably our first factor uh one

318
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:40,159
person a lot of people nowadays will

319
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:41,759
probably grow under an led some people

320
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:44,799
are going to grow under ceramic metal

321
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:46,879
halides somebody will grow under an hps

322
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:48,559
light somebody's gonna grow still under

323
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:50,799
a [ __ ] stolen street light that they

324
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:52,319
got from way back in the day uh

325
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:54,078
somebody's gonna use some cheap ass

326
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,480
blurple light somebody who's gonna use

327
00:10:54,078 --> 00:10:58,799
the most expensive [ __ ] led on the

328
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,560
market so that's lighting that's right

329
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:02,399
there we've got so many variables the

330
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:03,838
guy using that hps that he stole

331
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,399
compared to the guy using the super

332
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:08,720
expensive led he's got that r switch on

333
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,559
there so he's giving him far red light

334
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,560
way different effects from those lights

335
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:14,479
compared to these uh the stolen shop

336
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:16,159
light and way different effect compared

337
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,600
to all of those compared to that ceramic

338
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:20,159
metal halide maybe someone's running a

339
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,839
t5 the whole grow lots of variables for

340
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:23,838
lighting that's going to give us

341
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:26,000
different shapes different structures a

342
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:28,000
different bud density is going to be

343
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,839
something we definitely notice from that

344
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,519
then let's talk about air it is

345
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,440
definitely going to be a different

346
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:36,639
temperature and different humidity

347
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,079
different basic vpd in every grow it's

348
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:40,240
going to be a couple of points off no

349
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:41,359
matter which grow we go to either the

350
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,959
temperature will be different the

351
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,879
humidity will be different the diurnal

352
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:47,199
swings will be different it's going to

353
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:48,720
be different in every grow i promise you

354
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,079
all of the grows you'll have noticeable

355
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,720
differences

356
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:56,479
that is going to affect plant structure

357
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:59,200
leaf shape and size bud density bud size

358
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,278
flavor terpenes aroma stickiness of the

359
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,920
overall final product that's going to

360
00:12:01,278 --> 00:12:06,000
have a big role in your whole room the

361
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:08,159
vpd makes a big difference you got 10

362
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,480
different rooms one guy the guy running

363
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:11,759
that stolen hps he's probably got a hot

364
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,159
room also his buds are going to get

365
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:15,919
fluffy he's going to encourage more

366
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:18,000
limonine production he's going to have

367
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:18,719
taller more slender plants the guy with

368
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,879
the

369
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,240
the plant with the r switch on his led

370
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:24,639
his plants are going to be shorter

371
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,720
squattier maybe better node spacing

372
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,079
maybe denser buds there's going to be

373
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,519
differences throughout just because of

374
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:31,359
the lighting and the way that the

375
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,159
humidity are affecting each other i'm

376
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,519
saying there's going to be a lot of

377
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:35,199
variables let me get to the point here

378
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,959
because i can ramble on this forever

379
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,040
we've still got nutrients to talk about

380
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:40,799
we've got soil to talk about it could be

381
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:41,838
cocoa it could be hydroponic all of

382
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:43,838
these things are going to make a

383
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:45,279
difference in how the plants perform

384
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:46,240
you'll see different growth structures

385
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:49,360
shapes

386
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:51,839
the leaves can change size and shape not

387
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,360
completely drastically but they can

388
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,360
show you a little bit thinner leaf in a

389
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,360
higher humidity environment a thicker

390
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,278
leaf and a lower maybe even the opposite

391
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,120
it's all about where the plant came from

392
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:03,200
and how it is replying or reacting or

393
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,278
responding to the environment which you

394
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,200
have now stuck that plant in that is the

395
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:09,600
phenotypical expression that you're

396
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,040
gonna see so uh what you could be seeing

397
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,879
the short version of what i'm trying to

398
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:14,958
say is this could just be phenotypical

399
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:16,240
expression maybe the room has changed

400
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:18,399
maybe you're growing it in a different

401
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,639
room than you did before uh maybe it's

402
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:22,879
just changed also this plant is aging in

403
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,720
life if you're taking a clone from a

404
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:26,639
plant and taking a clone from a plant

405
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,399
the plant is continuing to age that

406
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,480
plant's as old as that original plant

407
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:33,278
that you started with so there is age in

408
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,399
that plant maybe it has changed um

409
00:13:33,278 --> 00:13:36,240
it is not

410
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:38,078
genetic drift that is technically not

411
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,680
what genetic drift is but there is a

412
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:41,919
technical word that will not come to my

413
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:44,319
brain right now the plants basically do

414
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:46,240
change they can change over time uh

415
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,399
everything changes over time that is

416
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:51,360
very possible that could be happening

417
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:53,600
so my main three options are going to be

418
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,440
uh where you cut the clone from then

419
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,440
it's going to be phenotypical change

420
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,199
then also it's something with the

421
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,120
hormones and changes of the plant the

422
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:03,359
plant is just evolving it's getting

423
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,839
older those all three could be very

424
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,519
possible very likely culprits for what

425
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:10,639
is happening what you are experiencing

426
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:12,240
in your garden all right brian 4 20. i

427
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,600
think i rambled on long enough about

428
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,360
that one i want to thank you for a great

429
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,800
question if you've got any more

430
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,039
follow-up questions you know i'd love to

431
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:20,639
hear from you uh everybody the email

432
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:23,599
address is grow from your heart at

433
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:25,759
hotmail.com don't be shy reach out i do

434
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,440
love the listener interaction

435
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:30,078
all right this next message comes from

436
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:32,560
my friend mud and it goes a little bit

437
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:34,879
like this it says ross to jeff i

438
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:37,278
recently purchased some morning dew reg

439
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:39,759
seeds from seeds here now big shout out

440
00:14:37,278 --> 00:14:42,078
to our friends at seeds herenow.com it

441
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:44,000
says i would like to breed a plant to my

442
00:14:42,078 --> 00:14:46,638
kim dog variety to introduce the

443
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,839
anti-powdery mildew anti-bud rot

444
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:52,240
properties to my cam so if you've been

445
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:54,720
following my brand or my podcast for a

446
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:57,039
while you know that my line morning dew

447
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,759
has been discovered that is very

448
00:14:57,039 --> 00:15:01,439
resistant to powdery mildew and bud rot

449
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:03,838
the past couple of outdoor seasons we've

450
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,839
seen a lot of gardens get decimated by

451
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,279
powdery mildew and by bud rot the

452
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,360
morning dew we've gotten a lot of

453
00:15:07,278 --> 00:15:11,439
reports that it withstood all of those

454
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,039
stresses plants next to it we're getting

455
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,279
mildew plants next to it we're getting

456
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:17,120
rot and the morning do withstood all of

457
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:19,360
the struggles

458
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,600
so our friend mud here wants to get a

459
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:25,278
quality morning do mail and breed that

460
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:27,680
to his chem dog varietal female now it

461
00:15:25,278 --> 00:15:29,600
goes on to say i know it's your indica i

462
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:31,278
know it's your version of an indica i've

463
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,278
been following the podcast for a while

464
00:15:31,278 --> 00:15:36,240
now and i haven't heard you speak much

465
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:38,799
about this is there a reason why

466
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,079
um no i just don't uh without being

467
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:41,758
prompted i don't really talk too much

468
00:15:40,078 --> 00:15:44,159
about my strains i've done full strain

469
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,839
reports i think i've done a full strain

470
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:47,838
report on the morning dew talking about

471
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:50,399
the way it grows the way it smokes i'm

472
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:52,320
not sure if we knew about the uh

473
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:54,078
resistance to powdery mildew at the time

474
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,600
a lot more people have grown it the

475
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:57,439
plant has been the seeds have been sold

476
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,560
the plant has been experienced more so i

477
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,720
don't know how much of that i talked

478
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:02,159
about in that old episode uh there's no

479
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,240
reason i don't talk about the morning

480
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:06,078
dew or that it's being uh one of my

481
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,198
indicas or anything it's just uh like i

482
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:08,559
said i don't really talk about the

483
00:16:07,198 --> 00:16:10,078
strains without being prompted you have

484
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:12,479
to ask a question which you did here so

485
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:14,000
we will talk about it um

486
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:17,278
and i talked about the grateful dog in

487
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,720
the last episode so uh the grateful dog

488
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:21,278
is the uh the morning dew is the

489
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,600
grateful dog pollinated by king solomon

490
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:24,799
and most of the phenotypes seem to put

491
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,519
off a

492
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:29,198
more indica type quality than the sativa

493
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,799
type qualities they finish more quickly

494
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:33,439
than most sativas the buzz is more

495
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:35,758
indica dominant it grows more with the

496
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,519
wider leaf type of a structure some of

497
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:39,839
the phenotypes do have skinnier leaves

498
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:42,240
but the plants stay short and squat and

499
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:43,680
the buds get dense uh more more like

500
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,919
what we know as an indica or what i

501
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:47,120
would qualify classify as an indica it

502
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:48,399
will get you in your head a little bit

503
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,679
when you smoke it but it's going to be

504
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,278
more that

505
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:52,399
i'm going to say more of an indica

506
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:54,958
varietal

507
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:56,720
than it says i haven't ever bred before

508
00:16:54,958 --> 00:17:00,239
but i thought this would be a good cross

509
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:02,160
my kim has almost uh satsuma hazy funk

510
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,759
super triked out and the yields are no

511
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:06,000
problem but it does have a problem with

512
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:08,318
powdery mildew then it goes on to say my

513
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,078
question is two parts

514
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:12,318
do you mind if i breed with it it's for

515
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:14,480
personal i'm not selling the beans and

516
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:17,359
then can you give me a breakdown of what

517
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:20,318
type of phenotypes to expect in advance

518
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:22,159
uh you can call me mud as my friends do

519
00:17:20,318 --> 00:17:23,438
and thank you in advance all right mud

520
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,519
thank you for the great message thank

521
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:28,079
you for the good questions let's answer

522
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:30,240
your questions about the morning dew and

523
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:32,399
breeding with it i feel this way about

524
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,359
all of my strains any seeds that you buy

525
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,400
from me

526
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:38,879
once you've given me or a vendor or a

527
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,798
trader or anybody money for those seeds

528
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,799
they are yours you can do whatever you

529
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:45,038
want with them and i can't be mad about

530
00:17:42,798 --> 00:17:47,119
it you've paid money my job is to make

531
00:17:45,038 --> 00:17:49,119
the seeds make quality seeds test them

532
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:51,678
make sure they're reliable get them out

533
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:53,678
to you at that point basically i got

534
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:55,360
paid my end of the bargain is up i make

535
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:57,120
sure you get quality customer service if

536
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:58,798
you have a problem if you have an issue

537
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:00,639
i'm here for that but

538
00:17:58,798 --> 00:18:03,359
those seeds are yours grow them have fun

539
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,880
breed with them uh do what you must you

540
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:07,119
paid your money for them that's like me

541
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,559
telling you ah you can't drive your car

542
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:09,918
as fast as you want once you bought the

543
00:18:08,558 --> 00:18:13,200
car once you bought the seeds bro

544
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:15,440
they're yours have a good time also

545
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,840
be respectful about that there is kind

546
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,519
of a breeder's code of ethics there is a

547
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:22,480
code of ethics you notice when i make a

548
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:25,359
cross i always list the true genetics of

549
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,798
what that cross is i reveal almost

550
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:28,479
everything to you guys i like to be

551
00:18:26,798 --> 00:18:30,000
transparent i feel like you guys trust

552
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:33,679
me and believe in me because of my

553
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,038
transparency so in return whenever you

554
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,798
put out a seat or whatever you do

555
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:39,119
whatever you post a picture of it just

556
00:18:36,798 --> 00:18:41,759
maybe put in little parentheses this is

557
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:43,839
ross to jeff's morning due to my uh what

558
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:45,759
was it called uh motivation i think you

559
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:48,079
called it or do it correctly uh when you

560
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:50,319
list genetics list the ladies first it's

561
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:52,399
always ladies first so girl plant x male

562
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:54,558
plant in the parentheses there but if

563
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,160
you ever talk about it list it advertise

564
00:18:54,558 --> 00:18:57,759
it promote it if somebody says what is

565
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,120
that just give me a shout out give me a

566
00:18:57,759 --> 00:19:01,759
fist bump give me some credit give me

567
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:04,239
some love that's all i ask for uh you

568
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:05,359
notice when i talk about um a lot of

569
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,720
strains that i work with a lot of

570
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:08,159
strains that i breed with i tell you

571
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,558
straight up who they came from who i got

572
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:12,160
the cuts from i didn't invent cannabis i

573
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:13,678
didn't invent seeds

574
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,200
i didn't just fart out a bunch of seeds

575
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:17,759
and start with those i had to get plants

576
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,120
and seeds from other breeders other

577
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:22,079
people that were putting out quality

578
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:23,038
products things i enjoyed trusted

579
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:25,759
liked

580
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:28,000
relied on was impressed by uh by

581
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:29,679
breeders that i like also if i only work

582
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,519
with strains from breeders that i enjoy

583
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,960
also you gotta be kind of a cool person

584
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:34,400
uh if i find out that you're not super

585
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,160
cool maybe i'll eliminate your plants

586
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,600
from my garden uh things like that do

587
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,440
matter to me at this point and i've got

588
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:41,199
the opportunity to be very selective and

589
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:44,240
picky at this point also

590
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,519
ah but i ramble on my point is once i've

591
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,120
sold you those seeds dude you could do

592
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:49,038
whatever you want with them i appreciate

593
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:51,599
that you like my seedline enough and you

594
00:19:49,038 --> 00:19:53,119
trust in what i've said and the reviews

595
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:55,199
and you trust in the product enough that

596
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:57,359
you've chosen to breed that to your

597
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,120
seeds uh to try to make a better product

598
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:00,879
to fix the problem in there now you see

599
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:03,038
what i'm saying by uh saying that king

600
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,039
solomon is the fixer you're going to use

601
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:07,359
the morning due to try to be the fixer

602
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:09,679
you found the recipe to make your pie a

603
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:11,119
little bit better i am rambling so the

604
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:13,280
overall answer to part one of your

605
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:14,879
question is yes you do have full

606
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:16,480
permission to breed with the seeds that

607
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,080
you get from me

608
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,599
just give me give me some credit give me

609
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:21,279
some respect anybody out there if you

610
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:23,439
breed with my seeds

611
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:25,918
my plants my clones whatever just show

612
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,759
me love give me respect maybe

613
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,960
send me a 10 pack if you can not a big

614
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:30,558
deal honestly i don't have a lot of room

615
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,720
to run a lot of stuff but if it's super

616
00:20:30,558 --> 00:20:35,200
intriguing you may see pictures of your

617
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:37,120
cross pop up on my social media pop up

618
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,200
in my crosses in the future maybe i'll

619
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:40,879
send you more [ __ ] and return we can

620
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,720
establish friendships in relationships

621
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,559
like that i try to get seeds back to the

622
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,640
people who give me clones and things i

623
00:20:44,558 --> 00:20:48,399
try to keep the circle going all right

624
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:51,120
let me keep going because there is a

625
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,880
second part to our buddy mud's question

626
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:55,279
it says uh could you give me a breakdown

627
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,799
in the phenos to expect from the morning

628
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:58,558
dew

629
00:20:56,798 --> 00:21:00,879
like i said i've done the full podcast

630
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:02,960
on the morning do uh if you search the

631
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,480
grow from your heart podcast morning do

632
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,120
there should be a full episode but we

633
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:09,038
will do a quick phenotype expectation

634
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:11,918
run down here since you're gonna breed

635
00:21:09,038 --> 00:21:14,000
with it um there are three main

636
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:16,000
phenotypical categories and i've stopped

637
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,919
saying main phenotypes i'm going to

638
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,798
start putting phenotypes into categories

639
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:21,759
because

640
00:21:18,798 --> 00:21:23,440
i'm a category kind of guy and it sets a

641
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:26,000
better expectation you're not looking

642
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:28,640
for this specific plant i like that

643
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
you're looking for specific phenotypes

644
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,400
but also i want you to find the one

645
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,798
that's good for you it's like if if i

646
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,798
say i like this phenotype you may pass

647
00:21:34,798 --> 00:21:38,319
on the one that would have been stellar

648
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:40,000
for you because you chose the one that's

649
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:41,678
great for me and you could add something

650
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,200
better and i

651
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:44,559
i always explain like we went to a

652
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,919
restaurant you narrowed it down that you

653
00:21:44,558 --> 00:21:47,678
want italian food and we sat at the

654
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:49,280
restaurant read the menu i'm gonna get

655
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:51,038
something garlicky with white sauce you

656
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:52,639
might want something with red sauce the

657
00:21:51,038 --> 00:21:54,480
other person might not want any sauce

658
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,559
they might just get buttery pasta we've

659
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,240
all we've all established we want

660
00:21:56,558 --> 00:22:00,000
morning dew but i might want a different

661
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,440
phenotype of morning do than you you

662
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,279
might want the cushy one i might want

663
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,720
the gassy one somebody else might want

664
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:06,558
the one with the berry funk at the end

665
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,880
of it so find the phenotype that works

666
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:11,119
best for you as my my bottom line my

667
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:13,039
best advice now the phenotypical

668
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:14,479
categories which you can expect from the

669
00:22:13,038 --> 00:22:17,519
morning do

670
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:20,558
there is the og kush leaner there's one

671
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:23,440
that has got cushy rocks to it

672
00:22:20,558 --> 00:22:25,359
that one grows it's got a stretchier

673
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,558
structure and it grows a bunch of rocks

674
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:28,959
that one is going to be great it's going

675
00:22:26,558 --> 00:22:31,359
to be cushy gassy mothballs

676
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,960
real pungent then there's another which

677
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:35,279
i call the it's the chem leaning

678
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,440
phenotype which you can identify by the

679
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:39,200
acorn style buds

680
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,919
it doesn't grow real long buds it

681
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,519
doesn't grow real chunky rocky buds but

682
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:45,440
they're shaped like a pine cone they're

683
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:47,839
just nice perfect triangles and they're

684
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:50,000
all over the plant that phenotype tends

685
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:52,480
to turn a little bit purple a little bit

686
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,720
silver a little bit darker colors then

687
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,400
of course there is the arise dominant

688
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,319
phenotype that is the phenotype that

689
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,798
gets spears that is the one that makes

690
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:02,558
the long spears so if you've got rocks

691
00:23:00,798 --> 00:23:04,639
it's going to be more cushy if you got

692
00:23:02,558 --> 00:23:06,319
pine cones that's more chemi

693
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,400
if you get the spears that's going to

694
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:10,079
have a lot of a rise in it

695
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,240
now it sounds like in your situation

696
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:13,759
you're going to need a male plant so i

697
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,359
would find a male plant with a nice

698
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:17,359
structure just look for the one that is

699
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:19,439
shaped the way you want it to be shaped

700
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:21,119
you're probably going to get a five

701
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,120
maybe a ten pack of seeds maybe more

702
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:25,678
than that but out of the male plants

703
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:27,279
that you get the first if you've got a

704
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:30,480
10 pack you're probably gonna get five

705
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:32,960
males i would eliminate those first two

706
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:35,200
super hyper vigorous males just get rid

707
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:38,000
of them my reason for that is they're

708
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,679
going to add too much to the mix when

709
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,839
we're breeding most of the time the goal

710
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:43,759
is to kind of combine the two plants and

711
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:45,199
see the representation of both parents

712
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:47,519
in your offspring unless you're trying

713
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,440
to lock down one specific trait i like

714
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:51,759
to see what the male and the female can

715
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,840
do together if you've got a male plant

716
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:55,519
that is just too dominant in the mix

717
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:57,439
it'll wash out all of the traits of the

718
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:59,839
female and you're basically reproducing

719
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,440
that male plant so i like to find a male

720
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:02,319
that's not a real meat head not just

721
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,558
real

722
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:07,439
super aggressive super vigorous too

723
00:24:04,558 --> 00:24:09,440
crazy to flower early uh grows real

724
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,679
crazy tall that's not the dude that i

725
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,200
would use if i had five seeds the third

726
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:15,278
and fourth seeds are probably the

727
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,200
candidates the third and fourth males to

728
00:24:15,278 --> 00:24:19,038
show me that they're males uh to show

729
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,759
their vigor their aggression i guess it

730
00:24:19,038 --> 00:24:21,440
is

731
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:24,079
those are going to be the two that i

732
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,840
start uh really eyeballing as my males

733
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:27,199
so find a good male find somebody with

734
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:29,359
good structure find somebody that

735
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,840
flowers at the appropriate time find a

736
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:33,678
male that puts out a decent amount of

737
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:34,959
pollen do the stem rub i like a male

738
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:36,080
plant so you're going to grow it the

739
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,558
morning dew

740
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:40,960
look for the one that smells like vomit

741
00:24:38,558 --> 00:24:42,960
i know it sounds crazy male plants when

742
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,960
you rub the stem if it smells like acrid

743
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:47,519
puke that is always a good trait and a

744
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:49,360
male plant in my opinion that's just my

745
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:52,400
opinion that's from my experience i love

746
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:55,439
that disgusting acrid

747
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:57,600
vomit puke bar trash can gross smells

748
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:00,240
that always turns into a good male plant

749
00:24:57,599 --> 00:25:02,158
that good puts out good terps and it's

750
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,480
uh and it's progeny the offspring will

751
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:06,480
always smell really good if the male

752
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,640
plant smells like vomit

753
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,240
so i would work on finding a good male

754
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,759
plant you're not going to see

755
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,798
the bud structure that we see from the

756
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:15,359
females because you're going to be

757
00:25:12,798 --> 00:25:17,200
looking for a boy so find a good shape

758
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:19,119
find a good structure

759
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,798
find one with big thick robust stems

760
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:22,399
that you can work and bin and it doesn't

761
00:25:20,798 --> 00:25:23,759
explode when you pop and twist it

762
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,919
because you want the progeny to keep

763
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:26,640
that trait as well find one that puts

764
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:28,400
out

765
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:31,038
pollen in the right amount of time

766
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:33,038
if you can finish this male plan out see

767
00:25:31,038 --> 00:25:35,919
how far they go put a few male plants in

768
00:25:33,038 --> 00:25:37,440
a room isolate them let them flower out

769
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:38,799
see which one you like the best do a

770
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,120
phenotype just like you do with the

771
00:25:38,798 --> 00:25:43,278
females look at the bud cluster look at

772
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:45,119
the color do the uh do the male plants

773
00:25:43,278 --> 00:25:47,759
put out any color are the male flowers

774
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:49,519
turning purple uh do they put out

775
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:52,158
trichomes do they smell good when they

776
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:54,000
put out buds then uh do they get

777
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:55,760
deficiencies do they handle your feeding

778
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,558
well do you have any bugs do those male

779
00:25:55,759 --> 00:26:00,079
plants get beat up by bugs uh later on

780
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:01,839
in the life of the plant how bad do

781
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:03,759
those leaves start crinkling up how long

782
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:05,918
does it last that's going to tell you a

783
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:08,640
lot about the offspring what you see in

784
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:11,520
that male plant is 50 of what you're

785
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:13,919
going to see in the offspring so find a

786
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:15,679
a good combo a good pairing for your

787
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,759
plant that you call motivation i think

788
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:19,759
that is that's going to be so i say this

789
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:21,359
a lot when it comes to breeding

790
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:24,240
learn about mendel charts learn about

791
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:27,119
alleles learn about chromosome transfer

792
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:29,038
learn all of that stuff then forget it

793
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:30,319
all look at two plants and say those are

794
00:26:29,038 --> 00:26:32,480
the two plants right there that need to

795
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:34,558
be bred together use the grower and

796
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:36,880
breeder intuition i think that will work

797
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:38,639
great for you understand the charts

798
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,919
understand the science understand the

799
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,880
biology

800
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:42,559
then

801
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,559
understand that you've got to grow from

802
00:26:42,558 --> 00:26:46,240
your heart breed with love that's how i

803
00:26:44,558 --> 00:26:48,240
have the greatest success i draw the

804
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,079
charts i think about the mendel charts i

805
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,159
really envision it in my head and then i

806
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:53,439
go no you know what that plant and that

807
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:54,640
plant right there need to make some

808
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,759
seeds and it's going to be [ __ ]

809
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:59,759
awesome most of the time i am correct so

810
00:26:57,759 --> 00:27:01,679
develop your intuition check out the

811
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:03,759
plants like i said grow from your heart

812
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:05,600
the bottom line breed with love you're

813
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:07,038
making this cross for yourself you're

814
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:09,839
going to have a lot of seeds to play

815
00:27:07,038 --> 00:27:11,599
with there will be a resistant phenotype

816
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:13,519
within that first mix you'll find a

817
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:16,000
couple a bunch hopefully in there you'll

818
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:17,599
find what you're looking for ah almost

819
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,519
no matter which male you select that

820
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:21,439
trait will pop up it'll be there it is

821
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:23,278
in the mix it's in the gene pool i do

822
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,240
believe you'll find that resistance

823
00:27:23,278 --> 00:27:26,798
trait

824
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:29,278

825
00:27:26,798 --> 00:27:31,519
i've got for this episode uh my buddy

827
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:36,480
have got primus songs stuck in my head

828
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:38,080
now um also i did say there are three

829
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,759
categories of phenotypes i have another

830
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:41,199
note here there are some weirdos when

831
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:43,200
you're growing the morning dew you're

832
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:45,120
gonna see some weirdos some of them

833
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,798
start off kind of strange

834
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:48,319
be patient they grow right out of their

835
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:50,158
weirdness a lot of those morning do

836
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:52,398
weirdos they snap out of it and they

837
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:54,000
turn into beautiful amazing plants so if

838
00:27:52,398 --> 00:27:56,158
you've got some weird [ __ ] happening

839
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,398
with your morning dew babies have no

840
00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:00,240
fear they will grow out of it sometimes

841
00:27:58,398 --> 00:28:02,000
we just have ugly babies not all babies

842

843
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,798
uh they'll grow right out of it though

844
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,080
