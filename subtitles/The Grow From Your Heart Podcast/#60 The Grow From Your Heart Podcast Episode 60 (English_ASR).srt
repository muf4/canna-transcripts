1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:04,120
I don't know about you guys but I've

2
00:00:02,948 --> 00:00:08,460
been walking around singing Noble

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:08,460
Nebraska for like a week now yeah yep

4
00:00:09,058 --> 00:00:17,769
Nebraska yeah it's a yeah the only

5
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:19,839
downfall is they used a lot of inside

6
00:00:17,769 --> 00:00:21,399
jokes you know like and they tried to

7
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:22,839
explain him to the best of the ability

8
00:00:21,399 --> 00:00:25,449
but it's it's more one of those things

9
00:00:22,839 --> 00:00:27,129
you had to bend there's getting no I was

10
00:00:25,449 --> 00:00:29,530
just laughing every time they would say

11
00:00:27,129 --> 00:00:31,868
something like ham wallet or so that the

12
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:33,789
ham wall at the beginning was I don't it

13
00:00:31,868 --> 00:00:35,920
got pushed off like it wasn't anything

14
00:00:33,789 --> 00:00:37,750
and the idea I was letting [ __ ] just

15
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,880
slide by because the more I was like ah

16
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:41,320
[ __ ] the more it came out it is fun to

17
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,989
do but it was fun just letting some [ __ ]

18
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:45,880
slide too and you you would hear one of

19
00:00:43,988 --> 00:00:48,219
them like every everyone throughout the

20
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:50,859

buddy Mitch Inasa shout out Mitch he

79
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:59,620
said that when you're dab in every hour

80
00:02:56,409 --> 00:03:02,289
becomes 45 minutes of productive time so

81
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:03,969
then I kind of believe him I would have

82
00:03:02,289 --> 00:03:05,739
agree I would argue with that between

83
00:03:03,969 --> 00:03:08,319
sativa and indica you know I'm saying

84
00:03:05,739 --> 00:03:10,390
you're a real big sativa guy and usually

85
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,889
if I come over hangar real ripped-off

86
00:03:10,389 --> 00:03:13,949

00:03:13,949 --> 00:03:18,399
where where do we need to I kind of get

89
00:03:16,659 --> 00:03:20,169

90
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,730

160
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:43,139
like they didn't make it popular but

161
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:45,389
they put out the seeds of the sfv and

26th at hydro indoor growing supplies I

299
00:10:23,029 --> 00:10:27,110

300
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:28,879

301
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:30,860

302
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:32,299

305
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,460
you're coming to the meeting let me know

306
00:10:36,019 --> 00:10:39,470
what you'd like me to talk about the Gro

307
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:40,700
meeting April 26th at Highgrove indoor

308
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:41,990
growing supplies I'll talk about that

309
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:44,990
more in the future keep reminding you

310
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:46,240
guys and I felt like the last meeting

311
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:48,649
like a lot of stuff has talked about

312
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,389
pretense but then when it came down to

313
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:52,129
who's got any questions everybody was

314
00:10:50,389 --> 00:10:54,439
maybe a little embarrassed to speak up

315
00:10:52,129 --> 00:10:55,939
in front of the crowd and it wasn't it's

316
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,230
because you're in a community growers

317
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:58,970
and I don't think that should be the

318
00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:01,220
place to be embarrassed that's the place

319
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:02,240
to get help true I mean yeah but nobody

320
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,560
wanted to show that they were yellow

321
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,480
belts when there were fifth degree black

00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:42,360
of the pot and putting it into the

373
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:45,420
recycling bin for soil it's a serious

374
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:48,269
privilege [ __ ] do your tay mover yeah

375
00:12:45,419 --> 00:12:51,299
I get to play with dirt all day did you

376
00:12:48,269 --> 00:12:53,189
see and in the past 20 pasta we have

377
00:12:51,299 --> 00:12:55,679
harvested have you seen a massive

378
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:58,470
increase in my root mass yeah the the

379
00:12:55,679 --> 00:13:00,809
amount of root material in these pots is

380
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:03,389
insane lately people I've been I've been

381
00:13:00,809 --> 00:13:05,129
breaking up dirt pots for sighs [ __ ]

382
00:13:03,389 --> 00:13:08,370
disgustingly long in my time now I think

383
00:13:05,129 --> 00:13:10,460
about it but uh everybody's been

384
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:12,840
breaking over old pot and had like a

385
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:15,090
handful of little tiny sad-ass root

386
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:16,410
there and lately you've got to smash the

387
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:18,840
root ball against the wall for a little

388
00:13:16,409 --> 00:13:20,370
bit just to give it some dirt back it's

389
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,660
been intense and they're not in there

390
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:22,950
any longer you're gonna say we just let

391
00:13:21,659 --> 00:13:24,839
them grow more time now they're actually

392
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:26,370
in there shorter because I ran this crop

393
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,780
really quickly I wanted to get something

394
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:29,220
that's kind of cropped up they're not

395
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:31,319
getting root bound there's just an

396
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:32,730
insane amount of incredibly healthy root

397
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,740
material and see that's kind of what I

398
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:37,200
was pointing at is like if you're using

399
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:42,149
that would it be better to kind of

400
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:45,420
transplant more you know more often or

401
00:13:42,149 --> 00:13:47,039
just because we own a larger pot would

402
00:13:45,419 --> 00:13:48,599
have been helpful but it wasn't

403
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:50,129
necessary it wasn't to that point a

404
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,899
larger pot from the get-go

405
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:53,189
I wouldn't necessarily say transplanting

406
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:56,100
more frequently would be a good thing

407
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:58,500
there's a lot of stress yeah but you

408
00:13:56,100 --> 00:14:00,210
know we've gotten it down not to brag on

409
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,409
ourselves where you can transplant some

410
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:02,759
[ __ ] where there's like zero stress

411
00:14:01,409 --> 00:14:03,959
where the plants are even happier

412
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:05,730
they're like oh that was great

413
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:07,080
all right they asked you to stretch a

414
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:08,789
little more at the right yeah so once

415
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:12,060
you guys get comfortable I like to go

416
00:14:08,789 --> 00:14:13,769
myself I go from the cloner into a cup

417
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:15,239
actually I've been introduced to a new

418
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:16,829
product that I really like it's just

419
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,299
called a clone cup you can order them I

420
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:19,230
check them out on Instagram I don't

421
00:14:18,299 --> 00:14:21,329
order to order them they were kicked

422
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:22,980
down to me as a gift for a trial a trial

423
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:24,090
and I really like them they're harder

424
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:26,250
than a normal cup they're a little

425
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:28,350
bigger than a normal cup they're raised

426
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:29,549
a little and they've got holes where

427
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:31,050
they can drain a little bit better so

428
00:14:29,549 --> 00:14:31,889
the clone cup company I really like

429
00:14:31,049 --> 00:14:35,909
those if you guys

430
00:14:31,889 --> 00:14:37,859
and I could use like 90 of them be cool

431
00:14:35,909 --> 00:14:38,909
something let's read out follow colors

432
00:14:37,859 --> 00:14:40,559
were slipping yeah

433
00:14:38,909 --> 00:14:41,519
so I go well the solar cups you got to

434
00:14:40,558 --> 00:14:42,958
poke him yourself and they squeeze

435
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:44,639
together when you try to scoop dirt into

436
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:46,528
them these cups I'm saying that's hard

437
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,459
you can wash them and reuse them you

438
00:14:46,528 --> 00:14:50,249
don't have to keep going to Walmart

439
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:52,108
comes from home yeah you know so I go

440
00:14:50,249 --> 00:14:54,629
from the cloner into that cup and then I

441
00:14:52,109 --> 00:14:56,429
let it get kind of kind of close to

442
00:14:54,629 --> 00:14:57,688
rootbound in that cup but not I just

443
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:59,068
want to see the thick roots on the

444
00:14:57,688 --> 00:15:00,328
outside if I picked up the dirt I want

445
00:14:59,068 --> 00:15:02,068
to see roots but I don't let the plants

446
00:15:00,328 --> 00:15:04,048
start to stretch in there and then I go

447
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:05,998
to a three gallon and then sometimes if

448
00:15:04,048 --> 00:15:08,100
I'm doing like a breeding Fino hunt I'll

449
00:15:05,999 --> 00:15:09,449
run them in three all flower them out in

450
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:11,428
the three gallon when they're real short

451
00:15:09,448 --> 00:15:14,818
if I'm going bigger I'll throw them into

452
00:15:11,428 --> 00:15:16,168
a 7 gallon and flower mount in a 7 and I

453
00:15:14,818 --> 00:15:18,958
went the same amount of time I just

454
00:15:16,168 --> 00:15:20,818
added grow Kashi worm castings the

455
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:22,018
dragonfly Earth medicine root dust the

456
00:15:20,818 --> 00:15:25,618
black one I can't think of the name the

457
00:15:22,019 --> 00:15:27,328
battle's not over here just simple stuff

458
00:15:25,619 --> 00:15:30,629
like that and I did a little bit of fish

459
00:15:27,328 --> 00:15:33,178
Hydra slate and I've started to cut out

460
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:34,649
the OGT I'm not using OGT now dude my

461
00:15:33,178 --> 00:15:36,448
roots were huge yeah

462
00:15:34,649 --> 00:15:37,589
SuperDuper huge I could have used a

463
00:15:36,448 --> 00:15:40,139
bigger pot but I don't think it was

464
00:15:37,589 --> 00:15:41,669
necessary I think I did the right amount

465
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:43,769
of - they weren't root bound but the

466
00:15:41,668 --> 00:15:45,269
roots were spaghetti like I just know

467
00:15:43,769 --> 00:15:49,918
that since we've started using them

468
00:15:45,269 --> 00:15:52,860
having them in cups is almost like is it

469
00:15:49,918 --> 00:15:55,168
is it okay today is it okay today yeah

470
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:57,119
you know it's you're literally it you

471
00:15:55,168 --> 00:15:59,039
have to be on your stuff because if you

472
00:15:57,119 --> 00:16:01,980
leave them they're gonna Scotts way

473
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:04,558
quick and that's I mean regular plants

474
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:06,269
do but with the worm casting it is it's

475
00:16:04,558 --> 00:16:07,618
figure sad so I'm gonna go how to order

476
00:16:06,269 --> 00:16:09,178
a little bit I know I said I had a bunch

477
00:16:07,619 --> 00:16:10,860
of news but since we're talking about

478
00:16:09,178 --> 00:16:13,019
all this organic stuff another thing

479
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:15,360
that I've noticed that has really

480
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:18,418
contributed to the improvement in my

481
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:20,579
plants I use it in my bedroom I use it

482
00:16:18,418 --> 00:16:22,438
in my flowering room everything but the

483
00:16:20,578 --> 00:16:24,058
clones gets it the clones get it now as

484
00:16:22,438 --> 00:16:26,458
soon as they go into the dirt I feed at

485
00:16:24,058 --> 00:16:29,278
this Shawn gave me something called a

486
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:31,588
bow Kashi bucket the Bokashi bucket is

487
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:34,948
basically a five gallon bucket with a

488
00:16:31,589 --> 00:16:36,899
piece of piece of plastic as a catch or

489
00:16:34,948 --> 00:16:39,149
a shelf in there then that shelf has

490
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:41,668
holes in it and then underneath that

491
00:16:39,149 --> 00:16:43,798
shelf is a spigot and the idea is that

492
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:44,850
you throw we'll talk about more in a

493
00:16:43,798 --> 00:16:45,509
minute with more detail but you throw

494
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:47,339
your chute in there

495
00:16:45,509 --> 00:16:49,528
and it starts to get funky and then you

496
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:50,850
can turn the spigot and get the [ __ ] out

497
00:16:49,528 --> 00:16:53,278
is why that little shelf is in there you

498
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:56,189
get juice out of it juice juice nasty

499
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:59,639
it's like a miniature compost pile

500
00:16:56,188 --> 00:17:01,469
juicer okay so best way didn't set up

501
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:03,448
like a Gatorade great a great way

502
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:04,828
because I was going way I'm taking way a

503
00:17:03,448 --> 00:17:08,459
different way so you take the Bo Kashi

504
00:17:04,828 --> 00:17:10,048
bucket and when I got mine I put the

505
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:11,339
little shelf in there it's got a little

506
00:17:10,048 --> 00:17:12,778
shelf that you put down some of them

507
00:17:11,338 --> 00:17:14,338
have it pre affixed there's different

508
00:17:12,778 --> 00:17:15,298
models of the bucket that you get so

509
00:17:14,338 --> 00:17:17,428
there's a little shelf in there with

510
00:17:15,298 --> 00:17:19,828
holes in it I put down a thin layer of

511
00:17:17,429 --> 00:17:22,288
newspaper just one sheet of newspaper so

512
00:17:19,828 --> 00:17:24,418
that I made more of a screen and then I

513
00:17:22,288 --> 00:17:25,740
put a small layer of the Bo Kashi down

514
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:27,809
it comes with some powdered stuff called

515
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:30,000
bo khosh II I sprinkled about a handful

516
00:17:27,808 --> 00:17:32,250
of that on the screen and then what you

517
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,909
do is you just put I put I'm a

518
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:35,308
vegetarian

519
00:17:32,909 --> 00:17:37,350
and every banana that I eat has a banana

520
00:17:35,308 --> 00:17:39,778
peel every strawberry that I eat has

521
00:17:37,349 --> 00:17:41,519
that little the leafy part at the end of

522
00:17:39,778 --> 00:17:43,769
it there are some strawberries that come

523
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:45,538
in the package that are inedible every

524
00:17:43,769 --> 00:17:47,159
time you eat an onion the way I clean my

525
00:17:45,538 --> 00:17:49,138
onion is I chop each end off of the

526
00:17:47,159 --> 00:17:50,970
onion and then I can get that onion skin

527
00:17:49,138 --> 00:17:52,469
right off of it and so I've got an end

528
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:55,528
of each one or each end of it and the

529
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:58,019
onion skin and then I clean it that ends

530
00:17:55,528 --> 00:17:59,638
and the skin go into my little bowl and

531
00:17:58,019 --> 00:18:02,069
then once I've got this bowl filled I

532
00:17:59,638 --> 00:18:05,250
throw all my banana peels my eggshells

533
00:18:02,069 --> 00:18:07,589
my onion ends my carrots that got funky

534
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:09,750
the celery that I forgot around coffee

535
00:18:07,589 --> 00:18:11,369
grounds are you have to dry them set

536
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:13,319
them out and let them dry first if

537
00:18:11,369 --> 00:18:15,178
you're gonna do that but I do my yerba

538
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:17,038
mate' that I've cooked or that I've used

539
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:18,210
and my coffee grounds gotta set them on

540
00:18:17,038 --> 00:18:19,589
a paper towel and let them dry for like

541
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:22,528
48 hours you don't want to put too much

542
00:18:19,589 --> 00:18:23,970
moisture in there um I could explain why

543
00:18:22,528 --> 00:18:25,589
but it's too much to go in so anything

544
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:27,538
fruit or veggie what else can go in

545
00:18:25,589 --> 00:18:27,928
there you can put on meat and dairy in

546
00:18:27,538 --> 00:18:29,548
there

547
00:18:27,929 --> 00:18:31,470
kanya you can put your meat and dairy

548
00:18:29,548 --> 00:18:33,509
products and bread in there I choose not

549
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:35,399
to put I don't eat any meat or dairy and

550
00:18:33,509 --> 00:18:37,200
I only put a little bit of it'll be

551
00:18:35,398 --> 00:18:38,759
weird if your steaks cup or if your

552
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,110
plants got pork chops and steak and you

553
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:41,339
didn't right yeah yeah

554
00:18:40,109 --> 00:18:42,658
and that just doesn't even happen in

555
00:18:41,339 --> 00:18:44,459
this house there right no that comes

556
00:18:42,659 --> 00:18:45,510
here and I just put the vegetables in

557
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:47,610
the fruits and [ __ ] in there and

558
00:18:45,509 --> 00:18:50,460
although like some grapes and so there's

559
00:18:47,609 --> 00:18:53,250
apple cores and potato peels so you put

560
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:54,600
they say to put a two inch layer of food

561
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:56,339
waste in there and then sprinkle a

562
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:58,019
handful of the Bokashi and then another

563
00:18:56,339 --> 00:18:59,269
two-inch layer and sprinkle a handful of

564
00:18:58,019 --> 00:19:01,160
Bokashi

565
00:18:59,269 --> 00:19:03,019
to open it very often I throw all of my

566
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,610
scraps into a bowl and once the Bowl has

567
00:19:03,019 --> 00:19:06,470
starts to stink up the kitchen then I

568
00:19:04,609 --> 00:19:08,839
put that in the book ah she bucket right

569
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:09,289
uh Mike you've been here when I open the

570
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:11,659
bucket

571
00:19:09,289 --> 00:19:13,309
yeah I don't recommend going full work

572
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:15,980
and keeping it in your kitchen like some

573
00:19:13,309 --> 00:19:17,839
people but they're just don't open it up

574
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:20,480
- put this down when you pop the lid on

575
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:22,099
that sucker it is right it would where

576
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:25,690
you can smell the magic work we're

577
00:19:22,099 --> 00:19:29,599
fermenting banana peels apple cores

578
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:32,180
grapes there are eggshells in there uh

579
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:34,189
well there's avocados in there like

580
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:37,460
everything that juice that comes out of

581
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:38,720
the novels yeah so you keep putting your

582
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:40,700
keep packing your fruit and vegetables

583
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,170
in there or your food waste you can put

584
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:44,269
your bacon and eggs in there if you want

585
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:45,710
to all your food waste can go in there

586
00:19:44,269 --> 00:19:47,119
then you pack it down with this little

587
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:48,590
packer and keep sprinkling in the coffee

588
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:50,469
and then you seal it right and then

589
00:19:48,589 --> 00:19:53,000
after about it took me about ten days

590
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:54,440
about ten days you unscrew the spigot

591
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,410
that's on there and I put a mason jar

592
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:59,930
underneath it and this juice comes out

593
00:19:57,410 --> 00:20:03,740
and it starts off clear and kind of pink

594
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:05,750
or orange ish and it smells like oh it

595
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:07,759
is like the bar trash can they got

596
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:09,349
thrown up in and left in the Sun I feel

597
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:10,640
like it should be a game in the podcast

598
00:20:09,349 --> 00:20:12,619
you should just have the jar sitting

599
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:16,520
here and people dig what is this and you

600
00:20:12,619 --> 00:20:18,139
should just be I don't know the jar is

601
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:19,609
sitting you can see that I can see the

602
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:22,040
jar and I don't want no part of it I

603
00:20:19,609 --> 00:20:23,599
don't know this game is stuff that comes

604
00:20:22,039 --> 00:20:26,659
the juice that comes out of there I

605
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:29,089
throw that into a thing of clean water

606
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:31,400
with a bubbler and it bubbles up real

607
00:20:29,089 --> 00:20:33,259
good and it makes the stinkiest funky

608
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,910
[ __ ] and I feed that to my plants and I

609
00:20:33,259 --> 00:20:37,759
can see them dance around we have a

610
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:40,100
lantern AutoKey in our bucket yeah yeah

611
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:41,660
cuz these nutjobs a quick hole and just

612
00:20:40,099 --> 00:20:45,619
slide the tube through and just that's

613
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:48,170
the end of that story loop it's a the

614
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:50,179
plants love of people but good god it's

615
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:52,400
right yeah it is stinky it's definitely

616
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:54,410
sent a real delicate stomach ball kasha

617
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,600
so and not be for you but it's the

618
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:58,850
plants of loving it so more details I'll

619
00:20:56,599 --> 00:21:01,189
fill it up is almost to the top now I

620
00:20:58,849 --> 00:21:02,990
feel like I've got one more good dump of

621
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:04,940
my bowl of banana peeled ate a lot of

622
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:06,259
bananas you guys have a banana addiction

623
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:07,279
I think they're really good for me and

624
00:21:06,259 --> 00:21:08,210
they give me a lot of energy and they're

625
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:10,369
healthy and they're organic

626
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:11,000
even like a million ways I mean the [ __ ]

627
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:13,429
out of banana

628
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,230
so shout out some bananas but I've got

629
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:17,269
one more dump into there and then once I

630
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:18,740
dump that bowl into there I'm out of

631
00:21:17,269 --> 00:21:20,240
coffee so I won't even be able to put

632
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:22,400
more Kosh in there I'll seal it and let

633
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,039
it seal for about 14 days and everything

634
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,480
that's in there is essentially pickling

635
00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:28,250
it's like fermenting and pickling in

636
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,809
there and I'll pull out juice out of

637
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:32,509
there I'll get a lot of that I call it

638
00:21:29,809 --> 00:21:35,210
Kashi juice I'll probably get five six

639
00:21:32,509 --> 00:21:36,529
maybe eight to ten depending on how I

640
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:38,660
don't know how soggy the top layer is

641
00:21:36,529 --> 00:21:40,700
gonna get I'll get eight to ten jars

642
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:44,150
hopefully of that Kashi juice out of

643
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:48,230
there and then I will take two large

worm castings - I just love it it's

660
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:25,130
worth there won't be any worm castings

661
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:26,750
in there just yet but in the future

662
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:29,780
there will be castings out of that same

663
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:32,089
soil yes indeed yes and that soil will

664
00:22:29,779 --> 00:22:34,490
get that'll just be the base like we'll

665
00:22:32,089 --> 00:22:36,500
only need a little bit of that soil per

666
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:38,329
the regular soil mixing bin we'll just

667
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:40,039
cut it down yeah and it'll make some

668
00:22:38,329 --> 00:22:42,409
dank soil there'd be a lot of microbes

669
00:22:40,039 --> 00:22:48,079
in there new yeah Mike does not look

670
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:50,930

plants there are other things that we

679
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:08,660
still have to supplement and stuff but

680
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:10,910
my roots are amazing I'm super impressed

681
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:14,240
and I'm making my own [ __ ] I can make

682
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:18,740
with a handful of worm castings with one

683
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:20,420
jar of that Kashi tea with 15 scoops of

684
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:22,009

00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:22,460
10 scoops of grow Kashi there's never

686
00:23:22,009 --> 00:23:26,028

687
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:27,499

molasses it's like just like five ounces

690
00:23:29,898 --> 00:23:34,128
if you don't want to use molasses you

691
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:35,899
don't need it but you could make I made

692
00:23:34,128 --> 00:23:38,028

about ladybugs I'm way distracted yes

805
00:27:20,269 --> 00:27:22,519
and I feel like I had a head injury

806
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:24,380
again yeah

807
00:27:22,519 --> 00:27:26,058
so this dude he asked me not to say his

808
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:27,320
name there's parts of this email that I

809
00:27:26,058 --> 00:27:29,778
won't read because some of it was just

810
00:27:27,319 --> 00:27:31,579
for me but he opens with first of all

811
00:27:29,778 --> 00:27:33,440
thanks for the awesome pod love years

812
00:27:31,579 --> 00:27:35,569
style and mystic roots were a perfect

813
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,980
fit for bed music you're welcome to read

814
00:27:35,569 --> 00:27:39,288
this on the pod but please don't mention

815
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:42,349
my real name just used vape dad on

816
00:27:39,288 --> 00:27:44,450
reddit very active in our slash trees

817
00:27:42,349 --> 00:27:46,209
then he talked about his soil where he

818
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:47,799
is and then he says

819
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:49,090
I was reading a book called cannabis

820
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:50,109
cultivation the other day at Barnes &amp;

821
00:27:49,089 --> 00:27:52,750
Noble and they recommended putting

822
00:27:50,109 --> 00:27:54,099
ladybugs in our greenhouse to fight a

823
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:55,420
feeds and caterpillars and a whole

824
00:27:54,099 --> 00:27:57,669
assortment of pests

825
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:59,500
so in researching organic growing for no

826
00:27:57,670 --> 00:28:02,560
other reason than I like the all-natural

827
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:03,849
aspect of it thinking thinking like this

828
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:06,519
I was wondering would it be a good idea

829
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:06,819
to raise loose ladybugs in your grow

830
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:08,379
room

831
00:28:06,819 --> 00:28:10,470
what could they hurt in the stages of

832
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:13,120
growth if anything or could these be

833
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:15,460
Nature's pest control for those aspiring

834
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:17,169
to care give this may be a dumb question

835
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:19,000
but I just wanted to ask a live person

836
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:21,100
with some real quantifiable growing

837
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,109
experience again thanks for the pot and

838
00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:25,719
keep it up it's a really beautiful thing

839
00:28:23,109 --> 00:28:27,939

840
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:29,860

00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:41,160

I got there I don't know what I would do

862
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:12,039
I'd be super stoked to do it just sit

863
00:29:10,119 --> 00:29:14,109
there in grid into the mud that's

864
00:29:12,039 --> 00:29:16,869
probably what I would do I'd love to be

865
00:29:14,109 --> 00:29:21,429
on that show with Ari and Joey Diaz and

866
00:29:16,869 --> 00:29:25,629
Joe Rogan I'd be the hate the hate that

867
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:28,450
come from the head oh man [ __ ] you

868
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:29,980
haters but I'd love to be on that mom so

869
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:32,140
let's get to the point here and dude you

870
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:33,700
said this may be a dumb question no dumb

871
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:35,980
questions bro never no dumb questions

872
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:37,660
Dom you've got to start somewhere I had

873
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:39,130
training wheels at one point and now I'm

874
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:41,100
doing wheelies and you just got to start

875
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:43,510
somewhere there are no dumb questions um

876
00:29:41,099 --> 00:29:45,639
my theory on ladybugs and Michael

877
00:29:43,509 --> 00:29:47,529
probably back me up on this a long time

878
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:48,700
ago I did what I thought was cute and I

879
00:29:47,529 --> 00:29:50,470
went to the hydro store and I bought a

880
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:51,880
thousand ladybugs yeah I've been

881
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:53,079
thinking about your experiment while you

882
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:54,550
were reading the email opened up the

883
00:29:53,079 --> 00:29:54,990
container and let them fly about the

884
00:29:54,549 --> 00:29:57,269
Grove

885
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:59,009
they were cute I got out the camera and

886
00:29:57,269 --> 00:30:01,319
took pictures of ladybugs [ __ ] on my

887
00:29:59,009 --> 00:30:02,369
plants and she's really cool yep it

888
00:30:01,319 --> 00:30:04,619
didn't it see Adams

889
00:30:02,369 --> 00:30:06,809
yep they've been there they sell 300

890
00:30:04,619 --> 00:30:08,939
thorns so I went out and then the next

891
00:30:06,809 --> 00:30:11,190
day I released what was it 1,500

892
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:13,230
something of it yeah it looked like the

893
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:15,180
envelope the t-shirt from Amazon shows

894
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:17,339
up yeah you just open that [ __ ] and

895
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:19,019
don't so the next morning I find if I

896
00:30:17,339 --> 00:30:20,909
released 1500 of them the next morning

897
00:30:19,019 --> 00:30:23,129
there were 50 alive in that [ __ ] uh

898
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:25,230
they find all your fans they fly up into

899
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:27,750
your lights yep so here's something that

900
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:29,190
Sean taught me uh credit to Sean king

901
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:30,779
Cola he taught me this and I'm gonna

902
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:35,549
butcher it because I had a head injury

903
00:30:30,779 --> 00:30:37,920
that night ladybugs don't see in the

904
00:30:35,549 --> 00:30:39,930
same spectrum as humans ladybugs see a

905
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:42,269
UV spectrum that it's only provided by

906
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:44,700
the light so when we take a ladybug and

907
00:30:42,269 --> 00:30:46,410
we put it in a grow room all it sees is

908
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:48,420
a grow light and it all it doesn't see

909
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:50,279
it it's confused now and it wants to get

910
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:52,050
toward the light that it can see and

911
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:53,609
it's warm the warmth and so it flies

912
00:30:52,049 --> 00:30:55,139
into your hoods it flies into your fans

913
00:30:53,609 --> 00:30:59,539
and you get to sweep them all up and

914
00:30:55,140 --> 00:31:02,160
they smell terrible yeah I spent months

915
00:30:59,539 --> 00:31:03,899
cleaning lady bugs out of every little

916
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:05,610
corner and looking cranny in that

917
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:08,580
[ __ ] Grove and then you'd find him in

918
00:31:05,609 --> 00:31:11,369
weird places randomly - and they didn't

919
00:31:08,579 --> 00:31:14,369
do much there are predatory mites that

920
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:16,409
are worth it their work indoors but I

921
00:31:14,369 --> 00:31:18,299
don't think that ladybugs uh praying

922
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:20,340
mantis or cool indoors they don't run

923
00:31:18,299 --> 00:31:21,899
away and ladybugs are also hard to find

924
00:31:20,339 --> 00:31:23,279
migratory creatures they want to take

925
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:24,840
off they don't want to be there they

926
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:26,190
want to go and they want to fly away and

927
00:31:24,839 --> 00:31:29,730
they want to eat and they want to fly

928
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:31,890
away yeah so in my honest opinion I

929
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:33,299
would say no on the ladybugs in an

930
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:35,310
indoor situation if you have a

931
00:31:33,299 --> 00:31:36,869
greenhouse or an outdoor situation and

932
00:31:35,309 --> 00:31:38,009
you're ready to keep you're gonna have

933
00:31:36,869 --> 00:31:39,899
to keep adding to them and you're also

934
00:31:38,009 --> 00:31:42,240
going to have to feed them they do

935
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:43,920
require food even if there are a fins

936
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:46,170
and [ __ ] they're like you don't want to

937
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:47,460
eat hummus and falafel all day you need

938
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:49,650
to change so you got to provide them

939
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:50,519
some kind of food so keep that in mind

940
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:51,960
if you're going to use them in an

941
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:54,509
outdoor or greenhouse situation but

942
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:56,549
indoors I would not do the ladybugs and

943
00:31:54,509 --> 00:31:59,369
then that food could also bring other

944
00:31:56,549 --> 00:32:01,139
pests that's very likely very likely at

945
00:31:59,369 --> 00:32:03,839
this point I tell people to release them

946
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:06,180
around their to their Gro not in their

947
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:06,980
grow room at this point so like sprinkle

948
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:09,200
them in the front and back

949
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:11,240
yard it don't bother with them otherwise

950
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:13,190
just as like an extra preventive measure

951
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:14,720
and the thing about the Mantis is I've

952
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:16,940
been in a few pet stores here in

953
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:20,029
Colorado like you guys carry mantas and

954
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:21,679
I'm expecting to like see a whole we you

955
00:32:20,029 --> 00:32:24,678
know fish tank full of mantises and like

956
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:26,150
y'all take 30 of them it's it's funny

957
00:32:24,679 --> 00:32:27,259
you got a room you gotta order them but

958
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:30,110
they'll send you eggs and then you gotta

959
00:32:27,259 --> 00:32:32,269
let the eggs hatch yeah yeah yeah

960
00:32:30,109 --> 00:32:35,779
there's a website I think you have Toto

961
00:32:32,269 --> 00:32:38,000
calm ARB ico calm go there are Bicol

962

963
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,450
great [ __ ] they'll send you bugs they'll

964
00:32:39,349 --> 00:32:43,039
send you nematodes some of it is

965
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:45,319
seasonal so you might not be able to get

966
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:47,089
everything but organic pest control at

967
00:32:45,319 --> 00:32:48,889
its finest they don't pay me to say that

968
00:32:47,089 --> 00:32:51,500
I just like sharing useful [ __ ] with

969
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:53,480
people we've been gone 32 minutes I'd

970
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:55,308
like to go about 45 maybe an hour at the

971
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:57,200

972
00:32:55,308 --> 00:33:00,379
articles so you guys want to get into

973
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:03,590
the news I do but we can make a teacher

974
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:04,850
so the next dad though you thinking so I

975
00:33:03,589 --> 00:33:06,949
kind of agree with you I like the way

976
00:33:04,849 --> 00:33:08,569
Mike thinks my his on I'm gonna take a

977
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:11,779
drink here um we're gonna dab some

978
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:13,189
lemonade from Terp ex I think was it

979
00:33:11,779 --> 00:33:15,319
John John that recommended this to us

980
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:17,210
lutely all right I'm gonna somebody talk

981
00:33:15,319 --> 00:33:19,609
for a second he did uh when I was down

982
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:21,919
there he didn't he had not had a sample

983
00:33:19,609 --> 00:33:23,659
of the review yet so he couldn't really

984
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:26,870
give me an honest opinion but the name

985
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:28,820
was enticing but names can be misleading

986
00:33:26,869 --> 00:33:32,959
sometimes we all know about the name

987
00:33:28,819 --> 00:33:35,480
game okay uh yeah so it was interesting

988
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:37,730
hearing about where the handkerchief

989
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:39,440
came from and that was deficit I'm a

990
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:40,669

991
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,380
pretty [ __ ] funny story because I

992
00:33:40,669 --> 00:33:44,120

993
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:46,309

994
00:33:44,119 --> 00:33:47,719

it says I'm going to choke here in a

1123
00:38:13,969 --> 00:38:17,599
second cuz I took a huge dab but just

1124
00:38:15,349 --> 00:38:19,190
bear with me 6 marijuana grows in Denver

1125
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:21,229
were ordered to quarantine possibly

1126
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:22,759
destroy plant harvest after Denver Fire

1127
00:38:21,228 --> 00:38:24,348
Department officials determined that the

1128
00:38:22,759 --> 00:38:25,139
grow facilities weren't using chemicals

1129
00:38:24,349 --> 00:38:28,480
properly

1130
00:38:25,139 --> 00:38:28,480
[Music]

1131
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:34,369
i traits are not the lab the harder I

1132
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:36,349
tried Nazi the worse it was Mike just

1133
00:38:34,369 --> 00:38:38,358
moved away from the microphone his knees

1134
00:38:36,349 --> 00:38:41,809
but head-butted the mic stand with his

1135
00:38:38,358 --> 00:38:44,029
knees now [ __ ] glorious just a little

1136
00:38:41,809 --> 00:38:46,940
head but I wish there was video for that

1137
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:48,710
alright so they're not using chemicals

1138
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:50,059
properly bugs and pass for a fact of

1139
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:51,829
life for commercial growers but dealing

1140
00:38:50,059 --> 00:38:53,779
with them appropriately is important

1141
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:55,940
because eventually humans will consume

1142
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:57,470
the pot earlier this month the city of

1143
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:59,119
Denver released a bulletin warning grows

1144
00:38:57,469 --> 00:39:01,099
our warning grows about the improper use

1145
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:02,570
of pesticides because the fire

1146
00:39:01,099 --> 00:39:04,309
department's recent discovery the city

1147
00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:06,859
has ordered all licensed pot grows in

1148
00:39:04,309 --> 00:39:09,619
the city to send in pesticide reports by

1149
00:39:06,858 --> 00:39:11,029
April first pesticides and agricultural

1150
00:39:09,619 --> 00:39:12,769
chemicals must be used in accordance

1151
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:14,780
with the product label and with all

1152
00:39:12,769 --> 00:39:17,150
applicable federal state and local laws

1153
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:18,800
and regulations improper use of

1154
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:20,358
pesticides on marijuana can raise

1155
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,820
serious public health concerns the

1156
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:24,529
bulletin reads the catch is that the

1157
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:26,030
federal agency in charge of regulating

1158
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:27,290
pesticide use the Environmental

1159
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,970
Protection Agency doesn't have

1160
00:39:27,289 --> 00:39:30,920
acceptable levels for use on cannabis

1161
00:39:28,969 --> 00:39:33,079
since cannabis is illegal on a federal

1162
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:35,030
level the Colorado Department of

1163
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:36,769
Agriculture lacks official guidelines to

1164
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:38,060
beyond suggesting that growers not use

1165
00:39:36,769 --> 00:39:40,579
any pesticides that haven't been

1166
00:39:38,059 --> 00:39:43,210
specifically tested labeled and assigned

1167
00:39:40,579 --> 00:39:45,079
to set tolerance for pot growing now

1168
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:46,730
anybody that's listened to this podcast

1169
00:39:45,079 --> 00:39:48,559
for more than three or four episodes

1170
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:50,300
already knows what my solution to part

1171
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:51,409
of this problem is the environmental

1172
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:53,000
protection agency does not have

1173
00:39:51,409 --> 00:39:54,679
acceptable levels for use on cannabis

1174
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:57,500
since cannabis is illegal on a federal

1175
00:39:54,679 --> 00:40:01,909
level let's think about this solution

1176
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:03,889
anybody legalize cannabis yes see that's

1177
00:40:01,909 --> 00:40:05,989
your first step that will make this a

1178
00:40:03,889 --> 00:40:09,379
little bit easier it with legalization

1179
00:40:05,989 --> 00:40:11,329
comes product safety people all right Oh

1180
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:12,858
more was that the CDA does have an

1181
00:40:11,329 --> 00:40:14,630
unofficial list of pesticides that can

1182
00:40:12,858 --> 00:40:15,980
be used on unspecified crops that are

1183
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:18,470
intended for human consumption however

1184
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:19,849
Oh consumption however I kind of read

1185
00:40:18,469 --> 00:40:21,169
that weird my fault and the state

1186
00:40:19,849 --> 00:40:22,849
marijuana Enforcement Division has a

1187
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:24,740
strict list of allowed pesticides as

1188
00:40:22,849 --> 00:40:27,230
well as instructions for how grow owners

1189
00:40:24,739 --> 00:40:28,939
have to store and dispose of them state

1190
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:30,858
law also requires that shops write up

1191
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:33,409
standard operating operating procedures

1192
00:40:30,858 --> 00:40:35,389
for all pesticide applications in Denver

1193
00:40:33,409 --> 00:40:37,429
dispensaries will now be required to

1194
00:40:35,389 --> 00:40:38,829
submit a list of every pesticide used

1195
00:40:37,429 --> 00:40:41,259
and how much of it

1196
00:40:38,829 --> 00:40:42,670
is used copies of those records must be

1197
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:43,600
kept in the facility where the marijuana

1198
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:45,340
has grown

1199
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:46,960
additionally grows must send lists of

1200
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:49,180
pesticides and information on their

1201
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:51,849
safety to the Denver Fire Department and

1202
00:40:49,179 --> 00:40:53,710
a sign must be placed on the door of

1203
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:56,170
every grill room listing any and all

1204
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:58,570
pesticides used those businesses that

1205
00:40:56,170 --> 00:41:01,180
don't comply could faced fine could face

1206

1218
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:27,519
seen it happen to another place when

1219
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:29,289
people don't get the the amount of

1220
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:32,079
regulation and oversight that this

1221
00:41:29,289 --> 00:41:34,179
industry operates on remedy is massive

1222
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:36,730
yeah when I'm hanging out near the bud

1223

room I'll hear people it's been a long

1224
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:39,400
time since anyone said it but you'll

1225
00:41:38,050 --> 00:41:40,930

fan's what the hell okay I want to get

1243
00:42:15,159 --> 00:42:18,639
more into this article it says the city

1244
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:20,260
also says that the Denver Department of

1245
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:22,150
Public Health and Environment will be

1246
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:25,450
inspecting cultivation sites as well as

1247
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:27,039
infused product manufacturing sites so

1248
00:42:25,449 --> 00:42:28,960
what was happening you guys you heard

1249
00:42:27,039 --> 00:42:30,429
the article there were some shops in

1250
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:32,470
Denver some grows in Denver that were

1251
00:42:30,429 --> 00:42:35,469
using chemicals that should not have

1252
00:42:32,469 --> 00:42:37,719
been being used on the cannabis that

1253
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:39,730
they were selling to the public and it's

1254
00:42:37,719 --> 00:42:43,000
my bad that the shops that were busting

1255
00:42:39,730 --> 00:42:45,429
out those $75 and $99 ounces it's

1256
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:48,340
probably those guys probably their

1257
00:42:45,429 --> 00:42:49,809
decision bonds on the phone yeah yeah

1258
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:50,950
the ones that you see in the back of the

1259
00:42:49,809 --> 00:42:53,019
magazines and stuff you

1260
00:42:50,949 --> 00:42:54,669
those are man that's terrible that

1261
00:42:53,019 --> 00:42:56,588
they're doing that and there's a pit the

1262
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:59,440
picture of this article makes it the

1263
00:42:56,588 --> 00:43:01,389
best there is a picture of a guy in like

1264
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:04,510
a Breaking Bad suit with the full-on gas

1265
00:43:01,389 --> 00:43:06,848
mask toting weed out is pouring a bottle

1266
00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:09,099
of monsanto chemicals into another

1267
00:43:06,849 --> 00:43:10,900
container and it's completely unrelated

1268
00:43:09,099 --> 00:43:13,210
to anything to do with the article it's

1269
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:14,858
just a period I picture is all it is and

1270
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:15,970
what I'll turn the computer this way you

1271
00:43:14,858 --> 00:43:17,650
gotta lean this way I've got too many

1272
00:43:15,969 --> 00:43:20,289
things plugged in but look at this [ __ ]

1273
00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:22,480
full-on Breaking Bad suit chemical into

1274
00:43:20,289 --> 00:43:25,029
chemical nothing to do with cannabis or

1275
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:26,559
this article it looks like glue it looks

1276
00:43:25,030 --> 00:43:27,760
like he's pouring glue well Eagle 20

1277
00:43:26,559 --> 00:43:29,858
looks like that if you've ever seen

1278
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:31,570
Eagle 20 and I kind of assumed we talked

1279
00:43:29,858 --> 00:43:32,920
about it friends and I Eagle 20 was

1280
00:43:31,570 --> 00:43:35,260
probably one of the products being used

1281
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:37,680
in all of this [ __ ] if I read it

1282
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:41,349
right the shops that have their crops

1283

00:46:09,010 --> 00:46:16,570
legislature have approved this

1355
00:46:10,570 --> 00:46:19,960
legislation what's so funny bro that

1356
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:22,180
Mountain Dew was a big yeah power to it

1357
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:23,889
he held that far from the mics and it

1358
00:46:22,179 --> 00:46:24,429
was still like a shotgun in my ears that

1359
00:46:23,889 --> 00:46:25,960
was good

1360
00:46:24,429 --> 00:46:28,719
I know people from the south bill that's

1361
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:30,250
a good kind of mountain dude when a beer

1362
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:32,019
opens like that it's like that's a good

1363
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:33,460
can of bearish gonna be a good kind of

1364
00:46:32,019 --> 00:46:34,900
beer right here that's one of them

1365
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:36,909
special Mountain Dews and I think I'm

1366
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:38,470
thinking Mountain Dew yeah see it's been

1367
00:46:36,909 --> 00:46:40,210
over a year since I've had Mountain Dew

1368
00:46:38,469 --> 00:46:42,099
I think yeah that's probably since I was

1369
00:46:40,210 --> 00:46:43,659
16 I was like getting off crack though

1370
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:45,489
my body went through a withdrawal for a

1371
00:46:43,659 --> 00:46:47,349
minute there I've heard the regular do

1372
00:46:45,489 --> 00:46:49,929
and the faux do at home just in case I

1373
00:46:47,349 --> 00:46:51,429
run out of the regular yeah he does make

1374
00:46:49,929 --> 00:46:54,000
his own he's got the little fizz machine

1375
00:46:51,429 --> 00:46:56,379
so in a victory for religious freedom

1376
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,239
adherence to the homegrown Rastafari

1377
00:46:56,380 --> 00:47:00,250
spiritual movement can now freely use

1378
00:46:58,239 --> 00:47:02,319
marijuana for sacramental purposes for

1379
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:03,730
the first time on the tropical land yes

1380
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:05,650
I Rastafari

1381
00:47:03,730 --> 00:47:07,329
the law makes possession of up to two

1382
00:47:05,650 --> 00:47:08,980
ounces of marijuana a petty offense that

1383
00:47:07,329 --> 00:47:11,230
could result in a ticket but not a

1384
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:14,880
criminal record cultivation of that

1385
00:47:11,230 --> 00:47:14,880
don't sound legal what might

1386
00:47:16,309 --> 00:47:21,389
I like that well they've got medical

1387
00:47:19,230 --> 00:47:23,130
marijuana now and dude before if you got

1388
00:47:21,389 --> 00:47:25,920
call of cannabis in Jamaica know for

1389
00:47:23,130 --> 00:47:27,329
sure days in a Jamaican jail and seven

1390
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:29,940
days in a Jamaican jail I'd probably

1391
00:47:27,329 --> 00:47:31,980
rather take 45 days in a Pueblo jail to

1392
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:33,960
tell you the truth like it's not gonna

1393
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:35,639
be anything fun you sleep on the cement

1394
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:40,019

1396
00:47:40,019 --> 00:47:43,920

1397
00:47:42,449 --> 00:47:46,829
offense you don't go to jail that's way

1398
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:49,800
better five or fewer plants on any

1399
00:47:46,829 --> 00:47:52,289
premises would be permitted it'll be

1400
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:54,180
five ganja plants now a tourists who are

1401
00:47:52,289 --> 00:47:55,739

1402
00:47:54,179 --> 00:47:57,719
soon be able to apply for permits

1403
00:47:55,739 --> 00:47:59,909

1404
00:47:57,719 --> 00:48:03,019
amounts of Jamaican wheat or ganja as it

1405
00:47:59,909 --> 00:48:05,219
is known locally that's [ __ ] brilliant

1406
00:48:03,019 --> 00:48:08,190
marketing on behalf of the government

1408
00:48:08,190 --> 00:48:11,789

security minister said the legislation

1430
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:59,639
does not mean Jamaica plans to soften it

1431
00:48:56,849 --> 00:49:02,159
stands on transnational drug trafficking

1432

largest supplier of pot to the US and

regional islands the passage of this

1436
00:49:08,219 --> 00:49:11,669

00:49:09,539 --> 00:49:14,190
free-for-all in the growing transporting

1438

trafficking of marijuana into the US

answer that does any sense at all truth

1467
00:50:13,230 --> 00:50:18,240
what we need to do is buy a small plane

1468
00:50:15,030 --> 00:50:21,599
at first then we fly people straight

1469

middle floor

1472
00:50:24,690 --> 00:50:27,960

frequently stopped I'm telling you now

Colorado Jamaica why this is we've legal

1480
00:50:40,858 --> 00:50:46,139
both uh so anyway debated debate has

1481
00:50:44,429 --> 00:50:47,789
long raged in Jamaica over relaxing laws

1482
00:50:46,139 --> 00:50:49,348
prohibiting ganja but previous calls to

1483
00:50:47,789 --> 00:50:51,029
decriminalize small amounts of marijuana

1484
00:50:49,349 --> 00:50:52,410
fizzled out because officials feared

1485
00:50:51,030 --> 00:50:55,260
they would bring sanctions from

1486
00:50:52,409 --> 00:50:56,730
Washington Jamaican officials now have

1487
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:59,400
high hopes that the island can become a

1488
00:50:56,730 --> 00:51:01,108

00:51:05,429 --> 00:51:09,269
history of creating marijuana derived

1493
00:51:07,019 --> 00:51:10,650
products such as kennesaw which helps

1494
00:51:09,269 --> 00:51:14,338
relieve pressure in the eyes of

1495

hi Alton said the cannabis industry

1516
00:51:53,329 --> 00:51:56,779
holds great potential for Jamaica where

1517
00:51:55,039 --> 00:51:59,150
marijuana has long been grown illegally

1518
00:51:56,780 --> 00:52:00,619
on mountainsides and marshes the move by

1519
00:51:59,150 --> 00:52:01,760
Jamaican lawmakers adds to an

1520
00:52:00,619 --> 00:52:03,440
international trend of easing

allow some form of medical marijuana and

1524
00:52:08,090 --> 00:52:13,039
last year Colorado and Washington

1525
00:52:09,829 --> 00:52:14,809
legalized personal use on Tuesday Alaska

1526
00:52:13,039 --> 00:52:16,429

00:52:27,199 --> 00:52:31,099
2009 Supreme Court ruling that jail time

1534
00:52:29,449 --> 00:52:33,289
for small amounts of drugs violates the

1535
00:52:31,099 --> 00:52:33,679
country's constitution that's [ __ ]

1536

00:52:39,949 --> 00:52:44,358

1541
00:52:42,170 --> 00:52:46,070
in upcoming months but for now Jamaican

1542

cannabis Crusaders applauded the

1543
00:52:46,070 --> 00:52:49,609
amendments this is a big step in the

1544
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:51,800
right direction but there's still a lot

1545

00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:14,239
to fifteen bucks or whatever to be able

1554
00:53:12,739 --> 00:53:15,079

1555
00:53:14,239 --> 00:53:16,489
worry about it while they're there

1556
00:53:15,079 --> 00:53:17,989
