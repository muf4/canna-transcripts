news articles I want to talk about

70
00:02:37,469 --> 00:02:43,289
something that I watched this weekend I

71
00:02:40,289 --> 00:02:45,689
didn't get to go but I definitely jumped

72
00:02:43,289 --> 00:02:48,358
on the internet and saw some replays the

73
00:02:45,689 --> 00:02:50,699
Grateful Dead did some shows in Santa

74
00:02:48,359 --> 00:02:52,260
Clara this weekend anybody that knows me

75
00:02:50,699 --> 00:02:53,909
knows that I'm a huge Grateful Dead fan

76
00:02:52,259 --> 00:02:56,759
the Grateful Dead has a lot to do with

77
00:02:53,909 --> 00:03:00,060
who I am and why I am Who I am and what

78
00:02:56,759 --> 00:03:01,649
I am ah I've been a Grateful Dead fan

79
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:04,259
I've been at Jerry Garcia fan I'm in a

80
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:06,810
jam rock fan since the early 90s

81
00:03:04,259 --> 00:03:10,229
probably 93 now I'm going to say 95 cuz

82
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:11,909
I moved here late 94 early 94 or

83
00:03:10,229 --> 00:03:14,519
whatever anyway my first

84
00:03:11,909 --> 00:03:16,859
Phish show was 69.95 so I've been

85
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:19,620
listening to the dead fish all of that

86
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:22,200
stuff heavily heavily since 95 I did a

87
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:24,060
whole bunch of fish shows I mean my best

88
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:26,339
friend Rob the dude did a whole bunch of

89
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:29,520
widespread panic shows one summer summer

90
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:30,270
tour 2001 we did about 20 shows that was

91
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,850
pretty epic

92
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:35,430
so the Grateful Dead is a huge part of

93
00:03:32,849 --> 00:03:39,509
why I am Who I am I learned a lot of

94
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:41,490
things on Phish tour a lot and further

95
00:03:39,509 --> 00:03:44,099
festival parking lots and what-have-you

96
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:45,480
so I watched these uh so the Grateful

97
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:47,280
Dead got back together and of course

98
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:48,959
Jerry Garcia is no longer with us he's

99
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,599
been gone for several years now

100
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:54,870
so filling in Jerry's shoes was trey

101
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:57,269
from fish which you would think that's

102
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:59,939
like most of fish and Grateful Dead fans

103
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:02,100
biggest wet dream but it almost it was

104
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:03,449
so overhyped and so big that it just

105
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:05,489
seemed weird to me it seemed like a big

106
00:04:03,449 --> 00:04:07,859
commercial thing it seemed right Trey

107
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:09,719
was the dude to choose but it was almost

108
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:11,580
it put up so much hype and so much

109
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:14,129
expectation it's so much pressure that

110
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:16,259
it was just weird so watching the I

111
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:17,670
didn't I didn't go to the shows I should

112
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:18,810
have gone but that was it's hella

113
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:20,459
expensive if I got a lot of

114
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:21,720
responsibilities I didn't feel like

115
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:24,810
you'd be right to go take a week off to

116
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:27,419
go to some shows right now but I did

117
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:29,790
watch them online it's the first two

118
00:04:27,418 --> 00:04:31,199
shows that they've done these guys have

119
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:32,370
never done a show together so the first

120
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,719
two shows they've done in public and

121
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:36,180
they've got three more shows coming up

122
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:38,699
over the fourth of July weekend

123
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:41,579
I was totally satisfied with what I saw

124
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:42,990
but it seemed really weird watching it

125
00:04:41,579 --> 00:04:45,959
it was like watching a Grateful Dead

126
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:48,569
cover band do Grateful Dead songs they

127
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:51,538
didn't feel natural they didn't flow

128
00:04:48,569 --> 00:04:53,310
something wasn't meshing there's not a

129
00:04:51,538 --> 00:04:55,889
leader to that band is something that I

130
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:59,430
think I noticed that band doesn't have a

131
00:04:55,889 --> 00:05:00,960
solid leader Bobby's trying to lead the

132
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:02,819
band but it doesn't seem like he's able

133
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:06,629
to get control because no one wants to

134
00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:08,759
listen to him ah tre seems timid he

135
00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:11,098
doesn't want to let loose and solo like

136
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:12,300
he should but by the end of the second

137
00:05:11,098 --> 00:05:13,620
show it felt like everything was right

138
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:15,240
but that was the end of the second show

139
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:17,668
and that was the end of the weekend and

140
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,590
everything was wrapping up so I'm hoping

141
00:05:17,668 --> 00:05:21,719
that by the time they get to the Chicago

142
00:05:19,589 --> 00:05:23,638
venue by the time this show comes out

143
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:26,009
they will be in Chicago and they will be

144
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:27,150
setting up they may have already even

145
00:05:26,009 --> 00:05:28,439
played I'm not sure if this will come

146
00:05:27,149 --> 00:05:30,810
out on Thursday or Monday we'll see how

147
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:31,709
things go but I hope I can get it out

148
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:34,470
for you by Thursday

149
00:05:31,709 --> 00:05:35,758
so yeah the Grateful Dead they've got

150
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:37,470
some improvement to do hopefully they

151
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,879
talked about what didn't work while

152
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:40,830
they're on the road and then they

153
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:42,449
figured out by the weekend I'm thinking

154
00:05:40,829 --> 00:05:44,189
that they saved up the better songs that

155
00:05:42,449 --> 00:05:46,199
they practiced for I'm not saying the

156
00:05:44,189 --> 00:05:48,120
setlist over this weekend wasn't amazing

157
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:49,590
all of the songs were great but I'm

158
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:52,500
hoping that they saved up some of the

159
00:05:49,589 --> 00:05:55,879
more Trey didn't sing but for one song

160
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:58,589
this whole weekend so I'm hoping they

161
00:05:55,879 --> 00:06:00,478
got more trey songz lined up for the

162
00:05:58,589 --> 00:06:02,069
Chicago shows I'm hoping that we get to

163
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:04,829
hear Terrapin station with Trey on

164
00:06:02,069 --> 00:06:07,288
vocals there are several that I would

165
00:06:04,829 --> 00:06:08,788
like to hear Tracy so I'm probably

166
00:06:07,288 --> 00:06:10,889
boring the hell out of a lot of my fans

167
00:06:08,788 --> 00:06:12,449
with my Grateful Dead talk a lot of the

168
00:06:10,889 --> 00:06:13,889
people listening but grateful that's a

169
00:06:12,449 --> 00:06:16,079
big part of who I am so I really wanted

170
00:06:13,889 --> 00:06:18,569
to talk about that that's Grateful Dead

171
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:20,189
they're going to Chicago over the fourth

172
00:06:18,569 --> 00:06:21,709
of July weekend check that [ __ ] out

173
00:06:20,189 --> 00:06:25,439
that'll be really neat

174
00:06:21,709 --> 00:06:28,049
so my next topic I have a friend named

175
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:30,478
his name is Tim and he actually has a

176
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:33,210
company that sells a product called a

177
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:34,829
torch list nail and is a torch list dab

178
00:06:33,209 --> 00:06:37,769
nail and I've been very curious about

179
00:06:34,829 --> 00:06:39,569
this product so Tim was passing through

180
00:06:37,769 --> 00:06:41,339
Tim does not live in Colorado he lives

181
00:06:39,569 --> 00:06:43,709
in another state but he was passing

182
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:45,388
through my town and he was kind enough

183
00:06:43,709 --> 00:06:46,859
I always in Tim if you're passing

184
00:06:45,389 --> 00:06:48,230
through dude you're always invited here

185
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:49,639
to come take some dabs at my house

186
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:51,350
even if you don't have cool toys with

187
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:53,599
you even if you don't have top-shelf

188
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:56,150
extracts with you you're always welcome

189
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:58,340
I did not purchase one at this time but

190
00:06:56,149 --> 00:07:00,289
I will in the future it's not something

191
00:06:58,339 --> 00:07:01,969
that's in my budget or my need right now

192
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:03,470
but when I'm ready for I'm gonna grab

193
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:07,340
one of these things it's called the

194
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:10,340
torch list nail it is a dab nail that it

195
00:07:07,339 --> 00:07:14,839
attaches to any rig that is basically

196
00:07:10,339 --> 00:07:16,729
battery-operated so you it's got a

197
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:18,349
battery pack the battery pack is kind of

198
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:19,819
big and kind of cumbersome to be honest

199
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:21,740
with you it's the size of a remote

200
00:07:19,819 --> 00:07:24,379
control but it is heavier than a remote

201
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:26,420
control if you used to drive RC cars

202
00:07:24,379 --> 00:07:28,519
it's like an old RC car battery is what

203
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:30,710
it reminds me of so you plug in this

204
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:31,639
thing has a plug in that comes undone so

205
00:07:30,709 --> 00:07:32,899
you don't always have to have a cord

206
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:35,599
hanging from it but you plug it in it

207
00:07:32,899 --> 00:07:37,789
charges then the coil attaches to it and

208
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:40,100
then the coil attaches to a bowl piece

209
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:41,450
which fits on to your bong or your rig

210
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:43,790
or whatever you want to call it whatever

211
00:07:41,449 --> 00:07:46,879
you use in it attaches to your glass

212
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:49,790
piece then the battery pack has a button

213
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:52,670
when you hold the button that heats up

214
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:55,970
an element inside of the bowl piece if

215
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:57,500
it makes your hash your shatter you know

216
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:59,540
what we tried on it with shatter and

217
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:02,509
butter and wax I did not try solvent

218
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:04,910
list I did not try the I didn't try

219
00:08:02,509 --> 00:08:07,969
anything else so I only know how this

220
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:11,570
works for shatter wax and some buttery

221
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:13,400
type hash so we put plenty and you can

222
00:08:11,569 --> 00:08:14,899
stuff this thing with plenty of hash too

223
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:16,939
we put a lot of hash on there like

224
00:08:14,899 --> 00:08:18,289
probably a half a gram and then you push

225
00:08:16,939 --> 00:08:20,149
the button and hold the button and as

226
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:22,250
soon as you push it the hash starts

227
00:08:20,149 --> 00:08:25,489
melting it takes like it's a very little

228
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:27,319
delay so you start token and once you

229
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:29,180
start getting smoke into your lungs once

230
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:30,649
you start feeling it then I started kind

231
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:32,509
of feathering the button just like let

232
00:08:30,649 --> 00:08:34,159
it go hold it let it go hold it let it

233
00:08:32,509 --> 00:08:35,929
go hold it cuz I like to take a big

234
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,579
chunky dad but what I noticed is as soon

235
00:08:35,929 --> 00:08:40,579
as you let go the button it stops

236
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:42,229
cooking like as soon as you let go so

237
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,979
you can really control your dabs it is

238
00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:45,850
kind of nice

239
00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:48,590
now the part that I was concerned with

240
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:50,269
and it did pass my inspection let me say

241
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:53,180
that before I go too far the part that I

242
00:08:50,269 --> 00:08:55,269
was concerned with is we've got a wire

243
00:08:53,179 --> 00:08:58,719
that goes to a bowl

244
00:08:55,269 --> 00:09:00,338
and that bull is heating something

245
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,940
inside of the bull where I'm keeping my

246
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:05,529
extracts I was worried about heating

247
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:08,110
polyurethane wiring or whatever is

248
00:09:05,528 --> 00:09:10,208
inside of that bowl so my friend Tim

249
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:13,089
gave me the Liberty to take this piece

250
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:14,169
of part and inspect it completely so

251
00:09:13,089 --> 00:09:16,779
inside of there

252
00:09:14,169 --> 00:09:18,338
it's a glass bowl it looks kind of like

253
00:09:16,778 --> 00:09:20,080
your normal bong bowl or if you've got a

254
00:09:18,339 --> 00:09:23,890
health stone pipe it's very similar to

255
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:27,490
that it's a glass bowl with basically a

256
00:09:23,889 --> 00:09:30,699
titanium screen inside of it and wrapped

257
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:32,589
around that titanium screen is and we

258
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:34,690
weren't sure if it was copper or brass

259
00:09:32,589 --> 00:09:37,540
but wrapped around that titanium screen

260
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:39,970
is a copper or brass coil it almost

261
00:09:37,539 --> 00:09:42,129
looks it almost looks like an alligator

262
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:43,750
clip or a battery clip for your car like

263
00:09:42,129 --> 00:09:45,370
we're car battery goes in it almost

264
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:47,708
looks like that wrapped around a

265
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:50,019
titanium disc placed inside of a glass

266
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:53,649
bowl so as soon as you press the button

267
00:09:50,019 --> 00:09:56,289
that that copper or brass element

268
00:09:53,649 --> 00:09:59,049
essentially heats up around that

269
00:09:56,289 --> 00:10:00,399
titanium disc because of the electricity

270
00:09:59,049 --> 00:10:02,949
flowing through it it heats up and

271
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,629
that's what melts your dabs and then as

272
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:06,879
soon as you let go of it you can touch

273
00:10:04,629 --> 00:10:08,500
the glass and it's not hot you can hold

274
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:12,730
the glass while you take your dabs and

275
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:15,159
it won't burn you so if you were to

276
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:16,990
maybe think about dabbing in the car on

277
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:20,889
the road and you didn't want to use the

278
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:22,659
torch this device would be perfect

279
00:10:20,889 --> 00:10:25,480
you just push a little button and you

280
00:10:22,659 --> 00:10:28,240
inhale and you get pretty healthy pretty

281
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:31,028
chunky ribs I have to say the torch 'la

282
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:33,519
snail is Rasta Jeff approved I'm gonna

283
00:10:31,028 --> 00:10:35,110
give it at least a solid four stars if I

284
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:37,120
could play with it again I would give it

285
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:39,759
five full stars I've never done a real

286
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,139
full rating test or anything you know

287
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:42,879
what I mean we don't have a rating scale

288
00:10:41,139 --> 00:10:45,129
but on a scale of one to five I'm gonna

289
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:46,450
give it a solid four and then if I get

290
00:10:45,129 --> 00:10:48,939
to play with it a couple more times and

291
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:50,500
learn the button feathering the

292
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:52,779
technique how much to push and let go

293
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:55,089
that sucker just might get five stars

294
00:10:52,778 --> 00:10:57,220
you know I want to compare it I want to

295
00:10:55,089 --> 00:10:58,870
take my normal rig with me for a day and

296
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:00,879
take the torch list nail with me for a

297
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:02,889
day and see which one I end up hitting

298
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:04,480
on the second day like day one maybe

299
00:11:02,889 --> 00:11:06,189
I'll get tired of torch in maybe day two

300
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,080
or day one I'll get tired of pushing the

301
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:09,630
button

302
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:10,889
I'm just see which one I like better but

303
00:11:09,629 --> 00:11:12,689
that's enough ranting about the torch

304
00:11:10,889 --> 00:11:14,730
loose nail if you're interested in a

305
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:16,020
torturous nail let me know I will put

306
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:17,909
you in touch with my friend who

307
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:19,500
distributes them we'll try to get you

308
00:11:17,909 --> 00:11:21,480
the best deal possible since I just

309
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:24,059
advertised them very well on the podcast

310
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,649
for him let me say this he did not pay

311
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:27,719
me to say any of this he brought the

312
00:11:25,649 --> 00:11:29,220
nail to be kind to let me check it out

313
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,529
because I told him I was curious about

314
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:33,240
the inside so big shout out to Tim if

315
00:11:31,529 --> 00:11:35,069

316
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,690

00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:42,090
going well for you so let's get into

319
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:44,970
some news articles you guys um on two

320
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:47,610
podcasts ago our buddy Mike was here and

321
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:50,610
we talked about a raid a raid where the

322
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:53,970
police officers used the battering ram

323
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:55,440
to bash in the door of a dispensary that

324
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:57,899
the dispensary was open and the door was

325
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:01,110
unlocked then they proceeded to treat

326
00:11:57,899 --> 00:12:02,610
all of the customers like criminals when

327
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:04,860
nobody was committing a crime they were

328
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:06,629
actually there to serve a cease and

329
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:09,750
desist order is what they should have

330
00:12:06,629 --> 00:12:11,129
done but instead they went in they

331
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:13,110
treated everybody like criminals

332
00:12:11,129 --> 00:12:17,909
they destroyed most of the dispensary

333
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:19,680
excuse me I'm burping ah these cops were

334
00:12:17,909 --> 00:12:21,449
complete [ __ ] what I thought they

335
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:23,339
did was completely disrespectful and

336
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:26,009
apparently some other people did too

337
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:28,740
because there is a news article this

338
00:12:26,009 --> 00:12:30,360
news article comes from ABC 7 dot-com I

339
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:33,029
found this on a lot of different places

340
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:34,800
but this article was the best written

341
00:12:33,029 --> 00:12:36,299
and the most understandable and it kept

342
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:37,379
to the point the most and it mentioned

343
00:12:36,299 --> 00:12:40,469
some things that a couple of other

344
00:12:37,379 --> 00:12:42,269
articles did not mention excuse my

345
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:43,680
coughing I'm going to get into the news

346
00:12:42,269 --> 00:12:47,779
article here right after I take a quick

347
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:47,779
drink and then we will get into it

348
00:12:48,139 --> 00:12:57,110
oh that was a long drink but [ __ ] yeah

349
00:12:54,019 --> 00:12:59,659
it was worth it alright this news

350
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:02,360
article comes from ABC 7 comm and it is

351
00:12:59,659 --> 00:13:05,509
written by a man named Greg Lee this

352
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:07,370
article was posted June 15 2015 it says

353
00:13:05,509 --> 00:13:09,889
Long Beach California in lawsuit was

354
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:11,929
filed Monday by attorney Matthew Pappas

355
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:13,819
on behalf of sky-high wholistic accusing

356
00:13:11,929 --> 00:13:16,099
Santa Ana Police Department the city of

357
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:18,680
Santa Ana and Santa Ana Mayor Miguel

358
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:20,570
Toledo of taking bribes from marijuana

359
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:23,179
dispensaries in exchange for favorable

360
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:25,310
treatment this following a controversial

361
00:13:23,179 --> 00:13:26,839
police raid at the marijuana dispensary

362
00:13:25,309 --> 00:13:28,729
on May 26 that was caught on

363
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:30,470
surveillance video and shows police

364
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:32,389
playing darts an officer making

365
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:34,610
demeaning remarks about an amputee and

366
00:13:32,389 --> 00:13:37,069
another officer eating what appears to

367
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:38,360
be pot laced edibles you guys if you

368
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:40,610
listened to the podcast we watched the

369
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:42,740
video last time and I'm 90% sure that

370
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:43,129
that dude ate an edible right off of the

371
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:45,049
shelf

372
00:13:43,129 --> 00:13:47,629
- cops ate edibles right off the shelves

373
00:13:45,049 --> 00:13:49,519
I'll continue with the article it says

374
00:13:47,629 --> 00:13:51,230
it's deplorable that city officials and

375
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:52,490
people seeking financial gain would use

376
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:55,190
the police to accomplish their

377
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:56,960
self-serving goals Papa said at a news

378
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:58,820
conference in Long Beach Papa's Outland

379
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:01,040
the lawsuit he filed in federal court

380
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:02,990
the suit alleges that patio and other

381
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:05,059
city employees favorited certain

382
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:06,919
dispensaries over others the city of

383
00:14:05,059 --> 00:14:08,719
Santa Ana used a lottery system just

384
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:11,509
like 20 pot shops to operate legally

385
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,190
under a new voter approved plan the

386
00:14:11,509 --> 00:14:16,370
lawsuit alleges that at least one

387
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:18,560
dispensary which paid Pulido was

388
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:20,029
selected so this dispensary paid for

389
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:22,009
their [ __ ] spot in the lottery which

390
00:14:20,029 --> 00:14:23,360
is shitty and this dude allegedly

391
00:14:22,009 --> 00:14:25,429
allegedly I have to use the word

392
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:29,360
allegedly this dude allegedly took the

393
00:14:25,429 --> 00:14:31,039
damn money the article goes on holistic

394
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,019
did not win a spot in the lottery and

395
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:34,549
its patients allege that because Polito

396
00:14:33,019 --> 00:14:35,929
and other city employees had financial

397
00:14:34,549 --> 00:14:37,819
ties with competing marijuana

398
00:14:35,929 --> 00:14:40,039
dispensaries they use their positions to

399
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:42,110
close down the competition including

400
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:44,779
including shutting down power and water

401
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:46,550
services the suit said Pappas released

402
00:14:44,779 --> 00:14:48,169
an edited surveillance video last week

403
00:14:46,549 --> 00:14:50,149
showing what the lawsuit described as

404
00:14:48,169 --> 00:14:52,219
excessive and unreasonable actions by

405
00:14:50,149 --> 00:14:53,870
police officers during the raid and I

406
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:57,080
will agree with both of those statements

407
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:59,149
excessive and unreasonable the suit said

408
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:01,710
that the suit said officers caused more

409
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:04,169
than $100,000 to video surveillance

410
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:06,180
equipment safes furniture doors and

411
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:08,069
other property an internal investigation

412
00:15:06,179 --> 00:15:08,789
by the Santa Ana Police Department is

413
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:12,629
ongoing

414
00:15:08,789 --> 00:15:15,689
retired la la PD deputy chief Stephen

415
00:15:12,629 --> 00:15:17,580
downing echoed at acute the accusations

416
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:19,440
at the news conference Monday police

417
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:21,750
officers should not behave that way it

418
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:24,450
was unprofessional downing said Pulido

419
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:26,039
Rees released the video statement Monday

420
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:28,379
afternoon in response to the lawsuit

421
00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:30,179
these allegations are unequivocally

422
00:15:28,379 --> 00:15:32,159
false and the city will be responding to

423
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:33,959
this lawsuit he also said he has no

424
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:36,539
financial interest or stake in any

425
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:38,580
dispensary this article was from The

426
00:15:36,539 --> 00:15:40,169
Associated proud the Associated Press

427
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:42,300
didn't contribute to this article I have

428
00:15:40,169 --> 00:15:45,299
to mention at that part at the end so

429
00:15:42,299 --> 00:15:46,740
they are suing they are going to file a

430
00:15:45,299 --> 00:15:50,069
lawsuit they have filed a lawsuit

431
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:52,200
against the cops that did this [ __ ] so

432
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:54,510
hopefully they don't get away with this

433
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:57,379
hopefully this sets a new standard you

434
00:15:54,509 --> 00:16:00,509
know maybe this will make a difference

435
00:15:57,379 --> 00:16:02,429
we can't have cops raiding places and

436
00:16:00,509 --> 00:16:04,620
eating edibles so they did over a

437
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:07,409
hundred thousand dollars in damage I

438
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:09,240
hope they sue these guys for what like

439
00:16:07,409 --> 00:16:10,559
three or four times that because you're

440
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,180
gonna have to fix it and then you're

441
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:14,309
gonna have to recoup your losses you're

442
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:15,870
gonna have to catch up from all the

443
00:16:14,309 --> 00:16:17,250
business that you've missed yeah

444
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:20,399
they sued for at least three or four

445
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:22,529
times this part all right I'm gonna move

446
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:26,519
on to another news article here which

447
00:16:22,529 --> 00:16:28,589
one is next all right here we go this

448
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:33,240
one is from ooh right here at home the

449
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:35,129
pueblos chief Dan this one says Colorado

450
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,600
workers can be fired for using pot off

451
00:16:35,129 --> 00:16:38,909
duty

452
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,769
ah the circles from Denver it's written

453
00:16:38,909 --> 00:16:43,198
by Kristen Wyatt of The Associated Press

454
00:16:40,769 --> 00:16:45,000
it says pop may be legal in Colorado but

455
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:46,708
you can still be fired for using it the

456
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,448
state Supreme Court ruled five to one

457
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:49,919
Monday that a medical marijuana patient

458
00:16:48,448 --> 00:16:52,198
who was fired for failing a drug test

459
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:53,939
cannot get his job back the case was

460
00:16:52,198 --> 00:16:55,469
being watched closely by employers and

461
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:56,699
pot smokers and states that have

462
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:59,250
legalized medical or recreational

463
00:16:56,698 --> 00:17:00,809
marijuana Colorado became the fourth

464
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:02,698
state in which courts have ruled against

465
00:17:00,809 --> 00:17:05,009
medical marijuana patients fired for pot

466
00:17:02,698 --> 00:17:06,899
use supreme courts in California Montana

467
00:17:05,009 --> 00:17:09,419
and Washington State have made similar

468
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:11,640
rulings so I'm gonna jump in here for a

469
00:17:09,419 --> 00:17:13,409
minute this uh this article kind of

470
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:16,259
frustrated a lot of people but honestly

471
00:17:13,409 --> 00:17:18,000
nothing has changed with this new ruling

472
00:17:16,259 --> 00:17:19,828
Colorado has always been an at-will

473
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,349
state which means you can be fired for

474
00:17:19,828 --> 00:17:23,879
anything or nothing you don't have to be

475
00:17:22,349 --> 00:17:25,048
given a reason your boss can walk them

476
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:27,059
and say guess what you're fired by

477
00:17:25,048 --> 00:17:28,650
here's your last paycheck so at any

478
00:17:27,058 --> 00:17:32,490
minute you can be fired for no reason

479
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:37,430
it's an at-will state so even if they

480
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:39,289
did find cannabis in your system

481
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:40,490
and it was legal they could still fire

482
00:17:39,289 --> 00:17:41,509
you if they wanted to they could just

483
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:43,549
say ha ha you're fired

484
00:17:41,509 --> 00:17:46,129
alright let me get back into the article

485
00:17:43,549 --> 00:17:47,899
or the whole alright the Colorado worker

486
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:49,340
Brandon Coates is a quadriplegic who was

487
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:52,309
fired by Dish Network after felling

488
00:17:49,339 --> 00:17:53,750
failing a drug test in 2010 the company

489
00:17:52,308 --> 00:17:55,099
agreed that Coates wasn't high on the

490
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:58,130
job but they said they have a

491
00:17:55,099 --> 00:17:59,719
zero-tolerance drug policy Coates argue

492
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:01,160
that his pot smoking was allowed under a

493
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:03,319
state law intended to protect employees

494
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:04,850
from being fired for legal activities

495
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:07,099
off the clock Coates didn't use

496
00:18:04,849 --> 00:18:10,308
marijuana at work but pots intoxicating

497
00:18:07,099 --> 00:18:12,949
chemical THC holy crap excuse me

498
00:18:10,308 --> 00:18:14,450
pots intoxicated chemical THC can stay

499
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:16,670
in the system for weeks and once again

500
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:18,110
these guys used chemical I don't think

501
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:19,400
the word chemical is appropriate there

502
00:18:18,109 --> 00:18:22,639
but we'll just let them do their thing

503
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:24,320
they are professionals hey I'm go on

504
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,730
with the article the Colorado Justice

505
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:27,710
ruled that because marijuana is illegal

506
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:29,210
under federal law coats's use of the

507
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:31,819
drug couldn't be considered legal

508
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:32,840
off-duty activity there's no exception

509
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:35,720
for marijuana used for medicinal

510
00:18:32,839 --> 00:18:37,399
purposes or for marijuana use conducted

511
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:39,650
in accordance with state law the court

512
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:41,000
wrote Coates and his lawyers said after

513
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:42,890
the ruling that the decision at least

514
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,140
clarified the matters for workers

515
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:47,150
although I'm very disappointed today I

516
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:49,700
hope that my case has brought the issue

517
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:51,769
of use of medical marijuana and

518
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:52,720
employment to light Coates said in a

519
00:18:51,769 --> 00:18:54,889
statement

520
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:57,710
attorneys for dishnetwork and the state

521
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:59,300
of Colorado which filed a brief filed a

522
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:00,850
brief in support of the company were not

523
00:18:59,299 --> 00:19:03,079
immediately available for comment

524
00:19:00,849 --> 00:19:04,459
twenty-three states and Washington DC

525
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:07,069
allowed medical marijuana

526
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:09,590
Alaska Colorado Oregon Washington State

527
00:19:07,069 --> 00:19:12,200
and Washington DC have legalized

528
00:19:09,589 --> 00:19:14,599
recreational sales the court cases so

529
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:16,250
far have involved medical patients the

530
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:17,899
Colorado Constitution specifically

531
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:19,160
states that employers don't have to

532
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:23,269
amend their policies to accommodate

533
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:25,130
employees marijuana use Coates was

534
00:19:23,269 --> 00:19:27,319
paralyzed in a car crash as a teenager

535
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:29,480
and has been a medical marijuana patient

536
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:32,178
since 2009 when he discovered that pot

537
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:33,799
helped calm violent muscle spasms it was

538
00:19:32,179 --> 00:19:35,150
a telephone operator with ditch for

539
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:38,359
three years before he failed a random

540
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:41,150
drug test in 2010 and was fired he said

541
00:19:38,359 --> 00:19:43,529
he told his supervisor in advance and he

542
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:46,470
would probably fail the drug test

543
00:19:43,529 --> 00:19:48,119
so big shout-out to what's-his-name

544

big shout-out to this guy he did lose

547
00:19:51,509 --> 00:19:54,690
his job but he tried to stand up for

548
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:56,789
himself and he took it like a champ dude

549
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:59,549
he said well [ __ ] at least we know now

550
00:19:56,789 --> 00:20:00,509

and getting this part done well so I'm

568
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:34,440
gonna move on to one more news article

569
00:20:33,269 --> 00:20:36,990

570

to stay with the show here all right so

577
00:20:47,609 --> 00:20:51,449
this next article I found this I

578
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:53,009

581
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:57,090
minutes straight and then the throat

582
00:20:55,619 --> 00:20:58,319

583

out shout out to water that [ __ ] alright

585
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:12,240
so this article comes from the cannabis

586
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:15,330
and it is written by of course written

587
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:18,059
by our good friend Ricardo Baca and I

588
00:21:15,329 --> 00:21:19,919
got my attention because it says Oregon

589
00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:22,259
Police compare piles of wheat to a

590
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:24,630
voodoo doughnut as visual aid and they

591
00:21:22,259 --> 00:21:26,279
actually do this it says if you're an

592
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:28,350
organ and passionate about marijuana

593
00:21:26,279 --> 00:21:31,230
reform Wednesday is legitimately a

594
00:21:28,349 --> 00:21:33,779
mammoth day starting July 1st adults can

595
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:36,059
possess and use grow and share cannabis

596
00:21:33,779 --> 00:21:37,769
and Oregon the shops won't be open just

597
00:21:36,059 --> 00:21:40,349
yet that comes in the fall officials

598
00:21:37,769 --> 00:21:42,150
think but July 1st will represent too

599
00:21:40,349 --> 00:21:44,549
many the beginning of a new era in the

600
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:46,140
Pacific Northwest state but how much

601
00:21:44,549 --> 00:21:48,389
marijuana will a person be able to

602
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:50,550
legally possess in Oregon as our handy

603
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:52,860
Oregon Marijuana guide says anyone over

604
00:21:50,549 --> 00:21:54,379
21 in Oregon can possess up to eight

605
00:21:52,859 --> 00:21:56,509
ounces of use alone use

606
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:59,290
marijuana's such as dried butts at home

607
00:21:56,509 --> 00:22:02,329
and up to one ounce outside of the home

608
00:21:59,289 --> 00:22:04,940
but especially since weed is coming out

609
00:22:02,329 --> 00:22:07,099
of a very dark control closet in Oregon

610
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:09,890
an average pot lender Portlander sari

611
00:22:07,099 --> 00:22:12,439
might not know how much cannabis makes

612
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:13,820
up an ounce or an 8 or 8 ounces okay

613
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:15,559
sorry this article is written it's all

614
00:22:13,819 --> 00:22:17,539
squished into one little frame here

615
00:22:15,559 --> 00:22:18,589
trying to read it right though and

616
00:22:17,539 --> 00:22:20,539
perhaps they don't have a laboratory

617
00:22:18,589 --> 00:22:22,189
grade digitally calibrated scale in

618
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:24,950
their desk drawer either oh they should

619
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:26,660
Colorado everyone's got a digi scale it

620
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:28,910
says you're not legal weed officiant

621
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:30,560
aficionados the Portland Police are here

622
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:32,029
to help in a very straightforward and

623
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:33,799
all most sweetly maternal blog the

624
00:22:32,029 --> 00:22:35,450
Department encourages community members

625
00:22:33,799 --> 00:22:37,609
to be responsible and consider it with a

626
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:39,650
recreational marijuana they tell people

627
00:22:37,609 --> 00:22:41,329
that stoned driving is a crime public

628
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:43,130
consumption could result in a citation

629
00:22:41,329 --> 00:22:45,829
and bringing Washington bought weed into

630
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:48,110
Oregon is a federal no-no with that last

631
00:22:45,829 --> 00:22:49,849
note being a bit of a turnaround from

632
00:22:48,109 --> 00:22:50,869
the department's previous statements so

633
00:22:49,849 --> 00:22:52,519
they must have went back on something

634
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:54,979
they said earlier we'll have to research

635
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:56,960
that so the best part of the Portland

636
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:59,480
Police memo the visual aid that compares

637
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:01,670
a pile of weed to a voodoo doughnut one

638
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:03,620
of the state's most celebrated edibles

639
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:05,720
which is not of course is not infused

640
00:23:03,619 --> 00:23:07,159
it's one of those popular snacks in

641
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,930
Portland if you ever go there you have

642
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:10,880
to have a voodoo doughnut it is

643
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:12,200
definitely super popular all my friends

644
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,220
in portland always talk about it I hate

645
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,390
you guys they're eating them right now

646
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:16,880
send me one anyway

647
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:18,259
so it says so how much weed makes up an

648
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,240
ounce the legal amount you'll be able to

649
00:23:18,259 --> 00:23:21,710
have on your person in Oregon about the

650
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,690
size of a doughnut if not a little

651
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:26,090
bigger so imagine that you guys in

652
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:28,400
Oregon you're allowed to have a doughnut

653
00:23:26,089 --> 00:23:29,659
pile sized amount of weed so if you get

654
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,730
pulled over by the cops and you got some

655
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:33,590
weed on you know like how much weed you

656
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:35,240
got you're like this much is that cop

657
00:23:33,589 --> 00:23:37,519
gonna go to his car and pull out his

658
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:38,539
doughnut and [ __ ] set the donuts cuz

659
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:40,160
you know the cops got it going on the

660
00:23:38,539 --> 00:23:42,019
car is he gonna go get a doughnut and

661
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:43,880
set that donut down and set it next to

662
00:23:42,019 --> 00:23:45,339
your early be like hey I think you're

663
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:47,480
cool bro you can get away with that

664
00:23:45,339 --> 00:23:49,099
that's gonna be [ __ ] funny all right

665
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:51,140
and then it says what about eight ounces

666
00:23:49,099 --> 00:23:53,389
this legal about you're able to have at

667
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:55,190
home in Oregon about the size of a pile

668
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:58,190
of donuts it doesn't completely dwarf

669
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:59,930
the doughnut he'd be able to climb

670
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:02,090
Oh he'd be able to climb that pile of

671
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:03,650
weed if he could climb so you'd have

672
00:24:02,089 --> 00:24:04,730
eight doughnuts worth weed right if you

673
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:06,620
could have 8 ounces you'd have about

674
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:07,470
eight doughnuts so you'd have a dozen

675
00:24:06,619 --> 00:24:09,658
doughnuts plus two

676
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:10,919
extra worth of weed so just visualize

677
00:24:09,659 --> 00:24:12,480
that next time you want to know how much

678
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:13,288
weed you can carry around in Portland

679
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,538
this is weird

680
00:24:13,288 --> 00:24:17,700
all right the article goes on to say

681
00:24:15,538 --> 00:24:19,079
it's a genius ploy on the police's part

682
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,580
and the inclusion of donuts inside

683
00:24:19,079 --> 00:24:22,349
official police marketing material

684
00:24:20,579 --> 00:24:24,509
surely isn't lost on anyone checking out

685
00:24:22,349 --> 00:24:26,399
the truly modern graphic it takes us

686
00:24:24,509 --> 00:24:28,890
back in fact to when Denver's police had

687
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,970
some 420 friendly fun on their own when

688
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:31,350
they dropped this smart hip-hop

689
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:33,750
reference on their official Twitter

690
00:24:31,349 --> 00:24:36,269
account on this last 4/20 weekend and I

691
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:37,950
think I remember that they said we see

692
00:24:36,269 --> 00:24:39,119
you roll in and we ain't hatin but then

693
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:40,919
they talked about all the rules that you

694
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:43,379
had to follow to uh smoke weed in

695
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:44,788
Colorado alright so the article goes on

696
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:47,309
to say Portland and Denver will share

697
00:24:44,788 --> 00:24:49,558
more than just legal weed on July 1st in

698
00:24:47,308 --> 00:24:52,319
December 2013 the city's beloved booty

699
00:24:49,558 --> 00:24:54,599
Donna's open its first shop outside of

700
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:55,859
Oregon in Denver of course so the next

701
00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:57,269
time I'm in Denver I'm definitely gonna

702
00:24:55,859 --> 00:24:59,339
go grab myself from some voodoo

703
00:24:57,269 --> 00:25:01,529
doughnuts if there's not a line there's

704
00:24:59,339 --> 00:25:03,209
always a line at that [ __ ] alright so

705
00:25:01,529 --> 00:25:04,558
shout out to the cannabis thanks for

706
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:06,390
letting me read articles from there

707
00:25:04,558 --> 00:25:08,339
so be careful you guys if you go to

708
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:09,659
Oregon make sure to get some donuts and

709
00:25:08,339 --> 00:25:12,058
that way you can measure how much

710
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:14,070
cannabis you can legally possess you're

711
00:25:12,058 --> 00:25:16,200
gonna have one donut on your person or

712
00:25:14,069 --> 00:25:18,178
eight donuts worth of weed at your home

713
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,710
let's see how long we've been recording

714
00:25:18,179 --> 00:25:21,440
I might start wrapping this up

715
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:23,850
yeah we're closing up the show dude

716
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:30,470
let's start closing this up what do I

717
00:25:23,849 --> 00:25:32,609
got I got some notes did that

718
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:34,769
let's see somebody told me something

719
00:25:32,609 --> 00:25:36,389
that really uh that really stuck to my

720
00:25:34,769 --> 00:25:37,859
head they said a good ganja farmer will

721
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:39,240
never put something off for tomorrow if

722
00:25:37,859 --> 00:25:40,589
you see it needs to be done today get in

723
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:42,538
there and do it that's the difference

724
00:25:40,589 --> 00:25:44,069
between growing top shelf buds and mids

725
00:25:42,538 --> 00:25:47,099
and I've never agreed with the statement

726
00:25:44,069 --> 00:25:50,849
more that's definitely something that I

727
00:25:47,099 --> 00:25:52,349
agree with so you guys Spencer should be

728
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:55,168
on a show pretty soon I'm gonna do a

729
00:25:52,349 --> 00:25:57,779
show about improving your garden pretty

730
00:25:55,169 --> 00:25:59,340
soon we're gonna do I'm going to try to

731
00:25:57,779 --> 00:26:02,308
find a photographer to come on here and

732
00:25:59,339 --> 00:26:04,439
talk to us about cannabis photography if

733
00:26:02,308 --> 00:26:06,418
you are in if you're local to me and

734
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:07,650
you're a cannabis photographer I would

735
00:26:06,419 --> 00:26:09,630
love for you to come on the show and

736
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:11,730
teach my listeners how to take better

737
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:13,559
pictures of their ganja plants I take

738
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:15,480
pretty decent pictures but I don't think

739
00:26:13,558 --> 00:26:16,769
I am an experienced enough photographer

740
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:18,358
to come on here and teach everybody how

741
00:26:16,769 --> 00:26:19,979
to do it

742
00:26:18,358 --> 00:26:21,960
we're also going to talk about ways to

743
00:26:19,979 --> 00:26:22,979
improve your crop I think I said that

744
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,960
Spencer will be out here that'll

745
00:26:22,979 --> 00:26:26,639

00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:20,529
forgetting that it's right near the

819
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:22,058

820
00:33:20,529 --> 00:33:23,440
loud booms and I want to get up and go

too far I am on periscope once again

858
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:34,809
there's an application called periscope

859
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:36,939
where we can record everything live I'm

860
00:34:34,809 --> 00:34:37,989
broadcasting live to other 10 people

861
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:39,220
watching me right now there'll be

862
00:34:37,989 --> 00:34:41,918
hopefully a few more by the end of the

863
00:34:39,219 --> 00:34:43,509
show if you ever want to watch me on

864
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:45,069
periscope I kind of record randomly I

865
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:46,450
don't set a good schedule I'm going to

866
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:47,980
have to set a schedule so that I can get

867
00:34:46,449 --> 00:34:50,259
you guys on periscope with me we'll

868
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:51,338
start making a date of it but right now

869
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:52,690
to the people that are on periscope

870
00:34:51,338 --> 00:34:54,338
watching you guys I'm not gonna pay

871
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:56,260
attention to the comments until toward

872
00:34:54,338 --> 00:34:58,029
the end of the show I'm going to record

873
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:59,349
about a 20 minute show and then I'll

874
00:34:58,030 --> 00:35:01,300
open it up for questions and I will

875
00:34:59,349 --> 00:35:03,640
accept questions from my viewers that

876
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:05,050
are on periscope so I'm gonna have to

877
00:35:03,639 --> 00:35:06,429
make this a regular thing so that I can

878
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:07,780
schedule this so that my friends and

879
00:35:06,429 --> 00:35:09,489
fans can get on here and listen at the

880
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:11,530
proper time and watch me on periscope

881
00:35:09,489 --> 00:35:13,569
and interact but tonight this is kind of

882
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:14,769
my test run I didn't want to advertise

883
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:16,240
that I was gonna do this because I

884
00:35:14,769 --> 00:35:18,400
didn't want to get bombarded and get

885
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:20,319
overwhelmed but at the end of this

886
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,480
podcast once I do my news articles and

887
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:25,210

888
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:27,969
open up the floor for questions from my

889
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:30,460
periscope viewers so let me keep the

890
00:35:27,969 --> 00:35:32,139

915
00:36:19,659 --> 00:36:23,108
small amounts of marijuana the state is

916
00:36:21,489 --> 00:36:25,328

950
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:45,820
Johnson added though he doesn't expect

951
00:37:43,539 --> 00:37:48,130
much increased demand for it he means

952
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:50,349
for cannabis and then he goes on to say

953
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:51,789
smoking it in public is illegal but in

954
00:37:50,349 --> 00:37:53,619
Portland police are discouraging

955
00:37:51,789 --> 00:37:55,869

pot smokers the Portland chapter of

957
00:37:55,869 --> 00:37:59,680
National Organization for the Reform of

958
00:37:57,608 --> 00:38:01,690
Marijuana Laws posted on its website

959
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:03,399
that it would have a tent set up at the

960
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:05,260
west side of the Burnside Bridge for a

961
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:07,539
midnight countdown to the end of

962
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:09,580
marijuana prohibition the site offers a

963
00:38:07,539 --> 00:38:11,920
big neon sign in the shape of Oregon as

964
00:38:09,579 --> 00:38:14,380
a background for selfies of revelers who

965
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:16,480
light up I could just imagine that you

966
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:18,070
guys a big-ass sign shaped like Oregon

967
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,500
with people just dabbing out and puffing

968
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:21,869
down in front of it that's pretty great

969
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:24,460
I'll continue with the article it says

970
00:38:21,869 --> 00:38:27,280
adults will be allowed to possess up to

971
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:30,309
a half a pound and grow four plants but

972
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:32,920
not yet to buy or sell it I will be a

973
00:38:30,309 --> 00:38:34,570
few months to more than a year before it

974
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:37,720
is legal to sell and then only with a

975
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:39,730
state permit so right now it says adults

976
00:38:37,719 --> 00:38:41,019
will be allowed to possess up to a pound

977
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:43,269
and they'll be allowed to grow up to

978
00:38:41,019 --> 00:38:45,730
four plants we talked about the last

979
00:38:43,269 --> 00:38:47,800
episode that pound are that half a pound

980
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:49,719
I'm sorry that half a pound has to stay

981
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:52,180
at home and you're allowed to carry up

982
00:38:49,719 --> 00:38:54,519
to one ounce with you and just in case

983
00:38:52,179 --> 00:38:56,079
you were confused Oregon issued a nice

984
00:38:54,519 --> 00:38:58,088
little statement that showed you that

985
00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:00,489
one ounce of cannabis is approximately

986
00:38:58,088 --> 00:39:01,750
the size of one voodoo doughnut so

987
00:39:00,489 --> 00:39:04,059
that's how much you're allowed to carry

988
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:06,250
around with you the article goes on to

989
00:39:04,059 --> 00:39:08,170
say the legislature is continuing

990
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:10,329
considering I'm sorry the legislature is

991
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:12,130
considering a bill to allow medical

992
00:39:10,329 --> 00:39:14,139
marijuana dispensaries to start selling

993
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:17,910
small amounts to anyone 21 and over on

994
00:39:14,139 --> 00:39:20,650
October 1st in order to get over the in

995
00:39:17,909 --> 00:39:23,409
incongruity of marijuana being legal to

996
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:25,300
have it and grow but not to buy sorry I

997
00:39:23,409 --> 00:39:27,190
stumbled over that word you guys a state

998
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:28,839
regulated retail system is not expected

999
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:29,530
to be fully up and running until late

1000
00:39:28,838 --> 00:39:31,269
next year

1001
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:33,670
jurors are expected to be able to start

1002
00:39:31,269 --> 00:39:35,469
applying for licenses in January with

1003
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:37,950
permits for processors wholesalers and

1004
00:39:35,469 --> 00:39:40,149
retailers rolling out in succession

1005
00:39:37,949 --> 00:39:42,399
growers are already gearing up

1006
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:44,108
particularly in Southern Oregon long

1007
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:46,420
known as a prime climate for outdoor

1008
00:39:44,108 --> 00:39:48,250
growing Jackson County Building Services

1009
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:49,338
director Kelly madding said they have

1010
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:50,900
received 17

1011
00:39:49,338 --> 00:39:53,119
complaints over the past six months of

1012
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:55,729
marijuana growers violating land use

1013
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:57,829
laws trees along a creek were cut down

1014
00:39:55,728 --> 00:39:59,449
and a vernal pool habitat for a

1015
00:39:57,829 --> 00:40:01,609
protected species of freshwater shrimp

1016
00:39:59,449 --> 00:40:03,228
was bulldozed four citations have been

1017
00:40:01,608 --> 00:40:04,670
issued guys if you're gonna grow

1018
00:40:03,228 --> 00:40:07,399
cannabis and you're gonna do it out and

1019
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:09,559
somebody's land or out in some land be

1020
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:10,940
be aware of what you're doing be mindful

1021
00:40:09,559 --> 00:40:13,009
of what you're destroying don't go

1022
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:14,900
[ __ ] bulldoze a lake that's

1023
00:40:13,009 --> 00:40:16,728
ridiculous don't do that kind of [ __ ]

1024
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:18,380
and don't cut down a bunch of trees

1025
00:40:16,728 --> 00:40:20,210
ridiculously and irresponsibly

1026
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:22,548
especially on somebody else's land pay

1027
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:24,139
attention to what you're doing your

1028
00:40:22,548 --> 00:40:27,349
profit and your cannabis crop comes

1029
00:40:24,139 --> 00:40:28,129
second to our environment all right with

1030
00:40:27,349 --> 00:40:30,318
the legalization of recreational

1031
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:32,119
marijuana I think that we are seeing a

1032
00:40:30,318 --> 00:40:34,429
move to our area by people who maybe

1033
00:40:32,119 --> 00:40:36,140
from out of state out of the area who

1034
00:40:34,429 --> 00:40:37,818
don't really know or understand our land

1035
00:40:36,139 --> 00:40:40,429
use laws and our environmental

1036
00:40:37,818 --> 00:40:42,228
protection she said once a month veteran

1037
00:40:40,429 --> 00:40:44,659
medical marijuana growers and hopeful

1038
00:40:42,228 --> 00:40:46,038
newbies gather in the old Grange Hall in

1039
00:40:44,659 --> 00:40:47,719
the community of Williams to hear the

1040
00:40:46,039 --> 00:40:49,789
latest updates on the legislators

1041
00:40:47,719 --> 00:40:52,039
legislatures process on framing

1042
00:40:49,789 --> 00:40:54,349
regulations and tips on how to grow a

1043
00:40:52,039 --> 00:40:56,180
healthy happy marijuana plants it's a

1044
00:40:54,349 --> 00:40:58,729
really hostile business environment but

1045
00:40:56,179 --> 00:41:00,469
things are improving said cedar gray the

1046
00:40:58,728 --> 00:41:02,058
growers guild president and a local home

1047
00:41:00,469 --> 00:41:03,979
builder who along with his wife grow

1048
00:41:02,059 --> 00:41:07,729
medical marijuana and hope to move into

1049
00:41:03,978 --> 00:41:10,608
growing for retail so today is the first

1050
00:41:07,728 --> 00:41:12,949
day but you cannot buy it in a store and

1051
00:41:10,608 --> 00:41:15,409
it's going to be a year before you're

1052
00:41:12,949 --> 00:41:16,939
able to buy cannabis in a store but

1053
00:41:15,409 --> 00:41:19,578
you're able to grow it and it looks like

1054
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:22,519
you're able to give it away so big shout

1055
00:41:19,579 --> 00:41:24,170
out to Oregon I'm proud of them they're

1056
00:41:22,518 --> 00:41:25,788
the fourth state to have recreational

1057
00:41:24,170 --> 00:41:27,318
cannabis we are on our way you guys

1058
00:41:25,789 --> 00:41:29,809
there are only so many states left and

1059
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:32,989
they can't all fight us so that takes me

1060
00:41:29,809 --> 00:41:34,819
to another thing I wanted to read this

1061
00:41:32,989 --> 00:41:36,619
kind of dragged me over where is it I

1062
00:41:34,818 --> 00:41:37,759
had it open on the computer here I'll

1063
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:40,309
just find it again you guys I'm sorry

1064
00:41:37,759 --> 00:41:42,259

1065
00:41:40,309 --> 00:41:46,219
email name and I answered half of their

1066
00:41:42,259 --> 00:41:47,748
question on a previous episode but I

1067
00:41:46,219 --> 00:41:49,190
wasn't able to answer the full question

1068
00:41:47,748 --> 00:41:51,139
because I hadn't had time to think about

1069
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:53,329
it but now I've had time to think about

1070
00:41:51,139 --> 00:41:56,449
it and Mike and I brainstormed on this a

1071
00:41:53,329 --> 00:41:57,499
little bit I'm going to read part of the

1072
00:41:56,449 --> 00:41:59,899
question because I've already answered

1073
00:41:57,498 --> 00:42:02,238
part of the question on the show so this

1074

you've got my respect in turn so your

1094
00:42:33,559 --> 00:42:37,519
question says with Oregon about to turn

1095
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:39,829
recreational I was interested in your

1096
00:42:37,519 --> 00:42:41,750
opinion on niche business opportunities

1097
00:42:39,829 --> 00:42:44,210
and how recreational might affect

1098
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:45,199
medical rules and regulations and then I

1099
00:42:44,210 --> 00:42:46,670
answered the second part of your

1100
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:50,299
question was a which was about trim

1101
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:52,130
machines let me jump into the one part

1102
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:53,330
that I can answer without a lot of

1103
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:55,460
ranting and then I have some that I

1104
00:42:53,329 --> 00:42:58,309
wrote down on the other part you said

1105
00:42:55,460 --> 00:43:00,470
how will how recreational might affect

1106
00:42:58,309 --> 00:43:02,329
medical rules and regulations let me

1107
00:43:00,469 --> 00:43:04,189
tell you that here in Colorado when we

1108
00:43:02,329 --> 00:43:06,049
rolled out recreational cannabis it

1109
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:08,480
looks like we have turned our back on

1110
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:09,560
medical marijuana completely we've given

1111
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:11,630
the finger to the medical marijuana

1112
00:43:09,559 --> 00:43:13,400
patients and this this is not me this is

1113
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:14,780
just how I feel about the industry it

1114
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:17,300
looks like the industry does not care

1115
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:20,119
about medical marijuana anymore there's

1116
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:22,970
more profit there's more supply more

1117
00:43:20,119 --> 00:43:25,640
demand in recreational cannabis so it

1118
00:43:22,969 --> 00:43:28,219
feels like the medical side in Colorado

1119
00:43:25,639 --> 00:43:29,659
is being forgotten and almost be trying

1120
00:43:28,219 --> 00:43:31,189
they're almost attempting to eliminate

1121
00:43:29,659 --> 00:43:35,029
it is what it feels like to me it's

1122
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:36,740
being pushed away so I feel that the

1123
00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:39,740
medical rules are going to affect your

1124
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:41,509
area probably very similarly the growers

1125
00:43:39,739 --> 00:43:43,250
are going to see more profit in the

1126
00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:44,720
recreational side of things and they'll

1127
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:46,250
start getting greedy and they'll stop

1128
00:43:44,719 --> 00:43:49,459
giving to the patients like they have

1129
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:52,760
been the compassion will go away there

1130
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:53,720
are going to start raising prices and

1131
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:55,760
they're going to start selling

1132
00:43:53,719 --> 00:43:57,949
everything on the commercial side of

1133
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:00,500
things instead of the medical side of

1134
00:43:57,949 --> 00:44:02,059
things that's what I predict all right

1135
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:03,469
now I have to open up a couple of notes

1136
00:44:02,059 --> 00:44:05,570
that I have in my computer here because

1137
00:44:03,469 --> 00:44:07,309
I wrote a nice list of things the other

1138
00:44:05,570 --> 00:44:09,650
part of your question is what our niche

1139
00:44:07,309 --> 00:44:12,299
business is that I think might open up I

1140
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:15,210
may be some information or tips

1141
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:18,030
about since Oregon is going recreational

1142
00:44:15,210 --> 00:44:20,639
so I've got a list here if I can close

1143
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:22,980
this one I will be able to open the next

1144
00:44:20,639 --> 00:44:24,119
thing here we go I'm fighting with my

1145
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:27,300
computer while we're at this

1146
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:29,369
alright so businesses and business

1147
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:31,440
opportunities that will arise with

1148
00:44:29,369 --> 00:44:33,710
recreational cannabis in your area and

1149
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:36,349
this will go for everywhere not just

1150
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:39,179
Oregon where it has just become

1151
00:44:36,349 --> 00:44:40,799
recreational legally recreational legal

1152
00:44:39,179 --> 00:44:42,179
that was hard to say but this will go

1153
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,650
along with everywhere where cannabis

1154
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:45,960
becomes available medically and

1155
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:48,510
recreationally businesses that I have

1156
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:50,940
seen pop up personally that are attached

1157
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:52,800
to cannabis but this is not a cannabis

1158
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:54,389
related business so you're not wanting

1159
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:55,680
to be in the dispensary game you don't

1160
00:44:54,389 --> 00:44:58,619
want to work in a dispensary you want to

1161
00:44:55,679 --> 00:45:01,980
open another business here's a nice list

1162
00:44:58,619 --> 00:45:05,159
of opportunities electricians certified

1163
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:06,329
electricians are getting paid huge money

1164
00:45:05,159 --> 00:45:08,099
if you're an electrician and you're

1165
00:45:06,329 --> 00:45:10,710
willing to work with the dispensary or a

1166
00:45:08,099 --> 00:45:13,880
grow you are making huge money right now

1167
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:15,990
that's that's the first step I think

1168
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:18,320
when it was it when we were able to grow

1169
00:45:15,989 --> 00:45:20,219
medical cannabis here in Colorado

1170
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:21,539
everybody built a grow room in their

1171
00:45:20,219 --> 00:45:23,339
house everybody that had a med card

1172
00:45:21,539 --> 00:45:24,659
that's my next something on periscope

1173
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:26,840
just made a great recommendation and

1174
00:45:24,659 --> 00:45:29,489
that's the next one on my list so

1175
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:30,539
electricians everyone's gonna need an

1176
00:45:29,489 --> 00:45:31,799
electrician as soon as it goes

1177
00:45:30,539 --> 00:45:33,889
commercial and everyone's allowed to

1178
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:35,970
grow four or I keep saying commercial

1179
00:45:33,889 --> 00:45:37,379
recreational as soon as it goes

1180
00:45:35,969 --> 00:45:39,329
recreational everyone's allowed to grow

1181
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:40,530
four plants in their house so that means

1182
00:45:39,329 --> 00:45:42,539
everyone's gonna want to build a grow

1183
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:43,830
room most houses aren't equipped to run

1184
00:45:42,539 --> 00:45:45,239
a couple thousand watt lights so

1185
00:45:43,829 --> 00:45:47,400
everyone's going to need an electrician

1186
00:45:45,239 --> 00:45:48,959
and then shits gonna go wrong and people

1187
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:51,059
are gonna want to upgrade so more

1188
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:53,280
electricians all the time following

1189
00:45:51,059 --> 00:45:57,059
electricians would be HVAC technicians

1190
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:59,790
all of the dispensaries have super fancy

1191
00:45:57,059 --> 00:46:01,500
super high-tech HVAC systems if you

1192
00:45:59,789 --> 00:46:03,779
could design state-of-the-art HVAC

1193
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:06,269
systems for grow facilities and or

1194
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:09,510
residential grows that would be very

1195
00:46:06,269 --> 00:46:11,610
useful also construction crews that are

1196
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:13,830
familiar with grow room construction if

1197
00:46:11,610 --> 00:46:16,200
you had a crew that knew how to build a

1198
00:46:13,829 --> 00:46:18,299
grow room if you're a consultant and you

1199
00:46:16,199 --> 00:46:20,250
can design a nice grow room and you can

1200
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:22,710
have a construction crew that knows what

1201
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:23,909
the goal is on building a grow room that

1202
00:46:22,710 --> 00:46:27,630
would be super helpful

1203
00:46:23,909 --> 00:46:29,489
so HVAC electricians and construction

1204
00:46:27,630 --> 00:46:32,900
crews to design and build dispensary

1205
00:46:29,489 --> 00:46:35,098
grows and personal grows after that um

1206
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:36,630
photographers I know that sounds crazy

1207
00:46:35,099 --> 00:46:39,509
but there are two or three photographers

1208
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:40,680
in the Colorado cannabis scene that if

1209
00:46:39,509 --> 00:46:42,449
you told me right now I need a

1210
00:46:40,679 --> 00:46:43,588
photographer for cannabis I would say is

1211
00:46:42,449 --> 00:46:46,259
it for like an event where were

1212
00:46:43,588 --> 00:46:47,429
photographing people or is it something

1213
00:46:46,259 --> 00:46:49,019
where we're gonna take pictures of

1214
00:46:47,429 --> 00:46:50,250
plants and if you said I'm gonna give

1215
00:46:49,018 --> 00:46:52,229
two shout outs here I'm gonna give two

1216
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:53,880
huge shout outs to people if you said I

1217
00:46:52,230 --> 00:46:55,889
want to take pictures of cannabis plants

1218
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:58,170
I would definitely recommend a guy named

1219
00:46:55,889 --> 00:46:59,940
ripe Richard he is the guy you want to

1220
00:46:58,170 --> 00:47:01,440
take pictures of your ganja plants and

1221
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:03,000
if you were taking pictures of a

1222
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:04,950
cannabis event where there are people

1223
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:07,409
and things happening you want Kim

1224
00:47:04,949 --> 00:47:08,848
Sidwell of cannabis camera and they

1225
00:47:07,409 --> 00:47:10,679
didn't pay me to say that those are just

1226
00:47:08,849 --> 00:47:12,390
who I think of so what you want to do is

1227
00:47:10,679 --> 00:47:14,489
become that camera person

1228
00:47:12,389 --> 00:47:16,739

1234
00:47:27,059 --> 00:47:32,970
cannabis industry and work on either

1235
00:47:29,730 --> 00:47:34,798
dispensary rules or personal rules or

1236

1239
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:41,430

1246
00:47:51,028 --> 00:47:56,599
also accountants the dispensaries have a

1247
00:47:54,059 --> 00:47:59,819
lot of money they need an accountant

1248
00:47:56,599 --> 00:48:01,410
advertising teams we need good marketing

1249
00:47:59,818 --> 00:48:03,210

1254
00:48:10,108 --> 00:48:12,588

1255
00:48:11,608 --> 00:48:15,058
types of things

1256
00:48:12,588 --> 00:48:17,308
testing facilities if there's not a

1257
00:48:15,059 --> 00:48:19,140
testing facility in your area if steep

1258
00:48:17,309 --> 00:48:21,390
hill labs if steep hill Halon hasn't

1259
00:48:19,139 --> 00:48:23,009
already moved in in your area then open

1260
00:48:21,389 --> 00:48:24,420
a testing facility or even if they're

1261
00:48:23,009 --> 00:48:26,338
already there open another testing

1262
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:28,019
facility I like that I'm on periscope

1263
00:48:26,338 --> 00:48:29,489
and people are throwing up the ideas

1264
00:48:28,018 --> 00:48:30,689
that I've got on my list here that's a

1265
00:48:29,489 --> 00:48:33,179
good one but I see it and I've got it on

1266
00:48:30,690 --> 00:48:34,710
my list where was I testing facilities

1267
00:48:33,179 --> 00:48:35,460
other ancillary businesses like head

1268
00:48:34,710 --> 00:48:37,260
shops and grow

1269
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:40,019
doors you guys like hi girl indoor

1270
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:44,370
growing supplies those guys are aiming

1271
00:48:40,019 --> 00:48:46,110
at the outdoor and indoor farmer that is

1272
00:48:44,369 --> 00:48:48,029
producing Tomatoes but this cannabis

1273
00:48:46,110 --> 00:48:50,780
business is also boosting their sales

1274
00:48:48,030 --> 00:48:53,430
ridiculously so a grow store a head shop

1275
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:55,830
most of the dispensaries have smoking

1276
00:48:53,429 --> 00:48:57,449
gear they have dab rigs they have bongs

1277
00:48:55,829 --> 00:48:59,369
they have pipes they have papers but

1278
00:48:57,449 --> 00:49:01,889
it's grossly overpriced in that son of a

1279
00:48:59,369 --> 00:49:03,509
[ __ ] if you open up a head shop down

1280
00:49:01,889 --> 00:49:06,000
the street from a dispensary and sold

1281
00:49:03,510 --> 00:49:08,220
things in a decent markup you would make

1282
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,440
money because people will know that this

1283
00:49:08,219 --> 00:49:12,959
dispensary charges me good price for

1284
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:14,639
weed ridiculous prices for glass I'm

1285
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:17,340
gonna go to the glass shop and buy my

1286
00:49:14,639 --> 00:49:19,279
smoking accessories there somebody just

1287
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:21,420
wrote on periscope they said security

1288
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:23,160
security guards are always needed at the

1289
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:25,740
dispensaries we need security guards for

1290
00:49:23,159 --> 00:49:28,980
our drawers for the dispensaries for all

1291
00:49:25,739 --> 00:49:30,809
of our businesses packaging if you know

1292
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:33,119
how to make packaging if you can design

1293
00:49:30,809 --> 00:49:34,920
packaging if you are a packaging person

1294
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:37,500
that sort of stuff is needed in our

1295
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:40,170
industry something that people overlook

1296
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:43,320
is clothing people cannabis clothing

1297
00:49:40,170 --> 00:49:45,480
locally aimed cannabis clothing sells if

1298
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:47,550
you've got your state if you can make

1299
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:49,380
your state flag into something Colorado

1300
00:49:47,550 --> 00:49:52,230
a kind of cannabis e then that will sell

1301
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:53,910
in your area Web Design all of the

1302
00:49:52,230 --> 00:49:55,530
dispensaries need some sort of web

1303
00:49:53,909 --> 00:49:57,539
design something that Colorado

1304
00:49:55,530 --> 00:49:59,820
specializes in we have something called

1305
00:49:57,539 --> 00:50:01,500
a compliance specialist if you run a

1306
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:03,750
dispensary or work in a dispensary or

1307
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:05,610
own a dispensary everything has to be

1308
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:07,650
done under a certain set of rules that

1309
00:50:05,610 --> 00:50:10,380
are set by the meed you need one or two

1310
00:50:07,650 --> 00:50:11,670
people that know all of those rules and

1311
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:13,829
if you ask them a question it's their

1312
00:50:11,670 --> 00:50:15,389
job to go in the office and get the book

1313
00:50:13,829 --> 00:50:17,670
and figure out that rule that's your

1314
00:50:15,389 --> 00:50:19,230
compliance specialist and he needs to be

1315
00:50:17,670 --> 00:50:22,349
finding out all the new rules as they

1316
00:50:19,230 --> 00:50:24,269
come out he needs to be walking through

1317
00:50:22,349 --> 00:50:25,860
the grow through the sales area through

1318
00:50:24,269 --> 00:50:27,750
all of the dispensary and making sure

1319
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:29,700
that everything is under compliance so

1320
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:31,260
that if the inspectors come in you are

1321
00:50:29,699 --> 00:50:31,769
cool and legit and he keeps you out of

1322
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:33,810
trouble

1323
00:50:31,769 --> 00:50:37,619
so the dispensaries need assistance from

1324
00:50:33,809 --> 00:50:39,690
everywhere I'm also a taxi service of

1325
00:50:37,619 --> 00:50:41,400
some sort would be really cool or if you

1326
00:50:39,690 --> 00:50:43,420
can open this is the obvious one if you

1327
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:44,980
can open a smoking Club

1328
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:46,650
be cool as [ __ ] but the rules are always

1329
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:49,568
gonna be strict for that sort of stuff

1330
00:50:46,650 --> 00:50:51,670
what I have seen is a lot of smoking

1331
00:50:49,568 --> 00:50:53,139
buses they have the cannabis tour bus

1332
00:50:51,670 --> 00:50:54,338
because it's a little bit different I

1333
00:50:53,139 --> 00:50:56,828
don't know the rules on it you'd have to

1334
00:50:54,338 --> 00:50:58,480
find out that in your area but a taxi

1335
00:50:56,829 --> 00:51:00,430
service of some sort would be really

1336
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:02,858
cool transportation for intoxicated

1337
00:51:00,429 --> 00:51:06,279
people makes you look good and it's a

1338
00:51:02,858 --> 00:51:08,500
good business there's a service around

1339
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:10,900
here that actually hires specifically

1340
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:12,489
for dispensaries it's a temp agency and

1341
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:13,780
you go and apply and you have to get

1342
00:51:12,489 --> 00:51:15,519
your med badge and once you've got your

1343
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:17,798
med badge they send you to a dispensary

1344
00:51:15,519 --> 00:51:19,568
and you work there and it could lead to

1345
00:51:17,798 --> 00:51:22,000
permanent employment just like a normal

1346
00:51:19,568 --> 00:51:24,429
job at a normal temptation see and they

1347
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,139
are designed specifically for the

1348
00:51:24,429 --> 00:51:28,989
cannabis industry so you can open your

1349
00:51:26,139 --> 00:51:31,088
own temp agency to hire people for the

1350
00:51:28,989 --> 00:51:32,679
dispensaries so the dispensary owners

1351
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:34,808
and managers don't have to spend their

1352
00:51:32,679 --> 00:51:37,328
day interviewing people they pay you to

1353
00:51:34,809 --> 00:51:39,700
do that you send these people to the

1354
00:51:37,329 --> 00:51:41,289
dispensary they work they get paid a

1355
00:51:39,699 --> 00:51:43,419
certain amount of money and then you

1356
00:51:41,289 --> 00:51:45,039
take $1 whatever you know you make sure

1357
00:51:43,420 --> 00:51:46,930
that they get paid minimum wage but then

1358
00:51:45,039 --> 00:51:49,088
you take $1 a portion of whatever they

1359
00:51:46,929 --> 00:51:51,548
get paid to make your business work so

1360
00:51:49,088 --> 00:51:54,029
that happens around here like I said

1361
00:51:51,548 --> 00:51:56,440
they're being need for lodging hotels

1362
00:51:54,030 --> 00:51:58,000
hotels will be serious when cannabis

1363
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:59,950
goes recreational in your area because

1364
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,568
people will be coming from afar to the

1365
00:51:59,949 --> 00:52:03,789
nearest dispensaries to get cannabis

1366
00:52:01,568 --> 00:52:05,608
like we get people we're in Colorado we

1367
00:52:03,789 --> 00:52:08,469
get people from Texas Wyoming

1368
00:52:05,608 --> 00:52:10,239
Oklahoma they come from all over to get

1369
00:52:08,469 --> 00:52:11,679
weed from us here they're filling up the

1370
00:52:10,239 --> 00:52:13,899
hotels they'll come take weekend trips

1371
00:52:11,679 --> 00:52:16,480
just to buy weed all over and they'll

1372
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:18,400
have to stay in a hotel somewhere let's

1373
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:19,599
see so that's a lot of things that you

1374
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,858
guys could those are business

1375
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:22,990
opportunities that you could take

1376
00:52:20,858 --> 00:52:25,119
advantage of if you could open somewhere

1377
00:52:22,989 --> 00:52:26,858
to actually consume cannabis in your

1378
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:29,200
area that would be ideal because here

1379
00:52:26,858 --> 00:52:30,759
you can buy weed at 13 different places

1380
00:52:29,199 --> 00:52:32,469
within ten miles of each other but

1381
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:34,050
there's nowhere to legally consume your

1382
00:52:32,469 --> 00:52:37,119
cannabis

1383
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:39,490
all right so that's a big-ass list of

1384
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:41,769
ancillary and niche businesses that you

1385
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:43,089
could participate in without opening up

1386
00:52:41,769 --> 00:52:45,039
your own cannabis but you could still

1387
00:52:43,090 --> 00:52:47,829
capitalize on this cannabis industry

1388
00:52:45,039 --> 00:52:49,329
also there's those little hippie stores

1389
00:52:47,829 --> 00:52:51,159
that sell like hippie clothing like

1390
00:52:49,329 --> 00:52:53,319
patchwork pants and tie-dyed t-shirts

1391
00:52:51,159 --> 00:52:55,239
and [ __ ] hemp jewelry and all that

1392
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:56,440
kind of [ __ ] I think if you open one of

1393
00:52:55,239 --> 00:52:58,750
those near a dispensary and you

1394
00:52:56,440 --> 00:53:00,849
capitalize on a cannabis theme and like

1395
00:52:58,750 --> 00:53:03,190
I said earlier if you use your state or

1396
00:53:00,849 --> 00:53:05,799
your city and weed out your slogan like

1397
00:53:03,190 --> 00:53:08,139
my logo friary genetics is the Colorado

1398
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:09,970
flag that's turned into the Rasta colors

1399
00:53:08,139 --> 00:53:11,139
and people don't even know about the

1400
00:53:09,969 --> 00:53:14,139
company when they see it and they're

1401
00:53:11,139 --> 00:53:16,420
like holy [ __ ] I love that shirt so that

1402
00:53:14,139 --> 00:53:18,849
would be a good way to take your state

1403
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:20,409
flag or your city logo or whatever and

1404
00:53:18,849 --> 00:53:22,179
turn it into some sort of cannabis

1405
00:53:20,409 --> 00:53:24,789
themed to flag and make a spoof of it

1406
00:53:22,179 --> 00:53:26,500
and sell that in your store in your area

1407
00:53:24,789 --> 00:53:28,630
that would that would sell that would

1408
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:29,949
crush but all right I've gone on a long

1409
00:53:28,630 --> 00:53:31,210
time about this subject I'm gonna take a

1410
00:53:29,949 --> 00:53:34,299
drink of root beer and then we're going

1411
00:53:31,210 --> 00:53:35,500
to actually check it out we have been on

1412
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:36,880
periscope the entire time I've been

1413
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:38,530
recording and I told those people on

1414
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:40,690
periscope that we would take questions I

1415
00:53:38,530 --> 00:53:42,850
see that we have 17 people on periscope

1416
00:53:40,690 --> 00:53:44,920
right now we've got I'd like to go about

1417
00:53:42,849 --> 00:53:46,929
9 or 8 more minutes in this podcast so

1418
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:48,760
if periscope has got any questions for

1419
00:53:46,929 --> 00:53:51,549
me please type in your questions while I

1420
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:53,410
take a drink and I will read my favorite

1421
00:53:51,550 --> 00:53:55,060
questions and then I'll try to answer

1422
00:53:53,409 --> 00:53:56,289
them the best that I can for you so

1423
00:53:55,059 --> 00:53:57,849
while I take a drink you guys start

1424
00:53:56,289 --> 00:54:00,210
typing your questions there on periscope

1425
00:53:57,849 --> 00:54:00,210
for me

1426
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:10,429
all right that's funny because usually

1427
00:54:08,838 --> 00:54:11,659
periscope is filled with questions and

1428
00:54:10,429 --> 00:54:13,669
now they seem like they are stumped

1429
00:54:11,659 --> 00:54:15,710
earlier on periscope somebody asked me

1430
00:54:13,670 --> 00:54:19,880
what is the difference between wax and

1431
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:21,710
shatter so basically I am NOT the hash

1432
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:23,269
maker here this is my experience from

1433
00:54:21,710 --> 00:54:26,000
watching and hearing my hash maker

1434
00:54:23,268 --> 00:54:30,889
friends talk the difference between wax

1435
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:32,018
and shatter most vho okay somebody asked

1436
00:54:30,889 --> 00:54:33,980
me a question there I'm gonna write it

1437
00:54:32,018 --> 00:54:35,419
I'm writing it down how do you feel

1438
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:37,608
about smoking and driving we're gonna

1439
00:54:35,420 --> 00:54:39,349
ask that no we're gonna answer that in a

1440
00:54:37,608 --> 00:54:42,348
second I'm writing it down

1441
00:54:39,349 --> 00:54:44,539
smoke and drive all right but I was

1442
00:54:42,349 --> 00:54:46,068
answering the first question huh what's

1443
00:54:44,539 --> 00:54:48,349
the difference between wax and shatter

1444
00:54:46,068 --> 00:54:50,599
basically when you make pho if it's done

1445
00:54:48,349 --> 00:54:52,609
right they'll both come out very near

1446
00:54:50,599 --> 00:54:54,619
when it's done right it'll come out very

1447
00:54:52,608 --> 00:54:57,679
near shatter the consistency will be

1448
00:54:54,619 --> 00:54:59,630
very near shatter if not sappy so at

1449
00:54:57,679 --> 00:55:01,399
this point if you vacuum purge it

1450
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:04,278
properly and don't mess with it too much

1451
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:06,889
it will stay shatter it will come out

1452
00:55:04,278 --> 00:55:08,268
shatter is more like sorry I'm burping

1453
00:55:06,889 --> 00:55:09,828
after my drink shatter is like a jolly

1454
00:55:08,268 --> 00:55:12,078
rancher consistency where it's kind of

1455
00:55:09,829 --> 00:55:13,278
snappy it'll break that's why we call it

1456
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:15,259
shatter it's like a little piece of

1457
00:55:13,278 --> 00:55:16,190
glass if you chip it a chip at it too

1458
00:55:15,259 --> 00:55:19,880
hard it'll shatter

1459
00:55:16,190 --> 00:55:22,130
so most hash most BHO ran properly will

1460
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:24,798
turn into shatter now the way that you

1461
00:55:22,130 --> 00:55:27,439
make it into wax is right before it's

1462
00:55:24,798 --> 00:55:29,728
done right before it cools

1463
00:55:27,438 --> 00:55:31,078
how tights the open container law I

1464
00:55:29,728 --> 00:55:32,639
don't know somebody asked me a question

1465
00:55:31,079 --> 00:55:34,798
on periscope that said how tights the

1466
00:55:32,639 --> 00:55:36,328
open container laws I'm not experienced

1467
00:55:34,798 --> 00:55:38,429
with that in my area they don't give a

1468
00:55:36,329 --> 00:55:40,140
[ __ ] but in some areas they really do so

1469
00:55:38,429 --> 00:55:42,119
let me continue with my hash for my

1470
00:55:40,139 --> 00:55:43,708
shatter versus wax part so now we've got

1471
00:55:42,119 --> 00:55:47,068
this shatter right it's hard it's stable

1472
00:55:43,708 --> 00:55:49,889
now you could turn that into wax by

1473
00:55:47,068 --> 00:55:51,869
heating it or before you even let it

1474
00:55:49,889 --> 00:55:53,908
warm just keep it warm free let it cool

1475
00:55:51,869 --> 00:55:55,709
keep it warm and what you do is whip it

1476
00:55:53,909 --> 00:55:58,619
and I don't know what they used to whip

1477
00:55:55,708 --> 00:56:01,528
it I've seen a few things like I saw one

1478
00:55:58,619 --> 00:56:03,778
guy use a metal pick like for your afro

1479
00:56:01,528 --> 00:56:05,309
because it had four or five little

1480
00:56:03,778 --> 00:56:06,869
fingers coming off of it I guess their

1481
00:56:05,309 --> 00:56:09,239
teeth if they're on the pick but he

1482
00:56:06,869 --> 00:56:11,818
would put that in the pyrex dish of hash

1483
00:56:09,239 --> 00:56:14,009
and just stir it around really rapidly

1484
00:56:11,818 --> 00:56:16,168
and what he was trying to do is whip it

1485
00:56:14,009 --> 00:56:17,668
like it was like he was stirring some

1486
00:56:16,168 --> 00:56:19,889
kind of food and trying to put air into

1487
00:56:17,668 --> 00:56:21,449
it and make it fluffy and so what that

1488
00:56:19,889 --> 00:56:23,429
does is that fluffs it up and then when

1489
00:56:21,449 --> 00:56:25,079
it dries there's air trapped in there

1490
00:56:23,429 --> 00:56:26,548
and it just dries up a little bit

1491
00:56:25,079 --> 00:56:28,949
differently I don't know the science

1492
00:56:26,548 --> 00:56:32,309
behind why but it makes it waxy and it's

1493
00:56:28,949 --> 00:56:33,749
a little bit easier to handle um then

1494
00:56:32,309 --> 00:56:36,059
they put that in the back of and just

1495
00:56:33,748 --> 00:56:37,738
like they do the the shatter and they

1496
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:39,149
clean it up so I know that's not the

1497
00:56:37,739 --> 00:56:40,949
most technical answer but the main

1498
00:56:39,148 --> 00:56:43,259
difference between wax and shatter is

1499
00:56:40,949 --> 00:56:45,449
the whipping action that happens right

1500
00:56:43,259 --> 00:56:46,679
before it's finished you just whip it up

1501
00:56:45,449 --> 00:56:50,009
and put a little bit of air in it and it

1502
00:56:46,679 --> 00:56:51,959
makes a little bit fluffy somebody on

1503
00:56:50,009 --> 00:56:55,108
periscope says keep the vacuum 1:20 and

1504
00:56:51,958 --> 00:56:56,668
it will bubble yeah but 120 is a little

1505
00:56:55,108 --> 00:56:58,858
high that's when you start burning off

1506
00:56:56,668 --> 00:57:00,778
chirps is about 106 110 ish

1507
00:56:58,858 --> 00:57:02,998
all right so somebody asked me how I

1508
00:57:00,778 --> 00:57:05,489
feel about smoking and driving it's a

1509
00:57:02,998 --> 00:57:09,538
really good question I cannot advocate

1510
00:57:05,489 --> 00:57:11,278
you smoking cannabis and driving I can't

1511
00:57:09,539 --> 00:57:12,778
say to do that but again I can't be a

1512
00:57:11,278 --> 00:57:15,809
hypocrite because I do it myself

1513
00:57:12,778 --> 00:57:18,119
occasionally how I feel about it is if

1514
00:57:15,809 --> 00:57:19,969
you know your limits and you're not

1515
00:57:18,119 --> 00:57:23,429
gonna be a [ __ ] out there on the road

1516
00:57:19,969 --> 00:57:25,409
and you're not [ __ ] up drive if you've

1517
00:57:23,429 --> 00:57:27,239
had a little bit to smoke but if you're

1518
00:57:25,409 --> 00:57:29,249
the kind of person that smokes and goes

1519
00:57:27,239 --> 00:57:31,949
[ __ ] full [ __ ] don't get behind

1520
00:57:29,248 --> 00:57:33,629
the wheel know your limitations check

1521
00:57:31,949 --> 00:57:35,188
yourself before you hurt somebody or

1522
00:57:33,630 --> 00:57:37,318
yourself that's why that's how I really

1523
00:57:35,188 --> 00:57:38,728
feel about it I would be a hypocrite if

1524
00:57:37,318 --> 00:57:39,699
I came on here and I said don't take

1525
00:57:38,728 --> 00:57:42,019
dabs and

1526
00:57:39,699 --> 00:57:44,569
maybe don't take drag dabs and drive

1527
00:57:42,019 --> 00:57:47,030
simultaneously try not to smoke in the

1528
00:57:44,570 --> 00:57:49,430
car just don't be that [ __ ] seek

1529
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:51,260
about there's a news article about you

1530
00:57:49,429 --> 00:57:53,299
when you [ __ ] up in the future check out

1531
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:55,070
what you're doing and see huh I am I'm

1532
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:57,200
about to be a news story you know what I

1533
00:57:55,070 --> 00:57:59,150
mean like if I crash into somebody right

1534
00:57:57,199 --> 00:58:01,039
now while I'm smoking this bong in the

1535
00:57:59,150 --> 00:58:02,420
car I'm going to be on the news I'm

1536
00:58:01,039 --> 00:58:03,710
gonna look like an [ __ ] I'm gonna be

1537
00:58:02,420 --> 00:58:05,630
a black eye for the cannabis community

1538
00:58:03,710 --> 00:58:07,970
or I don't wanna get pulled over while

1539
00:58:05,630 --> 00:58:09,800
I'm taking this dab let's think about

1540
00:58:07,969 --> 00:58:11,209
that kind of [ __ ] but if you want to get

1541
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:13,130
blazed before you drive and you can

1542
00:58:11,210 --> 00:58:15,800
handle it and you're not an idiot that's

1543
00:58:13,130 --> 00:58:17,300
your thing do that don't drink a drop of

1544
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:18,860
alcohol and drive because I'm a

1545
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:20,690
hypocrite maybe but I feel alcohol

1546
00:58:18,860 --> 00:58:22,579
really [ __ ] with your equilibrium your

1547
00:58:20,690 --> 00:58:24,349
balance your depth of perception it

1548
00:58:22,579 --> 00:58:26,269
really [ __ ] you up but if you're a

1549
00:58:24,349 --> 00:58:28,730
medical marijuana consumer you're

1550
00:58:26,269 --> 00:58:30,739
probably you've got a tolerance you're

1551
00:58:28,730 --> 00:58:32,570
experienced and you're not smoking it

1552
00:58:30,739 --> 00:58:34,519
just to get [ __ ] high if you're

1553
00:58:32,570 --> 00:58:36,470
smoking just to get [ __ ] high don't

1554
00:58:34,519 --> 00:58:38,449
drive chill out for a little bit let

1555
00:58:36,469 --> 00:58:40,099
somebody drive for you call an uber do

1556
00:58:38,449 --> 00:58:42,230
whatever you got to do that's my opinion

1557
00:58:40,099 --> 00:58:43,819
on that all right periscope you have one

1558
00:58:42,230 --> 00:58:46,130
more question for me it'd be perfect to

1559
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:47,420
get one more question in and on

1560
00:58:46,130 --> 00:58:48,890
periscope they're sending me a bunch of

1561
00:58:47,420 --> 00:58:50,659
Hearts which means they got love for me

1562
00:58:48,889 --> 00:58:52,489
it's technically illegal is it

1563
00:58:50,659 --> 00:58:54,069
technically illegal to drive hi yes it

1564
00:58:52,489 --> 00:58:56,239
is technically illegal to drive hi

1565
00:58:54,070 --> 00:58:58,130
that's driving under the influence of

1566
00:58:56,239 --> 00:58:59,989
drugs or driving with ability impaired

1567
00:58:58,130 --> 00:59:01,160
depending on how they book you or how

1568
00:58:59,989 --> 00:59:02,959
they write it down or whatever I don't

1569
00:59:01,159 --> 00:59:04,879
know what the difference would be but it

1570
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:07,039
is absolutely illegal to drive while

1571
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:09,490
you're high and it's definitely looked

1572
00:59:07,039 --> 00:59:09,489
down upon

1573
00:59:10,179 --> 00:59:15,259
DUI somebody on periscope says DUI it's

1574
00:59:13,820 --> 00:59:16,640
driving under the influence so yeah

1575
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:19,190
don't don't be high when you're driving

1576
00:59:16,639 --> 00:59:21,199
and if the cops ask you how long ago you

1577
00:59:19,190 --> 00:59:23,539
smoked say six hours ago be like it's

1578
00:59:21,199 --> 00:59:25,159
been at least six hours ago unless you

1579
00:59:23,539 --> 00:59:26,539
but if you're smoking a joint in the car

1580
00:59:25,159 --> 00:59:29,869
if you got a blunt burnin that's no

1581
00:59:26,539 --> 00:59:31,190
excuse all right I'm wait for periscope

1582
00:59:29,869 --> 00:59:32,480
it's throw-up one more question if they

1583
00:59:31,190 --> 00:59:35,900
don't throw up one more question we will

1584

1619
01:00:53,389 --> 01:00:58,759
favorite part of my job is helping other

1620
01:00:56,929 --> 01:01:02,059
people out and seeing the positive

1621
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:06,170
affect that the work I do has on other

1622
01:01:02,059 --> 01:01:10,460
people's lives because honestly I grow

1623
01:01:06,170 --> 01:01:12,170
weed and I'm a dad and play on Instagram

1624
01:01:10,460 --> 01:01:13,429
and I plan on periscope and it feels

1625
01:01:12,170 --> 01:01:15,740
like I'm just playing I'm a big man

1626
01:01:13,429 --> 01:01:17,119
child because my job is what I love so

1627
01:01:15,739 --> 01:01:19,279
it doesn't feel like I'm working and

1628
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:20,389
that right there maybe my favorite part

1629
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:21,110
of it it doesn't feel like I'm working

1630
01:01:20,389 --> 01:01:24,670
ever

1631
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:27,010
I'll be completely sweaty

1632
01:01:24,670 --> 01:01:29,349
um that's a good question but I'm

1633
01:01:27,010 --> 01:01:32,290
probably not gonna get to that one text

1634
01:01:29,349 --> 01:01:35,619
that to me on on Twitter and I'll answer

1635
01:01:32,289 --> 01:01:37,119
that and yes I do play the drums so I do

1636
01:01:35,619 --> 01:01:38,530
a lot of things and I think my favorite

1637
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:40,510
part of my job is seeing people happy

1638
01:01:38,530 --> 01:01:42,940
like I've got a patient named Doug he's

1639
01:01:40,510 --> 01:01:44,799
a 60 year old guy and he feels like [ __ ]

1640
01:01:42,940 --> 01:01:46,750
half the time and I grow cannabis did I

1641
01:01:44,798 --> 01:01:48,309
know he loves and I go to his house and

1642
01:01:46,750 --> 01:01:49,659
I roll up a big fat joint where I give

1643
01:01:48,309 --> 01:01:51,670
him a DAB and I'm like hey Doug let's

1644
01:01:49,659 --> 01:01:53,500
hang out and smoke this and when I get

1645
01:01:51,670 --> 01:01:55,389
there he's hurt or sick and depressed

1646
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:56,858
and he's got a shitty look on his face

1647
01:01:55,389 --> 01:01:58,719
and by the time I leave the dude's got a

1648
01:01:56,858 --> 01:02:01,210
smile on his face and he loves the world

1649
01:01:58,719 --> 01:02:03,009
and he loves life again and part of that

1650
01:02:01,210 --> 01:02:04,869
is my interaction with the guy but a

1651
01:02:03,010 --> 01:02:06,849
large portion of that is the cannabis

1652
01:02:04,869 --> 01:02:08,950
plant and a large portion of that is the

1653
01:02:06,849 --> 01:02:10,990
cannabis that I drew from my heart and

1654
01:02:08,949 --> 01:02:13,149
gave to this old guy to feel better so

1655
01:02:10,989 --> 01:02:14,858
that's probably the favorite part of my

1656
01:02:13,150 --> 01:02:16,059
job is that I get I'm healing people

1657
01:02:14,858 --> 01:02:18,250
even the people that are smoking

1658
01:02:16,059 --> 01:02:21,548
cannabis recreationally it's healing it

1659
01:02:18,250 --> 01:02:23,409
feels better to take a fat puff of ganja

1660
01:02:21,548 --> 01:02:25,119
and blow out that smoke and just feel

1661
01:02:23,409 --> 01:02:27,730
better so I get to do that to people

1662
01:02:25,119 --> 01:02:29,619
every day I get to see that it is all in

1663
01:02:27,730 --> 01:02:31,389
the love that's absolutely correct so

1664
01:02:29,619 --> 01:02:33,039
somebody asked me what's my favorite

1665
01:02:31,389 --> 01:02:35,289
part I think that is it I get to see

1666
01:02:33,039 --> 01:02:36,818
people improve their lives with from my

1667
01:02:35,289 --> 01:02:40,000
work and that makes me feel [ __ ]

1668
01:02:36,818 --> 01:02:41,679
golden inside somebody asked me about an

1669
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:44,079
open container law here in Colorado

1670
01:02:41,679 --> 01:02:47,500
we've we've started treating cannabis

1671
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:48,339
like alcohol is our new model here so

1672
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:50,889
we've got what's called the open

1673
01:02:48,338 --> 01:02:52,539
container law unfortunately I am NOT up

1674
01:02:50,889 --> 01:02:54,670
to date on the open container law I

1675
01:02:52,539 --> 01:02:56,798
don't know enough about it in my city

1676
01:02:54,670 --> 01:02:58,780
you can drive around with your dad right

1677
01:02:56,798 --> 01:03:00,460
on the dash my city is a little bit

1678
01:02:58,780 --> 01:03:01,329
gangster and nobody cares what you're

1679
01:03:00,460 --> 01:03:03,000
doing here as long as you're not

1680
01:03:01,329 --> 01:03:05,619
shooting at each other when you drive by

1681
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:07,510
in other places you've got to have your

1682
01:03:05,619 --> 01:03:09,460
stuff in a childproof container or a

1683
01:03:07,510 --> 01:03:11,049
sealed container in your vehicle and

1684
01:03:09,460 --> 01:03:13,780
it's got to be out of your reach and in

1685
01:03:11,048 --> 01:03:15,548
the trunk I think but my vehicle doesn't

1686
01:03:13,780 --> 01:03:18,190
have a trunk so I put it in my backpack

1687
01:03:15,548 --> 01:03:20,889
and then I put it in the backseat

1688
01:03:18,190 --> 01:03:22,429
but quite often honestly there's a dad

1689
01:03:20,889 --> 01:03:24,199
rig in my center console

1690
01:03:22,429 --> 01:03:26,509
but if I'm driving from here to revise

1691
01:03:24,199 --> 01:03:27,919
house what am I gonna do I just put the

1692
01:03:26,510 --> 01:03:29,990
dad brake in the center console until my

1693
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:31,550
hash like carb cap my torch in there and

1694
01:03:29,989 --> 01:03:33,289
I Drive over to hazel and I carry the

1695
01:03:31,550 --> 01:03:35,839
house and I take a couple dabs so

1696
01:03:33,289 --> 01:03:38,300
honestly I don't know enough about that

1697
01:03:35,838 --> 01:03:39,858
open container law to be useful and I'm

1698
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:45,380
not a lawyer so don't follow my advice

1699
01:03:39,858 --> 01:03:48,828

1739
01:05:04,429 --> 01:05:08,989
application filled out get yourself a

1740
01:05:06,108 --> 01:05:12,259
badge then the thing to do is hit every

1741
01:05:08,989 --> 01:05:14,209
dispensary you can with a resume and

1742
01:05:12,260 --> 01:05:15,470
explain to them why you're the employee

1743
01:05:14,210 --> 01:05:16,670
that they want and if you're not

1744
01:05:15,469 --> 01:05:18,679
experienced in the cannabis industry

1745
01:05:16,670 --> 01:05:20,409
here in Colorado it's going to be

1746
01:05:18,679 --> 01:05:24,259
difficult getting your foot in the door

1747
01:05:20,409 --> 01:05:25,338
because the dispensaries are full people

1748
01:05:24,260 --> 01:05:28,910
have been employed there for quite a

1749
01:05:25,338 --> 01:05:30,500
while I don't know if you can get into

1750
01:05:28,909 --> 01:05:32,568
the cannabis industry with marijuana and

1751
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:35,088
misdemeanors I really do not know that I

1752
01:05:32,568 --> 01:05:36,588
don't know sorry I apologize I don't

1753
01:05:35,088 --> 01:05:37,818
have that right on hand if I would have

1754
01:05:36,588 --> 01:05:38,838
prepared that question out of researched

1755
01:05:37,818 --> 01:05:40,429
it for you but since we're doing it

1756
01:05:38,838 --> 01:05:42,858
right off right off the cuff here I'm

1757
01:05:40,429 --> 01:05:43,909
not sure but so you get your badge and

1758
01:05:42,858 --> 01:05:45,679
then you come here and then you apply

1759
01:05:43,909 --> 01:05:47,210
and then hopefully you get somebody's

1760
01:05:45,679 --> 01:05:49,279
attention and you're probably gonna have

1761
01:05:47,210 --> 01:05:51,380
to start by being like a trimmer or a

1762
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:55,369
budtender or something like that

1763
01:05:51,380 --> 01:05:56,630
so I would learn how to trim weed is

1764
01:05:55,369 --> 01:05:58,250
probably where you're gonna start

1765
01:05:56,630 --> 01:05:59,960
because unless you're a master grower

1766
01:05:58,250 --> 01:06:01,818
and you can prove it nobody's gonna let

1767
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:02,929
you start off being a master grower it's

1768
01:06:01,818 --> 01:06:05,750
not gonna happen you're gonna be an

1769
01:06:02,929 --> 01:06:08,629
hourly trimmer so work on your resume

1770
01:06:05,750 --> 01:06:11,358
start learning how to trim weed learn

1771
01:06:08,630 --> 01:06:13,490
how to be chipper draw some boobs I hate

1772
01:06:11,358 --> 01:06:14,929
to say it but dispensaries will hire you

1773
01:06:13,489 --> 01:06:17,929
if you have got some boobs

1774
01:06:14,929 --> 01:06:19,578
very cute 20 to 25 year old chick and

1775
01:06:17,929 --> 01:06:21,048
you can flirt with the customers and you

01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:34,570
bit I got to see who else who would you

1949
01:15:32,859 --> 01:15:36,460
guess right you know me I got to see mr.

1950
01:15:34,569 --> 01:15:37,349
Doug Benson at Comedy Works in Denver

1951
01:15:36,460 --> 01:15:39,029
Doug wasn't

1952
01:15:37,350 --> 01:15:41,460
he did another stand-up comedy show and

1953
01:15:39,029 --> 01:15:44,279
I gotta tell you he really redeemed

1954
01:15:41,460 --> 01:15:46,649
himself from the last show that I saw if

1955
01:15:44,279 --> 01:15:49,170
you listen to this podcast regularly you

1956
01:15:46,649 --> 01:15:51,539
know that I kind of bashed Doug Benson's

1957
01:15:49,170 --> 01:15:54,899
last performance at Comedy Works and I

1958
01:15:51,539 --> 01:15:56,640
also kind of bashed his album he did a

1959
01:15:54,899 --> 01:15:58,289
much better performance this time he had

1960
01:15:56,640 --> 01:15:59,730
a little bit of a cough which may have

1961
01:15:58,289 --> 01:16:01,409
worked to our advantage

1962
01:15:59,729 --> 01:16:02,579
Doug wasn't smoking as heavily because

1963
01:16:01,409 --> 01:16:04,889
he was a little bit under the weather

1964
01:16:02,579 --> 01:16:08,220
and I think he led to him having a

1965
01:16:04,890 --> 01:16:11,400
better performance um Doug did make a

1966
01:16:08,220 --> 01:16:13,530
comment actually Doug walked out on

1967
01:16:11,399 --> 01:16:15,599
stage and the first thing Doug said was

1968
01:16:13,529 --> 01:16:18,149
hey you know it's a Doug Benson show

1969
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:19,110
because Rasta Jeff is here and of course

1970
01:16:18,149 --> 01:16:21,539
I was sitting right in the front row

1971
01:16:19,109 --> 01:16:23,250
I've got those two VIP seats always so

1972
01:16:21,539 --> 01:16:24,989
that was kind of neat but then he

1973
01:16:23,250 --> 01:16:26,819
started talking a little bit and he

1974
01:16:24,989 --> 01:16:28,319
pulled out a handful of notes and he

1975
01:16:26,819 --> 01:16:29,789
said well I got my jokes heard on my

1976
01:16:28,319 --> 01:16:32,099
pocket and he looked me straight in the

1977
01:16:29,789 --> 01:16:33,899
face and he said Rasta Jeff knows what

1978
01:16:32,100 --> 01:16:35,730
I'm talking about

1979
01:16:33,899 --> 01:16:37,859
if you guys listen to this podcast I

1980
01:16:35,729 --> 01:16:40,500
called Doug out on his pocket full of

1981
01:16:37,859 --> 01:16:43,309
disheveled notes on another episode I'm

1982
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:45,539
wondering if Doug listens to the podcast

1983
01:16:43,310 --> 01:16:47,550
I'm not sure but Doug if you're

1984
01:16:45,539 --> 01:16:49,319
listening dude great show thanks for a

1985
01:16:47,550 --> 01:16:50,730
great time I hope you're getting over

1986
01:16:49,319 --> 01:16:53,460
that cough and I've been watching your

1987
01:16:50,729 --> 01:16:55,500
periscope videos and they're great also

1988
01:16:53,460 --> 01:16:57,659
at Comedy Works that weekend are the

1989
01:16:55,500 --> 01:16:59,399
same day opening for Doug Benson was my

1990
01:16:57,659 --> 01:17:01,109
friend in guy o bellum if you don't know

1991
01:16:59,399 --> 01:17:04,829
and IOB l'm make sure you check him out

1992
01:17:01,109 --> 01:17:06,869
his name is spelled ng AI oh it's at and

1993
01:17:04,829 --> 01:17:08,159
guy o for 20 on Twitter

1994
01:17:06,869 --> 01:17:10,260
make sure you search him out and follow

1995
01:17:08,159 --> 01:17:12,059
him he's a really good dude had a lot of

1996
01:17:10,260 --> 01:17:13,619
fun he's a cannabis connoisseur like

1997
01:17:12,060 --> 01:17:17,070
myself so we have a lot of things to

1998
01:17:13,619 --> 01:17:18,569
talk about and we may hit a future

1999
01:17:17,069 --> 01:17:20,069
collaboration between the two of us

2000
01:17:18,569 --> 01:17:21,719
we'll talk too much about it but there

2001
01:17:20,069 --> 01:17:23,159
may be some stuff being talked about he

2002
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:24,480
does live in California I live in

2003
01:17:23,159 --> 01:17:26,970
Colorado there are a lot of things to

2004
01:17:24,479 --> 01:17:30,449
deal with there but we are going to try

2005
01:17:26,970 --> 01:17:33,260
and do some [ __ ] together I gotta say

2006
01:17:30,449 --> 01:17:36,569
and I'll crushed and die oh did probably

2007
01:17:33,260 --> 01:17:37,800
20 minutes maybe 30 it seems like he he

2008
01:17:36,569 --> 01:17:39,840
went on for a long time but he

2009
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:41,100
definitely tore it up had to be 15 or 20

2010
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:42,569
minutes cuz I'm sure he didn't do more

2011
01:17:41,100 --> 01:17:45,450
than more than that being an opening act

2012
01:17:42,569 --> 01:17:46,728
but he was on fire he made me laugh my

2013
01:17:45,449 --> 01:17:48,679
ass off

2014
01:17:46,729 --> 01:17:50,479
Doug Benson was equally hilarious but

2015
01:17:48,679 --> 01:17:54,170
I've seen Doug so many times that when

2016
01:17:50,479 --> 01:17:57,530
he starts into a vibe I know which jokes

2017
01:17:54,170 --> 01:17:58,998
are coming out of this clump of like

2018
01:17:57,529 --> 01:18:00,498
this part of the show is gonna be this

2019
01:17:58,998 --> 01:18:01,969
clump of jokes and then the vibe will

2020
01:18:00,498 --> 01:18:03,469
change cuz he's very interactive with

2021
01:18:01,969 --> 01:18:06,078
the crowd he does a lot of crowd work

2022
01:18:03,469 --> 01:18:07,670
but I know all of Doug's a joke so it's

2023
01:18:06,078 --> 01:18:10,549
a little predictable for me I go for the

2024
01:18:07,670 --> 01:18:12,139
fun I go for the smoke session before

2025
01:18:10,550 --> 01:18:12,769
and after of course cuz that's always a

2026
01:18:12,139 --> 01:18:14,748
good time

2027
01:18:12,769 --> 01:18:16,610

2046
01:18:55,189 --> 01:18:58,998
face plastered all over the damn place I

2047
01:18:57,319 --> 01:19:00,408
want to give a huge shout out to giddy

2048
01:18:58,998 --> 01:19:02,569
up and to sure

2049
01:19:00,408 --> 01:19:04,458
we've been if you guys follow the show

2050
01:19:02,569 --> 01:19:06,889
you've been hearing about the raid that

2051
01:19:04,458 --> 01:19:08,868
happened in Santa Ana California the

2052
01:19:06,889 --> 01:19:11,208
manager of that dispensary was in a

2053
01:19:08,868 --> 01:19:13,848
wheelchair and she was blind and she has

2054
01:19:11,208 --> 01:19:16,819
an amputated leg she has been getting a

2055
01:19:13,849 --> 01:19:18,860
lot of media coverage and recently was

2056
01:19:16,819 --> 01:19:20,179
discovered that her wheelchair was her

2057
01:19:18,859 --> 01:19:21,529
electric wheelchair it was kind of

2058
01:19:20,179 --> 01:19:25,550
falling apart and it was held together

2059
01:19:21,529 --> 01:19:27,439
mainly by duct tape well there were a

2060
01:19:25,550 --> 01:19:29,719
couple of people that thought that a

2061
01:19:27,439 --> 01:19:32,328
lady in her position deserved better

2062
01:19:29,719 --> 01:19:35,389
than a duct tape wheelchair so giddyup

2063
01:19:32,328 --> 01:19:38,118
from mo Tech and too short got together

2064
01:19:35,389 --> 01:19:40,519
and bought this lovely lady a brand new

2065
01:19:38,118 --> 01:19:42,828
wheelchair so I want to give a big huge

2066
01:19:40,519 --> 01:19:45,889
personal shout out to giddy up and to to

2067
01:19:42,828 --> 01:19:47,929
short that represents two industries

2068
01:19:45,889 --> 01:19:49,368
that are always looked down upon the rap

2069
01:19:47,929 --> 01:19:50,958
industry has always looked at like a

2070
01:19:49,368 --> 01:19:52,248
bunch of gangsters and the cannabis

2071
01:19:50,958 --> 01:19:54,380
industry has looked at like a bunch of

2072
01:19:52,248 --> 01:19:56,988
drug dealers but look what two of our

2073
01:19:54,380 --> 01:19:59,149
representatives did from what I read

2074
01:19:56,988 --> 01:20:01,448
that wheelchair was about $4,000

2075
01:19:59,149 --> 01:20:03,979
that's not pocket change for anybody so

2076
01:20:01,448 --> 01:20:05,868
that's a good deed done by our industry

2077
01:20:03,979 --> 01:20:06,800
and big shout-out to giddyup much

2078
01:20:05,868 --> 01:20:08,868
respect to giddyup

2079
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:11,269
I truly appreciate you that's really

2080
01:20:08,868 --> 01:20:13,038
cool giddy actually sent me my gmail

2081
01:20:11,269 --> 01:20:15,260
that I use and there's nothing like it

2082
01:20:13,038 --> 01:20:16,969
so do whatever you can to support emo

2083
01:20:15,260 --> 01:20:21,889
tech send them a thank you something

2084
01:20:16,969 --> 01:20:22,698
like that decide which one I want to

2085
01:20:21,889 --> 01:20:29,239
read first

2086
01:20:22,698 --> 01:20:30,738
they're both this one I was just

2087
01:20:29,238 --> 01:20:32,208
browsing through news sites and I came

2088
01:20:30,738 --> 01:20:33,799
across this and I thought that the world

2089
01:20:32,208 --> 01:20:36,288
would like to hear about this the

2090
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:39,829
headline says do medical marijuana users

2091
01:20:36,288 --> 01:20:42,228
have right to bear arms no says the ATF

2092
01:20:39,828 --> 01:20:44,148
and then it says there are no exceptions

2093
01:20:42,229 --> 01:20:46,878
in federal law for marijuana purportedly

2094
01:20:44,149 --> 01:20:49,610
used for medicinal purposes ATF official

says this article is by Matt volt and

2096
01:20:49,609 --> 01:20:54,609
it's from The Associated Press and it

2097
01:20:51,979 --> 01:20:57,168
goes like this it's from Helena Montana

2098
01:20:54,609 --> 01:20:58,998
it says firearms dealers and states that

2099
01:20:57,168 --> 01:21:00,889
allow medical marijuana can't sell guns

2100
01:20:58,998 --> 01:21:04,069
or ammunition to registered users of the

2101
01:21:00,889 --> 01:21:06,019
drug a policy that marijuana and gun

2102
01:21:04,069 --> 01:21:07,819
rights groups say deny second Amendment

2103
01:21:06,019 --> 01:21:10,489
rights to individuals who are following

2104
01:21:07,819 --> 01:21:12,198
state law federal law already makes it

2105
01:21:10,488 --> 01:21:14,658
illegal for someone to possess a gun if

2106
01:21:12,198 --> 01:21:16,248
he or she is an unlawful user of or

2107
01:21:14,658 --> 01:21:19,488
addicted to marijuana or other

2108
01:21:16,248 --> 01:21:20,868
controlled substances a September twenty

2109
01:21:19,488 --> 01:21:22,549
first letter from the Bureau of Alcohol

2110
01:21:20,868 --> 01:21:25,668
Tobacco and Firearms and Explosives

2111
01:21:22,550 --> 01:21:28,099
issued in response to numerous inquiries

2112
01:21:25,668 --> 01:21:30,128
from gun dealers clarifies that medical

2113
01:21:28,099 --> 01:21:32,929
marijuana patients are included in that

2114
01:21:30,128 --> 01:21:34,639
definition there are no exceptions in

2115
01:21:32,929 --> 01:21:37,099
federal law for marijuana purported

2116
01:21:34,639 --> 01:21:39,469
purportedly used for medicinal purposes

2117
01:21:37,099 --> 01:21:41,748
even if such use is sanctioned by state

2118
01:21:39,469 --> 01:21:43,578
law said the letter by Arthur Herber the

2119
01:21:41,748 --> 01:21:46,760
ATF's assistant director for enforcement

2120
01:21:43,578 --> 01:21:49,969
programs and services federal firearms

2121
01:21:46,760 --> 01:21:52,369
licensees or FFLs can't sell a gun to

2122
01:21:49,969 --> 01:21:54,319
someone who answers yes when requested

2123
01:21:52,368 --> 01:21:57,049
forms asked whether the buyer is a

2124
01:21:54,319 --> 01:21:59,809
controlled substance user

2125
01:21:57,050 --> 01:22:01,460
so that's kind of a tricky that's that's

2126
01:21:59,810 --> 01:22:03,080
[ __ ] right there all right I'm gonna

2127
01:22:01,460 --> 01:22:05,210
keep reading on reasonable cause to

2128
01:22:03,079 --> 01:22:06,769
believe this week's letter also says

2129
01:22:05,210 --> 01:22:08,270
that licensed dealers can't sell a gun

2130
01:22:06,770 --> 01:22:10,520
or ammunition if they have reasonable

2131
01:22:08,270 --> 01:22:12,500
cause to believe the buyer is using a

2132
01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:13,880
controlled substance that includes if

2133
01:22:12,500 --> 01:22:16,159
the buyer presents a medical marijuana

2134
01:22:13,880 --> 01:22:18,230
card as identification or if the buyer

2135
01:22:16,159 --> 01:22:19,909
talks about drug use having a medical

2136
01:22:18,229 --> 01:22:22,849
marijuana card or a recent drug

2137
01:22:19,909 --> 01:22:25,430
conviction ATF spokesman drew Wade said

2138
01:22:22,850 --> 01:22:27,230
Wednesday but there are no new

2139
01:22:25,430 --> 01:22:29,360
obligations for gun dealers outlined in

2140
01:22:27,229 --> 01:22:31,009
the letter Wade said we received lots of

2141
01:22:29,359 --> 01:22:32,299
queries from the industry from various

2142
01:22:31,010 --> 01:22:34,340
states of how to deal with the state

2143
01:22:32,300 --> 01:22:36,770
legislation and federal law he said is

2144
01:22:34,340 --> 01:22:39,440
our responsibility to provide guidance

2145
01:22:36,770 --> 01:22:41,570
advice and guidance the clash between

2146
01:22:39,439 --> 01:22:43,460
state and federal laws has led to

2147
01:22:41,569 --> 01:22:45,319
lawsuits and criminal cases in some of

2148
01:22:43,460 --> 01:22:47,930
the 16 states that have legalized

2149
01:22:45,319 --> 01:22:49,340
medical marijuana use officials in -

2150
01:22:47,930 --> 01:22:51,380
Oregon counties have said they'll appeal

2151
01:22:49,340 --> 01:22:52,940
the US Supreme Court after state judges

2152
01:22:51,380 --> 01:22:54,859
said sheriff's couldn't deny concealed

2153
01:22:52,939 --> 01:22:57,319
handgun licenses for medical marijuana

2154
01:22:54,859 --> 01:22:58,849
patients the Oregon Court of Appeals and

2155
01:22:57,319 --> 01:23:01,369
the Oregon Supreme Court said the state

2156
01:22:58,850 --> 01:23:02,900
law authorizes concealed handgun permits

2157
01:23:01,369 --> 01:23:05,659
in separate from the federal law that

2158
01:23:02,899 --> 01:23:07,279
outlaws gun possession by drug users and

2159
01:23:05,659 --> 01:23:10,220
the state gun law doesn't address

2160
01:23:07,279 --> 01:23:12,170
medical marijuana lose great use sorry

2161
01:23:10,220 --> 01:23:14,240
I'm reading ahead of myself here

2162
01:23:12,170 --> 01:23:16,220
the Montana raids federal authorities

2163
01:23:14,239 --> 01:23:18,710
also raided dozens of medical marijuana

2164
01:23:16,220 --> 01:23:20,720
operations across Montana this spring

2165
01:23:18,710 --> 01:23:22,579
chilling a once blooming pot industry

2166
01:23:20,720 --> 01:23:25,220
and leading to sweeping changes in

2167
01:23:22,579 --> 01:23:26,689
Montana laws the Department of Justin

2168
01:23:25,220 --> 01:23:28,220
followed up with a warning letter to

2169
01:23:26,689 --> 01:23:30,049
political leaders in many states that

2170
01:23:28,220 --> 01:23:31,820
federal prosecutors will pursue

2171
01:23:30,050 --> 01:23:33,409
marijuana distributors but not

2172
01:23:31,819 --> 01:23:36,500
individual patients who are following

2173
01:23:33,409 --> 01:23:38,149
state law the letter the ATF sent to gun

2174
01:23:36,500 --> 01:23:40,909
dealers last week was first reported by

2175
01:23:38,149 --> 01:23:42,109
Lee newspapers of Montana pro marijuana

2176
01:23:40,909 --> 01:23:44,899
and gun group said the policy

2177
01:23:42,109 --> 01:23:46,339
clarification amounts to rescinding the

2178
01:23:44,899 --> 01:23:48,319
gun rights for the thousands of people

2179
01:23:46,340 --> 01:23:51,350
licensed to use medical marijuana laws

2180
01:23:48,319 --> 01:23:53,179
and it appears to contradict the 2009

2181
01:23:51,350 --> 01:23:55,280
Department of Justice memo that said

2182
01:23:53,180 --> 01:23:57,110
Obama administration would not pursue

2183
01:23:55,279 --> 01:23:59,559
prosecution of individual medical

2184
01:23:57,109 --> 01:24:01,909
marijuana users who will base state laws

2185
01:23:59,560 --> 01:24:03,680
beside that the government is putting in

2186
01:24:01,909 --> 01:24:05,720
additional burden on gun dealers to

2187
01:24:03,680 --> 01:24:08,600
police their customers he said Montana

2188
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:10,260
said Montana shooting sports association

2189
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:12,570
Gary marbeth

2190
01:24:10,260 --> 01:24:14,579
their business is to be merchants not to

2191
01:24:12,569 --> 01:24:16,738
be cops unfortunately the federal

2192
01:24:14,578 --> 01:24:19,288
licensing scheme complicates that marbot

2193
01:24:16,738 --> 01:24:21,448
said it sounds as if the ATF is

2194
01:24:19,288 --> 01:24:24,389
expecting them to drift further into

2195
01:24:21,448 --> 01:24:25,649
that cop role could you imagine that you

2196
01:24:24,389 --> 01:24:27,090
guys know that if you're a gun sale

2197
01:24:25,649 --> 01:24:28,439
seller you don't have to just follow

2198
01:24:27,090 --> 01:24:29,849
that paper you actually have to like

2199
01:24:28,439 --> 01:24:31,919
talk to everybody and try to act like

2200
01:24:29,849 --> 01:24:34,078
you're the cops also and then there are

2201
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:36,000
gonna be a bunch of vigilantes they're

2202
01:24:34,078 --> 01:24:37,859
gonna see somebody like I bet if I went

2203
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:40,500
into a gun store they would deny me a

2204
01:24:37,859 --> 01:24:41,460
sale even if I never figured out this

2205
01:24:40,500 --> 01:24:42,420
question or filled out this

2206
01:24:41,460 --> 01:24:44,908
questionnaire they'd say you're a

2207
01:24:42,420 --> 01:24:49,050
pothead you cannot buy a gun and that is

2208
01:24:44,908 --> 01:24:51,268
now up to vaguely up to the store owner

2209
01:24:49,050 --> 01:24:53,099
or the salesperson which is kind of

2210
01:24:51,269 --> 01:24:56,010
ridiculous I'll keep reading the article

2211
01:24:53,099 --> 01:24:58,650
here protecting America from criminals

2212
01:24:56,010 --> 01:24:59,789
wait said both the 2009 memo and last

2213
01:24:58,649 --> 01:25:01,170
week's letter were approved by the

2214
01:24:59,788 --> 01:25:02,639
Justice Department and he does not

2215
01:25:01,170 --> 01:25:06,899
believe there is a contradiction in the

2216
01:25:02,639 --> 01:25:08,609
two messages he also he also that the

2217
01:25:06,899 --> 01:25:10,439
dealers are in good position to help

2218
01:25:08,609 --> 01:25:11,038
prevent firearms from getting into the

2219
01:25:10,439 --> 01:25:12,868
wrong hands

2220
01:25:11,038 --> 01:25:14,639
they must have omitted a word I'm gonna

2221
01:25:12,868 --> 01:25:16,319
say he also said that the dealers are in

2222
01:25:14,639 --> 01:25:17,699
a good position to help prevent firearms

2223
01:25:16,319 --> 01:25:20,538
from getting into the wrong hands that

2224
01:25:17,698 --> 01:25:22,888
makes more sense the FFL aren't cops

2225
01:25:20,538 --> 01:25:24,538
they are at the frontline of protecting

2226
01:25:22,889 --> 01:25:26,159
America from criminals are people who

2227
01:25:24,538 --> 01:25:28,768
are prohibited prohibited from

2228
01:25:26,158 --> 01:25:30,779
possessing firearms Wade said a salesman

2229
01:25:28,769 --> 01:25:33,000
it once license for firearms dealer in

2230
01:25:30,779 --> 01:25:35,009
Montana outdoor sports in Hellena said

2231
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:36,779
he doesn't expect much to change as a

2232
01:25:35,010 --> 01:25:38,579
result of the letter because it's

2233
01:25:36,779 --> 01:25:40,349
largely up to the buyer to reveal

2234
01:25:38,578 --> 01:25:43,018
whether he or she is a medical marijuana

2235
01:25:40,349 --> 01:25:45,269
user who's going to say yes to that ask

2236
01:25:43,019 --> 01:25:47,849
Damon Peters a sales associate for the

2237
01:25:45,269 --> 01:25:49,769
store and a licensed hunting guide a lot

2238
01:25:47,849 --> 01:25:51,269
of views a lot of users of Medical

2239
01:25:49,769 --> 01:25:53,400
Marijuana aren't really shooting sports

2240
01:25:51,269 --> 01:25:54,960
enthusiasts anyway I think we may see a

2241
01:25:53,399 --> 01:25:57,509
seal or two lost but I don't see

2242
01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:59,609
anything dramatic that's going to affect

2243
01:25:57,510 --> 01:26:02,280
us he said

2244
01:25:59,609 --> 01:26:04,349
so there's a lot of talk about guns

2245
01:26:02,279 --> 01:26:08,699
going on in our country later lately and

2246
01:26:04,350 --> 01:26:09,960
I I support guns I mean if they took

2247
01:26:08,699 --> 01:26:11,789
away all the guns the only people that

2248
01:26:09,960 --> 01:26:13,350
would have guns would be the bad guys

2249
01:26:11,789 --> 01:26:14,880
right that's kind of way that works

2250
01:26:13,350 --> 01:26:16,260
right if the guns were illegal you don't

2251
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:17,340
like the criminals aren't gonna care

2252
01:26:16,260 --> 01:26:19,260
that the guns are illegal they're not

2253
01:26:17,340 --> 01:26:21,060
gonna be like oh here's my guns that's

2254
01:26:19,260 --> 01:26:24,119
just gonna that's [ __ ] of a theory I

2255
01:26:21,060 --> 01:26:26,670
think so now what's happening is if you

2256
01:26:24,119 --> 01:26:30,180
are a medical marijuana patient you are

2257
01:26:26,670 --> 01:26:32,329
not allowed to purchase a firearm what

2258
01:26:30,180 --> 01:26:35,430
kind of [ __ ] is that just because so

2259
01:26:32,329 --> 01:26:38,399
here's another side of this III can be a

2260
01:26:35,430 --> 01:26:41,780
vicodin patient I can be a valium

2261
01:26:38,399 --> 01:26:45,149
patient I can be maybe some sort of

2262
01:26:41,779 --> 01:26:47,269
antidepressant user patient or whatever

2263
01:26:45,149 --> 01:26:49,979
you call the person that's taking that

2264
01:26:47,270 --> 01:26:52,290
and then I'm able to buy a gun I can

2265
01:26:49,979 --> 01:26:55,049
take my vicodin my ritalin my value my

2266
01:26:52,289 --> 01:26:57,060
ambien and what else could I take

2267
01:26:55,050 --> 01:26:59,010
possibly to go with this my celebrex and

2268
01:26:57,060 --> 01:27:00,300
my vicodin and then a boner pill because

2269
01:26:59,010 --> 01:27:02,670
everybody who's gotta have a boner pill

2270
01:27:00,300 --> 01:27:04,650
right I could take all of those and then

2271
01:27:02,670 --> 01:27:06,600
I could go buy a gun but I can't use my

2272
01:27:04,649 --> 01:27:09,750
medical cannabis to ease my pain a

2273
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:12,750
little bit or help my appetite and then

2274
01:27:09,750 --> 01:27:15,270
purchase a firearm to either protect my

2275
01:27:12,750 --> 01:27:16,979
home or hunt for food or just have it

2276
01:27:15,270 --> 01:27:19,290
because I'm a good ol American and I

2277
01:27:16,979 --> 01:27:20,879
should have a damn gun this is kind of a

2278
01:27:19,289 --> 01:27:23,369
ridiculous law I thought that everybody

2279
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:24,600
should be made aware of this I don't

2280
01:27:23,369 --> 01:27:29,099
know what we can do about it but I

2281
01:27:24,600 --> 01:27:30,150
thought it was very interesting how they

2282
01:27:29,100 --> 01:27:31,740
are kind of right though about the

2283
01:27:30,149 --> 01:27:33,449
people that smoke medical cannabis not

2284
01:27:31,739 --> 01:27:35,130
wanting to be hunters and shooters but

2285
01:27:33,449 --> 01:27:37,529
this is Colorado and you'd be surprised

2286
01:27:35,130 --> 01:27:39,510
the diversity of people here I've got

2287
01:27:37,529 --> 01:27:41,159
friends who have dreadlocks whose

2288
01:27:39,510 --> 01:27:42,930
snowboard on the one weekend and who

2289
01:27:41,159 --> 01:27:45,420
will go elk hunting the next weekend

2290
01:27:42,930 --> 01:27:47,340
they may be wrong with their assumptions

2291
01:27:45,420 --> 01:27:49,800
on who is hunting and who is using

2292
01:27:47,340 --> 01:27:51,090
cannabis that may be [ __ ] there's so

2293
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:53,520
much in this article that we could [ __ ]

2294
01:27:51,090 --> 01:27:56,970
about but instead let's move on to a

2295
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:59,100
little bit more of a positive note this

2296
01:27:56,970 --> 01:28:01,590
article comes from the Washington Post

2297
01:27:59,100 --> 01:28:03,750
and it is written by a guy named Radley

2298
01:28:01,590 --> 01:28:05,550
Balko and the headline is since

2299
01:28:03,750 --> 01:28:07,619
marijuana legalization highway

2300
01:28:05,550 --> 01:28:10,980
fatalities in Colorado are at a near

2301
01:28:07,619 --> 01:28:12,159
historic low yes let me read this

2302
01:28:10,979 --> 01:28:14,839
article for you it's

2303
01:28:12,159 --> 01:28:17,329
since Colorado voters legalized pot in

2304
01:28:14,840 --> 01:28:19,039
2012 prohibition supporters have warned

2305
01:28:17,329 --> 01:28:21,470
that recreational marijuana will lead to

2306
01:28:19,039 --> 01:28:23,989
a scout of drugged drivers on the

2307
01:28:21,470 --> 01:28:25,130
state's roads they often point out that

2308
01:28:23,989 --> 01:28:27,500
when the state legalized medical

2309
01:28:25,130 --> 01:28:30,170
marijuana in 2001 there is a surge in

2310
01:28:27,500 --> 01:28:31,670
drivers found to have smoked pot they

2311
01:28:30,170 --> 01:28:33,859
also point to studies showing that in

2312
01:28:31,670 --> 01:28:35,420
other states showing that in other

2313
01:28:33,859 --> 01:28:37,699
states that have legalized pot for

2314
01:28:35,420 --> 01:28:38,989
medicinal purposes we've seen it seen an

2315
01:28:37,699 --> 01:28:40,699
increase in the number of drivers

2316
01:28:38,989 --> 01:28:43,489
testing positive for the drug who were

2317
01:28:40,699 --> 01:28:45,500
involved in fatal car accidents the anti

2318
01:28:43,489 --> 01:28:47,210
pot group Sam recently pointed out that

2319
01:28:45,500 --> 01:28:49,310
even before the first legal pots were

2320
01:28:47,210 --> 01:28:50,810
open in Washington State the number of

2321
01:28:49,310 --> 01:28:54,140
drivers in that state testing positive

2322
01:28:50,810 --> 01:28:56,000
for pot jumped by 1/3 the problem with

2323
01:28:54,140 --> 01:28:57,770
these criticisms is that we can test

2324
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:59,569
only for the president presence of

2325
01:28:57,770 --> 01:29:01,790
marijuana metabolites not for

2326
01:28:59,569 --> 01:29:03,380
inebriation metabolites can linger in

2327
01:29:01,789 --> 01:29:05,720
the body for days after the drugs

2328
01:29:03,380 --> 01:29:06,430
effects wear off sometimes even for

2329
01:29:05,720 --> 01:29:08,690
weeks

2330
01:29:06,430 --> 01:29:10,310
I'm a very heavy I'm gonna chime in

2331
01:29:08,689 --> 01:29:13,479
myself here I'm a very heavy cannabis

2332
01:29:10,310 --> 01:29:16,370
user and a long time ago this had to be

2333
01:29:13,479 --> 01:29:18,019
nearly 10 years ago I was trying to get

2334
01:29:16,369 --> 01:29:20,119
a good job that would have paid very

2335
01:29:18,020 --> 01:29:23,330
well and had some great benefits and so

2336
01:29:20,119 --> 01:29:25,159
I quit smoking cannabis and I was all I

2337
01:29:23,329 --> 01:29:27,409
had to do is pass one drug test all this

2338
01:29:25,159 --> 01:29:28,609
place did was one pre-hire screening and

2339
01:29:27,409 --> 01:29:29,899
then I would have been home free I could

2340
01:29:28,609 --> 01:29:31,239
have worked there forever and never had

2341
01:29:29,899 --> 01:29:33,289
to pee test again unless I hurt myself

2342
01:29:31,239 --> 01:29:38,659
at which case I would have just walked

2343
01:29:33,289 --> 01:29:40,369
away so I went 30 days and I took a

2344
01:29:38,659 --> 01:29:42,380
voluntary pee test that you can buy at

2345
01:29:40,369 --> 01:29:44,930
this door and I was still dirty

2346
01:29:42,380 --> 01:29:45,680
I went 45 days took a pee test and I was

2347
01:29:44,930 --> 01:29:48,320
still dirty

2348
01:29:45,680 --> 01:29:49,940
I went 60 days and I took a pee test and

2349
01:29:48,319 --> 01:29:52,429
I was still dirty but I already had my

2350
01:29:49,939 --> 01:29:53,449
interview scheduled so 63 days in I went

2351
01:29:52,430 --> 01:29:55,820
and took a pee test

2352
01:29:53,449 --> 01:29:58,849
and the doctor called me back and told

2353
01:29:55,819 --> 01:30:02,000
me that I still had more than 1,400

2354
01:29:58,850 --> 01:30:05,120
nanograms per whatever their measurement

2355
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:07,699
was I had more than their limit of THC

2356
01:30:05,119 --> 01:30:09,619
in my urine after 63 days and he asked

2357
01:30:07,699 --> 01:30:11,389
me if I was taking prescription Marinol

2358
01:30:09,619 --> 01:30:13,640
or what I was doing I told him that I

2359
01:30:11,390 --> 01:30:15,530
hadn't smoked in nine weeks and he was a

2360
01:30:13,640 --> 01:30:17,119
little bit blown away so they're saying

2361
01:30:15,529 --> 01:30:19,429
that metabolites can linger in the body

2362
01:30:17,119 --> 01:30:22,640
for days sometimes even weeks

2363
01:30:19,430 --> 01:30:24,650
I am a prime example I went nine weeks

2364
01:30:22,640 --> 01:30:25,670
and there was still cannabis in my

2365
01:30:24,649 --> 01:30:27,768
system

2366
01:30:25,670 --> 01:30:29,480
let me tell you that on day 64 I took a

2367
01:30:27,769 --> 01:30:31,429
phat bong hit and I don't think I've

2368
01:30:29,479 --> 01:30:33,229
ever been that [ __ ] high in my life

2369
01:30:31,429 --> 01:30:35,179
all right I'm gonna continue on what's

2370
01:30:33,229 --> 01:30:36,888
the article here it says because we all

2371
01:30:35,179 --> 01:30:37,969
metabolize drugs differently and at

2372
01:30:36,889 --> 01:30:40,010
different times in under different

2373
01:30:37,969 --> 01:30:41,840
conditions all that positive test tells

2374
01:30:40,010 --> 01:30:43,460
us is that the driver has smoked pot at

2375
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:45,319
some point in the past few days or weeks

2376
01:30:43,460 --> 01:30:46,698
it makes sense that loosening

2377
01:30:45,319 --> 01:30:48,738
restrictions on pot would result in

2378
01:30:46,698 --> 01:30:50,419
higher any higher percentage of drivers

2379
01:30:48,738 --> 01:30:52,069
involved in fatal traffic accidents

2380
01:30:50,420 --> 01:30:54,859
having smoked the drug at some point

2381
01:30:52,069 --> 01:30:56,118
over the past few days or weeks he'd

2382
01:30:54,859 --> 01:30:58,038
also expect to find that a higher

2383
01:30:56,118 --> 01:30:59,808
percentage of churchgoers good

2384
01:30:58,038 --> 01:31:01,130
Samaritans and soup kitchen volunteers

2385
01:30:59,809 --> 01:31:03,380
would have pot in their system

2386
01:31:01,130 --> 01:31:05,840
it'd expect a similar result among any

2387
01:31:03,380 --> 01:31:07,519
large sampling of people this doesn't

2388
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:09,498
necessarily mean that marijuana caused

2389
01:31:07,519 --> 01:31:11,480
or was even a contributing factor to

2390
01:31:09,498 --> 01:31:13,969
accidents traffic violations or

2391
01:31:11,479 --> 01:31:16,038
fatalities this isn't an argument that

2392
01:31:13,969 --> 01:31:17,719
pot wasn't a factor in at least some of

2393
01:31:16,038 --> 01:31:20,268
those accidents either but that's

2394
01:31:17,719 --> 01:31:22,099
precisely the point a post accident test

2395
01:31:20,269 --> 01:31:24,590
for marijuana metabolites doesn't tell

2396
01:31:22,099 --> 01:31:26,809
us much about whether pot contributed to

2397
01:31:24,590 --> 01:31:29,059
the accident since the new Colorado law

2398
01:31:26,809 --> 01:31:31,730
took effect in January the drug driver

2399
01:31:29,059 --> 01:31:33,380
panic has only intensified I've already

2400
01:31:31,729 --> 01:31:34,879
written about one dubious example and

2401
01:31:33,380 --> 01:31:37,519
watch the Colorado Highway Patrol and

2402
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:38,498
some local and had some local and

2403
01:31:37,519 --> 01:31:40,579
national media

2404
01:31:38,498 --> 01:31:41,960
perpetuated a story that a driver was

2405
01:31:40,578 --> 01:31:43,488
high on pot when he slammed into a

2406
01:31:41,960 --> 01:31:45,769
couple of police cars parked on an

2407
01:31:43,488 --> 01:31:47,388
interstate exit ramp well the driver did

2408
01:31:45,769 --> 01:31:49,849
have some pot in his system his

2409
01:31:47,389 --> 01:31:51,618
blood-alcohol level was off the charts

2410
01:31:49,849 --> 01:31:53,239
and was far more likely the cause of the

2411
01:31:51,618 --> 01:31:55,189
accident and that's something that we've

2412
01:31:53,238 --> 01:31:56,928
seen a few times here the people will be

2413
01:31:55,189 --> 01:31:58,009
on other drugs they'll be drunk and

2414
01:31:56,929 --> 01:31:59,449
they'll get an accident they'll have a

2415
01:31:58,010 --> 01:32:01,219
little bit of cannabis in their system

2416
01:31:59,448 --> 01:32:03,529
and they blame that [ __ ] on the cannabis

2417
01:32:01,219 --> 01:32:05,719
like the overlook the fact that this guy

2418
01:32:03,529 --> 01:32:07,488
was on four hits acid that he was

2419
01:32:05,719 --> 01:32:09,498
tweaking his brains out that he had

2420
01:32:07,488 --> 01:32:10,998
mushrooms in his brain but he smoked a

2421
01:32:09,498 --> 01:32:12,319
little bit of weed so that had to have

2422
01:32:10,998 --> 01:32:13,219
been what sent him over the edge made

2423
01:32:12,319 --> 01:32:15,018
him crash his car

2424
01:32:13,219 --> 01:32:22,578
all right we're gonna go a little bit

2425
01:32:15,019 --> 01:32:24,289
more here in my colleague Mark Fisher's

2426
01:32:22,578 --> 01:32:26,118
recent dispatch from Colorado law

2427
01:32:24,288 --> 01:32:27,259
enforcement officials there and in

2428
01:32:26,118 --> 01:32:28,698
bordering states warned that they're

2429
01:32:27,260 --> 01:32:30,920
seeing more drug drivers

2430
01:32:28,698 --> 01:32:32,960
Congress recently held hearings on the

2431
01:32:30,920 --> 01:32:34,609
matter complete with dire predictions

2432
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:36,050
such as we're going to have a lot more

2433
01:32:34,609 --> 01:32:38,719
people stoned on the highway

2434
01:32:36,050 --> 01:32:42,289
there will be consequences from Rep John

2435
01:32:38,719 --> 01:32:44,000
mica of Florida some have called for a

2436
01:32:42,289 --> 01:32:45,920
zero-tolerance policy if you're driving

2437
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:48,319
with any trace of Potter system you're

2438
01:32:45,920 --> 01:32:50,270
guilty of a DWI that would effectively

2439
01:32:48,319 --> 01:32:52,009
ban anyone who smokes pot from driving

2440
01:32:50,270 --> 01:32:54,139
up to a couple of weeks after the last

2441
01:32:52,010 --> 01:32:57,559
joint including people who legitimately

2442
01:32:54,139 --> 01:32:58,880
use the drug for medical reasons that

2443
01:32:57,559 --> 01:33:01,550
means that I would never be able to

2444
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:03,980
drive again is basically what that [ __ ]

2445
01:33:01,550 --> 01:33:06,199
says this is that any medical cannabis

2446
01:33:03,979 --> 01:33:08,959
user in Colorado would not be able to

2447
01:33:06,198 --> 01:33:11,269
drive and I guess now you can't drive or

2448
01:33:08,960 --> 01:33:12,289
have a gun is the two articles that I've

2449
01:33:11,270 --> 01:33:14,929
read today this is getting a little

2450
01:33:12,289 --> 01:33:16,189
crazy police state much with a question

2451
01:33:14,929 --> 01:33:18,050
mark all right I'm gonna read more of

2452
01:33:16,189 --> 01:33:19,549
the article here we go it seems to me

2453
01:33:18,050 --> 01:33:21,980
that the best way to gauge the effect

2454
01:33:19,550 --> 01:33:23,389
gauged the effect legalization has had

2455
01:33:21,979 --> 01:33:25,399
on the roadways is to look at what

2456
01:33:23,389 --> 01:33:26,868
happened on the road since legalization

2457
01:33:25,399 --> 01:33:28,939
took effect here's a month-by-month

2458
01:33:26,868 --> 01:33:30,738
comparison of highway fatalities in

2459
01:33:28,939 --> 01:33:32,960
Colorado through the first seven months

2460
01:33:30,738 --> 01:33:34,729
of this year and last year for more

2461
01:33:32,960 --> 01:33:37,069
thorough comparison I've also included

2462
01:33:34,729 --> 01:33:39,919
the highest fatality figures for each

2463
01:33:37,069 --> 01:33:42,529
month since 2002 the lowest for each

2464
01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:44,719
month since 2002 and the average for

2465
01:33:42,529 --> 01:33:46,250
each month since 2002 and there is a

2466
01:33:44,719 --> 01:33:48,500
graph here you guys I know graphs don't

2467
01:33:46,250 --> 01:33:51,069
do you any good on the podcast but we're

2468
01:33:48,500 --> 01:33:54,319
gonna look at this the high since 2002

2469
01:33:51,069 --> 01:33:56,960
they're showing all right so there are

2470
01:33:54,319 --> 01:33:59,599
one two three four five lines on this

2471
01:33:56,960 --> 01:34:02,689
graph right and basically it is showing

2472
01:33:59,599 --> 01:34:04,670
you that [ __ ] has gone down just take my

2473
01:34:02,689 --> 01:34:06,529
word for it so it says as you can see

2474
01:34:04,670 --> 01:34:08,929
roadway fatalities this year are down

2475
01:34:06,529 --> 01:34:11,029
from last year and down from the 13-year

2476
01:34:08,929 --> 01:34:13,010
average of the seven months so far this

2477
01:34:11,029 --> 01:34:15,679
year five months saw a lower fatality

2478
01:34:13,010 --> 01:34:17,480
figure than the last two months I

2479
01:34:15,679 --> 01:34:19,908
slightly higher figure this year and in

2480
01:34:17,479 --> 01:34:22,250
one month the two figures were equal if

2481
01:34:19,908 --> 01:34:24,679
we add up the total fatalities from

2482
01:34:22,250 --> 01:34:29,149
January through July it looks like this

2483
01:34:24,679 --> 01:34:30,618
and we're gonna see it's a down sloping

2484
01:34:29,149 --> 01:34:32,569
graph you guys just take my word for

2485
01:34:30,618 --> 01:34:34,189
that it is a down sloping at starts high

2486
01:34:32,569 --> 01:34:35,960
and it goes low and then I'll read the

2487
01:34:34,189 --> 01:34:38,779
rest of the article it says here the

2488
01:34:35,960 --> 01:34:39,980
high bar and he says pardon the pun the

2489
01:34:38,779 --> 01:34:43,039
high bar is what you get when you add

2490
01:34:39,979 --> 01:34:45,468
the worst January since 2002 - the worst

2491
01:34:43,039 --> 01:34:47,658
February - the worst March and so on the

2492
01:34:45,469 --> 01:34:49,109
low bar is the sum total of the safest

2493
01:34:47,658 --> 01:34:52,229
January February

2494
01:34:49,109 --> 01:34:55,769
etc since 2002 what's notable here is

2495
01:34:52,229 --> 01:34:58,229
that the total so far in 2014 are closer

2496
01:34:55,770 --> 01:35:01,590
to the safest composite year since 2002

2497
01:34:58,229 --> 01:35:03,359
then to the average year since 2002 I

2498
01:35:01,590 --> 01:35:05,909
should also add here that these are

2499
01:35:03,359 --> 01:35:08,069
total fatalities if I were to calculate

2500
01:35:05,908 --> 01:35:10,738
these figures as a rate say miles driven

2501
01:35:08,069 --> 01:35:13,019
per fatality the drop would be starker

2502
01:35:10,738 --> 01:35:15,359
both for this year and since Colorado

2503
01:35:13,020 --> 01:35:17,610
legalized medical marijuana in 2001

2504
01:35:15,359 --> 01:35:18,960
while the number of miles Americans

2505
01:35:17,609 --> 01:35:20,819
drive annually has leveled off

2506
01:35:18,960 --> 01:35:23,429
nationally since the mid-2000s the

2507
01:35:20,819 --> 01:35:25,500
number of total miles traveled continues

2508
01:35:23,429 --> 01:35:27,719
to go up in Colorado if I were to

2509
01:35:25,500 --> 01:35:30,960
measure by rate then the state would be

2510
01:35:27,719 --> 01:35:32,670
at lows unseen in decades so we're

2511
01:35:30,960 --> 01:35:35,850
driving even more is what he's saying

2512
01:35:32,670 --> 01:35:37,260
and we are crashing even less the

2513
01:35:35,850 --> 01:35:39,000
figures are similar in states that have

2514
01:35:37,260 --> 01:35:40,949
legalized medical marijuana while some

2515
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:42,689
studies have shown that the number of

2516
01:35:40,948 --> 01:35:44,638
drivers involved in fatal collisions who

2517
01:35:42,689 --> 01:35:46,948
test positive for marijuana had steadily

2518
01:35:44,639 --> 01:35:48,690
steadily increased as pot has become

2519
01:35:46,948 --> 01:35:50,579
more available other studies have shown

2520
01:35:48,689 --> 01:35:52,649
that overall traffic fatalities in those

2521
01:35:50,579 --> 01:35:54,630
states have dropped again because the

2522
01:35:52,649 --> 01:35:57,029
pot tests only measure for recent pot

2523
01:35:54,630 --> 01:36:00,480
use not inebriation there's nothing

2524
01:35:57,029 --> 01:36:02,158
inconsistent about those results of

2525
01:36:00,479 --> 01:36:04,138
course the continuing drop in roadway

2526
01:36:02,158 --> 01:36:06,089
fatalities in Colorado and elsewhere is

2527
01:36:04,139 --> 01:36:07,980
due to a variety of factors such as

2528
01:36:06,090 --> 01:36:09,420
better built cars and trucks improved

2529
01:36:07,979 --> 01:36:11,729
safety features and better Road

2530
01:36:09,420 --> 01:36:13,350
Engineering these features in and of

2531
01:36:11,729 --> 01:36:15,029
themselves only indicate that the roads

2532
01:36:13,350 --> 01:36:17,039
are getting safer they don't suggest

2533
01:36:15,029 --> 01:36:19,319
that pot had anything to do with it

2534
01:36:17,039 --> 01:36:21,539
we're only 7 months in maybe these

2535
01:36:19,319 --> 01:36:23,368
figures will change finally it's also

2536
01:36:21,539 --> 01:36:26,550
possible that if it weren't for legal

2537
01:36:23,368 --> 01:36:29,130
pot the 2014 figures would be even lower

2538
01:36:26,550 --> 01:36:31,020
there's no real way to know that we can

2539
01:36:29,130 --> 01:36:33,118
only look at the data available but you

2540
01:36:31,020 --> 01:36:34,679
can bet that if fatalities were up this

2541
01:36:33,118 --> 01:36:35,929
year prohibition supporters would be

2542
01:36:34,679 --> 01:36:39,029
blaming it on legal marijuana

2543
01:36:35,929 --> 01:36:41,130
interestingly the road fatalities have

2544
01:36:39,029 --> 01:36:43,618
generally been falling in Colorado for a

2545
01:36:41,130 --> 01:36:45,359
long time 2013 actually saw a slight

2546
01:36:43,618 --> 01:36:47,908
decrease from 2012

2547
01:36:45,359 --> 01:36:50,219
so fatalities are down the year after

2548
01:36:47,908 --> 01:36:52,948
legalization after having gone up the

2549
01:36:50,219 --> 01:36:54,840
year before so that being said some

2550
01:36:52,948 --> 01:36:56,698
Reacher's have gone some researchers

2551
01:36:54,840 --> 01:36:58,529
have gone so far as to suggest that

2552
01:36:56,698 --> 01:37:01,169
better access to pot is making the roads

2553
01:36:58,529 --> 01:37:02,550
safer at least marginally the theory is

2554
01:37:01,170 --> 01:37:05,399
that people are subsea

2555
01:37:02,550 --> 01:37:08,010
our substituting pot for alcohol and pot

2556
01:37:05,399 --> 01:37:10,710
causes less driver impairment than booze

2557
01:37:08,010 --> 01:37:12,960
I need to see more studies before I'd be

2558
01:37:10,710 --> 01:37:14,760
ready to endorse that theory for example

2559
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:16,319
there's also some research contradicting

2560
01:37:14,760 --> 01:37:19,230
the theory that drinkers are ready to

2561
01:37:16,319 --> 01:37:24,059
substitute pot for alcohol you know that

2562
01:37:19,229 --> 01:37:26,009
uh I quit drinking completely when I got

2563
01:37:24,060 --> 01:37:27,539
my medical marijuana card I said to

2564
01:37:26,010 --> 01:37:29,280
myself I'm able to go to the store and

2565
01:37:27,539 --> 01:37:31,529
buy cannabis now I could buy all the

2566
01:37:29,279 --> 01:37:33,029
herb I want like because before you'd

2567
01:37:31,529 --> 01:37:34,529
have to wait for your dude to have some

2568
01:37:33,029 --> 01:37:35,880
or you'd have to grow your own or you'd

2569
01:37:34,529 --> 01:37:38,639
have to wait for your crop to be ready

2570
01:37:35,880 --> 01:37:41,130
or eat hope on here Bros had a joint but

2571
01:37:38,640 --> 01:37:42,480
when I got my medical marijuana card and

2572
01:37:41,130 --> 01:37:43,529
I could just smoke down and then go to

2573
01:37:42,479 --> 01:37:45,239
the store and buy some more

2574
01:37:43,529 --> 01:37:47,460
and then smoke down and when I ran out

2575
01:37:45,239 --> 01:37:50,460
just go to the store tomorrow I didn't

2576
01:37:47,460 --> 01:37:52,109
even need to drink anymore I quit

2577
01:37:50,460 --> 01:37:53,640
drinking I haven't had alcohol in so

2578
01:37:52,109 --> 01:37:55,979
many years and now I smoke all the

2579
01:37:53,640 --> 01:37:58,140
cannabis I want there's no need to drink

2580
01:37:55,979 --> 01:38:00,029
when I can smoke herb all right I'll

2581
01:37:58,140 --> 01:38:02,220
continue with the article it says but

2582
01:38:00,029 --> 01:38:04,019
the data are far more supportive of that

2583
01:38:02,220 --> 01:38:06,090
than the claims that stoned drivers are

2584
01:38:04,020 --> 01:38:07,770
menacing Colorado's roadways and then he

2585
01:38:06,090 --> 01:38:09,390
says clarification I wrote that we can

2586
01:38:07,770 --> 01:38:11,010
test only for the presence of marijuana

2587
01:38:09,390 --> 01:38:13,170
metabolites not for inebriation that

2588
01:38:11,010 --> 01:38:15,030
isn't quite accurate he does go on to

2589
01:38:13,170 --> 01:38:16,649
say this is true of roadside tests but a

2590
01:38:15,029 --> 01:38:17,779
blood test taken at a hospital can

2591
01:38:16,649 --> 01:38:20,609
measure for THC the psychoactive

2592
01:38:17,779 --> 01:38:21,840
ingredient in marijuana oh he said

2593
01:38:20,609 --> 01:38:23,399
ingredient we got to change that to

2594
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:24,449
compound I'm crossing it out on the

2595
01:38:23,399 --> 01:38:26,729
keyboard screen or on the computer

2596
01:38:24,449 --> 01:38:28,859
screen or writing compound that being

2597
01:38:26,729 --> 01:38:31,409
said even here there are problems

2598
01:38:28,859 --> 01:38:32,969
regular users can still have remnant THC

2599
01:38:31,409 --> 01:38:35,130
in their blood well after the effects of

2600
01:38:32,970 --> 01:38:37,409
worn off regular users can also have

2601
01:38:35,130 --> 01:38:39,630
levels above the legal limit and still

2602
01:38:37,409 --> 01:38:42,210
drive perfectly well he's talking about

2603
01:38:39,630 --> 01:38:44,100
me in Colorado a THC level of five

2604
01:38:42,210 --> 01:38:45,989
nanograms or more brings a perceptive

2605
01:38:44,100 --> 01:38:48,030
charge of driving under the influence

2606
01:38:45,989 --> 01:38:49,920
however represent references to

2607
01:38:48,029 --> 01:38:51,689
marijuana related accidents and studies

2608
01:38:49,920 --> 01:38:53,819
by prohibitionists and law enforcement

2609
01:38:51,689 --> 01:38:55,229
could refer to any measure or trace of

2610
01:38:53,819 --> 01:38:56,759
the drug so when officials and

2611
01:38:55,229 --> 01:38:59,069
legalization opponents talk about

2612
01:38:56,760 --> 01:39:01,320
increases in these figures it still

2613
01:38:59,069 --> 01:39:04,049
isn't clear what any of this means for

2614
01:39:01,319 --> 01:39:05,849
road safety does I need to take a quick

2615
01:39:04,050 --> 01:39:08,750
drink excuse me for one minute and then

2616
01:39:05,850 --> 01:39:08,750
we will talk about this

2617
01:39:12,590 --> 01:39:17,670
all right my throat is back in action I

2618
01:39:14,908 --> 01:39:20,158
was getting dry there so since we have

2619
01:39:17,670 --> 01:39:23,670
legalized cannabis the traffic has been

2620
01:39:20,158 --> 01:39:25,348
safer when you get drunk you drive

2621
01:39:23,670 --> 01:39:26,908
recklessly you don't give a [ __ ] you

2622
01:39:25,349 --> 01:39:28,529
want to go really really fast you're not

2623
01:39:26,908 --> 01:39:30,089
paying attention you're blacked out and

2624
01:39:28,529 --> 01:39:31,469
you're just [ __ ] driving and getting

2625
01:39:30,090 --> 01:39:32,670
there you don't care what Lane you're in

2626
01:39:31,469 --> 01:39:34,828
you don't care what direction you're

2627
01:39:32,670 --> 01:39:36,840
going probably don't even know where the

2628
01:39:34,828 --> 01:39:37,759
hell you're trying to go but when you're

2629
01:39:36,840 --> 01:39:41,578
high

2630
01:39:37,760 --> 01:39:42,780
you're just calm you look twice and you

2631
01:39:41,578 --> 01:39:45,479
go a little bit under the speed limit

2632
01:39:42,779 --> 01:39:48,090
because I want to go too fast I'm high

2633
01:39:45,479 --> 01:39:49,559
man you just want to cruise you know put

2634
01:39:48,090 --> 01:39:51,060
some music at a comfortable level and

2635
01:39:49,560 --> 01:39:53,280
you want to watch everything come at you

2636
01:39:51,060 --> 01:39:56,010
at a decent pace like I never get too

2637
01:39:53,279 --> 01:39:57,359
crazy when I'm driving hi I will admit

2638
01:39:56,010 --> 01:40:00,329
that when I was a youngster I would

2639
01:39:57,359 --> 01:40:02,578
drive a little bit drunk and uh that was

2640
01:40:00,328 --> 01:40:04,289
some scary [ __ ] I have never been scared

2641
01:40:02,578 --> 01:40:07,039
of myself driving high but I have scared

2642
01:40:04,289 --> 01:40:09,210
the [ __ ] out of myself driving too drunk

2643
01:40:07,039 --> 01:40:10,889
because I don't drink alcohol so I can

2644
01:40:09,210 --> 01:40:12,500

give a huge huge shout out to kind pain

2786
01:48:48,139 --> 01:48:52,998
management in Denver Colorado they do

2787
01:48:51,109 --> 01:48:54,558
not sponsor the show they are not

2788
01:48:52,998 --> 01:48:56,929
supporters of the show but what they are

2789
01:48:54,559 --> 01:48:58,969
doing is they are growing lemon Jeffrey

2790
01:48:56,929 --> 01:49:00,380
which is the strain I bred I put that

2791
01:48:58,969 --> 01:49:02,989
together and I got some seeds in their

2792
01:49:00,380 --> 01:49:04,400
hands and they are killing it they have

2793
01:49:02,988 --> 01:49:06,738
posted some lab tests upon their

2794
01:49:04,399 --> 01:49:09,348
Instagram feed they're hitting over 26%

2795
01:49:06,738 --> 01:49:12,259
THC on the lemon Jeffrey and the best

2796
01:49:09,349 --> 01:49:14,179
part is it is on shelves now you can

2797

2801
01:49:20,149 --> 01:49:24,319
kind pain-management did with it big

2802
01:49:22,010 --> 01:49:26,030
huge shout out to them one thing I want

2803
01:49:24,319 --> 01:49:29,448
to do on this podcast is check out a

2804
01:49:26,029 --> 01:49:32,210
video that somebody sent to me of three

2805
01:49:29,448 --> 01:49:33,768
ex-cops smoking weed and the video is

2806
01:49:32,210 --> 01:49:35,480
six minutes long I'm gonna watch the

2807
01:49:33,769 --> 01:49:37,010
whole thing I may edit parts of this out

2808
01:49:35,479 --> 01:49:38,748
of the podcast so that you guys don't

2809
01:49:37,010 --> 01:49:40,639
have to sit through six whole minutes I

2810
01:49:38,748 --> 01:49:43,130
may skip through parts of it we'll see

2811
01:49:40,639 --> 01:49:44,659
how my ATD kicks in as we do this but I

2812
01:49:43,130 --> 01:49:46,400
think this is a great video we're gonna

2813
01:49:44,658 --> 01:49:48,738
watch parts of it and then we will talk

2814
01:49:46,399 --> 01:49:50,899
about it so let me kill the theme song

2815
01:49:48,738 --> 01:49:54,638
and we are going to play this cops

2816
01:49:50,899 --> 01:49:56,420
smoking weed video so it starts off

2817
01:49:54,639 --> 01:50:01,880
music I don't know what that's called

2818
01:49:56,420 --> 01:50:04,730
but some really older dudes old enough

2819
01:50:01,880 --> 01:50:11,868
to be our fathers taking ball grips and

2820
01:50:04,729 --> 01:50:14,268
then here's what they have to say first

2821
01:50:11,868 --> 01:50:17,630
time I smoked I was 14 years old I got

2822
01:50:14,269 --> 01:50:19,489
caught the first time I smoked so and

2823
01:50:17,630 --> 01:50:22,550
for some reason there we go wash on that

2824
01:50:19,488 --> 01:50:24,828
for a while tried it once and tell ya I

2825
01:50:22,550 --> 01:50:27,619
was on a waterbed with a very agreeable

2826
01:50:24,828 --> 01:50:30,288
woman and listening to Rhapsody in Blue

2827
01:50:27,618 --> 01:50:35,029
which I know lasts for about 18 minutes

2828
01:50:30,288 --> 01:50:40,158
and 40 seconds and lasted for two or

2829
01:50:35,029 --> 01:50:41,630
three hours all three of these ex cops

2830
01:50:40,158 --> 01:50:43,848
have just admitted to having used

2831
01:50:41,630 --> 01:50:47,118
cannabis illegally in their life and now

2832
01:50:43,849 --> 01:50:49,639
what they're doing is taking a sobriety

2833
01:50:47,118 --> 01:50:50,960
test before they smoked any cannabis so

2834
01:50:49,639 --> 01:50:52,038
there are three retired cops they all

2835
01:50:50,960 --> 01:50:54,260
know how to [ __ ] with each other and

2836
01:50:52,038 --> 01:50:54,829
give each other a sobriety test this one

2837
01:50:54,260 --> 01:50:56,239
old guy is

2838
01:50:54,829 --> 01:50:58,850
got such shitty Olney's that he can

2839
01:50:56,239 --> 01:51:00,439
barely pass the heel-to-toe walk but

2840
01:50:58,850 --> 01:51:01,910
this says also that it was recorded in

2841
01:51:00,439 --> 01:51:03,379
Washington where cannabis is legalized

2842
01:51:01,909 --> 01:51:05,659
so they're keeping these cops out of

2843
01:51:03,380 --> 01:51:06,800
trouble cop number one now they're in

2844
01:51:05,659 --> 01:51:08,930
plainclothes they don't look like cops

2845
01:51:06,800 --> 01:51:10,340
their facial hair looks like cops guys

2846
01:51:08,930 --> 01:51:12,500
plainclothes guy number one is now

2847
01:51:10,340 --> 01:51:14,409
hitting the bong he had the presenter of

2848
01:51:12,500 --> 01:51:18,260
the video light at for him you know

2849
01:51:14,409 --> 01:51:21,460
he'll let you in nineteen seventy and

2850
01:51:18,260 --> 01:51:31,250
went to work right in the same year and

2851
01:51:21,460 --> 01:51:33,470
didn't retire until 97 that was a good

2852
01:51:31,250 --> 01:51:37,300
rip my name is David I was a reserve

2853
01:51:33,470 --> 01:51:39,260
police officer from 1997 through 2004

2854
01:51:37,300 --> 01:51:41,449
second dude took a pretty nice body

2855
01:51:39,260 --> 01:51:45,800
Robert went to police academy in the

2856
01:51:41,449 --> 01:51:50,300
fall of 1970 and worked until the fall

2857
01:51:45,800 --> 01:51:52,670
of 1986 and then after that I taught as

2858
01:51:50,300 --> 01:51:54,670
a freelance trainer mostly for the

2859
01:51:52,670 --> 01:51:58,850
criminal justice training Commission

2860
01:51:54,670 --> 01:52:00,079
police academy for nine years

2861
01:51:58,850 --> 01:52:02,180
all right so none of these guys knew how

2862
01:52:00,079 --> 01:52:04,279
to carve they've all taken a couple of

2863
01:52:02,180 --> 01:52:05,900
fat bong hits and now it's starting to

2864
01:52:04,279 --> 01:52:07,819
kick in the one guy just said to no we

2865
01:52:05,899 --> 01:52:09,409
wait and this is where the fun starts

2866
01:52:07,819 --> 01:52:12,049
the clock shows you five minutes have

2867
01:52:09,409 --> 01:52:13,369
gone by and we'll let you write it first

2868
01:52:12,050 --> 01:52:19,880
because I think I had a stuck on my

2869
01:52:13,369 --> 01:52:21,649
mustache or something you know I thought

2870
01:52:19,880 --> 01:52:23,510
about that a lot and as far as I can

2871
01:52:21,649 --> 01:52:25,489
remember I never arrested anyone for it

2872
01:52:23,510 --> 01:52:27,650
but I took a lot of pot away from people

2873
01:52:25,489 --> 01:52:29,029
and threw it away in front of them and I

2874
01:52:27,649 --> 01:52:30,920
thought that was a bigger deterrent than

2875
01:52:29,029 --> 01:52:33,529
actually writing a criminal citation I

2876
01:52:30,920 --> 01:52:36,380
think it's illegal I think it should be

2877
01:52:33,529 --> 01:52:39,529
more widely available for medical

2878
01:52:36,380 --> 01:52:41,140
reasons it's like the last piece of

2879
01:52:39,529 --> 01:52:44,859
prohibitions

2880
01:52:41,140 --> 01:52:50,289
I think you can be a gateway this is my

2881
01:52:44,859 --> 01:52:52,149
favorite part the the host is a little

2882
01:52:50,289 --> 01:52:54,399
bit hard to hear on this show his audio

2883
01:52:52,149 --> 01:52:56,439
is terrible so what the guy just asked

2884
01:52:54,399 --> 01:52:58,269
these cops is do you think marijuana is

2885
01:52:56,439 --> 01:53:00,250
a gateway drug and I'm gonna back up

2886
01:52:58,270 --> 01:53:02,110
about just a couple of seconds here

2887
01:53:00,250 --> 01:53:06,340
because this is honestly my favorite

2888
01:53:02,109 --> 01:53:30,369
part of the videos this guy's answer is

2889
01:53:06,340 --> 01:53:32,739
a gateway drug so that guy just said

2890
01:53:30,369 --> 01:53:34,449
that milk is the gateway drug you guys

2891
01:53:32,739 --> 01:53:36,789
cuz everybody that started that does

2892
01:53:34,449 --> 01:53:38,260
heroin started off drinking milk I don't

2893
01:53:36,789 --> 01:53:40,600
know if he really feels that way or if

2894
01:53:38,260 --> 01:53:41,949
he's just too high and hasn't been high

2895
01:53:40,600 --> 01:53:43,690
in years and that's what just came out

2896
01:53:41,949 --> 01:53:45,399
of his head but that was my favorite

2897
01:53:43,689 --> 01:53:47,500
statement from this whole video was

2898
01:53:45,399 --> 01:53:49,839
hearing that cop say that everybody that

2899
01:53:47,500 --> 01:53:52,779
is on heroin started off using milk so

2900
01:53:49,840 --> 01:53:54,369
milk is the gateway drug also the one

2901
01:53:52,779 --> 01:53:55,659
cop said he's never arrested people but

2902
01:53:54,369 --> 01:53:58,329
he's taken a lot of weed away from

2903
01:53:55,659 --> 01:54:00,010
people that's respectable his job was to

2904
01:53:58,329 --> 01:54:01,960
arrest people for leading he didn't do

2905
01:54:00,010 --> 01:54:04,329
it so he's kind of on our team a little

2906
01:54:01,960 --> 01:54:05,859
bit the other cop said it should be

2907
01:54:04,329 --> 01:54:07,960
legal and it should be more readily

2908
01:54:05,859 --> 01:54:09,729
available for medical purposes so I

2909
01:54:07,960 --> 01:54:12,430
applaud these cops so far let's keep

2910
01:54:09,729 --> 01:54:14,259
watching this video now this is 15

2911
01:54:12,430 --> 01:54:15,610
minutes later I don't know if this is 15

2912
01:54:14,260 --> 01:54:17,920
minutes from the time they took the bong

2913
01:54:15,609 --> 01:54:19,359
hit or if this is 15 minutes from the

2914
01:54:17,920 --> 01:54:21,010
clip that we just saw which would put

2915
01:54:19,359 --> 01:54:22,869
them about 20 minutes into this stoned

2916
01:54:21,010 --> 01:54:24,310
adventure so I'm gonna hit play turn the

2917
01:54:22,869 --> 01:54:26,319
volume up again and we will see what

2918
01:54:24,310 --> 01:54:30,039
these old guys are up to

2919
01:54:26,319 --> 01:54:37,649
and that's the clock so now they're

2920
01:54:30,039 --> 01:54:37,649
smoking enjoy a montage 25 minutes later

2921
01:54:37,909 --> 01:54:41,619
[Music]

2922
01:54:39,600 --> 01:54:46,000
now they're gonna try to do sobriety

2923
01:54:41,619 --> 01:54:47,380
tests ninety eighty six and the question

2924
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:49,689
he just asked him is plus some pieces

2925
01:54:47,380 --> 01:55:02,770
starting at ninety three count backwards

2926
01:54:49,689 --> 01:55:04,210
by seven so now they're doing the hold

2927
01:55:02,770 --> 01:55:10,960
your leg up test and the guy couldn't do

2928
01:55:04,210 --> 01:55:13,810
five seconds yeah he said better than

2929
01:55:10,960 --> 01:55:15,189
before ha this dude was doing a heel to

2930
01:55:13,810 --> 01:55:16,600
toe test a minute ago and I said that he

2931
01:55:15,189 --> 01:55:17,979
was [ __ ] it up cuz his knees were so

2932
01:55:16,600 --> 01:55:19,570
bad now that he smoked a little bit of

2933
01:55:17,979 --> 01:55:21,099
reefer this dude just nailed the heel to

2934
01:55:19,569 --> 01:55:23,139
toe test cuz his pain doesn't hurt in

2935
01:55:21,100 --> 01:55:25,000
his knees anymore so they accidentally

2936
01:55:23,140 --> 01:55:26,050
found a good reason to use marijuana

2937
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:28,779
alright I'm gonna hit play on the video

2938
01:55:26,050 --> 01:55:33,210
again we'll keep going I feel a little

2939
01:55:28,779 --> 01:55:38,920
floaty it's not unpleasant but it's

2940
01:55:33,210 --> 01:55:44,590
shadowed by the faint discomfort of not

2941
01:55:38,920 --> 01:55:46,119
being fully what police officers do

2942
01:55:44,590 --> 01:55:47,529
they're very staunch they're very in

2943
01:55:46,119 --> 01:55:50,109
control all the time this doesn't

2944
01:55:47,529 --> 01:55:51,699
necessarily allow you to do that this is

2945
01:55:50,109 --> 01:55:54,489
actually pretty comfortable though I

2946
01:55:51,699 --> 01:55:56,880
mean it's relaxed and I don't feel like

2947
01:55:54,489 --> 01:56:00,639
I have to be in control it's pretty cool

2948
01:55:56,880 --> 01:56:03,310
so this guy's enjoying it it's

2949
01:56:00,640 --> 01:56:04,630
legalizing marijuana is that it takes I

2950
01:56:03,310 --> 01:56:05,650
mean some of the stuff you can buy on

2951
01:56:04,630 --> 01:56:07,090
the street now you never know what it's

2952
01:56:05,649 --> 01:56:08,559
cut with I don't agree with that he's

2953
01:56:07,090 --> 01:56:09,460
claiming that marijuana is cut with

2954
01:56:08,560 --> 01:56:17,350
stuff which is weird

2955
01:56:09,460 --> 01:56:21,010
but well yeah and also custom you know

2956
01:56:17,350 --> 01:56:23,490
put somebody in prison and I jail the

2957
01:56:21,010 --> 01:56:23,489
prison

2958
01:56:24,170 --> 01:56:27,980
Harvard here that it costs more to put

2959
01:56:26,569 --> 01:56:29,509
somebody in prison than listen man to

2960
01:56:27,979 --> 01:56:40,579
Harvard rather playing the game where

2961
01:56:29,510 --> 01:56:42,079
you put a card on your name would you do

2962
01:56:40,579 --> 01:56:43,488
it again is the question and here's

2963
01:56:42,079 --> 01:56:45,500
their responses I'm letting the YouTube

2964
01:56:43,488 --> 01:56:47,299
video load I told my son on the way over

2965
01:56:45,500 --> 01:56:49,810
here I was I had a pretty good headache

2966
01:56:47,300 --> 01:56:56,210
coming on and I think my headaches are

2967
01:56:49,810 --> 01:56:57,380
going away I don't know given the right

2968
01:56:56,210 --> 01:57:00,948
circumstances I suppose

2969
01:56:57,380 --> 01:57:02,510
yeah I'll smoke again probably given the

2970
01:57:00,948 --> 01:57:12,198
opportunity so all three of these guys

2971
01:57:02,510 --> 01:57:14,390
said they will smoke again they're doing

2972
01:57:12,198 --> 01:57:16,549
a montage of these three older dudes

2973
01:57:14,390 --> 01:57:18,530
taking bong hits and smoking a joint and

2974
01:57:16,550 --> 01:57:20,630
it looks like like they're trying to

2975
01:57:18,529 --> 01:57:24,019
make it a scene from the hangover or

2976
01:57:20,630 --> 01:57:25,279
something that's pretty good because I

2977
01:57:24,020 --> 01:57:26,840
honestly don't know how much I was

2978
01:57:25,279 --> 01:57:28,789
allowed to play of that video without

2979
01:57:26,840 --> 01:57:30,289

2988
01:57:44,869 --> 01:57:47,569
you're gonna want to watch it yourself

2989
01:57:46,039 --> 01:57:49,010
alright now that we've gotten through

2990
01:57:47,569 --> 01:57:51,380
watching that video let me talk about it

2991
01:57:49,010 --> 01:57:53,390
a little bit uh one thing I really liked

2992
01:57:51,380 --> 01:57:54,920
is that these dudes seemed open-minded

2993
01:57:53,390 --> 01:57:56,270
they didn't remind me of a lot of the

2994
01:57:54,920 --> 01:57:57,949
cops that I've dealt with that are real

2995
01:57:56,270 --> 01:57:59,719
standoffish and think they have to be in

2996
01:57:57,948 --> 01:58:01,549
control of everything the one cop

2997
01:57:59,719 --> 01:58:03,109
actually said that that's a cop's job is

2998
01:58:01,550 --> 01:58:04,880
to be in control and once he smoked a

2999
01:58:03,109 --> 01:58:06,679
little bit of reefer he wanted to relax

3000
01:58:04,880 --> 01:58:09,590
and lighten up and not be such a prick

3001
01:58:06,679 --> 01:58:11,869
of a cop so I liked that he was open

3002
01:58:09,590 --> 01:58:13,489
minded and wanted to participate I like

3003
01:58:11,869 --> 01:58:15,469
that the one guy said it should be legal

3004
01:58:13,488 --> 01:58:17,599
and then what I really liked was that

3005
01:58:15,469 --> 01:58:19,698
they all wanted to smoke again they said

3006
01:58:17,600 --> 01:58:21,800
yes we would do this again so maybe

3007
01:58:19,698 --> 01:58:23,389
those cops are gonna go talk to one of

3008
01:58:21,800 --> 01:58:24,650
their friends who is still a cop and be

3009
01:58:23,390 --> 01:58:25,969
like you know what dude we got stoned on

3010
01:58:24,649 --> 01:58:27,710
this video and it's not as bad as you

3011
01:58:25,969 --> 01:58:29,300
think maybe one of their friends is

3012
01:58:27,710 --> 01:58:31,279
gonna watch this video maybe this video

3013
01:58:29,300 --> 01:58:32,710
is going to help people change their

3014
01:58:31,279 --> 01:58:34,599
opinions of cannabis

3015
01:58:32,710 --> 01:58:36,219
and even if even if you're already a fan

3016
01:58:34,600 --> 01:58:37,930
of cannabis I recommend watching it

3017
01:58:36,219 --> 01:58:39,430
because it was highly entertaining big

3018
01:58:37,930 --> 01:58:41,260
shout outs whoever sent that video to me

3019
01:58:39,430 --> 01:58:42,100
I do not remember who it was but I

3020
01:58:41,260 --> 01:58:43,390
appreciate it

3021
01:58:42,100 --> 01:58:44,620
alright that's enough of the video I've

3022
01:58:43,390 --> 01:58:47,680
got a few news articles that I'd like to

3023
01:58:44,619 --> 01:58:49,090
share with you guys um this article will

3024
01:58:47,680 --> 01:58:50,860
just jump right to it this article comes

3025
01:58:49,090 --> 01:58:54,489
from the pueblos chief 10 and it is

3026
01:58:50,859 --> 01:58:57,219
written by Dan Sita no it's actually

3027
01:58:54,488 --> 01:58:59,589
written by Kristin Emma white so the

3028
01:58:57,219 --> 01:59:01,390
headline says extra marijuana tax money

3029
01:58:59,590 --> 01:59:02,829
set to hit the roads and I've talked a

3030
01:59:01,390 --> 01:59:04,840
little bit about this in previous shows

3031
01:59:02,829 --> 01:59:06,850
and it is finally happening this was my

3032
01:59:04,840 --> 01:59:07,930
recommendation and now here you go

3033
01:59:06,850 --> 01:59:10,420

3034

3036
01:59:11,770 --> 01:59:15,040
hundred thousand dollars on roads in the

3037
01:59:13,270 --> 01:59:16,630
community for the remainder of the year

3038
01:59:15,039 --> 01:59:18,939

the board recently the extra money comes

3041
01:59:21,250 --> 01:59:23,380
from

3042
01:59:21,488 --> 01:59:25,119
after directors agreed to allocate the

3043
01:59:23,380 --> 01:59:27,190
two hundred thousand dollars it received

3044
01:59:25,119 --> 01:59:28,869
from Pueblo County for marijuana tax

3045
01:59:27,189 --> 01:59:31,029
money toward chip ceiling already

3046
01:59:28,869 --> 01:59:33,279
planned this county will pay the 200

3047
01:59:31,029 --> 01:59:35,349
thousand dollars directly to its

3048
01:59:33,279 --> 01:59:37,449

highest need we have in the district

3054
01:59:44,859 --> 01:59:49,089
right now has to do with gravel roads

3055
01:59:47,020 --> 01:59:50,770
need to toll directors we have six point

3056
01:59:49,090 --> 01:59:52,690
two miles of gravel roads that when we

3057
01:59:50,770 --> 01:59:54,910
have the storms we've had this spring

3058
01:59:52,689 --> 01:59:58,179
the clay underneath fails and some

3059
01:59:54,909 --> 01:59:59,800
stretches are impassable it would be our

3060
01:59:58,180 --> 02:00:01,390
intent to start attacking the repair of

3061
01:59:59,800 --> 02:00:03,489
those roads as soon as possible we

3062
02:00:01,390 --> 02:00:06,310
propose to bring an additional staff

3063
02:00:03,488 --> 02:00:08,259
equipment and additional gravel so I

3064
02:00:06,310 --> 02:00:09,580
have recommended this several times you

3065
02:00:08,260 --> 02:00:11,079
guys I've said that we should take all

3066
02:00:09,579 --> 02:00:12,880
this tax money that we're making here in

3067
02:00:11,079 --> 02:00:15,850
Pueblo Colorado and fix some of the

3068
02:00:12,880 --> 02:00:17,710
goddamn potholes all over the roads well

3069
02:00:15,850 --> 02:00:19,539
guess what they have heard us the people

3070
02:00:17,710 --> 02:00:21,279
have spoken the people listened and now

3071
02:00:19,539 --> 02:00:23,350
they're going to fix the roads with all

3072
02:00:21,279 --> 02:00:25,059
of that tax money so a big shout out to

3073
02:00:23,350 --> 02:00:26,320
the city of Pueblo for actually doing

3074
02:00:25,060 --> 02:00:27,460
something about the roads of course

3075
02:00:26,319 --> 02:00:28,238
they're starting with dirt roads that

3076
02:00:27,460 --> 02:00:30,460
are impassable

3077
02:00:28,238 --> 02:00:32,529
but once those are done they're going to

3078
02:00:30,460 --> 02:00:34,270
fix the potholes in my city so that my

3079
02:00:32,529 --> 02:00:36,519
car will not sound like [ __ ] when I

3080
02:00:34,270 --> 02:00:37,870
Drive thank you

3081
02:00:36,520 --> 02:00:40,030
it's about time all right here's another

3082
02:00:37,869 --> 02:00:42,189
news article this one comes from Denver

3083
02:00:40,029 --> 02:00:43,659
I actually found this news article in

3084
02:00:42,189 --> 02:00:45,879
the Pueblo chieftain and big shout out

3085
02:00:43,659 --> 02:00:46,359
to Mike make sure you guys follow an emo

3086
02:00:45,880 --> 02:00:48,069
Punk

3087
02:00:46,359 --> 02:00:50,380
I think it's an evil punk 15 on Twitter

3088
02:00:48,069 --> 02:00:52,840
Mike sends me a lot of news articles I

3089
02:00:50,380 --> 02:00:55,060
appreciate it thanks a lot dude we'll

3090
02:00:52,840 --> 02:00:57,340
get right to this article the headline

3091
02:00:55,060 --> 02:00:59,080
is raising the bars for pot and this is

3092
02:00:57,340 --> 02:01:00,850
something else that we've been talking

3093
02:00:59,079 --> 02:01:03,279
about and hinting at on the podcast and

3094
02:01:00,850 --> 02:01:05,050
things are finally coming around so the

3095
02:01:03,279 --> 02:01:07,960
sub headline says Denver campaign

3096
02:01:05,050 --> 02:01:10,929
promoting promoting use in 21 and over

3097
02:01:07,960 --> 02:01:13,750
21 establishments this article is by

3098
02:01:10,929 --> 02:01:17,079
Kristen Wyatt of The Associated Press

3099
02:01:13,750 --> 02:01:18,908
and then it says Denver beer wine or we

3100
02:01:17,079 --> 02:01:20,289
campaign is underway to ask Denver

3101
02:01:18,908 --> 02:01:22,000
voters about allowing marijuana

3102
02:01:20,289 --> 02:01:25,090
consumption in bars and other places

3103
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:26,618
that only allow people over 21 activists

3104
02:01:25,090 --> 02:01:28,480
who campaign for recreational pot

3105
02:01:26,618 --> 02:01:30,908
legalization in Colorado have launched a

3106
02:01:28,479 --> 02:01:33,549
petition to drive what they call limited

3107
02:01:30,908 --> 02:01:36,129
social marijuana consumption at bars the

3108
02:01:33,550 --> 02:01:37,869
activists need about 5000 signatures to

3109
02:01:36,130 --> 02:01:40,900
get the question on November ballots

3110
02:01:37,868 --> 02:01:42,880
it would allow bars or clubs to allow

3111
02:01:40,899 --> 02:01:44,649
marijuana use as long as patrons bring

3112
02:01:42,880 --> 02:01:46,659
their own weed and comply with clean air

3113
02:01:44,649 --> 02:01:48,519
laws that means the pot they consume

3114
02:01:46,658 --> 02:01:50,589
would have to be edible or if smoked

3115
02:01:48,520 --> 02:01:52,380
consumed on an outside patio the way

3116
02:01:50,590 --> 02:01:54,670
cigarette smoking is regulated now

3117
02:01:52,380 --> 02:01:57,340
outdoor smoking sites would have to be

3118
02:01:54,670 --> 02:01:58,868
shielded from public view so if you guys

3119
02:01:57,340 --> 02:02:01,779
don't know about the Clean Air Act in

3120
02:01:58,868 --> 02:02:03,309
Colorado you are not allowed to smoke in

3121
02:02:01,779 --> 02:02:05,500
a restaurant or anywhere that serves

3122
02:02:03,310 --> 02:02:08,440
food or basically where the public is

3123
02:02:05,500 --> 02:02:10,420
you have to get a [ __ ] I don't know the

3124
02:02:08,439 --> 02:02:12,368
word tobacco shops have them but you

3125
02:02:10,420 --> 02:02:14,079
have to get like a smoking license like

3126
02:02:12,368 --> 02:02:15,639
a tobacco shop or a cigarette shop if

3127
02:02:14,079 --> 02:02:17,170
you want to smoke in there they apply

3128
02:02:15,639 --> 02:02:20,920
for a permit and you're able to smoke in

3129
02:02:17,170 --> 02:02:22,868
there so with the Clean Air Act we are

3130
02:02:20,920 --> 02:02:24,609
not able to smoke cannabis inside of a

3131
02:02:22,868 --> 02:02:26,198
building even if they do allow it we're

3132
02:02:24,609 --> 02:02:27,789
going to have to step outside to an

3133
02:02:26,198 --> 02:02:29,649
outdoor area that is shielded from

3134
02:02:27,789 --> 02:02:31,269
public view so I'll jump into the

3135
02:02:29,649 --> 02:02:33,638
article a little bit more here it says

3136
02:02:31,270 --> 02:02:34,719
marijuana is now it I don't know how

3137
02:02:33,639 --> 02:02:36,489
they I don't like how they worded that

3138
02:02:34,719 --> 02:02:38,020
I'm gonna read it the way it should have

3139
02:02:36,488 --> 02:02:39,849
been written it says marijuana is now a

3140
02:02:38,020 --> 02:02:41,619
legal product for adults in Denver and

3141
02:02:39,850 --> 02:02:43,150
it's really time that we give adults a

3142
02:02:41,618 --> 02:02:45,339
place to use it legally and socially

3143
02:02:43,149 --> 02:02:47,229
cent Mason toover who ran Colorado's

3144
02:02:45,340 --> 02:02:49,810
2012 campaign to legalize recreational

3145
02:02:47,229 --> 02:02:51,189
pot we shouldn't be requiring that you

3146
02:02:49,810 --> 02:02:53,380
sit at home if you choose to use

3147
02:02:51,189 --> 02:02:54,759
marijuana as an adult and I completely

3148
02:02:53,380 --> 02:02:56,679
agree with that you guys there are so

3149
02:02:54,760 --> 02:02:57,289
many places to buy tank buds in Colorado

3150
02:02:56,679 --> 02:02:59,510
but there's no

3151
02:02:57,289 --> 02:03:01,100
or to legally go smoke it so this would

3152
02:02:59,510 --> 02:03:02,930
change a lot of things and I think it

3153
02:03:01,100 --> 02:03:04,550
would promote business people I wouldn't

3154
02:03:02,930 --> 02:03:06,289
go to a bar I have no reason to go to a

3155
02:03:04,550 --> 02:03:07,670
bar I don't drink alcohol I don't want

3156
02:03:06,289 --> 02:03:09,079
anything to do with bar girls I don't

3157
02:03:07,670 --> 02:03:10,760
want to do with bar dudes I don't like

3158
02:03:09,079 --> 02:03:12,260
drunk people but if I could go to that

3159
02:03:10,760 --> 02:03:13,640
club and hang out and take a couple of

3160
02:03:12,260 --> 02:03:15,020
dabs and hang out with my friends that

3161
02:03:13,640 --> 02:03:16,789
are drinking I would be way more

3162
02:03:15,020 --> 02:03:18,170
inclined to go to the bar and then I'd

3163
02:03:16,789 --> 02:03:21,199
spend a few bucks there because I'd have

3164
02:03:18,170 --> 02:03:22,880
to buy a soda or some sort of juice or

3165
02:03:21,199 --> 02:03:24,500
[ __ ] to keep my mouth hydrated while I'm

3166
02:03:22,880 --> 02:03:26,029
dabbing but anyway we'll keep going with

3167
02:03:24,500 --> 02:03:27,949
the article Colorado law prohibits

3168
02:03:26,029 --> 02:03:30,019
recreational pot consumption openly and

3169
02:03:27,949 --> 02:03:32,420
publicly or in a matter that dangers

3170
02:03:30,020 --> 02:03:35,180
others it does not however bar against

3171
02:03:32,420 --> 02:03:36,949
consumption in private over 21 clubs the

3172
02:03:35,180 --> 02:03:39,050
Denver measure would clarify what counts

3173
02:03:36,949 --> 02:03:40,340
is a private club and that's something

3174
02:03:39,050 --> 02:03:42,190
we've been struggling with here a lot in

3175
02:03:40,340 --> 02:03:44,270
Colorado is getting a private club

3176
02:03:42,189 --> 02:03:47,359
marijuana dispensaries are banned from

3177
02:03:44,270 --> 02:03:48,950
allowing on use on site use of products

3178
02:03:47,359 --> 02:03:51,559
they sell and from selling alcohol or

3179
02:03:48,949 --> 02:03:53,539
food that doesn't contain pot the Denver

3180
02:03:51,560 --> 02:03:56,480
proposal would only allow bring your own

3181
02:03:53,539 --> 02:03:58,239
consumption Denver wouldn't be the first

3182
02:03:56,479 --> 02:04:00,589
city to allow marijuana in bars

3183
02:03:58,239 --> 02:04:03,529
Netherland has a state statute allowing

3184
02:04:00,590 --> 02:04:06,680
limited on-site consumption at over 21

3185
02:04:03,529 --> 02:04:08,899
clubs you can go smoke I didn't know

3186
02:04:06,680 --> 02:04:10,490
about that and Colorado Springs the

3187
02:04:08,899 --> 02:04:12,589
state's second largest city has several

3188
02:04:10,489 --> 02:04:14,479
marijuana marijuana clubs that are

3189
02:04:12,590 --> 02:04:16,880
tolerated if not specifically allowed by

3190
02:04:14,479 --> 02:04:18,799
statute Colorado Springs Mayor John

3191
02:04:16,880 --> 02:04:20,329
Suthers has told the City Council that

3192
02:04:18,800 --> 02:04:21,710
he plans to seek regulations on the

3193
02:04:20,329 --> 02:04:24,850
clubs to get a Gazette newspaper

3194
02:04:21,710 --> 02:04:27,439
recently reported I've been to three

3195
02:04:24,850 --> 02:04:30,200
marijuana cannabis smoking social clubs

3196
02:04:27,439 --> 02:04:31,309
in Colorado Springs and you know it's

3197
02:04:30,199 --> 02:04:33,439
kind of cool to be able to go and hang

3198
02:04:31,310 --> 02:04:34,190
out and just smoke there is the 4/20

3199
02:04:33,439 --> 02:04:35,929
speakeasy

3200
02:04:34,189 --> 02:04:38,659
there's the lazy lion and then there's

3201
02:04:35,930 --> 02:04:40,850
the original speakeasy and you as a an

3202
02:04:38,659 --> 02:04:44,000
adult 21 or over can go into these

3203
02:04:40,850 --> 02:04:46,039
places and you can have a dab of your

3204
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:48,229
own out of their rig you can bring your

3205
02:04:46,039 --> 02:04:50,359
rig or a lot of them have a DAB bar that

3206
02:04:48,229 --> 02:04:51,679
will sell you dabs some of them you have

3207
02:04:50,359 --> 02:04:53,269
to pay a little fee to get in a little

3208
02:04:51,680 --> 02:04:54,470
cover charge but if you're an

3209
02:04:53,270 --> 02:04:55,400
out-of-towner and you want to come hang

3210
02:04:54,470 --> 02:04:57,230
out and take some dabs with some

3211
02:04:55,399 --> 02:04:58,549
Colorado kids now there's nothing wrong

3212
02:04:57,229 --> 02:05:00,769
with going to one of those places it's

3213
02:04:58,550 --> 02:05:02,480
actually pretty damn fun I ended up in a

3214
02:05:00,770 --> 02:05:04,760
kind of a secretive place in Denver

3215
02:05:02,479 --> 02:05:06,769
taking dabs all night at a speakeasy up

3216
02:05:04,760 --> 02:05:08,659
there and it's just fun hanging out

3217
02:05:06,770 --> 02:05:10,580
taking dabs in the club we just replaced

3218
02:05:08,659 --> 02:05:11,090
alcohol with dads and it's way fun I

3219
02:05:10,579 --> 02:05:13,550
really do

3220
02:05:11,090 --> 02:05:16,940
for some reason all right I need to

3221
02:05:13,550 --> 02:05:18,890
continue with this article where are we

3222
02:05:16,939 --> 02:05:21,369
the Denver petition comes after that

3223
02:05:18,890 --> 02:05:23,510
City Council rejected pot friendly bars

3224
02:05:21,369 --> 02:05:24,949
Denver has several underground clubs

3225
02:05:23,510 --> 02:05:26,570
where patrons use marijuana for a

3226
02:05:24,949 --> 02:05:28,340
joining fee but the city has

3227
02:05:26,569 --> 02:05:30,729
intermittently arrested people for

3228
02:05:28,340 --> 02:05:33,050
public consumption at those clubs

3229
02:05:30,729 --> 02:05:34,159
arresting for smoking weed again wait

3230
02:05:33,050 --> 02:05:36,020
that's not we're past that

3231
02:05:34,159 --> 02:05:37,609
anyway the raids and arrests leave

3232
02:05:36,020 --> 02:05:39,230
tourists with nowhere to legally consume

3233
02:05:37,609 --> 02:05:41,029
pot they've bought argued supporters of

3234
02:05:39,229 --> 02:05:42,949
the ballot measure among the supporters

3235
02:05:41,029 --> 02:05:44,840
is Jane West and events promoter who

3236
02:05:42,949 --> 02:05:46,429
last year arranged classically cannabis

3237
02:05:44,840 --> 02:05:48,680
concert with the Colorado Symphony

3238
02:05:46,430 --> 02:05:50,659
Orchestra the city threatened to block

3239
02:05:48,680 --> 02:05:53,300
the concert citing publican consumption

3240
02:05:50,659 --> 02:05:54,800
laws the symphony rebranded the concerts

3241
02:05:53,300 --> 02:05:56,570
as a private bring your own cannabis

3242
02:05:54,800 --> 02:05:58,970
fundraiser and the city dropped its

3243
02:05:56,569 --> 02:06:00,859
objections West was convicted of a

3244
02:05:58,970 --> 02:06:02,420
misdemeanor for organizing a separate

3245
02:06:00,859 --> 02:06:05,000
cannabis friendly event last year a

3246
02:06:02,420 --> 02:06:06,560
brunch at a bakery and a person swat

3247
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:08,569
team descended on the event and shut

3248
02:06:06,560 --> 02:06:10,190
down the brunch West said West became

3249
02:06:08,569 --> 02:06:13,130
one of the first to sign the Denver

3250
02:06:10,189 --> 02:06:16,009
petition the petitions are due by early

3251
02:06:13,130 --> 02:06:17,779
August so where's this petition because

3252
02:06:16,010 --> 02:06:19,850
everybody here in Colorado needs to sign

3253
02:06:17,779 --> 02:06:21,949
this if you listen to this podcast you

3254
02:06:19,850 --> 02:06:24,770
agree with me that we need to allow

3255
02:06:21,949 --> 02:06:27,260
recreational consumption in 21 and over

3256
02:06:24,770 --> 02:06:30,800
establishments for adults out of public

3257
02:06:27,260 --> 02:06:32,329
view out of indoor smoking areas so that

3258
02:06:30,800 --> 02:06:33,829
we're able to medicate if we're a

3259
02:06:32,329 --> 02:06:35,600
medical patient or we're able to

3260
02:06:33,829 --> 02:06:37,430
recreative we're a recreational smoker

3261
02:06:35,600 --> 02:06:39,530
we should be able to puffs that people

3262
02:06:37,430 --> 02:06:42,440
are at the bars getting wasted doing

3263
02:06:39,529 --> 02:06:44,779
shots [ __ ] getting drunk getting into

3264
02:06:42,439 --> 02:06:46,069
fights raping each other being heathens

3265
02:06:44,779 --> 02:06:47,659
but the people that want to smoke a

3266
02:06:46,069 --> 02:06:49,759
little bit of weed and relax or being

3267
02:06:47,659 --> 02:06:51,920
singled out and I think it sucks and

3268
02:06:49,760 --> 02:06:53,720
it's time for a revolution it's time for

3269
02:06:51,920 --> 02:06:55,489
us to be able to smoke in these clubs

3270
02:06:53,720 --> 02:06:57,170
where we want to go I think it'd be a

3271
02:06:55,489 --> 02:06:59,689
good idea I think it's kind of done that

3272
02:06:57,170 --> 02:07:01,250
they don't allow it alright big shout

3273
02:06:59,689 --> 02:07:03,199
out to the pueblos chief then big shout

3274
02:07:01,250 --> 02:07:04,520

3275

3278
02:07:08,810 --> 02:07:12,530

3279
02:07:10,729 --> 02:07:14,238
somewhere and we need to sign it each

3280
02:07:12,529 --> 02:07:17,329

3281

3282
02:07:17,329 --> 02:07:20,600

3283
02:07:19,010 --> 02:07:24,110
little bit long let me see how much time

3284
02:07:20,600 --> 02:07:26,810
I have got left here in this show so um

3285
02:07:24,109 --> 02:07:29,479
we've talked recently about the

3286
02:07:26,810 --> 02:07:31,820
discussion between the natives and the

3287
02:07:29,479 --> 02:07:34,549
government to allow natives to grow

3288
02:07:31,819 --> 02:07:37,849
cannabis on native land or Indian

3289
02:07:34,550 --> 02:07:40,039
reservations recently federal agents

3290
02:07:37,850 --> 02:07:42,110

3291
02:07:40,039 --> 02:07:45,050

3292
02:07:42,109 --> 02:07:47,420
Modoc County so this article comes from

3293
02:07:45,050 --> 02:07:50,270
where is this this is actually from KRC

3294
02:07:47,420 --> 02:07:53,390
tv.com which is a TV station in southern

3295
02:07:50,270 --> 02:07:55,580
california and there is no let's see

3296
02:07:53,390 --> 02:07:57,050
Megan Hunt is the author so let's read

3297
02:07:55,579 --> 02:07:58,969
this article it says federal agents

3298
02:07:57,050 --> 02:08:00,949
raided what appeared to be a large-scale

3299
02:07:58,969 --> 02:08:03,350
commercial marijuana grow on the Pitt

3300
02:08:00,949 --> 02:08:04,909
River XL reservation and the alterus

3301
02:08:03,350 --> 02:08:07,250
reservation in Modoc County on Wednesday

3302
02:08:04,909 --> 02:08:09,050
morning photos from the scene showed

3303
02:08:07,250 --> 02:08:11,359
dozens of law enforcement vehicles at a

3304
02:08:09,050 --> 02:08:13,100
large greenhouse site there's also one

3305
02:08:11,359 --> 02:08:15,199
photo of a bulldozer with what appears

3306
02:08:13,100 --> 02:08:17,480
to be a load of marijuana plants in its

3307
02:08:15,199 --> 02:08:20,630
bucket according to lauren Horwood of

3308
02:08:17,479 --> 02:08:21,919
the USA the US Attorney's Office special

3309
02:08:20,630 --> 02:08:23,270
agents with the Bureau of Indian Affairs

3310
02:08:21,920 --> 02:08:25,460
and the Drug Enforcement Administration

3311
02:08:23,270 --> 02:08:27,469
and other federal states and local

3312
02:08:25,460 --> 02:08:28,730
agencies conducted a search of two

3313
02:08:27,469 --> 02:08:31,159
large-scale marijuana cultivation

3314
02:08:28,729 --> 02:08:33,349
facilities located on federally

3315
02:08:31,159 --> 02:08:37,250
recognized tribal lands at the alterus

3316
02:08:33,350 --> 02:08:39,110
Indian Ranch area and the Excel ranch at

3317
02:08:37,250 --> 02:08:41,569
both sites law enforcement seized a

3318
02:08:39,109 --> 02:08:43,130
total of at least 12,000 marijuana

3319
02:08:41,569 --> 02:08:45,259
plants and over a hundred pounds of

3320
02:08:43,130 --> 02:08:46,850
processed marijuana other than the

3321
02:08:45,260 --> 02:08:49,400
contraband marijuana and items of

3322
02:08:46,850 --> 02:08:51,079
evidentiary value no tribal property was

3323
02:08:49,399 --> 02:08:53,329
seized and no federal charges are

3324
02:08:51,079 --> 02:08:54,500
printing Horowitz said she explained

3325
02:08:53,329 --> 02:08:56,269
that the search warrants are part of an

3326
02:08:54,500 --> 02:08:57,800
ongoing investigation relating to the

3327
02:08:56,270 --> 02:09:00,560
financing and management of a commercial

3328
02:08:57,800 --> 02:09:03,260
marijuana cultivation project the

3329
02:09:00,560 --> 02:09:05,570
project warrant affidavits were unsealed

3330
02:09:03,260 --> 02:09:07,070
until today or would also said that

3331
02:09:05,569 --> 02:09:08,199
while the US Attorney's Office doesn't

3332
02:09:07,069 --> 02:09:10,309
normally comment on ongoing

3333
02:09:08,199 --> 02:09:11,750
investigations because of the public

3334
02:09:10,310 --> 02:09:13,820
nature of this rate they are releasing

3335
02:09:11,750 --> 02:09:15,170
information she explained that marijuana

3336
02:09:13,819 --> 02:09:17,539
growers have received substantial

3337
02:09:15,170 --> 02:09:19,640
attention in Modoc County as well as the

3338
02:09:17,539 --> 02:09:21,469
US Department of Justice's guidance

3339
02:09:19,640 --> 02:09:23,159
relating to marijuana cultivation on

3340
02:09:21,469 --> 02:09:24,989
tribal lands

3341
02:09:23,158 --> 02:09:27,329
the cultivation facility at alterus

3342
02:09:24,988 --> 02:09:29,669
Indian ranch area was located within the

3343
02:09:27,329 --> 02:09:32,519
tribes former Event Center with within

3344
02:09:29,670 --> 02:09:34,739
approximately 100 yards of the tribes

3345
02:09:32,520 --> 02:09:36,870
publicly operated gaming facility the

3346
02:09:34,738 --> 02:09:39,509
Desert Rose casino so these guys were

3347
02:09:36,869 --> 02:09:41,309
growing a major grow a hundred yards

3348
02:09:39,510 --> 02:09:43,469
from the Desert Rose casino where people

3349
02:09:41,310 --> 02:09:45,989
go all day and gamble all day that's

3350
02:09:43,469 --> 02:09:48,060
kind of kind of funny to me the facility

3351
02:09:45,988 --> 02:09:49,888
on the excel ranch was next to highway

3352
02:09:48,060 --> 02:09:51,900
395 on the banks of the Pitt River

3353
02:09:49,889 --> 02:09:53,730
Horwood explains the Pitt River facility

3354
02:09:51,899 --> 02:09:56,099
consisted of 40 newly constructed

3355
02:09:53,729 --> 02:09:58,408
greenhouse structures each capable of

3356
02:09:56,100 --> 02:10:00,630
accommodating approximately 1,000

3357
02:09:58,408 --> 02:10:02,789
marijuana plants and additional gable

3358
02:10:00,630 --> 02:10:04,800
roof structures that boosted the square

3359
02:10:02,789 --> 02:10:07,439
footage of roof covered structures by

3360
02:10:04,800 --> 02:10:09,389
another 50 percent that is a lot of

3361
02:10:07,439 --> 02:10:11,519
plants you guys this dude had 40 green

3362
02:10:09,389 --> 02:10:13,679
of this operation had 40 greenhouses

3363
02:10:11,520 --> 02:10:15,449
with a thousand plants each that's the

3364
02:10:13,679 --> 02:10:17,969
potential of 40,000 plants in those

3365
02:10:15,448 --> 02:10:19,500
greenhouses plus stuff that was covered

3366
02:10:17,969 --> 02:10:21,750
that increases their square footage by

3367
02:10:19,500 --> 02:10:23,488
50 percent which is another 20,000

3368
02:10:21,750 --> 02:10:26,460
plants if you do it mathematically I

3369
02:10:23,488 --> 02:10:27,988
think all right I'll keep going both of

3370
02:10:26,460 --> 02:10:29,520
the girl operations which appear to have

3371
02:10:27,988 --> 02:10:31,619
been operating in conjunction with each

3372
02:10:29,520 --> 02:10:33,389
other and we're in excess of the locally

3373
02:10:31,619 --> 02:10:36,569
enacted marijuana cultivation limits

3374
02:10:33,389 --> 02:10:38,579
applicable to county land Horowitz said

3375
02:10:36,569 --> 02:10:40,408
I feel like I read something about they

3376
02:10:38,579 --> 02:10:41,850
were they were both in excess of the

3377
02:10:40,408 --> 02:10:44,009
locally enacted marijuana cultivation

3378
02:10:41,850 --> 02:10:46,289
limits so that's something that's kind

3379
02:10:44,010 --> 02:10:48,150
of if you're allowed to grow cannabis if

3380
02:10:46,289 --> 02:10:50,460
you're able to do that legally without

3381
02:10:48,149 --> 02:10:51,988
being [ __ ] with by the government stay

3382
02:10:50,460 --> 02:10:53,340
within your damn limits why don't you

3383
02:10:51,988 --> 02:10:54,569
just stay in the limits these guys were

3384
02:10:53,340 --> 02:10:55,949
over there limits they're growing too

3385
02:10:54,569 --> 02:10:58,408
much and that's what got them in trouble

3386
02:10:55,948 --> 02:11:00,178
which is a sign of greed and selfishness

3387
02:10:58,408 --> 02:11:01,888
and not drawing from your heart and

3388
02:11:00,179 --> 02:11:03,239
drawing from your wallet all right we're

3389
02:11:01,889 --> 02:11:05,579
gonna keep going on the article it says

3390
02:11:03,238 --> 02:11:07,250
the volume of marijuana that the Excel

3391
02:11:05,579 --> 02:11:10,050
facility alone was capable of producing

3392
02:11:07,250 --> 02:11:12,539
estimated a prop approximately forty to

3393
02:11:10,050 --> 02:11:14,279
sixty thousand plants far exceeds any

3394
02:11:12,539 --> 02:11:16,710
prior known commercial marijuana grow

3395
02:11:14,279 --> 02:11:19,800
operation anywhere within the 34 County

3396
02:11:16,710 --> 02:11:21,210
Eastern District she added according to

3397
02:11:19,800 --> 02:11:23,070
tribal representatives all of the

3398
02:11:21,210 --> 02:11:25,139
marijuana cultivated at both both

3399
02:11:23,069 --> 02:11:27,090
facilities was intended to be

3400
02:11:25,139 --> 02:11:29,400
distributed off of tribal lands at

3401
02:11:27,090 --> 02:11:31,199
various unidentified locations according

3402
02:11:29,399 --> 02:11:33,059
to the search warrant affidavit the

3403
02:11:31,198 --> 02:11:35,348
investigation to date indicates both

3404
02:11:33,060 --> 02:11:37,809
operations may have been financed by a

3405
02:11:35,349 --> 02:11:40,389
third party foreign national you guys I

3406
02:11:37,809 --> 02:11:42,729
actually found these search warrants on

3407
02:11:40,389 --> 02:11:44,168
Facebook for some reason I was scrolling

3408
02:11:42,729 --> 02:11:47,409
through Facebook and somebody happened

3409
02:11:44,168 --> 02:11:48,939
to post the search warrants and for some

3410
02:11:47,408 --> 02:11:50,378
reason I was completely enthralled with

3411
02:11:48,939 --> 02:11:52,628
reading these search warrants and it was

3412
02:11:50,378 --> 02:11:54,519
completely entertaining for some reason

3413
02:11:52,628 --> 02:11:56,408
I could not get my head out of it but

3414
02:11:54,519 --> 02:11:59,050
they said that this third party foreign

3415
02:11:56,408 --> 02:12:01,118
national was a guy from Canada who owns

3416
02:11:59,050 --> 02:12:03,429
Canadian cigarette companies who has got

3417
02:12:01,118 --> 02:12:06,158
a history of drug convictions

3418
02:12:03,429 --> 02:12:08,019
so they got a Canadian guy coming to an

3419
02:12:06,158 --> 02:12:09,848
Indian Reservation who financed a major

3420
02:12:08,019 --> 02:12:11,159
grow he paid for everything and they

3421
02:12:09,849 --> 02:12:13,449
were supposed to grow the cannabis

3422
02:12:11,158 --> 02:12:15,388
distribute this and allegedly get him

3423
02:12:13,448 --> 02:12:19,089
his portion and keep the operation going

3424
02:12:15,389 --> 02:12:20,529
I was amazed that I found the search

3425
02:12:19,090 --> 02:12:22,449
warrants and all of this stuff written

3426
02:12:20,529 --> 02:12:24,128
up if you guys ever get a chance to read

3427
02:12:22,448 --> 02:12:25,418
a technical document like that do it

3428
02:12:24,128 --> 02:12:26,918
just for fun if you're one of those kind

3429
02:12:25,418 --> 02:12:28,628
of people some people are into that [ __ ]

3430
02:12:26,918 --> 02:12:31,300
you'll get a kick out of it it was

3431
02:12:28,628 --> 02:12:32,559
really neat they will not give the

3432
02:12:31,300 --> 02:12:34,208
snitches names they call them

3433
02:12:32,559 --> 02:12:36,219
confidential informants and give a long

3434
02:12:34,208 --> 02:12:38,349
excuse why they keep them confidential

3435
02:12:36,219 --> 02:12:40,208
they talk about how the raid happened

3436
02:12:38,349 --> 02:12:42,279
they talk about so many small details

3437
02:12:40,208 --> 02:12:43,719
you guys will start tripping out and

3438
02:12:42,279 --> 02:12:45,009
wonder if you're being watched when you

3439
02:12:43,719 --> 02:12:46,989
list them if you read a search warrant

3440
02:12:45,010 --> 02:12:48,248
cuz there are so many small details that

3441
02:12:46,988 --> 02:12:49,928
these guys [ __ ] up on they were

3442
02:12:48,248 --> 02:12:51,998
getting their pictures taken they were

3443
02:12:49,929 --> 02:12:53,378
talking to people and all of that [ __ ]

3444
02:12:51,998 --> 02:12:54,519
is in the police reports and in the

3445
02:12:53,378 --> 02:12:56,050
search warrants and you would never

3446
02:12:54,519 --> 02:12:59,679
assume that that shit's being told to

3447
02:12:56,050 --> 02:13:00,579
police but so much of it was yeah all

3448
02:12:59,679 --> 02:13:02,168
right I'm gonna continue with the

3449
02:13:00,578 --> 02:13:04,029
article if I can find out where the hell

3450
02:13:02,168 --> 02:13:05,260
I was alright here we go according to

3451
02:13:04,029 --> 02:13:06,759
Hollywood the investigation of the

3452
02:13:05,260 --> 02:13:08,109
cultivation facility search day

3453
02:13:06,760 --> 02:13:10,059
indicates that both are commercial

3454
02:13:08,109 --> 02:13:11,649
marijuana cultivation projects operated

3455
02:13:10,059 --> 02:13:13,538
with the intent to transport large

3456
02:13:11,649 --> 02:13:15,399
quantities of marijuana off tribal lands

3457
02:13:13,538 --> 02:13:17,800
for distribution at various locations

3458
02:13:15,399 --> 02:13:19,090
yet to be identified by the tribes which

3459
02:13:17,800 --> 02:13:20,800
is a concern to the Department of

3460
02:13:19,090 --> 02:13:22,809
Justice because it goes against their

3461
02:13:20,800 --> 02:13:23,800
guidelines you know why it goes against

3462
02:13:22,809 --> 02:13:25,538
their guidelines because they don't make

3463
02:13:23,800 --> 02:13:28,059
any [ __ ] tax money off of it that's

3464
02:13:25,538 --> 02:13:29,590
part of the problem Horwood said that

3465
02:13:28,059 --> 02:13:30,909
the US Attorney's office consulted with

3466
02:13:29,590 --> 02:13:32,979
members and representatives of both

3467
02:13:30,908 --> 02:13:34,808
tribes which are federally recognized on

3468
02:13:32,979 --> 02:13:37,119
multiple occasions before today's raid

3469
02:13:34,809 --> 02:13:38,439
and reminded the tribes the cultivation

3470
02:13:37,118 --> 02:13:40,748
of marijuana is illegal under federal

3471
02:13:38,439 --> 02:13:42,519
law and that anyone engaging in such

3472
02:13:40,748 --> 02:13:45,069
activity did so at the risk of

3473
02:13:42,519 --> 02:13:46,539
enforcement action she added they were

3474
02:13:45,069 --> 02:13:48,969
also concerned because the large

3475
02:13:46,538 --> 02:13:50,469
quantities violates federal law as

3476
02:13:48,969 --> 02:13:52,210
is not consistent with California's

3477
02:13:50,469 --> 02:13:55,448
compassionate you sacked and undermines

3478
02:13:52,210 --> 02:13:56,979
Oakley enacted marijuana regulations so

3479
02:13:55,448 --> 02:13:59,738
basically you guys these guys got [ __ ]

3480
02:13:56,979 --> 02:14:01,630
because the the tribal laws and the

3481
02:13:59,738 --> 02:14:02,799
locals said you guys are grown too much

3482
02:14:01,630 --> 02:14:04,328
weed you're gonna get in trouble and

3483
02:14:02,800 --> 02:14:05,979
guess what they went ahead and did it

3484
02:14:04,328 --> 02:14:08,189
and guess what they got dealt with by

3485
02:14:05,979 --> 02:14:10,119
the police it's a little bit ridiculous

3486
02:14:08,189 --> 02:14:11,738
don't [ __ ] around you guys if you're

3487
02:14:10,118 --> 02:14:13,658
allowed to grow cannabis if you're a

3488
02:14:11,738 --> 02:14:14,768
native if you're not a native whoever

3489
02:14:13,658 --> 02:14:15,939
you are if you're allowed to grow

3490
02:14:14,769 --> 02:14:18,039
cannabis don't throw it in their face

3491
02:14:15,939 --> 02:14:19,899
and grow too much just follow the rules

3492
02:14:18,038 --> 02:14:22,538
grow what you're allowed to grow and be

3493
02:14:19,899 --> 02:14:23,978
thankful if you're in a non legal state

3494
02:14:22,538 --> 02:14:25,719
do what you got to do I can't encourage

3495
02:14:23,979 --> 02:14:27,670
you either way but if you're in a non

3496
02:14:25,719 --> 02:14:28,748
legal state and you need medicine draw

3497
02:14:27,670 --> 02:14:31,029
what you can't do what you can't be

3498
02:14:28,748 --> 02:14:32,408
careful don't get caught all right in

3499
02:14:31,029 --> 02:14:34,389
the search warrant that I read you guys

3500
02:14:32,408 --> 02:14:35,948
they listed all the strains that these

3501
02:14:34,389 --> 02:14:37,269
guys were working with because they

3502
02:14:35,948 --> 02:14:38,978
pulled the way that a lot of this

3503
02:14:37,269 --> 02:14:40,710
started they pulled over one of their

3504
02:14:38,979 --> 02:14:42,639
transportation vehicles that was

3505
02:14:40,710 --> 02:14:44,710
transporting plants from one grow

3506
02:14:42,639 --> 02:14:47,679
facility to the other and this guy had a

3507
02:14:44,710 --> 02:14:50,019
thousand 1 gallon pots with babies in

3508
02:14:47,679 --> 02:14:52,510
his Ryder truck or his Penske truck and

3509
02:14:50,019 --> 02:14:54,099
they listed off what he had do they had

3510
02:14:52,510 --> 02:14:55,989
blueberry cookies in there they had

3511
02:14:54,099 --> 02:14:58,420
platinum OG in there they had Girl Scout

3512
02:14:55,988 --> 02:15:00,759
cookies these guys had some great cuts

3513
02:14:58,420 --> 02:15:03,519
and I started thinking about it natives

3514
02:15:00,760 --> 02:15:04,719
the natives people we used to call

3515
02:15:03,519 --> 02:15:08,070
Indians when we were kids

3516
02:15:04,719 --> 02:15:10,840
those guys are an agricultural commune

3517
02:15:08,069 --> 02:15:13,090
culture all of their culture is based on

3518
02:15:10,840 --> 02:15:15,670
the earth and agriculture if these

3519
02:15:13,090 --> 02:15:19,090
natives that were growing these cannabis

3520
02:15:15,670 --> 02:15:21,998
plants were the natives that we think of

3521
02:15:19,090 --> 02:15:23,619
when we daydream about Indians those

3522
02:15:21,998 --> 02:15:24,939
guys in my mind would grow amazing

3523
02:15:23,618 --> 02:15:26,978
cannabis and I would love to have gotten

3524
02:15:24,939 --> 02:15:28,538
a sample of the [ __ ] that they drew I'd

3525
02:15:26,979 --> 02:15:30,460
love to see what the natives are drawing

3526
02:15:28,538 --> 02:15:32,078
I bet it's [ __ ] dank just because

3527
02:15:30,460 --> 02:15:33,788
that's what they do their outdoor people

3528
02:15:32,078 --> 02:15:34,929
they're connected with the earth they're

3529
02:15:33,788 --> 02:15:37,238
connected with plants

3530
02:15:34,929 --> 02:15:38,889
I could assume that they grow some dank

3531
02:15:37,238 --> 02:15:41,498
dank weed sounds like they're putting

3532
02:15:38,889 --> 02:15:44,650
out a lot of it too all right what else

3533
02:15:41,498 --> 02:15:46,840
do we have um I think that's all the

3534
02:15:44,649 --> 02:15:48,698
news we're gonna do because we are at 29

3535
02:15:46,840 --> 02:15:50,199
minutes and 50 seconds and my next news

3696
02:23:40,870 --> 02:23:44,950
device I want the Zune h6

3697
02:23:43,540 --> 02:23:46,601
so that I could take the show on the

3698
02:23:44,950 --> 02:23:48,780
road a little bit more my recording gear

3699
02:23:46,601 --> 02:23:51,030
that I have now is kind of bulky

3700
02:23:48,780 --> 02:23:53,070
yes but the device I'm looking at will

3701
02:23:51,030 --> 02:23:54,810
be able to go to any event will be able

3702
02:23:53,069 --> 02:23:55,500
to go anywhere on the fly I'll keep it

3703
02:23:54,809 --> 02:23:57,269
in my backpack

3704
02:23:55,500 --> 02:23:59,489
we'll have podcasts coming from all

3705
02:23:57,270 --> 02:24:01,979
kinds of crazy places those donations

3706
02:23:59,489 --> 02:24:04,500
help a lot that will work out in the

3707
02:24:01,979 --> 02:24:06,059
very near future hopefully if anybody

3708
02:24:04,500 --> 02:24:07,260
out there wants to sponsor the podcast

3709
02:24:06,059 --> 02:24:08,519
just send me an email it's girl from

3710
02:24:07,260 --> 02:24:10,319
your heart at hotmail.com we'll get you

3711
02:24:08,520 --> 02:24:12,960
all the information you need we can get

3712
02:24:10,319 --> 02:24:15,329
your product advertised to a target

3713
02:24:12,959 --> 02:24:17,159
audience of about 5,000 people per week

3714
02:24:15,329 --> 02:24:19,079
plus all the people that go back and

3715
02:24:17,159 --> 02:24:20,430
listen to the catalogued episodes so

3716
02:24:19,079 --> 02:24:23,700
it's really good idea to advertise with

3717
02:24:20,430 --> 02:24:24,930
a cannabis related podcast because I

3718
02:24:23,700 --> 02:24:29,070
think that's all the advertising I've

3719
02:24:24,930 --> 02:24:32,430
got I've got some news articles here the

3720
02:24:29,069 --> 02:24:34,260
current news Mike informed me of today

3721
02:24:32,430 --> 02:24:36,000
was the day that the Colorado Department

3722
02:24:34,260 --> 02:24:40,739
of Public Health and Environment

3723
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:44,100
actually decided to deny PTSD as a

3724
02:24:40,739 --> 02:24:45,899
qualifying condition for medically

3725
02:24:44,100 --> 02:24:48,780
recommended cannabis in the state of

3726
02:24:45,899 --> 02:24:50,760
Colorado if some Colorado there are

3727
02:24:48,780 --> 02:24:53,360
eight qualifying conditions and all

3728
02:24:50,760 --> 02:24:56,969
eight of them were passed by the law

3729
02:24:53,360 --> 02:24:59,400
back in 2000 so the CDP h-he hasn't

3730
02:24:56,969 --> 02:25:00,809
added a single qualifying condition and

3731
02:24:59,399 --> 02:25:03,000
all that time and this is the third time

3732
02:25:00,809 --> 02:25:05,250
they've denied PTSD you know I think

3733
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:08,219
PTSD is definitely a qualifying

3734
02:25:05,250 --> 02:25:09,840
condition it's [ __ ] that they're not

3735
02:25:08,219 --> 02:25:12,389
allowing that it definitely should be

3736
02:25:09,840 --> 02:25:13,710
and how many in our days working the

3737
02:25:12,389 --> 02:25:16,079
counter how many people came in

3738
02:25:13,709 --> 02:25:18,569
specifically saying I'm got PTSD

3739
02:25:16,079 --> 02:25:21,059
marijuana helps so much I love that you

3740
02:25:18,569 --> 02:25:22,500
guys are here absolutely so are we is

3741
02:25:21,059 --> 02:25:24,299
the Colorado Department of Public Health

3742
02:25:22,500 --> 02:25:26,010
and Environment basically giving their

3743
02:25:24,299 --> 02:25:27,840
finger to veterans and telling veterans

3744
02:25:26,010 --> 02:25:29,909
to go drink alcohol instead of consuming

3745
02:25:27,840 --> 02:25:33,329
cannabis to help themselves that's

3746
02:25:29,909 --> 02:25:36,149
basically been effect of their policy

3747
02:25:33,329 --> 02:25:37,829
for the last decade or so so guys what

3748
02:25:36,149 --> 02:25:39,989
they were trying to do is people that

3749
02:25:37,829 --> 02:25:41,819
have PTSD they were trying to get that

3750
02:25:39,989 --> 02:25:43,409
as a qualifying condition to get your

3751
02:25:41,819 --> 02:25:45,000
medical marijuana recommendation from

3752
02:25:43,409 --> 02:25:47,610
the doctor here in the state of Colorado

3753
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:50,549
and it has been denied three times now

3754
02:25:47,610 --> 02:25:54,390
we cannot get post-traumatic stress

3755
02:25:50,549 --> 02:25:56,699
disorder as a condition that is

3756
02:25:54,389 --> 02:25:58,420
qualified that could be treated with

3757
02:25:56,700 --> 02:26:01,029
medical marijuana

3758
02:25:58,420 --> 02:26:02,500
and it's not just best there's a lot of

3759
02:26:01,029 --> 02:26:06,100
people out in the community that have

3760
02:26:02,500 --> 02:26:08,709
pts or PTSD and marijuana helps a lot of

3761
02:26:06,100 --> 02:26:10,390
them and now they can't can sit down and

3762
02:26:08,709 --> 02:26:12,579
talk to their doctor about using

3763
02:26:10,389 --> 02:26:13,719
cannabis directly for that they'd have

3764
02:26:12,579 --> 02:26:15,279
to if they wanted to join the medical

3765
02:26:13,719 --> 02:26:17,829
program have to have one of the other

3766
02:26:15,279 --> 02:26:19,899
eight qualifying conditions or at least

3767
02:26:17,829 --> 02:26:21,430
here they can still visit the rec market

3768
02:26:19,898 --> 02:26:24,099
and just pay a lot more than they would

3769
02:26:21,430 --> 02:26:25,750
in our medical right which doesn't allow

3770
02:26:24,100 --> 02:26:27,279
them to grow the product that they need

3771
02:26:25,750 --> 02:26:28,750
you know that's that's a big part of

3772
02:26:27,279 --> 02:26:30,399
having your medical marijuana card is

3773
02:26:28,750 --> 02:26:32,318
being able to grow or being able to

3774
02:26:30,398 --> 02:26:34,719
assign a caregiver to grow for you

3775
02:26:32,318 --> 02:26:37,269
that's a big part of it right trying to

3776
02:26:34,719 --> 02:26:39,219
do three plants in your backyard or if

3777
02:26:37,270 --> 02:26:42,040
that's allowed in your area and whatnot

3778
02:26:39,219 --> 02:26:44,170
just brutal difficult already if you're

3779
02:26:42,040 --> 02:26:49,060
already suffering PTSD like now you've

3780
02:26:44,170 --> 02:26:51,670
got to protect yourself from you know I

3781
02:26:49,059 --> 02:26:53,799
think a large portion of the population

3782
02:26:51,670 --> 02:26:54,850
has some form of post-traumatic stress

3783
02:26:53,799 --> 02:26:56,948
disorder

3784
02:26:54,850 --> 02:26:58,779
whether it be childhood trauma anything

3785
02:26:56,949 --> 02:26:59,739
you can see something very little when

3786
02:26:58,779 --> 02:27:01,720
you're a child and that you're a

3787
02:26:59,738 --> 02:27:03,488
psychology kid a psychology student

3788
02:27:01,719 --> 02:27:04,809
something really little and your kid can

3789
02:27:03,488 --> 02:27:07,209
really [ __ ] you up permanently if you

3790
02:27:04,809 --> 02:27:09,549
don't take it right there was a study

3791
02:27:07,209 --> 02:27:11,889
looking at kids and some of the rougher

3792
02:27:09,549 --> 02:27:14,170
parts of Chicago and it was like 80% of

3793
02:27:11,889 --> 02:27:16,988
the kids exhibited some symptoms of PTSD

3794
02:27:14,170 --> 02:27:19,329
and a lot of people started calling it

3795
02:27:16,988 --> 02:27:20,648
just they've dropped the D and so it's

3796
02:27:19,329 --> 02:27:22,898
no longer disorder it's just

3797
02:27:20,648 --> 02:27:26,379
post-traumatic stress it's what the

3798
02:27:22,898 --> 02:27:28,209
human body and brain does after a

3799
02:27:26,379 --> 02:27:31,179
seriously traumatic incident sometimes

3800
02:27:28,209 --> 02:27:34,209
in a lot of people coming home from war

3801
02:27:31,180 --> 02:27:36,449
or that has witnessed domestic violence

3802
02:27:34,209 --> 02:27:38,948
or been victim domestic violence or

3803
02:27:36,449 --> 02:27:40,510
crashes somebody I've seen somebody died

3804
02:27:38,949 --> 02:27:41,890
in a car crash and it's in the back of

3805
02:27:40,510 --> 02:27:43,960
my mind every time we're on the highway

3806
02:27:41,889 --> 02:27:45,459
I always get a little flashback of that

3807
02:27:43,959 --> 02:27:47,289
and I don't like u-turns for the same

3808
02:27:45,459 --> 02:27:50,019
reason yeah you've told me that amazing

3809
02:27:47,290 --> 02:27:52,659
story there yeah so what I was headed

3810
02:27:50,020 --> 02:27:54,640
for is I was gonna imply that I don't

3811
02:27:52,658 --> 02:27:56,590
know what event it is but I know there's

3812
02:27:54,639 --> 02:27:58,930
some sort of post-traumatic stress in my

3813
02:27:56,590 --> 02:28:00,340
mind from my life and that's why I said

3814
02:27:58,930 --> 02:28:02,859
everybody's probably got excited have a

3815
02:28:00,340 --> 02:28:04,840
significant event that I can recall but

3816
02:28:02,859 --> 02:28:07,809
I've seen some [ __ ] and I know that when

3817
02:28:04,840 --> 02:28:10,120
I feel even if you've got stress of the

3818
02:28:07,809 --> 02:28:11,799
day when you smoke it distracts you and

3819
02:28:10,120 --> 02:28:12,310
it calms that part of your brain down

3820
02:28:11,799 --> 02:28:15,398
and it'll

3821
02:28:12,309 --> 02:28:16,568
you do not obsess on that thought

3822
02:28:15,398 --> 02:28:19,059
now let's you kind of break free of that

3823
02:28:16,568 --> 02:28:20,618
a little bit the big thing a lot of the

3824
02:28:19,059 --> 02:28:23,228
people that I know that we're treating

3825
02:28:20,619 --> 02:28:25,869
their PTSD with cannabis would talk

3826
02:28:23,228 --> 02:28:28,299
about is the dreamless sleep that was

3827
02:28:25,869 --> 02:28:29,739
the big benefit that they talk about at

3828
02:28:28,299 --> 02:28:32,049
least when they were in the shop so it

3829
02:28:29,738 --> 02:28:34,809
would stop their dreams yep

3830
02:28:32,049 --> 02:28:36,340
I mean I haven't I barely dream and I

3831
02:28:34,809 --> 02:28:38,350
attribute that to cannabis use because

3832
02:28:36,340 --> 02:28:41,670
when I don't smoke I have very vivid

3833
02:28:38,350 --> 02:28:43,658
dreams just regularly that's odd because

3834
02:28:41,670 --> 02:28:45,250
people have asked me what I like to

3835
02:28:43,658 --> 02:28:47,799
smoke and I say I like to smoke a heavy

3836
02:28:45,250 --> 02:28:49,750
heavy sativa right before bed because it

3837
02:28:47,799 --> 02:28:51,789
makes my mind do that laundry thing and

3838
02:28:49,750 --> 02:28:53,318
so I close my eyes and I feel like I

3839
02:28:51,790 --> 02:28:58,720
just dream instantly because I'm already

3840
02:28:53,318 --> 02:29:00,670
right there I just close my eyes and

3841
02:28:58,719 --> 02:29:02,170
then my dreams are claymation and they

3842
02:29:00,670 --> 02:29:03,850
just happen as soon as my eyes closed

3843
02:29:02,170 --> 02:29:06,850
and then I sleep really well on a heavy

3844
02:29:03,850 --> 02:29:08,109
sativa and I have huge dreams from it so

3845
02:29:06,850 --> 02:29:09,670
that's kind of strange that it stops

3846
02:29:08,109 --> 02:29:10,779
other people's dreams which I'm not

3847
02:29:09,670 --> 02:29:14,559
gonna argue that if it's working for

3848
02:29:10,779 --> 02:29:16,119
them that's amazing do you like you

3849
02:29:14,559 --> 02:29:18,010
still dream bro and you looked at me

3850
02:29:16,119 --> 02:29:20,470
like offended like of course why would

3851
02:29:18,010 --> 02:29:22,600
not have an amazing dream yeah I just

3852
02:29:20,469 --> 02:29:24,879
assumed that that the effect was

3853
02:29:22,600 --> 02:29:26,949
something you got to cuz you consume way

3854
02:29:24,879 --> 02:29:28,809
more than me sometimes I can control my

3855
02:29:26,949 --> 02:29:31,029
dreams a little bit but if I get too

3856
02:29:28,809 --> 02:29:33,010
carried away I wake myself up but so I

3857
02:29:31,029 --> 02:29:34,720
know I'm like don't influence this dream

3858
02:29:33,010 --> 02:29:36,939
too much but also kind of guide it a

3859
02:29:34,719 --> 02:29:40,828
little like but if I if I push too hard

3860
02:29:36,939 --> 02:29:40,828
I wake myself up out of the dream no I

3861
02:29:41,189 --> 02:29:47,470
constantly I wake up or something like

3862
02:29:45,398 --> 02:29:50,049
that out of a dream right yeah it's

3863
02:29:47,469 --> 02:29:52,209
funny alright so if you guys are working

3864
02:29:50,049 --> 02:29:54,849
on getting medical marijuana in your

3865
02:29:52,209 --> 02:29:56,139
area in your state please while you're

3866
02:29:54,850 --> 02:29:58,270
writing the bills while you're writing

3867
02:29:56,139 --> 02:29:59,709
the rules please put in some sort of a

3868
02:29:58,270 --> 02:30:01,869
clause that includes post-traumatic

3869
02:29:59,709 --> 02:30:03,398
stress disorder it's not something that

3870
02:30:01,869 --> 02:30:05,500
you can see but it is something that

3871
02:30:03,398 --> 02:30:07,209
definitely exists we need it for our

3872
02:30:05,500 --> 02:30:09,520
veterans more than anything but it's

3873
02:30:07,209 --> 02:30:11,889
also for everybody let's be fair out

3874
02:30:09,520 --> 02:30:13,658
there you guys yep not all medical

3875
02:30:11,889 --> 02:30:15,340
conditions are visible that's something

3876
02:30:13,658 --> 02:30:17,709
you gotta keep in mind right the bill

3877
02:30:15,340 --> 02:30:20,020
well we uh we here in Colorado all

3878
02:30:17,709 --> 02:30:20,759
assume that the CD Phe would be willing

3879
02:30:20,020 --> 02:30:22,620
to add

3880
02:30:20,760 --> 02:30:25,109
conditions to the list of currently

3881
02:30:22,620 --> 02:30:27,359
accepted conditions over time but

3882
02:30:25,109 --> 02:30:29,040
there's been countless applications at

3883
02:30:27,359 --> 02:30:32,399
this point I can't remember how many but

3884
02:30:29,040 --> 02:30:33,750
it's like 15 or 20 Wow PTSD has been up

3885
02:30:32,398 --> 02:30:36,358
three times and they've denied

3886
02:30:33,750 --> 02:30:37,799
everything just flat out nope not at

3887
02:30:36,359 --> 02:30:40,229
this time there's not enough research

3888
02:30:37,799 --> 02:30:42,509
showing that there is you know a general

3889
02:30:40,228 --> 02:30:44,309
effect and there isn't research done

3890
02:30:42,510 --> 02:30:47,370
because it's not allowed yet not enough

3891
02:30:44,309 --> 02:30:49,709
research that harm you can't do your

3892
02:30:47,370 --> 02:30:52,260
research until very very like within the

3893
02:30:49,709 --> 02:30:54,959
last few months recently so these

3894
02:30:52,260 --> 02:30:57,450
studies are being drawn up now that will

3895
02:30:54,959 --> 02:31:00,239
be conducted in the next year or seven

3896
02:30:57,450 --> 02:31:02,430
the you know findings will be out and

3897
02:31:00,239 --> 02:31:05,039
become public knowledge ten years from

3898
02:31:02,430 --> 02:31:07,020
then like and we're just gonna keep

3899
02:31:05,040 --> 02:31:09,090
letting people suffer or I mean at least

3900
02:31:07,020 --> 02:31:11,550
in Colorado they can use the rec market

3901
02:31:09,090 --> 02:31:13,409
or right I mean it's not like the

3902
02:31:11,549 --> 02:31:14,879
black-market ever wonder what way here

3903
02:31:13,409 --> 02:31:17,450
it has had to step up its game

3904
02:31:14,879 --> 02:31:21,478
considerably to continue to compete but

3905
02:31:17,450 --> 02:31:23,939
the options and then once the vet has

3906
02:31:21,478 --> 02:31:33,568
the bud here in Colorado it's legal

3907
02:31:23,939 --> 02:31:35,550
again alright today we stumbled over our

3908
02:31:33,568 --> 02:31:37,199
own dicks once again so make sure you

3909
02:31:35,549 --> 02:31:38,608
guys include the PTSD when you write

3910
02:31:37,200 --> 02:31:41,700
your new medical marijuana bill that's

3911
02:31:38,609 --> 02:31:42,809
my main point here and the next time it

3912
02:31:41,700 --> 02:31:44,069
comes up that we're trying to vote on

3913
02:31:42,809 --> 02:31:45,930
this make sure you support it because I

3914
02:31:44,068 --> 02:31:47,519
fully think that PTSD is a qualifying

3915
02:31:45,930 --> 02:31:49,380
condition you get registered to vote

3916
02:31:47,520 --> 02:31:52,590
marijuana will be on your ballot in the

3917
02:31:49,379 --> 02:31:54,898
next two years yes it will yes if it's

3918
02:31:52,590 --> 02:31:58,859
not on the ballot in 2015 vote anyway

3919
02:31:54,898 --> 02:32:01,170
and just practice that [ __ ] for 2016

3920
02:31:58,859 --> 02:32:04,350
because it will then so we talked a

3921
02:32:01,170 --> 02:32:08,090
little bit in the last episode about the

3922
02:32:04,350 --> 02:32:10,770
desire for Denver voters to want

3923
02:32:08,090 --> 02:32:12,239
consumption in some establishments where

3924
02:32:10,770 --> 02:32:16,649
people are over 21 and they're not

3925
02:32:12,239 --> 02:32:19,379
smoking inside on where's the date okay

3926
02:32:16,648 --> 02:32:21,239
it was July 9th the cannabis posted an

3927
02:32:19,379 --> 02:32:22,978
update to that article and it says

3928
02:32:21,239 --> 02:32:25,859
Denver voters favor

3929
02:32:22,978 --> 02:32:27,869
limited pot use in bars it says Denver

3930
02:32:25,859 --> 02:32:29,030
Marijuana Paul a majority of voters in

3931
02:32:27,870 --> 02:32:31,040
the city

3932
02:32:29,030 --> 02:32:35,090
initiative that would allow limited pot

3933
02:32:31,040 --> 02:32:38,660
use no indoor smoking at businesses over

3934
02:32:35,090 --> 02:32:40,340
21 businesses such as bars it's been

3935
02:32:38,659 --> 02:32:42,409
voted on this article was written by

3936
02:32:40,340 --> 02:32:44,030
Ricardo Baca from the cannabis staff I

3937
02:32:42,409 --> 02:32:45,799
may skip part of it because we just need

3938
02:32:44,030 --> 02:32:47,989
to get to the point here but it says a

3939
02:32:45,799 --> 02:32:49,549
majority of Denver voters support an

3940
02:32:47,989 --> 02:32:51,021
initiative that would allow limited

3941
02:32:49,549 --> 02:32:52,640
social marijuana consumption in

3942
02:32:51,021 --> 02:32:54,320
businesses such as bars according to a

3943
02:32:52,640 --> 02:32:56,090
poll commissioned by the group behind

3944
02:32:54,319 --> 02:32:57,681
the proposal the cannabis has learned

3945
02:32:56,090 --> 02:33:00,710
exclusively I kind of read that weird

3946
02:32:57,681 --> 02:33:03,790
but I think the people that wrote up the

3947
02:33:00,709 --> 02:33:07,579
bill paid for a poll and the poll says

3948
02:33:03,790 --> 02:33:10,820
support it so fingers crossed I mean

3949
02:33:07,579 --> 02:33:14,030
their poll doesn't if you're really into

3950
02:33:10,819 --> 02:33:16,459
politics their poll says that voters

3951
02:33:14,030 --> 02:33:17,630
supported by 56% if they add in the

3952
02:33:16,459 --> 02:33:32,510
people that are totally not gonna

3953
02:33:17,629 --> 02:33:34,670
[ __ ] vote I don't I hope it passes in

3954
02:33:32,511 --> 02:33:37,250
2015 the need for this is huge it's huge

3955
02:33:34,670 --> 02:33:39,351
but the poll data does not look

3956
02:33:37,250 --> 02:33:42,049
favorable right now if more of us don't

3957
02:33:39,351 --> 02:33:43,940
get politically active true actually

3958
02:33:42,049 --> 02:33:46,609
says the poll results say only 56

3959
02:33:43,940 --> 02:33:49,460
percent of likely Denver voters either

3960
02:33:46,610 --> 02:33:51,110
strongly support or somewhat support the

3961
02:33:49,459 --> 02:33:55,459
initiative according to the democratic

3962
02:33:51,110 --> 02:33:57,800
firm Public Policy Polling so 56% isn't

3963
02:33:55,459 --> 02:33:59,869
a bold number that's nope that's six

3964
02:33:57,799 --> 02:34:01,159
percent away from losing and when you

3965
02:33:59,870 --> 02:34:03,351
really look at the polling data is

3966
02:34:01,159 --> 02:34:06,261
something like thirty percent are like

3967
02:34:03,351 --> 02:34:07,101
gung-ho about it in twenty six percent

3968
02:34:06,261 --> 02:34:10,220
don't give a [ __ ]

3969
02:34:07,101 --> 02:34:12,170
it says you're against the initiative

3970
02:34:10,220 --> 02:34:14,029
thirty one percent strongly opposed and

3971
02:34:12,170 --> 02:34:15,530
nine percent somewhat opposed it while

3972
02:34:14,030 --> 02:34:18,141
five percent said they weren't sure

3973
02:34:15,530 --> 02:34:20,300
right it was an automated telephone poll

3974
02:34:18,140 --> 02:34:22,549
and it's got a margin of error of three

3975
02:34:20,299 --> 02:34:23,989
point nine percentage points so this is

3976
02:34:22,549 --> 02:34:25,459
just a telephone poll people on the

3977
02:34:23,989 --> 02:34:26,780
telephone will say that they will do

3978
02:34:25,459 --> 02:34:28,430
anything cuz all you gotta do is sit

3979
02:34:26,780 --> 02:34:30,920
there and press one for yes and two for

3980
02:34:28,431 --> 02:34:32,360
no and three for English right that's

3981
02:34:30,920 --> 02:34:34,489
all they had to worry about so yeah a

3982
02:34:32,360 --> 02:34:35,540
lot of these people probably won't come

3983
02:34:34,489 --> 02:34:37,159
out and vote

3984
02:34:35,540 --> 02:34:38,690
so the pollsters asked whether voters

3985
02:34:37,159 --> 02:34:40,369
would support allowing the consumption

3986
02:34:38,690 --> 02:34:41,829
of marijuana at private venues in Denver

3987
02:34:40,370 --> 02:34:43,990
provided that the owner of the venue

3988
02:34:41,829 --> 02:34:45,909
permits the consumption access to the

3989
02:34:43,989 --> 02:34:47,770
venue is limited to individuals 21 years

3990
02:34:45,909 --> 02:34:49,898
of age of older and smoking marijuana

3991
02:34:47,770 --> 02:34:53,979
indoors is prohibited and any outdoor

3992
02:34:49,898 --> 02:34:55,809
uses hidden from public view that's all

3993
02:34:53,978 --> 02:34:58,090
fair that makes sense it's really not

3994
02:34:55,809 --> 02:35:02,889
that but it's that of a bill and it's

3995
02:34:58,090 --> 02:35:06,430
fairly sorry guys dabs and soda yep it's

3996
02:35:02,889 --> 02:35:08,709
a pretty fair bill you gotta be outside

3997
02:35:06,430 --> 02:35:13,350
and it's gotta be 25 feet from wherever

3998
02:35:08,709 --> 02:35:16,719
public gather roofdeck

3999
02:35:13,350 --> 02:35:18,550
type establishments in Denver where they

4000
02:35:16,719 --> 02:35:20,199
just there's a couple of bars that we're

4001
02:35:18,549 --> 02:35:22,059
already doing this and if you felt like

4002
02:35:20,200 --> 02:35:26,649
being outside you couldn't smoke up

4003
02:35:22,059 --> 02:35:28,629
there tobacco or usually the last time I

4004
02:35:26,648 --> 02:35:31,299
was up there but now they're gonna allow

4005
02:35:28,629 --> 02:35:33,009
marijuana up there or at least 25 feet

4006
02:35:31,299 --> 02:35:35,039
away from the public so I can a mobile

4007
02:35:33,010 --> 02:35:37,989
back courtyard that's all fenced off

4008
02:35:35,040 --> 02:35:39,970
like servantes servantes other side in

4009
02:35:37,989 --> 02:35:51,250
Denver has got the perfect little area

4010
02:35:39,969 --> 02:35:53,438
for smoking yeah so just let us do it

4011
02:35:51,250 --> 02:35:54,760
they said they're gathering 5,000

4012
02:35:53,439 --> 02:35:57,100
signatures to get the question on

4013
02:35:54,760 --> 02:35:58,809
Denver's November ballot another one of

4014
02:35:57,100 --> 02:36:00,909
the poll findings that Denver residents

4015
02:35:58,809 --> 02:36:02,739
by a 4 to 1 ratio believe that alcohol

4016
02:36:00,909 --> 02:36:05,020
causes more problems in the city than

4017
02:36:02,739 --> 02:36:07,780
marijuana it also favors their side of

4018
02:36:05,020 --> 02:36:09,040
the contentious issue Denver voters have

4019
02:36:07,780 --> 02:36:10,600
made it quite clear that they support

4020
02:36:09,040 --> 02:36:12,700
treating marijuana like alcohol said

4021
02:36:10,600 --> 02:36:14,530
MASINT divert a national park activists

4022
02:36:12,700 --> 02:36:16,960
and one of the primary authors behind

4023
02:36:14,530 --> 02:36:19,479
Colorado's original cannabis legalizing

4024
02:36:16,959 --> 02:36:22,209
amendment 64 Isis voters approved

4025
02:36:19,478 --> 02:36:25,510
measures to measures to the effect in

4026
02:36:22,209 --> 02:36:28,688
2001 measures to the effect of 2005 2006

4027
02:36:25,510 --> 02:36:30,550
2007 and 2012 and so it's not surprising

4028
02:36:28,689 --> 02:36:32,950
that we're still seeing such strong

4029
02:36:30,549 --> 02:36:34,929
support even among a more conservative

4030
02:36:32,950 --> 02:36:37,270
voting population in an off-year

4031
02:36:34,930 --> 02:36:38,800
election so people are supporting it

4032
02:36:37,270 --> 02:36:41,229
more surprisingly than we had

4033
02:36:38,799 --> 02:36:42,909
anticipated even a poll this goods a

4034
02:36:41,228 --> 02:36:43,689
little surprising the people who follow

4035
02:36:42,909 --> 02:36:45,729
this

4036
02:36:43,690 --> 02:36:47,380
so I I mean I wish them the best of luck

4037
02:36:45,729 --> 02:36:49,869
if I lived in Denver they'd have my vote

4038
02:36:47,379 --> 02:36:51,520
it says in the question that asked

4039
02:36:49,870 --> 02:36:54,400
respondents if alcohol or marijuana

4040
02:36:51,521 --> 02:36:58,300
cause more problems in Denver 55% said

4041
02:36:54,399 --> 02:37:02,049
alcohol 13% said marijuana 26% said both

4042
02:36:58,299 --> 02:37:04,359
and 6% were not sure so we're making it

4043
02:37:02,049 --> 02:37:05,949
obvious here that alcohol is the problem

4044
02:37:04,360 --> 02:37:07,510
in cannabis is the peaceful way to

4045
02:37:05,950 --> 02:37:10,210
gather and celebrate and have a good

4046
02:37:07,510 --> 02:37:13,750
time and relax the last paragraph of the

4047
02:37:10,209 --> 02:37:15,549
article says by more than four to one

4048
02:37:13,750 --> 02:37:17,021
margin in Denver voters cite alcohol

4049
02:37:15,549 --> 02:37:18,879
over marijuana as a bigger source of

4050
02:37:17,021 --> 02:37:20,771
problems in the city said divert anyone

4051
02:37:18,879 --> 02:37:22,839
who has spent time in the loto on a

4052
02:37:20,771 --> 02:37:24,460
weekend evening or walk down Colfax

4053
02:37:22,840 --> 02:37:26,680
Avenue on any given day knows that

4054
02:37:24,459 --> 02:37:28,750
alcohol contributes to far more problems

4055
02:37:26,680 --> 02:37:31,510
and far more severe problems than

4056
02:37:28,750 --> 02:37:34,090
marijuana he said which if you go out on

4057
02:37:31,510 --> 02:37:36,819
almost any major city any big city on

4058
02:37:34,090 --> 02:37:38,530
the weekends you if you go to the bar

4059
02:37:36,819 --> 02:37:40,390
where is that every downtown's got that

4060
02:37:38,530 --> 02:37:42,851
one area there's a nice congregation of

4061
02:37:40,390 --> 02:37:44,920
bars and everybody goes there and about

4062
02:37:42,851 --> 02:37:47,739
1 o'clock on Friday night out of one of

4063
02:37:44,920 --> 02:37:49,989
the bars erupts a big ass fight after

4064
02:37:47,739 --> 02:37:51,340
the bar spills out and they all push the

4065
02:37:49,989 --> 02:37:52,959
[ __ ] out of each other and then the cops

4066
02:37:51,340 --> 02:37:55,030
come and a few people get arrested and

4067
02:37:52,959 --> 02:37:57,039
then you hear about it's Saturday um

4068
02:37:55,030 --> 02:37:59,440
that doesn't happen in weed events and

4069
02:37:57,040 --> 02:38:00,670
if it does we we shun those people from

4070
02:37:59,440 --> 02:38:05,079
the community and they don't come back

4071
02:38:00,670 --> 02:38:08,549
right is a peaceful drug like alcohol is

4072
02:38:05,079 --> 02:38:11,590
the problem for sure so I think if they

4073
02:38:08,549 --> 02:38:13,239
smoke at clubs and stuff I would go I

4074
02:38:11,590 --> 02:38:14,771
don't go to places because I don't drink

4075
02:38:13,239 --> 02:38:16,180
alcohol there's no reason for me to be

4076
02:38:14,771 --> 02:38:18,940
there but if I can go take a few dad's

4077
02:38:16,180 --> 02:38:20,890
I'd be more likely to go to the shows at

4078
02:38:18,940 --> 02:38:22,720
the local venues because even though

4079
02:38:20,890 --> 02:38:24,459
it's not my kind of music I would go be

4080
02:38:22,719 --> 02:38:25,899
social if I could go dab out and have

4081
02:38:24,459 --> 02:38:27,789
fun there right we're not antisocial

4082
02:38:25,899 --> 02:38:30,159
we're just if explaining that we don't

4083
02:38:27,790 --> 02:38:31,630
drink yeah I don't I do not want a beer

4084
02:38:30,159 --> 02:38:33,010
but thank you and no it's not because

4085
02:38:31,629 --> 02:38:34,929
I'm better than you it's because I don't

4086
02:38:33,010 --> 02:38:38,021

alright we're 20 minutes in we're gonna

4128
02:40:46,170 --> 02:40:50,250
make this a little bit of a longer

4129
02:40:47,309 --> 02:40:51,659
episode the article says this is also

4130
02:40:50,250 --> 02:40:54,120
from the cannabis stand it was written

4131
02:40:51,659 --> 02:40:57,329
by Jean Johnson of The Associated Press

4132
02:40:54,120 --> 02:40:59,220
the headline is one year in seventy

4133
02:40:57,329 --> 02:41:01,379
million dollars in pot taxes and other

4134
02:40:59,219 --> 02:41:03,510
lessons from Washington on the

4135
02:41:01,379 --> 02:41:04,949
sub-headline we get a headline and a sub

4136
02:41:03,510 --> 02:41:07,079
headline now in articles that's great

4137
02:41:04,950 --> 02:41:07,771
the internet is [ __ ] up our heads was

4138
02:41:07,079 --> 02:41:09,931
250

4139
02:41:07,771 --> 02:41:11,641
million in marijuana sales Washington

4140
02:41:09,931 --> 02:41:13,921
still has room to grow as its ninth

4141
02:41:11,640 --> 02:41:15,569
largest grower says it's amazing we

4142
02:41:13,921 --> 02:41:19,681
could be so successful and unsuccessful

4143
02:41:15,569 --> 02:41:22,020
at the same time to say Washington

4144
02:41:19,681 --> 02:41:23,579
launched its second in the nation legal

4145
02:41:22,021 --> 02:41:25,320
marijuana market with just a handful of

4146
02:41:23,579 --> 02:41:27,421
stores selling high-priced pot to long

4147
02:41:25,319 --> 02:41:30,569
lines of customers a year later the

4148
02:41:27,421 --> 02:41:32,579
state has about 160 shops open pot tax

4149
02:41:30,569 --> 02:41:35,970
revenues have soared past expectations

4150
02:41:32,579 --> 02:41:39,511
and sales top 1.4 million dollars per

4151
02:41:35,970 --> 02:41:41,399
day they're making 1.4 million dollars

4152
02:41:39,511 --> 02:41:44,370
per day on cannabis in Washington right

4153
02:41:41,399 --> 02:41:45,841
now it also goes on to say and who knows

4154
02:41:44,370 --> 02:41:48,030
the industry might even start making

4155
02:41:45,841 --> 02:41:50,069
some money Washington pot farmers

4156
02:41:48,030 --> 02:41:51,989
processors and retailers have complained

4157
02:41:50,069 --> 02:41:53,579
all years a heavy state and federal tax

4158
02:41:51,989 --> 02:41:55,199
burdens along with competition from an

4159
02:41:53,579 --> 02:41:56,761
unregulated medical marijuana market

4160
02:41:55,200 --> 02:41:59,490
have made it difficult for them to do

4161
02:41:56,761 --> 02:42:02,190
business but at least some relief is

4162
02:41:59,489 --> 02:42:04,261
there as here this month two new laws

4163
02:42:02,190 --> 02:42:05,851
take effect wonder regulate and tax

4164
02:42:04,261 --> 02:42:08,131
medical marijuana and one to cut

4165
02:42:05,851 --> 02:42:14,461
Washington's three-level excise pot tax

4166
02:42:08,130 --> 02:42:16,319
to a single 37 percent tax that's the

4167
02:42:14,460 --> 02:42:21,170
big lesson between Washington and

4168
02:42:16,319 --> 02:42:23,880
Colorado is that the free market applies

4169
02:42:21,171 --> 02:42:26,489
in Colorado there are a lot of people

4170
02:42:23,880 --> 02:42:29,159
that are that have been smoking

4171
02:42:26,489 --> 02:42:31,171
marijuana here for 4050 years and the

4172
02:42:29,159 --> 02:42:34,819
only time they visit the stores is for

4173
02:42:31,171 --> 02:42:37,050
novelty write the occasional selection

4174
02:42:34,819 --> 02:42:38,789
for the most part they're still buying

4175
02:42:37,050 --> 02:42:43,140
marijuana where they used to because

4176
02:42:38,790 --> 02:42:45,961
it's half the price yes in Washington

4177
02:42:43,140 --> 02:42:48,359
the taxes are so bad that almost none of

4178
02:42:45,960 --> 02:42:52,439
the locals are interested because

4179
02:42:48,360 --> 02:42:55,051
they're taxing like 75% it's like 25

4180
02:42:52,440 --> 02:42:56,521
percent three different times and so by

4181
02:42:55,050 --> 02:42:59,039
the time it gets to the consumer at

4182
02:42:56,521 --> 02:43:00,900
grams like 60 bucks in what the [ __ ]

4183
02:42:59,040 --> 02:43:02,280
yeah who's gonna pay that when you can

4184
02:43:00,899 --> 02:43:05,699
just go to the dude on the corner and

4185
02:43:02,280 --> 02:43:07,501
get it for 12 or 15 right yeah okay

4186
02:43:05,700 --> 02:43:09,030
article goes on to say despite some

4187
02:43:07,501 --> 02:43:12,010
industry gripes and those tweaks to

4188
02:43:09,030 --> 02:43:14,950
Washington's legal pot law marijuana

4189
02:43:12,010 --> 02:43:16,690
which marijuana law which voters passed

4190
02:43:14,950 --> 02:43:19,000
in 2012 to legalize marijuana for adults

4191
02:43:16,690 --> 02:43:20,440
over 21 officials and legalization

4192
02:43:19,000 --> 02:43:21,640
backers say the state's slow and

4193
02:43:20,440 --> 02:43:23,351
deliberate effort to regulate marijuana

4194
02:43:21,640 --> 02:43:25,539
has been a success

4195
02:43:23,351 --> 02:43:28,360
a year after stores opened on July 8th

4196
02:43:25,540 --> 02:43:31,420
2014 here's a look at the state of legal

4197
02:43:28,360 --> 02:43:33,220
weed here it says the taxes Washington

4198
02:43:31,420 --> 02:43:34,750
racked up more than 250 million dollars

4199
02:43:33,219 --> 02:43:37,060
in marijuana sales in the past year

4200
02:43:34,750 --> 02:43:39,940
roughly 62 million dollars of which

4201
02:43:37,060 --> 02:43:41,739
constitute marijuana excise taxes that's

4202
02:43:39,940 --> 02:43:44,079
beyond the state's original forecast of

4203
02:43:41,739 --> 02:43:46,420
36 million and when the state and local

4204
02:43:44,079 --> 02:43:48,399
sales and other shops other taxes are

4205
02:43:46,420 --> 02:43:50,771
included the total pay day for the state

4206
02:43:48,399 --> 02:43:54,969
and local government tops 70 million

4207
02:43:50,771 --> 02:43:57,190
dollars ok so the interesting number

4208
02:43:54,969 --> 02:44:00,549
there is the 60 million excise tax in

4209
02:43:57,190 --> 02:44:02,620
Colorado the excise tax is what's

4210
02:44:00,549 --> 02:44:05,949
supposed to pay that 40 million dollars

4211
02:44:02,620 --> 02:44:07,630
for schools and we've already crushed in

4212
02:44:05,950 --> 02:44:10,391
the first five months of this year last

4213
02:44:07,629 --> 02:44:12,579
year's whole year total nice because the

4214
02:44:10,390 --> 02:44:15,100
standalone production markets only just

4215
02:44:12,579 --> 02:44:16,870
now coming online yeah all the shops had

4216
02:44:15,101 --> 02:44:18,870
to produce their own for the longest

4217
02:44:16,870 --> 02:44:21,220
time here and so that was the

4218
02:44:18,870 --> 02:44:24,311
infrastructure we started with and

4219
02:44:21,219 --> 02:44:26,859
because of that that excise tax was real

4220
02:44:24,310 --> 02:44:28,840
small here in Colorado and that's the

4221
02:44:26,860 --> 02:44:31,450
huge difference between our taxes in

4222
02:44:28,840 --> 02:44:34,060
their taxes is by the time it gets to

4223
02:44:31,450 --> 02:44:36,370
the Shelf that excise taxes nuts yes

4224
02:44:34,060 --> 02:44:40,629
only 10 million of theirs was in sales

4225
02:44:36,370 --> 02:44:44,290
tax we collected like 6040 or something

4226
02:44:40,629 --> 02:44:50,500
like that and just sales tax I hope when

4227
02:44:44,290 --> 02:44:52,931
the taxes are done away with or adjusted

4228
02:44:50,500 --> 02:44:55,810
somehow it's gonna have to come back

4229
02:44:52,931 --> 02:44:57,220
down to reality or they won't matter so

4230
02:44:55,810 --> 02:45:01,209
much because they're charging you thirty

4231
02:44:57,219 --> 02:45:05,529
six percent tax on a $2.00 gram which is

4232
02:45:01,209 --> 02:45:06,819
entirely feasible which from their me

4233
02:45:05,530 --> 02:45:09,190
they're growing a lot of cannabis right

4234
02:45:06,819 --> 02:45:11,199
now and in Washington they may grow more

4235
02:45:09,190 --> 02:45:13,989
than they're able to sell is something

4236
02:45:11,200 --> 02:45:15,641
that I see possibly happening so that

4237
02:45:13,989 --> 02:45:18,189
really could happen it could go really

4238
02:45:15,640 --> 02:45:19,420
dirty cheap pretty soon here

4239
02:45:18,189 --> 02:45:21,100
I don't see how long we've been

4240
02:45:19,420 --> 02:45:22,328
recording and we might yeah we're gonna

4241
02:45:21,100 --> 02:45:24,939
read the rest of this article and we're

4242
02:45:22,328 --> 02:45:26,859
gonna save the I got one more article

4243
02:45:24,939 --> 02:45:28,479
we'll get into so the next sub headline

4244
02:45:26,859 --> 02:45:30,248
and this article says isn't legal weed

4245
02:45:28,478 --> 02:45:33,068
expensive in Washington and it goes on

4246
02:45:30,248 --> 02:45:35,619
to say a few growers harvesting by the

4247
02:45:33,068 --> 02:45:36,998
first time sorry let me read it again

4248
02:45:35,619 --> 02:45:38,828
because it's moving there we go with the

4249
02:45:36,998 --> 02:45:40,299
few growers harvesting by the time the

4250
02:45:38,828 --> 02:45:41,680
first store just opened the average

4251
02:45:40,299 --> 02:45:44,469
price of a gram of legal marijuana

4252
02:45:41,680 --> 02:45:46,568
sparked spikes to nearly $30 last summer

4253
02:45:44,469 --> 02:45:48,429
about three times the cost in medical

4254
02:45:46,568 --> 02:45:50,228
marijuana shops but prices have been

4255
02:45:48,430 --> 02:45:53,648
dropping as more weed gets harvested in

4256
02:45:50,228 --> 02:45:55,629
fact Washington has harvested 13.5 tons

4257
02:45:53,648 --> 02:45:58,028
of marijuana flower intended to be sold

4258
02:45:55,629 --> 02:46:00,728
as bud but stores have only sold about

4259
02:45:58,029 --> 02:46:02,979
10 tons some of the excess can be turned

4260
02:46:00,728 --> 02:46:04,629
into marijuana extracts such as oil but

4261
02:46:02,978 --> 02:46:07,599
the harvest has helped drive down the

4262
02:46:04,629 --> 02:46:09,188
prices to an average of about 1150 per

4263
02:46:07,600 --> 02:46:10,539
gram so I was a little bit right about

4264
02:46:09,189 --> 02:46:12,970
that they grew too much and it's getting

4265
02:46:10,539 --> 02:46:14,289
cheaper nevertheless in addition to

4266
02:46:12,969 --> 02:46:15,938
tourists eager to visit the city's

4267
02:46:14,289 --> 02:46:17,649
historic first legal pot shop his

4268
02:46:15,939 --> 02:46:21,158
clientele primarily consists of

4269
02:46:17,648 --> 02:46:22,748
customers in the 25 and older range it's

4270
02:46:21,158 --> 02:46:24,788
more of an adult demographic but that's

4271
02:46:22,748 --> 02:46:26,340
okay he says they have jobs and they can

4272
02:46:24,789 --> 02:46:28,869
afford to buy the product

4273
02:46:26,340 --> 02:46:30,398
the next headline says so what's next

4274
02:46:28,869 --> 02:46:32,680
Rick Garza director of the Washington's

4275
02:46:30,398 --> 02:46:34,208
liquor board a Liquor Control Board soon

4276
02:46:32,680 --> 02:46:36,100
to be renamed the liquor and cannabis

4277
02:46:34,209 --> 02:46:38,680
board says he's proud of Washington's

4278
02:46:36,100 --> 02:46:40,359
efforts at a meeting to the top run at

4279
02:46:38,680 --> 02:46:41,859
meeting the top priorities the Justice

4280
02:46:40,359 --> 02:46:43,449
Department laid out when it announced it

4281
02:46:41,859 --> 02:46:44,619
would allow Washington Colorado and

4282
02:46:43,449 --> 02:46:46,840
other states to regulate marijuana

4283
02:46:44,619 --> 02:46:48,399
keeping criminal organizations out of

4284
02:46:46,840 --> 02:46:50,680
the industry keeping the marijuana

4285
02:46:48,398 --> 02:46:55,809
in-state and keeping pot away from the

4286
02:46:50,680 --> 02:46:57,670
kids financial investigations of pot

4287
02:46:55,809 --> 02:46:59,109
license applicants and caps the total

4288
02:46:57,670 --> 02:47:01,600
amount of production to try to keep it

4289
02:46:59,109 --> 02:47:03,039
in line with in-state demand while

4290
02:47:01,600 --> 02:47:04,568
public health advocates say they wish

4291
02:47:03,039 --> 02:47:06,670
the state had done more to stress the

4292
02:47:04,568 --> 02:47:08,260
potential harms of pot to teens the

4293
02:47:06,670 --> 02:47:09,609
state required strict packaging and

4294
02:47:08,260 --> 02:47:11,469
labeling requirements to keep children

4295
02:47:09,609 --> 02:47:12,760
from getting into the weed they did the

4296
02:47:11,469 --> 02:47:15,158
same thing here we kind of set a little

4297
02:47:12,760 --> 02:47:17,408
standard here I think the products that

4298
02:47:15,158 --> 02:47:20,038
appeal to kids also remain banned no

4299
02:47:17,408 --> 02:47:22,328
marijuana cotton candy or gummy bears

4300
02:47:20,039 --> 02:47:23,859
also clawed you can't get the sweets no

4301
02:47:22,328 --> 02:47:24,809
bears up there that's terrible I'm sorry

4302
02:47:23,859 --> 02:47:27,760
bro

4303
02:47:24,809 --> 02:47:30,728
everything here sold them childproof

4304
02:47:27,760 --> 02:47:31,899
packaging so even the candy bars come in

4305
02:47:30,728 --> 02:47:35,050
a pill bottle right

4306
02:47:31,899 --> 02:47:37,479
essentially so it's not like they look

4307
02:47:35,050 --> 02:47:42,729
like what your kids eat or it can be

4308
02:47:37,479 --> 02:47:44,020
confused easily so the article wraps up

4309
02:47:42,729 --> 02:47:45,369
to say this isn't the first time people

4310
02:47:44,021 --> 02:47:46,811
have gone to Oregon to buy something

4311
02:47:45,370 --> 02:47:48,790
either because it's cheaper or because

4312
02:47:46,810 --> 02:47:50,681
they don't apply sales tax he said we

4313
02:47:48,790 --> 02:47:53,051
saw it for liquor and we see it for

4314
02:47:50,681 --> 02:47:55,450
tobacco so they're making a ton of money

4315
02:47:53,050 --> 02:47:57,369
in Washington and they may have grown

4316
02:47:55,450 --> 02:47:58,931
too much cannabis which is fine because

4317
02:47:57,370 --> 02:48:01,360
they're pushing down the prices right

4318
02:47:58,931 --> 02:48:03,700
I'm gonna do this one more article this

4319
02:48:01,360 --> 02:48:05,110
is also from Washington I know guys I'm

4320
02:48:03,700 --> 02:48:07,061
in Colorado but I like to share the news

4321
02:48:05,110 --> 02:48:09,069
from all over the place this one says

4322
02:48:07,060 --> 02:48:11,170
Washington cracking down on unlicensed

4323
02:48:09,069 --> 02:48:12,310
medical marijuana stores we don't even

4324
02:48:11,170 --> 02:48:16,149
have to read the whole article here

4325
02:48:12,310 --> 02:48:18,399
because this articles by Martha Belial

4326
02:48:16,149 --> 02:48:20,319
from The Associated Press and I hope I

4327
02:48:18,399 --> 02:48:22,359
said your last name right said 15

4328
02:48:20,319 --> 02:48:24,789
unlicensed medical marijuana shops in

4329
02:48:22,360 --> 02:48:26,980
unincorporated King County are on notice

4330
02:48:24,790 --> 02:48:28,870
that they are violating the law gene

4331
02:48:26,979 --> 02:48:31,000
County Prosecutor dan Centerburg and

4332
02:48:28,870 --> 02:48:32,170
Sheriff John something said Wednesday

4333
02:48:31,000 --> 02:48:33,601
that they were tracking down on these

4334
02:48:32,170 --> 02:48:36,250
stores after Washington lawmakers

4335
02:48:33,601 --> 02:48:39,011
amended initiative 502 to require

4336
02:48:36,250 --> 02:48:40,479
licenses for all pot shops the change in

4337
02:48:39,011 --> 02:48:43,720
the law brought medical marijuana into

4338
02:48:40,479 --> 02:48:45,550
the state licensing and tax scheme Satur

4339
02:48:43,720 --> 02:48:47,109
Berg said the stores were notified by

4340
02:48:45,550 --> 02:48:49,209
mail this week and if they continue to

4341
02:48:47,110 --> 02:48:50,980
operate as unlicensed retail outlets for

4342
02:48:49,209 --> 02:48:53,529
the black market they'll face civil and

4343
02:48:50,979 --> 02:48:54,939
criminal ramifications so these shops

4344
02:48:53,530 --> 02:48:57,551
are not registered and they are

4345
02:48:54,940 --> 02:49:00,040
operating like medical marijuana

4346
02:48:57,550 --> 02:49:02,140
dispensaries it says the 15 stores that

4347
02:49:00,040 --> 02:49:04,690
received a notice include seven in the

4348
02:49:02,140 --> 02:49:05,890
white sinner neighborhood two in Skyway

4349
02:49:04,690 --> 02:49:07,511
and six in the eastern part of the

4350
02:49:05,890 --> 02:49:09,341
county messages left at Northwest

4351
02:49:07,511 --> 02:49:11,351
cannabis mark in Seattle and military

4352
02:49:09,341 --> 02:49:13,720
road wholistic in Auburn were not

4353
02:49:11,351 --> 02:49:15,250
immediately returned there was no answer

4354
02:49:13,720 --> 02:49:17,859
at Pacific Coast natural medicine in

4355
02:49:15,250 --> 02:49:19,030
Seattle or the solution Renton so these

4356
02:49:17,860 --> 02:49:20,170
people are not answering the phones

4357
02:49:19,030 --> 02:49:22,601
because they're scared shitless they're

4358
02:49:20,170 --> 02:49:24,040
gonna get raided probably they're taking

4359
02:49:22,601 --> 02:49:25,150
tax money from the state and operating

4360
02:49:24,040 --> 02:49:27,370
in locations that would never be

4361
02:49:25,149 --> 02:49:29,229
approved by the LCB he said they are

4362
02:49:27,370 --> 02:49:31,811
blight on the neighborhoods they inhibit

4363
02:49:29,229 --> 02:49:33,579
that's that's a matter of opinion

4364
02:49:31,810 --> 02:49:35,170
he said the federal government is

4365
02:49:33,579 --> 02:49:37,091
washing watching how Washington

4366
02:49:35,170 --> 02:49:38,829
regulates the marijuana industry and the

4367
02:49:37,091 --> 02:49:40,780
success of the law depends on how well

4368
02:49:38,829 --> 02:49:42,129
local jurisdictions deal with unlicensed

4369
02:49:40,780 --> 02:49:43,510
retail stores

4370
02:49:42,129 --> 02:49:45,429
addition to sending notifications to the

4371
02:49:43,510 --> 02:49:47,200
15 stores County officials have notified

4372
02:49:45,430 --> 02:49:49,270
landlords there's an illegal business

4373
02:49:47,200 --> 02:49:50,710
operating on the property he said this

4374
02:49:49,270 --> 02:49:52,090
means that if the stores continue to

4375
02:49:50,709 --> 02:49:53,739
operate illegally the liquor and

4376
02:49:52,090 --> 02:49:56,530
cannabis board can go in and seize all

4377
02:49:53,739 --> 02:49:57,760
of the product if the civil options

4378
02:49:56,530 --> 02:50:00,729
don't work they'll consider criminal

4379
02:49:57,760 --> 02:50:02,800
remedies he said heavy-handed on this he

4380
02:50:00,728 --> 02:50:04,659
said we're telling them the new scheme

4381
02:50:02,799 --> 02:50:22,449
has to be followed the days of the Wild

4382
02:50:04,659 --> 02:50:25,898
West are over in Colorado for a while I

4383
02:50:22,450 --> 02:50:27,579
also was accused of blasting buds making

4384
02:50:25,898 --> 02:50:29,559
pho out of the buds and selling those

4385
02:50:27,579 --> 02:50:31,799
buds that he blasted back on the black

4386
02:50:29,559 --> 02:50:31,799
market

4387
02:50:32,250 --> 02:50:35,540
[Music]

4388
02:50:37,139 --> 02:50:41,349
storefronts advertising and their

4389
02:50:39,398 --> 02:50:43,269
advertising just like a normal store and

4390
02:50:41,350 --> 02:50:45,250
now they're gonna either have to get

4391
02:50:43,270 --> 02:50:47,500
raided I hope they don't bring it to

4392
02:50:45,250 --> 02:50:49,360
that because this is what sucks you have

4393
02:50:47,500 --> 02:50:51,340
a state that allows you to do this and

4394
02:50:49,360 --> 02:50:56,079
then people like this don't follow the

4395
02:50:51,340 --> 02:50:57,610
rules and they [ __ ] it up for this down

4396
02:50:56,079 --> 02:50:59,709
if they don't they're gonna get raided

4397

like no one questioned it when we were

4440
02:52:44,290 --> 02:52:49,510
kids and now that dam is breaking and if

4441

unlegal states now which is crosses I
