98
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:30,000
redirect I'm also going to be doing

99
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:31,919
testing a little bit differently here in

100
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,900
the next year before I've been taking

101
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:35,699
tester applications through emails and

102
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,860
through the Discord I'm not going to be

103
00:03:35,699 --> 00:03:39,299
doing as much of that if you sent an

104
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:41,099
application to be a tester those are

105
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,719
still in the running those will still be

106
00:03:41,098 --> 00:03:44,280
considered I do go through those

107
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:46,799
randomly when I have some time and pick

108
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,658
out some folks but I do have a strategy

109
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:51,360
of how I want to do the testers in the

110
00:03:48,658 --> 00:03:53,340
upcoming year my new plan is to do two

111
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,440
testers every month I would like to do

112
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:58,019
one regular and one feminized cross

113
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:59,818
every month so far I've got a few months

114
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:01,860
of test seeds planned out and prepared

115
00:03:59,818 --> 00:04:03,060
from previous Harvest from Summer runs

116
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,379
and things like that I've got a lot of

117
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:06,180
seeds stockpiled that you guys have

118
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:08,098
never seen never heard of I want to get

119
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:10,680
those out and get those in testing so I

120
00:04:08,098 --> 00:04:13,139
like to do one feminized and one regular

121
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,939
strain for testing every month for the

122
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:17,219
next six to eight hopefully even maybe

123
00:04:14,938 --> 00:04:18,959
up to the next 12 months so that means

124
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:21,000
every month we'll have two new testers

125
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,439
some of those will not make it some of

126
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,478
those will make it but you guys will get

127
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:26,759
to see most of the testing that goes on

128
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:29,459
for the next year so I'll be putting out

129
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:31,919
two testers every month for the next

130
00:04:29,459 --> 00:04:33,899
year these new testers will be released

131
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:36,120
in limited batches and they will be

132
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:38,399
available in a couple of different ways

133
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:40,620
a lot of them will be given away with

134
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:42,899
orders on I redirect so if you order

135
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:45,300
from ire direct every month you've got

136
00:04:42,899 --> 00:04:46,978
the opportunity to get one or two new

137
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,600
tester packs from me everybody gets

138
00:04:46,978 --> 00:04:50,819
freebies when you order on I redirect

139
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,680
part of those freebies will be free

140
00:04:50,819 --> 00:04:54,899
tester packs a lot of people love

141
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,280
getting that brand new stuff you've got

142
00:04:54,899 --> 00:04:57,899
something nobody else has because you've

143
00:04:56,279 --> 00:05:00,239
got it before everybody because you are

144
00:04:57,899 --> 00:05:01,620
a tester you may have the next big

145
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,900
winner you may have the next champion

146
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:05,340
from my line you may get to test grow it

147
00:05:03,899 --> 00:05:08,698
before everybody else if you were

148
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:10,019
growing for a a profitable gain that may

149
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:12,478
set you apart from the rest of the

150
00:05:10,019 --> 00:05:14,758
market that may really help you out so

151
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:17,639
they will be going out as freebies on I

152
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:20,340
redirect I will also add them to I

153
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:21,360
redirect for a very low price I'll be

154
00:05:20,339 --> 00:05:23,038
putting I've been doing it I've been

155
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,020
putting Big Mountain fudge cake testers

156
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:27,060
on the website they went very very well

157
00:05:25,019 --> 00:05:28,620
I put the testers clearly labeled that

158
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:30,538
they are testers I put them at a very

159
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:32,459
reasonable price there's a little note

160
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:34,019
attached to the package that lets you

161
00:05:32,459 --> 00:05:35,758
know what you can expect lets you know

162
00:05:34,019 --> 00:05:37,198
what I expect there's a link to the

163
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,060
Discord that way you can sign up to our

164
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,160
Discord and post all of your tester

165
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:43,560
photos and information to the Discord

166
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:45,000
tester tab so there are two ways to get

167
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,280
the new test receipts they will be

168
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,620
coming as freebies from orders on I

169
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:52,379
redirect and also I may add some of them

170
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:54,538
randomly to the iredirect website for a

171
00:05:52,379 --> 00:05:57,839
very limited price and again those will

172
00:05:54,538 --> 00:05:59,399
be at very limited quantities if you

173
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:00,779
have tested for me in the past don't

174
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:02,819
feel like you're going to get left out

175
00:06:00,779 --> 00:06:04,379
I've got a list of testers I see your

176
00:06:02,819 --> 00:06:06,599
pictures I see your names in my computer

177
00:06:04,379 --> 00:06:08,939
in my phone don't worry you will not get

178
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,199
left out I do consider you for testing

179
00:06:08,939 --> 00:06:11,939
in the future if you've already been

180
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:14,400
testing and you want more tester seeds

181
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:16,439
reach out either via email or on Discord

182
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:17,939
let me know say hey bro I finished up

183
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:19,800
the last run of testers here are the

184
00:06:17,939 --> 00:06:22,199
pictures really love to run a new batch

185
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,939
for you I like repeat offenders if you

186
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:25,139
come back and test for me again that

187
00:06:23,939 --> 00:06:26,459
means that you under understood the

188
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:28,319
assignment the first time he probably

189
00:06:26,459 --> 00:06:29,579
did a good job I'll probably give you

190
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,439
seeds again and we'll keep it going

191
00:06:29,579 --> 00:06:33,839
we'll keep your garden fresh keep it new

192
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:35,879
keep my photos keep my data coming we'll

193
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:37,439
work out together very well like that so

194
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:39,180
so don't feel like you're going to get

195
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:41,100
left behind or pushed out or forgotten

196
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:42,840
if you've been testing for me before I

197
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,639
just want to establish new relationships

198
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:46,500
with new testers because if you haven't

199
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,300
noticed I've been making a lot of seeds

200
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:50,100
and I need to get them out there and I'd

201
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:51,900
like to get them thoroughly tested so we

202
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:54,120
can get them to the people who need to

203
00:06:51,899 --> 00:06:56,099
grow them I know I mentioned this just a

204
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:58,259
moment ago but if you do get tester

205
00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:00,600
seeds please join the Discord and post

206
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:02,819
photos of those tester seats in the ire

207
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,439
genetics tester tab if you're on the

208
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:06,660
Discord on the left side if you scroll

209
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:08,160
down on the ire genetics Discord there

210
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:10,319
are a bunch of tabs different places to

211
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,180
go there's one that says testers click

212
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,740
on there you can post your pictures you

213
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:15,538
can post data you can scroll up and see

214
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:17,100
what other people are posting you can

215
00:07:15,538 --> 00:07:18,659
either follow the kind of guideline or

216
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:20,879
you can set the standard and create new

217
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:22,380
trends post any of the information you

218
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:23,579
think I might want to know how long you

219
00:07:22,379 --> 00:07:25,860
grew it how many of the plants

220
00:07:23,579 --> 00:07:27,899
germinated how long you flowered it for

221
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:29,819
if you noticed anything weird let me

222
00:07:27,899 --> 00:07:31,620
know any details you think may be

223
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:34,379
interesting to myself or other people

224
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:36,000
growing that strain in the future all

225
00:07:34,379 --> 00:07:37,978
right I think that covers testers you

226
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,379
guys let's move forward to the main

227
00:07:37,978 --> 00:07:42,719
chunk of this podcast of course we are

228
00:07:40,379 --> 00:07:44,759
entering a brand new year here a lot of

229
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,039
people like that new year new me new

230
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:49,259
year new start sort of stuff why not use

231
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:51,360
this new calendar year as a new goal

232
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:52,919
setting phase a new time phase to start

233
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,439
fresh and get things going start

234
00:07:52,918 --> 00:07:57,120
documenting doing things properly let's

235
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:59,219
jump into it and talk a little bit more

236
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,160
about creating a good start and a good

237
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:04,440
strategy for a brand new year in my

238
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,300
opinion everything goes better with a

239
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:08,339
good strategy with a good plan with a

240
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:10,199
good expected outcome with sort of a

241
00:08:08,339 --> 00:08:11,939
plan of what could go wrong what to look

242
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:14,280
for and how to react to those things as

243
00:08:11,939 --> 00:08:16,620
it happens if you go into things blindly

244
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:18,839
you didn't have no idea how that [ __ ] is

245
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:20,879
going to turn out not just in growing

246
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:22,679
but almost everything in life works that

247
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,120
way the better you prepare the more you

248
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,680
plan the better it's going to go of

249
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,598
course you got to be spontaneous and

250
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,879
have some fun the girl works that way

251
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:32,098
too but if we've got a strategy got an

252
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:34,139
idea have a an expected goal written

253
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:36,500
down it is easier to reflect on things

254
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:39,598
and see where we are with our progress

255
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:41,940
so my question to you is do you have a

256
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,379
goal for your grow this year is there

257
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:44,700
something you want to improve on is

258
00:08:43,379 --> 00:08:47,159
there something you want to work on

259
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:49,140
let's talk about a few goals that you

260
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:51,299
could have in your grow room for this

261
00:08:49,139 --> 00:08:53,519
year maybe the first thing I would do is

262
00:08:51,299 --> 00:08:56,099
identify the weak spot what are you not

263
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:59,220
good at in the grow room for a long time

264
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:00,600
my weak spot was cloning I told one of

265
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:02,700
my friends I said hey bro I really suck

266
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,200
at cloning and I've done a full podcast

267
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,759
about this and he came over and he

268
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:08,220
showed me step by step how to make

269
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:10,379
clones guess what now my clone game is

270
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:11,759
on top of [ __ ] figure out what your

271
00:09:10,379 --> 00:09:13,919
weakness is find out where you're

272
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:15,958
lacking in the grow let's identify that

273
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:18,299
and let's make that your strongest part

274
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:19,859
of the grow the next time we'll identify

275
00:09:18,299 --> 00:09:21,479
the next weakness and we'll make that

276
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:23,519
the strongest part and we'll just keep

277
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,620
leapfrogging your weaknesses into your

278
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,299
strongest points in the grow so let's

279
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:29,100
identify the weakness maybe you're not

280
00:09:27,299 --> 00:09:30,599
good at cloning maybe you're really not

281
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:32,040
good at lollipopping maybe you don't

282
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,839
know how to pop and twist maybe you're

283
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:35,219
no good at working a trellis maybe

284
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,779
there's things that you need to work on

285
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:39,300
in the grow that I'm not even aware of

286
00:09:36,778 --> 00:09:40,740
so identify your biggest weakness in the

287
00:09:39,299 --> 00:09:42,539
grow maybe you're not good at taking

288
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:43,919
clones maybe you're not good at popping

289
00:09:42,539 --> 00:09:46,019
and twisting maybe you're not good at

290
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:47,458
lollipopping maybe you've never topped a

291
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:48,899
plant because you're afraid maybe you

292
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:51,359
don't know how to work a trellis or a

293
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:53,339
scrog identify your weakness and let's

294
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,659
fix that right here at the start of the

295
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:57,240
Year let's make that one of the first

296
00:09:54,659 --> 00:09:58,860
projects that we correct some of the

297
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,419
things we do in the grow are are more

298
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:02,039
measurable than others the amount of

299
00:10:00,419 --> 00:10:03,958
effort we put in the amount of time we

300
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:05,939
spend in there the amount of work we do

301
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:07,799
that's only measurable by hours and

302
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:09,779
actually by the outcome things that we

303
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:12,359
can actually measure though are how much

304
00:10:09,778 --> 00:10:13,980
product did you produce last year do you

305
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:17,459
know how much herb you produced in the

306
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:20,159
last 365 days are you a flower grower

307
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:22,500
how much usable smokable flour did you

308
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:25,199
produce are you a concentrate maker how

309
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:27,480
much usable smokable concentrate did you

310
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,800
produce then the next question what

311
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,300
happened to all that do you have

312
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:32,579
something to show for it did you smoke

313
00:10:30,299 --> 00:10:34,139
all of it which is just fine you grew it

314
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:36,240
to consume it but if you are somebody

315
00:10:34,139 --> 00:10:37,919
who is making a profit or providing a

316
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,720
product to somebody what happened to

317
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:41,819
that product is was there income made

318
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:43,560
from that product what happened to that

319
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:45,120
money did that go somewhere did you put

320
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:47,159
that in the bank did you buy sneakers

321
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,720
with it are you living off a part of it

322
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:50,699
did you invest part of it into the grow

323
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,680
where did that money go so the first

324
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:54,839
question how much product did you

325
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:56,519
produce in the last year like I said if

326
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:58,200
you're a flower producer how much flour

327
00:10:56,519 --> 00:11:00,360
if you're a concentrate maker how much

328
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:02,339
concentrate did you produce then where

329
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,560
did that go did you smoke it did you

330
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:06,060
move it then where did the money go now

331
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:07,259
let's think about these things did you

332
00:11:06,059 --> 00:11:09,179
produce enough

333
00:11:07,259 --> 00:11:10,860
out of what you produced did you have

334
00:11:09,179 --> 00:11:12,899
enough to smoke did you have enough to

335
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:14,700
do whatever you're doing with it then if

336
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:16,860
money was made from that product did you

337
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:19,620
make enough money to cover your work

338
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:21,300
your energy your costs and then have

339
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:23,820
enough money to make it worth your time

340
00:11:21,299 --> 00:11:25,740
those are things I would think about so

341
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:27,899
how much product did you produce in the

342
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:30,120
last year and the next question is how

343
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:31,799
much do you plan to produce in the next

344
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,659
year are you going to increase your

345
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:35,458
production or are you okay with the

346
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:37,439
amount that you produced can you

347
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:39,479
increase production with your space can

348
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,459
you increase production 10 20 maybe 30

349
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:43,740
percent with the room space you've got

350
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:45,539
if you put more time and energy into it

351
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:47,459
could you do that I don't know I don't

352
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:49,500
know how hard you worked last year but

353
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:52,018
that is a goal that I would set how much

354
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:55,078
more product am I going to produce this

355
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:58,379
year my next question is on a scale of

356
00:11:55,078 --> 00:12:00,299
one to ten how good is your product and

357
00:11:58,379 --> 00:12:01,799
this is where people get really messed

358
00:12:00,299 --> 00:12:04,019
up in their heads you have got to be

359
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:07,199
honest with yourself about your product

360
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:10,019
on a scale of 1 to 10 how good is your

361
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,339
product you may say out loud it's a 10

362
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:12,839
because everybody's going to say their

363
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:15,000
herb is a 10 but you may know inside

364
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:17,160
that that shit's a four and you got to

365
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,019
work on getting it up to a six so be

366
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:21,059
honest with yourself give your herb an

367
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:23,278
honest assessment compare it to a lot of

368
00:12:21,059 --> 00:12:25,199
other herb find other Growers that you

369
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:26,578
respect don't put yourself in a group of

370
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,379
Growers that you think you are better

371
00:12:26,578 --> 00:12:29,699
Growers than them and compare your herb

372
00:12:28,379 --> 00:12:31,860
to it because of course it'll be better

373
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:33,540
go find Growers that you respect that

374
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:35,278
you think are better Growers than you

375
00:12:33,539 --> 00:12:36,539
also hang out with the Growers that you

376
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:37,980
think you're better than them all of you

377
00:12:36,539 --> 00:12:40,019
put your herb in the table and compare

378
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:41,940
it let's see what everybody's doing find

379
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:43,860
out where you really stand in the game

380
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:45,360
and be honest with yourself if the

381
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:47,879
shit's not selling if it's not moving

382
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,459
that's a three or a four bro 10 level 10

383
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:51,659
weed [ __ ] moves itself level 10 weed

384
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:53,338
you don't have to sell it that [ __ ]

385
00:12:51,659 --> 00:12:55,439
sells itself you just gotta drive it to

386
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:57,180
the next customer so give your weed a

387
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,399
reasonable assessment on a scale of one

388
00:12:57,179 --> 00:13:01,679
to ten how good is it if you can get a

389
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:02,700
lab test a potency test which again

390
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:04,259
that's going to raise a lot of

391
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:06,360
controversy but maybe you've got a lab

392
00:13:04,259 --> 00:13:08,220
test to compare it to what's your THC

393
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:10,079
percentage your CB D percentage what's

394
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:12,120
your terpene percentage can we increase

395
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:14,159
and improve on those numbers or can you

396
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:16,019
just grow herb that you think is better

397
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:17,458
than the herb you're growing now on a

398
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:20,039
scale of one to ten how good is your

399
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:21,659
weed if it's a five what would make it a

400
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:23,338
seven if it's a seven what would make it

401
00:13:21,659 --> 00:13:25,919
an eight if it's an eight what would

402
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:27,360
make it a ten identify the issue was it

403
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:28,860
something with the nutrients was it

404
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,539
something in the dry and cure did you

405
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:32,519
over water it did the room get too hot

406
00:13:30,539 --> 00:13:34,078
can you tell by looking at the buds that

407
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:35,820
there was a fungus nap problem or can

408
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:37,500
you tell by looking at the flowers that

409
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,760
there was a root aphid problem or can

410
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,860
you tell by looking at the shape of the

411
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:43,379
Clusters and the little tiny misshapen

412
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:45,778
buds that there was a a russet my issue

413
00:13:43,379 --> 00:13:47,759
can you tell those things correct those

414
00:13:45,778 --> 00:13:50,700
issues does it taste funky was it too

415
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:52,679
leafy did you let it get too dry correct

416
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:54,600
those issues you can see the problems

417
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:57,599
let's take your herb from a six to an

418
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,920
eight or an eight possibly to a ten if

419
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,420
you can do it of course you got to get

420
00:13:58,919 --> 00:14:03,059
your ego out of the way to be able to do

421
00:14:00,419 --> 00:14:05,099
that one now here's some more fun things

422
00:14:03,059 --> 00:14:06,719
to talk about how many strains do you

423
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,980
want to try this year do you know what

424
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,720
you want to grow are you going to grow

425
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:11,940
the same old [ __ ] or do you have a few

426
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:13,560
strains Chosen and selected on your menu

427
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:15,300
that you'd like to try to run this year

428
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:16,979
do you have a schedule do you have a

429
00:14:15,299 --> 00:14:18,958
plan do you know how many crops you're

430
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:20,940
going to turn this year have you divided

431
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:22,739
the amount of days you used to Flower by

432
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:24,120
the amount of days in the year to see

433
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:25,740
how many crops you can fit in that

434
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,720
flower room and see if you can cram One

435
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:29,639
More In by doing something weird by just

436
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,259
using space over here to move move this

437
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:32,399
room from Veg to flour a week early

438
00:14:31,259 --> 00:14:34,078
while they're all in there and then

439
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,120
maybe I could squeeze in one more crop

440
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:37,620
this year have you done that math that

441
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:40,078
stuff that I start thinking about right

442
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:41,820
now at the beginning of the year which

443
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:43,679
breeders are you going to support this

444
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:44,820
year of course I recommend you buy irie

445
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:46,319
genetic seeds you're going to find some

446
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:48,240
good [ __ ] in there but there are tons of

447
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,220
other great breeders out there putting

448
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,659
out great products who are you going to

449
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:54,300
support this year what strains from

450
00:14:51,659 --> 00:14:56,278
which breeders do you plan to grow then

451
00:14:54,299 --> 00:14:58,620
my next question is are you breeding do

452
00:14:56,278 --> 00:15:00,720
you have breeding goals uh what is your

453
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:03,120
breeding goal for the year do you plan

454
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,100
to F2 something are you going to F3

455
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,839
something or how far are you gonna go

456
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:08,639
are you gonna make a new cross how many

457
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:11,220
new two crosses are you going to make

458
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:14,278
how many overall seeds do you plan or

459
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:15,839
attend or intend anticipate making in

460
00:15:14,278 --> 00:15:18,059
the next calendar year those are things

461
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,920
to write down if you're a seed breeder

462
00:15:18,059 --> 00:15:21,299
what is your goal for seed breeding are

463
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,919
you trying to get those seeds to Market

464
00:15:21,299 --> 00:15:24,359
are you trying to make seeds for you are

465
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:25,919
you trying to make seeds for the homies

466
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:28,199
what are you trying to do you're trying

467
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:30,120
to isolate a terpene a cannabinoid a

468
00:15:28,198 --> 00:15:32,039
trait write down those goals and figure

469
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:34,379
out what you want to do as a breeder

470
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:36,539
this year as a grower you need very

471
00:15:34,379 --> 00:15:38,458
specific calendars and ideas and goals

472
00:15:36,539 --> 00:15:40,198
as a breeder those are even more

473
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:42,719
specific so let's get to setting some

474
00:15:40,198 --> 00:15:44,278
goals writing down a plan setting up

475
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,540
some ideas so that we know where we're

476
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:47,519
driving we're not just running through

477
00:15:45,539 --> 00:15:49,319
this year with no map let's get the map

478
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:52,500
printed out so we can all end up at the

479
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:54,660
same winning destination is there

480
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:56,339
something in your grow a chore a task a

481
00:15:54,659 --> 00:15:58,139
mess a problem that you've been avoiding

482
00:15:56,339 --> 00:15:59,519
let's do that right here at the start of

483
00:15:58,139 --> 00:16:01,019
the Year let's correct it if it's a

484
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:02,940
problem that needs to be fixed and cost

485
00:16:01,019 --> 00:16:04,560
some money let's throw some money at it

486
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:06,720
and fix it if it's a mess you need to

487
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:09,179
clean up get in there and clean it up if

488
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,500
it's shelf that needs to be reorganized

489
00:16:09,179 --> 00:16:12,419
or a bunch of [ __ ] that needs to be

490
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:14,399
thrown away or lights that need to be

491
00:16:12,419 --> 00:16:15,659
re-hung let's just do that right here at

492
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,820
the start of the Year let's bang it out

493
00:16:15,659 --> 00:16:19,559
get it out of the way start fresh so we

494
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:21,600
can just rock this whole year nice and

495
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:23,879
smooth find that task you've been

496
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,220
avoiding identify it let's make it a

497
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:29,939
habit to do that task make it enjoyable

498
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:31,620
feel some pride when you do it now also

499
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:34,199
this is a good time to clean everything

500
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:35,698
up this is the first of the year all

501
00:16:34,198 --> 00:16:37,078
that stuff that needs to be cleaned you

502
00:16:35,698 --> 00:16:38,879
know what I'm talking about I like to

503
00:16:37,078 --> 00:16:40,739
start from the top and work my way down

504
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:42,240
look at the lights the tops of the

505
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:43,980
lights are probably Dusty I don't know

506
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,419
what kind of Lights you've got the tops

507
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:47,399
of whatever lights you're using they're

508
00:16:45,419 --> 00:16:48,778
probably Dusty and need a dusting so get

509
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:50,698
up there and clean those lights get a

510
00:16:48,778 --> 00:16:52,740
ladder out you guys get a ladder a

511
00:16:50,698 --> 00:16:54,838
couple of Rags some spray bottles some

512
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:56,639
cleaner let's get to work and clean all

513
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:58,560
this [ __ ] up start at the top and work

514
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,539
our way down just wipe everything down

515
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:02,638
if you've got air conditioning if you've

516
00:17:00,539 --> 00:17:04,139
got ducting if you've got venting it

517
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,359
probably all needs to be wiped down

518
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:07,799
clean the tables clean the trays let's

519
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:09,719
clean everything of course course here

520
00:17:07,798 --> 00:17:11,279
in Colorado it's like 20 degrees so

521
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:13,679
taking [ __ ] outside and hosing it down

522
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:14,818
is not a fun option right now but if

523
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,259
you're in a place where you can load up

524
00:17:14,818 --> 00:17:18,000
the [ __ ] and take it to the car wash one

525
00:17:16,259 --> 00:17:19,318
of those outdoor car washes go spray the

526
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,818
[ __ ] out of everything don't use too

527
00:17:19,318 --> 00:17:22,500
much of that car wash soap just use the

528
00:17:20,818 --> 00:17:24,480
water and the hose there and spray the

529
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:26,759
[ __ ] out of it rinse it real good let's

530
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:29,220
get everything super clean start off

531
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:31,440
nice and clean here for the start of the

532
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:33,539
Year also this is a good time to change

533
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,860
all of your filters

534
00:17:33,539 --> 00:17:36,359
anything that's got to filter

535
00:17:34,859 --> 00:17:38,219
everything's got to filter the air

536
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:40,319
conditioner the humidifier the

537
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:42,720
dehumidifier all those filters in your

538
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:44,220
hydro gear anything with the filter now

539
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,900
is a good time to change it it's the

540
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:47,819
first of the month the first of a new

541
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:50,160
year let's start off with all new

542
00:17:47,819 --> 00:17:52,558
filters I know most of us are using LED

543
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,419
lighting now I do have a couple of high

544
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:56,940
pressure sodium light fixtures in one

545
00:17:54,419 --> 00:17:59,100
grow space because it gets very cold in

546
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:01,980
that building and I use those HPS lights

547
00:17:59,099 --> 00:18:03,899
to keep that grow space warm so at the

548
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:05,759
first of the year I would change the

549
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:07,500
bulbs and those high pressure sodium

550
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:08,940
lamps and what I would do is I would

551
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:12,419
take a piece of duct tape and I would

552
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:13,740
write new bulbs January 1st 2023 and I

553
00:18:12,419 --> 00:18:15,840
would stick that right on either the

554
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:17,940
door to the grow room or I would tape it

555
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:19,798
onto the reflector itself out of the way

556
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:21,538
on the side of the reflector stick that

557
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:23,819
duct tape either on the door or on the

558
00:18:21,538 --> 00:18:25,919
reflector to indicate new bulbs January

559
00:18:23,819 --> 00:18:27,298
1st that way I've got new bulbs in there

560
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,799
most of you don't need to worry about

561
00:18:27,298 --> 00:18:29,759
that because you've got the LEDs but if

562
00:18:28,798 --> 00:18:32,038
you're running something with a

563
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:33,298
switchable bulb why not put new bulbs in

564
00:18:32,038 --> 00:18:35,099
there and mark the date that you did it

565
00:18:33,298 --> 00:18:36,779
do you remember when you switched bulbs

566
00:18:35,099 --> 00:18:39,058
if you're using old lighting not

567
00:18:36,779 --> 00:18:40,980
everybody's in a a legal growing State

568
00:18:39,058 --> 00:18:42,720
not everybody has access to new Modern

569
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:45,599
Gear a lot of people out there are using

570
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,279
old magnetic ballasts and HPS bulbs so

571
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:49,139
switch those out you guys put on a new

572
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:50,700
bulb if you can do that here at the

573
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:52,740
start of the year and definitely mark it

574
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,880
down also mark down when you change all

575
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:55,558
those filters that we talked about

576
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:58,260
changing it's not that hard to write

577
00:18:55,558 --> 00:19:00,178
just either in a notebook or a ledger or

578
00:18:58,259 --> 00:19:03,298
a Google doc or somewhere change my

579
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:04,798
filters change my bulbs January 1st now

580
00:19:03,298 --> 00:19:06,839
if we're changing bulbs and changing

581
00:19:04,798 --> 00:19:08,519
filters you know it's also time to

582
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:10,678
calibrate all of our equipment if you've

583
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:13,259
got a pH pen now is a good time to

584
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:15,780
calibrate that pH pen also if you've got

585
00:19:13,259 --> 00:19:17,339
any automation or room sensors that are

586
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:19,319
checking for moisture humidity

587
00:19:17,339 --> 00:19:21,659
temperature I'm not sure which sensors

588
00:19:19,319 --> 00:19:24,058
you're using but now is a good time to

589
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:25,200
clean them calibrate them and test them

590
00:19:24,058 --> 00:19:27,000
let's make sure that all of the

591
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,700
expensive toys we're buying and using

592
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,919
are taking good care of and up to speed

593
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:34,019
and calibrated so they work the way we

594
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,700
are expecting them to so clean all the

595
00:19:34,019 --> 00:19:37,139
filters calibrate all the gear I don't

596
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:38,519
know what filters I don't know what

597
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:39,720
needs to be cleaned in your grow that's

598
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:41,879
up to you but you've got an air

599
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,798
conditioner filter I'm sure there's

600
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:46,260
probably a dehumidifier filter a

601
00:19:43,798 --> 00:19:48,179
Humidifier filter maybe go clean all the

602
00:19:46,259 --> 00:19:49,859
fans all the fans are super funky I

603
00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:52,500
promise you by now they're dirty Anita

604
00:19:49,859 --> 00:19:55,019
cleaning so do a general inspection and

605
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:56,579
prepare for a big spring cleaning I

606
00:19:55,019 --> 00:19:59,038
mentioned a moment ago that it's 20

607
00:19:56,579 --> 00:20:00,960
degrees here in Colorado I'm going to

608
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:02,519
prepare for a spring cleaning I'm going

609
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,500
to bang out one more crop I know that

610
00:20:02,519 --> 00:20:06,359
that crop will be done by March the

611
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,740
middle of March at the latest by the end

612
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:09,058
of that crop I'm going to tear down the

613
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:11,400
entire room and do a full spring

614
00:20:09,058 --> 00:20:13,319
cleaning re-hang everything all over

615
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,240
again because of course when spring gets

616
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:16,619
here in Colorado we've got to redo some

617
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,880
of the rooms have to be redone and

618
00:20:16,619 --> 00:20:19,798
reconfigured a little bit differently

619
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:22,559
because like I mentioned it's it's been

620
00:20:19,798 --> 00:20:24,000
negative six uh somewhere between uh

621
00:20:22,558 --> 00:20:25,500
it's been cold that you guys don't care

622
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,940
about specific numbers it's been [ __ ]

623
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:29,400
cold but it's going to get the opposite

624
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:31,440
here in about six months it'll be 114

625
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:33,000
degrees so I've got to reconfigure my

626
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,700
grow at the springtime to prepare for

627
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,440
that stuff so get yourself ready for a

628
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,940
spring cleaning if you are in a cold

629
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,460
area definitely inspect the air

630
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:43,320
conditioner the the dehumidifier the

631
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:45,179
humidifier all that stuff that moves all

632
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:47,159
the ducting all the ventilation if

633
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:48,840
you've got CO2 production equipment if

634
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:50,519
it's a burner or if it's tanks

635
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:52,740
definitely inspect all of that [ __ ]

636
00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:54,418
another thing I like to do here at the

637
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:56,339
start of the year is order all of the

638
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:58,620
supplies I anticipate I will need for

639
00:20:56,339 --> 00:21:00,178
the next couple of months shipping is

640
00:20:58,619 --> 00:21:02,219
really expensive sometimes you'll get a

641
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:03,960
deal on ordering things in bulk so I

642
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:05,880
like to just place a big order and get

643
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:07,740
all of the stuff I need all at one time

644
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:10,320
at the start of the Year things like

645
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:11,579
nutrients pesticides and gloves we know

646
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:13,439
we're going to use those you have to

647
00:21:11,579 --> 00:21:15,058
have those things why not order them

648
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,380
here at the start of the Year get them

649
00:21:15,058 --> 00:21:18,538

650
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:21,120

651
00:21:18,538 --> 00:21:22,919
nutrients pesticides gloves things like

652
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:24,418
scissors How many pairs of scissors will

653
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:26,100
you go through in the next couple of

654
00:21:24,419 --> 00:21:27,840
months I know I'll need at least two why

655
00:21:26,099 --> 00:21:30,480
not order two maybe if somebody comes to

656
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:32,759
help I'll need two pairs of scissors uh

657
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,500
ISO I go through a lot of isopropyl

658
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:36,599
alcohol here are not just for cleaning

659
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:38,519
[ __ ] in the grow but also for cleaning

660
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:40,558
[ __ ] my smoking accessories for cleaning

661
00:21:38,519 --> 00:21:42,359
the table everything is sticky here so I

662
00:21:40,558 --> 00:21:43,440
got to order a bunch of iso here at the

663
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:45,479
start of the year just to have it

664
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,519
available what are you using to clean

665
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:49,259
your scissors to prevent the spread of

666
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:51,058
hot plate and viroid are you cleaning

667
00:21:49,259 --> 00:21:52,859
your scissors with anything maybe you

668
00:21:51,058 --> 00:21:54,599
need a small container of bleach in your

669
00:21:52,859 --> 00:21:55,918
grow maybe you need more cleaning

670
00:21:54,599 --> 00:21:58,139
supplies in your grow I don't know

671
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,520
exactly what you need but now is a good

672
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:00,900
time to think about ordering those

673
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:02,700
things you're going to need some

674
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:05,220
cleaning supplies like a mop some sort

675
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:07,019
of a cleaner maybe Rags maybe spray

676
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:08,940
bottles I don't know how you do it but I

677
00:22:07,019 --> 00:22:11,700
know that I need those products other

678
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:14,460
things I think about is refreshing my

679
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:16,080
mixing cups and measuring devices some

680
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:18,000
of my nutrients are powdered I use a

681
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:19,678
scale make sure that scale is nice and

682
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,740
clean make sure it's zeroed and dialed

683
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:24,840
in that way I've got a good measurement

684
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:26,220
my measuring cups are filthy I try to

685
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:27,839
clean them but after a while they get

686
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:30,720
stained I use Liquid nutrients with

687
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:32,759
colors the the Cups have changed colors

688
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,500
they look like [ __ ] it's hard it's not

689
00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:36,000
completely easy to read the measurements

690
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:37,740
I will replace those here at the start

691
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,240
of the year just because I want to make

692
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:42,419
sure I'm measuring my expensive

693
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:43,980
nutrients as accurately as possible so

694
00:22:42,419 --> 00:22:45,240
make a big order order all of the

695
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:47,220
supplies you need here right at the

696
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:48,900
start of the year now that leads me into

697
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:51,298
another part that we should talk about

698
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:53,640
maybe now is a good time to start

699
00:22:51,298 --> 00:22:56,579
keeping a ledger or keeping track of

700
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:59,220
your income and expenses based on your

701
00:22:56,579 --> 00:23:01,259
grow do you have a profit and loss sheet

702
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:03,538
for your grow or any other business

703
00:23:01,259 --> 00:23:05,339
attached to that if you're in an illegal

704
00:23:03,538 --> 00:23:07,500
area and you're growing it business-wise

705
00:23:05,339 --> 00:23:09,298
maybe you don't want all this stuff as

706
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:11,400
easily accessible or readily available

707
00:23:09,298 --> 00:23:12,960
that may be evidence but if you are in a

708
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,640
legal State and you are growing it is

709
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,558
completely reasonable to keep a ledger

710
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:19,140
and a profit and loss sheet based on

711
00:23:16,558 --> 00:23:21,359
your grow what does your grow cost what

712
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:23,700
are you spending on electricity what are

713
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:25,740
you spending on nutrients CO2 all of

714
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:28,140
that stuff adds up and matters write all

715
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:30,240
of that stuff down then document how

716
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:32,400
much product you produced estimate how

717
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,440
much that product is worth and see if

718
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,780
you are making a profit profit or a loss

719
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:38,220
also include your time in there you're

720
00:23:36,779 --> 00:23:40,200
spending time in the grow maybe it's

721
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:42,000
time to start keeping track of how many

722
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:44,159
hours a day or a week you are actually

723
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,720
in that grow space so let's start

724
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:47,880
documenting things like electrical

725
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:49,620
spending nutrient spending how much do

726
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:51,840
all those nutrients cost every bottle

727
00:23:49,619 --> 00:23:54,839
let's write it down how much are you

728
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:56,339
spending on co2 did you buy a CO2 burner

729
00:23:54,839 --> 00:23:58,379
did you buy a setup and are you

730
00:23:56,339 --> 00:24:01,139
replacing bottles every week what are

731
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:02,940
you doing for CO2 augmentation also

732
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:04,620
people don't think about the cost of

733
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:06,000
water it comes out of a faucet you turn

734
00:24:04,619 --> 00:24:07,319
it on it comes out we don't think about

735
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,599
paying for it at the end of the month

736
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:11,158
how much water are you spending do you

737
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:12,538
pay the water bill or does the landlord

738
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:14,640
pay the water bill

739
00:24:12,538 --> 00:24:16,259
if the landlord pays it are they

740
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,759
noticing that you're using extra water

741
00:24:16,259 --> 00:24:20,400
for the grow if it's a small grow

742
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:22,140
probably not if you've got a few lights

743
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,720
they might notice the increase in water

744
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:26,100
fees how about rent for the building if

745
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,960
you're growing in a building that is not

746
00:24:26,099 --> 00:24:29,699
your home you're probably paying extra

747
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:32,100
rent for that building what does that

748
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:33,600
cost you is that eating up your profits

749
00:24:32,099 --> 00:24:36,359
I know it's the only place you've got to

750
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:38,279
do it but let's include that into the

751
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:39,959
cost of doing business here how about

752
00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:41,519
employees do you have a trimmer do you

753
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:43,259
have a bro that comes and helps you or a

754
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:45,240
lady that comes and helps you do you

755
00:24:43,259 --> 00:24:46,859
have security do you have a dog that dog

756
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:48,538
that works security at the Grove that is

757
00:24:46,859 --> 00:24:50,339
a cost you got to feed the dog it's got

758
00:24:48,538 --> 00:24:52,798
to go to the vet that is part of your

759
00:24:50,339 --> 00:24:55,379
cost of doing business for that grow

760
00:24:52,798 --> 00:24:57,240
how about gas do you have to drive to

761
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:58,380
the grow or if the grow is located in

762
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,759
your home you got to walk down there

763
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:01,980
that doesn't cost anything but if you've

764
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:03,779
got to drive a few miles to it that does

765
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:06,659
add up over the year how much does that

766
00:25:03,779 --> 00:25:08,819
gasoline cost speaking of gasoline how

767
00:25:06,659 --> 00:25:11,039
about a backup generator diesel fuel

768
00:25:08,819 --> 00:25:12,480
costs money did you buy a generator did

769
00:25:11,038 --> 00:25:14,519
you have that attached to your breaker

770
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,259
box in your home do you have diesel fuel

771
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:17,819
in that generator do you have all the

772
00:25:16,259 --> 00:25:19,140
switches and jump boxes you needed to

773
00:25:17,819 --> 00:25:21,418
where when the power goes off in your

774
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:22,620
spot that generator fires up immediately

775
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:24,240
in your home so where you don't even

776
00:25:22,619 --> 00:25:26,219
notice there was a missing power do you

777
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,659
have that how much did it cost how much

778
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:29,940
does the diesel fuel that's in their

779
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:31,740
cost if it comes on it immediately

780
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:33,778
starts costing you money that diesel

781
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:35,640
feels running cost any money tick tock

782
00:25:33,778 --> 00:25:36,960
tick tock ching ching ching lushes coins

783
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:39,720
falling through the generator machine

784
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:42,419
right there how much does that cost you

785
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:45,000
what about security costs do you have

786
00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:47,038
security are you security did you buy

787
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,259

service backing up all the video footage

795
00:26:02,099 --> 00:26:06,240
for you most of us have a ring cam or

796

business if you want it to be profitable

802
00:26:15,419 --> 00:26:18,240
if you want to make money off of it if

you've got to document all of this stuff

806
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:26,460
it's how real business does it and

807
00:26:24,298 --> 00:26:28,019

are you paying for I'm not sure the

809
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:31,918
other specifics in your grow but

810
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,538
everything costs money do you have to

811
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:35,159
put up new mylar that you have to buy a

812
00:26:33,538 --> 00:26:37,440
new pen to film do you have to replace a

813
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:39,539
light document all of that stuff a pH

814
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,640
pen PH down all that shit's going to

815
00:26:39,538 --> 00:26:43,140
cost cost money now is a good time to

816
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:45,179
start documenting things and keeping

817
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:47,340
notes for a whole year worth of

818
00:26:45,179 --> 00:26:49,019
bookkeeping you can do this on paper you

819
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:50,939
can do it on Google Sheets you can do it

820
00:26:49,019 --> 00:26:52,500
in uh whatever there's a thousand

821
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:53,880
different methods of doing this as long

822
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:55,980
as you're doing it in some sort of way

823
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:57,360
of making an effort you'll improve on it

824
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:59,278
every year and you'll realize there are

825
00:26:57,359 --> 00:27:01,139
better easier ways to do it so start

826
00:26:59,278 --> 00:27:04,140
making notes start keeping that profit

827
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:05,580
and loss sheet start documenting how

828
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:07,080
many plants did you grow if you can

829
00:27:05,579 --> 00:27:08,759
that's another I've got the words be

830
00:27:07,079 --> 00:27:10,139
careful written right here really big on

831
00:27:08,759 --> 00:27:12,778
my notes

832
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:15,240
um if you can safely document this stuff

833
00:27:12,778 --> 00:27:18,778
document as much as possible how many

834
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:21,599
plants did you grow this run how many

835
00:27:18,778 --> 00:27:23,220
days did they go how much did each plant

836
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:25,500
Harvest what was your total Harvest

837
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:27,058
weight and then how much from that

838
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:28,919
Harvest weight do you think that would

839
00:27:27,058 --> 00:27:31,019
be market value then look back and see

840
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:33,179
what it cost you to produce each gram of

841
00:27:31,019 --> 00:27:34,440
that herb then look and see if like I

842
00:27:33,179 --> 00:27:36,538
said before you've got to pay yourself

843
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:38,580
do you get a salary included in there

844
00:27:36,538 --> 00:27:40,619
maybe including write down how many

845
00:27:38,579 --> 00:27:43,259
hours are in there and see if you even

846
00:27:40,619 --> 00:27:45,058
make a salary let's start marking all of

847
00:27:43,259 --> 00:27:46,980
that down but again be very careful

848
00:27:45,058 --> 00:27:49,558
because that if you're not in a legal

849
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:51,599
state that could be dangerous data so

850
00:27:49,558 --> 00:27:53,399
the most important part here is have a

851
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:55,558
goal but my most important message is

852
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:57,419
have fun and then most importantly that

853
00:27:55,558 --> 00:28:00,178
your mom is going to say be careful and

854
00:27:57,419 --> 00:28:02,520
be safe so have fun have a goal be

855
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:04,679
careful be safe grow from your heart

856
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:07,319
breathe with love and let's kick some

857

858
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:09,658
rough couple of years I don't want to

859
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:11,700

860
00:28:09,659 --> 00:28:13,799

865
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:23,278
us are getting back to normal from it I

866

kind of starting to get back to as close

876
00:28:38,099 --> 00:28:40,619
to normal as we're going to feel like

877
00:28:39,419 --> 00:28:42,659
for a little while it's going to take a

878
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:43,739
while before we feel real normalcy again

879
00:28:42,659 --> 00:28:45,900
