you uh before we get to the news

53
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:59,719
articles I want to talk about something

54
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:02,000
that I watched this weekend uh I didn't

55
00:01:59,718 --> 00:02:04,519
get get to go but I definitely uh jumped

56
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,118
on the internet and saw some replays The

57
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:09,399
Grateful Dead did some shows in Santa

58
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:11,199
Clara this weekend anybody that knows me

59
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:12,640
knows that I'm a huge Grateful Dead fan

60
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:15,359
uh The Grateful Dead has a lot to do

61
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:16,159
with who I am and why I am who I am and

62
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,920
what I

63
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:20,400
am uh I've been a Grateful Dead fan I've

64
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:23,119
been a Jerry Garcia fan I've been a

65
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:26,000
Jamrock fan since uh the early 90s

66
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:28,959
probably 93 no I'm going to say 95 cuz I

67
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,400
moved here late '94 or early '94

68
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:33,920
whatever but anyway my first fish show

69
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:36,480
was $69.95 so I've been listening to the

70
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:38,878
Dead uh fish all of that stuff heavily

71
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:41,518
heavily since 95 I did a whole bunch of

72
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:43,318
fish shows uh me and my best friend Rob

73
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,800
the dude did a whole bunch of Widespread

74
00:02:43,318 --> 00:02:48,280
Panic shows one summer uh summer tour

75
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:50,920
2001 uh we did about 20 shows that was

76
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:53,560
pretty epic so uh The Grateful Dead is a

77
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:56,318
huge part of why I am who I am uh I

78
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:59,199
learned a lot of things on fish tour

79
00:02:56,318 --> 00:03:01,598
lots and uh further Festival parking

80
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:03,399
lots and what have you so I watched

81
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:05,039
these uh so the Grateful Dead go back

82
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,799
together and of course Jerry Garcia is

83
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:09,400
no longer with us he's been gone for

84
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:13,280
several years now uh so filling in Jerry

85
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:15,200
shoes was Trey from fish which you would

86
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,400
think that's like most of fish and

87
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:20,399
Grateful Dead F biggest wet dream but it

88
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,560
almost it was so overhyped and so big

89
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,039
that it just seemed weird to me it

90
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:25,959
seemed like a big commercial thing it

91
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:28,039
seemed right Trey was the dude to choose

92
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:30,199
but it was almost it put up so much hype

93
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:32,878
and so much expectation and so pressure

94
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:34,798
that it was just weird so watching the I

95
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:36,560
didn't I didn't go to the shows uh I

96
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,719
should have gone but that was it's hella

97
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,360
expensive I got a lot of

98
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:40,719
responsibilities I didn't feel like it'd

99
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,680
be right to go take a week off to go to

100
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:46,598
some shows right now uh but I did watch

101
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,480
them online it's the first two shows

102
00:03:46,598 --> 00:03:49,759
that they've done uh these guys have

103
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:50,959
never done a show together so it's the

104
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:52,318
first two shows they've done in public

105
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,360
and they've got three more shows coming

106
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:56,958
up over the Fourth of July

107
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:59,920
weekend I was totally satisfied with

108
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,280
what I saw but it seemed really weird

109
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:03,878
watching it it was like watching A

110
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:06,680
Grateful Dead cover band do Grateful

111
00:04:03,878 --> 00:04:09,759
Dead songs they didn't feel natural they

112
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:11,560
didn't flow something wasn't meshing uh

113
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:13,878
there's not a leader to that band is

114
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:17,000
something that I think I noticed uh that

115
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:18,759
band doesn't have a solid leader um

116
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,120
bobb's trying to lead the band but it

117
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:21,879
doesn't seem like he's able to get

118
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:25,600
control because no one wants to listen

119
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:27,839
to him uh Trey seems timid he doesn't

120
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,080
want to let loose and solo like he

121
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:31,239
should but by the end of the show it

122
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:32,959
felt like everything was right but that

123
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,960
was the end of the second show and that

124
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:36,478
was the end of the weekend and

125
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:38,319
everything was wrapping up so I'm hoping

126
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:40,758
that by the time they get to the Chicago

127
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:42,360
venue uh By the time this show comes out

128
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:44,759
they will be in Chicago and they will be

129
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,800
setting up uh they may have already even

130
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:47,199
played I'm not sure if this will come

131
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,478
out on Thursday or Monday we'll see how

132
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:52,319
things go but I hope I can get it out

133
00:04:49,478 --> 00:04:53,279
for you by Thursday so uh yeah the

134
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:54,719
Grateful Dead they've got some

135
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:56,478
improvement to do hopefully they talk

136
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,240
about what didn't work while they're on

137
00:04:56,478 --> 00:05:00,120
the road and then they figure it out by

138
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,800
the weekend I'm thinking that they saved

139
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,560
up the better songs that they practiced

140
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,360
for not I'm not saying the set list over

141
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:07,319
this weekend wasn't amazing all of the

142
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,800
songs were great but I'm hoping that

143
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:11,918
they saved up some of the more uh Trey

144
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:15,800
didn't sing but for one song this whole

145
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:17,719
weekend so I'm hoping they uh got more

146
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,360
Trey songs lined up for the Chicago

147
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:22,520
shows I'm hoping that we get to hear

148
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,800
terpin station with trayon vocals um

149
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:26,439
there are several that I would like to

150
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:27,800
hear Trey sing so I'm probably boring

151
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:29,879
the hell out of a lot of my fans with my

152
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,319
Grateful Dead talk a lot of people

153
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:32,759
listening but the Greatful Dead's a big

154
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:34,879
part of who I am so I really wanted to

155
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:37,319
talk about that the Greatful Dead

156
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:39,319
they're going to Chicago over the 4th of

157
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:43,120
July weekend check that [ __ ] out that'll

158
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:45,680
be really neat uh so my next uh topic I

159
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,160
have a friend named uh his name is Tim

160
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,879
and he actually has a company that sells

161
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:53,080
a product called a torchless nail and is

162
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:56,120
a torchless dab nail and I've been very

163
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:57,599
curious about this product so uh Tim was

164
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,478
passing through Tim does not live in

165
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,639
Colorado he lives in another state but

166
00:05:59,478 --> 00:06:03,639
he was passing through my town and he

167
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:04,759
was kind enough uh I always in Tim if

168
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:06,079
you're passing through dude you're

169
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:07,680
always invited here to come take some

170
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:09,240
Dabs at my house even if you don't have

171
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,840
cool toys with you even if you don't

172
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:14,199
have top shelf extracts with you you're

173
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:16,399
always welcome uh I did not purchase one

174
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:17,840
at this time but I will in the future um

175
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:19,879
it's not something that's in my budget

176
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:21,119
or my need right now but when I'm ready

177
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:23,199
for it I'm going to grab one of these

178
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,680
things it's called the torchless

179
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:30,280
Nail uh it is a dab nail that attaches

180
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:33,959
to any rig that is basically B

181
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:35,758
operated um so you it's got a battery

182
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:37,439
pack the battery pack is kind of big and

183
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,400
kind of cumbersome to be honest with you

184
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:41,759
it's the size of a remote control but it

185
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:43,679
is heavier than a remote control uh if

186
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,720
you used to drive RC cars it's like an

187
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,720
old RC car battery is what it reminds me

188
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:49,599
of so you plug in this thing has a

189
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,720
plugin that comes undone so you don't

190
00:06:49,598 --> 00:06:52,879
always have to have a cord hanging from

191
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,960
it but you plug it in it charges then

192
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:57,159
the coil attaches to it and then the

193
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:59,478
coil attaches to a bowl piece which fits

194
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:00,560
onto your bong or your rig or whatever

195
00:06:59,478 --> 00:07:03,758
you want to call it whatever you're

196
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,959
using uh it attaches to your glass piece

197
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:08,800
then the battery pack has a button when

198
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:11,638
you hold the button uh that heats up an

199
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:14,720
element inside of the bowl piece that

200
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:16,240
makes your hash uh your shatter you know

201
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,599
what we tried on it was shatter and

202
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,240
butter and wax I did not try solventless

203
00:07:18,598 --> 00:07:23,719
I did not try uh the I didn't try

204
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:26,840
anything else so I only know how this

205
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:30,360
works for Shatter wax and some buttery

206
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:32,198
type hash so we put plenty and you can

207
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,680
stuff this thing with plenty of hash too

208
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:35,720
we put a lot of hash on there like

209
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,000
probably a half a gram and then you push

210
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,840
the button and hold the button and as

211
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
soon as you push it the hash starts

212
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:44,079
melting it takes like it's very little

213
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,839
DeLay So you start token and you once

214
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:47,719
you start getting smoke into your lungs

215
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:49,198
once you start feeling it then I started

216
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,159
kind of Feathering the button just like

217
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,720
Let It Go hold it let it go hold it let

218
00:07:51,158 --> 00:07:54,478
it go hold it because I like to take a

219
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,080
big chunky dab but what I noticed is as

220
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:58,959
soon as you let go of the button it

221
00:07:56,079 --> 00:08:00,758
stops cooking like it as soon as you let

222
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:03,359
go so you can really control your dabs

223
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:06,400
it is kind of nice now the part that I

224
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,960
was concerned with and it did pass my

225
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:09,839
inspection let me say that before I go

226
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:13,038
too far the part that I was concerned

227
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:17,119
with is we've got a wire that goes to a

228
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:18,598
bowl and uh that bowl is heating

229
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,199
something inside of the bowl where I'm

230
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:24,120
keeping my extracts I was worried about

231
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:27,240
heating polyurethane wiring or whatever

232
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:28,959
was inside of that bowl so my friend Tim

233
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:32,000
gave me the Liberty to take this piece

234
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:34,879
apart and inspect it completely so

235
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,519
inside of there it's a glass bowl it

236
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:37,879
looks kind of like your normal bong bowl

237
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:40,839
or if you've got a health stone pipe

238
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:44,439
it's very similar to that it's a glass

239
00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:47,000
bowl with basically a titanium screen

240
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:50,000
inside of it and wrapped around that

241
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
titanium screen is and we weren't sure

242
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,399
if it was copper or brass but wrapped

243
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,799
around that titanium screen is a copper

244
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:59,480
or brass coil it almost looks uh it

245
00:08:57,799 --> 00:09:00,919
almost looks like an alligator clip or a

246
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,800
battery clip for your car like where

247
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:05,360
your car battery goes in it almost looks

248
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:07,799
like that wrapped around a titanium disc

249
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:10,120
placed inside of a glass bowl so as soon

250
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:14,319
as you press the button that that copper

251
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:17,200
or brass uh element essentially heats up

252
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,839
around that titanium disc because of the

253
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,399
electricity flowing through it it heats

254
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:23,160
up and that's what melts your dabs and

255
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:25,320
then as soon as you let go of it you can

256
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:27,199
touch the glass and it's not hot you can

257
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:30,040
hold the glass while you take your dabs

258
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:32,959
and it won't burn you so

259
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:34,958
if you were to maybe think about dabbing

260
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:37,639
in the car on the road and you didn't

261
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:40,679
want to use the torch this device would

262
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:43,519
be perfect uh you just push a little

263
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:46,199
button and you inhale and you get pretty

264
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:48,759
healthy pretty chunky rips uh I have to

265
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:50,519
say the torchless nail is rosta Jeff

266
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:52,879
approved I'm going to give it at least a

267
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:55,039
solid four stars if I could play with it

268
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:57,799
again I would give it five full Stars

269
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:58,958
I've never done a real full rating test

270
00:09:57,799 --> 00:10:00,759
or anything you know what I mean we

271
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:02,000
don't have a rating scale but on a scale

272
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:04,039
of 1 to five I'm going to give it a

273
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,078
solid four and then if I get to play

274
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:08,240
with it a couple more times and learn

275
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:10,519
the button Feathering the technique how

276
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:13,039
much to push and let go that sucker just

277
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:14,799
might get five stars you know I want to

278
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:16,719
compare it I want to take my normal rig

279
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:19,000
with me for a day and take the torchless

280
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,959
nail with me for a day and see which one

281
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,679
I end up hitting on the second day like

282
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:24,399
day one maybe I'll get tired of torching

283
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:26,919
maybe day two or day one I'll get tired

284
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,639
of pushing the button and just see which

285
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:30,719
one I like better but that's enough

286
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:32,399
ranting about the torchless nail uh if

287
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,200
you're interested in a torchless nail

288
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,278

not pay me to say any of this he brought

294
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,839
the nail to be kind to let me check it

295

everything's going well for you so let's

301
00:10:57,799 --> 00:11:02,639
get into some news articles you guys um

302
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:05,919
on two podcasts ago our buddy Mike was

303
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:08,639
here and we talked about a raid a raid

304
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:11,519
where the police officers uh used a

305
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:13,639
battering ram to bash in the door of a

306
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:15,839
dispensary that the dispensary was open

307
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:18,278
and the door was unlocked then they

308
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,320
proceeded to treat all of the customers

309
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:21,879
uh like criminals when nobody was

310
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,680
committing a crime they were actually

311
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:26,278
there to serve a cease and assist order

312
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:28,679
is what they should have done but

313
00:11:26,278 --> 00:11:31,039
instead they went in uh they treated

314
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:33,759
every like criminals they destroyed most

315
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:37,120
of the dispensary oh excuse me I'm

316
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:38,799
burping uh the these cops were complete

317
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,039
[ __ ] what I thought they did was

318
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:42,759
completely disrespectful and apparently

319
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:45,399
some other people did too because there

320
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:48,240
is a news article uh this news article

321
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:50,480
comes from abc7.com I found this on a

322
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,120
lot of different places but uh this

323
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,759
article was the best written and the

324
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,240

officials and people seeking financial

360
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:13,720
gain would use the police to accomplish

361
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:15,319
their self-serving goals Papa said at a

362
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:17,519

364
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:21,720
court the suit alleges that podo and

365
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,800
other city employees favored certain

366
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:25,560
dispensaries over others the city of

367
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:27,958
Santa Ana used a lottery system to

368
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:30,239
select 20 pot shops to operate legally

369
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:32,479
under a new voter approved plan the

370
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:35,839
lawsuit alleges that at least one

371
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:37,440
dispensary which paid PLO was selected

372
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,880
so this dispensary paid for their

373
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,399
[ __ ] spot in the lottery which is

374
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:43,120
shitty and this dude allegedly allegedly

375
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:45,078
I have to use the word allegedly this

376
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,839
dude allegedly took the damn

377
00:13:45,078 --> 00:13:49,278
money the article goes on Skyhigh

378
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:51,120
holistic did not win a spot in the

379
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:52,958
lottery and its patients alleged that

380
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,759
because PLO and other city employees had

381
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:56,838
Financial ties with competing marijuana

382
00:13:54,759 --> 00:13:58,879
dispensaries they Ed their positions to

383
00:13:56,839 --> 00:14:00,880
close down the competition including

384
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:03,519
including shutting down power and water

385
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:05,399
surfaces the suit said Pap has released

386
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,078
an edited surveillance video last week

387
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:08,919
showing what the lawsuit describes as

388
00:14:07,078 --> 00:14:10,919
excessive and unreasonable actions by

389
00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:12,799
police officers during the raid and I

390
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:14,120
will agree with both of those statements

391
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:16,479
excessive and

392
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:18,278
unreasonable uh the suit said that uh

393
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,039
the suit said officers cost more than

394
00:14:18,278 --> 00:14:24,039
$100,000 to video surveillance equipment

395
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:25,799
safes Furniture doors and other property

396
00:14:24,039 --> 00:14:28,240
an internal investigation by the Santa

397
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:32,120
Ana Police Department is ongoing retired

398
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:34,720
la uh LAPD deputy chief Steven Downing

399
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:36,959
echoed at echu the accusations at the

400
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,320
news conference Monday police officer

401
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:40,958
should not behave that way it was

402
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:43,360
unprofessional Downing said PLO released

403
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:45,479
the released the video statement Monday

404
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,120
afternoon in response to the lawsuit

405
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,920
these allegations are unequivocally

406
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,000
false and the city will be responding to

407
00:14:48,919 --> 00:14:53,360
this lawsuit he also said he has no

408
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,639
financial interest or stake in any

409
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,680
dispensary this article was from the

410
00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:59,000
associated the Associated Press did

411
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:02,078
contribute to this article I have to

412
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,639
mention that part at the end so they are

413
00:15:02,078 --> 00:15:07,159
suing they are going to file a lawsuit

414
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:10,000
they have filed a lawsuit against the uh

415
00:15:07,159 --> 00:15:11,559
cops that did this [ __ ] so hopefully

416
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,480
they don't get away with this hopefully

417
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:15,879
this uh sets a new standard you know

418
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:18,079
maybe this will make a

419
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:20,559
difference and we can't have cops

420
00:15:18,078 --> 00:15:21,719
raiding places and eating Edibles so

421
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:24,319
they did over a

422
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:27,440
$100,000 in damage I hope they sue these

423
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,800
guys for what like three or four times

424
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,680
that because you're going to have to fix

425
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:31,240
it and then you're going to have to

426
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:33,519
recoup your losses you're going to have

427
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:35,079
to uh catch up from all the business

428
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:36,399
that you missed yeah I hope they sue

429
00:15:35,078 --> 00:15:39,239
them for at least three or four times

430
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:41,519
this part all right I'm going to move on

431
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:43,079
to another news article here which one

432
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:45,759
is

433
00:15:43,078 --> 00:15:49,000
next all right here we go this one is

434
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:52,000
from oh right here at home the peblo

435
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,879
chieftain this one says uh Colorado

436
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,440
workers can be fired for using pot off

437
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:58,919
duty uh this article is from Denver it's

438
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,839
written by Kristen Wyatt of the

439
00:15:58,919 --> 00:16:02,599
Associated Press it says pot may be

440
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:04,319
legal in Colorado but you can still be

441
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,278
fired for using it the state Supreme

442
00:16:04,318 --> 00:16:07,919
Court ruled 5 to1 Monday that a medical

443
00:16:06,278 --> 00:16:09,879
marijuana patient who was fired for

444
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:11,879
failing a drug test cannot get his job

445
00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:13,879
back the case was being watched closely

446
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:15,318
by employers and pot smokers in states

447
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:17,639
that have legalized medical or

448
00:16:15,318 --> 00:16:18,958
recreational marijuana Colorado became

449
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:20,720
the fourth state in which courts have

450
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:22,758
ruled against medical marijuana patients

451
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,040
fired for pot use Supreme Courts in

452
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:27,360
California Montana and Washington State

453
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:29,278
have made similar rulings uh so I'm

454
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,039
going to jump in here for a minute this

455
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:33,480
uh this article kind of frustrated a lot

456
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:35,719
of people but honestly nothing has

457
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:37,360
changed with this new ruling Colorado

458
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:39,519
has always been an at will state which

459
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,440
means you can be fired for anything or

460
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,919
nothing you don't have to be given a

461
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,040
reason your boss can walk up and say

462
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:46,278
guess what you're fired by here's your

463
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:48,559
last paycheck so at any minute you can

464
00:16:46,278 --> 00:16:52,000
be fired for no reason it's an at will

465
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:55,399
state uh so even if they did find

466
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,759
Cannabis in your

467
00:16:55,399 --> 00:16:59,039
system and it was legal they could still

468
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:01,039
fire you if they wanted to they could

469
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:02,439
just say haha you're fired but all right

470
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:04,119
let me get back into the article where

471
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,720
the hell was I now all right the

472
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:07,198
Colorado worker Brandon coats is a

473
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:09,038
quadriplegic who was fired by Dish

474
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:11,519
Network after failing failing a drug

475
00:17:09,038 --> 00:17:13,240
test in 2010 the company agreed that

476
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:15,359
coats wasn't high on the job but they

477
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:17,640
said they have a zero tolerance drug

478
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:19,399
policy coats argued that his pot smoking

479
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:21,199
was allowed under state law intended to

480
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,240
protect employees from being fired for

481
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:25,120
legal activities off the clock coats

482
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:28,120
didn't use marijuana at work but pots

483
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:30,119
intoxicating chemical THC holy crap

484
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:32,479
excuse excuse me uh pots intoxicating

485
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:34,000
chemical THC can stay in the system for

486
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,038
weeks and once again these guys used

487
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,599
chemical I don't think the word chemical

488
00:17:36,038 --> 00:17:39,480
is appropriate there but we'll just let

489
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:41,439
them do their thing they are

490
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:43,440
professionals he I'm going to go on with

491
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,960
the article the Colorado Justice ruled

492
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,679
that because marijuana is illegal under

493
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,720
federal law coat's use of the drug

494
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:50,640
couldn't be considered legal off-duty

495
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,839
activity there's no exception for

496
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,600
marijuana use for medicinal purposes or

497
00:17:52,839 --> 00:17:56,158
for marijuana use conducted in

498
00:17:54,599 --> 00:17:58,279
accordance with state law the court

499
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:59,720
wrote coats and his lawyers said after

500
00:17:58,279 --> 00:18:02,119
the the ruling that the decision at

501
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:04,200
least clarified the matters for workers

502
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:06,519
although I'm very disappointed today I

503
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:08,720
hope that my case has brought the issue

504
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:11,038
of use of medical marijuana and

505

that [ __ ] all right so this article

575
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:31,279
comes from the cannabis it is written by

576
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:32,678
of course it's written by our good

577
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:35,918
friend Ricardo

578
00:20:32,679 --> 00:20:38,120
Baka and uh it got my attention because

579
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:40,880
it says Oregon police compare piles of

580
00:20:38,119 --> 00:20:43,158
weed to a voodoo donut as visual aid and

581
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:45,080
they actually do this it says if you're

582
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:47,159
in Oregon and passionate about marijuana

583
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:50,038

586
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,519
in Oregon the shops won't be open just

587
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,000
yet that comes in the fall officials

588
00:20:56,519 --> 00:21:01,000
think but July 1st will represent to

589
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,279
many the beginning of a new era in the

590
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,839
Pacific Northwest state but how much

591

592
00:21:04,839 --> 00:21:09,439

buds at home and up to 1 ounce outside

597
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:23,240
of the home but especially since weed is

598
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:25,679
coming out of a very dark grow Closet in

599

little uh frame here I'm trying to read

605
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,360
it right though and perhaps they don't

606
00:21:36,919 --> 00:21:40,000
have a laboratory grade digitally

607
00:21:38,359 --> 00:21:41,278
calibrated scale in their desk drawer

608

Colorado everyone's got a Digi scale now

611
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,559
offici afficionados the Portland police

612
00:21:47,319 --> 00:21:49,918
are here to help in a very

613
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:51,759
straightforward and almost sweetly

614
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:53,520
maternal Blog the department encourages

615
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:55,720
community members to be responsible and

616
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:57,480
considerate with recreational marijuana

617
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:59,519
they tell people that stone driving is a

618
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:01,240
crime public consumption could result in

619
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:03,079
a citation and bringing Washington

620
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:05,720
bought weed into Oregon is a federal no

621
00:22:03,079 --> 00:22:07,439
no uh with that last note being a bit of

622
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,839
a turnaround from the Department's

623
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,558
previous statements so they must have

624
00:22:08,839 --> 00:22:13,000
went back on something they said earlier

625
00:22:10,558 --> 00:22:14,639
we'll have to research that so the best

626
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,839
part of the Portland Police memo the

627
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,720
visual aid that compares a pile of weed

628
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:21,319
to a voodoo donut one of the state's

629
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,400
most celebrated Edibles which is not of

630
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:25,079
course is not infused it's one of the

631
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,559
most popular snacks in Portland if you

632
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:29,240
ever go there you have to have a voodoo

633
00:22:26,558 --> 00:22:30,558
donut it is defitely super popular all

634
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,720
my friends in Portland always talk about

635
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:34,519
it I hate you guys that are eating them

636
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:36,000
right now send me one anyway so it says

637
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:37,319
so how much weed makes up an ounce the

638
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,278
legal amount you'll be able to have on

639
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:41,519
your person in Oregon about the size of

640
00:22:39,278 --> 00:22:43,278
a doughnut if not a little bigger so

641
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:46,158
imagine that you guys in Oregon you're

642
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:47,720
allowed to have a dut pile sized amount

643
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:49,320
of weed so if you get pulled over by the

644
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,679
cops and you got some weed on you

645
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:52,439
they're like how much weed you got and

646
00:22:50,679 --> 00:22:54,880
you're like this much is that cop going

647
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:56,440
to go to his car and pull out his donut

648
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,000
and [ __ ] set the donuts cuz you know

649
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:59,720
the cop's got a donut in the car is he

650
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,319
going to go get a dut and set that donut

651
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:03,200
down and set it next to your herb and be

652
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:05,399
like E I think you're cool bro you can

653
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,960
get away with that that's going to be

654
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,519
[ __ ] funny all right and then it says

655
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,038
what about 8 ounces the legal amount

656
00:23:08,519 --> 00:23:12,839
you're able to have uh at home in Oregon

657
00:23:11,038 --> 00:23:15,919
about the size of a pile of donuts it

658
00:23:12,839 --> 00:23:17,798
doesn't completely dwarf the dut uh he'd

659
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:19,320
be able to climb oh he'd be able to

660
00:23:17,798 --> 00:23:21,679
climb that pile of weed if he could

661
00:23:19,319 --> 00:23:23,079
climb so you'd have eight Donuts worth

662
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:24,759
of weed right if you could have 8 ounces

663
00:23:23,079 --> 00:23:26,678
you'd have about eight Donuts so you'd

664
00:23:24,759 --> 00:23:28,960
have a dozen donuts plus two extra worth

665
00:23:26,679 --> 00:23:30,120
of weed so just visualize that next time

666
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,759
you want to know how much weed you can

667
00:23:30,119 --> 00:23:34,678
carry around in Portland this is weird

668
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:36,440
all right the article goes on to say

669
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:37,840
it's a genius Ploy on the police's part

670
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:39,320
and the inclusion of donuts inside

671
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:41,079
Official Police marketing material

672
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:43,319
surely isn't lost on anyone checking out

673
00:23:41,079 --> 00:23:45,119
the truly modern graphic it takes us

674
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:47,558
back in fact to Wi Denver's police had

675
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:49,319
some 420 friendly fun on their own when

676
00:23:47,558 --> 00:23:50,798
they dropped a smart hipop reference on

677
00:23:49,319 --> 00:23:53,158
their official Twitter account on this

678
00:23:50,798 --> 00:23:55,639
last 420 weekend and I think I remember

679
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:57,000
that they said uh we see you rolling and

680
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:58,200
we ain't hating but then they talked

681
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,200
about all the rules that you had to

682
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:02,400
follow to uh smoke weed in Colorado all

683
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,038
right so the article goes on to say

684
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,400
Portland and Denver will share more than

685
00:24:04,038 --> 00:24:08,720
just legal weed on July 1st in December

686
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:11,600
2013 the city's beloved Voodoo Donuts

687
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:13,640
open its first shop outside of Oregon in

688
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:15,079
Denver of course so the next time I'm in

689
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:17,080
Denver I'm definitely going to go grab

690
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:18,639

691
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:20,639

717
00:25:08,599 --> 00:25:12,398
