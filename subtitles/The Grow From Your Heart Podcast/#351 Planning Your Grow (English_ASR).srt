24
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:55,259
today I have been talking about doing a

25
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:57,149
series of episodes that run my listeners

26
00:00:55,259 --> 00:00:59,460
from the very beginning of a grow all

27
00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:01,198
the way to the very end of a grow I want

28
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,420
to talk about selecting your growth

29
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:05,250
space I want to talk about sprouting

30
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,719
seeds and cutting clones all the way

31
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,400
through the veg phase all the way to

32
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:09,719
flower all the way up to harvest and

33
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,430
then we'll talk about drying and curing

34
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:13,950
once again I want to go from beginning

35
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:16,140
to end I'm gonna do a long series of

36
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:19,409
detailed episodes and this will be the

37
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:21,390
first episode in that series in this

38
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:22,950
episode we're gonna talk about planning

39
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,780

40
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:27,270
goals for your garden and it will also

41
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:28,890
give you a few tips on how to stay out

42
00:01:27,269 --> 00:01:31,769
of trouble and avoid common mistakes

43
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:33,868
people make when setting up a new grow

44
00:01:31,769 --> 00:01:35,640
so now that I've got a solid intro laid

45
00:01:33,868 --> 00:01:37,140
down I'm gonna press pause I'm gonna

46
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,030
take a couple of dabs while you grab a

47
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,489
notebook and when we get back we're

48
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:43,920
gonna talk about planning your cannabis

49
00:01:41,489 --> 00:01:45,780
garden all right podcast rolled I am

50
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,790
back I am well medicated I am well

51
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,829
hydrated I hope you grabbed a pen and

52
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:52,500
some paper because there will be a lot

53
00:01:49,828 --> 00:01:55,379
of information in this episode let's get

54
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:57,090
into planning your new garden before we

55
00:01:55,379 --> 00:01:58,920
start shopping for lights and seeds and

56
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:01,170
planning for your first harvest there

57
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:04,349
are a few things you can do to make your

58
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:06,359
growing experience more enjoyable the

59
00:02:04,349 --> 00:02:08,189
first piece of advice I have for anybody

60
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:11,219
who is planning to start a new grow is

61
00:02:08,189 --> 00:02:13,530
to buy grow books from reputable grow

62
00:02:11,219 --> 00:02:16,409
authors authors I can recommend

63
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:19,289
Edie Rosenthal or his servantes Greg

64
00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:21,810
green Robert Connell Clarke Andrew West

65
00:02:19,289 --> 00:02:24,000
now the second piece of advice is to

66
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:26,969
open those books and read them I

67
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,800
recommend you read the whole book before

68
00:02:26,969 --> 00:02:32,129
you start growing that way you know what

69
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,110
to expect before problems arise that way

70
00:02:32,129 --> 00:02:35,400
if a problem does pop up you know what

71
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:35,819
you've got because you've seen it in the

72
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,650
book

73
00:02:35,818 --> 00:02:39,179
you know how to diagnose it you know how

74
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:41,430
to treat it that way you don't make the

75
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,170
problem worse by diagnosing the problem

76
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:45,420
under pressure and making the wrong

77
00:02:43,169 --> 00:02:48,359
decision so get yourself a grow book

78
00:02:45,419 --> 00:02:51,268
from a reputable grower and read that

79
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:54,120
book once again I like and rosenthal or

80
00:02:51,269 --> 00:02:56,670
his servantes Greg green Robert Connell

81
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:59,099
Clarke drew West there are a ton of

82
00:02:56,669 --> 00:03:00,689
great cannabis authors out there reading

83
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:02,459
books will give you an idea of what to

84
00:03:00,689 --> 00:03:04,650
expect and you'll have an eye for things

85
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:07,800
when they pop up you won't have as many

86
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:10,500
surprises you can find books from most

87
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:12,660
of the authors I listed on Amazon you

88
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:15,139
can also find a lot of great free PDF

89
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:17,370
files if you do a quick Google search

90
00:03:15,139 --> 00:03:19,708
another great way to increase your

91
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:22,230
cannabis knowledge is by listening to

92
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:24,599
cannabis podcasts if you're a new grower

93
00:03:22,229 --> 00:03:27,000
I recommend shows like the dude grows

94
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:29,639
and free weed if you're in advanced

95
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,739
grower I recommend shows like cannabis

96
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:34,529
cultivation and Sciences and shaping

97
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:37,829
fire another great way to learn about

98
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:40,349
cannabis is through YouTube there are a

99
00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:42,180
lot of great cannabis YouTube channels

100
00:03:40,349 --> 00:03:45,900
out there but you don't have to watch

101
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:47,670
cannabis specific videos to learn about

102
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:49,859
growing you can watch basic plant

103
00:03:47,669 --> 00:03:52,169
biology and basic horticulture videos

104
00:03:49,859 --> 00:03:54,299
and most of that is going to apply to

105
00:03:52,169 --> 00:03:55,589
your cannabis garden so learn about the

106
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:57,689
plants learn about the way that they

107
00:03:55,590 --> 00:04:00,900
function and learn why they do what they

108
00:03:57,689 --> 00:04:03,209
do through those YouTube videos one

109
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:05,789
thing I would avoid is cannabis forums

110
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:07,500
there is a lot of crap in cannabis

111
00:04:05,789 --> 00:04:09,419
forums that's part of why I started this

112
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:11,909
show I saw people giving terrible advice

113
00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:14,399
on cannabis forums and I wanted to come

114
00:04:11,909 --> 00:04:15,750
on here and correct that so be really

115
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,389
careful if you're taking advice from

116
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:20,750
cannabis forums I would recommend you

117
00:04:18,389 --> 00:04:24,839
avoid them completely and stick with

118
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:26,610
books podcasts and YouTube channels from

119
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:28,560
reputable growers

120
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:30,419
so my first piece of advice is to buy

121
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,759
and read grow books from reputable

122
00:04:30,418 --> 00:04:35,810
growers then supplement that education

123
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:38,580
with knowledge from YouTube and podcasts

124
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:40,530
now before we go too much further with

125
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:42,810
our plans to grow we've got some things

126
00:04:40,529 --> 00:04:45,929
to consider an important thing to think

127
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:48,598
about is legality is it legal to grow

128
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:50,879
where you're planning to set up if it is

129
00:04:48,598 --> 00:04:53,878
illegal I can't recommend you grow there

130
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:56,968
I've got to tell you to obey the laws if

131
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:59,639
you do choose to grow in an illegal area

132
00:04:56,968 --> 00:05:01,468
keep in mind you are now committing a

133
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:04,379
crime that could result in a

134
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:08,069
life-changing experience for you your

135
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:09,960
family and everyone in that household if

136
00:05:08,069 --> 00:05:12,810
you are suspected of running an illegal

137
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:15,779
grow in your home the police possibly

138
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:18,028
the SWAT team possibly the DEA will kick

139
00:05:15,779 --> 00:05:20,068
in your door and drag you and your

140
00:05:18,028 --> 00:05:22,228
family into your front lawn and your

141
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:25,979
underwear while they destroy your entire

142
00:05:22,228 --> 00:05:28,110
house they go through everything they

143
00:05:25,978 --> 00:05:30,269
will take all of your money they'll take

144
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:32,610
your firearms if you have any they will

145
00:05:30,269 --> 00:05:35,878
probably shoot your dog they may shoot

146
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:38,129
you if your family is home they will be

147
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:40,400
detained and possibly shot if they don't

148
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:44,338
react properly to police instructions

149
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:47,158
your house is now a drug house they come

150
00:05:44,338 --> 00:05:49,228
in ready for war your wife and kids will

151
00:05:47,158 --> 00:05:51,750
never forget the morning the door came

152
00:05:49,228 --> 00:05:53,908
off and armed men came in and took you

153
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:57,360
to jail and destroyed the house your

154
00:05:53,908 --> 00:05:59,550
life will never be the same think about

155
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,770
this before you choose to set up I know

156
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:03,658
that sounds dramatic it is dramatic and

157
00:06:01,769 --> 00:06:05,908
it will be traumatic for you and

158
00:06:03,658 --> 00:06:09,120
everyone involved I can't stress this

159
00:06:05,908 --> 00:06:11,310
enough think about this before you hang

160
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,699
up your grow lights think about this

161
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:16,379
before you order your seeds also keep in

162
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:19,588
mind that you are producing a high-value

163
00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:21,360
product start thinking now about what

164
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:23,550
you're going to do if somebody tries to

165
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,860
come in your home and take that from you

166
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:28,050
while you are there think about it now

167
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:31,050
so that you know what you're getting

168
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:33,120
into before the time comes now that I've

169
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:36,778
made that important disclaimer let's

170
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,218
move forward let's think about why you

171
00:06:36,778 --> 00:06:40,560
are growing are you going to supply

172
00:06:38,218 --> 00:06:42,389
yourself are you going to supply is sick

173
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,160
remember are you trying to be the next

174
00:06:42,389 --> 00:06:47,340
neighborhood hookup are you trying to be

175
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,560
the next Pablo Escobar of cannabis think

176
00:06:47,339 --> 00:06:52,739
about the real reason for your grow and

177
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:54,899
have a goal in mind if your goal is to

178
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:57,810
supply yourself think about how much

179
00:06:54,899 --> 00:07:00,388
product you need every 60 to 90 days and

180
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:02,910
set up a grow that will supply that for

181
00:07:00,389 --> 00:07:05,069
yourself plus maybe a little extra in

182
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:08,370
case you have an issue or a delay in

183
00:07:05,069 --> 00:07:10,050
your next cycle growing enough product

184
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:12,329
to supply yourself should be an easy

185
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:13,919
goal growing enough to supply the whole

186
00:07:12,329 --> 00:07:16,019
neighborhood is when it starts to get

187
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:18,359
risky every time you hang up another

188
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:21,120
light you increase your chances of

189
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:23,129
trouble exponentially in my opinion so

190
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,918
think about the risks involved before

191
00:07:23,129 --> 00:07:28,019
you expand and I always recommend

192
00:07:24,918 --> 00:07:31,109
starting small learning how to grow and

193
00:07:28,019 --> 00:07:33,029
then expand from there so think about

194
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:36,210
what you realistically expect from your

195
00:07:33,029 --> 00:07:38,159
grow and set a goal for yourself your

196
00:07:36,209 --> 00:07:39,989
grow is going to be limited by the

197
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,150
amount of space you have the amount of

198
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:44,430
equipment you have and also the amount

199
00:07:42,149 --> 00:07:47,339
of electricity you can provide to that

200
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:49,918
space one of your goals is to figure out

201
00:07:47,339 --> 00:07:52,099
how to maximize the yield from the

202
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:54,870
amount of space you have got a

203
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:57,450
reasonable goal is one pound per

204
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:59,788
thousand watt light and a thousand watt

205
00:07:57,449 --> 00:08:02,519
light usually is good for about a four

206
00:07:59,788 --> 00:08:05,159
by four to a five by five space so you

207
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:07,949
would expect about one pound per every

208
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:10,620
four by four or five by five foot space

209
00:08:07,949 --> 00:08:12,478
now don't expect that right away you've

210
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:14,069
got to learn how to grow you've got to

211
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:15,779
learn the genetics you've got to learn

212
00:08:14,069 --> 00:08:17,699
your nutrients and you've got to dial in

213
00:08:15,779 --> 00:08:19,709
the room but to give you guys an

214
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:21,360
estimate and help you design and set up

215
00:08:19,709 --> 00:08:24,870
your room and understand how to reach

216
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:27,240
your goals you can reasonably expect one

217
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:28,978
pound per thousand watt light once you

218
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,418
get good at growing now once you really

219
00:08:28,978 --> 00:08:32,729
get good at growing you should increase

220
00:08:30,418 --> 00:08:34,139
that goal to closer to two pounds per

221
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:36,150
light and if you move into the

222
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:37,949
double-ended bulb technology you can

223
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:40,559
certainly increase your expectations

224
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:41,969
much more with more lighting of course

225
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,168
all of what I'm talking about is with

226
00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:45,270
high pressure sodium lighting

227
00:08:43,168 --> 00:08:47,909
high-intensity discharge lighting I do

228
00:08:45,269 --> 00:08:50,669
not have enough experience with LEDs to

229
00:08:47,909 --> 00:08:52,559
give you any estimates or expectations

230
00:08:50,669 --> 00:08:54,129
and again this is all just rough

231
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:56,229
expectations rough guess

232
00:08:54,129 --> 00:08:58,389
it's about a pound per thousand watt

233
00:08:56,230 --> 00:09:01,120
light is your general goal once you

234
00:08:58,389 --> 00:09:02,669
learn how to grow don't focus too much

235
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,919
on yields when you're getting started

236
00:09:02,669 --> 00:09:07,839
focus more on learning the needs of the

237
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:09,909
plant understanding the cycles of the

238
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:11,740
plant and learning how to see what the

239
00:09:09,909 --> 00:09:13,419
plants are telling you focus more on

240
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:15,519
that when you get started then the

241
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:17,500
yields will come the quality will come

242
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,689
when you develop a relationship with the

243
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:21,340
plant everything will fall into place so

244
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:23,230
learn how to grow I'm just giving you a

245
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:26,259
rough idea of what you can expect once

246
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:28,120
you get dialed in now let's get back on

247
00:09:26,259 --> 00:09:30,370
track with things we need to think about

248
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,870
when planning our a grow the next thing

249
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:33,879
I've got written down is safety and

250
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:36,190
security we're gonna talk about that in

251
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:38,080
detail in the next episode which is

252
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:39,940
going to be selecting and planning your

253
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,100
space this is going to be overall

254
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:44,560
planning your grow the next episode will

255
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:45,850
focus more in on your space so for

256
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:48,039
safety and security we're gonna go

257
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:50,200
quickly you need to worry about the law

258
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:51,399
I already talked in depth about that you

259
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,930
need to worry about thieves and

260
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:55,090
criminals I already talked a little bit

261
00:09:52,929 --> 00:09:57,219
about that so safety and security will

262
00:09:55,090 --> 00:10:00,370
be discussed more in the next episode

263
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:03,070
another thing I've got is water is water

264
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:06,100
accessible and affordable where you plan

265
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:09,100
to grow also do you have an excuse for

266
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:11,350
the extra water consumption the next

267
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:13,330
thing on the list is electricity when

268
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:15,970
you're planning your grow keep in mind

269
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:18,730
that you will be very limited by the

270
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:21,430
amount of electricity you can pull from

271
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:23,259
a home most homes have a one or two

272
00:10:21,429 --> 00:10:25,479
hundred amp service depending on your

273
00:10:23,259 --> 00:10:28,179
location if you've only got a hundred

274
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:29,560
amp service you will be very limited on

275
00:10:28,179 --> 00:10:31,329
how many lights you can run if you've

276
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:33,879
got two hundred amps of service you'll

277
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:35,470
still be limited in my experience when

278
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:37,299
they put the electricity in your house

279
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:40,540
they did not consider you adding

280
00:10:37,299 --> 00:10:42,279
thousand watt grow lights they put just

281
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:43,929
enough for you to run all of the

282
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:46,089
appliances and things in your house and

283
00:10:43,929 --> 00:10:47,529
also plug in the blow dryer and the

284
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:49,480
microwave they don't give you a lot of

285
00:10:47,529 --> 00:10:51,490
extra amperage because they never

286
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:54,430
thought you were going to plug in these

287
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:56,049
high-powered devices so you're going to

288
00:10:54,429 --> 00:10:59,349
be limited by the amount of electricity

289
00:10:56,049 --> 00:11:02,259
before you go out and buy 4,000 watt

290
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:04,210
lights maybe buy 2 and plug them both in

291
00:11:02,259 --> 00:11:06,759
and see if you start flipping breakers

292
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:08,230
I'm sure you won't be able to plug in to

293
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:11,019
1,000 watt light

294
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:12,879
into the same receptacle in one room

295
00:11:11,019 --> 00:11:14,350
that little plug-in right there it's got

296
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:16,000
the plug-in on top to plug in on the

297
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:17,259
bottom you got your phone plugged into

298
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,809
one you got the computer plugged into

299
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:21,639
the other you cannot plug in two 1000

300
00:11:19,809 --> 00:11:23,349
watt lights into that that will flip the

301
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:24,669
breaker you're gonna run out to the

302
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,750
garage or wherever you're gonna flip the

303
00:11:24,669 --> 00:11:27,459
breaker you're gonna make it come on

304
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:28,809
again it's gonna start heating up the

305
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:31,420
receptacle it's gonna blow the

306
00:11:28,809 --> 00:11:34,539
receptacle or it's gonna catch the wires

307
00:11:31,419 --> 00:11:36,939
on fire don't try to plug in 2000 watt

308
00:11:34,539 --> 00:11:39,250
lights into the same plug in you might

309
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:41,350
not even be able to run to 1000 watt

310
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:44,049
lights in the same room if both of the

311
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:46,120
plugins are on the same breaker most of

312
00:11:44,049 --> 00:11:50,559
the breakers in your house are going to

313
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:52,629
be 10 amps maybe 20 amps and maybe 35

314
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:54,429
amps if you're really lucky older homes

315
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:56,649
are gonna have tens and twenties more

316
00:11:54,429 --> 00:11:59,409
modern homes you may have up to 35 amp

317
00:11:56,649 --> 00:12:02,590
breakers most of our thousand watt grow

318
00:11:59,409 --> 00:12:04,719
lights pool about 8 to 11 amps when they

319
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:06,460
fire up they want to pull 11 amps to get

320
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,100
started as they're running they'll drop

321
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:10,570
down to around 7 or 8 amps so you have

322
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:12,610
to keep that in mind when you're

323
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:15,280
designing and thinking about your grow

324
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:17,919
how much amperage is available in the

325
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:19,539
space in which you plan to grow and

326
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:20,649
don't expect to run a bunch of extension

327
00:12:19,539 --> 00:12:21,789
cords because they're gonna get hot

328
00:12:20,649 --> 00:12:22,990
they're gonna melt they're gonna catch

329
00:12:21,789 --> 00:12:24,849
on fire they're gonna start flipping

330
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:26,830
breakers that's going to cause more

331
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:28,899
problems just realize that you either

332
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:31,600
need to upgrade the electrical or you

333
00:12:28,899 --> 00:12:33,399
need to settle for less lights also keep

334
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,220
in mind that for every light you hang

335
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:38,230
you probably need a blower or a fan or

336
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:41,379
some sort of electricity's so allow

337
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:42,820
extra amperage for your accessories and

338
00:12:41,379 --> 00:12:44,289
you've also got to run the house you

339
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:46,060
have to turn on lights in the

340
00:12:44,289 --> 00:12:47,589
refrigerator and what if somebody tries

341
00:12:46,059 --> 00:12:49,329
to run the microwave and it blows up the

342
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:52,629
whole grow keep that sort of stuff in

343
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:54,520
mind don't burn down the house with your

344
00:12:52,629 --> 00:12:56,950
grow so we'll talk more about

345
00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:59,980
electricity and the selecting your space

346
00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:01,540
episode as well also airflow you're

347
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:04,330
gonna need air flow we will talk in

348
00:13:01,539 --> 00:13:08,439
depth about air flow in the next episode

349
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:11,080
trash you guys people don't consider how

350
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:13,900
much trash they will create when they

351
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:16,330
are building and running a grow you're

352
00:13:13,899 --> 00:13:18,340
gonna have boxes that say high pressure

353
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:19,810
sodium grow light on them you're gonna

354
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:22,149
have to think about how to get rid of

355
00:13:19,809 --> 00:13:23,589
that discreetly you'll have empty

356
00:13:22,149 --> 00:13:26,049
nutrient bottles that you need to figure

357
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:27,639
out how to get rid of discreetly then

358
00:13:26,049 --> 00:13:29,379
when we harvest we've got to figure out

359
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:31,689
how to get rid of that old root ball all

360
00:13:29,379 --> 00:13:32,919
of the sticks and all of that dirt so

361
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:35,290
that's something to start thinking about

362
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:37,779
before we start buying grow lights and

363
00:13:35,289 --> 00:13:40,419
buying our seeds another thing to think

364
00:13:37,779 --> 00:13:42,519
about is the odor and aroma of your grow

365
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:45,610
you don't want to snitch on yourself by

366
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:48,009
having a stinky garden if you do a good

367
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:49,659
job your plants are going to stink you

368
00:13:48,009 --> 00:13:52,389
will need some sort of carbon filtration

369
00:13:49,659 --> 00:13:55,750
to prevent the whole neighborhood from

370
00:13:52,389 --> 00:13:57,490
smelling your a grow something a lot of

371
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:59,559
people don't think about is when you

372
00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:01,539
start cutting down your first grow it

373
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:02,709
really stinks when you start chopping

374
00:14:01,539 --> 00:14:05,259
into those plants you start breaking

375
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:06,670
open the turps that's when it really

376
00:14:05,259 --> 00:14:09,519
stinks if you thought it smelled good

377
00:14:06,669 --> 00:14:11,409
around week 6 7 &amp; 8 wait till you cut

378
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:13,329
them down and you start chopping into

379
00:14:11,409 --> 00:14:16,299
him that's when it's really gonna stink

380
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:18,670
so be prepared for that harvest stink

381
00:14:16,299 --> 00:14:20,500
also at harvest time you've got to think

382
00:14:18,669 --> 00:14:23,019
about that trash you've got to think

383
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:25,299
about all that soil and then you've got

384
00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:28,629
a lot of herb to learn how to dry and

385
00:14:25,299 --> 00:14:30,339
cure and store how are you going to dry

386
00:14:28,629 --> 00:14:32,169
it how are you going to cure it you have

387
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:34,210
space for that where are you going to

388
00:14:32,169 --> 00:14:35,740
store it do you have space for that so

389
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:38,620
those are things to start thinking about

390
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:42,460
before you hang up any lights and buy

391
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:43,600
any seeds now here is a huge thing to

392
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:45,879
think about when you're planning your

393
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,519
grow what kind of nutrients are you

394
00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:50,950
going to use are you going to go organic

395
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:53,049
or are you going to go synthetic are you

396
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:55,990
gonna go a living soil or are you gonna

397
00:14:53,049 --> 00:14:58,719
go Coco are you gonna do no-till or are

398
00:14:55,990 --> 00:15:00,759
you gonna do hydro all of that stuff is

399
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:04,029
up to you you've got a lot of decisions

400
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:06,490
to make everything has its advantage and

401
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:08,860
everything has its disadvantage through

402
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:11,440
this long series of episodes I will try

403
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:14,500
to go over the pros and cons of organic

404
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:16,960
and synthetic of hydro and soil I'll

405
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:19,570
talk about cocoa I'll talk about dirt I

406
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:21,730
will try to talk about all of that stuff

407
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:23,560
and help you make those decisions but

408
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:25,899
now's the time to start thinking about

409
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:28,269
it do you want to go organic do you want

410
00:15:25,899 --> 00:15:31,059
to go synthetic along with that decision

411
00:15:28,269 --> 00:15:33,610
comes pest control integrated pest

412
00:15:31,059 --> 00:15:35,859
management do you want to apply spray

413
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:38,409
applications of pesticides do you

414
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:40,120
want to use predator bugs all of these

415
00:15:38,409 --> 00:15:42,309
options have their pros and cons and

416
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:45,399
they're all up to you you'll need to

417
00:15:42,309 --> 00:15:47,679
find a pest management system that also

418
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:49,659
works with your nutrient system if

419
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:51,278
you're running a full organic system you

420
00:15:49,659 --> 00:15:53,828
don't want to go in there and apply a

421
00:15:51,278 --> 00:15:55,179
toxic pesticide that could disrupt the

422
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:57,879
environment you've spent so much time

423
00:15:55,179 --> 00:16:00,309
creating so one of your major things to

424
00:15:57,879 --> 00:16:02,769
think about will be your medium do you

425
00:16:00,309 --> 00:16:04,838
want to run soil soilless mix coco

426
00:16:02,769 --> 00:16:05,470
perlite do you want to run rock wool

427
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:08,170
cubes

428
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:10,269
it is all up to you along with that

429
00:16:08,169 --> 00:16:11,889
decision you get to decide what you're

430
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:13,570
going to feed those plants do you want

431
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:15,220
to go all organic do you want to go full

432
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:17,019
synthetics do you want to do a combo

433
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:19,389
that is up to you

434
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:22,120
then another major part of that decision

435
00:16:19,389 --> 00:16:24,789
is how you are going to prevent pests it

436
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:26,620
will all work together your medium your

437
00:16:24,789 --> 00:16:29,919
nutrients and your integrated pest

438
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:32,139
management will all become one big unit

439
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:34,929
so think about that in-depth before you

440
00:16:32,139 --> 00:16:36,850
make any decisions and again as this

441
00:16:34,929 --> 00:16:39,458
series continues I will do a lot of

442
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:41,139
discussions on most of those topics and

443
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:43,899
try to guide you and I will try to

444
00:16:41,139 --> 00:16:45,909
remain unbiased I will talk about how I

445
00:16:43,899 --> 00:16:48,759
grow and I will also try to give you

446
00:16:45,909 --> 00:16:51,759
unbiased information on other options

447
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:53,819
and other methods that will work just as

448
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:55,929
well as the way I have chosen to grow

449
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:57,940
you guys that's part of the beauty of

450
00:16:55,929 --> 00:16:59,469
setting up your own grow nobody can tell

451
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:01,089
you what to do there's no right or wrong

452
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:03,278
way the wrong way is when your plants

453
00:17:01,089 --> 00:17:04,900
die the right way is when you were happy

454
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:07,240
and you're getting what you want out of

455
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:10,240
it grow if it's producing the quality

456
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:12,068
the amount and you're satisfied you're

457
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,990
doing it correctly you could probably

458
00:17:12,068 --> 00:17:15,428
improve a little bit but you're doing it

459
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:17,140
right and nobody can tell you you're

460
00:17:15,429 --> 00:17:18,970
doing it wrong if you're happy with it

461
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:20,709
it's your grow like I said you're doing

462
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:22,929
it wrong when the plants die or when you

463
00:17:20,709 --> 00:17:25,298
get a bunch of bugs but it's your grow

464
00:17:22,929 --> 00:17:27,910
make yourself happy now once you put a

465
00:17:25,298 --> 00:17:30,668
lot of thought into your medium your

466
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:33,429
nutrients your pest control and if you

467
00:17:30,669 --> 00:17:34,929
want to go organic or synthetic a few

468
00:17:33,429 --> 00:17:37,720
more things you should think about are

469
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:40,150
do you want to grow from seed or from

470
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:42,539
clone I will do in depth episodes in the

471
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:45,130
very near future on the advantages and

472
00:17:42,539 --> 00:17:46,839
disadvantages of starting from seed or

473
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:49,090
clone and then I will also talk about

474
00:17:46,839 --> 00:17:49,750
how to sprout seeds and we'll also do

475
00:17:49,089 --> 00:17:52,179
episodes on

476
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:54,190
cutting clones so I will go in-depth on

477
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:55,810
that subject but start thinking about

478
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:59,470
that now do you want to grow from seed

479
00:17:55,809 --> 00:18:00,789
or do you want to grow from clone so

480
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:03,490
those are a bunch of great things to

481
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:05,980
think about before you even buy a grow

482
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:08,079
light buy a grow book and read it

483
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:10,210
find more podcasts that you find

484
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:12,609
educational and entertaining and listen

485
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:14,079
to those podcasts then maybe find some

486
00:18:12,609 --> 00:18:16,929
YouTube channels to teach you about

487
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:18,429
basic Plant Sciences and watch those in

488
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:21,250
your free time and get a good

489
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:22,890
understanding of the plant then you've

490
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:26,200
got a lot of other things to think about

491
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:28,720
