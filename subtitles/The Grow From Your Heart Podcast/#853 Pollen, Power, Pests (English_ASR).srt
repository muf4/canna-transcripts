33
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:29,239

festival called skankfest many people

35
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:33,599

36
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:36,158
that's an interesting name yes I listen

37
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:38,959

38
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:41,560

them they're all there in one place

53
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:11,759
skankfest is cool because a comedian

54
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,440
will do a show on stage and you're in a

55
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:15,598

for you as quickly as possible now that

99
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:35,719
is part of why we are going to read a

100
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,360
question that involves a question about

101
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:40,239
lights and a power failure and a power

102
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:42,239
problem a lot of people are going to

103
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,319
experience power problems at this point

104
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,120
in time electricity failure if you're

105
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:48,719
near the hurricane areas your power is

106
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:50,719
going to go out uh this question kind of

107
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:52,158
got highlighted because of that is

108
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:54,239
happening now so let's work our way

109
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:56,519
right into this question this question

110
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,360
came from the growel tab on iry

111
00:03:56,519 --> 00:03:59,799
genetics.com if you go to iry

112
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,519
genetics.com

113
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:03,920
there's a row of tabs one of those tabs

114
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,599
does say grow help or grow questions

115
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:07,318
click on that tab if you send me a good

116
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:09,318
grow question and I read that question

117
00:04:07,318 --> 00:04:11,719
here on the podcast I will send you a

118
00:04:09,318 --> 00:04:14,759
coupon code for a free pack of seeds at

119
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:16,160
edirect tocom the question goes a lot

120
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:19,120
like this first of all it came from our

121
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:21,079
friend who wants to be called bad Papa

122
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,639
um okay that's an interesting name I

123
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:25,639
like that shout out to my new friend bad

124
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:27,160
Papa it says with winter coming up and

125
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:29,240
then I really big wrote over that the

126
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:31,600
word hurricanes because this is very

127
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:33,879
valid for hurricane season it says will

128
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,080
a power outage in the garden cause a lot

129
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:38,159
of problems how long can plants survive

130
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:40,359
without light when should you consider

131
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,720
using a power uh an alternative power

132
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:45,479
source and what problems could arise in

133
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,639
veg and or in flower how long could

134
00:04:45,478 --> 00:04:50,478
plants survive in low temps if perhaps

135
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:52,478
problem perhaps a power outage could

136
00:04:50,478 --> 00:04:53,719
occur this is a very good question now

137
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:55,839
what I'm going to say to the folks

138
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:57,800
experiencing these power shortages and

139
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:59,198
interruptions uh where the hurricanes

140
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:01,400
are if your power is going out and

141
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,079
coming on randomly and going out I would

142
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:04,879
just say unplug everything and just let

143
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:07,000
it stay unplugged until they get

144
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:08,639
figured out it's probably better for the

145
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,959
plants and it's definitely better for

146
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,879
your equipment your ballasts uh all of

147
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:15,279
your gear would rather just come on and

148
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:17,439
stay on or stay off then come off and on

149
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:18,839
off and on all intermittently uh with

150
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:20,879
power surges coming through the house

151
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:22,318
just unplug that let it rest the

152
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:23,800
plants should be fine if they're in

153
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:25,360
flower they're not going to get light

154
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:28,520
but they'll stay in flow they'll keep

155
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,639
flowering if they're in veg eventually

156
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:32,000
they may flip into a phase that's when I

157
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,720
would get in there with some light every

158
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,120
few hours and just wake them up it takes

159
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,880
them a little bit to fall asleep but if

160
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,120
you get in there every few hours and

161
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:39,560
give them light you can keep those

162
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,160
plants awake you can do it with very

163
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:43,519
small lights just keep them awake keep

164
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:45,000
them alive but you can keep them in veg

165
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:46,959
if you do give them a little bit of

166
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,478
light but what I'm saying is if you've

167
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:50,879
got a bunch of power interruptions just

168
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:52,318
unplug uh let that stuff rest let

169
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:53,759
all the gear rest don't let it keep

170
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:55,720
coming off and on that's more

171
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:58,000
destructive to your gear there's a lot

172
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:59,919
more stuff that I did WR down here now

173
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,800
the question did start with winter is

174
00:05:59,918 --> 00:06:04,359
coming so let's focus a little bit on

175
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,720
this winter aspect of the question uh

176
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,879
there is one part that says how long

177
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:10,639
could the plant survive in low temps if

178
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:12,478
perhaps a long power outage occurred if

179
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,598
you are able to be in that house you

180
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:15,839
personally as a person are able to be in

181
00:06:14,598 --> 00:06:17,918
that house and be safe and be

182
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:20,159
comfortable the plants are just fine

183
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:21,680
those plants can survive very very low

184
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,360
temperatures if they are healthy I don't

185
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,400
know about maybe some hydroponic plants

186
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,879
that may be a different story if you got

187
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:28,959
water in there those roots get super

188
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:31,399
cold that could be problematic for you

189
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:33,359
but these plants can't handle quite cold

190
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:34,799
temperatures um we always thought

191
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,000
certain temperatures were as low as they

192
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,038
can go but a few years ago it snowed

193
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,279
here in Colorado very early we got a

194
00:06:39,038 --> 00:06:43,000
very early snowstorm and there were some

195
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:45,198
very healthy crops that survived that

196
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,839
snow so we've seen extreme we've seen

197
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,639
snow on the plants you had to go outside

198
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:51,519
and shake the ice and snow off of the

199
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:53,560
ganja plants and they were okay so they

200
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:55,279
can survive it's kind of up to the

201
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,839
plants it's up to a lot of other factors

202
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:58,679
but they can survive very cold

203
00:06:56,839 --> 00:07:00,198
temperatures if you're in that house and

204
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,478
you're not dying those plants are

205
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:04,520
probably just fine uh so the winter is

206
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:06,079
coming something I would focus on if you

207
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:08,318
are in the South if you're near these

208
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:10,000
hurricanes I would be more concerned at

209
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,800
this point with humidity you're going to

210
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,038
want to maybe open a window I don't know

211
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,759
what you can even do but you're going to

212
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:16,318
get a lot of humidity if your grow is

213
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:18,639
trapped in the house and you don't have

214
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,240
power uh those plants even in the dark

215
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,160
will create humidity they're going to be

216
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,400
breathing they're going to be

217
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:25,000
transpiring and respiring and moisture

218
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:27,279
will be happening into the air in that

219
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,918
room uh the humidity from the pots the

220
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:32,198
leaves uh just the soil itself will be

221
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:33,120
letting off humidity so depending on the

222
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:34,520
temperature of the room and the

223
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,598
environment you may have a humidity

224
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:39,120
issue in there you may need to vent a

225
00:07:36,598 --> 00:07:40,878
fan do something uh waft out that

226
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,959
humidity somehow may be the other thing

227
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:44,280
to deal with uh let me give a quick read

228
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:45,918
make sure I cover this whole question

229
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:48,198
and then we'll send you a coupon code

230
00:07:45,918 --> 00:07:50,120
for a free pack of seeds from idirect

231
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:51,520
decom once again make sure you check

232
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,759
that spam because sometimes that's where

233
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:55,758
those coupon codes go winnner coming

234
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,840
power outage how long can they survive

235
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,800
without light they could survive uh a

236
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:02,239
very long time without light but they go

237
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,840
into flower so to prevent that uh go in

238
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,158
there every few hours with some light

239
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:07,198
and give them light even if it's an

240
00:08:05,158 --> 00:08:08,959
intense flashlight Shine the Light on

241
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,158
them and wake those plants up they will

242
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:13,918
come awake when should when should you

243
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:15,478
consider an alternative power source um

244
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:17,560
if you're in flow it'd be cool to have

245
00:08:15,478 --> 00:08:19,519
an alternative flower Source but most of

246
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:21,560
the time if it's two three maybe four

247
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:23,240
days which uh it usually doesn't go

248
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:25,319
longer than that in we're if you're in

249
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,800
the states uh most of the time except

250
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:28,439
for that one time in Texas it went

251
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,919
pretty long but most of the time you're

252
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:31,439
not going to need some sort of stuff

253
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:33,158
like that unless you're in a hurricane

254
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:34,719
area but then if you're in a hurricane

255
00:08:33,158 --> 00:08:36,200
situation is the grow really the

256
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,360
priority anyway you're using that

257
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:40,800
generator just to run the basics of life

258
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:42,639
and keep the keep the family alive um if

259
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:44,479
you can afford a generator set it up why

260
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:46,000
not have fun get at it but not

261
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,560
everybody's got that kind of funding I

262
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,080
think you your plants will live three or

263
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:52,239
four days without power if they really

264
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:54,200
needed to um yeah I think I've covered

265
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,080
most of the question here uh the

266
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,320
Winter's coming they can get pretty damn

267
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,800
cold and then for the hurricane season I

268
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,920
recommend uh some some sort of humidity

269
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:03,559
control I don't know what you're going

270
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:05,439
to do in there open a window start

271
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:07,119
Fanning your arms I don't know but

272
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,720
that's what I would recommend maybe that

273
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,000
humidity already flew out with the

274
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,639
hurricane I don't know man I know the

275
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,399
humidity is high in Florida right now

276
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:15,879
all right my dude bad Papa thank you for

277
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,958
the great question I hope I helped you

278
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:20,078
out I hope I gave those hurricane people

279
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:22,000
some advice if your power is flickering

280
00:09:20,078 --> 00:09:23,399
off and on just unplug it that way if

281
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,839
you get some water you're a little bit

282
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:26,120
safer anyway all right make sure you

283
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:27,680
check your inbox my dude because you've

284
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:30,120
got a coupon code for a free pack of

285
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:32,278
seeds at iir

286
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:34,120
.c all right I do have another question

287
00:09:32,278 --> 00:09:36,240
here right in front of me this one also

288
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:40,480
came from the website this one came from

289
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:41,919
OG JZ shout out to my new friend OG JZ

290
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,920
that's hard for me to say for some

291
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:46,078
reason I really could mess that up this

292
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:48,799
is a general grow question that goes a

293
00:09:46,078 --> 00:09:50,199
lot like this it says yo rosta Jeff I

294
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:52,479
love what you do for the Cannabis

295
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:54,120
Community yo thank you for noticing uh

296
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,639
and I really enjoy it when people use

297
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,360
the word community in it when they talk

298
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:58,879
about what I'm doing for ganja cuz I

299
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,480
really do try to build a community the

300
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:03,639
Discord Community is strong the IE Army

301
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:05,720
is strong uh so thank you I appreciate

302
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:07,480
it and thanks for letting me be a part

303
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,399
and a leader in the community that's

304
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:11,639
it's an honor to be welcomed into this

305
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:13,839
community because uh this community is

306
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:15,120
uh it's it's tight so thank you I'm just

307
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,480
making sure that my recording gear is

308
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,120
working right I got a weird flickering

309
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,079
light going on here everything is

310
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,600
popping up good up there all right I'm

311
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:23,039
getting paranoid now all right the

312
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,879
question goes when breeding and

313
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:28,559
collecting seeds what is the easiest way

314
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:29,919
to harvest the seeds from the plant

315
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:32,359
that's a very good question I like this

316
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:34,120
one so uh you've got a crop of plants

317
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:36,039
they are fully seeded is what I'm going

318
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:37,440
to assume breeding and collecting seeds

319
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:40,439
what's the easiest way to harvest the

320
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,600
seeds so uh when the plants are done I

321
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,839
chop down the entire plant I hang it

322
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,399
upside down I get the plant tag and I

323
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:48,560
attach it to that plant so that it will

324
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,958
not come away from that plant that tag

325
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:51,278
and that plant will continue together

326
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:53,559
for the rest of their lives when that's

327
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:55,480
a bag of seeds that plant tag ends up in

328
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:57,119
the bag of seeds it'll travel its whole

329
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:59,560
life with it I don't want any confusion

330
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,200
so chop down the Plant hang it up side

331
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:04,799
down put the plant tag on it now we know

332
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:06,519
what it is I use um it's from the brand

333
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:08,559
sterlite is what they are they're little

334
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:10,360
bins that are made to store clothing

335
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:12,838
under the bed little like a tupperware

336
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:14,320
or rubber made plastic bin uh you're

337
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,760
supposed to put clothes and shoes and

338
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,000
stuff like that under it put the lid on

339
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:19,559
it and slide it under the bed for

340
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,720
storage uh I put one of those underneath

341
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:24,159
the hanging plant so that if any seeds

342
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,600
do begin to fall out they land into that

343
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:28,199
little plastic bin it's not going to

344
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,680
happen for a while but it may happen so

345
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,320
I've got each plant hung up kind of

346
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:33,399
spaced apart with a plastic bin

347
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:37,278
underneath it and then we let it get to

348
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:39,200
a very uh specific dryness uh percentage

349
00:11:37,278 --> 00:11:41,360
I need a very specific percentage of

350
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,920
dryness I've I've discovered a very

351
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:46,240
precise unit of measurement uh at which

352
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:49,120
I prefer the moisture level in my plants

353
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:51,000
when I'm going to start the next step so

354
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,720
um the next step is to uh get the plants

355
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,839
to that precise unit of measurement and

356
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:58,639
that precise unit of measurement is dry

357
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:01,160
as get these plants dry as you

358
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:02,360
want them crispy uh I want them so what

359
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:04,159
I'm going to do I'm going to put on

360
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:05,519
gloves uh and I'm going to put these

361
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:07,480
plants I'm going to just chop them into

362
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,959
smaller pieces and put them in the bin

363
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,440
I'm going to grab the stick and I'm just

364
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:12,518
going to pull the Nuggets right off the

365
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:14,000
stick just shuck that bud right into

366
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:16,159
that plastic bin I'm going to get all

367
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,360
the buds off the sticks into that bin

368
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:18,958
and then I'm going to take my gloved

369
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,680
hands and I'm just going to grind all

370
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:23,679
that bud into dust just grind it all up

371
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:25,399
gently I'm not going to crush the seeds

372
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:27,000
but I'm going to grind all that flour

373
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:29,198
material up and you'll hear the seeds

374
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,799
just fall out into your bin and all your

375
00:12:29,198 --> 00:12:32,919
weed will just be all in your face it'll

376
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:34,399
be all piled up everywhere in your bin

377
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:36,278
and then you can kind of tip that bin to

378
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,000
one side and scoop the weed material up

379
00:12:36,278 --> 00:12:39,198
to one end all the seeds Will Roll most

380
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
of the seeds will roll down to the

381
00:12:39,198 --> 00:12:42,719
bottom and you can scoop a lot of that

382
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,559
we call it chaff the bud material that

383
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,480
doesn't have seed um I don't use that

384
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:49,000
for anything that goes in a compost bin

385
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:50,920
I know that's going to ruffle a lot of

386
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,600
feathers but I've beat the out of

387
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:54,319
it it's been so beat up that if I make

388
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,399
edibles with it they come out green and

389
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,760
they don't taste good cuz all the

390
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:59,799
chlorophyll if I make concentrat same

391
00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:01,198
story all that material has been so

392
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:02,838
Disturbed that there's so much

393
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:05,599
chlorophyll just oozing out of it that

394
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:07,680
it makes bad product so it's all trash

395
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,959
it's all compost it makes it makes good

396
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:12,559
great compost and good bokashi starter

397
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:15,000
but uh so I take that buds I just pull

398
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:17,119
them off the sticks and then now I got a

399
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,839
bucket of buds or a tray of buds and I

400
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,759
take my glove take my gloved hands and

401
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:23,000
just crush up all those buds I just kind

402
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:24,278
of do this like it just crunch crunch

403
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,519
crunch and just crush it all up and

404
00:13:24,278 --> 00:13:27,278
you'll hear the seeds fall out the

405
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,679
material will fall out and then there

406
00:13:27,278 --> 00:13:31,360
are several ways from there to remove

407
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:33,759
the seed from the chaff I've got a

408
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:36,720
machine uh it's called the easy seed

409
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:38,799
seed sorder the grow it's easy seed seed

410
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,320
sorter it looks like a shoe box and it's

411
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:42,319
got a shoot on top you pour your

412
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:45,680
material in and it's got a couple of

413
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:47,360
trap doors in a fan and I am not a

414
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:50,078
physicist but the way that it works is

415
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,879
the fan blows the weed material this way

416
00:13:50,078 --> 00:13:53,838
so all the light stuff goes this way

417
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:55,439
into a drawer and it falls and all the

418
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:58,240
seeds are heavier than that so if the

419
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,639
fan doesn't blow them and it blows those

420
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,639
into another drawer and I can open a

421
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:04,039
drawer and I got seeds in one and

422
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:05,360
material in another and I'll dump those

423
00:14:04,039 --> 00:14:07,439
seeds into a little bin and then I'll

424
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,759
run that material one more time honestly

425
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,759
just to be careful and make sure I get

426
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:12,759
all the seeds uh cuz sometimes it'll

427
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:14,440
miss a few but I'll give it one or two

428
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:16,680
runs maybe a third run depending on how

429
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:19,199
much material you try and that that

430
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:21,278
machine pulls it apart very very quickly

431
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:23,838
there's also another machine that looks

432
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:26,078
like a um if it's a Plinko it looks like

433
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:27,360
a Plinko a Chinko Plinko machine I don't

434
00:14:26,078 --> 00:14:29,638
remember what that shit's called back in

435
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,278
the day um

436
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:32,600
there's another machine it's made uh

437
00:14:31,278 --> 00:14:34,439
it's constructed from wood and

438
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:38,000
plexiglass and it's much taller it's a

439
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:39,240
much bigger uh more cumbersome machine I

440
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,879
I wouldn't with that unless you've

441
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:43,919
got a lot of seeds to sort but this one

442
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:45,399
hooks up to a shop vac and you put two

443
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:47,278
five gallon buckets underneath it and

444
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:49,000
you pour your material in there and it

445
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:51,559
works on the same principle but the shop

446
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,078
vac will suck the weed material up and

447
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:55,239
your seeds will fall through the other

448
00:14:53,078 --> 00:14:57,679
side you got two uh you got a bucket of

449
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:59,278
weed material and a bucket of seed

450
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:01,278
material and then your shop vac got all

451
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:03,039
the really light weed in it so that's

452
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:05,439
another thing that's available if you

453
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:07,159
just Google uh hemp seed sorder these

454
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,160
things will pop up both of these will

455
00:15:07,159 --> 00:15:10,879
pop up the little white seed box that I

456
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:12,759
use is not available currently those are

457
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:14,399
all sold out but the uh the other

458
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:15,879
machine with the plexiglass on the front

459
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,278
where you can watch it operate that is

460
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:20,000
available uh both of them work very well

461
00:15:18,278 --> 00:15:21,559
I like mine cuz it's much smaller

462
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
doesn't take up very much space however

463
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:25,319
it does make a mess uh that fan shoots a

464
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,720
bunch of material out I have to do it in

465
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,160
the garage and then there's a lot of

466
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,600
sweeping up to do don't do it with the

467
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:32,120
car in the garage cuz your car will be

468
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,920
tinted green but uh let me make sure I'm

469
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:36,399
staying on track uh when breeding uh

470
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:38,559
what is the easiest way to harvest the

471
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,078
seeds yeah get it dry as and then

472
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:41,919
just pull the stick right out of the

473
00:15:40,078 --> 00:15:44,198
buds let the buds all gather into a bin

474
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:45,439
and then crush it all up and then there

475
00:15:44,198 --> 00:15:47,359
are several ways to do it if you don't

476
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,680
have one of the machines I talked about

477
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,759
uh I've heard of people just lightly

478
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:52,559
using a vacuum you got to be real

479
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:54,959
careful if you do use the vacuum just

480
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:56,479
real gingerly suck the material off the

481
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:58,599
top and get the leave the seeds on the

482
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,480
bottom you can probably gingerly figure

483
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:02,199
out how to suck the material up and get

484
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,519
those seeds out of there you guys I

485
00:16:02,198 --> 00:16:04,919
apologize for the running nose that just

486
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,639
started happening on the podcast I'm

487
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:09,278
telling you I'm recovering from that

488
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:11,278
lost Vegas skankfest plague and it's not

489
00:16:09,278 --> 00:16:13,480
over yet it keeps kind of it's perking

490
00:16:11,278 --> 00:16:14,879
back up all right where were we uh dry

491
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,639
as is the precise unit of

492
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:19,519
measurement and then get all that

493
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:21,120
material out of there before you uh seal

494
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:23,159
those seeds up in anything make sure

495
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,759
that all that green is out of there

496
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:26,318
and make sure everything's nice and dry

497
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:27,318
make sure there's no moisture left in

498
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:29,439
there because you don't want to get

499
00:16:27,318 --> 00:16:32,399
moldy seeds and that is still a

500
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,800
possibility all right my dude OG JZ

539
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:47,079
moving I do have one more good question

540
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:49,240
here in front of me this question also

541
00:17:47,079 --> 00:17:51,119
came from that growel tab this one came

542
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,919
from somebody we're going to call James

543
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:54,399
shout out to my new friend James James

544
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:56,280
thank you for the great question I've

545
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,240
got a good answer for you the question

546
00:17:56,279 --> 00:18:00,879
goes a little bit like this it says Hey

547
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,798
Rost Jeff how can I effectively deal

548
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:06,200
with fungus snats these things are out

549
00:18:02,798 --> 00:18:08,639
of control my first piece of advice is

550
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:11,558
stop overwatering I bet a lot of your

551
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:13,679
plants are overwatered also I bet you've

552
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:16,319
got house plants and I bet those plants

553
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:18,038
are all overwatered as well uh those

554
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:19,558
fungus snats come in on house plants

555
00:18:18,038 --> 00:18:22,240
those fungus snats come in in bags of

556
00:18:19,558 --> 00:18:24,079
dirt they breed very rapidly a little

557
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,960
bit of overwatering will encourage more

558
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:29,038
fungus snats so uh stop overwatering a

559
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,840
little bit uh stop overwatering your

560
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:33,640
house plants also check your drains in

561
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:35,480
your house sometimes those drains get a

562
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,919
little bit funky uh you'll start getting

563
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:39,038
some fungus snats some little bugs

564
00:18:36,919 --> 00:18:40,200
flying up from there check those maybe

565
00:18:39,038 --> 00:18:41,359
those drains need a little bit of

566
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,600
treatment there's a lot of things you

567
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:45,158
can do for those as well that may be

568
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:46,678
another source of your fungus snats the

569
00:18:45,159 --> 00:18:48,679
drains all the drains in your house the

570
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:50,559
showers the sinks check on that I know

571
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:52,080
it sounds funky but that's where they

572
00:18:50,558 --> 00:18:54,000
will like to congregate so check all

573
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:55,720
your ganja plants your house plants all

574
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,159
those drains if you can cover those

575
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,440
drains that's a good idea that'll keep

576
00:18:57,159 --> 00:19:00,640
the fungus knats from coming up there

577
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:02,360
squ some lemon juice put a cover on it

578
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,400
that'll help you out really quickly uh

579
00:19:02,359 --> 00:19:06,240
but stop overwatering the plants uh the

580
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,798
house plants and the ganja plants is the

581
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,679
first piece of advice uh let that soil

582
00:19:08,798 --> 00:19:12,200
dry out a little bit that will let them

583
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:14,038
die off they won't be able to breede in

584
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:16,200
there they won't be as happy in there

585
00:19:14,038 --> 00:19:17,839
defoliate the lowers if you're if the

586
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,600
lower part of your ganja plants are

587
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:21,678
touching the dirt take that off of there

588
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:23,279
defoliate all that lower I like to

589
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:25,440
defoliate a lot of the bottoms of the

590
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:28,720
plants uh that'll help mitigate a lot of

591
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,720
the bug problems then if we need to do

592
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,919
some chemical treatments this is when I

593
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,960
would recommend a soil dredge this is

594
00:19:32,919 --> 00:19:36,840
very easy to do if your plants are

595
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,240
healthy this will not cause any problems

596
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:40,158
at all if your plants are a little angry

597
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,558
and don't have healthy Roots this could

598
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:44,000
cause them to get a little bit pissed

599
00:19:41,558 --> 00:19:45,879
off but what I would do is I would mix

600
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,240
up first of all I would try a soil

601
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:51,159
dredge with a very simple product called

602
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:53,200
mosquito bits or mosquito dunks uh it

603
00:19:51,159 --> 00:19:55,640
comes in a mosquito dunks and bits are

604
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,519
really easy to find the uh dunks are

605
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:59,559
easier to find than the bits in my

606
00:19:57,519 --> 00:20:02,200
opinion I order the bits on Amazon they

607
00:19:59,558 --> 00:20:03,720
show up quite quickly mosquito dunks or

608
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,960
mosquito bits they're the same thing

609
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:07,759
just in a different form one's a big dut

610
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:09,240
one's the doughnut already crushed up

611
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:11,558
which is advantageous CU I'm going to

612
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:13,558
tell you to crush the doughnut up anyway

613
00:20:11,558 --> 00:20:16,200
uh put some of that mosquito bit stuff

614
00:20:13,558 --> 00:20:17,678
in your water uh you can't put too much

615
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,960
put a bunch of it in there mix it up I

616
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:22,000
want to see it floating around a little

617
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,679
bit in there then water the plants uh

618
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,519
this method will not bother your plants

619
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,960
at all that any plants can handle this

620
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:28,519
do this to all your plants your house

621
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:31,120
plants your ganja plants water it with

622
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:32,960
the mosquito bits uh water it uh just

623
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:35,119
like you normally would water water as

624
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,558
heavily as you normally would let it dry

625
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:38,798
once it dries water with this again uh

626
00:20:37,558 --> 00:20:40,038
what we're trying to do is get this in

627
00:20:38,798 --> 00:20:41,639
there a couple of times and really

628
00:20:40,038 --> 00:20:44,000
saturate the plant with the beneficial

629
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,720
bacteria that is in these mosquito bits

630
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,960
uh that'll make those bugs get the

631
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:49,480
out of there they won't want to be there

632
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:52,440
they can't survive they will leave so my

633
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:54,120
first attempt is the mosquito dunks or

634
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,919
mosquito bits give them a nice water

635
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:57,479
with that they're very available uh

636
00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:00,038
they're on Amazon you can find them at

637
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:01,880
Target Lowe's home Depot possibly your

638
00:21:00,038 --> 00:21:04,000
local mom and popop hardware store but

639
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:05,919
they are very available uh get those in

640
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,480
the water water the plants also water

641
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:10,000
the house plants uh that will help any

642
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,159
standing water you've got around you can

643
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,400
throw some of that in there that will

644
00:21:11,159 --> 00:21:15,760
help get rid of the mosquitoes and the

645
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:18,480
little fungus gnats if that does not

646
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:21,519
work then that's when I would step up to

647
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:23,558
either evergreen or Panic or maybe even

648
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:25,839
botanigard Max and I would do a soil

649
00:21:23,558 --> 00:21:28,200
dredge with one of those three products

650
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:30,278
don't mix those but do a soil dredge I

651
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:33,519
would start start with Evergreen uh do a

652
00:21:30,278 --> 00:21:35,319
small maybe 15 to 30 MLS uh per gallon

653
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:36,639
of Evergreen that's kind of heavy maybe

654
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:38,359
go a little bit lighter if your plants

655
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,038
aren't in good shape so go ahead and do

656
00:21:38,359 --> 00:21:41,918
a soil dredge with the Evergreen get

657
00:21:40,038 --> 00:21:43,679
that down in the soil that way the bugs

658
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:45,360
don't want to be in there uh then let

659
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,400
them dry up and then repeat that again

660
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:49,158
in about 2 to three days if the plants

661
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,440
look healthy enough to survive through

662
00:21:49,159 --> 00:21:52,320
that it's going to do some damage to the

663
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:53,679
roots cuz it is oily it's going to

664
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:56,000
frustrate them but that's how we're

665
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:59,000
going to get rid of the bugs if you

666
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,798
really want to if they're bad uh also do

667
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,400
a foler spray you could do the uh banic

668
00:22:01,798 --> 00:22:05,879
foler spray you could do the Evergreen

669
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:07,559
foler spray you could do botanic guard

670
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:09,039
Max there's several fol year sprays

671
00:22:07,558 --> 00:22:10,319
you've already got the Evergreen because

672
00:22:09,038 --> 00:22:12,679
that's what I recommend for the soil

673
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:16,119
dredge you could spray it with that but

674
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:18,440
I think uh two doses of the soil of the

675
00:22:16,119 --> 00:22:20,678
mosquito dunks should get rid of them if

676
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:22,840
not step up your game do an evergreen

677
00:22:20,679 --> 00:22:24,440
dredge do it again in two or three days

678
00:22:22,839 --> 00:22:26,038
and if you really want to get frisky in

679
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,640
there go ahead and spray at the same

680
00:22:26,038 --> 00:22:29,158
time you probably should spray anyway if

681
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,720
you've got fungus snack

682
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:32,480
uh there's also an opportunity you got

683
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:35,200
some other bugs go ahead and hit it with

684
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:37,919
a decent spray of the Evergreen or the

685
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,519
