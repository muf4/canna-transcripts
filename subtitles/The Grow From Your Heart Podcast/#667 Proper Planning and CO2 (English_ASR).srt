subconsciously heard doug benson but we

99
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:43,759
saw doug stanhope a few nights ago i've

100
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,680
seen so many comedians in my lifetime

101
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:47,518
i'm a huge comedy nerd

102
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,879
that was my first time seeing stan hope

103
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,959
i've never seen stan hope before i've

104
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:52,798
been listening to his podcast for uh

105
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,878
probably years i've known who stanhope

106
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,319
was for a very long time he's always

107
00:03:54,878 --> 00:03:58,399
been one of my favorite comedians he was

108
00:03:56,318 --> 00:04:00,479
part of the man show he was buddies with

109
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,920
joe rogan so he's been one of my

110
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:03,919
favorite comedians for a long time but

111
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:05,518
to see him live was a huge honor i've

112
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:07,759
been super excited for that of course i

113
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,519
had tickets about 18 months ago and

114
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:10,719
everything got pushed back because of uh

115
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,319
i don't know what happened some weird

116
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:14,878
[ __ ] delayed everything everybody was

117
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:16,719
like 18 months late for something uh but

118
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:18,719
it was a great time to see him he

119
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,560
[ __ ] blew the roof off that building

120
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,400
he crushed he's got such a great rhythm

121
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,560
it took him a minute to get into his

122
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:26,560
rhythm but once he got into that rhythm

123
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,319
he's got a really a cadence i keep doing

124
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,160
these hand movements he like does a

125
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:31,599
thing and it's that's comedy you set up

126
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,439
a joke and you tell the punchline you

127
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,400
set up a joke and tell the punchline but

128
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:38,160
doug stanhope has a very uh distinct

129
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:40,478
rhythm and way of talking and a way of

130
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,120
thinking and then he does a lot of

131
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:44,639
that's a setup punch line then a couple

132
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,560
of more punch lines after that just the

133
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,319
way he was doing it was beautiful and he

134
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,600
hit that rhythm that thing that i'm used

135
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:51,439
to like when you go see your favorite

136
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,199
band when they play your favorite song

137
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:54,639
comedians don't have a favorite some of

138
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:57,040
them do but most comedians don't repeat

139
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,960
their jokes a lot so

140
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,479
to hear him hit that rhythm was what i

141
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:01,680
was looking for and it just felt so good

142
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:03,279
it was like there he is that's the

143
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,280
rhythm anyway i'm

144
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:07,439
just excited to be going to comedy shows

145
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:08,959

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,319
got in there i hit the ground running

207
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,319
your shows and my research have really

208
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:13,120
helped me earn the respect of my team

209
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:15,280
and people are always asking my opinion

210
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,399
on things and how to grow in general

211
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:17,758
that is awesome

212
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:19,198
but kind of keep in mind and we're going

213
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,360
to get to more of this in the message

214
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,960
here that uh they hired you you didn't

215
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,319
hire them so you kind of got to go by

216
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:25,918
their way but if they're gonna they're

217
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:29,360
gonna ask you for questions always have

218
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:31,519
good answers it says uh the job is tough

219
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,960
though every day i see things we need to

220
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:35,439
work on that is the way a commercial

221
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:36,879
grow is always going to go uh i see that

222
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:38,879
in my personal growth i see that in

223
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:41,199
commercial grows they're always going to

224
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:42,800
be things for somebody to work on always

225
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,560
room for improvement the fact that you

226
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,160
see it means that you're aware that

227
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,439
you're not turning a blind eye to it

228
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,360
that you know there's room for

229
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:50,800
improvement that's always a good sign

230
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:54,000
let's continue with this message because

231
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:56,240
i am rambling today it says

232
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,360
my biggest concern is that our plants

233
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:01,038
are growing too quickly and too tall i

234
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,038
want to lay out some ideas for my boss

235
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:05,598
to consider for controlling the stretch

236
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:07,038
and flower all right so the plants are

237
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:08,719
getting too fast too tall and they're

238
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:09,839
stretching and flower that makes a lot

239
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,080
of sense

240
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:14,239
then it says i feel like we are falling

241
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:16,079
let's see there's more that i skipped uh

242
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,319
we do trellising in three layers all

243
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:19,598
right that makes sense most of it i do

244
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,039
with another person yeah it usually

245
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:23,120
takes one or two people to throw out a

246
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:24,800
big trellis on a big canopy i feel like

247
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,959
we're falling behind a lot because of

248
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,960
the growth rates and lack of knowledge

249
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:31,120
on plant work from some of the less

250
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:32,958
experienced folks all right so the

251
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,240
plants are growing real fast

252
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,838
they're growing quickly with a lot of

253
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,519
vigor but you're falling behind because

254
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,360
the people can't keep up with the plants

255
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,038
that does make sense

256
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,639
currently we're using thousand watt high

257
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:45,039
pressure sodiums that hang at a set

258
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:47,120
height the same goes for the fans i told

259
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:49,360
my boss i heard the environment controls

260
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,879
for uh calming things down under the

261
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,039
dark period as well as adding blue

262
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:54,399
spectrum uh yeah that would help but

263
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:56,719
that's not gonna help a lot this is more

264
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,240
of a scheduling issue uh win burn and

265
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,360
light burn are killing a good portion of

266
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,360
our yields

267
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,759
uh so you just turn down those [ __ ]

268
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,519
fans dude and i want to help i'd like to

269
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:07,278
get some ammo for serious conversation

270
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,720
with my leadership to get us on the

271
00:09:07,278 --> 00:09:10,399
right track and have more consistent

272
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,080
growth patterns in our rooms i'm sure

273
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,600
you want information so hit me up okay

274
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,959
i've got a good idea of what's happening

275
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,759
here your plants are just getting too

276
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:20,399
tall uh you did say you're using a three

277
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:21,439
uh tear trellis system is that first one

278
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,879
and i don't know what you're doing in

279
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,880
there i can't see i haven't had pictures

280
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:26,480
yet is that first one kind of spreading

281
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:28,159
the plants apart normally our plants

282
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,560
want to grow straight up we put the

283
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:31,759
trellis down to kind of just imagine if

284
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:33,199
your plants are growing straight up and

285
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:34,720
you came from above and just dropped a

286
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,320
net on them they're just gonna go down

287
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,680
with the net right so we kind of want

288
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,360
that effect with the net but then we

289
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:41,679
spread them out strategically use the

290
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,278
net instead of having them grow straight

291
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:44,958
up vertically we want to make them grow

292
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:47,679
horizontally a little bit so we spread

293
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:49,199
them out with the net spread them out um

294
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:50,879
instead of just going straight up you

295
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,480
can use the net squares to kind of bend

296
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:54,159
the plant over and go over here into

297
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,519
this square and then it grows up that

298
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:56,799
way so you can fill up your space

299
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,799
instead of going straight up that's a

300
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:01,039
way to get them shorter

301
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:02,639
that'll help you out a lot uh the second

302
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:04,159
net you can do the same thing work them

303
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:06,159
into that second net spread them out

304
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:07,519
with the first one weave them into the

305
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:09,360
second net then they'll grow up in the

306
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:12,480
third one they'll need supports for that

307
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:14,800
don't be afraid to grab a branch so if

308
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,800
my arm is the nug that's too tall don't

309
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:18,719
grab up at the wrist and bend the wrist

310
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:20,240
down grab down at the elbow and pop that

311
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,839
[ __ ] at the elbow and bend it down to

312
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,079
where it's horizontal and it will all

313
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:26,640
grow back up but don't be afraid to pop

314
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:28,399
it down at the elbow area crack it low

315
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:30,399
and then give it a lot of time to grow

316
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:33,200
back up and curve itself up it will grow

317
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:34,399
back up but the main thing happening

318
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,000
here

319
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,679
is just a scheduling issue if the plants

320
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,120
are getting too big and too tall and

321
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:41,120
they're growing into the lights and into

322
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,679
the fans you're probably vegging for too

323
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:46,480
long why not just veg for less time you

324
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:48,479
could veg for a week less and that would

325
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,320
save you money that would save you time

326
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,839
that would save you a lot of things

327
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,879
don't veg for so long they're getting

328
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,640
too tall

329
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:56,159
so get them shorter you could put in

330
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:58,879
blue lights that would help you but the

331
00:10:56,159 --> 00:11:00,399
main main thing is to just veg for a

332
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:03,439
shorter period a lot of popping and

333
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:05,200
twisting uh like between the time you

334
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,800
flip and probably week three and four a

335
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,320
flower if you can pop and twist that

336
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:10,479
will help you a lot that'll stop them

337
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,760
from growing uh vertically because

338
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,879
they'll be spending more of their time

339
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:14,319
and energy

340
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:15,600
repairing what you've done to popping

341
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,720
the cellulose structure and it won't

342
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,720
mess up your buds they're still

343
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,560
transitioning uh they're still going

344
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,720
from the veg to the flower stage the

345
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:24,479
hormones are all changing over uh then

346
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,680
like week four five and six those nugs

347
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,519
will really pack on but you can

348
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:29,359
definitely pop and twist them but this

349
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,919
is more of a scheduling and planning

350
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,680
issue just flower earlier so my main

351
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:35,278
question that i would ask now you said

352
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:36,719
that the plants are getting too tall the

353
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:38,159
main problem sounds like the plants are

354
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,480
too tall they're growing into the fans

355
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:43,120
and they're growing into the lights

356
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,440
what week are they getting too tall i'm

357
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,600
assuming you're running a nine probably

358
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,360
a nine maybe a ten maybe an eight week

359
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,839
flowering phase i'm gonna say nine weeks

360
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,519
right we're at nine weeks what week do

361
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,440
you see them getting too tall is it week

362
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,360
seven they start getting too tall week

363
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,040
eight they get too tall whatever week

364
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,519
they're getting too tall reduce that

365
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:02,958
many weeks off of your veg phase so if

366
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,480
they're getting too tall a week seven

367
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:06,399
you're doing a nine week flower phase

368
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,159
take two weeks off of the veg phase we

369
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:10,078
can't cut time off the flowering phase

370
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:11,679
that's not possible so we've got to just

371
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:14,559
cut time off somewhere else and that

372
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:15,838
would be your veg phase and why not just

373
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:17,359
get them out of the clone or get them

374
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,560
into pots and ah it sounds like you

375
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,159
might just get them right into [ __ ]

376
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:21,838
flour at this point i'll get them

377
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:23,759
trellised out so you get them out of the

378
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,760
cloner get them into the probably their

379
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:27,039
final pots it sounds like from if you

380
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:28,799
don't have a lot of time i really don't

381
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:30,319
know how long you're vegging but get

382
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:32,719
them into their final pots top them

383
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,240
trellis them out flour them boom uh turn

384
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,000
and burn there's no need to veg them for

385
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,240
extra time you're probably wasting time

386
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,159
anyway if they're that tall or learn to

387
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,079
spread them out more vertically

388
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:44,000
the blue lights would help you out but

389
00:12:42,078 --> 00:12:45,519
it's not going to keep them

390
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,600
that short and compact and now here's

391
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:49,600
where the breeder part comes in are you

392
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:53,120
growing the correct genetics maybe you

393
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,720
need different genes in that room um

394
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,959
if you got me you're not running a

395
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,320
basketball team you're running a

396
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:59,599
different team who's short maybe a

397
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,440
soccer team i don't know what sport

398
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,879
would benefit from people being shorter

399
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,279
but on the basketball team you want the

400
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:07,600
7 foot 10 guys on the soccer team maybe

401
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:09,039
you got the five foot nine guys uh maybe

402
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,720
you don't have room for the basketball

403
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:13,199
team in your grow maybe you need to find

404
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,320
some more soccer team mates in that grow

405
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,839
maybe what i'm trying to say some

406
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,360
shorter squattier stuff that'll grow

407
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:19,120
better for you maybe you don't want

408
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,519
those 11-week sativas in that room

409
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,839
anyway shorter flowering stuff that

410
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:26,159
stays shorter probably would work better

411
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:28,240
in that room so one thing i would say is

412
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:29,759
genetics understand your genetics do you

413
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,600
have the appropriate genetics in this

414
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:33,600
room do you know those genetics have you

415
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,519
grown them enough times to understand

416
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,278
what makes them stretch how long do they

417
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,720
stretch how long do they flower know

418
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:40,639
your genetics how long have you been

419
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,800
running this stuff understand the

420
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,639
stretch for each plant and then adjust

421
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:46,559
your veg phase i keep saying it we can't

422
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:49,120
change the flowering time adjust your

423
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:51,119
veg phase to work more for these plants

424
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,519
if you're running out of space two weeks

425
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,879
and before you're done cut off two weeks

426
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,799
if you're running out of space three

427
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:59,039
weeks cut off three weeks you can only

428
00:13:56,799 --> 00:14:00,719
do it at the veg end so you're gonna

429
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:02,399
have to figure out your timing there

430
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,560
don't grow them so big

431
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,320
maybe top them make them shorter before

432
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:08,399
you go into flower but this is something

433
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,360
that has to be done in

434
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,399
veg

435
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:14,079
um i do have some more notes here

436
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:15,839
one of my notes is you're not supposed

437
00:14:14,078 --> 00:14:17,439
to burn them until after you sell them

438
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:19,040
so if they're growing into the lights

439
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,040
just make them shorter we know that we

440
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:22,480
can't raise the lights we already know

441
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:23,838
that we've got to have at least

442
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,759
depending on your lights if you've got

443
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:28,079
gavitas you need like two feet between

444
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:30,078
the light and the canopy so prepare for

445
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:31,599
that are you growing on tables are you

446
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:33,278
growing on the floor are you growing on

447
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,560
pots is there anything we can adjust in

448
00:14:33,278 --> 00:14:36,240
that range

449
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:38,479
i really think it's a timing issue

450
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:41,120
though just start flowering sooner so

451
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:43,120
subtract some weeks of course you are i

452
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,639
understand that you are a grow tech or

453
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,560
something similar in that environment

454
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:49,120
there's probably a lead grower then

455
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:50,559
there is probably a like a manager of

456
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,240
the facility or something and then

457
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:54,239
there's probably an owner they probably

458
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,959
have investors probably a bunch of

459
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,159
people arguing over what to do but it

460
00:14:56,958 --> 00:15:00,479
sounds like you've identified the

461
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:02,719
problem the plants are growing into the

462
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,278
lights and into the fans which is

463
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,879
basically a scheduling issue uh you know

464
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:07,919
they're going to keep growing you know

465
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:09,759
you know they're going to get bigger

466
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:13,919
they're not going to stop doing it so i

467
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:15,439
think the solution is to flower earlier

468
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:16,799
maybe send me some pictures send me some

469
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,880
videos let me know what's going on maybe

470
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:20,159
i can send you an update but the

471
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:23,120
solution

472
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:24,639
is flower sooner maybe more smaller

473
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,360
plants instead of growing a bunch of

474
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:29,120
really tall plants grow a whole bunch of

475
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,600
really small plants that may be the way

476
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,679
to do it for you you got less veg time

477
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,278
just put more plants in there and that

478
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:37,278
way they don't have to get as tall you

479
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:38,480
just fill the space more is your canopy

480
00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:40,799
full that's one of the most important

481
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,800
things to think about is the canopy full

482
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:44,799
if you've got super tall stretchy plants

483
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:46,879
and the canopy is not full you're

484
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:48,159
wasting a lot of space also you got

485
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:49,439
thousand watt lights in there do you

486
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:51,360
have enough lights because if you have

487
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,279
enough they won't be so stretchy so

488
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,399
think about the genetics think about the

489
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:55,679
kind of light

490
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:57,759
think about do you have enough light

491
00:15:55,679 --> 00:16:00,559
think about the spectrum

492
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:02,639
then properly pop and twist uh honestly

493
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:04,638
though this is a timing issue maybe run

494
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:05,919
a bunch of smaller plants

495
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:08,159
all right hey bro thank you for the

496
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:09,519
great message i did not say your name uh

497
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:11,439
just because i don't want to get you in

498
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,799
any trouble if the work hears this and

499
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,560
you're not prepared to talk to them or

500
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:16,319
whatever but bro thank you for the great

501
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:19,359
message all right i'm going to move on

502
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:21,120
to another message this one comes from

503
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,360
oh this is from our buddy slightly

504
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,278
stoned stupid what's up buddy i'm

505
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,680
slightly stoned stupid as well it's been

506
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:29,600
a great day um and i got these bright

507
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:30,958
ass lights in my face uh so when you

508
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,000
take some fat dabs you get these bright

509
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:34,078
lights in your face it's like you're

510
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,919
extra blazed which is really great shout

511
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:38,239
out to my buddy slightly stoned stupid

512
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:40,159
they sent a question that said maybe you

513
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,278
could talk about co2 levels and what

514
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:44,719
they should be

515
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:46,320
at pre-harvest in a co2 enriched grow

516
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,879
i'm asking because i have a perpetual

517
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:51,360
harvest going in one big flower room so

518
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:54,078
a few plants come down every week but is

519
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,680
it bad to have co2 levels around 12 to

520
00:16:54,078 --> 00:16:57,278
1500

521
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:59,439
all right so i do understand the

522
00:16:57,278 --> 00:17:01,198
question uh most of the time we would

523
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,279
crank up the co2 to certain levels

524
00:17:01,198 --> 00:17:05,119
depending on the stage of veg or flower

525
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:06,880
in which we are in but our friend

526
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:09,438
slightly stoned stupid here is running a

527
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:12,000
perpetual space so sometimes they may

528
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:14,480
have plants at week nine possibly week

529
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,400
seven possibly week six possibly four or

530
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,679
two i don't know the rotation and the

531
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,679
scheduling but i know they're in

532
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:22,079
different stages which makes a lot of

533
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:24,079
sense and is a very good idea now you've

534
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:25,359
got a constant supply of medicine and

535
00:17:24,078 --> 00:17:27,838
you don't always have to trim a whole

536
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:30,719
bunch of herb i like this their main

537
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:32,960
concern is is the high co2 level going

538
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,558
to have a problem uh with plants that

539
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,480
are further into flower plants that are

540
00:17:34,558 --> 00:17:37,839
not as far into flower are all of the

541
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:41,120
plants going to be happy with the

542
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:44,480
augmented co2 my answer is your 12 to

543
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:46,399
1500 particles per million of co2

544
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,400
is [ __ ] perfect bro that's ideal

545
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,720
that's beautiful uh you're hitting right

546
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,400
in the sweet spot uh if you have enough

547
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,759
light they're going to love that if you

548
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,160
don't have enough light that may be

549
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:57,519
overdoing it it may be honestly just a

550
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,000
waste if they don't have enough light

551
00:17:57,519 --> 00:18:01,599
going on with that co2 they can't use

552
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,519
the co2 it will be a way they won't be

553
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:05,199
able to photosynthesize anyway so

554
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:06,400
they'll be taking in the extra co2 and

555
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,480
they'll be like if we just had some

556
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,240
light we could go fast so as long as you

557
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:13,038
got enough light in there to go with

558
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,480
that co2 they're going to

559
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:15,919
love that

560
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,400
so let's talk a little bit more about

561
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:21,759
co2 since we're on this topic here uh

562
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:24,160
1200 to 2000 particles per million is

563
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:24,879
ideal uh depending on the stage you're

564
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,880
in

565
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:30,480
in most commercial environments i try to

566
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:32,320
hit about 1400 ppms in flower uh the

567
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,480
owners say stay at a thousand because

568
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:35,839
the shit's expensive the consultants say

569
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,160
hit 15.

570
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:39,359
1250 to 1400 is ideal where you want to

571
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,320
go for it and they're in a commercial

572
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:44,879
environment co2 can get expensive uh

573
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:46,480
over 2 000 particles per million is

574
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,720
excessive i don't think the plants can

575
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,079
even take over 18 definitely not over 2

576
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,160
000 maybe they can but i don't think

577
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:53,439
it's going to be cost effective i think

578
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,120
you're going to get weird stuff

579
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,679
happening after that

580
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:59,759
3 000 particles per million is dangerous

581
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:02,000
for humans so once you get that 3 000

582
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:03,599
particles per million of co2 in the air

583
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,279
for a human it gets dangerous it'll

584
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:06,719
start making you feel dizzy light-headed

585
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:09,918
it'll [ __ ] you up it'll definitely start

586
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:13,519
causing problems for the plants ah 5000

587
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:16,080
ppms is fatal we're all gonna die so

588
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:17,918
uh try not to get above that 2k i think

589
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:19,599
you're doing great with your 12 to 15

590
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,679
but if you've got the uh the ability to

591
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:23,918
crank it up don't go much higher than 18

592
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:25,280
to 2000 it's going to be fine

593
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:26,960
i try to hover

594
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:30,000
honestly in a commercial environment we

595
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:32,558
hover around a thousand to 1200 ppms i

596
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,400
try for that 1400 but the doors are open

597
00:19:32,558 --> 00:19:36,558
the fans are running the exhaust fans

598
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,559
happen uh the co2 gets just shot right

599
00:19:36,558 --> 00:19:41,839
out of the ceiling sometimes in the room

600
00:19:38,558 --> 00:19:43,759
so ah we hover in most of the facilities

601
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:45,599
where i'm working we hover around a

602
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:47,599
thousand to twelve hundred ppms is what

603
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:50,240
we stay around again fourteen hundred

604
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:51,678
would be ideal but doors open [ __ ]

605
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:54,319
cracks in the walls all that [ __ ] this

606
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:56,240
[ __ ] gets away uh ambient so i'm talking

607
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:58,639
about augmented co2 these are places

608
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,640
where we are getting a uh we in the

609
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,159
commercial grows we do it kind of fancy

610
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,400
we have a truck that shows up and loads

611
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:06,000
up a bunch of tanks with co2 and we've

612
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,880
got machines inside the rooms that just

613
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,759
disperse co2 based on a monitor but uh

614
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,360
that's augmented co2 in most

615
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:15,440
environments like in this room right now

616
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:18,079
i don't have any co2 augmentation or

617
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:22,000
outside or whatever it's probably around

618
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:24,158
400 to 450 uh particles per million of

619
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,240
co2 just naturally in the environment so

620
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:29,039
when we crank it up to a thousand or

621
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,558
1200 we are tripling the natural co2

622
00:20:29,038 --> 00:20:31,839
which really gives the plant some turbo

623
00:20:30,558 --> 00:20:34,158
it's like nitrous for the plants

624
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:35,678
basically it's co2 but it is basically

625
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:37,039
nitrous for the plants you put them on

626
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:40,320
turbo mode

627
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:43,279
um so it is ideal to gradually increase

628
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:45,439
co2 levels uh but it's not required you

629
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:46,879
can like if you just got the equipment

630
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,480
you just got the funding to do it you

631
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,960
can go in there just blast those [ __ ]

632
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,558
up go from your ambient 400 go right up

633
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,840
to 2000 if that's what you want to do

634
00:20:52,558 --> 00:20:56,399
they'll make it it'll happen they'll

635
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:57,839
survive uh they'll thrive with that but

636
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,360
it would be more cost effective and it

637
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:01,279
wouldn't be a problem to just slowly

638
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:03,119
ramp it up start off just augmenting a

639
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:04,639
little bit more and more every day have

640
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:06,639
a co2 monitor in there if you're going

641
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,080
to use co2 have a monitor make sure it

642
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,000
doesn't get too high i mentioned before

643
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:11,759
it can get dangerously high

644
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,519
that'll take a lot of co2 to do that but

645
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:15,519
have a monitor there are a lot of

646
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:18,319
different ways to augment co2 in a grow

647
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:20,158
space i usually do the canisters with

648
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:22,399
the regulator and the monitor and the

649
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:24,000
monitor sees how much co2 is in the room

650
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,080
when it gets below a threshold it knows

651
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,919
to turn on the thing it opens a solenoid

652
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:30,399
the co2 blasts into the room you run it

653
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:32,480
through lines put the lines above the

654
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,400
plants because the co2 is heavier than

655
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,640
oxygen so it's going to fall down onto

656
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,400
your plants maybe put a fan down low

657
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:41,120
blowing back up to push it back up and

658
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:43,280
just cycle that air also here's a random

659
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:45,439
tip a fan

660
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:48,000
a fan down low pointing up will help

661
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:50,080
disrupt insects uh insects are trying to

662
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,359
land on your leaves and uh hang out and

663
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:53,599
make a little space there if you've got

664
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:54,639
a fan blowing up those bugs don't want

665
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:56,399
to land there they're going what the

666
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,640
[ __ ] why is the wind going up the wind

667
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,480
doesn't ever go up so they get confused

668
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,880
they don't want to hang out there so i

669
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:05,120
like to do uh the canisters and a

670
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,640
regulator and a monitor is the best way

671
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:08,879
to do it in my opinion there are several

672
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,799
other ways you can put a burner in your

673
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,640
grow space the co2 burner is very

674
00:22:10,798 --> 00:22:14,079
efficient it does burn natural gas it's

675
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,320
always turned on you got a little flame

676
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:18,399
going get your co2 going there that is

677
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:20,639
going to increase your heat in some

678
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,720
places that's cool in some places that

679
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,559
will not work for you at all

680
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:27,360
um a lot of people do

681
00:22:24,558 --> 00:22:29,519
a little mushroom kit bags and just co2

682
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:32,399
bags and things depending on your space

683
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:34,798
i don't see the uh cost effectiveness of

684
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,640
those unless you have a tiny tiny space

685
00:22:34,798 --> 00:22:38,798
and if your space is that tiny you're

686
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,679
not really focused on co2 augmentation

687
00:22:38,798 --> 00:22:41,759
anyway

688
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:43,679
but uh that will work for you if you've

689
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:45,279
got something tiny so there's a burner

690
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:47,360
there's a canister set up and then there

691
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:48,798
are all kinds of little mushroom bags

692
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:50,959
that they sell and then some people will

693
00:22:48,798 --> 00:22:52,879
brew some wine or brew some beer and use

694
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,360
that co2 to augment the grow space as

695
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:58,000
well uh double up double your pleasure

696
00:22:55,359 --> 00:23:02,639
double your fun don't overdo it uh the

697
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,839
plants can become immune to too much co2

698
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,440
that's right if you it's just like

699
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:07,199
giving them too much drugs bro it's just

700
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,720
like they'll start building a tolerance

701
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,960
and then they won't uh they won't

702
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,798
perform if you start overdoing it so if

703
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,159
you introduce it too soon this is why i

704
00:23:12,798 --> 00:23:16,558
said it may be a good idea to slowly

705
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:20,320
introduce them if you go too hard too

706
00:23:16,558 --> 00:23:21,599
soon they're like oh 1800 ppms of co2

707
00:23:20,319 --> 00:23:24,158
sweet thank you and they're gonna start

708
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:25,918
performing real hard going real crazy

709
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:29,280
but six or eight weeks later they're

710
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:31,759
gonna go oh 1800 ppms of co2

711
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:33,759
cool i'll grow kind of fast they're not

712
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:36,158
going to be as excited about it so maybe

713
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:38,158
introduce it slowly build your way up

714
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:40,960
and then they will not get their

715
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:42,960
immunity so to speak to the co2 it will

716
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,880
work better for them one thing i will

717
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,720
suggest because it is my responsibility

718
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,480
is if you are going to augment co2 in

719
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,759
your environment if you're going to use

720
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,759
a burner if you're going to use a

721
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:53,038
canister do have some sort of monitor in

722
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:55,278
there do have some sort of way to let

723
00:23:53,038 --> 00:23:57,359
yourself know that co2 is too high it

724
00:23:55,278 --> 00:24:00,000
can be fatal if we get it in super high

725
00:23:57,359 --> 00:24:01,599
concentrations so please don't die

726
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,720
growing weed we don't need that [ __ ]

727
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:04,879
that will not look good for the

728
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,880
community for the movement for anything

729
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,559
and we love you we need you here so

730
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,320
don't die growing weed all right my

731
00:24:08,558 --> 00:24:11,678

i think this was a short episode but i'm

740
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,558
going to wrap it up i think it is all

741
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,079
about quality over quantity i think this

742
00:24:30,558 --> 00:24:33,759
was a good show i could ramble on and

743
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:35,599
make it longer if you want but what

744

conversation about some ire genetic

00:24:57,038 --> 00:25:00,720
strains talking about growing weed in

757
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,960
the mountains or

758
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,640
