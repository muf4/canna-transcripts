99
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:27,569
put some podcast together come to a show

100
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:29,400
with me alright um on episode 250 I did

101
00:03:27,568 --> 00:03:31,768
a little bit of a contest I've been

102
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,969
doing uh throwback Thursday episodes

103
00:03:31,769 --> 00:03:34,379
I've been putting some really creative

104
00:03:32,969 --> 00:03:35,789
music at the beginning of those that's

105
00:03:34,378 --> 00:03:36,929
just me killing time with my computer

106
00:03:35,789 --> 00:03:39,419
here when I'm waiting for something else

107
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:42,870
but in some of that creative intro music

108
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:44,878
I think it's episode number 248 there is

109
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:47,370
a voice and it says oh [ __ ] Rasta Jeff

110
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:49,289
in the house in episode 250 I offered a

111
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:52,650
prize to anybody who can identify that

112
00:03:49,289 --> 00:03:55,439
voice ah so far nobody has identified

113
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:58,079
who said that little clip they simply

114
00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:00,359
say oh [ __ ] Rasta Jeff in the house if

115
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:02,400
you can identify who that person is you

116
00:04:00,359 --> 00:04:04,109
will win a prize there's also another

117
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,180
contest with a prize available at the

118
00:04:04,109 --> 00:04:08,549
start of that episode there's a

119
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:10,799
backwards clip I played a clip backwards

120
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:13,230
and it's a person saying something if

121
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,120
you can identify the person you win one

122
00:04:13,229 --> 00:04:18,238
prize if you can identify what that

123
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,459
person says you will win a second prize

124
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:22,319
so there are three options for prizes I

125
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:23,970
can't tell you what the prizes are

126
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:25,800
because it will vary depending on your

127
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:27,690
location and age if you're here in

128
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,220
Colorado and you're over 21 the prizes

129
00:04:27,689 --> 00:04:32,250
will be much cooler than if you're

130
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:34,800
anywhere else so three options listen

131
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:37,680
again episode 248 see if you can

132
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,840
identify those voices so far everybody

133
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,759
has been wrong it is not Doug Benson a

134
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:43,949
lot of people keep guessing Doug Benson

135
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,288
it is not Doug Benson let me just say

136
00:04:43,949 --> 00:04:48,000
that because all of my inboxes are

137
00:04:46,288 --> 00:04:50,579
getting stuffed with guesses that its

138
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,970
Doug Benson my email my Instagram box my

139
00:04:50,579 --> 00:04:53,339
Twitter

140
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:55,560
it is not Doug Benson you guys so don't

141
00:04:53,339 --> 00:04:57,899
guess Doug Benson that is a wrong guess

142
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,310
at somebody else and it was not Ralphie

143
00:04:57,899 --> 00:05:01,649
May somebody else guessed Ralphie may

144
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:03,629
not Ralphie May unfortunately I never

145
00:05:01,649 --> 00:05:05,339
got the opportunity to meet or hang out

146
00:05:03,629 --> 00:05:07,560
with Ralphie May I've hung out and met

147
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:08,489
and smoked and dabbed with a lot of my

148
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,649
favorite comedians

149
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:13,319
but Ralphie May was just never available

150
00:05:10,649 --> 00:05:14,579
he always did he did the bigger shows

151
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:15,959
and the bigger shows it's a little

152
00:05:14,579 --> 00:05:17,908
harder to meet those people that are on

153
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:19,439
that level there are certain levels of

154
00:05:17,908 --> 00:05:20,709
Fame and success that these comedians

155
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:22,750
get to

156
00:05:20,709 --> 00:05:24,639
and I it works if I meet them and

157
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:26,709
discover them and make a presence with

158
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:29,379
them right before they do the break I

159
00:05:26,709 --> 00:05:31,719
missed Rogan I'm not I don't interact

160
00:05:29,379 --> 00:05:33,519
with Joe Rogan but I have smoked with

161
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:35,500
Ari Shaffir and I've smoked with Joey

162
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:38,199
Diaz and I've smoked with a few of

163
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:40,149
Rogen's buddies and I am like actual

164
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:42,610

165
00:05:40,149 --> 00:05:43,719
and and guy o bellum and a few people on

166
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:46,180
that level so there are just certain

167
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:48,370
levels to it another day I made friends

168
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:49,810
with Doug Benson right before he got to

169
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:51,879
the break that he's getting he's on TV

170
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:53,680
now and stuff like that so you I've got

171
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:55,329
to meet them right before they get there

172
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,340
or before they get there or it's too

173
00:05:55,329 --> 00:05:58,539
late for me so I I never got to meet

174
00:05:57,339 --> 00:06:01,029
Ralphy he was already super famous

175
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:03,250
before I became a comedy nerd and

176
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:05,589
started frequenting comedy shows I did

177
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:07,180
get to see Ralphie May at the comedy

178
00:06:05,589 --> 00:06:09,039
works South location they call it the

179
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:09,699
landmark location down at the Denver

180
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,590
Tech Center

181
00:06:09,699 --> 00:06:13,870
I got to see Ralphie there and he did an

182
00:06:11,589 --> 00:06:15,879
amazing show there was a heckler that

183
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:17,620
said something and Ralphie May told him

184
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:18,909
look [ __ ] therefore exit signs

185
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:20,199
they all show you how to get the [ __ ]

186
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:22,030
out of here if you're not happy get the

187
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:23,740
[ __ ] up and leave and just the way he

188
00:06:22,029 --> 00:06:26,319
did it was so smooth he did not miss a

189
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:28,509
beat in his act he just roasted that

190
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,949
heckler anyway not Ralphie May I'm not

191
00:06:28,509 --> 00:06:31,990
sure why I went off on such a long rant

192
00:06:29,949 --> 00:06:35,079
about comedy maybe it's because I love

193
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:37,360
dads and comedy my point was it's not

194
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:38,800
Doug Benson it's not Ralphie May so I

195
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,870
would love it if you keep guessing send

196

205
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:01,600
hotmail.com all right now that I've got

206
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,640
all the business caught up and all that

207
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,920
stuff out of the way let's get into some

208
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:07,449
listener emails I love it when you guys

209
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:09,069
email me with questions and when you

210
00:07:07,449 --> 00:07:10,420
need help and guidance it lets me know

211
00:07:09,069 --> 00:07:12,610
that I'm hitting my target audience

212
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:14,199
because at least one person needed help

213
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:15,699
with this and I figured that if one

214
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:17,019
person needed help there's probably a

215
00:07:15,699 --> 00:07:19,479
lot more out there that haven't bothered

216
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:20,889
to send me an email about it so let's

217
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,270
get into this email I'm just gonna pull

218
00:07:20,889 --> 00:07:24,579
the first one off the stack of emails

219
00:07:22,269 --> 00:07:25,870
here I've got quite a few this one let's

220
00:07:24,579 --> 00:07:28,300
see that they want me to use their name

221
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:30,310
gonna go quick alright they don't say so

222
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:31,750
it goes like this hey Rasta it's me

223
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:34,089
again the guy who asked about the

224
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:35,889
trellis but most call me low-lives I

225
00:07:34,089 --> 00:07:39,009
two questions I was wanting to run by

226
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:40,720
you when should I top a plant been

227
00:07:39,009 --> 00:07:42,430
thinking of doing it in one of my grows

228
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,350
wasn't sure when the best time would be

229
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:46,090
and second I know you don't personally

230
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:48,340
grow with dwc which is deep water

231
00:07:46,089 --> 00:07:49,989
culture you guys but I'm currently going

232
00:07:48,339 --> 00:07:51,399
with that method and I wasn't sure if

233
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:53,228
you knew anyone that could come on the

234
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:55,209
show and give some advice and tips

235
00:07:53,228 --> 00:07:56,379
loving the show man getting closer to

236
00:07:55,209 --> 00:07:58,839
getting caught up and thanks for the

237
00:07:56,379 --> 00:08:02,500
info and knowledge take it easy and take

238
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:03,759
a gnarly dab for me brother all right

239
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,959
first off let me say thanks for the

240
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,668
great email this gives me a lot of

241
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:09,219
opportunity to talk about topping

242
00:08:06,668 --> 00:08:11,199
topping is a very useful trick that you

243
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:14,560
can do in your garden so also this guy

244
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,728
said take a gnarly dab for me so I'm

245
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,379
gonna press pause here you guys I feel

246
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:18,699
like I'm talking kind of fast I know you

247
00:08:17,379 --> 00:08:20,259
guys don't want to listen to me dab and

248
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:22,089
cough into the microphone so I'm going

249
00:08:20,259 --> 00:08:24,129
to follow listener instructions I'm

250
00:08:22,089 --> 00:08:26,228
gonna take a gnarly dab and then I'll be

251
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:28,000
right back and I will talk about topping

252
00:08:26,228 --> 00:08:29,620
plants and then I will talk about my

253
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,250
minimal experience with deep water

254
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:32,769
culture

255
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:34,839
all right podcast rolled I am back I

256
00:08:32,769 --> 00:08:37,718
just took some gigantic dabs of lemon oh

257
00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:39,700
gee haze was bred by Colin at the ethos

258
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:41,860
collective it was grown by the crew at

259
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:44,740
Three Rivers and it was processed by our

260
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:46,659
friends over at the crafts great work to

261
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:48,700
everybody involved I really like the

262
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:51,219
flavor of that it was like a UH like

263
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:53,200
sort of a lemon I like the lemon candy

264
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:55,180
but not real overwhelming like a light

265
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,580
lemon candy like a diluted lemon candy

266
00:08:55,179 --> 00:08:58,838
almost but in a good way

267
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:00,009
sometimes too much lemon can be too much

268
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:01,839
lemon if you know what I mean

269
00:09:00,009 --> 00:09:03,220
it was really delicious I think the next

270
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,320
time I take a dab of it I'm going to

271
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:07,600
dunk it into these lemon Jeffrey Terps

272
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:09,670
I've got some lemon Jeffrey hi terpene

273
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,379
full spectrum extract but I have not

274
00:09:09,669 --> 00:09:12,610
finished so I think I'm gonna drop a

275
00:09:11,379 --> 00:09:14,620
little bit of that on there next time

276
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:18,480
really lemon it up and that way it'll be

277
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:20,679
too much lemon in a good way alright I

278
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,080
think I'm back I think I can answer a

279
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:25,149
question our listener sent an email

280
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:27,430
asking about topping let's talk about

281
00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:29,199
topping I could go on and on about

282
00:09:27,429 --> 00:09:31,329
topping cannabis plants but I will try

283
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,580
to keep it concise and stick to the

284
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:36,250
point topping our listener asked about

285
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:38,410
the best time for topping the time to

286
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:39,679
talk depends on your goal why are you

287
00:09:38,409 --> 00:09:42,079
topping

288
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:44,179
a lot of us are topping to create a

289
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:47,000
wider canopy that's what I'm topping for

290
00:09:44,179 --> 00:09:48,919
when you grow cannabis plants once it

291
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,049
starts branching out a little bit one

292
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:52,399
branch in the middle will take off way

293
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:54,859
higher than the others that's called

294
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:57,049
apical dominance that one plant that one

295
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:58,550
branch wants to be on top that is so

296
00:09:57,049 --> 00:10:00,289
when the pollen comes that that one

297
00:09:58,549 --> 00:10:02,059
branch is certain to get pollinated so

298
00:10:00,289 --> 00:10:03,649
that it can make seeds for the future

299
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:05,299
that's why you notice your male plants

300
00:10:03,649 --> 00:10:06,769
tend to be taller they're trying to

301
00:10:05,299 --> 00:10:08,299
shoot up top so that when they pollinate

302
00:10:06,769 --> 00:10:10,879
they can drop their pollen down under

303
00:10:08,299 --> 00:10:12,169
the girls below them so the tall parts

304
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:14,899
they're shooting up there so that they

305
00:10:12,169 --> 00:10:17,329
can get pollen or drop the pollen so you

306
00:10:14,899 --> 00:10:20,059
top them to take out that top main node

307
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:22,250
and then all of the leftover nodes will

308
00:10:20,059 --> 00:10:24,409
compete for top space but since you've

309
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:26,208
taken out that top if you do it right

310
00:10:24,409 --> 00:10:29,299
you've already created sort of a canopy

311
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:31,338
I'll lay a level an even layer of tops

312
00:10:29,299 --> 00:10:33,649
and they will all become your main tops

313
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:35,480
and then if you want to do it again you

314
00:10:33,649 --> 00:10:38,720
can top those also so let's talk about

315
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:41,000
timing of topping it kind of depends on

316
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,830
what you're trying to do based on when

317
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,139
you want to top the plant so what I like

318
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:47,120
to do is let the plant grow in about a

319
00:10:45,139 --> 00:10:49,100
four inch pot and then once it starts

320
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,620
getting tight into that I put it into a

321
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:53,570
three gallon pot with a soilless mix

322
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:54,679
it's usually a lot of cocoa a lot of

323
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:56,360
perlite in there and then it kind of

324
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:58,729
depends on where I am and what where I'm

325
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:00,440
working I depends on what I'm doing but

326
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:02,539
when I put it into that three gallon pot

327
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:04,250
it's starting to branch out while I'm

328
00:11:02,539 --> 00:11:06,049
transplanting all them I'll go through

329
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:08,419
and cut the top out of all of them so

330
00:11:06,049 --> 00:11:09,500
the plant should be I'm trying to make

331
00:11:08,419 --> 00:11:10,759
it measure with my hands that's about

332
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,169
twelve to eighteen inches tall it's

333
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:13,399
about sixteen inches it's a little

334
00:11:12,169 --> 00:11:16,429
longer than a drum stick so it's about

335
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:18,860
eighteen inches I guess about the top

336
00:11:16,429 --> 00:11:20,989
usually four to six inches of that is

337
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:22,879
going to be that main top note that I'm

338
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:24,649
talking about cutting out so I like to

339
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:26,778
grab that top branch and just work my

340
00:11:24,649 --> 00:11:28,610
way down and just run your hand down it

341
00:11:26,778 --> 00:11:30,110
and you can see where to cut just kind

342
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:31,850
of tip it over at a spa and say would

343
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:33,560
that make me even and you want to make

344
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:35,209
all the other tops you want to even them

345
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:36,979
out you can see where the other tops are

346
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:38,599
you've got like a crown like a little

347
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:40,519
menorah coming out you've got a bunch of

348
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,870
branches that even up maybe if you've

349
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:43,789
got a more stretchy plant you've only

350
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:45,860
got two of those coming up right so

351
00:11:43,789 --> 00:11:47,569
there's gonna be the top one and then

352
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:50,089
there's a node coming off the left and a

353
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:51,650
node coming off the right take off right

354
00:11:50,089 --> 00:11:53,610
before that left node just leave that

355
00:11:51,649 --> 00:11:54,929
left and right node if you take out that

356
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:56,789
piece right out of the middle you've

357
00:11:54,929 --> 00:11:59,009
officially talked that if you've got a

358
00:11:56,789 --> 00:12:01,139
branch here plant you can go down lower

359
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:02,490
and cut out until you make them all even

360
00:12:01,139 --> 00:12:05,159
just keep cutting out that Center one

361
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:07,379
now there are a lot of different ways to

362
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:09,179
do it I like to leave some space I

363
00:12:07,379 --> 00:12:10,679
recently I used to top two close

364
00:12:09,179 --> 00:12:11,159
together I would top tore those two

365
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:12,870
branches

366
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:15,059
we're just ving out real close together

367
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:16,500
you can do that if you're not going to

368
00:12:15,059 --> 00:12:18,209
grow a lot of plants in a tight space

369
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:21,059
I'm growing a lot of plants in a tight

370
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:22,920
space I go a little bit lower to create

371
00:12:21,059 --> 00:12:25,109
a little more space between my new tops

372
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:28,349
so you're mainly asking about timing

373
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:31,139
when do you want to top if you let that

374
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:33,779
let that top branch stop start to show

375
00:12:31,139 --> 00:12:35,759
itself that's when I top what my friend

376
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:37,919
sub cool does as soon as the plant is

377
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:39,929
big enough he tops as soon as it starts

378
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:41,339
showing its first Y section like this

379
00:12:39,929 --> 00:12:43,199
branch is gonna go off this way this

380
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:45,300
branch is gonna go off this way and the

381
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,920
plants got nice and sturdy now as soon

382
00:12:45,299 --> 00:12:48,629
as it looks sexy sub goes in there and

383
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:50,639
takes the top out of it it's kind of

384
00:12:48,629 --> 00:12:52,889
shocking it's a little bit brutal but

385
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:56,340
sub cool pulls mad weight off of his

386
00:12:52,889 --> 00:12:58,169
plants to his plants look like two of

387
00:12:56,340 --> 00:13:01,379
everybody else's plants cuz he topped

388
00:12:58,169 --> 00:13:03,329
them so early no if I did that method I

389
00:13:01,379 --> 00:13:05,309
would top them very small and I would

390
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:06,960
let them grow and I would reach op them

391
00:13:05,309 --> 00:13:08,579
once so you know you've made two

392
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:10,560
branches right now if you go back a

393
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:12,090
little later and top the tops of those

394
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:15,719
those will branch into two and now

395
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:17,310
you've got four main tops it depends on

396
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:19,950
what you want to do I'm pretty sure

397
00:13:17,309 --> 00:13:21,419
you're going to be spraga the trellis so

398
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:23,370
I would do the method where they grow

399
00:13:21,419 --> 00:13:25,139
out into a nice bush and then just take

400
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:27,210
that main top out of there to where

401
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:29,309
they're all even I experiment a little

402
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:31,110
go high cut out the top kind of high

403
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:33,029
besides you want to cut lower go a

404
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:35,070
little lower you can always cut more off

405
00:13:33,029 --> 00:13:37,199
but you can't put any back is something

406
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:39,600
you should always remember so when I'm

407
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:42,240
topping I'm topping to create an even

408
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,740
canopy if I've got 12 golden goat plants

409
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,090
that have all veg to the same length and

410
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,860
time they should all be about the same

411
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:48,540
amount of bushiness there's always that

412
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:50,519
one damn branch that sticks out of the

413
00:13:48,539 --> 00:13:51,959
top I go through and cut her out and I

414
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:54,269
cut a little bit lower than you would

415
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:55,889
imagine to make some space in my top so

416
00:13:54,269 --> 00:13:57,389
that when I put the trellis on them they

417
00:13:55,889 --> 00:13:59,309
spread out nice and evenly and I don't

418
00:13:57,389 --> 00:14:01,169
have that one goofy one sticking up real

419
00:13:59,309 --> 00:14:02,699
bad I'm you said that you were the

420
00:14:01,169 --> 00:14:04,649
trellis guy in the email so you're gonna

421
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:06,540
be trellising that's how I would do it

422
00:14:04,649 --> 00:14:07,259
for you so spread them out to create a

423
00:14:06,539 --> 00:14:10,199
canopy this

424
00:14:07,259 --> 00:14:13,080
give you a better yield so if you top

425
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:14,940
early you're gonna get these huge two

426
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:16,139
branches and then you're gonna get you

427
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:18,120
could top those again you're gonna have

428
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:19,590
four branches if you wait till it grows

429
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,210
up a little bit till you get that crown

430
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:23,399
that menorah and make that top one come

431
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:25,170
out you create a little bush that's what

432
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:28,110
I prefer so do the little bushy thing

433
00:14:25,169 --> 00:14:29,759
then put it under your scrog pull one of

434
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:31,529
those branches through every square of

435
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:33,269
your scrog and now you've started in a

436
00:14:31,529 --> 00:14:35,549
nice little canopy a nice little canopy

437
00:14:33,269 --> 00:14:38,009
will give you a nice yield one thing

438
00:14:35,549 --> 00:14:40,139
you're doing by topping you're taking

439
00:14:38,009 --> 00:14:41,669
out that main top a lot of people say

440
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:43,049
there goes your main cola yeah that

441
00:14:41,669 --> 00:14:44,969
thing was gonna grow up into the light

442
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:46,559
and get burnt it was gonna prevent you

443
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:48,000
from lowering the lights to get all of

444
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:50,099
those other buds a whole bunch of light

445
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,139
now you spread it out with the screen

446
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:55,230
you take out that main top you've got

447
00:14:52,139 --> 00:14:56,850
this nice little layer of buds all over

448
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:59,190
the place instead of having one giant

449
00:14:56,850 --> 00:15:01,259
cola if you've got a 5x5 space

450
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:03,330
you've probably got five by five worth a

451
00:15:01,259 --> 00:15:05,129
space worth of nice little buds that are

452
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:07,770
all the same size they look uniform and

453
00:15:05,129 --> 00:15:10,049
they're beautiful so top it throw down

454
00:15:07,769 --> 00:15:11,549
once a one screen let it grow for a few

455
00:15:10,049 --> 00:15:13,049
days into the other screen put the other

456
00:15:11,549 --> 00:15:15,599
screen depending on your space you know

457
00:15:13,049 --> 00:15:17,039
somewhere between sometimes we go only 6

458
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,930
inches apart with the screens depending

459
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:21,029
on what strain sometimes we go 10 to 12

460
00:15:18,929 --> 00:15:22,979
inches apart depending on what strain it

461
00:15:21,029 --> 00:15:25,439
is jack flash is a floppy little [ __ ]

462
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:27,570
jack flash you could put scrog nets up

463
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,250
every 6 inches all the way through the

464
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:32,520
whole canopy with Jack flash she's just

465
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:34,200
so floppy so ah top it get it under the

466
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:36,199
screen top it multiple times now here's

467
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:38,310
something that really matters a lot

468
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:41,190
after you've topped your plants give

469
00:15:38,309 --> 00:15:42,839
yourself at least 10 to 14 days to veg

470
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:44,940
those plants before you put them into

471
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:46,740
flower you just took out the main top of

472
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:48,990
those plants that held the main hormones

473
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:50,789
in that plant all of those branches have

474
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:51,899
to read aside who's gonna be the top now

475
00:15:50,789 --> 00:15:53,250
they're all gonna start growing up

476
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:55,079
acting like they're gonna be the tops

477
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:57,990
it's gonna work beautifully because now

478
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:59,340
you've got a nice even canopy so after

479
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:01,830
you've topped your plants give them at

480
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:03,870
least 10 to 14 days to recover from the

481
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:06,060
shock you just put them into before you

482
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:07,740
put them into flower if you don't you're

483
00:16:06,059 --> 00:16:09,509
only gonna grow little tiny buds out of

484
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:11,399
all those top sites that are not gonna

485
00:16:09,509 --> 00:16:13,409
perform the way you wish they'd would

486
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:15,179
that's the guy who says you just cut out

487
00:16:13,409 --> 00:16:16,980
your main kolja yeah he did probably

488
00:16:15,179 --> 00:16:18,870
didn't give his plants time to recover

489
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:20,909
after he did it he got little shitty

490
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:21,190
buds so if you're gonna top your plants

491
00:16:20,909 --> 00:16:23,379
get

492
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:25,900
yourself at least 10 days I would prefer

493
00:16:23,379 --> 00:16:28,000
14 days before you put them into flour

494
00:16:25,899 --> 00:16:30,220
now your main question was when to top

495
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,720
them that's kind of up to you when you

496
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:33,129
see them branching out the way that you

497
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:35,620
want them to branch out once they've got

498
00:16:33,129 --> 00:16:37,000
like four or five branches coming off of

499
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:38,350
them that are competing to be the tops

500
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,269
and you take out that main top they'll

501
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:41,710
really start branching so you can top

502
00:16:40,269 --> 00:16:43,480
them early when they're still in little

503
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:45,460
pots I like to do it when they start

504
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:47,110
getting the water branches and a nice

505
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:49,540
root ball I like to do it when they're

506
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:51,700
probably like I said about 16 maybe 18

507
00:16:49,539 --> 00:16:53,980
inches tall take out that main top bring

508
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:55,540
them back down to about 12 inches they

509
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:56,889
look really sexy when you do it to look

510
00:16:55,539 --> 00:16:59,169
all nice and even looks like you gave

511
00:16:56,889 --> 00:17:01,029
everybody a nice flat top so I don't

512
00:16:59,169 --> 00:17:02,139
know how fast your plants are going to

513
00:17:01,029 --> 00:17:03,610
grow I don't know how they're going to

514
00:17:02,139 --> 00:17:05,078
perform in your garden I don't know what

515
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:07,539
kind of lights you've got I don't know

516
00:17:05,078 --> 00:17:08,919
what kind of genetics you're using all I

517
00:17:07,539 --> 00:17:11,649
really know is that using deep water

518
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:13,689
culture and you're scrubbing it so top

519
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:16,360
it when it starts to get kind of branchy

520
00:17:13,689 --> 00:17:18,490
and i usually do it right about the time

521
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:20,679
I hop pot from a small pot to my

522
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:22,990
finishing pot which like I said is

523
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:25,390
usually a four by four Square pot or a

524
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:27,910
six-inch net pot into a three gallon pot

525
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:30,580
I'm always using a bunch of coco a bunch

526
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:32,350
of perlite maybe a soilless mix just

527
00:17:30,579 --> 00:17:33,970
depends on what facility I'm growing in

528
00:17:32,349 --> 00:17:36,369
if I'm at a commercial facility if I'm

529
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:39,190
at home if I'm breeding that's usually

530
00:17:36,369 --> 00:17:40,659
just why it varies so that's when I

531
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:42,130
would top you guys I hope that answered

532
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:44,650
your question I said I was gonna keep it

533
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:47,110
short and concise and I lied to you I

534
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:49,660
apologize for that alright now the next

535
00:17:47,109 --> 00:17:51,490
part of your question was for tips on

536
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:52,960
deep water culture and you know that I

537
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:54,789
don't personally grow deep water culture

538
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,829
so thanks for being gentle on me with

539
00:17:54,789 --> 00:17:58,690
that the couple of things I do note

540
00:17:56,829 --> 00:18:01,359
about deep water culture really do

541
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:03,850
matter one of them is pH you have got to

542
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:04,779
keep that pH under control the pH gets

543
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:07,839
too high or too low

544
00:18:04,779 --> 00:18:09,970
things can go wrong very quickly with

545
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:11,079
your deep water culture system maybe I

546
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:13,210
should talk about what a deep water

547
00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:14,679
culture system is real quick there are

548
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:17,440
different ways to do it but mostly

549
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:19,420
you've got a plant that is suspended in

550
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,220
a medium most of the time it starts off

551
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:23,500
with those little hydroton pebbles and a

552
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:26,170
small net pot and that sits in another

553
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:28,390
bucket usually and that bucket has a

554
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:31,179
sprayer on the bottom of it that sprays

555
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:33,009
a continuous spray to the bottom of the

556
00:18:31,179 --> 00:18:34,690
roots to keep them alive just through a

557
00:18:33,009 --> 00:18:35,049
spray instead of constantly sitting in

558
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:37,150
water

559
00:18:35,049 --> 00:18:39,250
or instead of sitting in a soil they're

560
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:41,320
getting oxygenated water all the time

561
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:43,059
spring up to them with nutrients in it

562
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:44,289
as well so they're getting oxygen

563
00:18:43,059 --> 00:18:47,379
they're getting plenty of nutrients

564
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:48,970
they're the roots grow [ __ ] rapidly

565
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:50,590
in a deep water culture system there are

566
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:52,539
a lot of ways to do it my explanation

567
00:18:50,589 --> 00:18:55,359
was very brief but you're basically

568
00:18:52,539 --> 00:18:57,009
hanging the roots over a sprayer the

569
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:58,689
little easy cloners that is basically

570
00:18:57,009 --> 00:19:00,700
the start of deep water culture deep

571
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:03,250
water culture is that you just go bigger

572
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:05,350
you can do it with multiple plants in

573
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:07,930
one thing the most common way I've seen

574
00:19:05,349 --> 00:19:09,039
it is one plant and one bucket like I

575
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:11,140
said you've got a five gallon bucket

576
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:13,180
maybe a seven gallon bucket with a lid

577
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:15,160
with a little like a modified hole into

578
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:17,470
it and then a net pot sits in that and

579
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:19,300
you put your hydroton or your pebbles

580
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:20,980
into that net pot and then you set a

581
00:19:19,299 --> 00:19:22,750
clone inside of there it's usually the

582
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:24,099
clone starts off in a rock will cube or

583
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:26,410
something to keep it balanced you set

584
00:19:24,099 --> 00:19:28,689
that in there you put a sprayer in there

585
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:30,460
it sprays up from the bottom and keeps

586
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:32,500
the roots wet at all times and those

587
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:34,720
roots just grow the roots grow like

588
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:37,299
crazy so what really matters in there is

589
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:39,490
the pH the pH and deep water culture is

590
00:19:37,299 --> 00:19:42,159
super important when you're drawing in

591
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:44,529
hydroponic mediums and methods the pH

592
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,850
and PPM's and timpz are much more

593
00:19:44,529 --> 00:19:48,430
important than when you're growing and

594
00:19:45,849 --> 00:19:49,929
like a soilless mix or in soil so it's

595
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:51,519
much more critical in a deep water

596
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:54,600
culture like everything else you've got

597
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:57,039
to keep the pH of your solution around

598
00:19:54,599 --> 00:20:00,669
the books all say the Internet all says

599
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:03,009
5.5 to 6.5 it's gonna be very plant

600
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:05,170
specific you'll notice that if you've

601
00:20:03,009 --> 00:20:06,970
got oh gee cushion one pot and super

602
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:09,279
Silver Haze in another pot that they're

603
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:11,589
going to want different PHS and you're

604
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:14,049
going to have to learn that about each

605
00:20:11,589 --> 00:20:15,699
plant depends on it just depends on your

606
00:20:14,049 --> 00:20:17,680
plant you guys so I would start off

607
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:19,539
maybe start off around six three and

608
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:21,640
maybe work your way down and if that

609
00:20:19,539 --> 00:20:24,220
doesn't seem to do it go back up you'll

610
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:26,560
have to learn how to identify pH issues

611
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:29,079
in your plants hopefully if you start

612
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:31,480
off around 6.3 you all have any problems

613
00:20:29,079 --> 00:20:33,519
I run a large commercial grow we usually

614
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:36,250
go about six to six point three on the

615
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:38,259
pH and that keeps we've got 43 different

616
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:41,200
strains somewhere between 40 and 50

617
00:20:38,259 --> 00:20:43,539
about 40 I'm gonna say 43 up guessing I

618
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:47,259
was about 40 43 different strains on our

619
00:20:43,539 --> 00:20:49,029
shelves right now and 6-2 6-3 keeps them

620
00:20:47,259 --> 00:20:50,349
all fairly happy

621
00:20:49,029 --> 00:20:51,369
I can tell that a couple like some of

622
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:53,259
the other things would like a little

623
00:20:51,369 --> 00:20:54,669
lower but I can't do it because the

624
00:20:53,259 --> 00:20:56,980
other plants would probably get pissed

625
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:59,590
off so make sure you get your pH dial

626
00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:02,230
then also your temperatures you want to

627
00:20:59,589 --> 00:21:04,659
be somewhere between like 67 and 72

628
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:06,130
degrees maybe just a little bit higher

629
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:07,690
would be okay but that's when you start

630
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:08,890
getting problems you don't want to go

631
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:10,360
too cold because the roots will get

632
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:12,310
shocked you want to go you don't want to

633
00:21:10,359 --> 00:21:15,159
go too high you'll start getting mildews

634
00:21:12,309 --> 00:21:17,169
so somewhere between like 67 and 72

635
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:19,240
degrees is ideal for your water

636
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:21,009
temperature the water temperature you've

637
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:23,259
got to keep the air around the plant a

638
00:21:21,009 --> 00:21:25,900
different temperature than the water

639
00:21:23,259 --> 00:21:27,190
temperature also the PPM's are very

640
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:29,860
important that's something you're going

641
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:31,930
to have to learn on a plant basis it'll

642
00:21:29,859 --> 00:21:35,169
be a strain specific plant by plant

643
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:37,539
specific basis on how many PPM's to feed

644
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:40,450
your plant never go too high I read

645
00:21:37,539 --> 00:21:42,099
often that like 1800 is too high but if

646
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:43,809
you know what you're doing you can push

647
00:21:42,099 --> 00:21:45,909
the limits I'm not telling you to go

648
00:21:43,809 --> 00:21:48,099
crazy don't feed them rocket fuel they

649
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:50,230
will burn um another thing we should

650
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:51,669
talk about is water quality check the

651
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:54,009
quality of the water you're starting

652
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:55,750
with if you've got a ppm meter an EC

653
00:21:54,009 --> 00:21:57,430
meter pH meter

654
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:59,380
why don't you ever check the water that

655
00:21:57,430 --> 00:22:01,480
you're starting with see what you are

656
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:03,370
working with I would recommend in a deep

657
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:04,329
water culture system I would recommend

658
00:22:03,369 --> 00:22:06,729
RO water

659
00:22:04,329 --> 00:22:08,829
I would buy an RO system a reverse

660
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:10,120
osmosis system that would give you

661
00:22:08,829 --> 00:22:12,039
enough water that you're gonna need

662
00:22:10,119 --> 00:22:14,409
however often you're gonna change these

663
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:16,599
buckets so quality of the water is

664
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:18,370
important start off with good water find

665
00:22:16,599 --> 00:22:20,109
out your ppm s find out how much [ __ ] is

666
00:22:18,369 --> 00:22:21,399
in that water before you start so that

667
00:22:20,109 --> 00:22:23,889
you can kind of do the math on what

668
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:26,050
you're putting in also now another thing

669
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:27,880
that I kind of mentioned is changing the

670
00:22:26,049 --> 00:22:29,409
water you're going to need to change the

671
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:31,840
water and clean out that deep water

672
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:33,430
culture bucket every so often I'm not

673
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:34,839
sure how much funk is going to build up

674
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:37,509
in your buckets but I would recommend

675
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:40,720
you change that water out at least once

676
00:22:37,509 --> 00:22:42,490
a week or every ten days at minimum the

677
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:45,279
way I would do it the way I have seen it

678
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:46,839
done instead of having just one five or

679
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:49,119
seven gallon bucket as your base it's

680
00:22:46,839 --> 00:22:51,789
really easy to have two of those as your

681
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:53,319
base so take the one that's got the pump

682
00:22:51,789 --> 00:22:54,909
and [ __ ] in there take that lid right

683
00:22:53,319 --> 00:22:56,710
off set your plant in the root ball

684
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:58,300
right inside that other bucket is a base

685
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:59,920
for a little bit you're gonna need to

686
00:22:58,299 --> 00:23:01,148
put some water in there because you need

687
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,919
weight to hold that plant

688
00:23:01,148 --> 00:23:04,628
I don't know if your roots are gonna get

689
00:23:02,919 --> 00:23:07,719
into that water or not if they do get

690
00:23:04,628 --> 00:23:09,398
into that water pH that water if the

691
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:10,778
roots are going to hang into it adjust

692
00:23:09,398 --> 00:23:12,848
the pH if the roots aren't gonna touch

693
00:23:10,778 --> 00:23:14,558
it you'll be just fine it's acting as a

694
00:23:12,848 --> 00:23:16,058
base it's in there for wait for support

695
00:23:14,558 --> 00:23:17,288
to hold that plant because you're

696
00:23:16,058 --> 00:23:18,608
putting weight at the top you don't want

697
00:23:17,288 --> 00:23:20,319
to top-heavy that's why the water's

698
00:23:18,608 --> 00:23:21,999
there that's a pro tip for you right

699
00:23:20,319 --> 00:23:23,439
before you [ __ ] up so take the other

700
00:23:21,999 --> 00:23:24,788
five-gallon bucket with some water set

701
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,679
the plant right inside there then take

702
00:23:24,788 --> 00:23:28,598
the one that you've been using and clean

703
00:23:26,679 --> 00:23:30,190
it get a sponge or something and clean

704
00:23:28,598 --> 00:23:31,778
that [ __ ] out just wipe it down real

705
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:33,190
good get a hose and hose it out if you

706
00:23:31,778 --> 00:23:34,628
can I understand a lot of you live in

707
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:36,999
apartments or whatever you can't do that

708
00:23:34,628 --> 00:23:38,978
just clean it out the best that you can

709
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:40,778
you want this clean if you can take some

710
00:23:38,979 --> 00:23:42,909
Faiz into it and scrub it out with five

711
00:23:40,778 --> 00:23:44,618
zen I would do that so get your bucket

712
00:23:42,909 --> 00:23:46,450
get anything that goes inside the bucket

713
00:23:44,618 --> 00:23:48,368
get it nice and clean fill it back up

714
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:49,690
with the appropriate appropriate amount

715
00:23:48,368 --> 00:23:51,189
of water so that when you plug in your

716
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:53,259
pump that it sprays to the bottom of the

717
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:54,759
roots fill it up the appropriate amount

718
00:23:53,259 --> 00:23:57,429
of water now put your nutrients in there

719
00:23:54,759 --> 00:23:59,319
put your if you're using a potassium

720
00:23:57,429 --> 00:24:02,200
silicon at that first add your base then

721
00:23:59,319 --> 00:24:04,509
add all your microbes then adjust the pH

722
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,798
if you need to then put that plant right

723
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:07,298
back into that main bucket that you

724
00:24:05,798 --> 00:24:08,918
started with it's all clean it's all

725
00:24:07,298 --> 00:24:11,200
brand new it's got all fresh nutrients

726
00:24:08,919 --> 00:24:12,788
into it I make sure the pH is cool the

727
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,558
PPM's are cool make sure the temperature

728
00:24:12,788 --> 00:24:16,210
is cool plug that [ __ ] back in and get

729
00:24:14,558 --> 00:24:17,469
her growing now another thing you're

730
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:19,149
gonna have to watch out for with deep

731
00:24:17,469 --> 00:24:21,580
water culture has those plants are

732
00:24:19,148 --> 00:24:23,048
growing to grow very quickly so make

733
00:24:21,579 --> 00:24:24,999
sure you don't wait too long to flower

734
00:24:23,048 --> 00:24:27,759
or you're going to run out of sealing

735
00:24:24,999 --> 00:24:29,200
space they're gonna go crazy all right

736
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:30,999
so just a couple of more quick small

737
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,399
tips before we wrap up the discussion on

738
00:24:30,999 --> 00:24:35,528
deep water culture if you do buy those

739
00:24:33,398 --> 00:24:37,268
pebbles that they use the hydroton clay

740
00:24:35,528 --> 00:24:38,888
pebbles rinsed the [ __ ] out of those

741
00:24:37,269 --> 00:24:41,079
things they're gross they're filthy

742
00:24:38,888 --> 00:24:42,728
put them in like a colander or something

743
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:43,928
and just run water through them and

744
00:24:42,729 --> 00:24:45,489
shake them and rinse the [ __ ] out of

745
00:24:43,929 --> 00:24:46,989
them they're really dirty they're really

746
00:24:45,489 --> 00:24:49,028
dusty if you start running those in your

747
00:24:46,989 --> 00:24:50,588
deep water culture buckets it's going to

748
00:24:49,028 --> 00:24:52,118
start mucking up your stuff it'll mess

749
00:24:50,588 --> 00:24:54,700
up your pH it'll mess with you all of

750
00:24:52,118 --> 00:24:57,488
your ppm readings clean that [ __ ] out of

751
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:58,899
there also check everything daily you're

752
00:24:57,489 --> 00:25:01,509
gonna have to check everything the

753
00:24:58,898 --> 00:25:03,548
equipment your pumps also check the pH

754
00:25:01,509 --> 00:25:05,229
and the PPM's make sure you get your

755
00:25:03,548 --> 00:25:07,048
temperatures and they're dialed in every

756
00:25:05,229 --> 00:25:09,098
day it doesn't need to change too much

757
00:25:07,048 --> 00:25:11,918
if you notice that the water is getting

758
00:25:09,098 --> 00:25:14,619
low add some water and make sure that

759
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:16,480
you reject the pH at that point if your

760
00:25:14,619 --> 00:25:18,039
kpmg it too high because the water does

761
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,259
evaporate just add a little bit of water

762
00:25:18,039 --> 00:25:21,779
in there until you get the PPM's back to

763
00:25:20,259 --> 00:25:24,940
where you want them don't go too high

764
00:25:21,779 --> 00:25:27,339
1600 1800 that's pretty high on ppm

765
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:28,830
levels make sure you check that you

766
00:25:27,339 --> 00:25:31,808
don't want to burn your plants um

767
00:25:28,829 --> 00:25:33,339
speaking of all of your pH in ppm and EC

768
00:25:31,808 --> 00:25:35,529
levels and all that good stuff and your

769
00:25:33,339 --> 00:25:36,730
temperatures calibrate your tools I

770
00:25:35,529 --> 00:25:38,859
don't know what kind of meters you're

771
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:40,960
using if you're using bluelab meters if

772
00:25:38,859 --> 00:25:43,079
you're using milwaukee meters i highly

773
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:46,480
suggest you invest in quality equipment

774
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:48,549
pH meters ec meters all that stuff

775
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:51,089
you're going to use it on a daily basis

776
00:25:48,549 --> 00:25:54,579
these are things that help you and sure

777
00:25:51,089 --> 00:25:57,189
healthy and happy plants so invest in

778
00:25:54,579 --> 00:25:59,579
quality meters use them daily check them

779
00:25:57,190 --> 00:26:02,620
very often calibrate them as needed and

780
00:25:59,579 --> 00:26:04,299
keep them clean also with a pH meter you

781
00:26:02,619 --> 00:26:05,619
guys always remember the rule if it

782
00:26:04,299 --> 00:26:07,659
dries it dies

783
00:26:05,619 --> 00:26:10,629
so keep the probe on your pH meter wet

784
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:12,490
at all times store it properly I see so

785
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:15,610
many people [ __ ] ruin their pH meters

786
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:16,990
by not keeping it wet all right I hope I

787
00:26:15,609 --> 00:26:18,849
gave you some useful advice there on

788
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:20,620
deep water culture I think I got some

789
00:26:18,849 --> 00:26:22,269
nuggets in there rinse those pebbles was

790
00:26:20,619 --> 00:26:24,219
probably a good trick to teach you and

791
00:26:22,269 --> 00:26:26,529
everybody needs to be reminded to

792
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:28,360
calibrate their meters occasionally also

793
00:26:26,529 --> 00:26:29,529
while you're calibrating your meters get

794
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:31,000
in there and clean out the filters on

795
00:26:29,529 --> 00:26:33,009
your air conditioners if you've got one

796
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,410
that's something that people quite often

797
00:26:33,009 --> 00:26:36,789
forget about all right you guys I'm

798
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:38,440
gonna start wrapping up this podcast

830
00:27:40,589 --> 00:27:44,549
could feel feeling the best you could

831

possibly feel it's pleasing and powerful

832
00:27:44,549 --> 00:27:48,779
its Irie when you're sitting on a maybe

833
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:51,269

00:27:48,779 --> 00:27:53,220
grassy hill underneath the tree got some

835

sunshine just a little bit of wind maybe

836

got my lady or my dog with me or maybe

837
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:59,490
both and it's not too bright and it's

838
00:27:57,809 --> 00:28:01,079
not too cold and it's just perfect and

839
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:03,210
the grass is kind of cool on your butt

840
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:04,710
and the grass feels nice on your toes

841
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:06,630
and there's nothing to worry about

842
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:08,940
there's a little breeze going on and

843
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:11,400
you're like ahhh and everything just

844
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:13,350
feels alright that's Irie that's when

845
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:16,440
you're feeling Irie everyone's got their

846
00:28:13,349 --> 00:28:18,179
own Irie space my Irie spaces are behind

847
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:19,860
a drum set I love playing some drums

848
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:21,180
that's when I get that feeling when

849
00:28:19,859 --> 00:28:23,159
everything just falls together on the

850
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:24,509
bass guitar is playing the guitar starts

851
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,920
strumming and the drums are right there

852
00:28:24,509 --> 00:28:27,329
and everything is just in the pocket and

853
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:29,370
all the people are dancing and loving it

854
00:28:27,329 --> 00:28:32,339
that's such an eerie feeling for me and

855
00:28:29,369 --> 00:28:34,679
then also growing breeding experiencing

856
00:28:32,339 --> 00:28:36,629
teaching loving cannabis that's always

857
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:39,509
been in high Refueling for me so it goes

858
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:40,980
hand in hand I read genetics see I did

859
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:42,660
wrap it all around I wasn't just off on

860
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:44,430
a random rant I read genetics on

861
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:45,810
Instagram I post a lot of cannabis

862
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:47,130
photography up there you guys I post

863
00:28:45,809 --> 00:28:49,079
probably two or three photos a day

864
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:51,120
depending on how hectic my day is I

865
00:28:49,079 --> 00:28:53,009
think that if you're into cannabis and

866
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:55,649
cannabis photography there's something

867

there that you would enjoy looking at if

868
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:58,769
there's something you'd like to say if

869
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,940
