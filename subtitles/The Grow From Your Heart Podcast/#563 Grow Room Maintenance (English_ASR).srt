35
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:18,959
talking about what i'm smoking

36
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:21,280
today i've been taking dabs of bananas

37
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:23,759
foster live batter from green dot labs

38
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,400
this is a blend of banana og and paris

39
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,159
larry

40
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,560
on the package the flavor is described

41
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,079
as banana sugar and oatmeal

42
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,359
i think i agree with those flavor

43
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:33,519
descriptions we have talked about the

44
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:35,920
banana fosters on the show before

45
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:36,640
i really enjoy the banana terps i think

46
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,640
i forgot

47
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,079
how much i enjoy banana turps not only

48
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,759
do i enjoy the flavor

49
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:43,118
of a banana strain but the buzz that

50
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,680
comes with it is really

51
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:46,319
desirable in my opinion so i'm really

52
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,640

104
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,120

107
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,318
i did include a link

108
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,120
in the show notes to make it nice and

109
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:22,560
easy

110
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,799
all right i think that covers most of

111
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,199
the business part of this episode

112
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,000
let's jump into this grow room

113
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:30,079
maintenance

114
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,519
checklist we spend a lot of money on

115
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,599
gear in the grove

116
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,360
we rely on all of that equipment to work

117
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:35,919
properly but it's not going to run on

118
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,280
its own

119
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:38,639
without a little bit of a checkup

120
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,840
without some maintenance without some

121
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:41,518
routine maintenance

122
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,039
so once in a while we need to think

123
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,158
about the moving parts in the grow and

124
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:45,759
maybe take care of them

125
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:47,199
update them a lot of things need

126
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:49,039
maintenance many things may need

127
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:50,158
replaced especially if you haven't been

128
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:51,519
doing maintenance

129
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:52,959
so what are some of the things in the

130
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,840
grow room that we really need to

131
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,840
maintain

132
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,759
i started thinking about this list uh

133
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,280
just by going through my day in the grow

134
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:01,039
in my head and thinking what are the

135
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,400
tools and equipment that i touch and

136
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:03,919
that i pay attention to

137
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,120
one of the first things that came to my

138
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:09,359
mind was my ph meter i use my ph meter

139
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,000
on a daily basis i've got multiple ph

140
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,560
meters

141
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,598
i've got a blue lab combo meter that's

142
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,598
stuck to the wall

143
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:18,478
the probes dangle into a reservoir i can

144
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:20,238
always see the ph the ec and the ppms

145
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:22,399
and the temperature in that reservoir at

146
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:24,478
all times i like that device

147
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:26,079
however sometimes i second guess my

148
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:27,439
equipment how do i know that that one

149
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:30,159
device is reliable

150
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:30,639
so i've got a second ph pin to double

151
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,199
check

152
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,879
my first ph pen i use the ph testing

153
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,280
solution i make sure that they all test

154
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:36,719
right

155
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:38,719
then i double check with two pins

156
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,199
occasionally i just want to double check

157
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,120
because ph is very important especially

158
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,280
to a cocoa grower somebody running a

159
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,519
hydro system your ph is going to be

160
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:49,918
very important so let's clean and

161
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:51,279
calibrate our ph meters on a regular

162
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:53,439
basis as a grower

163
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:54,719
your ph meter if you're a salt-based

164
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:57,279
grower if you're a coco

165
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,080
a hydro type grower your ph meter is

166
00:04:57,279 --> 00:04:59,839
like your

167
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:01,519
hammer or your saw if you were a

168
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:03,359
carpenter that is something you bust out

169
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:05,120
every day on a daily basis

170
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,479
you need your hammer and your saw to

171
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,439
work reliably

172
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:11,439
so let's get a good quality ph pen a

173
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:13,038
good quality ec meter

174
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:14,399
all the good quality meters that you can

175
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:15,759
get we don't want trash here we don't

176
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:17,758
want junk here

177
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,439
like i said in a previous episode i

178
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,680
believe you get what you pay for when it

179
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:24,319
comes to ph meters and ec meters

180
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,360
and testing devices so pay for those get

181
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:27,360
quality devices

182
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,800
then let's maintain them let's clean

183
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,160
them we need to clean the probes they

184
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,439
come with a cleaning solution if you

185
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,600
don't have it order a little bit of

186
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:36,639
cleaning solution it's not expensive

187
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,160
clean your probes recalibrate your ph

188
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,800
meters if you haven't been doing it

189
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,439
on at least a monthly basis i recommend

190
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,120
weekly

191
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:44,560
every monday just start the monday off

192
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,160
just by calibrating your meters it

193
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,199
doesn't take that much time and it feels

194
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,080
really good to know

195
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:52,160
that your gear is in top shape so clean

196
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:52,800
and calibrate your meters your ph pin

197
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,960
your ec

198
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,960
pen your ppm pen whatever you've got

199
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:58,799
clean and calibrate those bad [ __ ]

200
00:05:56,959 --> 00:06:00,879
now here is something that you may not

201
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,680
know i'm not sure that i knew this

202
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:04,959
when you acquire a new ph pen you are

203
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,160
supposed to soak

204
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:09,359
that pen in the storage solution the kci

205
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,160
storage solution

206
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,280
for 24 hours before you activate that

207
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,120
new ph pin

208
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:16,318
i've seen a lot of people get a new pen

209
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,399
pull it out of the box

210
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,000
dip it in calibration solution start

211
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:21,359
mixing solution and use that as their

212
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,038
calibration tool

213
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,120
uh that's not the way to do it we need

214
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:26,800
to take these pins out of the box

215
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,199
fill a most of them come with a little

216
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,520
cup fill that little cup with your kci

217
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,960
storage solution set the probe in there

218
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:35,680
for 24 hours

219
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:37,279
then after 24 hours use your 4 and 7 and

220
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,400
possibly some companies use other

221
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:40,559
calibration

222
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:42,159
standards but use your 4 and your 7 and

223
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,800
calibrate your device that way and then

224
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,520
rinse it off

225
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,199
then now you are ready to ph your

226
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:48,399
solution you can put it in your nutrient

227
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,840
solution and it will show you an

228
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:51,120
accurate reading but

229
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:52,560
those things don't come out of the box

230
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,160
ready to go they need some prep they

231
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,759
need some love we need to soak it

232
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,759
then we need to calibrate it so don't

233
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,360
forget those steps take good care of

234
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:02,000
your equipment and it will continue

235
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,038
to take good care of you another thing

236
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,680
keep that probe

237
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:07,598
on your ph pen moist if that probe dries

238
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,280
it dies the grower cries

239
00:07:07,598 --> 00:07:11,038
keep that [ __ ] wet because once it

240
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:11,918
goes dry you've got to buy a new one and

241
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:15,120
they are not

242
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:17,439
cheap good quality ph pins are expensive

243
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,800
the best way to remember to always keep

244
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:21,038
your ph pen moist

245
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,319
is to forget to moisten one you spend

246
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:25,199
130 bucks

247
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:27,039
it dries up it dies grower cries you got

248
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,680
to spend another 130 bucks at the grow

249
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:29,120
store

250
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,800
blue lab is happy with you the guy at

251
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,639
the groce store is excited but you're at

252
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,280
130 bucks because you let that [ __ ]

253
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,879
dry

254
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:36,159
all right let's keep moving another

255
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:36,879
thing that i think about we need to

256
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,039
maintain

257
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:40,000
is cleaning all of the filters what kind

258
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:41,598
of filtration

259
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,038
do you have in your grow room do you

260
00:07:41,598 --> 00:07:46,478
have an air conditioner

261
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:48,399
i have got a 14 000 btu rolling air

262
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:48,800
conditioner with a filter in the back of

263
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:50,878
it

264
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,960
that thing needs cleaned about every two

265
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,360
weeks it gets sticky it gets dusty in

266
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:55,359
there

267
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,960
it's got a filter in it pop that filter

268
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,800
out take it to where there's a sink and

269
00:07:56,959 --> 00:08:00,719
just hose it down then let it dry

270
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,720
then put it back clean out that filter

271
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,879
that will increase airflow that will

272
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,160
decrease restriction air restriction on

273
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:07,919
your air conditioner which makes

274
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,319
the air conditioner work harder which

275
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:11,359
makes it last less time if we maintain

276
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,879
these devices

277
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,598
they will last longer for us we need

278
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,879
this gear to last money is expensive

279
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:18,240
we're not making a lot of money on

280
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,680
growing cannabis these days because

281
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,000
everybody's growing cannabis

282
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,759
every dollar and every gram counts so

283
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,639
maintain the gear we've got with the

284
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,879
time we've got

285
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,800
and make this gear stick around so clean

286
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,439
the filters and your air conditioner

287
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,680
clean the filters in your humidifier and

288
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:35,759
dehumidifier those should be done

289
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:37,278
probably every three to five maybe seven

290
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:39,120
days but if you haven't done it

291
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:40,879
get in there and do it and add that [ __ ]

292
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,320
to your task list put that on your

293
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:44,399
general maintenance list

294
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,160
clean the filters on the humidifier and

295
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,839
dehumidifier

296
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:48,958
check them they're probably gunky if you

297
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,480
haven't cleaned them in a while they're

298
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:53,039
probably gross

299
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,800
other things to check out the ro filter

300
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:56,480
if you're running reverse osmosis or if

301
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:57,439
you've got a big boy filter or a small

302
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,200
boy filter

303
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,880
are those filters in there are they any

304
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,759
good is your membrane any good in your

305
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:03,200
filtration

306
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:04,958
are you just running water through a

307
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,399
device and wasting time and not really

308
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:06,799
cleaning it and thinking you're cleaning

309
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,320
it

310
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:10,079
are those is it time to change those

311
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,959
filters is that due

312
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:15,120
also irrigation filters in a commercial

313
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:15,599
environment i run a big reservoir with a

314
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,919
pump

315
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,839
that goes up a bunch of pvc tubing in

316
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:21,439
one point of that pvc tubing

317
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:24,000
there's a straight line going up and a

318
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,440
filter that hangs down at a 45 degree

319
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,200
angle going down

320
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,959
the idea is that the heavy sediments

321
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,920
will fall into that filter and the water

322
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:31,679
will keep moving

323
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:33,039
so that by the time my water gets to the

324
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:35,359
end of the line it doesn't clog up my

325
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:38,159
emitters with chunky nutrient dust

326
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,839
those filters need to be cleaned often

327
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:41,439
depending on what we feed if we mix up

328
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,440
certain nutrients we have to clean that

329
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,279
[ __ ] filter while we are feeding but

330
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,200
most of the time it's a once every

331
00:09:45,278 --> 00:09:49,039
couple of days once a week sort of thing

332
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,879
if you haven't cleaned that filter now

333
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:52,399
is the time get in there and clean that

334
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:54,879
[ __ ] it's the first of the month

335
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,240
it's monday let's get in there and clean

336
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:57,519

00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,759
stuff clean all your stuff you guys

342
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:09,439
clean all of the things that have

343
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:11,278
filters in there clean out your

344
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,920
reservoirs do you have a reservoir where

345
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:14,320
you've got

346
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:15,519
50 gallons of water 200 gallons of water

347
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,440
just 10 gallons

348
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,519
dump that [ __ ] out and give it a good

349
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,440
scrubbing let it dry

350
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,039
if you use any sort of a cleaner make

351
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,480
sure that you rinse out all of that

352
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:26,159
cleaner no matter what it is if it's

353
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,879
faisan if it's simple green if it's

354
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:28,958
bleach

355
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:30,078
make sure you remove all of that cleaner

356
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:32,319
from your reservoir

357
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:34,479
clean it out let it dry rinse it out

358
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,079
again then you can reuse it but clean

359
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,759
that res we don't need ship building up

360
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:40,159
on the reservoir

361
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:40,958
also another thing you need to clean is

362
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:43,039
the pump

363
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:45,039
many of us are using many different

364
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:46,319
styles of pumps we've got hydro pumps

365
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:47,919
we've got mix pumps

366
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,680
lots of pumps going on many of those

367
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:51,199
pumps have little filters in them

368
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:52,719
many of those pumps have little moving

369
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,720
parts take it apart

370
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,560
get a toothbrush clean that [ __ ] out i

371
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,079
know it sounds tedious but

372
00:10:56,559 --> 00:11:00,319
do you want your grow room to be a

373
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:00,958
ferrari or do you want it to be a 92

374
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,800
prelude

375
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:04,879
you've got the opportunity to make the

376
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:06,958
grow room the ferrari if you take care

377
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:09,519
of it it will never run like a ferrari

378
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:10,958
if you put [ __ ] prelude care and love

379
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,078
into it if you got one of them preludes

380
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:13,439
it's just balling out there

381
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:14,719
no disrespect but you know what i'm

382
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,160
talking about that dude with the primer

383
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,720
gray prelude that's [ __ ] falling

384
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:18,399
apart

385
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,160
you didn't take care of it it's falling

386
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,519
apart now if you got that ferrari

387
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:23,600
every day you're tinkering on that

388
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,440
ferrari making sure that every corner is

389
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,800
polished and buffed the rims look shiny

390
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,399
the undercarriage is clean

391
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:30,719
you're making sure that ferrari is well

392
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,159
maintained there's oil level is perfect

393
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,920
brake fluid is perfect

394
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:35,360
muffler fluid is perfect you got it all

395
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:37,439
going just the way you need it let's

396
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,680
make our grow rooms [ __ ] ferraris

397
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,600
uh then we can win the race another

398
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:43,278
thing i see people forgetting to clean

399
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,720
especially in a commercial environment

400
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:47,039
is the measuring

401
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,240
cups which we measure our nutrients i

402
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,759
don't know what size of a grill you're

403
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,278
working with you may have a shot glass

404
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:52,879
you measure 20 milliliters

405
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:54,480
you may have a like a small pitcher you

406
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:56,240
measure 100 milliliters

407
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,159
whatever device you are pouring your

408
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,360
nutrient solution from the bottle into

409
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:01,679
this measuring cup

410
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,360
let's clean the measuring cup why not

411
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:05,359
it's probably got some nutrient stains

412
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,039
on it it's got different colors on it

413
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,399
are those salts mixing into the other

414
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:10,399
nutrients you're pouring in there

415
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,919
did bottle a just mix in with bottle b

416
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,278
and then bottle c mixed with a

417
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:15,039
and b what are you doing to your

418
00:12:13,278 --> 00:12:17,039
nutrient solution let's clean

419
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:19,039
those mixing cups it's really not that

420
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:20,319
hard while we're cleaning those mixing

421
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:23,278
cups let's also

422
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,560
calibrate the scale which we may use to

423
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:26,480
measure dry

424
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:28,239
powdered nutrients if you're using veg

425
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,600
bloom you weigh those nutrients out by

426
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,278
the gram they're powdered you don't need

427
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,519
to you don't do milliliters or whatever

428
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:35,039
you put it on a scale and you do two

429
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,560
five grams if it's the base you're doing

430
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:38,319
five grams per gallon if it's

431
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:39,759
shine you're probably doing two it's

432
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,560
plus life you're probably doing one gram

433
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:42,720
per gallon

434
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:44,319
we've got a scale let's clean the scale

435
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,519
off i see those scales covered in

436
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,879
nutrients and it's gross

437
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,240
let's just clean that [ __ ] up get a

438
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:49,838
paper towel get some cleaner and just

439
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,200
clean that bad [ __ ] up get a rag if

440
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:52,399
you're not a paper towel kind of guy

441
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,240
i get it someone's going to give me

442
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,720
feedback i mean i noticed as soon as i

443
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,799
said that

444
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,079
but let's clean up that scale let's also

445
00:12:56,799 --> 00:12:59,838
calibrate the scale

446
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:01,039
we've calibrated our ph pens we've

447
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:02,880
calibrated everything else let's

448
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:04,078
calibrate the scale it's real easy

449
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:06,159
most of the scales come with the

450
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:06,479
calibration weight keep that handy have

451
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:08,240
that

452
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,920
next to your msds sheet or something to

453
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,519
where you could just grab it measure

454
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:13,199
make sure it weighs right make sure it's

455
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,000
accurate go back to work measure your

456
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,720
nutrients

457
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,039
we're measuring 5 grams per gallon if

458
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,720
you've got 20 gallons that's 100 grams

459
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:22,480
if you're just a little bit off you can

460
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,160
end up with 110 grams and that could

461
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,120
actually have seriously adverse effects

462
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:26,719
on the plants or

463
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,560
you could give them 90 grams and the

464
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,879
plants are going to be starving

465
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:32,239
so make sure that you calibrate and

466
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:34,799
clean up the scale

467
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,000
if you are using a scale for dry

468
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:37,199
nutrients

469
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,039
we're going to move on a little bit to

470
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,320
things that i see in the grow actual

471
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:42,399
grow space

472
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,839
a lot of growers have lights these are

473
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:45,120
old school but a lot of people are still

474
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,160
doing them some of the breeders still

475
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,919
use these

476
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:50,078
you've got a light with a vented hood

477
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:51,919
with glass between the bulb

478
00:13:50,078 --> 00:13:54,399
and the canopy of your plant so you got

479
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:56,078
basically a big metal shoe box with

480
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,879
glass on the bottom so that the bulb is

481
00:13:56,078 --> 00:13:58,479
inside there

482
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:59,919
and it shines down through the glass and

483
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,199
then you put ducting on both ends and

484
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:02,719
you can run air over it

485
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:04,078
that way the heat from your bulb doesn't

486
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,600
go down to your plants it just gets

487
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:06,958
blown right away by the ducting

488
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,959
it stays inside there because of the

489
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:11,039
glass that glass gets

490
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:12,399
really dirty let's clean that glass you

491
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:14,159
guys there are

492
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:15,759
pesticide sprays stuck to it there are

493
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:17,600
dead bugs stuck to it

494
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:19,838
there's hair stuck to it let's clean

495
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,519
those turn them off let them cool

496
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:23,199
because they're hot those lights have

497
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,839
been running don't forget the lights are

498
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:25,439
hot

499
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,880
unplug them let them cool for a little

500
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,560
while get a little bit of a wind some

501
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:30,559
windex or some kind of a cleaner

502
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:32,000
on a rag or a paper towel or a newspaper

503
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:33,838
however you do it just clean those

504
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,440
those pieces of glass in there that is

505
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,760
reducing your light

506
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:40,000
by so much percent i'm gonna say that

507
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:41,759
glass probably cuts down your light by

508
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,278
five to fifteen percent that's a guess

509
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:44,958
i'm really not a scientist when it comes

510
00:14:43,278 --> 00:14:46,078
to light but then for every little

511
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:48,399
speckle of

512
00:14:46,078 --> 00:14:49,679
pesticide spray or foliar spray or every

513
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,679
bug on there you're losing

514
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:53,278
two three five more percent and you're

515
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:54,000
paying for it you're still plugging that

516
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:55,519
light in

517
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,039
it's still cranking out electricity it's

518
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,799
still pumping out light

519
00:14:57,039 --> 00:15:01,120
maybe you're not getting as much light

520
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:02,719
over the canopy as you thought

521
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,000
let's keep moving i've got a lot to try

522
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,040
to cover that's why i'm talking kind of

523
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,198
fast here

524
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:08,958
um check all of the moving parts i don't

525
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:10,719
know what else you've got in your grow

526
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:12,799
anything that makes noise that words

527
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,399
that moves around the fans are the fans

528
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:15,679
clicking is one of them wobbling do they

529
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,159
oscillate properly

530
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:19,599
check all of that stuff do a safety

531
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:21,198
check is there something for your dreads

532
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,720
to get caught up on is there some corner

533
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:24,159
for you to get snagged on is there a

534
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,519
sharp spot on a table

535
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:27,198
is there a stick for you to poke your

536
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,879
eye on do that kind of maintenance

537
00:15:27,198 --> 00:15:30,078
and just set yourself up for success so

538
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:30,639
you don't have to slow down in the

539
00:15:30,078 --> 00:15:31,919
future

540
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:33,680
when you got your hands full and you're

541
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:35,360
in a rush take the time now to put some

542
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:36,719
duct tape on that sharp corner

543
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,480
maybe clean up that stuff you're gonna

544
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,240
trip on that's more of a cleanliness

545
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,519
episode but check out all the moving

546
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,519
parts we've got air conditioners

547
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:45,519
humidifiers dehumidifiers

548
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:47,440
we've got a ton of stuff to check on

549
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,679
anything that's moving that's got parts

550
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,279
check on it listen to it sometimes i can

551
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:52,719
hear the dehumidifier making the wrong

552
00:15:51,278 --> 00:15:55,198
noise it's way up there and i can hear

553
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,600
it the rhythm should be

554
00:15:55,198 --> 00:15:57,599
but sometimes

555
00:15:59,278 --> 00:16:02,078
that means something went wrong we need

556
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:03,039
to check on it pay attention to that

557
00:16:02,078 --> 00:16:06,559
kind of [ __ ]

558
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:08,639
um check outside for light leaks

559
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:10,479
if you're growing at home just walk

560
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,399
around walk around the house

561
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,240
walk around the building look for light

562
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,879
leaks do you see any signs that there is

563
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,639
a grow

564
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:18,320
inside the building is there light

565
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,919
reflecting through your ducting is there

566
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,120
light reflecting through some weird spot

567
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:22,639
you didn't think of

568
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,320
can you see the light at all can you

569
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:25,120
hear any of your equipment outside that

570
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,360
would tell

571
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,480
thieves snitches or cops that you've got

572
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,000
something going on

573
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,000
that's part of the maintenance routine

574
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,679
walk around the building walk outside

575
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,879
and check for light leaks

576
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:38,479
um is your carbon filter working

577
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:40,320
that's another important thing to think

578
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:43,278
about is your odor control

579
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:45,040
actually controlling odor sometimes i

580
00:16:43,278 --> 00:16:47,198
can walk into a commercial cultivation

581
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:48,639
facility and i don't even smell herb i'm

582
00:16:47,198 --> 00:16:50,399
around cannabis so much

583
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,159
my nose is blank to it that's just like

584
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:54,480
smelling normal air to me

585
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:56,078
so i don't smell ganja i've driven away

586
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,560
from my house before and i've come home

587
00:16:56,078 --> 00:16:59,679
and went

588
00:16:56,559 --> 00:17:01,599
oh [ __ ] i need a new carbon filter so

589
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:03,599
make sure your carbon filter is working

590
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,759
you may need to leave for a full day

591
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,679
go away for the entire day because your

592
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:08,078
nose is [ __ ] up you smell your skunk

593
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,079
weed

594
00:17:08,078 --> 00:17:11,678
you don't even notice it go away for the

595
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:13,599
day come back when you walk in the house

596
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,400
really pay attention do i smell my own

597
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,240
ganja

598
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,000
if you smell it other people can smell

599
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,519
it because you're accustomed to

600
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,439
it and if you can smell it it's out of

601
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:22,000
control you need a new carbon filter i

602
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,079
think

603
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,240
many companies say they last two years

604
00:17:24,078 --> 00:17:27,918
depending on how moist the room is

605
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,599
how much air you've been blowing through

606
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:31,038
it how well you took care of it

607
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:32,399
how i don't know did you jostle it

608
00:17:31,038 --> 00:17:33,919
around when you moved it there are so

609
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,240
many contributing factors

610
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:38,240
a good one should last about 18 months a

611
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,480
crappy one will last you maybe a year

612
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,160
if they're really good maybe two years i

613
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,759
only trust mine for about 18 months

614
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,640
because i don't need that stink going

615
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:47,440
out of the house

616
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:49,440
so check on your carbon filter excuse me

617
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,120
for clearing the throat here

618
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,759
check on all of the moving parts check

619
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:56,319
on all your gear then let's move into

620
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:56,960
uh part of a maintenance routine is also

621
00:17:56,319 --> 00:17:58,480
ordering

622
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,640
supplies what else are we going to need

623
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,360
this month it's so much easier to order

624
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,200
everything

625
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:04,558
in one shot and get one delivery or if

626
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,440
you're going to the store it's so much

627
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:06,879
easier to go there

628
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,240
i order for a commercial warehouse i

629
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,280
can't go pick it up in the car we get

630
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,720
trucks delivered so

631
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:13,038
my mindset's a little bit different but

632
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,079
do one order every month if you can that

633
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:14,640
way you don't have to go to the grow

634
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:16,319
store

635
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,160
too many times and be seen there too

636
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:19,439
much every time you're there you're

637
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,960
going to make an impulse buy and buy

638
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,960
some dumb [ __ ] you didn't need

639
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,640
also every time you're there you're

640
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,558
exposing yourself to other people who

641
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,400
grow who probably have spider mites or

642
00:18:26,558 --> 00:18:28,798
pollen or powdery mildew or something on

643
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,880
them

644
00:18:28,798 --> 00:18:32,000
also you're exposing yourself to a sales

645
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,120
guy who's going to sell you some [ __ ]

646
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
you don't need and change your whole

647
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:35,119
strategy

648
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,960
and also you're going to find other

649
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:37,279
growers that are going to give you ideas

650
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,038
and

651
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:40,399
sway you from doing what you're doing

652
00:18:39,038 --> 00:18:41,599
and you're doing your thing it's cool to

653
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,440
get more input but

654
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:44,879
don't let that grow store going seeing

655
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,640
all that fantastical [ __ ]

656
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,160
don't let it blow your mind and sway you

657
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,720
from your original goal you're doing

658
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,960
fine

659
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,640
so minimal trips to the growth store and

660
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,319
we can do that by making a nice list

661
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,840
what do we need to get we need nutrients

662
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:56,480
we know we're always going to need

663
00:18:55,839 --> 00:18:58,159
nutrients

664
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,519
every week every month we need to feed

665
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,759
the plants

666
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:04,000
a good responsible grower plans their

667
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:05,038
feed for almost the entire grow before

668
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,480
the growth starts

669
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:08,640
i know what the plants are going to get

670
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,720
through veg weeks one through three

671
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,160
weeks three through five and six through

672
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,960
nine i know what i'm feeding

673
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,679
every day to those plants so i can go to

674
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,600
the store and buy

675
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:19,280
all of those bottles in one shot i don't

676
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:21,199
have to go back makes it

677
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:22,558
very easy for me and the grocer loves it

678
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,200
because i don't have to go bother them

679
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:25,038
again

680
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,400
so think about all the nutrients you're

681
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:27,919
going to need have a strategy

682
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,080
go to the grow store get all those

683
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:31,600
nutrients in one shot also

684
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:33,439
get all of your pesticides and

685
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:34,159
fungicides in one shot think about what

686
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,919
you're going to get

687
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,360
you should already have a strategy

688
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,240
before you're even far enough into the

689
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:40,159
grow to need

690
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,000
pesticides and fungicides have a

691
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,000
strategy purchase the products

692
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,919
have them ready go shake the bottles are

693
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,798
your bottles low if they get this low i

694
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,960
need to order more

695
00:19:46,798 --> 00:19:50,720
order more of that [ __ ] so make a list

696
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,840
order your pesticides i always recommend

697
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,079
having three

698
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:55,038
different pesticides on hand i know that

699
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:57,599
sounds weird

700
00:19:55,038 --> 00:19:59,200
but the bugs don't like a rotation if

701
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:00,159
i've got three different pesticides they

702
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,880
don't know if i'm gonna throw an

703
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,720
uppercut

704
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,400
a left hook or a right cross they have

705
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,880
no idea what the [ __ ] to look for

706
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,840
i can eradicate bugs quite quickly also

707
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,840
i keep one

708
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:11,678
fungicide on deck at all times as well

709
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:12,319
if i see a powdery mildew situation or

710
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:14,240
something

711
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:16,000
i've already got the products here to

712
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:19,120
get rid of it so be prepared

713
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,679
also gloves and personal protective

714
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:23,279
equipment buying gloves here and there

715
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:25,200
gets expensive if you can buy enough

716
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:25,678
gloves to last you the month that is

717
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,240
much

718
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:29,280
more cost effective and again if you're

719
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,960
getting it online

720
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:33,119
less amazon shipments if you're going to

721
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:35,120
the store less visits to the store

722
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:36,479
get your gloves your personal protective

723
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:37,519
equipment if you're spraying you need a

724
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,159
tyvek suit

725
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:41,279
if you need respirator cartridges those

726
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:43,520
are hard to get right now

727
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:44,480
honestly uh the respirator cartridges

728
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:47,200
are on back order

729
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,400
everywhere uh so respirator cartridges

730
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,840
hopefully you got a couple of those

731
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,360
stocked up for your grow but

732
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:53,599
get all the personal protective

733
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:54,639
equipment another thing we should think

734
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:56,879
about is

735
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,400
how long have those bulbs been in that

736
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,880
grow room if you're running conventional

737
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,798
bulbs like hbs or metal halide bulbs

738
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,400
they don't last forever it is time to

739
00:21:02,798 --> 00:21:06,158
change them i always

740
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,440
write down when i put new bulbs in a

741
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:09,039
room i've got a spot where i keep

742
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,880
documentation for the grow

743
00:21:09,038 --> 00:21:12,558
so i'll put in a commercial grow here's

744
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,039
how i do it i will write on a piece of

745
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:16,960
duct tape new bulbs on january 1st and i

746
00:21:15,038 --> 00:21:18,000
put that piece of duct tape on the door

747
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,558
to the grow room

748
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,200
it's very obvious these bulbs january

749
00:21:20,558 --> 00:21:23,918
1st

750
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,120
so in the determined amount of time my

751
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:26,960
determined amount of time

752
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:28,319
and the owner and investors determined

753
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,360
amount of time for changing bulbs are

754
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:30,960
always different

755
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:32,479
uh they don't want to buy bulbs until

756
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,919
it's [ __ ] dark in the grow they don't

757
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,079
realize that those bulbs are

758
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:38,320
still sucking up 100 of the electricity

759
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:40,240
but not putting out 100 of the light

760
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:41,839
because the bulbs are dying so they

761
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,279
don't [ __ ] want to buy new bulbs

762
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:44,879
until the harvest comes

763
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:46,399
and they realize why didn't we pull as

764
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,840
much as we did last time and you say

765
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,280
the bulbs are shot we're not getting as

766
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:50,319
much light as we did and they go oh

767
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:51,678
really it would have made that much

768
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:53,519
difference we'll buy bulbs now

769
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:55,600
and you had to show them the hard way so

770
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:57,359
how long have your bulbs been in your

771
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:58,798
grow is it time to swap those out

772
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:00,399
did you use a par meter did you do

773
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:01,519
anything to document how much light

774
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,038
you're getting and how much light you're

775
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:04,720
getting now did you write down the day

776
00:22:03,038 --> 00:22:06,558
that those bulbs were put in there

777
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,400
maybe it's time to get new bulbs mark

778
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:09,038
down the day and start fresh with a good

779
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,640
idea

780
00:22:09,038 --> 00:22:12,720
because like i said when you plug in

781
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,159
that ballast that electricity happens it

782
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,759
gets generated it gets moved down the

783
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:16,400
cable it gets put into your [ __ ]

784
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:17,919
socket

785
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,759
it tries to come out of the light it's

786
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,960
still giving it a thousand watts if your

787
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:22,240
bulb's only going

788
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,240
i'm burned out i'm gonna put out like

789
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,759
700 watts you're ripping yourself off

790
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,599
for 30

791
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:29,200
you're still paying for it the electric

792
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:29,678
company doesn't go oh your harvest was

793
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,759
light

794
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:32,798
we'll give you a break they don't give

795
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:35,119
half of a [ __ ]

796
00:22:32,798 --> 00:22:37,119
so make sure your light bulbs are in

797
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:38,639
good condition if you're using leds

798
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:40,319
those should last for quite a while but

799
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,960
they will degrade over time

800
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:44,079
you have a much longer life span on your

801
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,600
leds

802
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:47,918
what else are we gonna talk about mop

803
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:49,279
heads and stuff like that order cleaning

804
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:50,960
supplies

805
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:52,558
many of you overlook how important

806
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,519
cleanliness is in your grow room and you

807
00:22:52,558 --> 00:22:55,759
just kind of half-ass

808
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:56,798
that let's stop that [ __ ] it's the first

809
00:22:55,759 --> 00:22:58,240
of the month let's get in there and

810
00:22:56,798 --> 00:22:59,200
clean all that [ __ ] up and start off

811
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,240
with a fresh

812
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:04,080
clean month you may need new mop heads i

813
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,159
am certain that you need trash bags

814
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:07,678
maybe you need another dedicated trash

815
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:09,280
can for the grow area

816
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:11,120
that you can just set right there and

817
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:12,960
not have to go chasing down a trash bag

818
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:16,000
all the time have a trash can

819
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:18,000
prepared to go also do you need to order

820
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,440
more rags or paper towels or whatever

821
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,279
you use to clean stuff

822
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,798
also do you have a bunch of newspapers

823
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:24,079
on hand so when you spill something

824
00:23:22,798 --> 00:23:25,839
you can just go grab a stack of old

825
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:27,359
newspaper and stack those newspapers on

826
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:27,839
the wetness and it'll suck it all up for

827
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:29,759
you

828
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:31,918
that is a grow trick from way back in

829
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:32,400
the day keep all the old newspapers in a

830
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:34,000
pile

831
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,759
if you spill some liquids drop the

832
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,319
newspaper on there newspaper will clean

833
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:39,279
it right up

834
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:40,879
it was free throw it away not a big deal

835
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:41,599
another thing you may need to stock up

836
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,679
on

837
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:45,759
if you can find it i highly recommend

838
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:49,278
that you get some isopropyl alcohol

839
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:50,798
i like to clean my [ __ ] with 91 iso

840
00:23:49,278 --> 00:23:52,640
it's hard as [ __ ] to find right now

841
00:23:50,798 --> 00:23:55,359
during these weird pandemic times

842
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,960
uh isopropyl alcohol will hit the shelf

843
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:58,639
and it is frenzied over

844
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,319
and it is a melee people put in the

845
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,200
carts and it's gone i usually grab about

846
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:02,558
six bottles

847
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,720
try to keep them stacked up on top of

848
00:24:02,558 --> 00:24:06,399
the fridge if you can get some isopropyl

849
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,480
alcohol for cleaning your equipment

850
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,440
that is gold that's going to be useful

851
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,038
for many

852
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,320
many cleaning applications of the grill

853
00:24:11,038 --> 00:24:13,519
you can clean your scissors with it when

854
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:15,119
you're cutting clones

855
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:16,960
you can clean your scissors with it when

856
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:18,479
you're trimming i like to have some iso

857
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,960
around i also like to clean the rigs

858
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,400
with it

859
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,720
so when you're ordering supplies and

860
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,559
[ __ ] try to get yourself some iso

861
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,798
uh you may need to go hit the smaller

862
00:24:24,558 --> 00:24:28,319
stores if walmart doesn't have it i hate

863
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:28,639
walmart i don't go to walmart i would

864
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:30,558
much

865
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,000
prefer walgreens but sometimes you got

866
00:24:30,558 --> 00:24:35,119
to go all over the place looking for

867
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,558
iso right now so order all of your stuff

868
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:37,439
that's part of the maintenance on the on

869
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:39,278
the first you got to

870
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,840
check all of the equipment any moving

871
00:24:39,278 --> 00:24:43,440
parts anything that squeaks rattles runs

872
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:45,439
anything that takes water anything that

873
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,120
takes a filter maintenance all of that

874
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,759
gear like i said before all of the

875
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:49,599
equipment

876
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:51,679
is expensive and it will last much

877
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:53,839
longer if we just give it some love

878
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:55,360
every occasionally once a week once

879
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:57,278
every two weeks once a month

880
00:24:55,359 --> 00:24:58,959
as often as it needs make sure you check

881
00:24:57,278 --> 00:24:59,759
on your equipment once you've checked on

882
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,200
all the equipment

883
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:02,879
how are your nutrients and supplies

884
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,159
doing you don't want to run out of [ __ ]

885
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,919
you don't want to be cutting clones and

886
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:07,600
realize oh i don't have any clone gel

887
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:09,278
you've got all these clones cut you got

888
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:09,839
your dome set up and no [ __ ] clone

889
00:25:09,278 --> 00:25:11,519
gel

890
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:13,359
make sure you've got all of the stuff

891
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:14,798
you're going to need set yourself up for

892
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:16,000
success then once you've got all your

893
00:25:14,798 --> 00:25:17,278
nutrients and things

894
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,038
that's when you're going to need

895
00:25:17,278 --> 00:25:21,200
pesticides and things like that

896
00:25:19,038 --> 00:25:22,480
then we will move into cleaning supplies

897
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,120
make sure you've got all the shelves

898
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,960
stocked

899
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:27,278
make sure you're well ready to go and

900
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,880
prepared also part of the

901
00:25:27,278 --> 00:25:31,519
monthly maintenance checklist i almost

902
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,080
forgot does the fire extinguisher have a

903
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:33,599
charge

904
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:35,599
your fire extinguisher's got a little

905
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:37,199
gauge the fire extinguisher may be a

906
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:38,399
rasta because it's got a red a yellow

907
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,080
and a green chart on it

908
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,840
and you want to be obviously in that

909
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:43,439
green that's when the fire extinguisher

910
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:45,278
is the best when it gets to the yellow

911
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,120
it is time to get that fire extinguisher

912
00:25:45,278 --> 00:25:48,720
either replaced or recharged

913
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:50,319
uh depending on the size quality and

914
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,000
brand of your fire extinguisher

915
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:53,439
many of them once they get to that point

916
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,720
uh they're done they've got to be

917
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,640
disposed of properly

918
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,079
some of them if they're the correct kind

919
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,840
you can take it to the fire department

920
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:00,240
and they will actually recharge that for

921
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:01,918
you

922
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,919
and make sure that you've got a safe

923
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,799
fire extinguisher also while we're on

924
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:06,400
this subject

925
00:26:04,798 --> 00:26:08,158
check all the batteries and your smoke

926
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,200
detectors and your carbon monoxide

927
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:10,640
detectors if you're

928
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,240
running co2 in your grow space that

929
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,799
carbon monoxide detector be

930
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:16,159
a totally different story but if you are

931
00:26:14,798 --> 00:26:17,440
if you've got smoke detectors

932
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:19,600
go test them out make sure that they

933
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,798
work we don't want to just have them as

934
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:23,278
props we want those

935
00:26:20,798 --> 00:26:24,400
to work all right i think that wraps up

936
00:26:23,278 --> 00:26:26,558
my grow room

937
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,080
maintenance episode i think the other

938
00:26:26,558 --> 00:26:29,918
thing i could say is just stand by the

939
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:32,079
door occasionally and just look

940
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:34,000
i notice a lot of details that i didn't

941
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:37,278
think about but i'm just looking i've

942
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,278
just got this look into the grill

943
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:41,038
just looking just glassing just staring

944
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:42,319
at the plants

945
00:26:41,038 --> 00:26:44,240
i don't know what i'm looking for but

946
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:44,960
i'll find something i always find one

947
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,640
thing

948
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,079
