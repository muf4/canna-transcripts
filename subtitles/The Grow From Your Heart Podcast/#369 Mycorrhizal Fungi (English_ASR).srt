alright podcast

37
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:17,709
in this episode I am going to do another

38
00:02:15,878 --> 00:02:19,479
grow lesson if you have been following

39
00:02:17,709 --> 00:02:22,239
along you know I've been doing a long

40
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:24,699
series of grow lessons in that series we

41
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,709
set a goal for our grow we found a safe

42
00:02:24,699 --> 00:02:28,869
place for our grow we've selected the

43
00:02:26,709 --> 00:02:30,700
appropriate equipment for our grow we've

44
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:32,650
also selected the appropriate nutrients

45
00:02:30,699 --> 00:02:34,869
and pest management system for that grow

46
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:37,030
now we have either sprouted seeds or

47
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:39,579
potted some clones now at this point of

48
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:42,188
our grow we have got clones or seedlings

49
00:02:39,579 --> 00:02:43,930
in small pots they are probably 6 to 10

50
00:02:42,188 --> 00:02:45,848
inches tall at this point and they're

51
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:47,889
developing nice fat roots that's where

52
00:02:45,848 --> 00:02:49,869
we are in these grow lessons in this

53
00:02:47,889 --> 00:02:51,939
lesson I plan to talk a little bit more

54
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:53,709
about small veg we're going to continue

55
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:55,150
that conversation since time has

56
00:02:53,709 --> 00:02:57,250
progressed since we put our plants into

57
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:59,200
the small pots then I want to work my

58
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:01,060
way into talking about micro products

59
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:02,858
and root development and the importance

60
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:06,519
of healthy roots and the benefits of

61
00:03:02,859 --> 00:03:08,290
using a quality microbe product some of

62
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:09,908
this episode may feel like a recap some

63
00:03:08,289 --> 00:03:12,068
of it will be a recap but we will work

64
00:03:09,908 --> 00:03:13,810
our way right into our current state so

65
00:03:12,068 --> 00:03:15,608
be patient sometimes I feel like it's

66
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:17,680
good to remind people not everybody

67
00:03:15,609 --> 00:03:19,599
listens to every episode so I like to

68
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,790
get people up to speed before I move

69
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:24,068
forward I do need to correct myself I

70
00:03:21,789 --> 00:03:25,870
made a mistake on the last episode in

71
00:03:24,068 --> 00:03:28,000
the last episode I was talking about

72
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:29,919
ideal lighting for our small plants and

73
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,709
I feel like I completely overlooked

74
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:34,719
ceramic metal halide lighting ceramic

75
00:03:32,709 --> 00:03:37,030
metal halide lighting is a very viable

76
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:38,919
and useful option for your small plants

77
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:41,169
if you feel like I left you out by not

78
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:43,569
mentioning the CMH lighting I apologize

79
00:03:41,169 --> 00:03:45,549
those are quality lights and I recommend

80
00:03:43,568 --> 00:03:47,530
new growers to use those lights for

81
00:03:45,549 --> 00:03:49,030
small plants if that is an option they

82
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:50,438
are affordable they don't put out a lot

83
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:52,598
of light and they don't use a lot of

84
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:54,668
electricity so a ceramic metal halide

85
00:03:52,598 --> 00:03:57,098
light is a very viable option for a

86
00:03:54,669 --> 00:03:59,439
small grow for a new grower for small

87
00:03:57,098 --> 00:04:02,048
plants also if you want to step up move

88
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:03,969
up from the 315 s to the 6 30s I've seen

89
00:04:02,049 --> 00:04:06,340
great results with those in a flowering

90
00:04:03,969 --> 00:04:07,810
room as well so don't let me forget the

91
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:09,819
ceramic metal halide lighting anymore

92
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:11,919
that is always a viable option in a

93
00:04:09,818 --> 00:04:14,289
cannabis grow now let's get back on

94
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:17,228
track and talk more about continuing our

95
00:04:14,289 --> 00:04:20,019
small veg phase again what I consider

96
00:04:17,228 --> 00:04:22,300
small veg our small plants anything

97
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:24,310
basically from a cloner or a seedling

98
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:26,169
that is in a small pot maybe like a 4

99
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:27,759
inch pot maybe a 6 inch net pot maybe

100
00:04:26,168 --> 00:04:29,529
all the way up to an 8 inch pot

101
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,209
but our smaller plants that don't have a

102
00:04:29,529 --> 00:04:33,159
super strong healthy developed root

103
00:04:31,209 --> 00:04:35,109
system are plants that are probably only

104
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:38,260
eight to ten inches tall those are what

105
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:39,580
I am considering my small veg plants now

106
00:04:38,259 --> 00:04:41,379
up to this point we've mainly been

107
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:44,500
focusing on healthy pests and pathogens

108
00:04:41,379 --> 00:04:46,240
free plants I suggest you check every

109
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:48,519
day for the presence of pests or

110
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,280
pathogens even as the plants are small

111
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:52,719
we still need to pay close attention

112
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:53,949
flip a leaf over see if you see any

113
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,960
weirdness on the bottom of the leaves

114
00:04:53,949 --> 00:04:57,610
pay attention to the tops of the leaves

115
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:59,589
do you see any stippling that's a sign

116
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:01,720
of spider mites do you see any gooey

117
00:04:59,589 --> 00:05:04,060
stuff that's a sign of thrips just pay

118
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:05,320
attention flick some of the plants flick

119
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:07,120
some of the containers do you see

120
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:09,339
anything fly out that is a sign of

121
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,540
either fungus gnats or white flies if

122
00:05:09,339 --> 00:05:11,919
they're white they're white flies if

123
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:14,260
they're black they're probably fungus

124
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:15,910
gnats just pay attention for pests in

125
00:05:14,259 --> 00:05:17,860
our small plants it's really easy to

126
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:20,170
take care of them if we do get them but

127
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:21,939
we need to identify our problems early

128
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:24,189
so that we can conquer them before they

129
00:05:21,939 --> 00:05:26,769
get out of control so go in and check

130
00:05:24,189 --> 00:05:28,750
for pests every day check for powdery

131
00:05:26,769 --> 00:05:30,819
mildew you should be able to spot it on

132
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:32,949
these little plants very easily it will

133
00:05:30,819 --> 00:05:34,990
start in the center of a leaf it will

134
00:05:32,949 --> 00:05:36,579
usually start at the widest point of one

135
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:38,199
of your biggest leaves and it will look

136
00:05:36,579 --> 00:05:40,449
like somebody just took a little drop of

137
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:42,399
donut powdered sugar and just dropped it

138
00:05:40,449 --> 00:05:44,680
right on your leaf it'll look like some

139
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:46,419
sort of white powdery water it dried up

140
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:48,790
and just left a little stain right there

141
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:51,160
that is the first indicator of powdery

142
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:53,290
mildew it will probably happen in a

143
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,960
lowlight area we are not getting a lot

144
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:57,310
of light but there is a lot of moisture

145
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:59,289
oftentimes it will happen or that little

146
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:01,060
bit of water just hangs on that one leaf

147
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:02,680
in that one spot and it never quite goes

148
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:05,199
away that's where you're going to get

149
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:07,150
the PM so pay attention for bugs pay

150
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,189
attention for powdery mildew our main

151
00:06:07,149 --> 00:06:11,259
goal right now is to keep these plants

152
00:06:09,189 --> 00:06:13,779
pests and pathogens free and keep them

153
00:06:11,259 --> 00:06:15,579
developing strong healthy root systems

154
00:06:13,779 --> 00:06:17,679
so that we have strong healthy plants

155
00:06:15,579 --> 00:06:20,050
when it's time to transplant them and

156
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,250
then later move them into flower now

157
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:22,509
that your plants are starting to grow

158
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:24,339
and you've spent some time with them

159
00:06:22,509 --> 00:06:26,050
you've probably seen what happens when

160
00:06:24,339 --> 00:06:27,789
you over and under water them a little

161
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:29,740
bit you've probably done one or the

162
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:32,290
other which has probably caused a little

163
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:34,449
bit of funky leaves I encourage you to

164
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:36,610
pull off all of the ugly leaves if

165
00:06:34,449 --> 00:06:39,009
you've got yellowing crispy leaves take

166
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:41,530
those off those yellow leaves are an

167
00:06:39,009 --> 00:06:43,480
invitation for spider mites

168
00:06:41,529 --> 00:06:45,099
that's why we use yellow sticky cards in

169
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:46,720
the garden to help the pests go to those

170
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:48,400
cards we see them on the cards and we

171
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,260
can tell that they're there but the past

172
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:52,239
love to go to that yellow they think

173
00:06:50,259 --> 00:06:54,099
that is a weak leaf imagine you're a

174
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,050
hungry spider mite and you see a big

175
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:58,210
healthy robust leaf that's got a really

176
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:59,530
thick layer of healthy vegetation to

177
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:01,539
chew through before you can get some

178
00:06:59,529 --> 00:07:03,189
nutrients out of it or imagine just a

179
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:04,990
little lower on the plant you've got a

180
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:06,879
weak leaf it's yellow on the outside

181
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:08,290
it's got a real thin layer and you can

182
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:09,790
just poke right through it suck all the

183
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:11,830
juice you want right out of it like a

184
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:13,720
hungry little vampire bug you are you're

185
00:07:11,829 --> 00:07:15,609
gonna go right to those weak yellow

186
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:17,080
leaves it's not as much work for food

187
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:18,730
you can get right in there and get what

188
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:21,069
you need the spider mites are going

189
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:22,720
right for that yellow weak part so pull

190
00:07:21,069 --> 00:07:24,069
off all those weak parts pull off all

191
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,450
the yellow leaves that's where the

192
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:26,829
problems are going to start anyway

193
00:07:25,449 --> 00:07:28,269
that's where the plant is the weakest

194
00:07:26,829 --> 00:07:30,490
get that out of there

195
00:07:28,269 --> 00:07:32,259
now while you're pulling off leaves you

196
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:33,759
may notice that the couple of branches

197
00:07:32,259 --> 00:07:35,409
at the very bottom of your plant are

198
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,969
just weak and shitty and kind of in the

199
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:38,860
way if you've got a couple of leaves

200
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:40,419
that are hanging down into the dirt pick

201
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:42,550
that stuff right off we don't need that

202
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:44,949
very bottom crap on the plant by the

203
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:46,600
time it makes it to flower we're going

204
00:07:44,949 --> 00:07:48,519
to clean up the bottom eight to ten

205
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:50,950
inches of that stalk anyway those bottom

206
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:52,029
branches will not even be there I feel

207
00:07:50,949 --> 00:07:54,189
like if you take some of those little

208
00:07:52,029 --> 00:07:55,989
sucker branches off the bottom now it

209
00:07:54,189 --> 00:07:57,550
will encourage growth up to the top of

210
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:58,990
the plant we don't need that stuff on

211
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:00,280
the bottom the light's not going to get

212
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:02,050
to it that's where the problems are

213
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:04,418
gonna happen why not cut that stuff

214
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:05,860
right off if you're happy with the way

215
00:08:04,418 --> 00:08:07,359
your plants look without pruning

216
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:09,819
anything off the bottom you don't have

217
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,500
to do it but if you've got two or three

218
00:08:09,819 --> 00:08:13,000
branches on the bottom that just aren't

219
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,918
growing to reach the rest of the

220
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,600
branches if they look weak why not take

221
00:08:14,918 --> 00:08:17,978
them off we don't need that weak [ __ ]

222
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:20,229
down there at the bottom of the plant

223
00:08:17,978 --> 00:08:22,149
wasting energy wasting nutrients and

224
00:08:20,228 --> 00:08:23,918
wasting water let's just cut it right

225
00:08:22,149 --> 00:08:24,668
off and send that energy right up to the

226
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:26,469
top of the plant

227
00:08:24,668 --> 00:08:27,819
now as the plants get bigger you'll

228
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:30,040
notice they're starting to branch out a

229
00:08:27,819 --> 00:08:32,019
little bit on the bottoms of some of the

230
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:34,658
branches you may start developing shoots

231
00:08:32,019 --> 00:08:36,819
if those little shoots are weak you can

232
00:08:34,658 --> 00:08:38,860
pinch those off as well you don't have

233
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:40,330
to take off the entire branch you can

234
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:42,158
just take off the shitty shoots at the

235
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:43,810
bottom and you can still leave the ends

236
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:46,360
of those branches and you can still have

237
00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:48,609
more bud sites and more branches don't

238
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,930
take off too much now you can always

239
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:52,450
take off more in the future

240
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:54,309
you cannot glue branches back onto the

241
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:55,009
plant and keep in mind the plant grows

242
00:08:54,309 --> 00:08:56,689
out of

243
00:08:55,009 --> 00:08:58,549
top so the [ __ ] you take off the bottom

244
00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:00,380
will not replace itself you're cleaning

245
00:08:58,549 --> 00:09:02,419
up the bottom that is gone it's going to

246
00:09:00,379 --> 00:09:04,189
grow out of the top keep that in mind

247
00:09:02,419 --> 00:09:05,929
now let's talk a little bit about

248
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:08,000
nutrients I always recommend starting

249
00:09:05,929 --> 00:09:09,679
off with light nutrients if your plants

250
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,059
are showing any yellow or if they're not

251
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:13,519
growing as quickly as you would like

252
00:09:11,059 --> 00:09:15,409
them to you may need to increase the

253
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,029
overall amount of nutrients we are

254
00:09:15,409 --> 00:09:19,219
giving the plants I always recommend

255
00:09:17,029 --> 00:09:21,289
starting low and increasing as time goes

256
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:23,240
on if your plants are a little bit pale

257
00:09:21,289 --> 00:09:24,500
or yellowish if they're not as green as

258
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:26,570
we would hope it would be at this point

259
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:29,210
it is probably time to increase our

260
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:31,580
nutrients also it may be time to add

261
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:33,110
some cal-mag to the mix if your plants

262
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:35,120
are growing properly if they're nice and

263
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:36,980
robust if they've got a nice root system

264
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,409
in this small pot I would recommend

265
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:42,320
adding a small dose of cal-mag once a

266
00:09:39,409 --> 00:09:43,939
week to your feeding regimen if you feel

267
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,410
like you're feeding your plants properly

268
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:46,940
you're giving them a proper amount of

269
00:09:45,409 --> 00:09:48,919
nitrogen you're giving them the proper

270
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:50,630
amount of Calem AG you're also giving

271
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:52,039
them some beneficials for the roots and

272
00:09:50,629 --> 00:09:54,049
you're not seeing the growth you would

273
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:57,379
like to see I would suspect that it's

274
00:09:54,049 --> 00:09:59,120
probably a pH issue check the pH of the

275
00:09:57,379 --> 00:10:01,460
solution you were feeding your plants if

276
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,200
your pH is off your plants won't be able

277
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:05,600
to uptake nutrients which means they

278
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:08,000
will not grow so once you have mixed up

279
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,940
your nutrients put your pH pin in there

280
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,309
and see what the pH of that solution is

281
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:15,620
before you feed it to your plants if

282
00:10:13,309 --> 00:10:18,889
it's not in the appropriate range adjust

283
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:20,450
it this is such an overlooked step most

284
00:10:18,889 --> 00:10:22,490
of the time when people send me pictures

285
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:23,270
of their plants they say what is wrong

286
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:26,000
with my plant

287
00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:27,949
I ask them what was the pH of your last

288
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,169
feeding solution you know what most of

289
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:32,180
their answers are I don't know so I

290
00:10:30,169 --> 00:10:33,769
usually tell them check the pH and get

291
00:10:32,179 --> 00:10:35,629
back to me because I would assume if

292
00:10:33,769 --> 00:10:37,129
you're not checking the pH that is

293
00:10:35,629 --> 00:10:39,350
probably the issue you didn't even

294
00:10:37,129 --> 00:10:41,360
bother to check how do I know if you've

295
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:42,860
got another nutritional problem how do I

296
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,110
know if you're overfeeding or under

297
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:47,090
feeding a specific nutrient if I don't

298
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:49,669
know what the pH of your solution is

299
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:51,800
you've got to dial in the pH I've done

300
00:10:49,669 --> 00:10:54,949
an entire episode on the importance of

301
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:56,929
pH for these small plants I really think

302
00:10:54,950 --> 00:11:00,020
they would be happiest with a pH right

303
00:10:56,929 --> 00:11:01,759
around 6 1 or 6 - you can go 5 8 2 6 3

304
00:11:00,019 --> 00:11:04,909
if you really want to have a wide range

305
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:06,919
but I think 6 1 or 6 2 in cocoa or

306
00:11:04,909 --> 00:11:08,719
soilless mix is going to be ideal for

307
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:10,909
these small plants

308
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,470
we may increase that pH as we go along

309
00:11:10,909 --> 00:11:14,209
the growth process as we pay attention

310
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:16,610
to the plants and see how they react to

311
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:19,160
certain things but for now I think this

312
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:21,050
6.2 is right about where we need to be

313
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:22,490
all right so we've got clean healthy

314
00:11:21,049 --> 00:11:24,019
plants we don't have any bugs we don't

315
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:25,789
have any powdery mildew we have

316
00:11:24,019 --> 00:11:28,069
increased our nutrients to increase our

317
00:11:25,789 --> 00:11:30,529
vigor and increase growth speed it is

318
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:32,210
probably time to spread your plants out

319
00:11:30,529 --> 00:11:34,069
if they are too pressed together if

320
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:35,720
they're too crowded they're not going to

321
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:37,430
branch out properly so if you've got

322
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:39,350
them crushed in there real tight it's

323
00:11:37,429 --> 00:11:41,239
time to spread them out if it looks like

324
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:43,399
your plants are getting too tall and too

325
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:45,470
skinny and too stretchy it's one of two

326
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:47,059
things they either want more light or

327
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:49,040
they are too close together which

328
00:11:47,059 --> 00:11:50,869
probably just means they want more light

329
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:53,029
if you've got branches pressed together

330
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:54,740
if you've got leaves pressed together if

331
00:11:53,029 --> 00:11:56,539
you've got plants overlapping each other

332
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:58,490
if you've got one plant pressed up

333
00:11:56,539 --> 00:12:00,409
against the wall they know they're too

334
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:02,419
tight together and instead of branching

335
00:12:00,409 --> 00:12:04,100
out they're gonna go straight up and try

336
00:12:02,419 --> 00:12:05,629
to get some light they are all competing

337
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:07,790
for light space and you're probably

338
00:12:05,629 --> 00:12:09,620
running your small veg under smaller

339
00:12:07,789 --> 00:12:11,509
lights which means they're really

340
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:13,399
competing for that space if we crowd

341
00:12:11,509 --> 00:12:15,529
them in spread them out let them get

342
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:17,870
some light light is the number one

343
00:12:15,529 --> 00:12:20,600
desired nutrient and source of energy

344
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:22,190
for our plants over their entire life

345
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:24,409
cycles they want light more than

346
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:26,300
anything light is the key

347
00:12:24,409 --> 00:12:28,189
these plants think they're going to get

348
00:12:26,299 --> 00:12:30,500
the Sun and we brought them indoors and

349
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:32,180
wired up little t5 bulbs and we're

350
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,889
trying to make them grow with that so

351
00:12:32,179 --> 00:12:36,349
spoil them and give them as much of that

352
00:12:33,889 --> 00:12:38,149
t5 lighting as they can get give them as

353
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:40,550
much space as they can handle so that

354
00:12:38,149 --> 00:12:42,829
you can get maximum performance from our

355
00:12:40,549 --> 00:12:44,750
small plants so now I feel like we've

356
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:46,970
got healthy plants that are pest free

357
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:48,379
that are probably about eight to ten

358
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:50,330
inches tall we're starting to get nice

359
00:12:48,379 --> 00:12:51,769
branching on the bottom we've cleaned up

360
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:53,660
those crappy branches on the bottom

361
00:12:51,769 --> 00:12:55,159
we've pulled off any funky leaves we've

362
00:12:53,659 --> 00:12:57,110
spread them out so that they're not too

363
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:59,179
crowded we are probably going to

364
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:01,190
transplant these plants into their

365
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:03,349
forever homes within the next week or

366
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:05,030
two that's going to be the next grow

367
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:07,460
lesson that I provide will be

368
00:13:05,029 --> 00:13:09,588
transplanting into our forever homes I

369
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:12,440
think one thing we should really focus

370
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:14,750
on until we transplant is fat root

371
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:16,760
development I like my plants to be

372
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:19,070
nearly root bound in these small pots

373
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:20,689
before I transplant them I like to have

374
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:22,490
to kind of break that root ball up at

375
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:24,950
transplant to make it explode

376
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:27,139
it sounds crazy but if you get that root

377
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:28,940
ball kind of tight in a small pot when

378
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:30,919
we transplant it into the next pot it

379
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:33,350
will really take off we will really see

380
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:35,509
explosive growth we will have a really

381
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:37,790
robust and healthy plant from the very

382
00:13:35,509 --> 00:13:39,708
beginning with a solid foundation so

383
00:13:37,789 --> 00:13:41,958
let's let these plants grow and get kind

384
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:43,250
of tight in their pots you may see some

385
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:45,139
roots coming out of the bottom of your

386
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:46,789
container that is a good thing if those

387
00:13:45,139 --> 00:13:48,649
roots are nice and white that means you

388
00:13:46,789 --> 00:13:50,240
were feeding those roots very well that

389
00:13:48,649 --> 00:13:51,919
your plants are very happy that they are

390
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,330
getting a nice amount of moisture that

391
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:55,099
they're getting a nice amount of dry

392
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:57,920
time that everything is going well

393
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:59,540
inside here rhizosphere now if you want

394
00:13:57,919 --> 00:14:00,740
to take a look at your roots and see

395
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:03,588
what kind of root development you're

396
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:07,039
working with don't be afraid to grab a

397
00:14:03,589 --> 00:14:08,990
cup or a pot with a plant in it and put

398
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:10,490
your finger over the pot and kind of

399
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:11,659
make a spa Kent where you're spreading

400
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:13,940
your ring finger and your middle finger

401
00:14:11,659 --> 00:14:15,708
apart put the stock of the plant right

402
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:17,450
between those two fingers and then just

403
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:19,009
flick that pot upside down and give it a

404
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:21,379
little bit of a shake if you're

405
00:14:19,009 --> 00:14:23,299
confident you can pull that pot off and

406
00:14:21,379 --> 00:14:25,338
you can look directly at the root

407
00:14:23,299 --> 00:14:26,958
development if you start lifting that

408
00:14:25,339 --> 00:14:28,520
pot off and the dirt starts falling out

409
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:30,439
like crazy and it's not compact and

410
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:32,028
pressed together push it back in there

411
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:33,140
and just leave it alone the roots are

412
00:14:32,028 --> 00:14:35,509
not developed enough to try this

413
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:37,639
experiment if you start lifting that pot

414
00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:39,799
off and all the dirt stays in one piece

415
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:41,328
and you can see those roots you can just

416
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:43,009
lift that pot right off and you can take

417
00:14:41,328 --> 00:14:44,359
a look at the root development if you

418
00:14:43,009 --> 00:14:46,009
can see those roots wrapped around

419
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:47,659
inside of there and all the dirt and all

420
00:14:46,009 --> 00:14:49,610
the roots are tight into one piece that

421
00:14:47,659 --> 00:14:51,860
is what we're aiming for you are almost

422
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:53,690
ready for transplant I like to let those

423
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:55,339
get almost rootbound

424
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:57,200
where the plant is almost filling that

425
00:14:55,339 --> 00:14:59,420
container with roots to where it is

426
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:02,028
almost panicking time to put that into a

427
00:14:59,419 --> 00:15:03,860
new pot I feel like if we wait that long

428
00:15:02,028 --> 00:15:06,230
to put it into our next pot we get

429
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:08,240
explosive root growth when we transplant

430
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:10,370
it into the next container I also feel

431
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,600
like we get less transplant shock and I

432
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:14,000
feel like the plant is more developed

433
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:16,730
and more prepared to go into its larger

434
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,159
container so if you are experienced or a

435
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:20,690
confident grab a plant flip it upside

436
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:22,819
down and knock the container off of it

437
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:24,140
and see what comes out if all the dirt

438
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:26,120
goes flying and the roots come

439
00:15:24,139 --> 00:15:27,708
unraveling and hanging out just plant

440
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:29,839
that back in there really carefully and

441
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:31,458
it will be okay if you're careful about

442
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,110
it do your best not to break any of the

443
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:34,698
roots don't disturb the roots you can

444
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:36,409
get them back in there while you've got

445
00:15:34,698 --> 00:15:38,059
it out sprinkle a little bit of root

446
00:15:36,409 --> 00:15:40,129
document powder on there sprinkle some

447
00:15:38,059 --> 00:15:41,628
plus life or some great white right onto

448
00:15:40,129 --> 00:15:43,670
the roots and put it back in there and

449
00:15:41,629 --> 00:15:45,829
that inoculant will encourage those

450
00:15:43,669 --> 00:15:48,019
roots to grow even more quickly than

451
00:15:45,828 --> 00:15:49,698
they already were all right podcast

452
00:15:48,019 --> 00:15:51,169
world I'm going to press pause for a

453
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:52,938
moment I need to take a drink I'll

454
00:15:51,169 --> 00:15:55,009
probably take a couple of dabs while I'm

455
00:15:52,938 --> 00:15:56,750
at it when I get back we will talk more

456
00:15:55,009 --> 00:15:58,430
about developing healthy roots and we

457
00:15:56,750 --> 00:16:00,438
will also talk about Michael Raizel

458
00:15:58,429 --> 00:16:02,778
fungus so take a dab with me and I will

459
00:16:00,438 --> 00:16:04,789
be right back alright podcasts rolled I

460
00:16:02,778 --> 00:16:07,250
am back I am well medicated I am well

461
00:16:04,789 --> 00:16:10,458
hydrated let's talk more about healthy

462
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:12,110
roots and mycorrhizal fungus before we

463
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:14,299
transfer our small plants into their

464
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:16,909
forever homes we want to develop thick

465
00:16:14,299 --> 00:16:18,409
healthy white roots we want a big fat

466
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:20,240
root system so that we've got a

467
00:16:18,409 --> 00:16:23,179
well-established plant to go into a

468
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:25,698
larger pot a good microbe product will

469
00:16:23,179 --> 00:16:27,289
encourage explosive root growth let's

470
00:16:25,698 --> 00:16:30,229
talk about some of the other advantages

471
00:16:27,289 --> 00:16:32,599
of our Michael Raizel fungus the first

472
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:34,159
obvious advantage is more roots more

473
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,629
roots means our plants can eat more

474
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:37,698
which means our plants can drink more

475
00:16:35,629 --> 00:16:39,709
which means our plants will grow more

476
00:16:37,698 --> 00:16:41,208
quickly which means we will produce more

477
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:43,278
branching which means we will produce

478
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:45,828
more buds which is our main goal

479
00:16:43,278 --> 00:16:48,409
so the first benefit more roots which

480
00:16:45,828 --> 00:16:50,629
means more productivity overall from our

481
00:16:48,409 --> 00:16:52,578
plants another great function of our

482
00:16:50,629 --> 00:16:55,009
beneficial fungus is they work as a

483
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:57,349
protective layer or a security guard for

484
00:16:55,009 --> 00:16:59,539
our root zone they protect against

485
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:01,699
pathogen problems and illness in our

486
00:16:59,539 --> 00:17:03,259
plants there is already a colony of

487
00:17:01,698 --> 00:17:05,209
beneficial fungus gathered around the

488
00:17:03,259 --> 00:17:07,370
roots if anything else tries to get near

489
00:17:05,209 --> 00:17:09,169
it those colonies say hey this is our

490
00:17:07,369 --> 00:17:11,359
turf bro and they fight off any

491
00:17:09,169 --> 00:17:13,788
potential pathogens that want to get to

492
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:16,038
your root zone some of our beneficial

493
00:17:13,788 --> 00:17:18,199
bacteria work in a similar function as

494
00:17:16,038 --> 00:17:20,240
an enzyme it will break down decaying

495
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:22,068
matter it will break down nutrients and

496
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,078
it will make it more bioavailable to our

497
00:17:22,068 --> 00:17:25,788
plants so our plants can take that waste

498
00:17:24,078 --> 00:17:28,490
and actually turn it into food and

499
00:17:25,788 --> 00:17:30,288
consume it and use it to its benefit now

500
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:32,329
if you are using a microbe product I

501
00:17:30,288 --> 00:17:33,950
don't recommend that you stop using your

502
00:17:32,329 --> 00:17:36,199
enzymes I recommend you use them

503
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:38,150
together let them team up and create a

504
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:40,340
beautiful environment in your raizo

505
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:42,019
sphere that will also create a lot of

506
00:17:40,339 --> 00:17:43,339
diversity you will have multiple things

507
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:45,259
in there breaking down the decaying

508
00:17:43,339 --> 00:17:47,990
matter that should really encourage a

509
00:17:45,259 --> 00:17:49,548
clean healthy raizou sphere another

510
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:50,299
function of some of our beneficial

511
00:17:49,548 --> 00:17:52,700
bacteria

512
00:17:50,299 --> 00:17:55,639
is the aid and the processes that

513
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:56,960
encourage branching and bud set so by

514
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:59,450
introducing these beneficial bacteria

515
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:02,240
you may see more branching and you may

516
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:03,259
see more bud sites in your plants now

517
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,269
another great thing that these

518
00:18:03,259 --> 00:18:08,599
beneficial bacteria is do is they were

519
00:18:05,269 --> 00:18:10,730
to increase essential oil production now

520
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:13,879
what are essential oils essential oils

521
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:15,740
are our terpenes and cannabinoids you

522
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:17,540
can increase the overall production of

523
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:20,450
your plants you can increase the overall

524
00:18:17,539 --> 00:18:23,389
flavor aroma and potency of your plants

525
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:26,059
by using be correct mycorrhizal fungus

526
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:28,910
now I try to avoid recommending brand

527
00:18:26,059 --> 00:18:30,889
names there are several great Michael

528
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:32,990
Raizel products available at your local

529
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:35,360
grocer or there are tons available

530
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:37,700
online I will list a few products that I

531
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:39,949
have had great experience with of course

532
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:42,140
I have to recommend recharge I really

533
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:43,789
like recharge recharge made my plants go

534
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:46,610
crazy one of the good things about

535
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:48,379
recharge is it contains dried molasses

536
00:18:46,609 --> 00:18:50,449
which is constantly feeding the microbes

537
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:53,110
the microbes do need some sort of feel

538
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:55,700
it's already got feel in that container

539
00:18:53,109 --> 00:18:57,979
another acceptable myko product is

540
00:18:55,700 --> 00:19:00,529
called extreme mykos and they spell

541
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:02,569
mykos with a k' it's a great product it

542
00:19:00,529 --> 00:19:05,509
is very affordable you don't have to buy

543
00:19:02,569 --> 00:19:07,039
a very expensive micro product if you

544
00:19:05,509 --> 00:19:08,869
want something that's affordable if

545
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:10,759
you're just gonna try it out extreme

546
00:19:08,869 --> 00:19:12,889
mykos is probably one of the most

547
00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:15,379
affordable microbe products on the

548
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:17,750
market if you want a liquid microbe

549
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:20,630
product you can get Hydra guard from

550
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:22,519
botanic care I really like great white

551
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:24,050
great white is a powdered microbe

552
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:25,759
product I like the powders because you

553
00:19:24,049 --> 00:19:26,899
can sprinkle them directly onto the

554
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:29,059
roots we're gonna talk more about that

555
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:31,130
when we get to the transplanting episode

556
00:19:29,059 --> 00:19:33,319
but during transplant I like to sprinkle

557
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:35,060
the powders directly onto the roots and

558
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:37,039
into the hole where I am transplanting

559
00:19:35,059 --> 00:19:38,419
my plant I also trance prinkle some

560
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:41,389
right around the outside where it's

561
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:43,670
gonna grow these beneficial fungus do

562
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:45,410
not work unless they actually touch the

563
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:46,789
roots of the plant so they have to touch

564
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:49,310
the plant that triggers them to

565
00:19:46,789 --> 00:19:51,230
germinate and become alive so they have

566
00:19:49,309 --> 00:19:52,879
to come in contact so sprinkle those

567
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:54,319
powders right onto the roots I really

568
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,000
like that if you want to stick with

569
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:57,529
liquid and use something similar to the

570
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,019
great white they make a product called

571
00:19:57,529 --> 00:20:01,910
orca orcas very similar to the great

572
00:20:00,019 --> 00:20:03,660
white they took out two specific

573
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:04,970
beneficial funguses but I

574
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:06,960
think you'll ever notice they're missing

575
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:09,299
it's just easier to keep them in a

576
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,730
liquid solution without that fungus in

577
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:13,829
their great white also makes a product

578
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:15,420
called my coach um I spoke earlier that

579
00:20:13,829 --> 00:20:17,220
I like recharge because it's got a

580
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:19,410
product that feeds their beneficials

581
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:21,569
that comes in one package the folks that

582
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:24,420
make great white and Orca have put out a

583
00:20:21,569 --> 00:20:26,250
product called my coach um that product

584
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:27,870
will feed your beneficials it also

585
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:30,000
contains unearth other things that will

586
00:20:27,869 --> 00:20:32,789
encourage root growth and healthy plants

587
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,099
the folks that make great white and Orca

588
00:20:32,789 --> 00:20:37,289
and my coach um also make a time-release

589
00:20:35,099 --> 00:20:39,480
granule if I'm working in a large

590
00:20:37,289 --> 00:20:41,009
container I like to start that pot with

591
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:43,440
some of the time-release granules

592
00:20:41,009 --> 00:20:45,269
already in the soil I'll mix up a large

593
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,160
batch of soil with my amendments with my

594
00:20:45,269 --> 00:20:49,339
perlite with my purse alight and then I

595
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:51,810
will just pour a big bag of the dried

596
00:20:49,339 --> 00:20:53,730
granules from great white right across

597
00:20:51,809 --> 00:20:55,259
the top of that makes it right in put

598
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:57,539
that into the pot and plant right into

599
00:20:55,259 --> 00:20:59,039
that the plants go crazy I feel like

600
00:20:57,539 --> 00:21:01,619
giving them plenty of that beneficial

601
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:04,379
bacteria really reduces transplant shock

602
00:21:01,619 --> 00:21:04,979
and it really encourages explosive root

603
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:07,590
growth

604
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:09,930
another powdered root inoculant i can

605
00:21:07,589 --> 00:21:12,269
recommend is the plus life from our

606
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:14,430
friends at veg bloom many of the

607
00:21:12,269 --> 00:21:16,710
commercial grows in colorado are running

608
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:18,960
veg bloom so i would encourage them just

609
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:22,079
to add the plus life product right along

610
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:24,450
the veg bloom base mix I have had great

611
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:27,210
success using be veg bloom product line

612
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:29,610
and adding the plus life root inoculant

613
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:31,620
powder along with that mix and I've used

614
00:21:29,609 --> 00:21:33,809
that and grows of all different sizes

615
00:21:31,619 --> 00:21:36,419
I've used it in for light grows and I've

616
00:21:33,809 --> 00:21:38,599
used it in 400 light grows and I like

617
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:40,529
the way it works in all conditions

618
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:43,379
alright I've got one more product to

619
00:21:40,529 --> 00:21:45,990
talk about another great liquid microbe

620
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:48,360
product is mammoth pea mammoth pea is a

621
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:50,160
great product one of the great things

622
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:52,169
about mammoth pea is it is highly

623
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:54,540
concentrated another great thing is you

624
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:57,120
do not have to add anything to feed the

625
00:21:54,539 --> 00:21:59,009
microbes mammoth pea uses microbes they

626
00:21:57,119 --> 00:22:00,899
can sustain themselves off of the carbon

627
00:21:59,009 --> 00:22:03,390
in the breakdown happening within the

628
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:05,519
raizo sphere so that is a list of great

629
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:08,580
microbe products I would recommend they

630
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:11,400
vary in application rates they vary in

631
00:22:08,579 --> 00:22:14,069
amount of microbes per container and

632
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:17,220
they are going to vary widely in prices

633
00:22:14,069 --> 00:22:19,259
find what works best for you and your Go

634
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:21,390
in some of you are going to enjoy the

635
00:22:19,259 --> 00:22:23,099
dried powdered forms more some of you

636
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:25,320
are going to like the liquid forms more

637
00:22:23,099 --> 00:22:27,538
some of you simply cannot get the

638
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:29,428
overpriced expensive products some of

639
00:22:27,538 --> 00:22:31,470
you will only buy the overpriced

640
00:22:29,429 --> 00:22:33,538
expensive products I get it everybody's

641
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:36,150
got their style that's why I recommended

642
00:22:33,538 --> 00:22:37,740
several products I have used each of

643
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:39,330
those products I've had great experience

644
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:41,308
with those products and I feel like I

645
00:22:39,329 --> 00:22:43,048
can recommend those products to you with

646
00:22:41,308 --> 00:22:45,750
confidence that they're going to work in

647
00:22:43,048 --> 00:22:47,579
your garden under just about any type of

648
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:49,769
conditions or any type of environment

649
00:22:47,579 --> 00:22:51,779
now keep in mind that you may need to

650
00:22:49,769 --> 00:22:53,460
feed your microbes I mentioned earlier

651
00:22:51,779 --> 00:22:55,619
that some of the microbes do contain

652
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:57,690
other additives it will feed themselves

653
00:22:55,619 --> 00:23:00,689
I will still encourage you to feed the

654
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:03,179
microbes the microbes want to eat carbs

655
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:04,980
the plants want to eat carbs add a

656
00:23:03,179 --> 00:23:06,419
little bit of carbohydrates the

657
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:08,370
carbohydrates will give your plants

658
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:10,190
energy and the carbohydrates will feed

659
00:23:08,369 --> 00:23:12,869
your microbes it's a win-win situation

660
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:15,450
don't overdose the carbs trying to feed

661
00:23:12,869 --> 00:23:17,428
them both I generally suggest starting

662
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:18,840
off with half of the recommended dose if

663
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:21,570
you buy a bottle of a carbohydrate

664
00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:24,119
product and it says feed 40 I recommend

665
00:23:21,569 --> 00:23:25,950
you start off with 20 pay attention if

666
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:28,288
the plant seemed happy you don't need to

667
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:30,090
increase the dosage if you want to you

668
00:23:28,288 --> 00:23:31,650
can increase the dosage until you see

669
00:23:30,089 --> 00:23:33,329
the plants react poorly that's what a

670
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:35,130
lot of growers like to do push it as

671
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:36,960
hard as we can and then back off that's

672
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:38,280
how you learn the limits of a plant but

673
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,288
if you're a newer grower if you're not

674
00:23:38,279 --> 00:23:42,269
super experienced just feed it half of

675
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:44,369
that recommended dosage and the plants

676
00:23:42,269 --> 00:23:46,440
will be receiving that nutrition even if

677
00:23:44,369 --> 00:23:47,879
you don't see anything happening be

678
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:49,650
careful overdoing it with the

679
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:52,350
carbohydrate product late and flour

680
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:54,179
because it will make your buds burn like

681
00:23:52,349 --> 00:23:55,769
a rock they'll just turn into a charcoal

682
00:23:54,179 --> 00:23:58,500
briquette and they won't burn very well

683
00:23:55,769 --> 00:24:00,929
if you overdo it with the molasses or a

684
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:03,390
carbohydrate product late in bloom now

685
00:24:00,929 --> 00:24:05,250
earlier I mentioned my coach um if you

686
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:07,409
want a quality product to feed your

687
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:09,210
microbes and encourage micro growth and

688
00:24:07,409 --> 00:24:11,490
encourage root growth and overall plant

689
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:13,169
health check out my coach um from the

690
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:15,089
same folks that make the great white

691
00:24:13,169 --> 00:24:16,259
product line now when it comes to

692
00:24:15,089 --> 00:24:19,740
feeding your microbes

693
00:24:16,259 --> 00:24:22,288
I recommend more frequent smaller doses

694
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:24,210
now the first time I introduced microbes

695
00:24:22,288 --> 00:24:26,250
to my feeding regimen I usually give it

696
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:29,700
what the bottle says if the container

697
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:30,720
says one gram or 25 milliliters I will

698
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:32,429
add that to my new

699
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:35,429
treant solution and i will water that

700
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:37,409
right in my goal is to get a good start

701
00:24:35,429 --> 00:24:38,970
of a colonization of microbes I just

702
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:40,230
want to give it a good head start just

703
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:42,779
put them in there and get them going

704
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:45,150
then my subsequent waterings I will

705
00:24:42,779 --> 00:24:48,240
probably give it half of the recommended

706
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:51,150
dosage but those products usually say to

707
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:53,579
water it in once a week instead of doing

708
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:56,640
it once a week I'll reduce the dosage to

709
00:24:53,579 --> 00:24:59,699
half and water it every time I water for

710
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:02,100
a couple of weeks to build a nice solid

711
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:04,500
colony of beneficial fungus in my raizo

712
00:25:02,099 --> 00:25:06,089
sphere now after I transplant into my

713
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:07,679
three gallon pots and I get the root

714
00:25:06,089 --> 00:25:09,449
zone crankin and I've got a nice fat

715
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:12,900
root ball in that pot I will start

716
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:15,029
reducing my frequency of inoculant

717
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:17,309
feedings in a commercial grow when I'm

718
00:25:15,029 --> 00:25:19,678
in flower I generally feed plus life

719
00:25:17,308 --> 00:25:21,298
once a week and that's enough through

720
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,769
the flowering cycle once I've got the

721
00:25:21,298 --> 00:25:24,900
roots nice and healthy and everything

722
00:25:22,769 --> 00:25:27,210
has developed I will generally use the

723
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:29,038
plus life to keep problems away it keeps

724
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:31,440
the root zone nice and clean a nice

725
00:25:29,038 --> 00:25:33,150
enzymatic product and a nice Michael

726
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,798
Raizel product again will work to keep

727
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:37,080
the roots clean and healthy and happy

728
00:25:34,798 --> 00:25:39,450
and pathogen free so I'll just continue

729
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:41,849
the once a week feeding just to keep

730
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:43,950
everybody clean and happy and kind of

731
00:25:41,849 --> 00:25:46,048
it's sort of like plant probiotics it's

732
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:47,788
like giving probiotics to a plant if you

733
00:25:46,048 --> 00:25:49,619
take probiotics for your gut health it

734
00:25:47,788 --> 00:25:51,929
just has it good you've got a good gut

735
00:25:49,619 --> 00:25:54,229
biome we were making a good gut biome

736
00:25:51,929 --> 00:25:56,788
for our plants by feeding them

737
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:58,710
probiotics which are actually Michael

738
00:25:56,788 --> 00:25:59,129
Raizel fungus when it comes to the plant

739
00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:00,960
world

740
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:02,340
all right podcast world I've got one

741
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,600
more thing to talk about and then we

742
00:26:02,339 --> 00:26:05,819
were going to start wrapping up this

743
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:08,519
episode when you were listening or

744
00:26:05,819 --> 00:26:10,889
reading or learning about Michael Raizel

745
00:26:08,519 --> 00:26:13,349
fungus you will hear three words quite

746
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:16,320
frequently that basically mean the same

747
00:26:13,349 --> 00:26:18,629
thing you will hear the word inoculated

748
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:21,178
you will hear the word vaccinated and he

749
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:23,490
will also hear the word infected these

750
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:26,429
words all basically mean that the root

751
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:29,849
zone shows the presence of a mycorrhizal

752
00:26:26,429 --> 00:26:31,980
fungus we inoculate our root zone with a

753
00:26:29,849 --> 00:26:34,379
fungus by adding it ourselves we have

754
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:35,480
now inoculated it once that takes hold

755
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:38,130
it is basically

756
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:40,259
vaccinated once it travels across the

757
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:41,970
root zone it is infected that is a

758
00:26:40,259 --> 00:26:44,700
positive thing I know they sound like

759
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:46,799
scary words but in this situation all

760
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:49,200
three of those words are positive things

761
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:50,789
that we want happening within our raizo

762
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,850
sphere so when you hear the word

763
00:26:50,789 --> 00:26:56,009
inoculated vaccinated or infected keep

764
00:26:53,849 --> 00:26:58,349
in mind it just means basically the

765
00:26:56,009 --> 00:27:00,720
presence of Michael Raizel fungus within

766
00:26:58,349 --> 00:27:02,579
our root zone all right podcast world

767
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:05,100
that is my talk about continuing small

768
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:07,169
healthy feds that is also my lesson on

769
00:27:05,099 --> 00:27:08,399
Michael Raizel fungus I want to thank

770
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:10,769
you guys for listening to this episode

771
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:13,140
if you were interested in learning a lot

772
00:27:10,769 --> 00:27:15,089
more about Michael Raizel fungi I highly

773
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:17,370
recommend a podcast called cannabis

774
00:27:15,089 --> 00:27:19,740
cultivation and sciences by tad Hussey

775
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:22,949
tad recently had Jim Egan on the show

776
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:25,140
and they do a deep dive into Michael

777
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:27,029
Raizel fungus and I highly recommend the

778
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:28,590
episode it was great timing I had

779
00:27:27,029 --> 00:27:30,599
already planned this episode to come out

780
00:27:28,589 --> 00:27:33,059
this week I was writing this episode and

781
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:34,500
then Monday this episode popped up it

782
00:27:33,059 --> 00:27:36,990
was beautifully time so you've got a

783
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:39,059
nice introduction from me and then tad

784
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:40,740
takes it really deep if you're going to

785
00:27:39,059 --> 00:27:43,169
listen to Tad's podcast I highly

786
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:45,900
recommend a notebook and a pen you are

787
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:47,670
going to learn a lot about cultivation

788
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:48,720
you will learn a lot about organic

789
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:50,640
cultivation you learn about

790
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,950
sustainability you will learn about

791
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:56,190
permaculture and he will certainly learn

792
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:58,110
about Michael Raizel fungi again the

793
00:27:56,190 --> 00:28:00,150
podcast is called cannabis cultivation

794
00:27:58,109 --> 00:28:02,429
and sciences and I highly recommend it

795
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:04,860
if you want to expand your cultivation

796
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:06,390
knowledge podcast world that's all I've

797
00:28:04,859 --> 00:28:08,429
got for you for this episode I want to
