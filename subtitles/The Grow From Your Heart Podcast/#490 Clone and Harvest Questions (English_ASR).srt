fuel and lemon cake I really get the

10
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:44,159
lemon cake I for sure get the fuel there

11
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:46,620
is a sweetness kind of a frosting flavor

12
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:48,779
that I will say could be animal crackers

13
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:51,808
the one thing I certainly did get from

14
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:53,160
this concentrate is stoned as [ __ ] I

15
00:00:51,808 --> 00:00:55,409
feel like my eyes are nice and heavy

16
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:57,328
feel like I'm kind of lazy my body feels

17
00:00:55,409 --> 00:00:59,939
nice and chill nice and relaxed I am

18
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:01,230
ready for a great podcast on the back of

19
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:03,509
the package it does say this product

20
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:06,390

we have got all of the business out of

52
00:02:18,598 --> 00:02:21,988
the way let's jump right into this

53
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,378
message that came from our buddy Dan

54
00:02:21,989 --> 00:02:27,989
dank UK Dan sent the message through

55
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:31,409
patreon and the message goes just like

56
00:02:27,989 --> 00:02:33,300
this hi raasta Jeff greetings from the

57
00:02:31,409 --> 00:02:33,629
UK hey thanks for listening way over

58
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,000
there

59
00:02:33,629 --> 00:02:38,280
it also says your podcast has given me a

60
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,250
great education to make my next grow

61
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,870
even better so many thanks for that you

62
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:44,939
were very welcome that is exactly my

63
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:46,980
goal is to help you improve your garden

64
00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:48,259
and understand your plants better so we

65
00:02:46,979 --> 00:02:49,889
are both reaching our goals

66
00:02:48,259 --> 00:02:52,229
congratulations and thanks for the

67
00:02:49,889 --> 00:02:54,359
compliment and goes on to say my

68
00:02:52,229 --> 00:02:56,548
question is I'm going to harvest my

69
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:59,310
plants in about 10 days and this was my

70
00:02:56,549 --> 00:03:01,920
first grow some buds look great like

71
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:04,289
lollipops but some others are more the

72
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:06,268
popcorn type what is the best way to

73
00:03:04,289 --> 00:03:08,340
harvest these do they need to stay

74
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:11,340
attached to a branch and hung up to dry

75
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:14,069
or can some of these smaller buds dry

76
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:16,348
sitting in a bowl you can read my name

77
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:19,738
but it's fake as we are in prohibition

78
00:03:16,348 --> 00:03:24,149
here in England many thanks take care

79
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:25,889
dude from dude dank UK hey my new friend

80
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:27,659
dude dank with a fake name over there in

81
00:03:25,889 --> 00:03:29,639
the UK thank you for listening to the

82
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:30,650
show thank you for the patreon support

83
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:33,450
and thank you for the great question

84
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:35,849
let's talk a little bit about hanging or

85
00:03:33,449 --> 00:03:37,919
drying these little popcorn buds it

86
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:39,539
sounds like you've got the right idea

87
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:41,818
you said that some of your buds are a

88
00:03:39,539 --> 00:03:43,769
lollipop type that makes me think that

89
00:03:41,818 --> 00:03:45,238
you at least attempted to clean up the

90
00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:47,069
lower parts of your plants and you were

91
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:49,409
mostly successful and you were able to

92
00:03:47,068 --> 00:03:50,759
get most of the energy up to the tops so

93
00:03:49,409 --> 00:03:53,549
it sounds like you've got a good grasp

94
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:54,449
on growing however you did not Wally pop

95
00:03:53,549 --> 00:03:56,519
sufficiently

96
00:03:54,449 --> 00:03:58,409
and you've got some little popcorn we

97
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:00,780
call it larf in my area it's little

98
00:03:58,409 --> 00:04:02,400
larkey buds just little popcorn Nuggets

99
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,629
just little lowers they probably could

100
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,700
have been pinched off that energy

101
00:04:03,629 --> 00:04:07,919
possibly could have gone up higher into

102
00:04:05,699 --> 00:04:09,358
the plant but here we are at harvest and

103
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:11,818
we've got some of these little popcorn

104
00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:14,040
buds what do we do with them those buds

105
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:16,108
do not have to stay on a stick or

106
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:17,848
anything they can get cut off they can

107
00:04:16,108 --> 00:04:20,189
get put into a bowl they can get put

108
00:04:17,848 --> 00:04:22,560
onto a tray often times growers use

109
00:04:20,189 --> 00:04:24,000
those tiered racks they hang from the

110
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,709
ceiling or they hang from something and

111
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,480
it's a it's a cylinder type thing with

112
00:04:25,709 --> 00:04:30,239
multiple shelves in there and it's

113
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:32,100
mash the main thing to think about is

114
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,560
not letting these buds get pressed

115
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:36,240
together or get too tightly squished so

116
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,030
that you start getting any sort of a

117
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,710
mold or a funky aroma or any problems

118
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:42,719
like that from the buds being pressed

119
00:04:40,709 --> 00:04:45,299
together we want plenty of airflow while

120
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,040
they dry now depending on the density of

121
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,449
these little buds you may want to spread

122
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,740
them out a little bit you may not want

123
00:04:48,449 --> 00:04:51,240
to put them in a bowl you may want to

124
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:53,280
put them flatter on something like a

125
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,560
tray but if they're fluffy if they're

126
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:57,539
really Airy a bowl shouldn't cause you

127
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,790
any problems just pay attention to them

128
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:01,110
maybe give them a stir every few hours

129
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:02,970
just to make sure that none of that

130
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:04,889
stuff is getting moldy getting funky

131
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:07,050
getting too compressed on the bottom

132
00:05:04,889 --> 00:05:09,240
again that all depends on how much of

133
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:11,490
this little popcorn buddy you've got and

134
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:13,710
the density it does not need to stay on

135
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:14,790
the stick it is really convenient just

136
00:05:13,709 --> 00:05:16,859
to chop it all off

137
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:18,360
spread it out maybe trim it up a little

138
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,920
bit what are you going to do with it are

139
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,569
you going to use it for smoke are you

140
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,949
going to use it to make concentrates are

141
00:05:21,569 --> 00:05:24,959
you going to make edibles out of it

142
00:05:22,949 --> 00:05:26,370
decide what you want to do with it if

143
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:27,539
you're not even going to smoke it you

144
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:30,420
don't have to bother trimming that

145
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:32,850
little stuff here in Colorado cannabis

146
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:35,340
is abundant anything that is not the

147
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:37,890
size I've got big thumbs anything that's

148
00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:40,139
not the size of most people's thumb it's

149
00:05:37,889 --> 00:05:42,569
tossed into what we call the hash pile

150
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:44,370
and we make concentrates out of that so

151
00:05:42,569 --> 00:05:46,139
if you're not going to smoke it as flour

152
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:47,670
don't bother trimming it there's no need

153
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:49,229
to take the time to take the leaves off

154
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:51,330
of it if you're going to turn it into

155
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:53,520
edibles or a concentrate or make

156
00:05:51,329 --> 00:05:55,319
topicals out of it or if it is going to

157
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:57,329
be consumed any other way than by

158
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:58,829
smoking it don't bother trimming it

159
00:05:57,329 --> 00:06:01,589
because it is just going to be a waste

160
00:05:58,829 --> 00:06:03,149
of time so the short answer is yes it

161
00:06:01,589 --> 00:06:05,699
should be safe to put those little

162
00:06:03,149 --> 00:06:07,349
popcorn buds on a tray or in a bowl I

163
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:09,300
would recommend something flatter and

164
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:10,800
wider so they're not stacked up once

165
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:12,689
they're a little drier you can start

166
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,879
bowling it stacking it up a little bit

167
00:06:12,689 --> 00:06:16,980
consolidating saving some space while

168
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:18,779
it's fresh and wet I may not stack it up

169
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:20,879
I may leave it nice and wide and spread

170
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:23,219
out it won't take too long for it to dry

171
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:24,509
especially if it's just popcorn buds it

172
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:26,250
should dry up quickly enough to where

173
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:27,839
you just gather it up into a bowl then

174
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:29,970
you can handle it that way just like you

175
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:32,219
would intend it again it all depends on

176
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:34,080
the size and density of those buds and

177
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:36,180
how long it takes them to dry how much

178
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:38,219
moisture is in those buds at the time of

179
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:40,439
harvest some people water their plants

180
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:41,430
up till the day of harvest some folks

181
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:43,319
will water

182
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:45,840
chopped down tonight some people will

183
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:48,000
still water today some people will stop

184
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:49,379
watering a few days before harvest to

185
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,569
kind of speed up the dry and cure

186
00:06:49,379 --> 00:06:52,949
process but I think you're going to do

187
00:06:51,569 --> 00:06:54,959
great because you were smart enough to

188
00:06:52,949 --> 00:06:55,909
ask this question you've already got the

189
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:57,989
right idea

190
00:06:55,910 --> 00:07:00,030
congratulations on your first harvest I

191
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:01,560
hope it goes well if you are comfortable

192
00:07:00,029 --> 00:07:03,839
with it I would love to see some photos

193
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,910
and then I really look forward to seeing

194
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:08,579
how we can improve your garden next time

195
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:10,290
through just one cycle of practice one

196
00:07:08,579 --> 00:07:11,729
cycle of trial and error and then you

197
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:13,530
get a few more episodes of the show

198
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:15,030
under your belt you've probably got some

199
00:07:13,529 --> 00:07:17,369
confidence now that you've got one

200
00:07:15,029 --> 00:07:19,409
successful harvest I really look forward

201
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:21,660
to seeing how you improve in your next

202
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:23,730
cycle so good luck with the next run I

203
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:25,260
hope this harvest cycle goes well I hope

204
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:27,750
you dry and cure it properly please

205
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:29,159
listen to the dry and cure episode and

206
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:31,050
if you've got any questions about the

207
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:33,300
dry and cure or about your next cycle

208
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:35,129
please send me more emails I would love

209
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:38,040
to help you out once again big shout out

210
00:07:35,129 --> 00:07:39,569
to my new buddy dude dank UK from over

211
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,640
there in England thank you for all of

212
00:07:39,569 --> 00:07:44,069
the patreon support and again thank you

213
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:46,019
for the great message alright now we're

214
00:07:44,069 --> 00:07:47,790
going to work on some listen or emails

215
00:07:46,019 --> 00:07:49,859
this one came straight to the Grove from

216
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:52,290
your heart at hotmail.com email address

217
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:53,699
this one goes a lot like this it says

218
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:55,319
what's up Russ - Jeff

219
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:56,670
my name is we're gonna skip the names

220
00:07:55,319 --> 00:08:01,319
I'm not sure if they want me to say that

221
00:07:56,670 --> 00:08:03,660
but the message goes just like this my

222
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:05,670
father-in-law to be passed during a

223
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:08,100
heart valve replacement just two months

224
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:10,500
before my upcoming wedding wow that's

225
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:12,870
heavy I am sorry to hear that the

226
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:15,600
message goes on to say he had a way with

227
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:17,579
any and all plants a true mr. green

228
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:20,250
thumb' and he was growing some cannabis

229
00:08:17,579 --> 00:08:21,990
outdoors tucked into his garden bed to

230
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,589
gift out to his friends after the

231
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:24,540
harvest

232
00:08:22,589 --> 00:08:28,139
he doesn't even smoke anymore he just

233
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:29,670
loves this plant that's wonderful and

234
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:31,860
terrible it sounds like you lost a

235
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:34,529
wonderful person the message goes on to

236
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:36,930
say due to the fact that his wife would

237
00:08:34,529 --> 00:08:38,939
not have taken it well or appreciated it

238
00:08:36,929 --> 00:08:41,729
if she stumbled across the plants his

239
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:44,370
daughter my fiance and I had to perform

240
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:47,100
operation get the [ __ ] out of Dodge and

241
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:49,259
saved these plants from being found this

242
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:51,269
is kind of a sad tale but it is taking a

243
00:08:49,259 --> 00:08:53,549
very interesting twist this is almost

244
00:08:51,269 --> 00:08:55,838
like a a Hollywood movie but I would go

245
00:08:53,549 --> 00:08:58,159
watch so let's keep going it's

246
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,959
obviously we have taken on the task of

247
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:02,299
finishing this round and I am keeping

248
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:04,489
them indoors to finish flowering as they

249
00:09:02,299 --> 00:09:06,620
have vastly outgrown my tent limits and

250
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:08,688
they're doing amazingly with the organic

251
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:10,578
soil additives which I have been adding

252
00:09:08,688 --> 00:09:14,088
as well as worm castings from our

253
00:09:10,578 --> 00:09:15,948
personal worm composting bin to keep the

254
00:09:14,089 --> 00:09:18,319
memory of this amazing man alive I am

255
00:09:15,948 --> 00:09:20,778
attempting to keep these genetics going

256
00:09:18,318 --> 00:09:22,998
by cloning these plants I have very

257
00:09:20,778 --> 00:09:25,789
minimal experience with growing but I

258
00:09:22,999 --> 00:09:27,620
have never attempted cloning alright so

259
00:09:25,789 --> 00:09:30,289
let's talk about where we are so far on

260
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:33,318
this this person was getting married and

261
00:09:30,289 --> 00:09:35,958
their fiance's father-in-law passed

262
00:09:33,318 --> 00:09:37,969
during a heart valve replacement this

263
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:40,128
man who passed was growing cannabis in

264
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:42,860
his outdoor garden to share with his

265
00:09:40,129 --> 00:09:44,688
friends this man's daughter and new

266
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:47,959
son-in-law have taken it upon themselves

267
00:09:44,688 --> 00:09:49,938
to rescue this plant not only for the

268
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:51,799
sake of the cannabis plant to preserve

269
00:09:49,938 --> 00:09:54,558
the plant and preserve its genetics but

270
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:56,778
also to preserve the past man's

271
00:09:54,558 --> 00:09:58,399
reputation because nobody knew he was

272
00:09:56,778 --> 00:10:00,438
growing and it would have made him look

273
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,600
bad so they got the plant the [ __ ] out

274
00:10:00,438 --> 00:10:04,938
of there they took it indoors now they

275
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:07,790
are attempting to clone this plant to

276
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:09,980
preserve the father's genetics to

277
00:10:07,789 --> 00:10:12,889
preserve his work so let's catch up into

278
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:14,990
the email it says when we saved them

279
00:10:12,889 --> 00:10:19,009
they were already showing pre flowers so

280
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:21,079
I cut clones ASAP I used sterile blades

281
00:10:19,009 --> 00:10:23,449
I follow your method is described in the

282
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:25,458
podcast dipped into rooting hormones and

283
00:10:23,448 --> 00:10:27,528
placed the cuttings into root riot cubes

284
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:29,768
but I soaked in distilled water and then

285
00:10:27,528 --> 00:10:32,448
squeezed the excess water out of I

286
00:10:29,769 --> 00:10:34,759
purchased all necessities for a tent set

287
00:10:32,448 --> 00:10:38,178
up and got the clones a 7 inch dome

288
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:39,919
under my LED light I do have a seedling

289
00:10:38,178 --> 00:10:41,688
mat running due to the fact that it's in

290
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:44,058
my basement in the cold New York

291
00:10:41,688 --> 00:10:45,799
concrete the tray is off the ground with

292
00:10:44,058 --> 00:10:48,438
the mat just below providing minimal

293
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:50,058
heat instead of direct contact alright

294
00:10:48,438 --> 00:10:51,740
so the plants were starting to show pre

295
00:10:50,058 --> 00:10:53,808
flower so they decided to cut clones

296
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:55,730
that is okay you've got great success

297
00:10:53,808 --> 00:10:57,769
rate from clones at that point they

298
00:10:55,730 --> 00:11:00,289
purchased all of the equipment they used

299
00:10:57,769 --> 00:11:02,360
sterile blades they followed my method

300
00:11:00,289 --> 00:11:04,250
they dipped the clones into rooting

301
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:06,230
hormones and place them into root riot

302
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:08,778
cubes they were soaked in distilled

303
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:09,110
water so far the distilled water is the

304
00:11:08,778 --> 00:11:10,970
only

305
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:12,889
part that's got me concerned then we

306
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:15,350
talk about the LED light that should be

307
00:11:12,889 --> 00:11:16,789
okay the heat Matt we may want a little

308
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:18,620
bit more heat I don't know the

309
00:11:16,789 --> 00:11:20,958
temperature in there but if it's a cold

310
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:22,879
New York basement we may want that heat

311
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:23,838
directly under those clones just to give

312
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:26,240
them a little umph

313
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:28,100
but again I don't have a thermometer I'm

314
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,990
not there I can't tell you exactly how

315
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:32,389
cold it is I'm just guessing there is

316
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:34,159
more to the message though it goes on to

317
00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:36,828
say it has been about four weeks and I

318
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:38,689
still do not have roots the leaves are

319
00:11:36,828 --> 00:11:40,819
beginning to turn slightly yellow but

320
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:43,940
everything else looks healthy the

321
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:46,399
humidity is kept high between 75 and 90

322
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:48,140
percent the dome is constantly sweating

323
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:51,589
and I spray the inside of the dome down

324
00:11:48,139 --> 00:11:53,539
with water pH to around 6 to 6.5 when it

325
00:11:51,589 --> 00:11:55,519
dries all right I may have gone a little

326
00:11:53,539 --> 00:11:59,179
lower on the pH there I may have gotten

327
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:01,159
closer to 6 and not as close to 6 5 the

328
00:11:59,179 --> 00:12:03,049
humidity I think you're doing okay it

329
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:05,328
says the temperature is kept between 70

330
00:12:03,049 --> 00:12:07,958
and 80 between day and night and I have

331
00:12:05,328 --> 00:12:10,849
the lights set on an 18-6 time schedule

332
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:13,518
so I may have gone just a touch warmer I

333
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:16,550
may have gone closer to 75 to 85 and I

334
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:18,139
would have gone 24 hours a day of light

335
00:12:16,549 --> 00:12:20,778
I would never have given them any dark

336
00:12:18,139 --> 00:12:22,730
time until I saw roots probably until I

337
00:12:20,778 --> 00:12:24,948
transplant them but that's okay it was

338
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:27,500
your first try you did a great job

339
00:12:24,948 --> 00:12:29,809
trying it goes on to say the lights are

340
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:31,610
placed about 26 inches above the top of

341
00:12:29,809 --> 00:12:33,679
the dome I would have gone much closer I

342
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:35,389
almost let's see I'm gonna read about

343
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:38,629
your light I'm using a multi spectrum

344
00:12:35,389 --> 00:12:40,639
LED 600 watt equivalent with only the

345
00:12:38,629 --> 00:12:42,828
veg spectrum activated at this time also

346
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:45,169
I am not using any nutrients okay your

347
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:47,208
life may be correctly the correct

348
00:12:45,169 --> 00:12:49,458
distance since you're using an LED if it

349
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:50,869
were a t5 I'd go much closer it sounds

350
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:52,669
like your LED may be right

351
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:54,828
one thing I would do is put my hand

352
00:12:52,669 --> 00:12:56,569
right at the top of the dome and feel

353
00:12:54,828 --> 00:12:58,278
the heat is your hand comfortable there

354
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:59,870
do you want to move your hand if you

355
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:01,458
want to move your hand it is too warm if

356
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:03,259
you can just leave your hand there then

357
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:06,018
that light is not cooking the plants it

358
00:13:03,259 --> 00:13:08,629
is probably okay now it does say I am

359
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:11,299
not using any nutrients at this time

360
00:13:08,629 --> 00:13:13,159
with the distilled water and the rapid

361
00:13:11,299 --> 00:13:16,250
rooters and the lack of nutrients and

362
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:17,899
the 18:6 light schedule and probably a

363
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:20,480
little bit of cold I'm going to say

364
00:13:17,899 --> 00:13:21,690
those things are what added up to a lack

365
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,340
of roots

366
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:26,010
the message goes on to say could this

367
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:28,200
slow root growth be due to the fact that

368
00:13:26,009 --> 00:13:29,939
the plants were in flower when cut I

369
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:32,129
really don't think that has anything to

370
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:34,110
do with it a lot of times some growers

371
00:13:32,129 --> 00:13:35,909
like to take their cuts from plants

372
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:38,100
which are in flower and then revert

373
00:13:35,909 --> 00:13:40,529
those to veg because it does make really

374
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:43,019
monstrous clones ayah says are my lights

375
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:45,299
too close I am not familiar with your

376
00:13:43,019 --> 00:13:46,350
particular light it sounds like you've

377
00:13:45,299 --> 00:13:49,109
got the right idea

378
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:50,820
with it being 26 inches above the top of

379
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:53,100
the dome you've got only the veg

380
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:54,450
spectrum activated it should be right

381
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:56,759
like I said put your hand underneath

382
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:58,440
there see if it feels too warm I don't

383
00:13:56,759 --> 00:14:01,080
think you're cooking them with the light

384
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:03,900
but honestly I am not familiar with the

385
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:06,300
LED and I'm not sure how strong that 600

386
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:08,220
LED is for those clones I don't have

387
00:14:06,299 --> 00:14:10,049
that experience that could be part of

388
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:12,540
the problem it doesn't sound like it to

389
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:14,250
me from what I'm reading the message

390
00:14:12,539 --> 00:14:16,500
goes on to say is there anything else

391
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:19,200
that you could see me doing incorrectly

392
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:20,970
from this information yes like I

393
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:23,070
mentioned before I definitely would have

394
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:24,810
some nutrients in those rapid rooters

395
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:26,700
and I would definitely be feeding the

396
00:14:24,809 --> 00:14:28,739
plants some sort of feed when you were

397
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:31,140
spraying the dome I would have some

398
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:32,460
light nutrients in that water when you

399
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:34,740
were spraying the dome that is how the

400
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:36,629
plants are going to get fed they don't

401
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:38,340
have any roots so they're relying on the

402
00:14:36,629 --> 00:14:40,379
leaves to catch that foliar feed and

403
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:41,850
keep them alive until they do root so

404
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:44,429
that would have been very beneficial to

405
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:46,409
put some nutrients in that spray when

406
00:14:44,429 --> 00:14:47,789
you were misting the domes and then I

407
00:14:46,409 --> 00:14:50,189
think a little bit of heat would have

408
00:14:47,789 --> 00:14:52,529
helped you and then having it on a 24

409
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:53,460
hour light schedule definitely would

410
00:14:52,529 --> 00:14:55,230
have helped out that would have

411
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:57,930
encouraged roots to happen much more

412
00:14:55,230 --> 00:15:00,240
quickly unfortunately if it has been

413
00:14:57,929 --> 00:15:02,250
four weeks since these clones were cut I

414
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,680
would start losing faith in them very

415
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:06,149
soon I don't keep anything around for

416
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:08,819
four weeks if it doesn't root by the

417
00:15:06,149 --> 00:15:10,559
third week it is goodbye in my garden I

418
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:12,420
do understand that these plants are

419
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:15,269
special to you they're probably worth

420
00:15:12,419 --> 00:15:16,889
another week of trying I would add some

421
00:15:15,269 --> 00:15:18,689
nutrients to that foliar feed that

422
00:15:16,889 --> 00:15:21,149
you're giving them on the dome dries out

423
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:23,790
I'm a rewarder those plugs with

424
00:15:21,149 --> 00:15:25,649
something that's got a liquid beneficial

425
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:26,939
bacteria some sort of a root inoculant

426
00:15:25,649 --> 00:15:29,189
in there if you can get some liquid

427
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:30,870
great white maybe some mammoth pee just

428
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:32,340
to get some beneficial fungus into those

429
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:35,200
clones and encourage some root growth

430
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:38,410
and one mistake that a lot of new clone

431
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:40,720
make is they try to keep those plugs way

432
00:15:38,409 --> 00:15:42,909
too wet for way too long give them an

433
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,620
opportunity to kind of dry out you don't

434
00:15:42,909 --> 00:15:46,600
want them dry and brittle but when they

435
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:49,179
start to get dry is when you were most

436
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:50,920
likely to get roots popping it's a funny

437
00:15:49,179 --> 00:15:52,899
joke amongst growers that you say yeah

438
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:55,179
the best way to get my clones to root is

439
00:15:52,899 --> 00:15:56,620
to forget about them you go ah [ __ ] I

440
00:15:55,179 --> 00:15:58,419
haven't checked on my clones in like two

441
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:59,470
or three days and you go look at them

442
00:15:58,419 --> 00:16:01,299
and they're starting to get a little bit

443
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:03,190
dry and they're finally starting to root

444
00:16:01,299 --> 00:16:05,139
like a son of a [ __ ] so a little bit of

445
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:08,050
dryness may help you out again

446
00:16:05,139 --> 00:16:09,429
unfortunately I feel like four weeks has

447
00:16:08,049 --> 00:16:11,529
passed the limit they're probably

448
00:16:09,429 --> 00:16:13,089
starting to get a little bit of mold or

449
00:16:11,529 --> 00:16:15,490
rot where they're stuck into the clone

450
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:18,160
plugs they're probably losing life that

451
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:20,379
is probably game over for these clones I

452
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:22,419
hate to be the bearer of bad news but it

453
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:24,820
is probably too late to get these to

454
00:16:22,419 --> 00:16:26,500
root now I know we really wanted to keep

455
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:28,150
these genetics around because these were

456
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:30,429
plants that came from a very special

457
00:16:28,149 --> 00:16:32,230
person he obviously had a good heart he

458
00:16:30,429 --> 00:16:34,959
was growing cannabis in his garden

459
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:36,550
secretly he doesn't even smoke maybe he

460
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:38,560
secretly smokes too and we just don't

461
00:16:36,549 --> 00:16:40,419
know that but he says he doesn't smoke

462
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:42,279
and he was passing out this herb to his

463
00:16:40,419 --> 00:16:44,949
friends to be a good person to share

464
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:47,139
with people that is super kind what that

465
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:49,330
makes me think is that this is the kind

466
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:52,090
of guy that has probably got some seeds

467
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:54,850
stashed somewhere amongst his personal

468
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:57,340
possessions somewhere in this man's area

469
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:59,470
every old guy has an area if it's your

470
00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:01,840
workshop if it's your chair if it's your

471
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:03,759
stool every old guy's got a space as we

472
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:05,559
get older our space gets smaller all of

473
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:07,539
our [ __ ] ends up right here so we don't

474
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:09,730
have to go anywhere to get it that old

475
00:17:07,539 --> 00:17:12,578
guy has probably got some good seeds

476
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:14,529
stashed away somewhere and I encourage

477
00:17:12,578 --> 00:17:16,690
you to find those seeds and I hope you

478
00:17:14,529 --> 00:17:18,549
get to grow those seeds to honor your

479
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:20,470
father-in-law now there is one more

480
00:17:18,549 --> 00:17:22,240
sentence to this message and it says if

481
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:24,610
you need any further information or

482
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,109
pictures let me know I've learned so

483
00:17:24,609 --> 00:17:28,240
much listening to your grow lesson

484
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:30,250
series of podcasts during work you are

485
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,809
the [ __ ] man hey thank you I

486
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:33,460
appreciate that it sounds like your

487
00:17:31,809 --> 00:17:35,559
father involves the [ __ ] man too so

488
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:37,690
big shout out to him says I appreciate

489
00:17:35,559 --> 00:17:39,519
