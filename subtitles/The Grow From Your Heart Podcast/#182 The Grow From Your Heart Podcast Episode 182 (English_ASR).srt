1
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:06,129
it would have podcast world its Rasta

2
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:08,138
Jeff a lot of people have been asking

3
00:00:06,129 --> 00:00:09,669
for all episodes of the podcast that are

4
00:00:08,138 --> 00:00:11,649
no longer available in the iTunes and

5
00:00:09,669 --> 00:00:13,298
stitcher feed I decided to put old

6
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:15,160
episodes together in large chunks and

7
00:00:13,298 --> 00:00:16,778
throw them back into the feed so that

8
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:19,839
you can enjoy them without interrupting

9
00:00:16,778 --> 00:00:21,100
the current podcast schedule before we

10
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:22,390
get into the old episodes that are a

11
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:24,730
couple of things I should tell you up

12
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:27,070
until episode 50 the show was called the

13
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:29,130
iGrow culture podcast I changed the name

14
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:31,449
to grow from your heart at episode 50

15
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:33,070
also I should make a disclaimer that I

16
00:00:31,449 --> 00:00:34,929
have learned a lot in a hundred and

17
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:36,880
eighty episodes of podcasting so some of

18
00:00:34,929 --> 00:00:39,070
my ideas and opinions at the start of

19
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,260
the show may be strongly different from

20
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:43,149
my opinions now and in the future so

21
00:00:41,259 --> 00:00:45,759
don't hold anything against me all right

22
00:00:43,149 --> 00:00:47,289
you guys episode 1 is probably quite

23
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:49,119

00:03:35,318 --> 00:03:37,729
some good hash he keeps me supplied with

75
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:41,569
my head

76
00:03:37,729 --> 00:03:42,738
- and it's pretty epic so uh what do you

77
00:03:41,568 --> 00:03:44,238
like to smoke bro when you're looking

78
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:47,060
flowers do you like smoke in the Khazar

79
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:51,080
sativas I like in because I'm a huge fan

80
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:52,189
of blueberry and some deadhead OG I know

81
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:54,530
a guy that girl some pretty killer

82
00:03:52,189 --> 00:03:57,229
deadhead OG I know one myself

83
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:58,400
alright I usually ask people I want to

84
00:03:57,229 --> 00:03:59,628
ask people if their medical or direct

85
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,209
patient but I know you I know you're a

86
00:03:59,628 --> 00:04:03,649
medical patient yes sir do you find a

87
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:06,829
line between medicating and wreck

88
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:09,769
creating sometimes I do because it

89
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:12,769
doesn't it doesn't really take very much

90
00:04:09,769 --> 00:04:17,720
to medicate and to make myself feel

91
00:04:12,769 --> 00:04:20,449
better and to help my ailments to get

92
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:22,610
really stoned and I go beyond that and

93
00:04:20,449 --> 00:04:25,280
write smoke more than I actually need

94
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:27,169
but it helps my head a lot would I do

95
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:29,629
that so like your vibe your attitude

96
00:04:27,168 --> 00:04:31,359
yeah helps understandable aura and it

97
00:04:29,629 --> 00:04:34,459
helps me to sleep a lot if I

98
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,900
overmedicate in the evenings so so it's

99
00:04:34,459 --> 00:04:39,620
not over medicating it's perfectly my

100
00:04:35,899 --> 00:04:43,189
idea yeah yeah right drug isn't light

101
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:44,269
it's just better dude over here to my

102
00:04:43,189 --> 00:04:45,800
left that's my buddy Mike we're gonna

103
00:04:44,269 --> 00:04:51,319
ask him how long have you been smoking

104
00:04:45,800 --> 00:05:01,069
weed bro well somebody who's got to do

105
00:04:51,319 --> 00:05:02,240
math for us how your are you do you

106
00:05:01,069 --> 00:05:04,519
consider yourself a medical or

107
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,410
recreational smoker ah for a good chunk

108
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:08,089
of that it was completely recreational

109
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:10,430
it was just some fun I did occasionally

110
00:05:08,089 --> 00:05:12,228
with friends and then I injured a couple

111
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:14,329
of years ago working I hurt my neck real

112
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:16,430
bad and messed up some of the discs in

113
00:05:14,329 --> 00:05:18,949
my neck and had some nerve generated

114
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:21,319
pain is what the fancy doctor folks

115
00:05:18,949 --> 00:05:22,759
would call it and cannabis works a lot

116
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:25,519
better than the pain pills they had me

117
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:27,740
on and that was really my personal entry

118
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:30,889
into the medical world and so now it's

119
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:32,990
it's both I would say but the regular

120
00:05:30,889 --> 00:05:34,668
use of cannabis is definitely medical

121
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:37,129
rather than recognizing great that for

122
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:38,870
sure nice it was recreational I probably

123
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:41,509
had some joints on the weekend or

124
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:44,120
something but the definite consistent

125
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:45,740
use is medical for sure okay

126
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:49,189
like there's definitely a line between

127
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:50,360
when the pain stops and any sort of

128
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:53,000
enjoyment or energy

129
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:54,889
it begins and they go game time or

130
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,769
whatever yeah that lines easy to feel

131
00:05:54,889 --> 00:06:00,590
it's you can tell when okay the my my

132
00:05:57,769 --> 00:06:03,049
pain is gone I can get up I can do what

133
00:06:00,589 --> 00:06:04,549
I've got to do for the day and then you

134
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:06,800
can kind of feel the pain slowly coming

135
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:09,530
back and go medicate a little bit more

136
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,689
the pain goes away and they'll the line

137
00:06:09,529 --> 00:06:13,848
before you become intoxicated is really

138
00:06:11,689 --> 00:06:17,710
easy to walk for me but when I get home

139
00:06:13,848 --> 00:06:20,598
and wanna unwind definitely recreational

140
00:06:17,709 --> 00:06:22,579
okay dabs from your recreation I go

141
00:06:20,598 --> 00:06:25,430
right past medicated into happy okay

142
00:06:22,579 --> 00:06:27,468
that's a good that's the opposite dabs

143
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:30,408
for me are very medical I have a lot of

144
00:06:27,468 --> 00:06:32,329
respiratory issues and smoking the herb

145
00:06:30,408 --> 00:06:33,709
really gets to be smoking a lot of weed

146
00:06:32,329 --> 00:06:35,628
really gets to me

147
00:06:33,709 --> 00:06:37,938
so doing the dabs and not having to

148
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:39,979
smoke so much and now that we've learned

149
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:41,419
about dewaxing and all that stuff and

150
00:06:39,978 --> 00:06:43,878
getting a lot of that plant matter out

151
00:06:41,418 --> 00:06:46,788
of it has really helped me to not be

152
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:48,860
congested or wheeze all the time and you

153
00:06:46,788 --> 00:06:51,528
know that's if I'm doing quality dabs

154
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:53,870
but I notice if you dude some dirty

155
00:06:51,528 --> 00:06:56,870
stuff that kind of hinders that a little

156
00:06:53,870 --> 00:07:04,819
bit but my me and I sorry to interrupt

157
00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:07,038
you just made me think it dirty stuff so

158
00:07:04,819 --> 00:07:08,658
I met Mike basically he started coming

159
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:10,459
to the dispensary I worked at and

160
00:07:08,658 --> 00:07:13,848
managed whatever I had a lot of roles

161
00:07:10,459 --> 00:07:17,138
there and he got to see the evolution of

162
00:07:13,848 --> 00:07:19,550
dirty stuff come to what it is now yeah

163
00:07:17,139 --> 00:07:20,990
remember some of the junk we used to see

164
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:23,569
come to that dispensary people would try

165
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:24,949
to pass off his ear wax or judean each

166
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:26,629
oh they were calling it butter because

167
00:07:24,949 --> 00:07:30,639
it was goopy and sir

168
00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:35,479
the first time I was handed ear wax was

169
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:37,490
black tar in a coke vial and the guy

170
00:07:35,478 --> 00:07:40,310
said this is earwax hash and handed it

171
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:42,800
to me and I looked him in the face and I

172
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:44,930
was new at the shop so my automatic

173
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,060
response to insult the product that I

174
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:49,250
was just handed had to be gut checked

175
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:52,189
and kind of held in reserve and I just

176
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:54,528
kind of nodded and put it back like on

177
00:07:52,189 --> 00:07:56,270
the Shelf I didn't feel like I could say

178
00:07:54,528 --> 00:07:59,050
anything there but good lord like the

179
00:07:56,269 --> 00:08:02,278
quality of hash in the last six years is

180
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:04,079
lightyears ahead of where it was yeah

181
00:08:02,278 --> 00:08:06,928
definitely the stuff little keV brings

182
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:09,239
back for me is freakin impressive yeah

183
00:08:06,928 --> 00:08:10,948
yeah that's I mean you got to think a

184
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:13,168
lot of the whole community for doing

185
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:16,079
that for us everyone sharing knowledge

186
00:08:13,168 --> 00:08:17,818
with each other and you know being being

187
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:21,288
fairly open with each other and people

188
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:24,379
being willing to to read and learn and

189
00:08:21,288 --> 00:08:26,548
gain that knowledge has really you know

190
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:27,959
made that happen I heard you say

191
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:29,188
something interesting ago today and I

192
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:32,490
want you get closer to the mic just for

193
00:08:29,189 --> 00:08:35,819
this one something if I want to get into

194
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:37,019
hash what's the first step gonna make a

195
00:08:35,818 --> 00:08:40,078
sh sorry not getting into it if I want

196
00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:43,198
to make make my own a BHO go to a school

197
00:08:40,078 --> 00:08:44,938
or a library and grab a basic organic

198
00:08:43,198 --> 00:08:48,359
chemistry book and sit down and read

199
00:08:44,938 --> 00:08:50,338
that [ __ ] and then introduce the

200
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,839
Cannabis later once you understand what

201
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:52,350
you're dealing with and how to respect

202
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,829
it

203
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:58,230
see I think that's a good approach and

204
00:08:55,828 --> 00:09:00,149
then after that read some forums and

205
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:01,769
don't watch a single video until you

206
00:09:00,149 --> 00:09:03,480
have an understanding and you feel like

207
00:09:01,769 --> 00:09:05,578
you could do it on your own and make a

208
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:07,649
batch or two if you feel confident and

209
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:09,088
you have done those steps and done the

210
00:09:07,649 --> 00:09:10,889
reading and gained the knowledge and

211
00:09:09,089 --> 00:09:12,930
then watch videos after you've already

212
00:09:10,889 --> 00:09:15,930
tried it because there's so much stupid

213
00:09:12,929 --> 00:09:19,818
[ __ ] that people do in those two minute

214
00:09:15,929 --> 00:09:22,349
videos making a good batch of dabs

215
00:09:19,818 --> 00:09:26,698
doesn't take two minutes I don't care

216
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:28,920
what your that's why I recommend doing

217
00:09:26,698 --> 00:09:30,389
the reading and the research I've waited

218
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:32,429
two or three days for this do to bring

219
00:09:30,389 --> 00:09:34,259
me back cabs it's like the longer I wait

220
00:09:32,429 --> 00:09:37,558
the better they are yeah so it's well

221
00:09:34,259 --> 00:09:38,879
worth it yep by all means people do your

222
00:09:37,558 --> 00:09:40,769
homework the only reason people are

223
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:43,079
getting hurt trying to make dabs is

224
00:09:40,769 --> 00:09:45,209
because they heard about it from a

225
00:09:43,078 --> 00:09:46,558
friend and the friend didn't really know

226
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:47,938
what they were talking about and then

227
00:09:46,558 --> 00:09:49,558
they ran to the parts store bought a

228
00:09:47,938 --> 00:09:52,078
bunch of flannel flammable chemicals

229
00:09:49,558 --> 00:09:53,578
took them into an enclosed space and set

230
00:09:52,078 --> 00:09:56,128
all the feelings on fire I've talked to

231
00:09:53,578 --> 00:09:58,948
be the dumbest [ __ ] ever if you do any

232
00:09:56,129 --> 00:10:00,360
any research at all you learn how to not

233
00:09:58,948 --> 00:10:04,318
blow yourself up in the first two

234
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:08,240
minutes it's about respecting what

235
00:10:04,318 --> 00:10:10,948
you're dealing with don't blast in doors

236
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,500
my number one piece of advice that do

237
00:10:10,948 --> 00:10:17,089
not blast indoors

238
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:19,100
it's ridiculous so what uh for you keV

239
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:20,629
what's uh what kind of mark do you want

240
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:24,649
to leave on the cannabis industry or the

241
00:10:20,629 --> 00:10:28,279
society or cannabis world I'd like to

242
00:10:24,649 --> 00:10:30,470
just keep continuing with the main the

243
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:35,089
main attitude that most of us have and

244
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:38,180
just continue that positive positive

245
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:39,980
outlook and that positive view from the

246
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:42,319
people as well you know just keep

247
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:44,149
gaining that doing everything as best I

248
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:47,000
can with the most knowledge and learning

249
00:10:44,149 --> 00:10:48,980
everything as it comes to light as

250
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,330
everything's changing just always keep

251
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:51,649
up with that and share that with the

252
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:53,509
people around me because that's how we

253
00:10:51,649 --> 00:10:56,120
get better yeah by sharing your

254
00:10:53,509 --> 00:11:00,019
knowledge that we have for sure that's

255
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:01,220
how we prevent blowing up I know you're

256
00:11:00,019 --> 00:11:02,480
doing a lot of work in the cannabis

257
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,950
industry you're not uh you're not a girl

258
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,960
you're not a hash maker but you're on

259
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:12,110
the other end you're uh you're the

260
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:13,280
computer nerd that we all need your do a

261
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:15,080
lot of stuff from what I know on the

262
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,639
HuffPost I see tweeting a lot of cool

263
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:18,830
stuff about cannabis you're an activist

264
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:26,929
in my mind that's part of why I wanted

265
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:29,060
to have you on my show do to speak for

266
00:11:26,929 --> 00:11:31,009
us you're well-written well-spoken yeah

267
00:11:29,059 --> 00:11:33,469
I like to think of the last five years

268
00:11:31,009 --> 00:11:35,840
is working on a doctorate in cannabis

269
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:38,360
but other people might call it

270
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:41,300
unemployed or self-employed or weed

271
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:45,980
employed it kind of employed I'm kind of

272
00:11:41,299 --> 00:11:47,209
employed so what kind of mark do you

273
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:48,800
want to leave like when when you're gone

274
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:50,420
when the earth blows up and somebody

275
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:52,399
reads a book about Mike what do you want

276
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:55,069
it to say honestly it would be amazing

277
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:57,679
if my name was in some of the history

278
00:11:55,070 --> 00:12:00,500
books as part of this huge experiment

279
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:02,539
going on in Colorado right now about one

280
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:04,610
of the first big names to do it

281
00:12:02,539 --> 00:12:05,959
incredibly right and if I could just put

282
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:09,279
you two in a warehouse and chained you

283
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:11,780
there for a year like that would be done

284
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:13,279
Mike Rowe in the front me on the grow

285
00:12:11,779 --> 00:12:14,990
keV on the hat right if I could just

286
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:17,750
enslave you to and keep Jeff in the

287
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:19,220
garden and Kev in the hash room and I'd

288
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:20,690
have to chain myself to the front desk

289
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:21,879
to if they can't believe I can't believe

290
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:23,440
this is fair

291
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:26,409
but if that could happen my name would

292
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,690
fully be cemented in history is is the

293
00:12:26,409 --> 00:12:30,850
[ __ ] golden Coors brewery of southern

294
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:32,560
Colorado I know that for a fact that

295
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:35,379
would be way cool there'd be way cool to

296
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:37,049
have my brothers accomplish that sort of

297
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:40,059
thing that would be a lot of fun yeah

298
00:12:37,049 --> 00:12:41,349
definitely be so much fun to playing in

299
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:52,919
the mountain and just saw weed with you

300
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:52,920
to for the rest of his life we have some

301
00:12:54,299 --> 00:13:23,769
better songs but yes I like the idea of

302
00:12:57,068 --> 00:13:26,980
Loompas little people and that was a

303
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:28,568
free promo if you're a meat eater and

304
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:34,810
want a weed job I suppose you should

305
00:13:28,568 --> 00:13:36,698
call me I'm one of those hippie types

306
00:13:34,809 --> 00:13:38,469
y'all I don't need any animals got a

307
00:13:36,698 --> 00:13:41,198
bunch of people that just met us or just

308
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:43,870
he doesn't mean grilled cheese but by

309
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:47,019
that folks that doesn't count I like

310
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:49,149
some falafel and hippy [ __ ] man all

311
00:13:47,019 --> 00:13:51,789
right well we had a topic we want to

312
00:13:49,149 --> 00:13:54,100
discuss put it back on a serious note

313
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:56,349
here a recent article that came out

314
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:59,199
written by Ricardo Baca in the Denver

315
00:13:56,350 --> 00:14:01,000
Post an independent Denver Post study of

316
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:04,120
several marijuana infused product shows

317
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:08,309
wide variances in THC levels and edibles

318
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:10,480
versus labeling so what that means is uh

319
00:14:08,309 --> 00:14:13,059
apparently they acquired some edibles

320
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,949
and they took them to a testing facility

321
00:14:13,059 --> 00:14:19,149
they took them to Steve Hill Halen labs

322
00:14:14,948 --> 00:14:20,979
and they tested them and the labels did

323
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:23,470
not match the test finding so on read a

324
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:24,850
little bit further for you guys before I

325
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:26,709
do I had a couple dabs before the show

326
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:28,689
sorry about the the wobbly voice trying

327
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:30,399
to read out loud on the on a microphone

328
00:14:28,688 --> 00:14:32,230

329
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,419

chocolate

332
00:14:34,909 --> 00:14:38,569
caramels and candies but many of the

333
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:40,819
company's products contain only a minut

334
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:43,070
fraction of the THC promised on dr. J's

335
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:47,180
labels according to independent tests

336
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:48,950
organized by the Denver Post 1 dr. J's

337

milk chocolate stars bar labeled for a

338
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:53,120
thousand milligrams of THC had and pay

339
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:55,159
attention here point three seven

340
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,320
milligrams of valued psychoactive

341
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:59,149
component according to three tests

342
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:01,160
conducted by steep hill Halon of

343
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:04,399
Colorado a state licensed marijuana

344
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:06,799
testing facility another dr. J's another

345
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:09,019
popular dr. J's chocolate bar the 100

346
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:10,459
milligram winter mint flavor the page is

347
00:15:09,019 --> 00:15:12,019
refreshing that's cute let me scroll the

348
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:15,110
heck down there we go winter mint flavor

349
00:15:12,019 --> 00:15:19,819
tested similarly in two experiments

350
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:23,330
showing 0.28 milligrams of THC so

351
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:25,670
basically these chocolate bars cost

352
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:27,889
about 10 bucks plus tax

353
00:15:25,669 --> 00:15:30,469
and they promised to have a hundred

354
00:15:27,889 --> 00:15:32,750
milligrams of THC in there and you

355
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:33,950
basically just bought a Hershey bar or I

356
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:35,750
can't I don't know shouldn't say a brand

357
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:37,580
name you bought a regular chocolate bar

358
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:39,529
off of the shelf is basically what you

359
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:42,020
got at least the regular dollar

360
00:15:39,529 --> 00:15:44,419
chocolate bar up by the register at the

361
00:15:42,019 --> 00:15:46,909
quick way is standardized and like

362
00:15:44,419 --> 00:15:48,139
there's always gonna be kind of what you

363
00:15:46,909 --> 00:15:50,179
ordered the stuff they're cooking in

364
00:15:48,139 --> 00:15:51,620
their kitchens if they can't get the THC

365
00:15:50,179 --> 00:15:54,199
that they're trying to put in it in it

366
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:55,909
does it even taste like food or taste

367
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,500
like blue leather dude it those numbers

368
00:15:55,909 --> 00:16:01,179
you need a hundred of those things to

369
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:07,039
get one normal 25 milligram dose right

370
00:16:01,179 --> 00:16:09,789
yeah at that point you've diabetes for

371
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:11,480
one dose so you're gonna have diabetes

372
00:16:09,789 --> 00:16:14,419
and funky

373
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:16,039
that's ridiculous so I'm gonna continue

374
00:16:14,419 --> 00:16:17,839

375

402
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:24,189
know that it's irresponsible but it's

403
00:17:21,869 --> 00:17:25,208
non-professional which is pretty much

404
00:17:24,189 --> 00:17:27,310
how I feel yeah

405
00:17:25,209 --> 00:17:29,410
the evolving marijuana industry is still

406
00:17:27,309 --> 00:17:31,389
finding its way in Colorado and one of

407
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:32,769
the evolving aspects is the testing or

408
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:34,570
lack thereof products the state

409
00:17:32,769 --> 00:17:36,639
marijuana Enforcement Division enacted

410
00:17:34,569 --> 00:17:38,230
new regulations last week and more

411
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,450
changes are to come in May and in

412
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:41,950
October for people that aren't from

413
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:44,350
Colorado or aren't familiar with all

414
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:47,019
this there's some mumbo jumbo and here

415
00:17:44,349 --> 00:17:49,990
the marijuana Enforcement Division that

416
00:17:47,019 --> 00:17:52,779
is the division that oversees all of the

417
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:55,480
dispensary regulations rules and taxing

418
00:17:52,779 --> 00:17:57,910
they're attached to the IRS they're able

419
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:59,289
to randomly show up at your dispensary

420
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,850
on any day that business is being

421
00:17:59,289 --> 00:18:02,440
conducted they can open up all your

422
00:18:00,849 --> 00:18:07,659
business records they can open up all

423
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:12,519
your saves saves safe so boxes where you

424
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:14,320
keep money they can open those parking

425
00:18:12,519 --> 00:18:15,819
lot everything cars in the parking lot

426
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:18,129
they go through the bathrooms if they

427
00:18:15,819 --> 00:18:20,349
feel like it if they find like a roach

428
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:21,730
or a pipe or something you can be in

429
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:24,159
trouble I don't know exactly what they

430
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:25,809
do about that but you can be screwed so

431
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,840
there are strict rules and everything in

432
00:18:25,809 --> 00:18:30,879
these medical and recreational centers

433
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:33,909
are under camera from there everything

434
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:35,580
yeah you walk in the door to the minute

435
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:38,070
you pay your money

436
00:18:35,579 --> 00:18:48,069
[Music]

437
00:18:38,069 --> 00:18:51,339
they require these cameras and read it

438
00:18:48,069 --> 00:18:52,929
perfectly so there yeah yeah they've got

439
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:55,149
their stuff under control and they're

440
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:57,519
just popping in and inspecting places so

441
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:58,900
that's that's the place that's involved

442
00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:00,339
and responsible for this and they're

443
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:01,509
coming out with new regulations all the

444
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:01,929
time they're trying to get it under

445
00:19:01,509 --> 00:19:04,359
control

446
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:05,680
so I'll continue the article but as the

447
00:19:04,359 --> 00:19:07,240
marijuana industry looks ahead to the

448
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:09,160
potential of regular mandatory testing

449
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:12,069
dr. J's problems seemed deeper than a

450
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:14,110
bad batch or two the two bars that both

451
00:19:12,069 --> 00:19:16,809
tested for less than 1/2 milligram of

452
00:19:14,109 --> 00:19:18,759
THC were purchased two months and 40

453
00:19:16,809 --> 00:19:22,169
miles apart from each other and they

454
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:25,210
were separated by 282 batches or roughly

455
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:26,830
70,000 units so this couldn't have been

456
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:30,640
just like a fluke batch or something

457
00:19:26,829 --> 00:19:32,769
this was this was definitely like yeah

458
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,750
this is all that that's that's [ __ ] up

459
00:19:32,769 --> 00:19:37,000
that's definitions their business model

460
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:40,150
being found out wide about it but it's

461
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,819
like if eleven of the twelve pop cans in

462
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:47,680
your 12-pack were empty or just full of

463
00:19:42,819 --> 00:19:49,149
water like yeah it's insane it's it's if

464
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:52,750
they're 200 batches apart that's a

465
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:56,830
business practice it's or a huge flaw in

466
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:58,450
their business practice is it minimum if

467
00:19:56,829 --> 00:20:03,569
you produce a hundred batches of

468
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:05,830
chocolate bars do it probably do it

469
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:13,149
playing with the toys in front of these

470
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:14,710
kids podcast the [ __ ] out shout out to

471

this through this article before we

477
00:20:23,019 --> 00:20:26,650
weren't too much you get distracted the

478
00:20:25,059 --> 00:20:28,419

said they won't carry them and the

484
00:20:37,299 --> 00:20:40,809
grousing has the attention of the

485
00:20:38,829 --> 00:20:42,159
medical marijuana Enforcement Division I

486
00:20:40,809 --> 00:20:43,960

try to drop that torch out of there

490
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:52,548
sorry Oh an independent Post study of

491
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:54,439
several products showed the THC levels

492
00:20:52,548 --> 00:20:57,019
and edibles are never exactly what the

493
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:57,730
package reads so that's never a good

494
00:20:57,019 --> 00:21:00,470
sign

495
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:02,538
that's never a good sign so mile heights

496
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:04,640
candies watermelon drops you're labeled

497
00:21:02,538 --> 00:21:08,210
labeled at 100 milligrams of THC but

498
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:10,100
they actually contained 17 that's a

499
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:12,410
failure in my mind that's a huge failure

500
00:21:10,099 --> 00:21:14,990
Incredibles Mile High mint chocolate bar

501
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:18,110
advertises 100 milligrams of THC but

502
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:19,370
instead included 146 now keep that in

503
00:21:18,109 --> 00:21:21,199
your mind for a minute so I want to read

504
00:21:19,369 --> 00:21:23,389
the next one big shout out to the

505
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,759
growing kitchen the growing kitchens

506
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:28,970
Chocolate Chunk cookie tested at 100

507
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:31,308
milligram 101 milligrams on our products

508
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:34,069
labeled for 100 so you were one

509
00:21:31,308 --> 00:21:36,379
milligram off which that's doing it

510
00:21:34,069 --> 00:21:37,668
right my opinion good job guys big love

511
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:39,650
to the growing kitchen check those guys

512
00:21:37,669 --> 00:21:40,159
out by their edibles the Chocolate Chunk

513
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:43,159
cookie

514
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:44,450
it's [ __ ] what it's at so something

515
00:21:43,159 --> 00:21:48,919
I've said to keep in your head

516
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:51,200
146 milligrams and an edible that's

517
00:21:48,919 --> 00:21:53,360
listed at a hundred for getting one and

518
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:56,870
a half times your dose I'm okay with

519
00:21:53,359 --> 00:22:00,099
that but you and me are but the general

520
00:21:56,869 --> 00:22:02,178
public that's I I'm a caregiver I am

521
00:22:00,099 --> 00:22:05,599
registered caregiver for five patients

522
00:22:02,179 --> 00:22:09,220
and I have two people that if I fed them

523
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:12,649
that they would probably get mad at me

524
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:16,579
it could definitely if I had stuff to do

525
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:18,650
that day and I was expecting say half of

526
00:22:16,579 --> 00:22:21,678
a hundred milligram dose to start my day

527
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:24,590
off with that I really got 75 instead of

528
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:26,900
50 by half a night that could mess up a

529
00:22:24,589 --> 00:22:30,470
good portion of my day this is medical

530
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:35,090
marijuana yeah tested product what if

531
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:37,159
this company gave me a vicodin and I

532
00:22:35,089 --> 00:22:39,609
just thought I took it's a 750

533
00:22:37,159 --> 00:22:41,780
milligrams just took what is that

534
00:22:39,609 --> 00:22:43,399
thousand milligrams right that's

535
00:22:41,779 --> 00:22:45,710
probably I'm gonna be [ __ ] up I can't

536
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:48,320
yeah right let's go to work now 1250

537
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:49,549
yeah whatever somebody were you guys get

538
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:53,168
the damn point please

539
00:22:49,549 --> 00:22:55,878
[Laughter]

540
00:22:53,169 --> 00:22:57,919
it's not a math Bowl I already forgot

541
00:22:55,878 --> 00:23:00,888
the numbers I said no this is a product

542
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:04,009
of the industry being on the fringe

543
00:23:00,888 --> 00:23:08,178
still it's we're only months removed

544
00:23:04,009 --> 00:23:11,210
from this industry completely the people

545
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:13,759
that went to school and learn the skills

546
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:16,460
that it takes to put an exact number of

547
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:20,659
milligrams of THC in a little fun sized

548
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:22,940
candy bar haven't moved into this

549
00:23:20,659 --> 00:23:24,979
industry and then numbers great enough

550
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:26,690
to really provide awesome product

551
00:23:24,979 --> 00:23:31,639
standards across the board with edibles

552
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:33,558
clearly who came in one above one off a

553
00:23:31,638 --> 00:23:35,088
growing kitchen the growing kitchen has

554
00:23:33,558 --> 00:23:37,158
got somebody who really knows what

555
00:23:35,088 --> 00:23:38,989
they're doing I understand that the the

556
00:23:37,159 --> 00:23:42,409
folks in charge of making the capsules

557
00:23:38,989 --> 00:23:44,269
and the oils of Charlotte's Web that

558
00:23:42,409 --> 00:23:46,849
were given to the kids with seizures of

559
00:23:44,269 --> 00:23:50,538
also taking great lengths the standard

560
00:23:46,848 --> 00:23:52,098
I'd they're jealous exactly clearly

561
00:23:50,538 --> 00:23:55,128
other people haven't bothered to do any

562
00:23:52,098 --> 00:23:56,838
of that well they're trying but I mean a

563
00:23:55,128 --> 00:23:58,519
lot of this stuff came from mom-and-pop

564
00:23:56,838 --> 00:24:01,219
operations that had to grow and expand

565
00:23:58,519 --> 00:24:02,749
quickly true but if you're shooting for

566
00:24:01,219 --> 00:24:05,778
a hundred and you're getting 15 either

567
00:24:02,749 --> 00:24:07,788
you're a [ __ ] or your math is seriously

568
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:09,919
flawed then I skip the paragraph where

569
00:24:07,788 --> 00:24:11,778
the owner of there if that company

570
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:13,489
argued saying that they had to be better

571
00:24:11,778 --> 00:24:14,778
I may have skipped a paragraph I

572
00:24:13,489 --> 00:24:17,149
apologize if I did I'm skimming through

573
00:24:14,778 --> 00:24:19,038
immediately making Storybrooke yeah oh

574
00:24:17,148 --> 00:24:20,388
do you want to keep reading shut up no

575
00:24:19,038 --> 00:24:22,519
keep going cuz you're gonna cover what I

576
00:24:20,388 --> 00:24:24,918
miss when this story broke the first day

577
00:24:22,519 --> 00:24:28,308
it was published on the Denver Post and

578
00:24:24,919 --> 00:24:31,369
in the cannabis the industry responded

579
00:24:28,308 --> 00:24:34,579
immediately with their lying or their

580
00:24:31,368 --> 00:24:36,499
testing methods were off or some other

581
00:24:34,579 --> 00:24:38,718
nonsense this quote he said I would be

582
00:24:36,499 --> 00:24:41,838
in shock if those tests were accurate

583
00:24:38,719 --> 00:24:43,909
said dr. J's CEO I'm not gonna butcher

584
00:24:41,838 --> 00:24:46,069
your last name doctor his name's Tom

585
00:24:43,909 --> 00:24:47,659
we're on top of the business in Colorado

586
00:24:46,069 --> 00:24:48,739
I wouldn't be in business this long if

587
00:24:47,659 --> 00:24:50,599
we weren't doing things right

588
00:24:48,739 --> 00:24:54,348
ninety-nine percent of the time

589
00:24:50,598 --> 00:24:55,398
I think 99 percent of people for the

590
00:24:54,348 --> 00:25:01,308
last year just didn't know what they

591
00:24:55,398 --> 00:25:03,048
were buying I'm speechless on your

592
00:25:01,308 --> 00:25:04,009
answer sorry I paused and nodded and

593
00:25:03,048 --> 00:25:06,500
nobody on a pond

594
00:25:04,009 --> 00:25:07,759
can see me POP if it was any other I

595
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:10,279
mean I go back to if it was any other

596
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:12,349
product if somebody told you that you

597
00:25:10,279 --> 00:25:13,849
know two out of four Ford's just burst

598
00:25:12,349 --> 00:25:15,679
into flames on the road

599
00:25:13,849 --> 00:25:17,029
would you ever even consider by what

600
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,140
again that's [ __ ] up I've been looking

601
00:25:17,029 --> 00:25:20,509
at a Ford sorry

602
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:22,400
Ford if that's not true for it I love

603
00:25:20,509 --> 00:25:26,930
you I've driven many Ford's for many

604
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:29,480
years thank you for like it's just silly

605
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:31,730
do you've if you can't produce a

606
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:34,279
standardized product you need to to

607
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:35,480
rethink what you're doing and and reset

608
00:25:34,279 --> 00:25:38,779
your kitchen now clearly they're failing

609
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:41,660
miserably and now anyone in Colorado can

610
00:25:38,779 --> 00:25:43,220
just walk into a testing facility inside

611
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:45,920
I think this chocolate bars Blanc I

612
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:48,170
saved two bites test it for me that's

613
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:50,960
strange I mean it's gonna cost him a few

614
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:55,220
bucks but if I got a hundred dollars I

615
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:57,350
think it you'll get more in a lawsuit

616
00:25:55,220 --> 00:26:00,769
saying I've tried to buy my medicine

617
00:25:57,349 --> 00:26:02,990
from dr. J and shafted me that's a good

618
00:26:00,769 --> 00:26:04,849
point well I bet you a lot of

619
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:06,589
dispensaries are gonna drop dr. J before

620
00:26:04,849 --> 00:26:08,629
too long and I was gonna say it I'd be

621
00:26:06,589 --> 00:26:10,220
surprised if that company is operating

622
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:13,220
under that management and under that

623
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:15,440
name in six months six months ladies and

624
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:18,230
gentlemen today is the day after st.

625
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:20,000
Patrick's Day March 18 March 18th so

626
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:20,960
this won't go out for a little while I'm

627
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,369
gonna try to put a couple episodes

628
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:25,039
together before I throw them out there

629
00:26:22,369 --> 00:26:27,049
get my [ __ ] together before I run so uh

630
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:28,220
Colorado medical or a marijuana is free

631
00:26:27,049 --> 00:26:29,659
later I'm getting back into the article

632
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:32,420
by the way Colorado marijuana industry

633
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:34,279
leader Dixie elixirs tested at 60

634
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:36,259
milligrams of THC with its Dixie rolls

635
00:26:34,279 --> 00:26:38,089
in the post study which are labeled at

636
00:26:36,259 --> 00:26:41,390
100 milligrams that's sixty percent of

637
00:26:38,089 --> 00:26:45,409
what you're paying for that's wrong it

638
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:48,620
is wrong so let's if I went to what's

639
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:49,850
worse if I want to what if you stopped

640
00:26:48,619 --> 00:26:51,139
at a fast-food restaurant under way here

641
00:26:49,849 --> 00:26:53,419
where would you have gone to get like a

642
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:55,009
drink or some sort of beverage I don't

643
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:57,259
do a lot of the fast food well I'm gonna

644
00:26:55,009 --> 00:26:58,549
see Taco Bell we're gonna say Burger

645
00:26:57,259 --> 00:26:59,809
Bell we're just gonna make up a spot

646
00:26:58,549 --> 00:27:01,879
called burger Bell if you stopped at

647
00:26:59,809 --> 00:27:04,220
[ __ ] burger Bell and you took off the

648
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:06,310
lid and your drink was only

649
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:11,509
three-quarters of 60% of the way full

650
00:27:06,309 --> 00:27:15,319
you'd go back can you spit in this and

651
00:27:11,509 --> 00:27:16,910
fill it the rest of the way up right now

652
00:27:15,319 --> 00:27:17,388
if it was any other industry none of

653
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:18,979
these things

654
00:27:17,388 --> 00:27:21,558
be acceptable at all none of these

655
00:27:18,979 --> 00:27:25,940
things would be acceptable not ever you

656
00:27:21,558 --> 00:27:29,088
got 60% of your dinner it are B's or 60%

657
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:30,440
of the gas I'm proud of somebody for

658
00:27:29,088 --> 00:27:32,298
stepping up and doing this thanks to the

659
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,690
Denver Post for doing it and the steep

660
00:27:32,298 --> 00:27:34,788
hill

661
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:37,038
so while continue while we were

662
00:27:34,788 --> 00:27:38,419
disappointed to learn that the learn of

663
00:27:37,038 --> 00:27:40,638
the post-test results we also know that

664
00:27:38,419 --> 00:27:43,009
a testing can vary significantly from

665
00:27:40,638 --> 00:27:44,748
one lab to the next disc C elixirs

666
00:27:43,009 --> 00:27:47,778
that's hard to say when you're dabbed

667
00:27:44,749 --> 00:27:50,298
out and reading quickly Dixie elixir CEO

668
00:27:47,778 --> 00:27:52,219
Joe Hoda said regardless we will

669
00:27:50,298 --> 00:27:54,288
continue to focus on our quality control

670
00:27:52,219 --> 00:27:56,509
to be sure all of our products from

671
00:27:54,288 --> 00:27:59,628
edibles tinctures and topicals reflect

672
00:27:56,509 --> 00:28:01,308
agreed upon milligrams of THC so from

673
00:27:59,628 --> 00:28:03,168
here on out they they're gonna do their

674
00:28:01,308 --> 00:28:03,888
best they say maybe they can regain

675
00:28:03,169 --> 00:28:05,719
their [ __ ]

676
00:28:03,888 --> 00:28:07,998
I see a lot of freebies somewhere from

677
00:28:05,719 --> 00:28:10,369
dr. J's you don't have to give a [ __ ]

678
00:28:07,999 --> 00:28:12,348
ton of stuff away man I'm really hoping

679
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:15,138
this shakes through the whole industry

680
00:28:12,348 --> 00:28:16,608
in Colorado from the edibles companies

681
00:28:15,138 --> 00:28:19,458
that have clearly been doing some shady

682
00:28:16,608 --> 00:28:22,728
business for the last several years down

683
00:28:19,459 --> 00:28:26,509
to the shops that have been saying

684
00:28:22,729 --> 00:28:28,700
they've got you know their Tora Bora

685
00:28:26,509 --> 00:28:31,459
tests it I don't know what ten percent

686
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:34,308
THC 10 percent CBD like they've been

687
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:36,078
able to claim whatever without the

688
00:28:34,308 --> 00:28:39,078
public having any real recourse to test

689
00:28:36,078 --> 00:28:41,088
that right and like if your beer says it

690
00:28:39,078 --> 00:28:42,798
was at three point three percent and it

691
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:45,888
could be at any percent like that causes

692
00:28:42,798 --> 00:28:48,138
real problems in society like having

693
00:28:45,888 --> 00:28:49,939
this radiance standard is a good thing

694
00:28:48,138 --> 00:28:51,258
it's part of the awesomeness that comes

695
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:55,269
with legalization none of this was

696
00:28:51,259 --> 00:28:57,139
possible five years ago you know yeah

697
00:28:55,269 --> 00:28:59,328
revolution boys a lot of knowledge

698
00:28:57,138 --> 00:29:01,638
that's coming out now is possible

699
00:28:59,328 --> 00:29:03,469
because of legalization right we can

700
00:29:01,638 --> 00:29:05,178
have these labs like Steve Howe that can

701
00:29:03,469 --> 00:29:08,058
test that for us and give us good

702
00:29:05,179 --> 00:29:09,499
results and standardized results I've

703
00:29:08,058 --> 00:29:11,229
seen a tour of their facility and it's

704
00:29:09,499 --> 00:29:13,129
impressive it's really awesome

705
00:29:11,229 --> 00:29:15,139
independent testing labs one of the

706
00:29:13,128 --> 00:29:17,598
first thing that sprang up alongside the

707
00:29:15,138 --> 00:29:19,728
legal weed industry in Colorado it was

708
00:29:17,598 --> 00:29:21,499
really cool to see that that became like

709
00:29:19,729 --> 00:29:23,419
a foundational component to it it's just

710
00:29:21,499 --> 00:29:25,759
sad that the edible companies have done

711
00:29:23,419 --> 00:29:26,800
such a bad job standardizing so far well

712
00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:28,720
they can't now

713
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:30,190
you know maybe now they know it my mic

714
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,870
sounds weird my headphones I apologize

715
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:35,640
if it sounds goofy to your ears we'll

716
00:29:31,869 --> 00:29:38,739
fix that fix it in post

717
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:40,840
alright I'll continue it says but if the

718
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:43,120
10 edibles tested in the exclusive Post

719
00:29:40,839 --> 00:29:45,609
report no edible had the THC level

720
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:47,709
problems of dr. J's Evan said you're

721
00:29:45,609 --> 00:29:49,809
taking less than a milligram of THC and

722
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:52,120
our product that says 100 Evan said if

723
00:29:49,809 --> 00:29:53,799
people have no confidence in the

724
00:29:52,119 --> 00:29:55,629
industry then there could be a sort of

725
00:29:53,799 --> 00:29:58,960
backlash against the whole legal

726
00:29:55,630 --> 00:30:00,400
marijuana movement yep so I'm gonna

727
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,990
finish the articles one paragraph since

728
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:04,509
how can these numbers be so disparate

729
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:05,740
while there's been much discussion over

730
00:30:04,509 --> 00:30:08,170
testing guidelines it's still a

731
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:10,059
voluntary action for growers and makers

732
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:11,970
of marijuana infused products or mi pees

733
00:30:10,059 --> 00:30:14,379
so again I just want to give credit to

734
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:17,079
who's the homie that wrote it Ricardo

735
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:21,640
Baca from the Denver Post now what they

736
00:30:17,079 --> 00:30:23,289
tested was bang fire chocolate bar I've

737
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:26,170
had that that's a tastiness right there

738
00:30:23,289 --> 00:30:28,240
it listed 180 milligrams it actually had

739
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:32,950
a hundred and fifty six milligrams not

740
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:34,390
too bad it's a lot closer yet I'm gonna

741
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:36,400
give that one a 6 I'll give that one a

742
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:38,200
thumbs up that's cool that's you missed

743
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:40,030
it by a little bit but I mean compared

744
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,390
to the competition what the hell can I

745
00:30:40,029 --> 00:30:42,389
say

746
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:45,580
so dr. J's bars the milk chocolate

747
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:48,700
listed 100 milligrams guess how many bro

748
00:30:45,579 --> 00:30:53,199
point four point four that's ridiculous

749
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:55,299
redonkulous if that's acceptable yeah so

750
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:59,200
what if you bought that what dude people

751
00:30:55,299 --> 00:31:01,359
are relying okay right dr. J star bars

752
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:03,490
winter mint chocolate 0.3 they claim to

753
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:05,259
have a hundred dr. J star bars white

754
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:09,039
chocolate claim to have a hundred look

755
00:31:05,259 --> 00:31:11,950
they stepped it up they got five out of

756
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:13,899
a hundred five percent like a five

757
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:15,309
milligram that's there dr. J's highest

758
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:17,800
test score was five per se that's why I

759
00:31:15,309 --> 00:31:19,960
was excited for five milligrams and five

760
00:31:17,799 --> 00:31:22,119
mil it's 5% cos it's 100 so it's that

761
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:24,190
was that's accurate for that one dr. J's

762
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:27,879
jellystone's they list a hundred they

763
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:29,950
got point two point two dude if you owed

764
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:31,090
me a hundred dollars and I showed up was

765
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:32,200
that twenty cents if I showed up with

766
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:33,750
twenty cents and threw it on the table

767
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:36,130
would you punch me in the damn mouth

768
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:38,920
well maybe not for the mouth for twenty

769
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:43,330
of a point well-taken like this is like

770
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:44,860
it's it it's irresponsible business

771
00:31:43,329 --> 00:31:46,689
prayer if any other industry did this

772
00:31:44,859 --> 00:31:48,699
they would not if your new car showed up

773
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:51,880
with no seats no tires no engine no

774
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:55,420
brakes no brakes like come on I'm a

775
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:57,130
caregiver I'm in this I fell in love I

776
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:58,390
worked at it I was a grower I was in

777
00:31:57,130 --> 00:32:01,300

for years before I should admit it I

779
00:32:01,299 --> 00:32:05,589
fell in love with cannabis years ago I

780
00:32:03,009 --> 00:32:07,569
became an employee manager I ran a

781
00:32:05,589 --> 00:32:10,119
dispensary I fell in love with watching

782
00:32:07,569 --> 00:32:11,500
people fall in love with cannabis and

783
00:32:10,119 --> 00:32:14,319
watch it improve their lives I'm a

784
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:15,789
caregiver I am involved in cannabis I

785
00:32:14,319 --> 00:32:17,349

788
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:24,789
[ __ ] up conditions that I see I see it

789
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:27,339
I'm their friends and I watch them get

790
00:32:24,789 --> 00:32:29,829
better consuming the medicine that I

791
00:32:27,339 --> 00:32:31,929
produced that's when I'm in it for when

792
00:32:29,829 --> 00:32:34,389
you're producing an edible that's listed

793
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:37,450
to have a hundred milligrams and only

794
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:39,880
has five you're taking money from a sick

795
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:41,259
[ __ ] person first of all a person

796
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:43,210
that no matter who you are you work hard

797
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:46,359
for your money no matter what you do now

798
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:49,809
you work hard for your money well most

799
00:32:46,359 --> 00:32:51,429
of us work hard for our than others yes

800
00:32:49,809 --> 00:32:53,039
but some of us have mommy and daddy's

801
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:55,210
money but that's a whole other podcast

802
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:57,039
you're ripping people off you're taking

803
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:58,870
money out of hard-working people that

804
00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:01,869
trusted you to take care of them and now

805
00:32:58,869 --> 00:33:03,729
they aren't medicated what about people

806
00:33:01,869 --> 00:33:06,039
like brave mykayla what about people

807
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:07,990
that needed medicine what about people

808
00:33:06,039 --> 00:33:09,430
like cash hide that rely on that sort of

809
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:10,660
thing and sorry to bring up people that

810
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:12,370
have passed and people that are sick but

811
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:14,340
those people needed medicine and if you

812
00:33:12,369 --> 00:33:17,769
give them okay this will help you don't

813
00:33:14,339 --> 00:33:18,879
rely on you exactly what was it girls

814
00:33:17,769 --> 00:33:21,039
name from Utah that was doing the

815
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:23,350
Charlotte's Web sorry to disrespect but

816
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:24,849
that's people a good example if we gave

817
00:33:23,349 --> 00:33:27,579
them medicine that was not what we

818
00:33:24,849 --> 00:33:28,959
promised to give them they're not gonna

819
00:33:27,579 --> 00:33:30,639
get it medicated and they're gonna get

820
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,799
sick again they'll go into remission and

821
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:34,660
we just ripped them off and gave them

822
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:37,089
cancer all over again and that was

823
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:38,680
[ __ ] up in my mind you that's not love

824
00:33:37,089 --> 00:33:41,439
that's not compassion that's dollar

825
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:42,940
signs dr. J's on to give you guys the

826
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,080
opportunity to redeem yourselves I can't

827
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:45,610
pass you a hundred percent I'm not a

828
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:47,529
scientist I don't work for your company

829
00:33:45,609 --> 00:33:49,799
I want you guys to get it back together

830
00:33:47,529 --> 00:33:53,129
like to see you come through

831
00:33:49,799 --> 00:33:55,200
and redeem yourselves please well you

832
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:56,760
know the Denver Post isn't done with

833
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,750
this in six months they're gonna do the

834
00:33:56,759 --> 00:33:59,730
same thing they're gonna send the

835
00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:02,549
reporters to 15 or 20 shops they're

836
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:03,839
gonna buy up less election edibles from

837
00:34:02,549 --> 00:34:05,009
different shops they're gonna take them

838
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:07,470
back to steep hill and one of the other

839
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:09,780
testing labs and this reports coming out

840
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:12,329
again every couple of months I hope so

841
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:14,010
until it comes back with 80 or 90% of

842
00:34:12,329 --> 00:34:16,319
the products tested or scoring right

843
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:17,909
where they should I mean there's no

844
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:23,039
reason that I mean edibles have always

845
00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:25,590
been hit or miss but when you're working

846
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:27,750
in a kitchen trying to make can of

847
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:29,280
butter or can of oil and then make them

848
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:31,648
into an edible product for you and a

849
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:35,120
couple of friends the process is

850
00:34:31,648 --> 00:34:39,059
different and being unevenly dispersed

851
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:40,799
throughout the batch is less important

852
00:34:39,059 --> 00:34:42,360
and that sort of always been true with

853
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,610
edibles you're gonna make make a tray of

854
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:46,710
brownies one brownie will wreck you for

855
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:48,690
30 hours another brownie won't do

856
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:50,970
anything but when you're selling it as a

857
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:54,000
medicine and as a standardized product

858
00:34:50,969 --> 00:34:55,829
in the store it can't waiver your your

859
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:59,329
10 milligrams should always be a 10 your

860
00:34:55,829 --> 00:34:59,329
hundred should always be an absolute

861
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:11,820
about this conversation so comfortable

862
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:13,590
though like Jeff and I had had a

863
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:14,940
conversation right after he came back

864
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:18,450
from meeting the guys at steep hill

865
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:20,010
about how your terpene molecules and

866
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:22,109
things like that can be dispersed

867
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:24,270
differently throughout your like slab of

868
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:26,160
hash that's why I depending on what part

869
00:35:24,269 --> 00:35:29,300
of the slab of hash you get done

870
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:32,909
watching this sample so there you go I

871
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:35,130
think that could also be true with the

872
00:35:32,909 --> 00:35:37,259
canna butters and the kind of oils and

873
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:40,260
it all gets dispersed differently so

874
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:43,250
when you make it it would it's it's it

875
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:46,830
is very difficult to to get that

876
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:48,929
completely spread across the board

877
00:35:46,829 --> 00:35:52,349
Jeff's brought me Kevin's brought me

878
00:35:48,929 --> 00:35:54,000
slabs a hash that and sometimes I get

879
00:35:52,349 --> 00:35:55,949
you know 10 to 30 grams from him

880
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,960
sometimes when he does it he's making

881
00:35:55,949 --> 00:35:59,789
the shape of a pie plate or a frisbee

882
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:01,050
with my hands so those of you who can't

883
00:35:59,789 --> 00:36:03,320
see through the radio now I was trying

884
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:07,830
to measure how many grams that

885
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:10,470
so and sometimes I we can see the

886
00:36:07,829 --> 00:36:13,349
puddles of different I don't know if

887
00:36:10,469 --> 00:36:15,389
it's terpenoids or flavonoids or there's

888
00:36:13,349 --> 00:36:17,940
another one that the name just left my

889
00:36:15,389 --> 00:36:20,849
head right now Paley it's I think is

890
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:22,590
what they may be and I can't identify

891
00:36:20,849 --> 00:36:23,849
them by the puddles but you could see

892
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:25,380
that there's any of you dad from

893
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:27,029
different sections they taste different

894
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:28,140
you can see the different layers of

895
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:29,820
stuff yeah like you're different

896
00:36:28,139 --> 00:36:31,259
different layers of the pie and it's

897
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:34,200
different oils separating at different

898
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:36,210
textures so that's a good defense for

899
00:36:34,199 --> 00:36:38,669
these edibles and I agree with you there

900
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:40,800
maybe maybe they cooked them

901
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:42,269
tipped up this way the horizontally no

902
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,820
that's vertically maybe they cook them

903
00:36:42,269 --> 00:36:46,110
vertically and all the goodies ran down

904
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:49,289
to the bottom bite and they tested the

905
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:52,200
top bite but those edibles are not a

906
00:36:49,289 --> 00:36:55,860
hundred 100 milligrams is too much of a

907
00:36:52,199 --> 00:36:57,389
dose for the recent person I've been

908
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:59,849
treating that's too much for him he

909
00:36:57,389 --> 00:37:01,799
needs half of that so if he it's hat he

910
00:36:59,849 --> 00:37:03,089
expects to get half of it when he splits

911
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:05,039
it in half he doesn't think I'm gonna

912
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:07,190
get [ __ ] roller-coaster the first

913
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:10,110
time and just be bored the second time

914
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:12,300
if the fact we're talking about is

915
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:14,400
what's causing dr. J's test results that

916
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:17,070
means that there are dr. J's edibles out

917
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:19,860
there with several hundred milligrams of

918
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:22,080
THC per dose rather than the single

919
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:26,730
hundred they're advertising which is

920
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:28,739
just as and I don't think that's the

921
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:30,269
case with dr. J's it is probably the

922
00:37:28,739 --> 00:37:43,589
case with some of the others that were

923
00:37:30,269 --> 00:37:45,750
testing white chocolate star bars and

924
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:47,370
winter mint chocolate maybe that shit's

925
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:49,170
stirring up and it's getting a little

926
00:37:47,369 --> 00:37:50,429
puddle on one side or maybe it's stuck

927
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:52,349
to the wrapper we got to give them a

928
00:37:50,429 --> 00:37:54,419
little bit of those yeah maybe these

929
00:37:52,349 --> 00:37:56,759
idiots are cooking it off in their ovens

930
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:58,710
a little too hot or something cooking it

931
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:00,660
at 400 degrees for 30 minutes that's a

932
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:02,639
good I'm just saying they had a rogue

933
00:38:00,659 --> 00:38:05,309
employee rip them off if they're doing

934
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:07,019
dr. J's company like the good folks

935
00:38:05,309 --> 00:38:08,369
there have no idea maybe there's one it

936
00:38:07,019 --> 00:38:11,039
takes one bad apple and your whole

937
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:13,319
company to [ __ ] produce a whole seven

938
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:15,460
units seven thousand units of [ __ ] up

939
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:18,700
chocolate bars knowing this

940
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:19,809
of Dixie elixir and Sheba choose in some

941
00:38:18,699 --> 00:38:23,308
of those other major companies

942
00:38:19,809 --> 00:38:27,400
operations I can see how their numbers

943
00:38:23,309 --> 00:38:29,190
kinda went all over the place these last

944
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:31,630
couple of months because their

945
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:34,750
distribution quadruple I mean they're

946
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:36,880
they weren't prepared for the demand

947
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:39,190
that set their companies even a little

948
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:41,619
bit it's hard to predict [ __ ] blew up

949
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:44,260
here yet no one knew what was coming at

950
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:45,490
what the demand would be like and on top

951
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:47,349
of that none of these people were

952
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:49,269
allowed to produce product for the new

953
00:38:47,349 --> 00:38:51,640
recreational market they had to transfer

954
00:38:49,269 --> 00:38:53,318
over up to fifteen percent of their

955
00:38:51,639 --> 00:38:56,289
existing inventory and this caused all

956
00:38:53,318 --> 00:38:59,529
sorts of product interruptions and

957
00:38:56,289 --> 00:39:01,329
shortages and in an effort to scramble

958
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:03,550
to catch up how much of these test

959
00:39:01,329 --> 00:39:06,550
results are due to that just trying to

960
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:09,099
rush it it's a good point just trying to

961
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:10,150
rush it nobody we saw it coming but we

962
00:39:09,099 --> 00:39:10,660
didn't know it was gonna happen like

963
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:12,789
this

964
00:39:10,659 --> 00:39:15,308
and when a rack hit it was so hyped up

965
00:39:12,789 --> 00:39:17,588
and everybody got anxious and [ __ ] like

966
00:39:15,309 --> 00:39:20,140
we got pumped up I want to say another

967
00:39:17,588 --> 00:39:22,269
thing I don't wanna scare everybody away

968
00:39:20,139 --> 00:39:25,539
don't be afraid of dispensaries and

969
00:39:22,269 --> 00:39:28,329
edibles this is one company out of I'm

970
00:39:25,539 --> 00:39:31,420
gonna read off more brands at a pure

971
00:39:28,329 --> 00:39:33,818
lemon drops hard candies listed a

972
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:36,430
hundred percent they tested it 45 mile

973
00:39:33,818 --> 00:39:40,058
high candies watermelon drops listed 100

to know a company that I've supported

990
00:40:09,489 --> 00:40:14,439
vocally good score you should do I mean

991
00:40:13,088 --> 00:40:15,818
I'm not being a smartass to your answer

992
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:17,619
you should do the math you because the

993
00:40:15,818 --> 00:40:19,150
number the recommended dose is smaller

994
00:40:17,619 --> 00:40:20,318

1015
00:41:08,469 --> 00:41:13,479
a professional bro they both had to be

1016
00:41:10,059 --> 00:41:15,489
overdosed cuz I was so here's Mike's

1017
00:41:13,478 --> 00:41:20,318
favorite Chi but you quat dough soft

1018
00:41:15,489 --> 00:41:22,179
candies which is usually my go-to edible

1019
00:41:20,318 --> 00:41:24,308
if I gotta go somewhere to eat inedible

1020
00:41:22,179 --> 00:41:27,578
they say they have 70 milligrams they

1021
00:41:24,309 --> 00:41:28,930
came in at 53 right I am that's not

1022
00:41:27,579 --> 00:41:30,278
nearly as bad as some of the other

1023
00:41:28,929 --> 00:41:32,108
companies on there but still there

1024
00:41:30,278 --> 00:41:37,929
what's the percentage did you do it I

1025
00:41:32,108 --> 00:41:46,328
didn't do it Oh 70 53 divided by 70

1026
00:41:37,929 --> 00:41:48,848
right that's right it's still a shortage

1027
00:41:46,329 --> 00:41:54,339
of I mean if you're paying for seven do

1028
00:41:48,849 --> 00:41:55,690
you expect I did they came in better

1029
00:41:54,338 --> 00:41:57,068
than a lot of the companies in my

1030
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:58,900
experience with them is it's a

1031
00:41:57,068 --> 00:42:00,998
consistent product it's a good product

1032
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:03,009
like the flavors decent I love their red

1033
00:42:00,998 --> 00:42:07,389
Hornet candies or the Green Hornet candy

1034

about hash and when we talk about hash

1141
00:47:06,568 --> 00:47:09,969
my favorite topic sometimes you sound

1142
00:47:09,039 --> 00:47:13,298
like you're full of [ __ ] but when

1143
00:47:09,969 --> 00:47:15,279
attached to you I believe I try to keep

1144
00:47:13,298 --> 00:47:17,108
up on my hash knowledge and most of my

1145
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:18,760
cannabis knowledge you do well in our

1146

00:47:25,269 --> 00:47:28,960
gathered here today we I wanted to talk

1151
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:31,960

1152
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:33,400
this past weekend in California should

1153
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:36,699
tell you guys about the secret cup the

1154
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:38,980
secret cup is a pretty exclusive hash

1155
00:47:36,699 --> 00:47:40,989
competition the competition part is

1156
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:43,929
invite only you have to be invited by

1157
00:47:40,989 --> 00:47:46,328
Big D shout out to Big D for hosting a

1158
00:47:43,929 --> 00:47:49,419
super sweet exclusive hash event

1159
00:47:46,329 --> 00:47:51,019
definitely we've competed Kevin and I

1160
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:53,389
have competed together I grew across

1161
00:47:51,019 --> 00:47:55,070
and Kevin extracted it and made pretty

1162
00:47:53,389 --> 00:47:56,509
tasty dads out of it I was satisfied

1163
00:47:55,070 --> 00:47:57,320
with our results as a first-time

1164
00:47:56,510 --> 00:47:59,720
competitor

1165
00:47:57,320 --> 00:48:01,910
yeah me too especially just a year into

1166
00:47:59,719 --> 00:48:04,489
it so that was really nice to see where

1167
00:48:01,909 --> 00:48:07,699
I fit in and we did well we we placed

1168
00:48:04,489 --> 00:48:16,549
respectfully doubly respectfully top ten

1169
00:48:07,699 --> 00:48:20,329
finish it was both yeah yeah once and

1170
00:48:16,550 --> 00:48:22,940
again we'll do it so the secret cup is

1171
00:48:20,329 --> 00:48:24,590
the competition part is invite only if

1172
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:26,179
you want to go hang out you kind of just

1173
00:48:24,590 --> 00:48:27,559
gotta know how to get tickets they don't

1174
00:48:26,179 --> 00:48:29,599
really advertise a lot you got to know

1175
00:48:27,559 --> 00:48:31,670
who to know if you're in the loop you'll

1176
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:34,099
end up at the secret cup yeah definitely

1177
00:48:31,670 --> 00:48:37,309
it's so the way they do it every

1178
00:48:34,099 --> 00:48:38,659
competitor brings his hash to the entry

1179
00:48:37,309 --> 00:48:41,719
table and they divide it into small

1180
00:48:38,659 --> 00:48:44,000
samples and every competitor gets to

1181
00:48:41,719 --> 00:48:45,829
actually be a judge so they all take

1182
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,909
dabs of all the stuff that's out there

1183
00:48:45,829 --> 00:48:48,529
so I find it to be a pretty fair

1184
00:48:46,909 --> 00:48:52,879
competition because it's judged by the

1185
00:48:48,530 --> 00:48:55,850
competitors which keeps it fair that I

1186
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:57,320
just repeated myself and I mean it's who

1187
00:48:55,849 --> 00:48:59,569
better to judge some hash than a bunch

1188
00:48:57,320 --> 00:49:01,670
of hash makers and hash connoisseurs you

1189
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:02,960
judge it against your peers are you

1190
00:49:01,670 --> 00:49:06,579
gonna join again that are we gonna

1191
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:06,579
participate again this year bro I'm game

1192
00:49:08,809 --> 00:49:12,949
I'll be entering big deal if you hear

1193
00:49:11,059 --> 00:49:14,389
this I read genetics and elevated

1194
00:49:12,949 --> 00:49:16,250
concentrations want to come participate

1195
00:49:14,389 --> 00:49:18,379
in the secret Cup again once again it

1196
00:49:16,250 --> 00:49:20,030
was a great time last year so much fun

1197
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:22,220
with all the competitors and everything

1198
00:49:20,030 --> 00:49:24,560
and they're all such great people and

1199
00:49:22,219 --> 00:49:28,129
it's just fun to put our stuff together

1200
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:30,710
and try everybody's dabs this whole dad

1201
00:49:28,130 --> 00:49:33,200
community is amazing from we've got

1202
00:49:30,710 --> 00:49:34,880
musicians they entertain us while we're

1203
00:49:33,199 --> 00:49:36,919
dabbing we've got people that come and

1204
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:38,180
bring medicated and non-medicated food

1205
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:39,769
that are part of the scene I don't just

1206
00:49:38,179 --> 00:49:41,419
see them I don't see them at any other

1207
00:49:39,769 --> 00:49:43,190
events other than cannabis related but I

1208
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:45,470
see them at every cannabis related event

1209
00:49:43,190 --> 00:49:47,900
vending food we got people that make

1210
00:49:45,469 --> 00:49:49,219
pipes for us that are in our groups like

1211
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:51,050
in our industry we got people that are

1212
00:49:49,219 --> 00:49:52,609
making our extracts we got clothing we

1213
00:49:51,050 --> 00:49:54,490
got pin companies we're all friends now

1214
00:49:52,610 --> 00:49:57,980
yeah it's kind of a neat little

1215
00:49:54,489 --> 00:50:00,049
community industry I guess that's what

1216
00:49:57,980 --> 00:50:01,909
you call it it's a family bro if you're

1217
00:50:00,050 --> 00:50:03,910
honest and real and not a dick you're

1218
00:50:01,909 --> 00:50:06,788
pretty much accepted and

1219
00:50:03,909 --> 00:50:08,078
and well and even if you are a dick

1220
00:50:06,789 --> 00:50:10,210
we'll let you into the crew because

1221
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:12,670
every crew needs a couple of dicks yeah

1222
00:50:10,210 --> 00:50:14,048
that sounds really gross their dicks out

1223
00:50:12,670 --> 00:50:15,700
there but they know what they're talking

1224
00:50:14,048 --> 00:50:18,250
about when it comes down to serious [ __ ]

1225
00:50:15,699 --> 00:50:19,088
so so you have to respect him this is a

1226
00:50:18,250 --> 00:50:21,309
weird segue

1227
00:50:19,088 --> 00:50:24,489
speaking of deities a lot of people are

1228
00:50:21,309 --> 00:50:27,369
frustrated and hating on steep hill

1229
00:50:24,489 --> 00:50:30,159
halen labs but I find what they did to

1230
00:50:27,369 --> 00:50:31,710
be I think it was legit every sample

1231
00:50:30,159 --> 00:50:35,108
that runs through the secret cup is

1232
00:50:31,710 --> 00:50:38,619
tested through a lab and they used steep

1233
00:50:35,108 --> 00:50:40,568
hill Halen labs which is I know the

1234

those guys are cool guys from the Cpl

1241
00:50:53,409 --> 00:50:57,670
Halen they tested every sample that went

1242
00:50:54,969 --> 00:50:59,980
through there and they found some pretty

1243
00:50:57,670 --> 00:51:01,960
interesting results almost every single

1244
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:05,639
sample that was entered into the secret

1245
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:07,509
Cup was it would not have passed

1246
00:51:05,639 --> 00:51:09,429
California Standards or Colorado

1247
00:51:07,509 --> 00:51:13,869
standards for what they call clean and

1248
00:51:09,429 --> 00:51:15,969
safe BHO it all contained a chemical

1249
00:51:13,869 --> 00:51:18,420
called pentane it's actually a gas

1250
00:51:15,969 --> 00:51:21,548
called pentane which is part of butane

1251

00:53:15,210 --> 00:53:20,909
my topic was the secret Cup was happened

1292
00:53:18,150 --> 00:53:23,190
last weekend and steep hill hail had the

1293
00:53:20,909 --> 00:53:25,739
honor of testing every sample that was

1294
00:53:23,190 --> 00:53:28,139
entered into the cup and from what I've

1295
00:53:25,739 --> 00:53:30,299
read you guys have discovered pentane or

1296
00:53:28,139 --> 00:53:33,389
other contaminants and nearly every

1297
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:35,010
sample that was entered I'm hoping that

1298
00:53:33,389 --> 00:53:39,349
maybe you can educate myself and my

1299
00:53:35,010 --> 00:53:39,350
listeners about what you guys do and

my first phone interview ever I was with

1373
01:10:06,159 --> 01:10:11,409
mr. Addison tomorrow from steep hill got

1374
01:10:08,529 --> 01:10:13,119
a lot of education to give us there feel

1375
01:10:11,409 --> 01:10:15,250
like I just got a hash education for

1376
01:10:13,119 --> 01:10:18,130
free yeah that was pretty cool actually

1377
01:10:15,250 --> 01:10:21,670
it was neat to hear some of the things

1378
01:10:18,130 --> 01:10:23,680
he said especially towards the end about

1379
01:10:21,670 --> 01:10:25,720
a lot of the specifics on the testing

1380
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:27,909
that they're doing because I didn't

1381
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:32,440
really know much about that end of it a

1382
01:10:27,909 --> 01:10:34,899
lot of the beginning stuff I was I was

1383
01:10:32,439 --> 01:10:36,399
pretty much privy to I guess you could

1384
01:10:34,899 --> 01:10:39,009
say and just kind of holding it in

1385
01:10:36,399 --> 01:10:40,689
myself so it's neat to kind of have some

1386
01:10:39,010 --> 01:10:43,960
of the things I've been thinking about

1387
01:10:40,689 --> 01:10:45,579
and some of my concerns also validated

1388
01:10:43,960 --> 01:10:48,159
through somebody who's so respected in

1389
01:10:45,579 --> 01:10:49,779
the industry me being you know beginner

1390
01:10:48,159 --> 01:10:51,460
doesn't that always feel good yeah it's

1391
01:10:49,779 --> 01:10:53,079
it's neat like it's it's just different

1392
01:10:51,460 --> 01:10:55,449

old Ripper I'm not sure how he spells it

1398
01:11:02,920 --> 01:11:06,158
we'll find

1399
01:11:03,429 --> 01:11:07,239
before the end of the show that he's got

1400
01:11:06,158 --> 01:11:08,920
some cool pictures

1401
01:11:07,238 --> 01:11:10,178
get your stuff tested by steep hill I

1402
01:11:08,920 --> 01:11:11,529
always trust everything that they tell

1403
01:11:10,179 --> 01:11:12,940
me they've got a good clean lab I've

1404
01:11:11,529 --> 01:11:14,710
been there I don't they don't pay me to

1405
01:11:12,939 --> 01:11:17,319
say that I like it that's the only

1406
01:11:14,710 --> 01:11:19,840
reason I talk about him and also to the

1407
01:11:17,319 --> 01:11:25,179
secret I where did I come from a bad

1408
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:27,880
southern thing that's a great couple you

1409
01:11:25,179 --> 01:11:30,730
guys were listening to all the secret

1410
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:32,440
cup competitors whose concentrates were

1411
01:11:30,729 --> 01:11:33,369
tested were not uh we're not calling you

1412
01:11:32,439 --> 01:11:35,259
out we're not trying to dis you or

1413
01:11:33,369 --> 01:11:36,609
anything we just this was the example

1414
01:11:35,260 --> 01:11:39,640
that we had this is where the results

1415
01:11:36,609 --> 01:11:41,979
came from I know that you guys will get

1416
01:11:39,640 --> 01:11:44,170
together and fix your tech and you guys

1417
01:11:41,979 --> 01:11:45,609
will figure out how to do this yeah and

1418
01:11:44,170 --> 01:11:48,190
we'll see where everyone else is that

1419
01:11:45,609 --> 01:11:50,619
too because like like a DS Addison said

1420
01:11:48,189 --> 01:11:53,889
it's that's the first time they've done

1421
01:11:50,619 --> 01:11:56,019
that test for the secret cup so it'll

1422
01:11:53,890 --> 01:11:59,230
kind of we'll see when we go to the

1423
01:11:56,020 --> 01:12:02,409
other regions what what the rest of our

1424
01:11:59,229 --> 01:12:05,198
hash tests at and if it's similar or if

1425
01:12:02,408 --> 01:12:07,869
it's you know some more way different or

1426
01:12:05,198 --> 01:12:10,809
who does what you know he did also

1427
01:12:07,869 --> 01:12:13,090
mention that they'll even the butane is

1428
01:12:10,810 --> 01:12:15,219
the highest concentrate concentration

1429
01:12:13,090 --> 01:12:16,960
high most highly concentrated them that

1430
01:12:15,219 --> 01:12:18,789
was hard to find butane is the most

1431
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:20,408
highly concentrated residual solvent

1432
01:12:18,789 --> 01:12:22,420
left in dads at their finding and he

1433
01:12:20,408 --> 01:12:24,789
said that that is not even at a

1434
01:12:22,420 --> 01:12:26,649
dangerous level if you consider other

1435
01:12:24,789 --> 01:12:28,779
applications that we're using butane for

1436
01:12:26,649 --> 01:12:30,789
so we don't need to quit dabbing just

1437
01:12:28,779 --> 01:12:32,859
because of a little pentane scare this

1438
01:12:30,789 --> 01:12:34,479
is just the new thing we figured out

1439
01:12:32,859 --> 01:12:37,059
Mystery Oil we've learned how to get rid

1440
01:12:34,479 --> 01:12:38,859
of Mystery Oil we're we're a smart bunch

1441
01:12:37,060 --> 01:12:40,330
we're gonna learn us together yeah the

1442
01:12:38,859 --> 01:12:42,158
more we work with it and the more we

1443
01:12:40,329 --> 01:12:44,019
develop and the more we learn about it

1444
01:12:42,158 --> 01:12:46,029
the better we can make everything and we

1445
01:12:44,020 --> 01:12:48,159
can make things you know just like we've

1446
01:12:46,029 --> 01:12:50,529
already keeps we already keep stepping

1447
01:12:48,158 --> 01:12:52,559
it up as a community keep making things

1448
01:12:50,529 --> 01:12:55,869
better and better and easier and more

1449
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:58,539
safe and all that so you know that's

1450
01:12:55,869 --> 01:13:01,380
that's what it takes takes a community

1451
01:12:58,539 --> 01:13:03,670
and we all pitch in a little bit and

1452
01:13:01,380 --> 01:13:05,230
every time you bring me back about your

1453
01:13:03,670 --> 01:13:09,279
hash it's a little bit better every

1454
01:13:05,229 --> 01:13:11,559
single thank you I learned from every

1455
01:13:09,279 --> 01:13:14,050
batch ash I learned something from every

1456
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:15,610
single batch if you pay attention to it

1457
01:13:14,050 --> 01:13:17,289
you will I mean it's just a natural

1458
01:13:15,609 --> 01:13:18,670
hollow sherry

1459
01:13:17,289 --> 01:13:19,779
a website with you I got a scroll down

1460
01:13:18,670 --> 01:13:22,029
to find it but once I get to this

1461
01:13:19,779 --> 01:13:24,579
website it's where a few of our highly

1462
01:13:22,029 --> 01:13:26,139
respected hash community members it's

1463
01:13:24,579 --> 01:13:27,670
where they find and share their

1464
01:13:26,140 --> 01:13:29,230
information so it'll be useful to

1465
01:13:27,670 --> 01:13:31,690
everybody get a pen to write that down

1466
01:13:29,229 --> 01:13:34,179
I gotta also remember to give you the

1467
01:13:31,689 --> 01:13:36,069
correct at Earl Ripper Instagram just

1468
01:13:34,180 --> 01:13:38,860
scroll through Instagram and look for at

1469
01:13:36,069 --> 01:13:40,420
er RL Ripper it's close to that you'll

1470
01:13:38,859 --> 01:13:42,579
find him there's pictures of this dude

1471
01:13:40,420 --> 01:13:44,260
named Madison he looks like that uh that

1472
01:13:42,579 --> 01:13:46,029
Mexican drug cartel that just got busted

1473
01:13:44,260 --> 01:13:49,030
I thought that was really funny yeah

1474
01:13:46,029 --> 01:13:51,039
kind of does look like that guy so one

1475
01:13:49,029 --> 01:13:52,420
cool thing that I heard in there that

1476
01:13:51,039 --> 01:13:55,210
caught my attention they don't reveal

1477
01:13:52,420 --> 01:13:56,710
this solvents they're testing for well

1478
01:13:55,210 --> 01:14:01,119
yeah kind of neat I thought that was

1479
01:13:56,710 --> 01:14:06,180
interesting kinda like that I think it's

1480
01:14:01,119 --> 01:14:08,319
I think it's much less biased and I

1481
01:14:06,180 --> 01:14:10,210
think it just makes it really fair for

1482
01:14:08,319 --> 01:14:12,130
everyone you know just try to make the

1483
01:14:10,210 --> 01:14:13,899
best hash you can make and we'll test it

1484
01:14:12,130 --> 01:14:15,699
and find out there you go you know and

1485
01:14:13,899 --> 01:14:17,710
then we'll share information to let you

1486
01:14:15,699 --> 01:14:19,329
know what's going on after we're done

1487
01:14:17,710 --> 01:14:21,909
testing and that's kind of nice you know

1488
01:14:19,329 --> 01:14:23,859
yeah well that's and now we know to get

1489
01:14:21,909 --> 01:14:25,659
rid of that to that kind of exactly so

1490
01:14:23,859 --> 01:14:27,069
what we learned the one I give you a big

1491
01:14:25,659 --> 01:14:30,840
thumbs down in the middle of that while

1492
01:14:27,069 --> 01:14:33,969
he was talking Terps terpenes terpenoids

1493
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:34,810
their terpenoids if you don't know the

1494
01:14:33,970 --> 01:14:36,520
whole word you got to read the

1495
01:14:34,810 --> 01:14:40,000
definition of terpenoids and read what

1496
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:45,550
those are once you know what terpenoids

1497
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:49,539
are than you can say terms also if you

1498
01:14:45,550 --> 01:14:52,810
say try chromes or trichomes it's TR IC

1499
01:14:49,539 --> 01:14:53,380
H ome yes it's a trichome there's no

1500
01:14:52,810 --> 01:14:55,870
Chrome

1501
01:14:53,380 --> 01:14:57,940
we're not polishing it I just want to

1502
01:14:55,869 --> 01:14:59,109
help you people be educated I'm not

1503
01:14:57,939 --> 01:15:01,750
trying to be an [ __ ] even though I

1504
01:14:59,109 --> 01:15:03,339
feel like one sudden these terpenoids

1505
01:15:01,750 --> 01:15:06,039
I'm speaking of boil at the same

1506
01:15:03,340 --> 01:15:07,420
temperatures as pentane so when you're

1507
01:15:06,039 --> 01:15:09,519
trying to purge off your pentane

1508
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:12,190
you're [ __ ] destroying Detroit's and

1509
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:13,780
the Terps are but the second one of my

1510
01:15:12,189 --> 01:15:15,609
favorite second favorite part of the

1511
01:15:13,779 --> 01:15:17,469
hash for me and that was an interesting

1512
01:15:15,609 --> 01:15:19,750
part for me because when he started

1513
01:15:17,470 --> 01:15:22,180
mentioning you know using the closed

1514
01:15:19,750 --> 01:15:24,369
loop and the cold trap and how it's

1515
01:15:22,180 --> 01:15:27,250
getting us to these you know safe levels

1516
01:15:24,369 --> 01:15:29,659
and things we can do to further advance

1517
01:15:27,250 --> 01:15:31,369
our concentrates I've been

1518
01:15:29,659 --> 01:15:32,960
it's something I've been talking about

1519
01:15:31,369 --> 01:15:35,359
with a close group of friends of mine

1520
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:37,430
that we should have been at this point

1521
01:15:35,359 --> 01:15:39,920
when we first started so do you know

1522
01:15:37,430 --> 01:15:42,200
know that and I think we should have

1523
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:45,260
been using closed-loop systems and cold

1524
01:15:42,199 --> 01:15:47,479
traps and all that when concentrates

1525
01:15:45,260 --> 01:15:49,489
first when I first learned how to make

1526
01:15:47,479 --> 01:15:50,449
decent concentrates I was like dude we

1527
01:15:49,489 --> 01:15:52,250
should have been doing this way

1528
01:15:50,449 --> 01:15:54,319
differently for a long time now the

1529
01:15:52,250 --> 01:15:56,390
money there and the money that you

1530
01:15:54,319 --> 01:15:58,039
invested in the material that I invested

1531
01:15:56,390 --> 01:15:59,890
could have been better used towards but

1532
01:15:58,039 --> 01:16:02,600
we didn't know that yeah exactly

1533
01:15:59,890 --> 01:16:04,850
this thing's always evolving yeah and

1534
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:10,160
then I can't complain about any of the

1535
01:16:04,850 --> 01:16:11,450
hash you've made in the past so I don't

1536
01:16:10,159 --> 01:16:17,750
how long you been how long have you been

1537
01:16:11,449 --> 01:16:20,210
killing it about a year friends place

1538
01:16:17,750 --> 01:16:22,189
yeah since then you've been crushing it

1539
01:16:20,210 --> 01:16:24,800
you learn things from Denver and Springs

1540
01:16:22,189 --> 01:16:26,989
that impressed me yeah so you know how

1541
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:28,820
to compensate and are you gonna do you

1542
01:16:26,989 --> 01:16:32,510
know do you have an idea how to figure

1543
01:16:28,819 --> 01:16:35,029
out how to remove the pentane you got to

1544
01:16:32,510 --> 01:16:36,440
go to I took a couple of notes from

1545
01:16:35,029 --> 01:16:39,050
another spot I think it's a hundred and

1546
01:16:36,439 --> 01:16:41,929
six degrees is where pentane starts to

1547
01:16:39,050 --> 01:16:44,300
boil off and that's also where the

1548
01:16:41,930 --> 01:16:45,350
triple anoints burn off so how are you

1549
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:47,420
gonna do you have an idea of how to

1550
01:16:45,350 --> 01:16:49,370
compensate for all that stuff you that's

1551
01:16:47,420 --> 01:16:51,440
what he was talking about with that cold

1552
01:16:49,369 --> 01:16:53,390
trap you're gonna be able to suck those

1553
01:16:51,439 --> 01:16:54,949
gases out in the cold traps there's like

1554
01:16:53,390 --> 01:16:56,390
three chambers and they have different

1555
01:16:54,949 --> 01:17:00,349
filters in them so they all trap

1556
01:16:56,390 --> 01:17:02,930
different things and one of them traps

1557
01:17:00,350 --> 01:17:04,700
terpenoids and so you you just

1558
01:17:02,930 --> 01:17:06,950
reintroduce that back into the hash

1559
01:17:04,699 --> 01:17:08,359
afterwards so you can you trap your

1560
01:17:06,949 --> 01:17:11,260
terpenes that you lose and you

1561
01:17:08,359 --> 01:17:14,479
reintroduce it back into the hash the

1562
01:17:11,260 --> 01:17:16,579
the pentane is not the same molecule

1563
01:17:14,479 --> 01:17:19,849
structure or the same size as the

1564
01:17:16,579 --> 01:17:23,930
terpenoids but it does boil off at a

1565
01:17:19,850 --> 01:17:25,690
similar temperature okay I understand

1566
01:17:23,930 --> 01:17:28,730
what you're saying yeah I catch you it's

1567
01:17:25,689 --> 01:17:31,369
it's a filtration system and a cold trap

1568
01:17:28,729 --> 01:17:33,349
system so between the you put the cold

1569
01:17:31,369 --> 01:17:36,710
trap between the vacuum pump and your

1570
01:17:33,350 --> 01:17:39,170
vacuum oven or chamber Wow so as you're

1571
01:17:36,710 --> 01:17:41,550
you're vacuuming that that gas through

1572
01:17:39,170 --> 01:17:43,859
it traps stuff and it

1573
01:17:41,550 --> 01:17:47,250
let's stuff through that sounds [ __ ]

1574
01:17:43,859 --> 01:17:49,739
brilliant I'm the breeder and the grower

1575
01:17:47,250 --> 01:17:52,260
they're expensive

1576
01:17:49,739 --> 01:17:54,179
that sounds to sciency for me they're

1577
01:17:52,260 --> 01:17:56,070
awesome and I would ruin that I feel I

1578
01:17:54,180 --> 01:17:58,409
feel so comfortable with the plants and

1579
01:17:56,069 --> 01:18:00,920
breeding and growing and here and see I

1580
01:17:58,409 --> 01:18:02,309
don't I feel very comfortable with

1581
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:07,350
sciency stuff

1582
01:18:02,310 --> 01:18:08,850
tima for sure for sure so find us at the

1583
01:18:07,350 --> 01:18:10,590
secret cup this year in Denver

1584
01:18:08,850 --> 01:18:12,900
we'll be roaming around together I'm

1585
01:18:10,590 --> 01:18:19,230
tall I'm a white guy with dreadlocks I'm

1586
01:18:12,899 --> 01:18:22,920
sure we're wearing hoodies and

1587
01:18:19,229 --> 01:18:25,289
grassroots hats you know we'll have our

1588
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:28,470
genetic shirts or elevated concentration

1589
01:18:25,289 --> 01:18:31,109
shirts or mixture of the two I'll have

1590
01:18:28,470 --> 01:18:32,550
red eyes so uh I look forward to it I

1591
01:18:31,109 --> 01:18:35,039
look forward the Cannabis Cup is coming

1592
01:18:32,550 --> 01:18:36,449
up but I'm I'm just going I'm not

1593
01:18:35,039 --> 01:18:37,590
promoting it I don't have a booth there

1594
01:18:36,449 --> 01:18:44,099
anything I've got a bunch of friends

1595
01:18:37,590 --> 01:18:46,560
with booths we're gonna have a good time

1596
01:18:44,100 --> 01:18:48,900
so I read a post from a well-respected

1597
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:51,870
member of the hash community on Facebook

1598
01:18:48,899 --> 01:18:53,579
no let me on Facebook I read a post he's

1599
01:18:51,869 --> 01:18:55,949
well respected everywhere not just on

1600
01:18:53,579 --> 01:18:59,250
facing clear about that [ __ ] this guy

1601
01:18:55,949 --> 01:19:02,159
throws this secret cup he throws the

1602
01:18:59,250 --> 01:19:04,439
dabs of Denver he he did the dabs of

1603
01:19:02,159 --> 01:19:07,139
Denver event and gave all of the

1604
01:19:04,439 --> 01:19:08,489
proceeds to a care center I don't know

1605
01:19:07,140 --> 01:19:09,990
the official word a care center so that

1606
01:19:08,489 --> 01:19:11,909
they could buy themselves a van to get

1607
01:19:09,989 --> 01:19:13,500
their residents to and from their

1608
01:19:11,909 --> 01:19:15,000
doctor's appointments and this dude puts

1609
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:16,800
his heart and soul into what he does and

1610
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:19,890
bro you got my mad loved the guy I'm

1611
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:21,239
talking about his Big B he posts on

1612
01:19:19,890 --> 01:19:22,829
Facebook and I'm kind of terrified

1613
01:19:21,239 --> 01:19:24,659
paraphrasing and chopped into pieces

1614
01:19:22,829 --> 01:19:27,809
here so that it makes a good show but it

1615
01:19:24,659 --> 01:19:30,119
says a rat in a lab can handle 6,800

1616
01:19:27,810 --> 01:19:33,030
PPM's of pentane with every single

1617
01:19:30,119 --> 01:19:37,199
breath it takes for 120 hours straight

1618
01:19:33,029 --> 01:19:39,389
and have no discernable effects he also

1619
01:19:37,199 --> 01:19:41,880
advised to make sure that before you eat

1620
01:19:39,390 --> 01:19:44,270
BHO you don't you decarboxylase it and

1621
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:49,409
that will make sure you get rid of most

1622
01:19:44,270 --> 01:19:50,550
residual carbons gasses things you don't

1623
01:19:49,409 --> 01:19:54,000
want

1624
01:19:50,550 --> 01:19:55,150
he also says excuse me dabs are clogging

1625
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:57,119
me up

1626
01:19:55,149 --> 01:20:00,069
this is if you choose to inhale BHO

1627
01:19:57,119 --> 01:20:03,279
please make sure that you heat your dab

1628
01:20:00,069 --> 01:20:05,469
up to 600 degrees at least until it

1629
01:20:03,279 --> 01:20:07,059
vaporizes and then filter it through

1630
01:20:05,469 --> 01:20:08,529
water and by through water he doesn't

1631
01:20:07,060 --> 01:20:12,460
mean filter it he means use a bong a

1632
01:20:08,529 --> 01:20:14,439
water pipe a bubbler yeah yeah some

1633
01:20:12,460 --> 01:20:16,149
don't do the dry hit dabs and while

1634
01:20:14,439 --> 01:20:17,859
we're at it don't use shitty Chinese

1635
01:20:16,149 --> 01:20:20,049
import glass made by some [ __ ] little

1636
01:20:17,859 --> 01:20:22,359
kid without protective gear yeah please

1637
01:20:20,050 --> 01:20:25,360
buy american-made if you know a glass

1638
01:20:22,359 --> 01:20:27,099
blower try to support them indeed indeed

1639
01:20:25,359 --> 01:20:30,670
especially if they're good yeah they'll

1640
01:20:27,100 --> 01:20:34,840
get better you'll have something from

1641
01:20:30,670 --> 01:20:37,779
the beginning when they're in the glass

1642
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:39,130
galleries next to our heroes what I bet

1643
01:20:37,779 --> 01:20:40,899
the people that have a coil piece from

1644
01:20:39,130 --> 01:20:42,460
back in the day or ultra proud what if

1645
01:20:40,899 --> 01:20:46,299
your next glassblower friend becomes

1646
01:20:42,460 --> 01:20:50,039
coil condenser man so man we're all

1647
01:20:46,300 --> 01:20:52,810
using the email and I I don't think a

1648
01:20:50,039 --> 01:20:55,269
lot of us are heating it to 600 degrees

1649
01:20:52,810 --> 01:20:57,280
because there's that low low temp dab

1650
01:20:55,270 --> 01:21:00,699
sensation that's been going on the craze

1651
01:20:57,279 --> 01:21:03,069
with the emails and carb cap yes is that

1652
01:21:00,698 --> 01:21:05,439
gonna be a thing of the past or are are

1653
01:21:03,069 --> 01:21:10,359
we too stubborn Diesel's

1654
01:21:05,439 --> 01:21:12,219
so well I that's gonna go that's gonna

1655
01:21:10,359 --> 01:21:13,988
change with technique and as people

1656
01:21:12,219 --> 01:21:15,850
develop their technique to get rid of

1657
01:21:13,988 --> 01:21:18,908
this pentane thing because it's just

1658
01:21:15,850 --> 01:21:20,949
like they said it evaporates the same at

1659
01:21:18,908 --> 01:21:26,139
a similar temperature as the terpenes so

1660
01:21:20,948 --> 01:21:28,658
if you're doing a low tamp dab well it

1661
01:21:26,140 --> 01:21:31,630
tastes better because you're conserving

1662
01:21:28,658 --> 01:21:34,299
more of the Terps and if you do a higher

1663
01:21:31,630 --> 01:21:36,760
temp tab you're getting rid of more of

1664
01:21:34,300 --> 01:21:38,770
the gas like he's saying yeah it doesn't

1665
01:21:36,760 --> 01:21:41,650
taste as good so that would only you

1666
01:21:38,770 --> 01:21:43,719
know that's makes sense most of the

1667
01:21:41,649 --> 01:21:45,609
people that dad was you know that I kind

1668
01:21:43,719 --> 01:21:52,840
of knocked the low temp dab thing that's

1669
01:21:45,609 --> 01:21:54,219
not my style I like those beer in the

1670
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:55,989
middle kind of feels like you're

1671
01:21:54,219 --> 01:21:57,939
drowning and disco dancing at the same

1672
01:21:55,988 --> 01:21:59,408
time I love those dads I mean once we

1673
01:21:57,939 --> 01:22:01,750
start getting rid of a lot of these

1674
01:21:59,408 --> 01:22:04,539
gasses again and developing our

1675
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:05,890
technique to be even better we're going

1676
01:22:04,539 --> 01:22:10,000
to be able to do those low temp

1677
01:22:05,890 --> 01:22:13,180
ABB's and not inhale however thousands

1678
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:15,880
of ppm pentane big up to steep hill for

1679
01:22:13,180 --> 01:22:19,539
helping me not further harm my lungs

1680
01:22:15,880 --> 01:22:21,159
with useless garbage yes so a couple a

1681
01:22:19,539 --> 01:22:22,720
couple episodes where am i this is

1682
01:22:21,159 --> 01:22:30,099
number two it had to be the last episode

1683
01:22:22,720 --> 01:22:31,990
I'm pretty sure I bet so I bet that in

1684
01:22:30,100 --> 01:22:33,100
episode number one you said something

1685
01:22:31,989 --> 01:22:36,550
about dewaxing

1686
01:22:33,100 --> 01:22:38,560
you mentioned dewaxing sure did you are

1687
01:22:36,550 --> 01:22:40,029
gonna become my hash expert on my on my

1688
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:40,390
little podcaster I hope you're aware of

1689
01:22:40,029 --> 01:22:42,989
that

1690
01:22:40,390 --> 01:22:49,990
[Music]

1691
01:22:42,989 --> 01:22:51,729
can you define and then here's my

1692
01:22:49,989 --> 01:22:53,649
disclaimer for you kids not a scientist

1693
01:22:51,729 --> 01:22:55,269
you did not go to science school don't

1694
01:22:53,649 --> 01:22:57,399
try this [ __ ] at home we're not

1695
01:22:55,270 --> 01:23:00,190
responsible be a [ __ ] that don't read

1696
01:22:57,399 --> 01:23:02,170
a book go to school read a book in the

1697
01:23:00,189 --> 01:23:04,989
book read a [ __ ] book I did

1698
01:23:02,170 --> 01:23:07,449
need some books but so yet don't sue us

1699
01:23:04,989 --> 01:23:11,019
and Kem's a hash maker not a scientist

1700
01:23:07,449 --> 01:23:14,470
or a professor or something like well

1701
01:23:11,020 --> 01:23:17,650
dewaxing from my knowledge is when as

1702
01:23:14,470 --> 01:23:22,720
you're making the concentrate in the

1703
01:23:17,649 --> 01:23:26,819
process you use cold temperatures to

1704
01:23:22,720 --> 01:23:32,980
separate plant fats and lipids and waxes

1705
01:23:26,819 --> 01:23:35,710
from the the oils because your your

1706
01:23:32,979 --> 01:23:40,359
cannabinoids and your terpenoids are

1707
01:23:35,710 --> 01:23:41,859
pretty much all oil form so slightly

1708
01:23:40,359 --> 01:23:45,789
different polarities with each of the

1709
01:23:41,859 --> 01:23:48,309
molecules what have you but the you the

1710
01:23:45,789 --> 01:23:52,329
cold actually separates the wax to the

1711
01:23:48,310 --> 01:23:54,370
bottom allows you to after time you know

1712
01:23:52,329 --> 01:23:56,289
you let it sit for a little while the

1713
01:23:54,369 --> 01:23:58,510
layers separate and then you can pour

1714
01:23:56,289 --> 01:24:00,609
the oil through a filter just in case

1715
01:23:58,510 --> 01:24:03,070
any of that wax is loose you can filter

1716
01:24:00,609 --> 01:24:05,799
it out with lab filter paper so at one

1717
01:24:03,069 --> 01:24:07,090
point you're basically you've got your

1718
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:08,440
dabs where they're liquid I've seen at

1719
01:24:07,090 --> 01:24:10,210
that point it's slushy and now you're

1720
01:24:08,439 --> 01:24:12,549
pouring it into something and that's

1721
01:24:10,210 --> 01:24:14,140
settling essentially you have okay

1722
01:24:12,550 --> 01:24:16,060
yeah and the chunky part is what we

1723
01:24:14,140 --> 01:24:19,300
don't want to suggest plant paraffins

1724
01:24:16,060 --> 01:24:22,570
yeah what else is it lipids black

1725
01:24:19,300 --> 01:24:28,090
is and battles are like the cellular

1726
01:24:22,569 --> 01:24:29,408
structure of the plant right yes I want

1727
01:24:28,090 --> 01:24:32,170
to do an experiment and this is off

1728
01:24:29,408 --> 01:24:34,000
topic I want to see if we run silicates

1729
01:24:32,170 --> 01:24:35,289
potassium silicates in a plant if it

1730
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,789
makes a difference on the amount of wax

1731
01:24:35,289 --> 01:24:38,920
you take out so what do you do that

1732
01:24:36,789 --> 01:24:40,569
if anybody has a grow room and you can

1733
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:43,630
do that if you have a hash guy that is

1734
01:24:40,569 --> 01:24:47,738
doing this I'd like to see our potassium

1735
01:24:43,630 --> 01:24:50,139
silicates affecting our wax and dewaxing

1736
01:24:47,738 --> 01:24:51,279
processes and [ __ ] up our hash so

1737
01:24:50,139 --> 01:24:52,750
keep going dude I'm sorry to interrupt I

1738
01:24:51,279 --> 01:24:54,250
make the picture clear you got like this

1739
01:24:52,750 --> 01:24:58,118
big can't in my mind you've got a big

1740
01:24:54,250 --> 01:25:00,340
container of butane hash mixture he

1741
01:24:58,118 --> 01:25:01,630
parts sinking to the bottom yeah okay it

1742
01:25:00,340 --> 01:25:06,659
looks it's the opposite of beer the

1743
01:25:01,630 --> 01:25:08,770
heads on the bottom yeah okay and then

1744
01:25:06,658 --> 01:25:14,069
essentially that goes through a

1745
01:25:08,770 --> 01:25:17,139
filtration and this they make

1746
01:25:14,069 --> 01:25:19,349
essentially closed sealed dewaxing

1747
01:25:17,139 --> 01:25:21,819
chambers with regulators and all that

1748
01:25:19,349 --> 01:25:23,440
it's essentially the same process it

1749
01:25:21,819 --> 01:25:26,289
still needs to be in a cold bath to get

1750
01:25:23,439 --> 01:25:30,578
the separation all of that so you

1751
01:25:26,289 --> 01:25:34,590
transfer that oil into the hot water

1752
01:25:30,578 --> 01:25:36,849
bath or hot water container chamber

1753
01:25:34,590 --> 01:25:40,960
depends on the system everything's going

1754
01:25:36,849 --> 01:25:42,969
to closed-loop now so it's all

1755
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:44,500
technically the same you still do it the

1756
01:25:42,969 --> 01:25:46,569
same way it's just all in a closed

1757
01:25:44,500 --> 01:25:51,929
system now which makes it much easier

1758
01:25:46,569 --> 01:25:54,460
safer higher quality definitely okay and

1759
01:25:51,929 --> 01:25:57,219
that just removes all that harmful plant

1760
01:25:54,460 --> 01:26:00,130
matter from from the concentrates

1761
01:25:57,219 --> 01:26:02,980
because a lot of what what causes the

1762
01:26:00,130 --> 01:26:06,219
congestion and the heavy harshness when

1763
01:26:02,979 --> 01:26:08,888
when you smoke flour is a lot of that is

1764
01:26:06,219 --> 01:26:12,149
is a carcinogenic plant matter now I've

1765
01:26:08,889 --> 01:26:12,150
also really that makes people puke

1766
01:26:13,979 --> 01:26:21,218
headaches headed no no we don't want

1767
01:26:19,420 --> 01:26:24,489
that you know medicine counterproductive

1768
01:26:21,219 --> 01:26:26,189
yeah definitely all right so now you've

1769
01:26:24,488 --> 01:26:28,539
taken you run it through a filtration

1770
01:26:26,189 --> 01:26:31,118
you pour that [ __ ] through like a funnel

1771
01:26:28,539 --> 01:26:32,500
and it filters out mm-hm and then then

1772
01:26:31,118 --> 01:26:33,159
it goes to the back purge essentially

1773
01:26:32,500 --> 01:26:34,810
yeah

1774
01:26:33,159 --> 01:26:36,970
and I think most of the hash makers

1775
01:26:34,810 --> 01:26:38,800
understand that uh and if you don't

1776
01:26:36,970 --> 01:26:40,720
understand that's cool because it's not

1777
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:42,340
you're gonna have to do research we may

1778
01:26:40,720 --> 01:26:44,140
leave [ __ ] out so that you have to yeah

1779
01:26:42,340 --> 01:26:46,329
we don't want to guide you into yeah

1780
01:26:44,140 --> 01:26:48,610
[ __ ] yourself or any of my friends or

1781
01:26:46,329 --> 01:26:51,670
any of your patients uh yeah you use you

1782
01:26:48,609 --> 01:26:55,630
know screen mesh things like that to

1783
01:26:51,670 --> 01:26:57,670
filter whatever size of whatever you're

1784
01:26:55,630 --> 01:26:59,350
trying to get out do different two

1785
01:26:57,670 --> 01:27:00,489
different strains require different size

1786
01:26:59,350 --> 01:27:02,500
screen meshes like when you're making

1787
01:27:00,489 --> 01:27:04,779
the oval from when I've noticed yes

1788
01:27:02,500 --> 01:27:08,470
different different strains have

1789
01:27:04,779 --> 01:27:10,989
different trichome sizes and that will

1790
01:27:08,470 --> 01:27:13,930
affect your yield in extraction if you

1791
01:27:10,989 --> 01:27:15,399
don't use different filters sizes makes

1792
01:27:13,930 --> 01:27:18,369
complete sense and it will affect your

1793
01:27:15,399 --> 01:27:19,989
purity levels to think if you if you

1794
01:27:18,369 --> 01:27:22,840
have smaller trichomes and you're using

1795
01:27:19,989 --> 01:27:25,179
a bigger filter you're gonna get a lot

1796
01:27:22,840 --> 01:27:28,210
more of that nasty whack stuff in there

1797
01:27:25,180 --> 01:27:31,960
oh yeah I can just at least solvent what

1798
01:27:28,210 --> 01:27:33,369
[ __ ] that makes so good good description

1799
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:35,350
Brussels what more question I have about

1800
01:27:33,369 --> 01:27:37,779
that does that how does that affect your

1801
01:27:35,350 --> 01:27:39,850
yield is it worth you know I haven't

1802
01:27:37,779 --> 01:27:42,219
seen it affect my yield and enough of a

1803
01:27:39,850 --> 01:27:44,530
negative way to change what I'm doing it

1804
01:27:42,220 --> 01:27:47,670
since you started doing it for me the

1805
01:27:44,529 --> 01:27:51,579
hash hasn't come back like lighter yeah

1806
01:27:47,670 --> 01:27:52,779
yeah sweet yeah when you don't take out

1807
01:27:51,579 --> 01:27:55,600
the waxes I've noticed you get the heavy

1808
01:27:52,779 --> 01:27:57,429
lungs I dab with other people and I know

1809
01:27:55,600 --> 01:28:00,970
who is dewaxing and who's not usually

1810
01:27:57,430 --> 01:28:03,490
after a couple of times you can also

1811
01:28:00,970 --> 01:28:07,780
tell because if you don't do ax it'll

1812
01:28:03,489 --> 01:28:10,269
leave residual particles on your nail is

1813
01:28:07,779 --> 01:28:11,559
that why I got a replace and or scrape

1814
01:28:10,270 --> 01:28:13,330
my nail every once a while and I know I

1815
01:28:11,560 --> 01:28:16,120
shouldn't scrape it but I can't [ __ ]

1816

1852
01:29:49,399 --> 01:29:55,719
farm research calm farm with the pH

1853

told me they're posted on Facebook that

1856
01:30:01,069 --> 01:30:05,420
that was a good site to look for hash

1857
01:30:02,720 --> 01:30:07,640
information you know I need to tract

1858
01:30:05,420 --> 01:30:12,500
myself lower temps the boiling point of

1859
01:30:07,640 --> 01:30:13,970
pentane is 97 degrees I said 9606 yeah I

1860
01:30:12,500 --> 01:30:15,859
did see I'm [ __ ] lying

1861
01:30:13,970 --> 01:30:19,940
yes it's 97 which I just want to be

1862
01:30:15,859 --> 01:30:21,529
accurate yeah so yeah I just wanna track

1863

like he took a nap while he was there

1877
01:30:52,539 --> 01:30:56,930
it's like a six-foot bong it's probably

1878

wait extradition to the USA and on May

1940
01:33:18,939 --> 01:33:23,050
the 10th of 2010 Justice Minister Rob

1941
01:33:21,340 --> 01:33:24,909
Nicholson signed the order and ordered

1942
01:33:23,050 --> 01:33:29,469
Emery to surrender to authorities which

1943
01:33:24,908 --> 01:33:33,429
he did this same day [ __ ]

1944
01:33:29,469 --> 01:33:35,439
on May 10 2010 jester Menace justice

1945
01:33:33,429 --> 01:33:37,149
minister Nicholson ruled Emery be

1946
01:33:35,439 --> 01:33:39,039
extradited to the United States where

1947
01:33:37,149 --> 01:33:40,988
Mark faced five years in the US penal

1948
01:33:39,038 --> 01:33:43,059
system the possibility existed that

1949
01:33:40,988 --> 01:33:45,218
Emery may be allowed to serve all or

1950
01:33:43,059 --> 01:33:50,010
part of his sentence in Canada but US

1951
01:33:45,219 --> 01:33:52,208
authorities rejected this option

1952
01:33:50,010 --> 01:33:54,189
rejected no you got to come to America

1953
01:33:52,208 --> 01:33:55,958
so Henry was extradited to the United

1954
01:33:54,189 --> 01:33:58,209
States on May 24th he appeared in a

1955
01:33:55,958 --> 01:34:00,458
Seattle courtroom and pleaded guilty to

1956
01:33:58,208 --> 01:34:02,920
one count of conspiracy to manufacture

1957
01:34:00,458 --> 01:34:04,658
marijuana he had to plead guilty because

1958
01:34:02,920 --> 01:34:06,429
I mean imagine the [ __ ] court

1959
01:34:04,658 --> 01:34:09,038
pressure all the lawyers all the

1960
01:34:06,429 --> 01:34:11,349
[ __ ] up against him take all your

1961
01:34:09,038 --> 01:34:13,988
money and that's part of what this they

1962
01:34:11,349 --> 01:34:15,550
think this was about politics mark was

1963
01:34:13,988 --> 01:34:19,569
heavily involved in politics and stuff

1964
01:34:15,550 --> 01:34:21,550
and they think marks people think that

1965
01:34:19,569 --> 01:34:22,988
they were trying to take take all of his

1966
01:34:21,550 --> 01:34:24,070
money because he made a lot of money

1967
01:34:22,988 --> 01:34:24,998
selling seeds and they were trying to

1968
01:34:24,069 --> 01:34:28,208
take his money and get him out of

1969
01:34:24,998 --> 01:34:29,529
politics so on September 10th 2010 in a

1970
01:34:28,208 --> 01:34:32,019
Seattle courtroom mark Emery was

1971
01:34:29,529 --> 01:34:33,938
sentenced to five years in prison US

1972
01:34:32,019 --> 01:34:35,920
District Court Judge Ricardo Martinez

1973
01:34:33,939 --> 01:34:37,479
sentence Emery stating there was no

1974
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:39,609
question his actions were criminal and

1975
01:34:37,479 --> 01:34:45,340
that Emery ensured others broke the law

1976
01:34:39,609 --> 01:34:46,598
by selling them seeds there's so many

1977
01:34:45,340 --> 01:34:49,029
things that go through my head right now

1978
01:34:46,599 --> 01:34:50,769
cannabis seeds they're a little bit's to

1979
01:34:49,029 --> 01:34:55,478
preserve their souvenirs their

1980
01:34:50,769 --> 01:34:57,280
preservation their gifts I mean probably

1981
01:34:55,479 --> 01:34:59,229
thirty percent of those were ever

1982
01:34:57,279 --> 01:35:00,670
actually grown and I'm sure he made

1983
01:34:59,229 --> 01:35:02,019
people promised they wouldn't germinate

1984
01:35:00,670 --> 01:35:04,349
them that's what you do on it what's

1985
01:35:02,019 --> 01:35:08,590
what they do on a seed site apparently

1986
01:35:04,349 --> 01:35:10,300
allegedly alright so the court noted

1987
01:35:08,590 --> 01:35:12,998
that Emery claimed on his website to

1988
01:35:10,300 --> 01:35:15,070
have made some three million dollars a

1989
01:35:12,998 --> 01:35:17,708
year from selling seeds from his

1990
01:35:15,069 --> 01:35:19,149
Vancouver headquarters hate to call you

1991
01:35:17,708 --> 01:35:20,948
out mark that was a [ __ ] mistake

1992
01:35:19,149 --> 01:35:24,009
don't ever say you made three million

1993
01:35:20,948 --> 01:35:25,529
dollars selling seeds don't ever [ __ ]

1994
01:35:24,010 --> 01:35:28,570
talk about how much money you made

1995
01:35:25,529 --> 01:35:30,368
that's my personal advice in the hair so

1996
01:35:28,569 --> 01:35:32,229
amarty donated almost all of the money

1997
01:35:30,368 --> 01:35:34,268
generated from his seed sales to

1998
01:35:32,229 --> 01:35:35,768
marijuana policy reform efforts

1999
01:35:34,269 --> 01:35:37,170
he just redeemed your fuck-ups for

2000
01:35:35,769 --> 01:35:39,880
bragging about your money in my mind

2001
01:35:37,170 --> 01:35:42,149
summaries claims at all that his Emery

2002
01:35:39,880 --> 01:35:45,550
claims that his arrest was political

2003
01:35:42,149 --> 01:35:47,109
this was these claims were disputed by

2004
01:35:45,550 --> 01:35:49,000
the prosecution sorry I'm tapped out I'm

2005
01:35:47,109 --> 01:35:51,339

01:36:50,679 --> 01:36:57,309
start releasing all the people there was

2038
01:36:55,090 --> 01:36:59,078
a case that uh it was kind of a

2039
01:36:57,309 --> 01:37:01,420
ridiculous try but they got one lady's

2040

cannabis case overthrown but there was

2041

also there were also other ridiculous

2042
01:37:03,849 --> 01:37:07,989
charges in that case so she's still

incarcerated on those charges but the

2044
01:37:07,988 --> 01:37:11,738
cannabis is erased from the chart

2045
01:37:09,969 --> 01:37:13,929
there's no good but I mean it's still

2046

eating some chips these chips have some

2251
01:46:26,600 --> 01:46:30,130
weird chemical that are making me crave

2252
01:46:35,260 --> 01:46:38,570

I'm sure we will well let's get down to

2260
01:46:52,010 --> 01:46:53,810
business

2261
01:46:52,399 --> 01:46:55,460
hey somebody was responsible for keeping

2262
01:46:53,810 --> 01:46:57,560
a pipe loaded I don't know who I don't I

2263
01:46:55,460 --> 01:47:01,760
didn't know it's not loaded it isn't

2264
01:46:57,560 --> 01:47:05,390
from the wheat is in front of me oh I

2265
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:08,020
forget you like empty well we're

2266
01:47:05,390 --> 01:47:10,579
connoisseurs at this table my friend

2267
01:47:08,020 --> 01:47:13,340
it's still connoisseur level if there's

2268
01:47:10,579 --> 01:47:19,250
still green weed that's okay we're all

2269
01:47:13,340 --> 01:47:20,929
we're smoking on some Sour Diesel Kevin

2270
01:47:19,250 --> 01:47:21,948
made some wax for me this time usually I

2271
01:47:20,929 --> 01:47:23,840
get shattered but he wanted to

2272
01:47:21,948 --> 01:47:26,419
experiment make some wax I have it for a

2273
01:47:23,840 --> 01:47:28,010
while so I wanted to make sure that it

2274
01:47:26,420 --> 01:47:30,890
was like riding a bike and I could still

2275
01:47:28,010 --> 01:47:33,320
accomplish fantastic tasks accomplished

2276
01:47:30,890 --> 01:47:34,520
do you uh you did well done job I like

2277
01:47:33,319 --> 01:47:36,829
it because I could pick it up and just

2278
01:47:34,520 --> 01:47:39,250
drop a big fat glob on yeah sorry that

2279
01:47:36,829 --> 01:47:43,219
was my Mike's Wheatstone your gun

2280
01:47:39,250 --> 01:47:46,550
it's not good or less versed in wax dabs

2281
01:47:43,219 --> 01:47:48,948
etc the difference sirs oh wow the

2282
01:47:46,550 --> 01:47:50,480
shatter you you can drop it but it's

2283
01:47:48,948 --> 01:47:51,979
harder to handle the shatter is a little

2284
01:47:50,479 --> 01:47:53,389
stickier it's due if your fingers are

2285
01:47:51,979 --> 01:47:55,579
warm it'll melt and get sticky and stick

2286
01:47:53,390 --> 01:47:58,489
to your fingers the wax is it doesn't

2287
01:47:55,579 --> 01:48:00,170
stick as much Kevin since this is a

2288
01:47:58,488 --> 01:48:01,428
topic it's a little bit about the

2289
01:48:00,170 --> 01:48:03,579
difference between shatter and wax

2290
01:48:01,429 --> 01:48:05,960
they're essentially the same product or

2291
01:48:03,579 --> 01:48:08,090
they're simply the same product just

2292
01:48:05,960 --> 01:48:10,369
different consistencies and towards the

2293
01:48:08,090 --> 01:48:14,779
end of the process you do a slightly

2294
01:48:10,369 --> 01:48:18,500
different technique with each one it

2295
01:48:14,779 --> 01:48:20,599
involves timing temperatures agitation

2296
01:48:18,500 --> 01:48:22,880
things like that and you can you can

2297
01:48:20,600 --> 01:48:24,920
achieve the different consistencies

2298
01:48:22,880 --> 01:48:26,539
which is essentially all shatter and wax

2299
01:48:24,920 --> 01:48:28,579
are they're just different consistencies

2300
01:48:26,539 --> 01:48:31,158
of the same same thing and a lot of

2301
01:48:28,579 --> 01:48:32,238
people hate on wax I'm I tell everybody

2302
01:48:31,158 --> 01:48:34,219
just stay on the mic i'm over here

2303
01:48:32,238 --> 01:48:37,218
bobbing back then Stevie Wonder I'm high

2304
01:48:34,219 --> 01:48:38,539
dude dab the [ __ ] out eating a sweet

2305
01:48:37,219 --> 01:48:39,739
stone it's a good night it's a wonderful

2306
01:48:38,539 --> 01:48:44,329
night hanging out to my favorite Bros

2307
01:48:39,738 --> 01:48:47,178
even a lot of people hate on chatter -

2308
01:48:44,329 --> 01:48:48,679
there's some people that are just really

2309
01:48:47,179 --> 01:48:50,390
into the wax and that's why I like a lot

2310
01:48:48,679 --> 01:48:52,279
of the conversations that go on with us

2311
01:48:50,390 --> 01:48:56,030
in the 7/10 community with the extract

2312
01:48:52,279 --> 01:48:57,439
artists especially is we're not sharing

2313
01:48:56,029 --> 01:48:59,448
so much information with the public

2314
01:48:57,439 --> 01:49:01,428
anymore we're sharing it a lot with

2315
01:48:59,448 --> 01:49:03,639
ourselves and we're learning a lot more

2316
01:49:01,429 --> 01:49:06,529
about you know what

2317
01:49:03,640 --> 01:49:08,690
what's better and what is actually going

2318
01:49:06,529 --> 01:49:10,550
on with the product so that's really

2319
01:49:08,689 --> 01:49:12,319
nice to see how it continues to evolve

2320
01:49:10,550 --> 01:49:14,829
and the knowledge continues to grow so

2321
01:49:12,319 --> 01:49:18,109
there's a lot of personal opinion on

2322
01:49:14,829 --> 01:49:21,670
indeed whether wax or shatter is

2323
01:49:18,109 --> 01:49:25,460
preferred there's a lot of opinion and

2324
01:49:21,670 --> 01:49:27,079
some some verification of one being

2325
01:49:25,460 --> 01:49:28,310
cleaner than the other so I'll leave

2326
01:49:27,079 --> 01:49:30,229
that up to everybody to go ahead and do

2327
01:49:28,310 --> 01:49:32,060
some research and read it deep because

2328
01:49:30,229 --> 01:49:35,178
I'm gonna kind of spill your beans from

2329
01:49:32,060 --> 01:49:37,219
what I have read from trusted sources I

2330
01:49:35,179 --> 01:49:39,050
have and I have not studied this I've

2331
01:49:37,219 --> 01:49:42,640
read this on Facebook from people that I

2332
01:49:39,050 --> 01:49:45,350
respect the the wax is usually cleaner

2333
01:49:42,640 --> 01:49:46,760
and comes back with less residual

2334
01:49:45,350 --> 01:49:48,800
solvents in there

2335
01:49:46,760 --> 01:49:51,020
yes that's what I bring with me that's

2336
01:49:48,800 --> 01:49:52,760
what I have read as well people that are

2337
01:49:51,020 --> 01:49:54,320
hating the butters or the waxes the

2338
01:49:52,760 --> 01:49:55,850
butter I'm gonna say butter

2339
01:49:54,319 --> 01:49:58,219
I would can I would consider butter

2340
01:49:55,850 --> 01:50:00,200
goofier and stuff that we wouldn't dab

2341
01:49:58,220 --> 01:50:02,030
we wouldn't dab butter if it's runny and

2342
01:50:00,199 --> 01:50:07,639
dripping off your [ __ ] I probably won't

2343
01:50:02,029 --> 01:50:08,509
have that exactly snap yeah I'll hit

2344
01:50:07,640 --> 01:50:11,329
that all day long

2345
01:50:08,510 --> 01:50:12,409
some good crumble if I want to I want to

2346
01:50:11,329 --> 01:50:14,449
put a little bit of it I'm gonna heat

2347
01:50:12,409 --> 01:50:15,949
the nail up and before I inhale you're

2348
01:50:14,449 --> 01:50:17,329
not gonna notice if you give me the dab

2349
01:50:15,949 --> 01:50:20,539
but I'm gonna give it a little sizzle

2350
01:50:17,329 --> 01:50:21,890
test before I inhale I'm a hippie I know

2351
01:50:20,539 --> 01:50:23,449
how to blow a didgeridoo so I know how

2352
01:50:21,890 --> 01:50:26,150
to make it look like I'm inhaling and

2353
01:50:23,449 --> 01:50:27,679
I'm not and that smokes I can get rid of

2354
01:50:26,149 --> 01:50:30,889
that smoke if it sizzles or tastes like

2355
01:50:27,680 --> 01:50:32,810
doodoo I won't take your dab but if it

2356
01:50:30,890 --> 01:50:34,310
looks good I'll hit some wax or yeah the

2357
01:50:32,810 --> 01:50:36,289
reason I like the difference is the

2358
01:50:34,310 --> 01:50:38,120
shatter I got to use the dab right a

2359
01:50:36,289 --> 01:50:40,069
little dab tool takes a little more work

2360
01:50:38,119 --> 01:50:41,539
a little more effort task Rock says the

2361
01:50:40,069 --> 01:50:42,049
tip the dagger tends to chip to shatter

2362
01:50:41,539 --> 01:50:46,519
in my eye

2363
01:50:42,050 --> 01:50:47,930
ow if you ever knows that the first time

2364
01:50:46,520 --> 01:50:48,890
you buy shatter from the dispensary

2365
01:50:47,930 --> 01:50:49,909
you're gonna take it home and you're

2366
01:50:48,890 --> 01:50:51,050
gonna get your little dad tool and

2367
01:50:49,909 --> 01:50:52,550
you're gonna stick it in that [ __ ]

2368
01:50:51,050 --> 01:50:54,170
shatter and you're gonna break off a

2369
01:50:52,550 --> 01:50:56,810
piece and it's gonna fly across the room

2370
01:50:54,170 --> 01:50:58,520
and you're never gonna be pissed

2371
01:50:56,810 --> 01:50:59,930
that's one dad for your dead home you

2372
01:50:58,520 --> 01:51:03,890
just have to get used to that yeah

2373
01:50:59,930 --> 01:51:05,119
that's if you haven't experienced that

2374
01:51:03,890 --> 01:51:06,320
yet use your thumb and just rub your

2375
01:51:05,119 --> 01:51:07,640
thumb on there and eat that [ __ ] up a

2376
01:51:06,319 --> 01:51:09,529
little bit till it comes pliable you're

2377
01:51:07,640 --> 01:51:11,180
gonna have a big thumbprint Polly deal

2378
01:51:09,529 --> 01:51:13,909
talk [ __ ] quit putting your fingerprints

2379
01:51:11,180 --> 01:51:14,900
all over my damn shanna but there's just

2380
01:51:13,909 --> 01:51:18,559
you turn and they heat it up a little

2381
01:51:14,899 --> 01:51:20,629
bit but but I like the wax because I can

2382
01:51:18,560 --> 01:51:21,800
grab however big of a piece I want and

2383
01:51:20,630 --> 01:51:23,119
squish it together and make a nice

2384
01:51:21,800 --> 01:51:25,100
little ball and then heat up my nail and

2385
01:51:23,119 --> 01:51:26,359
just slam dunk it like a Michael Jordan

2386
01:51:25,100 --> 01:51:30,289
on that [ __ ] and get it nice and

2387
01:51:26,359 --> 01:51:32,899
the wax the consistency makes it punch

2388
01:51:30,289 --> 01:51:35,180
me harder on the hit it makes it seems

2389
01:51:32,899 --> 01:51:36,710
like it does really does this shatter

2390
01:51:35,180 --> 01:51:40,369
I'll admit it shatter is slightly

2391
01:51:36,710 --> 01:51:42,619
smoother SAP is really smooth but the

2392
01:51:40,369 --> 01:51:45,710
[ __ ] I like that heavy and it's not

2393
01:51:42,619 --> 01:51:47,750
heavy like when you're smoking co2 oil I

2394
01:51:45,710 --> 01:51:49,460
do not like that's my personal

2395
01:51:47,750 --> 01:51:51,560
preference it always makes me feel like

2396
01:51:49,460 --> 01:51:55,340
it's bubbly in my lungs it's heavy I'm

2397
01:51:51,560 --> 01:51:57,230
drowning in myself to labor but the the

2398
01:51:55,340 --> 01:51:58,310
wax gives me a pleasant punch like it's

2399
01:51:57,229 --> 01:51:59,839
so like remember when you're in high

2400
01:51:58,310 --> 01:52:00,560
school and you take a big [ __ ] bong

2401
01:51:59,840 --> 01:52:04,190
and you

2402
01:52:00,560 --> 01:52:06,440

2430
01:53:04,340 --> 01:53:08,090
take dabs it would be [ __ ] cool but I

2431

want to manage myself at two or three

2432
01:53:08,090 --> 01:53:13,850
different points urine and blood and

2433

2438
01:53:22,789 --> 01:53:26,989

gonna try to like make it not as

2441
01:53:29,659 --> 01:53:32,149
expensive as it should be because he

2442

01:58:17,170 --> 01:58:20,099

2561
01:58:18,729 --> 01:58:22,289
are 9 or 12 times

2562
01:58:20,099 --> 01:58:24,119
and it's never been as frickin Clippers

2563
01:58:22,289 --> 01:58:25,590
I've never seen either of those artists

2564
01:58:24,118 --> 01:58:27,630
and those are two of my favorite rap

2565
01:58:25,590 --> 01:58:29,760
artists for him you probably paid 60 or

2566
01:58:27,630 --> 01:58:40,170
70 don't see either ones that light to

2567
01:58:29,760 --> 01:58:42,270
her for 20 they both do it our I be cool

2568
01:58:40,170 --> 01:58:45,000
I'd love to go to I want to see him on a

2569
01:58:42,270 --> 01:58:47,070
more or indoor venue so I finished the

2570
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:48,300
pink piece of this Wheatstone I'm

2571
01:58:47,069 --> 01:58:49,529
letting that flavor get out I'm about to

2572
01:58:48,300 --> 01:59:02,279
throw in the blue piece and see if it

2573
01:58:49,529 --> 01:59:04,948
tastes any differently it was [ __ ]

2574
01:59:02,279 --> 01:59:07,550
disgusting it tastes the same as far as

2575
01:59:04,948 --> 01:59:10,549
my taste buds can tell it may have a

2576
01:59:07,550 --> 01:59:12,690
thicker more it may have more flavor but

2577
01:59:10,550 --> 01:59:14,219
my tongue is going numb from all the

2578
01:59:12,689 --> 01:59:15,839
meta sucking on him real slowly I

2579
01:59:14,219 --> 01:59:17,609
noticed last time I eat these I ate the

2580
01:59:15,840 --> 01:59:18,779
whole pack is slowly as I could sucking

2581
01:59:17,609 --> 01:59:20,189
on them in a comedy show to not have

2582
01:59:18,779 --> 01:59:22,229
cotton mouth and not have to piss every

2583
01:59:20,189 --> 01:59:23,428
10 minutes they they weren't greatly for

2584
01:59:22,229 --> 01:59:25,109

2679
02:03:25,899 --> 02:03:28,539
something out of that phenotype and it

2680
02:03:27,369 --> 02:03:29,529
wasn't what I was looking for and I

2681

2691
02:03:52,090 --> 02:03:57,460
in technique from a couple months ago to

2692
02:03:54,369 --> 02:03:59,229

learned a lot from you this makes

2694
02:03:59,229 --> 02:04:02,799
perfect you know I'm often impressed by

2695
02:04:01,149 --> 02:04:05,469
the really do much knowledge that I see

2696
02:04:02,800 --> 02:04:07,300
you gain cuz we're hanging out we're not

2697
02:04:05,470 --> 02:04:15,699
you're not going anywhere so yeah [ __ ]

2698
02:04:07,300 --> 02:04:18,130
did you learn that question I texted you

2699
02:04:15,699 --> 02:04:19,029
about can I do you want to discuss that

2700
02:04:18,130 --> 02:04:28,770
on the air is that something you'd

2701
02:04:19,029 --> 02:04:31,269
rather keep on the down-low let's do it

2702
02:04:28,770 --> 02:04:33,460
we talked about cold traps and pulling

2703
02:04:31,270 --> 02:04:35,260
Mike just goes wander off he's not gonna

2704
02:04:33,460 --> 02:04:36,699
cough into the mic he's too respectful

2705
02:04:35,260 --> 02:04:37,989
for that if we don't if we don't hear

2706
02:04:36,699 --> 02:04:41,470
from him in ten minutes we gotta go find

2707
02:04:37,989 --> 02:04:47,329
him I don't know what

2708
02:04:41,470 --> 02:04:51,170
okay this episode will be trainwreck

2709
02:04:47,329 --> 02:04:54,500
number three so we're using cold traps

2710
02:04:51,170 --> 02:04:55,909
and we're pulling out the gases and the

2711
02:04:54,500 --> 02:04:59,180
leftover contaminants and we're also

2712
02:04:55,909 --> 02:05:00,130
separating terpenoids and then you said

2713
02:04:59,180 --> 02:05:02,360
something that caught my attention

2714
02:05:00,130 --> 02:05:04,039
reintroduce the terpenoids back into the

2715
02:05:02,359 --> 02:05:05,779
finished product so that it's tasty and

2716
02:05:04,039 --> 02:05:07,689
contains terpenoids which also affect

2717
02:05:05,779 --> 02:05:11,059
your high in your medicinal qualities

2718
02:05:07,689 --> 02:05:13,159
could i hypothetically save that cold

2719
02:05:11,060 --> 02:05:15,740
trap set those terpenoids aside to run

2720
02:05:13,159 --> 02:05:17,599
another batch gather those terpenoids

2721
02:05:15,739 --> 02:05:18,920
set them aside run another batch and

2722
02:05:17,600 --> 02:05:20,840
introduce all three batches of

2723
02:05:18,920 --> 02:05:23,720
terpenoids into one batch of smaller

2724
02:05:20,840 --> 02:05:27,800
hash you could do that there is there is

2725
02:05:23,720 --> 02:05:31,730
a point of overdoing that takes a little

2726
02:05:27,800 --> 02:05:33,560
bit of a explanation but oh there's a

2727
02:05:31,729 --> 02:05:35,839
point of overdone everything's yes yes

2728
02:05:33,560 --> 02:05:37,940
so I think it would take some

2729
02:05:35,840 --> 02:05:39,650
experimentation to figure out what what

2730
02:05:37,939 --> 02:05:42,079
would be overdoing and what would be

2731
02:05:39,649 --> 02:05:45,949
where you wanted it to be and I think

2732
02:05:42,079 --> 02:05:49,699
also a better use would necessarily get

2733
02:05:45,949 --> 02:05:52,039
more flavor but to save different

2734
02:05:49,699 --> 02:05:55,960
terpenes that you trap from different

2735
02:05:52,039 --> 02:05:58,189
cannabis so because there's different

2736
02:05:55,960 --> 02:06:00,619
concentrations of different terpene

2737
02:05:58,189 --> 02:06:03,199
molecules okay so take those different

2738
02:06:00,619 --> 02:06:06,529
terpene molecules combine those in a

2739
02:06:03,199 --> 02:06:08,179
ratio for certain ailments because the

2740
02:06:06,529 --> 02:06:10,969
terpenoids have been have been known to

2741
02:06:08,180 --> 02:06:13,760
help with certain conditions and help

2742
02:06:10,970 --> 02:06:15,949
with how we receive the cannabinoids so

2743
02:06:13,760 --> 02:06:19,100
I think that would be a better and more

2744
02:06:15,949 --> 02:06:22,729
practical use for it is the combination

2745
02:06:19,100 --> 02:06:25,910
of certain terpene profiles does the

2746
02:06:22,729 --> 02:06:27,889
future bring us isolating the

2747
02:06:25,909 --> 02:06:30,590
cannabinoids specifically are we gonna

2748
02:06:27,890 --> 02:06:32,210
lie think it I think we're gonna be able

2749
02:06:30,590 --> 02:06:36,079
to in the future

2750
02:06:32,210 --> 02:06:37,909
definitely isolate several cannabinoids

2751
02:06:36,079 --> 02:06:40,460
if not all of them and several

2752
02:06:37,909 --> 02:06:43,039
terpenoids as well readily identify them

2753
02:06:40,460 --> 02:06:45,590
and separate them probably through a

2754
02:06:43,039 --> 02:06:48,140
couple it would it would take a couple

2755
02:06:45,590 --> 02:06:51,500
different processes like almost like a

2756
02:06:48,140 --> 02:06:53,949
condensation reaction along with your

2757
02:06:51,500 --> 02:07:00,198
normal solvent reaction

2758
02:06:53,948 --> 02:07:02,089
to get specific my follow you yeah yes

2759
02:07:00,198 --> 02:07:04,609
if ik molecules out of each one you know

2760
02:07:02,090 --> 02:07:08,739
I get we'd have to purify it like they

2761
02:07:04,609 --> 02:07:11,719
do gases and things your you know like

2762
02:07:08,738 --> 02:07:13,879
Addison was I think Addison mentioned or

2763
02:07:11,719 --> 02:07:17,270
I'm a met mentioned on one of the past

2764
02:07:13,880 --> 02:07:19,760
shows the butane and pentane SF all

2765
02:07:17,270 --> 02:07:22,010
comes from petroleum that's you know

2766
02:07:19,760 --> 02:07:25,159
refined into those gases based on their

2767
02:07:22,010 --> 02:07:27,860
boiling points so it's gonna take

2768
02:07:25,158 --> 02:07:31,069
several reactions like that to be able

2769
02:07:27,859 --> 02:07:33,229
to refine terpenoids cannabinoids I

2770
02:07:31,069 --> 02:07:36,558
think we're gonna start to discover the

2771
02:07:33,229 --> 02:07:39,229
differences in them and each molecule ur

2772
02:07:36,559 --> 02:07:40,579
structures specific melting points

2773
02:07:39,229 --> 02:07:42,169
boiling points and things and we'll be

2774
02:07:40,578 --> 02:07:44,058
able to separate that and reintroduce

2775
02:07:42,170 --> 02:07:46,609
them with each other eventually so we

2776
02:07:44,059 --> 02:07:49,038
can separate the whole pie exact heat

2777
02:07:46,609 --> 02:07:50,210
the pieces we need didn't cook off the

2778
02:07:49,038 --> 02:07:52,189
order I don't know if it's cooking off

2779
02:07:50,210 --> 02:07:54,618
bailing off dissipate may be the word

2780
02:07:52,189 --> 02:07:56,210
I'm looking for dissipate the gases and

2781
02:07:54,618 --> 02:07:59,750
other products who don't want filter out

2782
02:07:56,210 --> 02:08:03,500
contaminants and waxes will that bring

2783
02:07:59,750 --> 02:08:05,479
us to I see a cylinder a graduated

2784
02:08:03,500 --> 02:08:07,479
cylinder I think that's the word with

2785
02:08:05,479 --> 02:08:10,488
different layers of sediments in it

2786
02:08:07,479 --> 02:08:11,808
that'll show waxes eventually what I'm

2787
02:08:10,488 --> 02:08:12,828
headed for what I want to know the end

2788
02:08:11,809 --> 02:08:15,529
are we gonna be able to pull apart

2789
02:08:12,828 --> 02:08:17,118
pesticides like are we gonna say here's

2790
02:08:15,529 --> 02:08:18,800
all the pesticide that was found in your

2791
02:08:17,118 --> 02:08:20,868
plant is are we gonna get as the

2792
02:08:18,800 --> 02:08:23,260
research continues I bet we can I don't

2793
02:08:20,868 --> 02:08:26,448
see why not the guys it's you know

2794
02:08:23,260 --> 02:08:28,789
exactly has a site in a plant that was

2795
02:08:26,448 --> 02:08:31,279
treated while in early veg yeah I can

2796
02:08:28,788 --> 02:08:33,920
identify it in a dry DC and we're

2797
02:08:31,279 --> 02:08:37,340
already at that stage and also you got

2798
02:08:33,920 --> 02:08:40,069
to think about what some you're saying a

2799
02:08:37,340 --> 02:08:44,538
second ago there are any breeding plants

2800
02:08:40,069 --> 02:08:47,179
to be 15 to one CBD THC ratios are

2801
02:08:44,538 --> 02:08:52,519
already on that stage of separating

2802
02:08:47,179 --> 02:08:55,250
stuff in the plant stage and now the

2803
02:08:52,520 --> 02:08:58,280
dabbing concentrates in relative time

2804
02:08:55,250 --> 02:09:02,000
aspect is much newer than growing weed

2805
02:08:58,279 --> 02:09:03,979
right so we're very early in our

2806
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:05,469
research in our study with what can be

2807
02:09:03,979 --> 02:09:07,659
done and how it can be

2808
02:09:05,469 --> 02:09:10,359
and it's already moved very very very

2809
02:09:07,659 --> 02:09:12,010
quickly so I think as more people and

2810
02:09:10,359 --> 02:09:14,229
with the legalization more people like

2811
02:09:12,010 --> 02:09:16,630
PhDs in chemistry and things like that

2812
02:09:14,229 --> 02:09:19,179
that know a lot about the subjects come

2813
02:09:16,630 --> 02:09:23,199
into it that'll start to teach the whole

2814
02:09:19,180 --> 02:09:25,750
community about about all of it steep

2815
02:09:23,198 --> 02:09:26,469
hills a perfect example of that perfect

2816
02:09:25,750 --> 02:09:28,719
example

2817
02:09:26,469 --> 02:09:30,159
those guys are crushing it one thing

2818
02:09:28,719 --> 02:09:33,810
that I mentioned on Facebook today on

2819
02:09:30,159 --> 02:09:33,809
somebody's post they were talking about

2820
02:09:35,189 --> 02:09:39,779
people don't forget about the other

2821
02:09:42,448 --> 02:09:47,409
weekend while I was off identify 60 of

2822
02:09:45,488 --> 02:09:48,789
them right now there have got to be a

2823
02:09:47,409 --> 02:09:49,539
lot more because we're discovering new

2824
02:09:48,789 --> 02:09:51,130
[ __ ] every day

2825
02:09:49,539 --> 02:09:54,250
so don't go ahead I'll let you know

2826
02:09:51,130 --> 02:09:56,770
while I was off coffin I was thinking

2827
02:09:54,250 --> 02:09:59,649
that what you were talking about Sanjay

2828
02:09:56,770 --> 02:10:01,180
Gupta was just talking about and his

2829
02:09:59,649 --> 02:10:02,889
last weed too special that he just

2830
02:10:01,180 --> 02:10:05,050
excuse me while I cough a little bit

2831
02:10:02,890 --> 02:10:07,619
more dabs are gonna do that to you Oh

2832
02:10:05,050 --> 02:10:09,820
dad's just ruined me for a minute

2833
02:10:07,619 --> 02:10:11,890
but what you two have been talking about

2834
02:10:09,819 --> 02:10:13,840
is the very forefront of something he

2835
02:10:11,890 --> 02:10:15,460
mentioned in his show called the

2836
02:10:13,840 --> 02:10:16,420
entourage effect or at least that's what

2837
02:10:15,460 --> 02:10:18,939
they're calling him now in medical

2838
02:10:16,420 --> 02:10:20,770
circles and what that is is the

2839
02:10:18,939 --> 02:10:22,929
different cannabinoids the 60 of them

2840
02:10:20,770 --> 02:10:26,140
that you were just talking about working

2841
02:10:22,930 --> 02:10:28,960
together to produce amazing medical

2842
02:10:26,140 --> 02:10:30,969
effects yes part of the hard sell in

2843
02:10:28,960 --> 02:10:32,890
medical marijuana is it so useful

2844
02:10:30,969 --> 02:10:34,960
treating so many different things so

2845
02:10:32,890 --> 02:10:36,219
when someone doesn't believe you from

2846
02:10:34,960 --> 02:10:39,159
the get-go when you tell them that it

2847
02:10:36,219 --> 02:10:40,930
helps cancer epilepsy aids you know the

2848
02:10:39,159 --> 02:10:43,930
list goes on and on they think you're

2849
02:10:40,930 --> 02:10:46,510
lying and it turns out that it's just

2850
02:10:43,930 --> 02:10:48,699
different combinations of these

2851
02:10:46,510 --> 02:10:52,270
different cannabinoids having amazing

2852
02:10:48,698 --> 02:10:53,889
effects all over the body right and you

2853
02:10:52,270 --> 02:10:56,080
two are on the forefront of that with

2854
02:10:53,890 --> 02:11:00,610
some of the work you're doing and it's

2855
02:10:56,079 --> 02:11:02,680
crazy that it's happening it places like

2856
02:11:00,609 --> 02:11:04,359
it's happening instead of research labs

2857
02:11:02,680 --> 02:11:05,860
and research laboratories across the

2858
02:11:04,359 --> 02:11:07,509
u.s. because of the law it's just silly

2859
02:11:05,859 --> 02:11:09,789
and I got to point out that I'm really

2860
02:11:07,510 --> 02:11:11,500
thankful and grateful I don't know I

2861
02:11:09,789 --> 02:11:12,850
don't want to point out whatever I've

2862
02:11:11,500 --> 02:11:14,770
been thankful to but whatever you

2863
02:11:12,850 --> 02:11:16,030
believe in I'm [ __ ] thankful to that

2864
02:11:14,770 --> 02:11:18,170
because I've got such a really cool

2865
02:11:16,029 --> 02:11:20,359
position where I get to grow a medical

2866
02:11:18,170 --> 02:11:21,980
cannabis product and both of these guys

2867
02:11:20,359 --> 02:11:23,779
sitting at my table I'm their caregiver

2868
02:11:21,979 --> 02:11:26,000
I'm their medical marijuana supplier and

2869
02:11:23,779 --> 02:11:27,500
caregiver I get to talk with my bro keV

2870
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:29,869
and see what hurts what doesn't feel

2871
02:11:27,500 --> 02:11:32,539
good and he says dude I really like this

2872
02:11:29,869 --> 02:11:36,920
strain that you grow it makes my X not X

2873
02:11:32,539 --> 02:11:38,390
and my smile go smile and for me and you

2874
02:11:36,920 --> 02:11:39,890
just smile like a [ __ ] Lee said that

2875
02:11:38,390 --> 02:11:42,230
but that face when you smoke the lid

2876
02:11:39,890 --> 02:11:44,989
that I grow to make you not feel like

2877
02:11:42,229 --> 02:11:46,549
[ __ ] that's golden to me bro yeah same

2878
02:11:44,988 --> 02:11:49,039
thing for you Mike I know you love my

2879
02:11:46,550 --> 02:11:50,420
grateful dog like its I was hurting when

2880
02:11:49,039 --> 02:11:51,260
I got here today it's been a rough week

2881
02:11:50,420 --> 02:11:54,140
at work

2882
02:11:51,260 --> 02:11:56,360
been hauling a lot of heavy things up a

2883
02:11:54,140 --> 02:11:58,550
lot of stairs and within half-an-hour

2884
02:11:56,359 --> 02:12:01,759
getting here I was pain free and that's

2885
02:11:58,550 --> 02:12:03,529
all due to the medicine you produce and

2886
02:12:01,760 --> 02:12:06,230
it just angers me when people say it's

2887
02:12:03,529 --> 02:12:09,349
not medicine I read that a dozen times

2888
02:12:06,229 --> 02:12:12,019
today or when I read about CBD only

2889
02:12:09,350 --> 02:12:13,940
legislation finally somebody's listening

2890
02:12:12,020 --> 02:12:15,710
but they're clearly not paying enough

2891
02:12:13,939 --> 02:12:19,219
attention to what's being said if

2892
02:12:15,710 --> 02:12:21,739
they're taking away CBD only legislation

2893
02:12:19,219 --> 02:12:23,750
is actually going to help anyone yeah

2894
02:12:21,738 --> 02:12:25,669
you respect the whole plant not just one

2895
02:12:23,750 --> 02:12:26,899
part they need the full profile of

2896
02:12:25,670 --> 02:12:28,850
everything that's what I try to explain

2897
02:12:26,899 --> 02:12:31,250
to any patients or customers I get in

2898
02:12:28,850 --> 02:12:32,840
the dispensary I work at now they that's

2899
02:12:31,250 --> 02:12:34,969
one thing I really try to push is that

2900
02:12:32,840 --> 02:12:36,350
this entire profile of this plant is

2901
02:12:34,969 --> 02:12:37,880
very important and that's why

2902
02:12:36,350 --> 02:12:39,739
concentrates really helps so much

2903
02:12:37,880 --> 02:12:41,900
because I can concentrate that profile

2904
02:12:39,738 --> 02:12:45,639
of that plant and it's about the whole

2905
02:12:41,899 --> 02:12:47,119
not just teeny pieces yeah definitely

2906
02:12:45,640 --> 02:12:49,550
definitely

2907
02:12:47,119 --> 02:12:51,289
all right well that kind of brings me to

2908
02:12:49,550 --> 02:12:52,810
another topic that I want to discuss I

2909
02:12:51,289 --> 02:12:55,369
did have something lined up for the show

2910
02:12:52,810 --> 02:12:57,170
the Colorado Department of Public Health

2911
02:12:55,369 --> 02:13:00,469
and Environment is actually attempting

2912
02:12:57,170 --> 02:13:04,149
to pass a bill to limit caregivers to

2913
02:13:00,469 --> 02:13:06,890
six plants per patient and a limit of

2914
02:13:04,149 --> 02:13:09,019
five patients per caregiver

2915
02:13:06,890 --> 02:13:10,640
which is gonna be a cap that I say that

2916
02:13:09,020 --> 02:13:13,489
right you give me a funny face no it's

2917
02:13:10,640 --> 02:13:17,480
my Mountain Dew bottle sounds crazy loud

2918
02:13:13,488 --> 02:13:19,649
no it does but no matter where I move it

2919
02:13:17,479 --> 02:13:22,529
so they're trying to make it to where a

2920
02:13:19,649 --> 02:13:24,118
caregiver with six patients or with five

2921
02:13:22,529 --> 02:13:25,349
patients and including yourself if

2922
02:13:24,118 --> 02:13:26,549
you're if you want to grow medicine for

2923
02:13:25,349 --> 02:13:28,230
yourself but they don't even allow a

2924
02:13:26,550 --> 02:13:29,670
number for that you're they want to make

2925
02:13:28,229 --> 02:13:34,488
it to where a private caregiver is

2926
02:13:29,670 --> 02:13:37,139
capped out at 30 plants total right now

2927
02:13:34,488 --> 02:13:38,638
right now you're able to go if you go to

2928
02:13:37,139 --> 02:13:40,409
the Medical Marijuana doctor and you pay

2929
02:13:38,639 --> 02:13:43,460
your regular fee the doctor should see

2930
02:13:40,408 --> 02:13:45,839
you examine you and write you your

2931
02:13:43,460 --> 02:13:48,000
recommendation and that comes with a

2932
02:13:45,840 --> 02:13:49,380
standardized count of six plants and you

2933
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:51,149
can have three of those plants in flower

2934
02:13:49,380 --> 02:13:53,489
and three of those plants in the veg

2935
02:13:51,149 --> 02:13:54,839
stage which means some are budding and

2936
02:13:53,488 --> 02:13:56,939
some are not if that you gotta read your

2937
02:13:54,840 --> 02:13:58,710
own book to get that far with me right -

2938
02:13:56,939 --> 02:14:01,289
even get to what we're talking about now

2939
02:13:58,710 --> 02:14:02,819
there's a whole lot of history well I'm

2940
02:14:01,289 --> 02:14:04,889
gonna try to catch up acting it like

2941
02:14:02,819 --> 02:14:06,809
there are a lot of people who made crazy

2942
02:14:04,889 --> 02:14:09,960
decisions to get us here but this is

2943
02:14:06,810 --> 02:14:11,489
what legislators decided right and I

2944
02:14:09,960 --> 02:14:13,170
have a nice little article written by a

2945
02:14:11,488 --> 02:14:14,729
friend of mine who's very well written

2946
02:14:13,170 --> 02:14:16,800
and I'll read I'm gonna read through it

2947
02:14:14,729 --> 02:14:19,019
and try to do the best I can but what

2948
02:14:16,800 --> 02:14:21,480
I'm I want to give people an update on

2949
02:14:19,020 --> 02:14:26,250

2950
02:14:21,479 --> 02:14:28,589
your card if you are I'm gonna use your

2951
02:14:26,250 --> 02:14:30,118

2952
02:14:28,590 --> 02:14:32,069
a little more medicine than some people

2953
02:14:30,118 --> 02:14:34,259
cuz he's got a condition that we need to

2954
02:14:32,069 --> 02:14:35,939
supply him with yeah and he the doctor

2955
02:14:34,260 --> 02:14:37,560
knows that because he's met with the

2956
02:14:35,939 --> 02:14:39,269
doctor and the doctor said holy [ __ ]

2957

medicine

2962
02:14:46,408 --> 02:14:50,908
okay here's that many plants they send

2963
02:14:48,210 --> 02:14:52,710
it into the registry he's legit his

2964
02:14:50,908 --> 02:14:55,109
caregiver has set up a grow to supply

2965
02:14:52,710 --> 02:14:56,908
that much medicine for him and he's also

2966
02:14:55,109 --> 02:14:58,738
got that caregiver also has more

2967
02:14:56,908 --> 02:15:00,269
patients that he's responsible for so

2968
02:14:58,738 --> 02:15:02,279
he's got a certain amount of people he's

2969
02:15:00,270 --> 02:15:04,800
responsible for taking care of he's

2970
02:15:02,279 --> 02:15:06,210
gonna grow this many plants produce this

2971
02:15:04,800 --> 02:15:07,650
many once's a weed for this many people

2972
02:15:06,210 --> 02:15:11,760
we've got a thought of people are taking

2973
02:15:07,649 --> 02:15:14,698
care of now they want to chop that down

2974
02:15:11,760 --> 02:15:16,500
to only 30 plants and now people are

2975
02:15:14,698 --> 02:15:19,738
gonna run out of medicine early because

2976
02:15:16,500 --> 02:15:21,300
if I'm not able you guys I've got I've

2977
02:15:19,738 --> 02:15:24,029
got five patients that I'm responsible

2978
02:15:21,300 --> 02:15:25,529
for plus myself and I I know how to grow

2979
02:15:24,029 --> 02:15:28,380
I know how to pull weight off of a plant

2980
02:15:25,529 --> 02:15:29,539
and these guys can smoke some weed it

2981
02:15:28,380 --> 02:15:32,039
was

2982
02:15:29,539 --> 02:15:33,359
mildly between the raw flowers that we

2983
02:15:32,039 --> 02:15:34,739
smoked flowers is the buds for the

2984
02:15:33,359 --> 02:15:36,029
people that aren't in the industry or

2985
02:15:34,739 --> 02:15:38,010
aren't caught up on terms when we say

2986
02:15:36,029 --> 02:15:39,359
flower we just mean buds driving to your

2987
02:15:38,010 --> 02:15:41,699
manicured buds

2988
02:15:39,359 --> 02:15:44,399
that's flowers concentrates I'm usually

2989
02:15:41,699 --> 02:15:46,409
talking about some pho some dabs between

2990
02:15:44,399 --> 02:15:49,469
the flowers and the dabs and the edibles

2991
02:15:46,409 --> 02:15:51,750
that these guys require I need to grow

2992
02:15:49,470 --> 02:15:53,789
more than what I'm actually I'm not

2993
02:15:51,750 --> 02:15:55,199
doing it but I could use more plants I

2994
02:15:53,789 --> 02:15:56,840
could definitely use an increase in your

2995
02:15:55,199 --> 02:15:59,519
guyses numbers because you guys like to

2996
02:15:56,840 --> 02:16:01,680
medicate heavily well in this you have

2997
02:15:59,520 --> 02:16:04,920
to get into to some of the requirements

2998
02:16:01,680 --> 02:16:08,159
for actually growing quality medical

2999
02:16:04,920 --> 02:16:10,859
marijuana here like six marijuana plants

3000
02:16:08,159 --> 02:16:12,779
sounds like a lot of marijuana plants 30

3001
02:16:10,859 --> 02:16:15,000
marijuana plants sounds like a whole lot

3002
02:16:12,779 --> 02:16:17,210
of marijuana plants earlier you guys

3003
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:19,229
were talking about phenotypes

3004
02:16:17,210 --> 02:16:22,739
everybody's talking about different

3005
02:16:19,229 --> 02:16:24,839
strains when you're capped at 30 and

3006
02:16:22,739 --> 02:16:28,079
you're trying to supply five different

3007
02:16:24,840 --> 02:16:29,970
people all of a sudden you're incredibly

3008
02:16:28,079 --> 02:16:33,329
limited into what you can do what you

3009
02:16:29,970 --> 02:16:35,670
can work with and we wouldn't have CBD

3010
02:16:33,329 --> 02:16:38,280
only sprains or Charlotte's Web or any

3011
02:16:35,670 --> 02:16:40,229
of that without a dispensary system that

3012
02:16:38,280 --> 02:16:42,870
was allowed to grow thousands of plants

3013
02:16:40,229 --> 02:16:47,369
right and trying to care give you almost

3014
02:16:42,870 --> 02:16:50,400
have to do I mean hundreds of plants

3015
02:16:47,370 --> 02:16:51,770
over a couple of years to really get

3016
02:16:50,399 --> 02:16:53,729
your patients figured out there's a

3017
02:16:51,770 --> 02:16:58,290
there's something else I wanted to get

3018
02:16:53,729 --> 02:17:00,119
in 30 at a time is just crazy I like to

3019
02:16:58,290 --> 02:17:02,550
grow big plants I like a seven gallon

3020
02:17:00,120 --> 02:17:04,320
pot fold with the soilless mix a lot of

3021
02:17:02,549 --> 02:17:05,879
perlite in there a lot of I'm not even

3022
02:17:04,319 --> 02:17:08,309
gonna tell you so much of it but I like

3023
02:17:05,879 --> 02:17:09,779
a nice seven gallon pot I like to veg

3024
02:17:08,309 --> 02:17:11,789
them until they're about three feet tall

3025
02:17:09,780 --> 02:17:13,739
three and a half feet tall and I like to

3026
02:17:11,790 --> 02:17:15,540
flower them at that point I'll top them

3027
02:17:13,739 --> 02:17:16,799
one store they're nice Bush and by the

3028
02:17:15,540 --> 02:17:19,380
time they're done they're about six feet

3029
02:17:16,799 --> 02:17:20,759
tall I like to draw a big plant but if I

3030
02:17:19,379 --> 02:17:23,159
grow my super silver means that I've got

3031
02:17:20,760 --> 02:17:25,200
in a pot that size oh excuse me I'm

3032
02:17:23,159 --> 02:17:26,549
burping if I grow a super Silver Haze

3033
02:17:25,200 --> 02:17:28,469
strain that I have in a pot that size

3034
02:17:26,549 --> 02:17:29,699
it'll grow through the frickin ceiling

3035
02:17:28,468 --> 02:17:32,879
in the eleven weeks that it takes to

3036
02:17:29,700 --> 02:17:35,340
finish so I run more of those plants in

3037
02:17:32,879 --> 02:17:37,019
smaller pots because it's more as a

3038
02:17:35,340 --> 02:17:39,000
grower that's experienced I know that's

3039
02:17:37,020 --> 02:17:42,200
the most economical and efficient way to

3040
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:45,530
run with that strain so I have to

3041
02:17:42,200 --> 02:17:47,300
not run I have to time it because if I

3042
02:17:45,530 --> 02:17:48,829
have to count I have so many numbers I

3043
02:17:47,299 --> 02:17:50,359
can play with and if I want to do super

3044
02:17:48,829 --> 02:17:53,058
Silver Haze for my guy that wants a

3045
02:17:50,360 --> 02:17:55,069
straight up head race and sativa I've

3046
02:17:53,058 --> 02:17:56,840
got a plan nine of those instead of four

3047
02:17:55,069 --> 02:17:59,599
and that just messes up my plant count

3048
02:17:56,840 --> 02:18:01,340
already just for strain adjustment so

3049
02:17:59,599 --> 02:18:02,719
that's changing our numbers is kind of

3050
02:18:01,340 --> 02:18:04,159
it's gonna mess with us and they're

3051
02:18:02,718 --> 02:18:06,500
trying to stop us from being a lucrative

3052
02:18:04,159 --> 02:18:09,709
enterprise and right now being a

3053
02:18:06,500 --> 02:18:11,929
caregiver it nearly cost me money

3054
02:18:09,709 --> 02:18:13,909
to be a medical marijuana care guy I

3055
02:18:11,929 --> 02:18:15,769
don't make any money doing it certainly

3056
02:18:13,909 --> 02:18:17,750
there are light bills I work I spend a

3057
02:18:15,769 --> 02:18:20,059
lot of time putting your guys's medicine

3058
02:18:17,750 --> 02:18:21,888
together right it's it's not easy if I

3059
02:18:20,058 --> 02:18:25,579
would say I was to order something that

3060
02:18:21,888 --> 02:18:28,699
was I don't know fifty percent THC 50%

3061
02:18:25,579 --> 02:18:31,489
CBD or whatever the profile is how long

3062
02:18:28,700 --> 02:18:33,380
from me going I want this to you being

3063
02:18:31,489 --> 02:18:34,968
able to produce it do I have the strain

3064
02:18:33,379 --> 02:18:37,098
that you want or do I need to create

3065
02:18:34,968 --> 02:18:38,688
that flow I just showed up and I'm a

3066
02:18:37,099 --> 02:18:41,450
journal I've never mentioned it before

3067
02:18:38,689 --> 02:18:44,689
and I want it now breeding a strain is

3068
02:18:41,450 --> 02:18:46,400
gonna take me at least well to breed it

3069
02:18:44,689 --> 02:18:47,960
the first time I gotta get the mail I

3070
02:18:46,399 --> 02:18:49,218
gotta get the female if I've got the

3071
02:18:47,959 --> 02:18:50,629
male and female that you're helping I

3072
02:18:49,218 --> 02:18:53,029
you know I have to have the male and

3073
02:18:50,629 --> 02:18:55,459
female and I have to get them both veg

3074
02:18:53,030 --> 02:18:56,840
big enough I have to flour them out veg

3075
02:18:55,459 --> 02:18:58,938
stage is probably two months flower

3076
02:18:56,840 --> 02:19:00,380
stage is definitely two months maybe two

3077
02:18:58,939 --> 02:19:03,439
and a half to three depending because

3078
02:19:00,379 --> 02:19:05,329
you've got five months already I'm gonna

3079
02:19:03,439 --> 02:19:06,290
kick out seeds plants got a dry it'll

3080
02:19:05,329 --> 02:19:08,718
pull the seeds out you're looking

3081
02:19:06,290 --> 02:19:10,729
another couple few weeks there we're

3082
02:19:08,718 --> 02:19:13,089
happy you're just making the first batch

3083
02:19:10,728 --> 02:19:15,409
of seeds now we have to run those and

3084
02:19:13,090 --> 02:19:17,058
share those with other providers that

3085
02:19:15,409 --> 02:19:18,530
can take a clone of that so that if they

3086
02:19:17,058 --> 02:19:21,018
find the champion that you're looking

3087
02:19:18,530 --> 02:19:22,820
for then I can get a clone of that and

3088
02:19:21,019 --> 02:19:24,889
then I need to breed that one to either

3089
02:19:22,819 --> 02:19:28,010
the male or the female again but the

3090
02:19:24,888 --> 02:19:29,629
male again to stabilize it and then so

3091
02:19:28,010 --> 02:19:30,769
we're like you're two now right yeah

3092
02:19:29,629 --> 02:19:32,179
it's gonna take us a little while we'll

3093
02:19:30,769 --> 02:19:33,679
have what you need at first but if I

3094
02:19:32,179 --> 02:19:34,879
want to get it in seed form that's solid

3095
02:19:33,679 --> 02:19:36,558
for it to be out and available we're

3096
02:19:34,879 --> 02:19:39,289
looking at two maybe three years right

3097
02:19:36,558 --> 02:19:41,179
it'll be available to sample here and

3098
02:19:39,290 --> 02:19:43,760
there but before it can be something

3099
02:19:41,179 --> 02:19:45,228
that you could keep available study form

3100
02:19:43,760 --> 02:19:48,680
and we're looking at three years yeah

3101
02:19:45,228 --> 02:19:51,228
yeah that's what the rules though they

3102
02:19:48,680 --> 02:19:53,389
are now if if all of a sudden every

3103
02:19:51,228 --> 02:19:59,209
caregiver in Colorado is limited to 30

3104
02:19:53,389 --> 02:20:01,099
but are 30 or 36 plants are limited

3105
02:19:59,209 --> 02:20:02,929
people period if you're working in

3106
02:20:01,100 --> 02:20:03,770
Denver city and county you're limited to

3107
02:20:02,930 --> 02:20:06,800
12 pant

3108
02:20:03,770 --> 02:20:08,140
plants per household period no

3109
02:20:06,799 --> 02:20:10,489
exceptions

3110
02:20:08,139 --> 02:20:12,680
how many mother plants do some genetic

3111
02:20:10,489 --> 02:20:15,260
companies have right hundreds

3112
02:20:12,680 --> 02:20:16,760
Wow I know the archive I can't quote but

3113
02:20:15,260 --> 02:20:18,380
I'm pretty sure archive has about

3114
02:20:16,760 --> 02:20:20,030
eighteen to twenty five mother plants

3115
02:20:18,379 --> 02:20:23,478
archive seed bank I would be way off

3116
02:20:20,030 --> 02:20:26,510
then yeah I think sub cool probably has

3117
02:20:23,478 --> 02:20:29,090
got 40 I was thinkin strains know mother

3118
02:20:26,510 --> 02:20:31,939
mother plays like one seed company like

3119
02:20:29,090 --> 02:20:33,860
one seed guy in the and the big guys

3120
02:20:31,939 --> 02:20:35,420
like swerves probably got I'm just

3121
02:20:33,860 --> 02:20:37,189
dropping names now swears probably got

3122
02:20:35,420 --> 02:20:39,799
thirty five mother plants that he works

3123
02:20:37,189 --> 02:20:42,139
with yeah and two males and he reverses

3124
02:20:39,799 --> 02:20:44,420
[ __ ] and so that's you'd have to keep

3125
02:20:42,139 --> 02:20:47,989
thirty five females just to have those

3126
02:20:44,420 --> 02:20:49,370
four genetic supply like with that it's

3127
02:20:47,989 --> 02:20:50,719
gonna off the that's stretching it

3128
02:20:49,370 --> 02:20:52,790
though a little bit this is where all

3129
02:20:50,719 --> 02:20:54,559
those crazy names come from is all the

3130
02:20:52,790 --> 02:20:57,470
work a hard work that these people are

3131
02:20:54,559 --> 02:20:59,510
that we're describing right now I'm

3132
02:20:57,469 --> 02:21:01,309
gonna read the summary of a caregiver

3133
02:20:59,510 --> 02:21:03,050
bill that's written by my friend Kevin

3134
02:21:01,309 --> 02:21:04,728
hey Kevin I apologize it's not the Kevin

3135
02:21:03,049 --> 02:21:06,170
at the table it's another Kevin I don't

3136
02:21:04,728 --> 02:21:07,309
know how to pronounce your last name and

3137
02:21:06,170 --> 02:21:08,870
I feel it'd be more polite just to

3138
02:21:07,309 --> 02:21:10,250
straight up say I don't know how to

3139
02:21:08,870 --> 02:21:11,689
pronounce that I'd like to meet you in

3140
02:21:10,250 --> 02:21:13,700
person shake your hand and have you tell

3141
02:21:11,689 --> 02:21:15,409
me how to say this Kevin is the

3142
02:21:13,700 --> 02:21:17,930
political director for pink house blooms

3143
02:21:15,409 --> 02:21:20,569
he's a very educated and well-written

3144
02:21:17,930 --> 02:21:21,950
well-spoken young man here's what he has

3145
02:21:20,569 --> 02:21:24,020
to say I'm reading from my iphone so

3146
02:21:21,950 --> 02:21:27,079
excuse me when I have to refine my spot

3147
02:21:24,020 --> 02:21:29,030
several times the current debate focused

3148
02:21:27,079 --> 02:21:31,280
around Colorado's marijuana caregivers

3149
02:21:29,030 --> 02:21:33,470
is a result of recent of a recent audit

3150
02:21:31,280 --> 02:21:34,700
of the caregiver program by the Colorado

3151
02:21:33,469 --> 02:21:36,109
Department of Public Health and

3152
02:21:34,700 --> 02:21:38,000
Environment and the Department of

3153
02:21:36,110 --> 02:21:39,710
Revenue he had the Department of Revenue

3154
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:43,420
is attached to our marijuana system in

3155
02:21:39,709 --> 02:21:45,199
Colorado they do keep very good notes

3156
02:21:43,420 --> 02:21:46,700
throughout the process there were

3157
02:21:45,200 --> 02:21:49,040
several shortcomings in regard to the

3158
02:21:46,700 --> 02:21:50,689
enforceability of the program and the

3159
02:21:49,040 --> 02:21:52,370
overall implementation auditors

3160
02:21:50,689 --> 02:21:54,110
discovered regulars were not

3161
02:21:52,370 --> 02:21:55,700
sufficiently overseeing doctors who

3162
02:21:54,110 --> 02:21:57,260
issue recommendations to patients

3163
02:21:55,700 --> 02:21:59,350
caregivers were not given proper

3164
02:21:57,260 --> 02:22:01,728
oversight fer from the Health Department

3165
02:21:59,350 --> 02:22:03,350
officials failed to issue red cards

3166
02:22:01,728 --> 02:22:05,989
within the constitutionally required

3167
02:22:03,350 --> 02:22:08,420
35-day timeline which has been a problem

3168
02:22:05,989 --> 02:22:09,920
day one right there they'd never had

3169
02:22:08,420 --> 02:22:11,829
that right how's that the caregivers

3170
02:22:09,920 --> 02:22:14,329
fault

3171
02:22:11,829 --> 02:22:15,709
this is what sparked it all they honored

3172
02:22:14,329 --> 02:22:17,209
it because of this and then they

3173
02:22:15,709 --> 02:22:19,669
realized all the stuff that's going on

3174
02:22:17,209 --> 02:22:22,430
and I agree with part of it and we'll

3175
02:22:19,670 --> 02:22:23,510
get on to I understand why but so

3176
02:22:22,431 --> 02:22:26,120
they're not getting the cards in the

3177
02:22:23,510 --> 02:22:27,530
required time and also accused the

3178
02:22:26,120 --> 02:22:29,601
Health Department of charging too much

3179
02:22:27,530 --> 02:22:31,340
in patient application fees which they

3180
02:22:29,601 --> 02:22:33,440
have reduced to fifteen dollars it

3181
02:22:31,340 --> 02:22:35,030
started off at ninety and down to thirty

3182
02:22:33,440 --> 02:22:36,920
five they did something for indigent

3183
02:22:35,030 --> 02:22:38,750
people and now it's fifteen bucks

3184
02:22:36,920 --> 02:22:41,810
they've gotten an overage in their

3185
02:22:38,750 --> 02:22:43,579
account of like 10 or 13 million or

3186
02:22:41,810 --> 02:22:46,250
something like that in state law forbids

3187
02:22:43,579 --> 02:22:48,140
things like that so they've had to drop

3188
02:22:46,250 --> 02:22:50,149
that fee over and over and over again

3189
02:22:48,140 --> 02:22:52,520
because they can't take in any more

3190
02:22:50,149 --> 02:22:53,899
money legally huh until they spend all

3191
02:22:52,521 --> 02:22:56,450
the money they've already shaved out of

3192
02:22:53,899 --> 02:22:58,879
the medical marijuana program it's kind

3193
02:22:56,450 --> 02:23:01,760
of Handy it's a nice little provision if

3194
02:22:58,879 --> 02:23:03,439
you're a taxpayer for sure or car red

3195
02:23:01,760 --> 02:23:05,239
card holder I like that the fee got

3196
02:23:03,440 --> 02:23:11,300
cheap oh yeah at the fee got cheaper I

3197
02:23:05,239 --> 02:23:12,949
definitely appreciate that the

3198
02:23:11,299 --> 02:23:16,399
Department of Public Health and these

3199
02:23:12,950 --> 02:23:17,360
guys are plotting why in the studio the

3200
02:23:16,399 --> 02:23:18,979
Department of Public Health and

3201
02:23:17,360 --> 02:23:20,329
Environment generally agreed with the

3202
02:23:18,979 --> 02:23:22,520
recommendations from the auditor's

3203
02:23:20,329 --> 02:23:24,079
report and are already taking steps to

3204
02:23:22,521 --> 02:23:26,360
rectify the issues they're considering

3205
02:23:24,079 --> 02:23:28,459
redefining who is an authorized CD Phe

3206
02:23:26,360 --> 02:23:30,409
employee which could mean increased

3207
02:23:28,459 --> 02:23:31,819
access to private medical record medical

3208
02:23:30,409 --> 02:23:33,200
marijuana records by independent

3209
02:23:31,819 --> 02:23:35,659
contractors limiting the number of

3210
02:23:33,200 --> 02:23:37,880
patients that private medical marijuana

3211
02:23:35,659 --> 02:23:39,739
caregivers can serve as well as putting

3212
02:23:37,879 --> 02:23:41,119
a cap on the number of plants an

3213
02:23:39,739 --> 02:23:41,959
individual may grow did that make sense

3214
02:23:41,120 --> 02:23:50,990
do you guys I felt like I might have

3215
02:23:41,959 --> 02:23:53,060
skipped something yeah so they wanted

3216
02:23:50,989 --> 02:23:55,159
theirs the sentence they should have

3217
02:23:53,060 --> 02:23:56,449
caught limiting the number of patients

3218
02:23:55,159 --> 02:23:58,310
that private medical marijuana

3219
02:23:56,450 --> 02:23:59,630
caregivers can have as well as putting a

3220
02:23:58,310 --> 02:24:01,569
cap on the number of plants an

3221
02:23:59,629 --> 02:24:04,339
individual may grow

3222
02:24:01,569 --> 02:24:05,840
reiterating what I was saying it's gonna

3223
02:24:04,340 --> 02:24:09,409
[ __ ] things up so I'm gonna continue

3224
02:24:05,840 --> 02:24:10,880
doctor Larry won't walk WOL Kay of the

3225
02:24:09,409 --> 02:24:13,250
Colorado Department Public Health I'm

3226
02:24:10,879 --> 02:24:15,619
gonna see CD Phe from now on to save us

3227
02:24:13,250 --> 02:24:18,469
all a headache so let me walk with the

3228
02:24:15,620 --> 02:24:20,180
CD Phe along with the state legislators

3229
02:24:18,469 --> 02:24:21,679
working to craft new laws clarifying

3230
02:24:20,180 --> 02:24:25,488
their stance on caregivers and home

3231
02:24:21,680 --> 02:24:28,340
growers but House Speaker mark F who

3232
02:24:25,488 --> 02:24:30,260
does not good with these names that are

3233
02:24:28,340 --> 02:24:31,939
not English completely so mark I'm not

3234
02:24:30,260 --> 02:24:33,318
gonna [ __ ] up your name I have respect

3235
02:24:31,939 --> 02:24:35,300
for that mark who decides which bills

3236
02:24:33,318 --> 02:24:36,648
can be considered said he won't allow a

3237
02:24:35,299 --> 02:24:38,478
vote on the issue until medical

3238
02:24:36,648 --> 02:24:41,209
marijuana caregivers and patients are

3239
02:24:38,478 --> 02:24:42,738
consulted maybe they're gonna kind of

3240
02:24:41,209 --> 02:24:45,019
try to listen to us and we've already

3241
02:24:42,738 --> 02:24:46,969
raised a stink one public hearing

3242
02:24:45,020 --> 02:24:49,729
already and I know that a number of

3243
02:24:46,969 --> 02:24:51,858
caregivers stood up and spoke I know

3244
02:24:49,728 --> 02:24:53,719
that a couple failed to put their best

3245
02:24:51,859 --> 02:24:56,329
foot forward which was unfortunate but

3246
02:24:53,719 --> 02:24:59,000
for the most part they they went and

3247
02:24:56,329 --> 02:25:01,250
they said our piece and try to explain

3248
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:03,228
to the legislature why limiting people

3249
02:25:01,250 --> 02:25:06,500
in this way is a terrible idea

3250
02:25:03,228 --> 02:25:09,188
any time government is between a patient

3251
02:25:06,500 --> 02:25:11,689
and a doctor bad things tend to happen

3252
02:25:09,189 --> 02:25:12,829
and that's totally what's going on here

3253
02:25:11,689 --> 02:25:15,050
they want to tell you what your

3254
02:25:12,829 --> 02:25:16,639
prescription should be and because in

3255
02:25:15,049 --> 02:25:18,590
Colorado we're not allowed to have

3256
02:25:16,639 --> 02:25:20,238
prescriptions for medical marijuana we

3257
02:25:18,590 --> 02:25:22,909
have to have a recommendation and all

3258
02:25:20,238 --> 02:25:25,039
sorts of other things the legislature

3259
02:25:22,909 --> 02:25:28,670
just realized that doctors haven't been

3260
02:25:25,040 --> 02:25:30,080
giving out the minimum per for everybody

3261
02:25:28,670 --> 02:25:32,568
that they're for the hundred and ten

3262
02:25:30,079 --> 02:25:33,829
thousand people in the program doctors

3263
02:25:32,568 --> 02:25:35,930
have actually been talking to the

3264
02:25:33,829 --> 02:25:38,889
patients asking them how much they

3265
02:25:35,930 --> 02:25:41,000
consume how often in writing them a

3266
02:25:38,889 --> 02:25:44,930
recommendation that's appropriate to

3267
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:46,909
that and they freaked out now there are

3268
02:25:44,930 --> 02:25:49,100
one or two examples that they cite that

3269
02:25:46,909 --> 02:25:52,270
are pretty egregious I'd admit the dude

3270
02:25:49,100 --> 02:25:55,579
with a hundred what 501 plan count

3271
02:25:52,270 --> 02:25:57,050
that's yes since federal limits up but

3272
02:25:55,579 --> 02:25:59,719
they're fed any federal plants is

3273
02:25:57,049 --> 02:26:02,599
illegal federally but they but they say

3274
02:25:59,719 --> 02:26:05,028
they don't care if it's 99 right do if

3275
02:26:02,600 --> 02:26:06,380
it's a hundred and one dude with a five

3276
02:26:05,029 --> 02:26:08,060
hundred plan account card that's a lot

3277
02:26:06,379 --> 02:26:09,199
of plants yeah well that's cool because

3278
02:26:08,059 --> 02:26:10,398
that's like the guy when you're on the

3279
02:26:09,200 --> 02:26:12,079
highway and there's that one guy in the

3280
02:26:10,398 --> 02:26:14,090
yellow Camaro that goes haulin ass past

3281
02:26:12,079 --> 02:26:15,139
you then you go enjoy that ticket and

3282
02:26:14,090 --> 02:26:16,939
you know you could just drive right by

3283
02:26:15,139 --> 02:26:18,528
the cop cuz he's getting he's [ __ ]

3284
02:26:16,939 --> 02:26:19,850
with that other guy already we'll just

3285
02:26:18,529 --> 02:26:21,738
let that guy with the 500 plants per

3286
02:26:19,850 --> 02:26:23,899
race right by us there's only 24

3287
02:26:21,738 --> 02:26:26,920
caregivers in the whole state I think it

3288
02:26:23,898 --> 02:26:30,108
said that have more than five patients

3289
02:26:26,920 --> 02:26:32,030
so they're they're making a huge stink

3290
02:26:30,109 --> 02:26:35,329
out of a pretty small problem for the

3291
02:26:32,030 --> 02:26:36,409
this part um you know I mean yeah well

3292
02:26:35,329 --> 02:26:38,601
they're here to change the rules for

3293
02:26:36,409 --> 02:26:41,030
everybody and screw up 12 years of good

3294
02:26:38,601 --> 02:26:41,870
practice we'll get in we're gonna talk

3295
02:26:41,030 --> 02:26:43,641
about that in a minute here because

3296
02:26:41,870 --> 02:26:45,920
that's I'm jumping ahead well no that's

3297
02:26:43,640 --> 02:26:47,569
just the the part I want to rant about

3298
02:26:45,920 --> 02:26:48,950
that's the result and we're gonna save

3299
02:26:47,569 --> 02:26:50,029
the result after we read you know you

3300
02:26:48,950 --> 02:26:52,490
got to do all the math and the moles

3301
02:26:50,030 --> 02:26:54,250
summarize the results so I'm gonna read

3302
02:26:52,489 --> 02:26:56,810
a little more there's one good paragraph

3303
02:26:54,250 --> 02:26:57,950
the caregiver issue has the men the

3304
02:26:56,810 --> 02:27:00,379
marijuana community split down the

3305
02:26:57,950 --> 02:27:02,329
middle the industry mm IG and CB air

3306
02:27:00,379 --> 02:27:03,770
both supporting the CDP a cheese efforts

3307
02:27:02,329 --> 02:27:05,899
while patients and patient advocacy

3308
02:27:03,771 --> 02:27:07,909
groups the patient advocacy groups

3309
02:27:05,899 --> 02:27:09,979
patients out of time Colorado Springs

3310
02:27:07,909 --> 02:27:11,601
Medical Marijuana Council Coloradans for

3311
02:27:09,979 --> 02:27:14,600
cannabis patients rights and green faith

3312
02:27:11,601 --> 02:27:16,670
ministries make up the opposition many

3313
02:27:14,601 --> 02:27:18,620
believe that groups such as mmm IG and

3314
02:27:16,670 --> 02:27:20,511
CBA are only supportive of tighter

3315
02:27:18,620 --> 02:27:22,070
regulations because and this is what I'm

3316
02:27:20,511 --> 02:27:24,530
thinking it will force patients into the

3317
02:27:22,069 --> 02:27:26,869
regulated market and in return increase

3318
02:27:24,530 --> 02:27:28,880
profits those that are opposing efforts

3319
02:27:26,870 --> 02:27:31,300
cited doctor-patient relationships

3320
02:27:28,879 --> 02:27:35,149
privacy and compassion as areas of

3321
02:27:31,299 --> 02:27:37,520
concern so what I think is gonna happen

3322
02:27:35,149 --> 02:27:39,590
here if they will limit my number of

3323
02:27:37,521 --> 02:27:44,960
plants all caregivers not just myself

3324
02:27:39,590 --> 02:27:46,579
they'll cut us down and it's gonna make

3325
02:27:44,959 --> 02:27:50,899
a short supply because there's already a

3326
02:27:46,579 --> 02:27:53,899
short supply supply in Colorado is bent

3327
02:27:50,899 --> 02:27:56,539
it was tight before Weimer is mine do

3328
02:27:53,899 --> 02:27:57,709
you ever go anywhere else to get your

3329
02:27:56,540 --> 02:27:59,960
medical marijuana other than your

3330
02:27:57,709 --> 02:28:05,589

3331
02:27:59,959 --> 02:28:07,850
town right how about you can't eat well

3332

02:28:23,931 --> 02:28:32,390
I don't listen like in Denver as you

the Tora Bora like a boss and I do not

3350
02:28:51,620 --> 02:28:55,521
like growing the plant personally as a

3351
02:28:53,540 --> 02:28:57,831
grower as a cannabis photographer I

3352
02:28:55,521 --> 02:28:59,811
don't like growing Tora Bora it doesn't

3353
02:28:57,831 --> 02:29:01,399
grow well for my growing style my

3354
02:28:59,810 --> 02:29:02,720
environment doesn't get along with the

3355
02:29:01,399 --> 02:29:05,119
rest of my plants it doesn't play the

3356
02:29:02,720 --> 02:29:11,569
same but these guys love the majority of

3357
02:29:05,120 --> 02:29:14,021
his patients love it half as much as all

3358
02:29:11,569 --> 02:29:15,770
of my heavy hitters

3359
02:29:14,021 --> 02:29:19,671
which is really awesome

3360
02:29:15,771 --> 02:29:23,110
he really gets our opinion takes it to

3361
02:29:19,671 --> 02:29:25,791
heart and runs with it you know it's

3362
02:29:23,110 --> 02:29:29,001
like like I've said before that my joy

3363
02:29:25,790 --> 02:29:31,520
is watching people feel better I've got

3364
02:29:29,001 --> 02:29:33,140
a friend who he's got a bad back he's

3365
02:29:31,521 --> 02:29:34,881
got some sciatica his legs are [ __ ] up

3366
02:29:33,140 --> 02:29:38,119
he walks with a cane he showed up here

3367
02:29:34,880 --> 02:29:39,739
in pain and we all hung out and I got

3368
02:29:38,120 --> 02:29:41,331
him nice and heavily medicated and he

3369
02:29:39,739 --> 02:29:44,210
stood up to leave and the old bastard

3370
02:29:41,331 --> 02:29:46,370
forgot his cane that's how I felt that's

3371
02:29:44,210 --> 02:29:50,119
how good the man felt that statement in

3372
02:29:46,370 --> 02:29:52,431
itself is huge forgot his cane I got two

3373
02:29:50,120 --> 02:29:53,841
I made that happen like I'm not trying

3374
02:29:52,431 --> 02:29:56,271
to say but I mean the feeling inside me

3375
02:29:53,841 --> 02:29:57,711
was like wow he's walking upright he

3376
02:29:56,271 --> 02:29:59,211
forgot he hurts yet a little bit of

3377
02:29:57,710 --> 02:30:01,279
spiritual therapy from hanging out with

3378
02:29:59,210 --> 02:30:03,649
all of us for an hour or whatever that

3379
02:30:01,280 --> 02:30:06,021
kind of stuff is priceless so when they

3380
02:30:03,649 --> 02:30:07,251
limit might grow or other caregivers

3381
02:30:06,021 --> 02:30:08,721
because mine they're not really gonna

3382
02:30:07,251 --> 02:30:10,310
this isn't gonna hurt me too much

3383
02:30:08,720 --> 02:30:12,109
honestly my problem is that I've got

3384
02:30:10,310 --> 02:30:13,761
mother plants and I'm gonna have to like

3385
02:30:12,110 --> 02:30:15,891
minimize mother plants to make this work

3386
02:30:13,761 --> 02:30:17,360
or something else but I can adjust I can

3387
02:30:15,890 --> 02:30:18,619
roll with punches I'm that's what a

3388
02:30:17,360 --> 02:30:21,021
grower does that's what a breeder does

3389
02:30:18,620 --> 02:30:22,700
you [ __ ] adapt to just [ __ ] move on

3390
02:30:21,021 --> 02:30:25,070
but they're gonna be people that cannot

3391
02:30:22,700 --> 02:30:26,990
do that are not as skilled they're not

3392
02:30:25,069 --> 02:30:28,310
as educated they aren't as experienced

3393
02:30:26,989 --> 02:30:30,140
they're not gonna be able to keep up

3394
02:30:28,310 --> 02:30:31,940
their supply for their patients what's

3395
02:30:30,140 --> 02:30:34,699
gonna happen is these people are gonna

3396
02:30:31,940 --> 02:30:36,771
have to go to a dispensary but here's

3397
02:30:34,700 --> 02:30:38,690
another [ __ ] up issue the medical

3398
02:30:36,771 --> 02:30:40,730
marijuana dispensaries are running out

3399
02:30:38,690 --> 02:30:42,440
of medical cannabis while the

3400
02:30:40,729 --> 02:30:43,011
recreational dispensaries are well

3401
02:30:42,440 --> 02:30:48,081
stocked

3402
02:30:43,011 --> 02:30:49,970
I find that [ __ ] up but hugely so Mike

3403
02:30:48,081 --> 02:30:52,581
you're gonna have to go I'm out of weed

3404
02:30:49,970 --> 02:30:54,290
because they limited my numbers I can't

3405
02:30:52,581 --> 02:30:55,290
grow I don't have your outs for this

3406
02:30:54,290 --> 02:30:57,209
whatever time

3407
02:30:55,290 --> 02:30:58,350
we hypothetically but I'm not gonna go

3408
02:30:57,209 --> 02:30:59,909
to the weights in number but thank you

3409
02:30:58,350 --> 02:31:01,700
for not disclosing medical information

3410
02:30:59,909 --> 02:31:02,850
right your guests your monthly

3411
02:31:01,700 --> 02:31:04,529
subscription

3412
02:31:02,850 --> 02:31:06,059
sorry it's half short because of these

3413
02:31:04,529 --> 02:31:07,560
new regulations I haven't adjusted my

3414
02:31:06,059 --> 02:31:11,340
grow to that yet you're gonna have to go

3415
02:31:07,559 --> 02:31:12,689
to the dispensary did you lots of that

3416
02:31:11,340 --> 02:31:15,299
on my world are huge

3417
02:31:12,689 --> 02:31:18,479
yeah financially you're gonna cost

3418
02:31:15,299 --> 02:31:19,679
increases I don't want to say because

3419
02:31:18,478 --> 02:31:20,969
you could kind of look it up if you

3420
02:31:19,680 --> 02:31:23,100
really do your home [ __ ] what do your

3421
02:31:20,969 --> 02:31:24,750
homework people this will give you a an

3422
02:31:23,100 --> 02:31:28,710
example of how jealousy should be I

3423
02:31:24,750 --> 02:31:31,170
would pay at least twice as much if I

3424
02:31:28,709 --> 02:31:33,539
had to fill my prescription at a retail

3425
02:31:31,170 --> 02:31:35,579
at a medical we paid twice as much at a

3426
02:31:33,540 --> 02:31:38,810
medical medical shop because of the

3427
02:31:35,579 --> 02:31:40,770
taxes almost three times three times a

3428
02:31:38,809 --> 02:31:42,028
traditional shop and you're gonna and

3429
02:31:40,770 --> 02:31:44,579
what I'm getting at is the medical shops

3430
02:31:42,029 --> 02:31:46,560
are at a weed and that's where the the

3431
02:31:44,579 --> 02:31:48,209
medical the most of the stuff that's

3432
02:31:46,559 --> 02:31:49,590
there is tested they're a little ahead

3433
02:31:48,209 --> 02:31:52,139
of that everything's gonna have to be

3434
02:31:49,590 --> 02:31:56,340
tested you're real soon like no there's

3435
02:31:52,139 --> 02:31:57,869
there's for sure right provide you a

3436
02:31:56,340 --> 02:31:59,850
strain specific product that you have

3437
02:31:57,870 --> 02:32:01,710
gotten to look at you've gotten to trim

3438
02:31:59,850 --> 02:32:04,079
with me you've experienced that plant I

3439
02:32:01,709 --> 02:32:05,849
think part of you touching your medicine

3440
02:32:04,079 --> 02:32:07,350
like you guys have been involved with us

3441
02:32:05,850 --> 02:32:09,659
see it all the way through it makes it

3442
02:32:07,350 --> 02:32:12,090
better you are connected to that as you

3443
02:32:09,659 --> 02:32:13,680
consume it and as a I'm a Rastafarian

3444
02:32:12,090 --> 02:32:15,090
and I feel that that touch that

3445
02:32:13,680 --> 02:32:17,550
connection makes the medicine work

3446
02:32:15,090 --> 02:32:19,260
better for you involved with uncertain

3447
02:32:17,549 --> 02:32:21,148
that's one of the reasons that when I

3448
02:32:19,260 --> 02:32:23,579
make concentrates from your material

3449
02:32:21,148 --> 02:32:26,340
it's the most fun and I get the best

3450
02:32:23,579 --> 02:32:29,100
concentrates out of it it's and the

3451
02:32:26,340 --> 02:32:29,520
whole process is just really awesome to

3452
02:32:29,100 --> 02:32:32,040
me

3453
02:32:29,520 --> 02:32:33,779
not that it isn't always but with your

3454
02:32:32,040 --> 02:32:35,520
material there's like an extra level to

3455
02:32:33,779 --> 02:32:37,350
that for me and I think that's part of

3456
02:32:35,520 --> 02:32:40,350
it just being able to watch these plants

3457
02:32:37,350 --> 02:32:42,739
grow and being so close to you and the

3458
02:32:40,350 --> 02:32:45,689
plants and stuff it makes it like yeah

3459
02:32:42,739 --> 02:32:49,020
you guys ask me how is the lemon Jeffrey

3460
02:32:45,689 --> 02:32:51,510

3462
02:32:51,510 --> 02:32:55,430

sure come on over I'm seen I have

3467
02:33:05,020 --> 02:33:09,340
learned to eliminate a lot of the sprays

3468
02:33:06,969 --> 02:33:11,469
and talk things that I don't think I

3469
02:33:09,340 --> 02:33:12,818
would want to consume in my hash if I

3470
02:33:11,469 --> 02:33:14,199
wouldn't mist it into the air and let it

3471
02:33:12,818 --> 02:33:16,750
land on my hash I'm trying to get it out

3472
02:33:14,200 --> 02:33:20,620
of my grill room right and I am seeing

3473
02:33:16,750 --> 02:33:22,629
more and more companies more grows I am

3474
02:33:20,620 --> 02:33:24,760
privileged I get to go in to grow rooms

3475
02:33:22,629 --> 02:33:26,559
and I get to see things that [ __ ]

3476
02:33:24,760 --> 02:33:29,139
civilians would [ __ ] their pants over

3477
02:33:26,559 --> 02:33:31,238
dude right but I see four lights on so

3478
02:33:29,139 --> 02:33:33,789
many levels flora might in a court or a

3479
02:33:31,238 --> 02:33:38,109
paint container in professional grow

3480
02:33:33,790 --> 02:33:40,390
rooms and that dude though if uniform

3481
02:33:38,109 --> 02:33:43,059
light is terrible you're if you spray

3482
02:33:40,389 --> 02:33:44,709
flora might I guess any time is what I'm

3483
02:33:43,059 --> 02:33:47,199
learning even in veg now it's gonna

3484
02:33:44,709 --> 02:33:49,000
still remain in your flowers at harvest

3485
02:33:47,200 --> 02:33:50,529
after flush it'll be there and you're

3486
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:52,898
gonna be dabbing it most likely if

3487
02:33:50,529 --> 02:33:57,609
you're a future kid and you're dabbing

3488
02:33:52,898 --> 02:33:58,930
neurotoxins on a daily basis yummy stuff

3489
02:33:57,609 --> 02:34:01,000
we're talking about there's no I'm not

3490
02:33:58,930 --> 02:34:02,680
to animal without legalization these

3491
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:05,079
guys know I'm not flora my dabbing them

3492
02:34:02,680 --> 02:34:06,818
you know no I've been watching you

3493
02:34:05,079 --> 02:34:08,829
learning why not since pretty much the

3494
02:34:06,818 --> 02:34:09,909
beginning right Mike remember the time

3495
02:34:08,829 --> 02:34:12,219
that I saw

3496
02:34:09,909 --> 02:34:15,129
I [ __ ] up one time really badly it was

3497
02:34:12,219 --> 02:34:16,959
the middle of winter and my gear it was

3498
02:34:15,129 --> 02:34:18,849
it switched from the in Colorado we get

3499
02:34:16,959 --> 02:34:20,318
a heavy switch from fall or summer fall

3500
02:34:18,850 --> 02:34:22,120
winter it just goes boom it's about a

3501
02:34:20,318 --> 02:34:23,318
week right you'll be wearing shorts and

3502
02:34:22,120 --> 02:34:25,989
a t-shirt and then you're in [ __ ]

3503
02:34:23,318 --> 02:34:28,389
eskimo boots and a snow hat freezing a

3504
02:34:25,988 --> 02:34:30,818
dick off and at that time period I got

3505
02:34:28,389 --> 02:34:32,469
powdery mildew from not adjusting and

3506
02:34:30,818 --> 02:34:34,299
adapting to the rooms because I wasn't

3507
02:34:32,469 --> 02:34:36,639
experienced in Colorado to grow yet I

3508
02:34:34,299 --> 02:34:38,738
got a four to five ounce white rhino

3509
02:34:36,639 --> 02:34:40,269
plant that had powdery mildew up to one

3510
02:34:38,738 --> 02:34:42,670
side that was facing the wall because

3511
02:34:40,270 --> 02:34:44,770
the wall radiated cold and it made it

3512
02:34:42,670 --> 02:34:47,620
I'm sure that right I was an amateur

3513
02:34:44,770 --> 02:34:49,630
mistake but I heard an answer to like I

3514
02:34:47,620 --> 02:34:53,260
totally remember this night is it's one

3515
02:34:49,629 --> 02:34:55,028
of the reasons that I stopped really

3516
02:34:53,260 --> 02:34:57,279
shopping anywhere else because I knew

3517
02:34:55,029 --> 02:34:58,620
that whatever was coming from your

3518
02:34:57,279 --> 02:35:00,930
garden

3519
02:34:58,620 --> 02:35:03,329
had this step in it and I watched him

3520
02:35:00,930 --> 02:35:05,850
take a set of shears cut the plant out

3521
02:35:03,329 --> 02:35:07,530
of its pot and stuff stuff it right into

3522
02:35:05,850 --> 02:35:08,520
B black trash bag and haul it out of the

3523
02:35:07,530 --> 02:35:12,659
house immediately

3524
02:35:08,520 --> 02:35:15,750
yeah our five ounce plant we had we had

3525
02:35:12,659 --> 02:35:18,750
just trimmed two identical to it that

3526
02:35:15,750 --> 02:35:20,340
were perfectly healthy and that third

3527
02:35:18,750 --> 02:35:23,430
one right to the trash just no

3528
02:35:20,340 --> 02:35:25,170
questioning no thought to loss or any of

3529
02:35:23,430 --> 02:35:28,020
that and I have watched other growers

3530
02:35:25,170 --> 02:35:31,079
cut mold and things out of plants and

3531
02:35:28,020 --> 02:35:32,790
sell the rest yeah yeah I'm a medical

3532
02:35:31,079 --> 02:35:34,319
marijuana caregiver and I love the guys

3533
02:35:32,790 --> 02:35:35,729
that I'm helping out I really do I got a

3534
02:35:34,319 --> 02:35:37,799
big heart I like to thank for being such

3535
02:35:35,728 --> 02:35:39,569

3536
02:35:37,799 --> 02:35:41,519

3566
02:36:59,579 --> 02:37:03,479
parts of

3567
02:37:01,260 --> 02:37:06,390

powdery mildew in it or god only knows

3571
02:37:11,040 --> 02:37:15,960

a lot that's kind of weird I want to say

3593
02:38:06,931 --> 02:38:11,069
that well I mean this stuff they're

3594
02:38:09,329 --> 02:38:12,931
talking about in the legislature right

3595
02:38:11,069 --> 02:38:14,729
now screws with us on a personal level

3596
02:38:12,931 --> 02:38:17,610
yeah it really does yeah

3597
02:38:14,729 --> 02:38:21,149
think about the medications you take on

3598
02:38:17,610 --> 02:38:22,319
a daily basis or your diet I know we've

3599
02:38:21,149 --> 02:38:24,090
got a bunch of mountain dew sitting on

3600
02:38:22,319 --> 02:38:26,279
the table shoutouts I do not I want to

3601
02:38:24,090 --> 02:38:27,569
mention that I have really quit drinking

3602
02:38:26,280 --> 02:38:29,489
Mountain Dew and I'm effing proud of

3603
02:38:27,569 --> 02:38:31,140
myself I had a bad addiction I'm fairly

3604
02:38:29,489 --> 02:38:34,860
impressed as well is this serious

3605
02:38:31,140 --> 02:38:39,810
Mountain Dew addict but like think about

3606
02:38:34,860 --> 02:38:43,110
some idiot in Congress toying with your

3607
02:38:39,810 --> 02:38:45,000
drug regimen every day on a personal

3608
02:38:43,110 --> 02:38:47,670
medication level what if your xanax

3609
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:50,129
prescription was about to go from three

3610
02:38:47,670 --> 02:38:51,931
pills a day to one because somebody in

3611
02:38:50,129 --> 02:38:53,629
Congress just realized that doctors

3612
02:38:51,931 --> 02:38:55,860
weren't giving out the bare minimum

3613
02:38:53,629 --> 02:38:57,239
regardless of what the patient feedback

3614
02:38:55,860 --> 02:38:58,710
was I told you you can only take your

3615
02:38:57,239 --> 02:39:02,549
birth control pill on Wednesday Thursday

3616
02:38:58,709 --> 02:39:04,289
and Friday good luck right like how many

3617
02:39:02,549 --> 02:39:07,619
different medications I'm sorry your

3618
02:39:04,290 --> 02:39:09,420
prozac's just two a day now because you

3619
02:39:07,620 --> 02:39:10,740
know the legislature really doesn't

3620
02:39:09,420 --> 02:39:12,809
think you should be taking for a day

3621
02:39:10,739 --> 02:39:15,328
regardless of how much your body

3622
02:39:12,809 --> 02:39:16,289
or what your doctor is your doctor are

3623
02:39:15,328 --> 02:39:21,449
you crazy

3624
02:39:16,290 --> 02:39:24,779
yeah and I actually use marijuana for

3625
02:39:21,449 --> 02:39:27,899
medical purposes I was injured I have

3626
02:39:24,779 --> 02:39:31,078
nerve generated pain you can google this

3627
02:39:27,898 --> 02:39:34,049
we don't have a pill that works great on

3628
02:39:31,078 --> 02:39:36,898
nerve generated pain no I can swallow a

3629
02:39:34,049 --> 02:39:40,408
vicodin and I did for a number of weeks

3630
02:39:36,898 --> 02:39:42,118
after I got hurt in my arm still felt

3631
02:39:40,408 --> 02:39:43,559
like it was stuck in a car door I'm

3632
02:39:42,119 --> 02:39:44,939
gonna do it Jack the Ripper dab with one

3633
02:39:43,559 --> 02:39:46,260
of these sweet stone candies in my mouth

3634
02:39:44,939 --> 02:39:50,040
and I can imagine it's gonna be [ __ ]

3635
02:39:46,260 --> 02:39:52,648
delicious keep talking for a minute what

3636
02:39:50,040 --> 02:39:56,119
do you guys along with a whole bunch of

3637
02:39:52,648 --> 02:39:59,189
people in Colorado tried marijuana as a

3638
02:39:56,119 --> 02:40:00,750
medicine for a medical effect I just

3639
02:39:59,189 --> 02:40:02,068
pictured a bunch of you and a bunch of

3640
02:40:00,750 --> 02:40:03,809
people sitting down like at the face of

3641
02:40:02,068 --> 02:40:05,309
buttermilk Mountain just lined up we all

3642
02:40:03,809 --> 02:40:07,049
got together and we're like alright

3643
02:40:05,309 --> 02:40:08,908
everybody don't take your pain

3644
02:40:07,049 --> 02:40:09,478
medication today we're all gonna go do

3645
02:40:08,908 --> 02:40:12,930
dabs

3646
02:40:09,478 --> 02:40:14,728
then try that for a day but that's

3647
02:40:12,930 --> 02:40:16,850
essentially what we did we stopped I

3648
02:40:14,728 --> 02:40:18,809
stopped taking pills for a day and just

3649
02:40:16,850 --> 02:40:21,930
smoked a little bit of pot in the

3650
02:40:18,809 --> 02:40:23,908
morning and went about my day off smoked

3651
02:40:21,930 --> 02:40:25,648
a lot of pot in the afternoon and as the

3652
02:40:23,908 --> 02:40:27,478
day went on and I started to hurt more

3653
02:40:25,648 --> 02:40:29,459
I'd smoked a little more and the pain

3654
02:40:27,478 --> 02:40:31,590
would fade right away right now I'm pain

3655
02:40:29,459 --> 02:40:34,019
free and I was hurting when I got here a

3656
02:40:31,590 --> 02:40:35,728
few hours ago I'll be a little sore

3657
02:40:34,020 --> 02:40:40,578
again when I leave so that I can drive

3658
02:40:35,728 --> 02:40:40,578
safely home back to the blood test

3659
02:40:41,510 --> 02:40:46,228
slightly afraid of needles but I've got

3660
02:40:43,738 --> 02:40:47,488
tattoos and I've donated plasma so I

3661
02:40:46,228 --> 02:40:50,309
think I can handle and make them write

3662
02:40:47,488 --> 02:40:52,228
you a note for the track marks right so

3663
02:40:50,309 --> 02:40:54,028
one thing I want to mention before we

3664
02:40:52,228 --> 02:40:55,108
caught ranting about me and growing and

3665
02:40:54,029 --> 02:40:57,899
I want to get on to the next subject

3666
02:40:55,109 --> 02:40:59,578
here I think a lot of the places that

3667
02:40:57,898 --> 02:41:00,809
people get problems from their plants

3668
02:40:59,578 --> 02:41:03,959
their bugs

3669
02:41:00,809 --> 02:41:05,340
often come from clones you're bringing

3670
02:41:03,959 --> 02:41:08,099
in bugs when you bring in clones from

3671
02:41:05,340 --> 02:41:09,750
other people I know it's awesome to

3672
02:41:08,100 --> 02:41:13,229
trade clones but be careful dude be

3673
02:41:09,750 --> 02:41:15,510
careful inspect that [ __ ] the best that

3674
02:41:13,228 --> 02:41:17,278
you can and have some sort of organic

3675
02:41:15,510 --> 02:41:19,920
regimen to get rid of those spider mites

3676
02:41:17,279 --> 02:41:21,569
quarantine that plant spider much of the

3677
02:41:19,920 --> 02:41:23,398
most common and also one of the most

3678
02:41:21,568 --> 02:41:26,408
[ __ ] pesky it

3679
02:41:23,398 --> 02:41:29,829
that's why seed is so awesome and why

3680
02:41:26,408 --> 02:41:33,100
plant count limits of three and six and

3681
02:41:29,829 --> 02:41:36,039
thirty are so restrictive is because you

3682
02:41:33,100 --> 02:41:38,920
got to order ten seeds so I got up all

3683
02:41:36,040 --> 02:41:41,020
ten of them and there's a third of what

3684
02:41:38,920 --> 02:41:42,279
you're allowed to have yeah and then you

3685
02:41:41,020 --> 02:41:43,869
got to find the few cupcake clones of

3686
02:41:42,279 --> 02:41:47,290
them right from those ten seeds you

3687
02:41:43,869 --> 02:41:49,659
might get one or two that you keep but

3688
02:41:47,290 --> 02:41:52,199
until you figure that out you've got ten

3689
02:41:49,658 --> 02:41:54,368
and you've got to check off your count

3690
02:41:52,199 --> 02:41:56,229
sorry I did not just stick on this one

3691
02:41:54,369 --> 02:41:58,689
topic but it's one I've been watching

3692
02:41:56,228 --> 02:42:04,179
all week and it just it strikes a nerve

3693
02:41:58,689 --> 02:42:05,619
we can tell we can tell it's good excuse

3694
02:42:04,180 --> 02:42:07,148
my cough I'm looking for an article I've

3695
02:42:05,619 --> 02:42:09,100
got saved here what are you reaching for

02:42:11,260 --> 02:42:21,010
perfect slowly rotating sound bounces

3699
02:42:18,939 --> 02:42:23,648
from right to left in my headphones and

3700
02:42:21,010 --> 02:42:26,648
it's disorienting like it's hard to

3701
02:42:23,648 --> 02:42:28,118
explain exactly how this has been our

3702
02:42:26,648 --> 02:42:31,420

3714
02:42:55,840 --> 02:42:59,408
Herer

3715
02:42:56,199 --> 02:43:01,479
I think it's hammer hill it's Harry

3716
02:42:59,408 --> 02:43:03,459
I better not say Herrera we gotta say

3717
02:43:01,478 --> 02:43:05,260
herro everybody pronounces it

3718
02:43:03,459 --> 02:43:07,118
differently I don't even attempt it uh

3719
02:43:05,260 --> 02:43:08,770
well I know that I used to think that it

3720
02:43:07,119 --> 02:43:10,930
was like short for Herrera like it was

3721
02:43:08,770 --> 02:43:12,880
from the same shoe cuz where we're from

3722
02:43:10,930 --> 02:43:15,340
that's a popular name it's not that

3723
02:43:12,879 --> 02:43:16,658
so it's Herer and not Herer so we're

3724
02:43:15,340 --> 02:43:19,148
gonna try and say it right I got to

3725
02:43:16,658 --> 02:43:21,430
retrain my brain I apologize first take

3726
02:43:19,148 --> 02:43:22,358
a DAB that's my excuse so Jack Herrera I

3727
02:43:21,430 --> 02:43:24,068
want to give you thanks

3728
02:43:22,359 --> 02:43:25,359
you're crucial to the cannabis movement

3729
02:43:24,068 --> 02:43:27,189
I'm gonna read a little bit about him

3730
02:43:25,359 --> 02:43:30,510
this is mostly from Wikipedia

3731
02:43:27,189 --> 02:43:32,949
Jack Herer is born in June 18th of 1939

3732
02:43:30,510 --> 02:43:35,648
sometimes called the emperor of hemp

3733
02:43:32,949 --> 02:43:37,090
Jack Herer was an American cannabis

3734
02:43:35,648 --> 02:43:39,398
activists and the author of the Emperor

3735
02:43:37,090 --> 02:43:41,189
wears no clothes a book still worth

3736
02:43:39,398 --> 02:43:45,459
buying and reading ladies and gentlemen

3737
02:43:41,189 --> 02:43:46,540
when it works nice in this book why is

3738
02:43:45,459 --> 02:43:48,029
it worth buying to read you guys want to

3739
02:43:46,540 --> 02:43:49,770
elaborate on that for me for a minute

3740
02:43:48,030 --> 02:43:53,229
[Music]

3741
02:43:49,770 --> 02:43:56,050
it's a fantastic history of hemp in the

3742
02:43:53,228 --> 02:43:56,379
US and across the world and you should

3743
02:43:56,049 --> 02:43:59,738
read it

3744
02:43:56,379 --> 02:44:02,589
short version and it's used to back up

3745
02:43:59,738 --> 02:44:05,079
like the legalize cannabis talks it's

3746
02:44:02,590 --> 02:44:07,270
got a lot of yeah reasons like useful

3747
02:44:05,079 --> 02:44:09,430
stuff it's kind of things in the front

3748
02:44:07,270 --> 02:44:11,020
that's I don't remember that it's been

3749
02:44:09,430 --> 02:44:12,729
15 years since I've read this book now I

3750
02:44:11,020 --> 02:44:14,619
feel bad for not being prepared but it's

3751
02:44:12,728 --> 02:44:16,209
essentially a challenge for an insane

3752
02:44:14,619 --> 02:44:18,520
amount of money that if you can disprove

3753
02:44:16,209 --> 02:44:20,198
anything in this book I will give you a

3754
02:44:18,520 --> 02:44:22,238
huge amount of money and no one ever

3755
02:44:20,199 --> 02:44:24,420
attempted to claim it nice because you

3756
02:44:22,238 --> 02:44:27,969
can't disprove anything he says and it's

3757
02:44:24,420 --> 02:44:30,879
really the Pioneer book about cannabis

3758
02:44:27,969 --> 02:44:33,519
and all of the medical and industrial

3759
02:44:30,879 --> 02:44:35,908
uses in a time when knowing a bunch

3760
02:44:33,520 --> 02:44:40,449
about marijuana was a criminal offense

3761
02:44:35,908 --> 02:44:44,738
essentially sounds good I like your you

3762
02:44:40,449 --> 02:44:45,908
know some [ __ ] bro really Jaime I saw

3763
02:44:44,738 --> 02:44:52,809
your eyes roll back in your head and you

3764
02:44:45,908 --> 02:44:54,219
started going to books you bro of course

3765
02:44:52,809 --> 02:44:55,840
the emperor wears nose closed which

3766
02:44:54,219 --> 02:44:56,559
we've been ranting about and also a book

3767
02:44:55,840 --> 02:44:57,969
called grass

3768
02:44:56,559 --> 02:45:01,840
there's also documentary about him

3769
02:44:57,969 --> 02:45:05,709
called the emperor of hemp Jack believed

3770
02:45:01,840 --> 02:45:07,029
Jack Herer believed that can the

3771
02:45:05,709 --> 02:45:08,500
cannabis plant should be criminalized

3772
02:45:07,029 --> 02:45:09,850
because sorry I got the sweets no no my

3773
02:45:08,500 --> 02:45:12,189
mouth had to move it out of the way see

3774
02:45:09,850 --> 02:45:13,600
the cat is plan D there's like five or

3775
02:45:12,189 --> 02:45:16,029
six little ones in this package and I'm

3776
02:45:13,600 --> 02:45:19,059
just savoring every [ __ ] lick of that

3777
02:45:16,029 --> 02:45:21,100
thing he felt the cannabis can't plant

3778
02:45:19,059 --> 02:45:22,840
should be decriminalized because it has

3779
02:45:21,100 --> 02:45:24,760
been shown to be a renewable source of

3780
02:45:22,840 --> 02:45:26,710
fuel food and medicine that can be grown

3781
02:45:24,760 --> 02:45:28,389
in ritual any part of the world

3782
02:45:26,709 --> 02:45:30,419
he further asserts that the US

3783
02:45:28,389 --> 02:45:32,439
government deliberately hides his proof

3784
02:45:30,420 --> 02:45:35,139
there is a strain of Jack Herer

3785
02:45:32,439 --> 02:45:38,079
Wikipedia mentions that error I did it

3786
02:45:35,139 --> 02:45:39,789
again but I should mention that that

3787
02:45:38,079 --> 02:45:41,549
strain was absolutely not his favorite

3788
02:45:39,790 --> 02:45:43,500
he wasn't even very fond of it

3789
02:45:41,549 --> 02:45:45,659
kind of ironic in my opinion like most

3790
02:45:43,500 --> 02:45:48,148
strains named after people the people

3791
02:45:45,659 --> 02:45:50,189
they're named after never interact with

3792
02:45:48,148 --> 02:45:52,289
the person attempting to honor them in

3793
02:45:50,189 --> 02:45:54,180
any way so you get that a lot loud seeds

3794
02:45:52,290 --> 02:45:55,620
and ganja farmer OG big up give them a

3795
02:45:54,180 --> 02:45:56,880
shout-out they actually collaborated

3796
02:45:55,620 --> 02:45:58,410
they got the gun your farmer oh gee

3797
02:45:56,879 --> 02:46:00,449
that's kind of waiting for that

3798
02:45:58,409 --> 02:46:02,609
precedence I'm impressed

3799
02:46:00,450 --> 02:46:04,890
does not surprise me that you know the

3800
02:46:02,609 --> 02:46:07,170
the example that breaks the rules yeah

3801
02:46:04,889 --> 02:46:08,969
well that's - that loud is a great

3802
02:46:07,170 --> 02:46:10,318
reading company and they were all over

3803
02:46:08,969 --> 02:46:12,090
the Cannabis Cup last year everywhere

3804
02:46:10,318 --> 02:46:13,739
you looked as loud loud loud yeah and

3805
02:46:12,090 --> 02:46:15,329
Marlon Asher is a reggae artist that

3806
02:46:13,739 --> 02:46:17,189
sings janja farmer so of course I'm

3807
02:46:15,329 --> 02:46:19,530
gonna know that nice of course did you

3808
02:46:17,189 --> 02:46:22,770
guys know that her ran for the United

3809
02:46:19,530 --> 02:46:24,630
States president twice in 1998 and 1992

3810
02:46:22,770 --> 02:46:26,220
as a grassroots party candidate I did

3811
02:46:24,629 --> 02:46:28,199
not know that I could not have told you

3812
02:46:26,219 --> 02:46:29,369
the years but I knew that that was one

3813
02:46:28,200 --> 02:46:31,500
of the stunts that he pulled

3814
02:46:29,370 --> 02:46:32,939
unfortunately in July of 2000 he

3815
02:46:31,500 --> 02:46:35,790
suffered a minor heart attack and a

3816
02:46:32,939 --> 02:46:37,409
major stroke resulting in difficulty

3817
02:46:35,790 --> 02:46:39,870
speaking and moving the right side of

3818
02:46:37,409 --> 02:46:42,299
his body he mostly recovered but on

3819
02:46:39,870 --> 02:46:43,620
September 12th 2009 he suffered another

3820
02:46:42,299 --> 02:46:45,269
heart attack while backstage at the heme

3821
02:46:43,620 --> 02:46:47,550
stock Festival in Portland Oregon I

3822
02:46:45,270 --> 02:46:50,159
spent a month in critical condition in a

3823
02:46:47,549 --> 02:46:51,629
Portland Hospital in a medically induced

3824
02:46:50,159 --> 02:46:57,000
coma he was discharged to another

3825
02:46:51,629 --> 02:46:58,379
facility Paul Stanford of the hemp and

3826
02:46:57,000 --> 02:47:00,809
cannabis Foundation said that he's

3827
02:46:58,379 --> 02:47:02,369
waking up in gazing appropriately when

3828
02:47:00,809 --> 02:47:03,930
someone is talking but he's not really

3829
02:47:02,370 --> 02:47:06,390
communicating in any way and

3830

respect but I want to mention one funny

3847
02:47:51,430 --> 02:47:55,299
thing there's a guy named Jeff McElroy

3848
02:47:53,318 --> 02:48:01,538
he is running for the mayor of Toronto

3849
02:47:55,299 --> 02:48:04,119
Canada not an endorsement that's just

3850
02:48:01,539 --> 02:48:06,759
how this story starts his campaign sign

3851
02:48:04,119 --> 02:48:09,220
he's got these big there's six feet wide

3852
02:48:06,759 --> 02:48:11,020
and I think there's six feet tall but

3853
02:48:09,219 --> 02:48:13,418
they're like a plywood sheet so it's

3854
02:48:11,020 --> 02:48:15,488
only like it's got posts so it's only

3855
02:48:13,418 --> 02:48:18,338
half of the way it fit it is wide it's a

3856
02:48:15,488 --> 02:48:20,529
pretty burly campaign son yeah he's not

3857
02:48:18,338 --> 02:48:25,478
the little plastic one on the wires no

3858
02:48:20,529 --> 02:48:28,060
no it's this sign the sign reads Jeff

3859
02:48:25,478 --> 02:48:29,798
McIlroy he promises to just smoke pot as

3860
02:48:28,059 --> 02:48:32,168
mayor not crack any one's better than

3861
02:48:29,799 --> 02:48:34,899
Rob Ford right if you get that you get

3862
02:48:32,168 --> 02:48:37,418
that that's [ __ ] funny I love that

3863
02:48:34,898 --> 02:48:39,698
Rob Ford's approval ratings have gone up

3864
02:48:37,418 --> 02:48:43,779
or remained steady since the scandal

3865
02:48:39,699 --> 02:48:46,239
broke it turns out in Canada no one

3866
02:48:43,779 --> 02:48:48,399
really cares what you smoke as long as

3867
02:48:46,238 --> 02:48:50,889
you don't screw with them too much from

3868
02:48:48,398 --> 02:48:52,448
a government standpoint one more one

3869
02:48:50,889 --> 02:48:53,828
more piece of information that I feel

3870
02:48:52,449 --> 02:48:55,720
like we should share with the world

3871
02:48:53,828 --> 02:48:57,189
we're coming to you from Colorado we

3872
02:48:55,719 --> 02:48:59,528
talked about that a lot I love Colorado

3873
02:48:57,189 --> 02:49:01,988
got medical land right now here's what I

3874
02:48:59,529 --> 02:49:06,299
want to hear ever well we got to go some

3875
02:49:01,988 --> 02:49:08,889
places sometimes you can't make me

3876
02:49:06,299 --> 02:49:11,229
pretty pretty serious so I had this

3877
02:49:08,889 --> 02:49:13,088
conversation yesterday with the wife and

3878
02:49:11,228 --> 02:49:16,599
I really don't want to leave without

3879
02:49:13,088 --> 02:49:17,798
some serious serious tempting I think

3880
02:49:16,600 --> 02:49:19,988
it's got to be a pretty happy order

3881
02:49:17,799 --> 02:49:21,939
anyway go on with what you're saying if

3882
02:49:19,988 --> 02:49:23,918
you're dried this man several people

3883
02:49:21,939 --> 02:49:26,229
apparently have reported that they were

3884
02:49:23,918 --> 02:49:27,609
in Idaho driving with Colorado license

3885
02:49:26,228 --> 02:49:31,238
plates and they are harassed by the

3886
02:49:27,609 --> 02:49:33,309
police pulled over and the cops harassed

3887
02:49:31,238 --> 02:49:36,038
them about marijuana like they're

3888
02:49:33,309 --> 02:49:38,288
driving cool but they and this is

3889
02:49:36,039 --> 02:49:39,489
allegedly I am NOT in anybody's shoes

3890
02:49:38,289 --> 02:49:41,020
here I'm reading a story from the

3891
02:49:39,488 --> 02:49:42,578
cannabis tis actually where I found this

3892
02:49:41,020 --> 02:49:43,810
because if you want cannabis news and

3893
02:49:42,578 --> 02:49:45,430
you don't feel like hearing me rattle it

3894
02:49:43,809 --> 02:49:47,019
off and stutter it the cannabis has a

3895
02:49:45,430 --> 02:49:48,850
lot of great stuff

3896
02:49:47,020 --> 02:49:50,918
my friend Kevin that works with pink

3897
02:49:48,850 --> 02:49:52,418
house also sends me a lot of great info

3898
02:49:50,918 --> 02:49:54,248
and I scour the web for this stuff to

3899
02:49:52,418 --> 02:49:56,949
find it if you've got something you want

3900
02:49:54,248 --> 02:49:58,389
to hear feel free to tweet it to me at I

3901
02:49:56,949 --> 02:50:00,459
grow culture and I'll talk about it I

3902
02:49:58,389 --> 02:50:01,539
love to do that would love to do it so

3903
02:50:00,459 --> 02:50:02,800
what's going on

3904
02:50:01,540 --> 02:50:03,850
and idaho these cops are pulling you

3905
02:50:02,799 --> 02:50:06,189
over and [ __ ] with you cuz you got

3906
02:50:03,850 --> 02:50:08,470
Colorado plates one guy they detained

3907
02:50:06,190 --> 02:50:10,030
him and they took his car to the police

3908
02:50:08,469 --> 02:50:12,309
station and had six cops search his car

3909
02:50:10,030 --> 02:50:14,260
for six hours and they didn't find

3910
02:50:12,309 --> 02:50:15,879
anything but the cop treated him like a

3911
02:50:14,260 --> 02:50:17,680
prick the entire time it was real

3912
02:50:15,879 --> 02:50:19,449
accusatory that the man was carrying

3913
02:50:17,680 --> 02:50:21,100
cannabis turns out the guy wasn't

3914
02:50:19,450 --> 02:50:23,470
affluent businessman and has a little

3915
02:50:21,100 --> 02:50:25,479
bit of money so now he's sparking up a

3916
02:50:23,469 --> 02:50:27,909
lawsuit against the police force that

3917
02:50:25,479 --> 02:50:28,629
harassed him so I can't wait to see how

3918
02:50:27,909 --> 02:50:31,510
that turns out

3919
02:50:28,629 --> 02:50:33,699
the this story is making the rounds this

3920
02:50:31,510 --> 02:50:36,760
week but it's it's really just the

3921
02:50:33,700 --> 02:50:39,610
latest example of this happening in all

3922
02:50:36,760 --> 02:50:41,380
the states around Colorado it's been

3923
02:50:39,610 --> 02:50:44,850
getting worse since we first passed our

3924
02:50:41,379 --> 02:50:48,039
medical marijuana laws back in 1999 or

3925
02:50:44,850 --> 02:50:50,950
at least after the dispensary explosion

3926
02:50:48,040 --> 02:50:53,110
in 2008 is when it got real bad is

3927
02:50:50,950 --> 02:50:54,460
Colorado license plate so like a big

3928
02:50:53,110 --> 02:50:56,771
target on your back if you're out of

3929
02:50:54,459 --> 02:50:59,469
state you're gonna get pulled over at

3930
02:50:56,771 --> 02:51:01,659
some point or people have been alleging

3931
02:50:59,469 --> 02:51:03,399
this for years there's a video of it

3932
02:51:01,659 --> 02:51:05,260
that you can poll of people trying to

3933
02:51:03,399 --> 02:51:08,409
record these encounters there's a number

3934
02:51:05,260 --> 02:51:09,760
of testimonies I suppose you'd call them

3935
02:51:08,409 --> 02:51:11,739
that have been put up on the web of

3936
02:51:09,760 --> 02:51:15,100
people being pulled over and harassed

3937
02:51:11,739 --> 02:51:18,010
for hours searched extensively for

3938
02:51:15,100 --> 02:51:20,440
marijuana beer or other drugs because

3939
02:51:18,010 --> 02:51:21,729
they've got Colorado plates mentioned

3940
02:51:20,440 --> 02:51:25,060
what happened in Texas and this will be

3941
02:51:21,729 --> 02:51:27,939
our little cinema in other states along

3942
02:51:25,059 --> 02:51:30,279
the southern border especially there's

3943
02:51:27,940 --> 02:51:33,280
been a number of cases in the last six

3944
02:51:30,280 --> 02:51:35,050
months or a year so of troopers pulling

3945
02:51:33,280 --> 02:51:37,000
over people not necessarily with

3946
02:51:35,049 --> 02:51:39,579
Colorado plates plates from anywhere and

3947
02:51:37,000 --> 02:51:41,530
saying I think you have drugs and when

3948
02:51:39,579 --> 02:51:44,649
the person says I'm sorry officer I

3949
02:51:41,530 --> 02:51:47,170
don't have any drugs or contraband the

3950
02:51:44,649 --> 02:51:49,799
cop essentially keeps insisting you have

3951
02:51:47,170 --> 02:51:53,170
drugs and then in a number of examples

3952
02:51:49,799 --> 02:51:56,170
an example recorded on a dashcam

3953
02:51:53,170 --> 02:51:58,780
an officer performs vaginal and anal

3954
02:51:56,170 --> 02:52:01,930
cavity searches on an aunt and a niece

3955
02:51:58,780 --> 02:52:04,750
at the same time on the side of the road

3956
02:52:01,930 --> 02:52:07,149
without changing their glove I mean just

3957
02:52:04,750 --> 02:52:09,399
take a minute and throw up and I

3958
02:52:07,149 --> 02:52:11,350
apologize I make this nice and clear but

3959
02:52:09,399 --> 02:52:12,398
this is the size of a public highway in

3960
02:52:11,350 --> 02:52:15,039
Texas

3961
02:52:12,398 --> 02:52:16,090
a cop car your car these ladies car you

3962
02:52:15,039 --> 02:52:18,998
know side of the highway lights of

3963
02:52:16,090 --> 02:52:21,100
flashing yep aunt and niece on the side

3964
02:52:18,998 --> 02:52:22,689
of the highway yep like it's 40 year old

3965
02:52:21,100 --> 02:52:25,328
and a 20 year old female probably

3966
02:52:22,689 --> 02:52:26,889
handcuffed feeling humiliated scared yep

3967
02:52:25,328 --> 02:52:28,629
terrifies I don't think they were

3968
02:52:26,889 --> 02:52:30,278
handcuffed but they definitely were

3969
02:52:28,629 --> 02:52:32,108
humiliated and terrified

3970
02:52:30,279 --> 02:52:33,880
so this officer I don't know if there's

3971
02:52:32,109 --> 02:52:34,809
a trooper or a State Patrol or what they

3972
02:52:33,879 --> 02:52:36,998

forcible rape on to victims and some

3995
02:53:21,639 --> 02:53:24,939
sort of the fact that it happened on the

3996
02:53:23,168 --> 02:53:26,379
highway just because the cop felt like

3997
02:53:24,939 --> 02:53:29,168

02:53:36,279 --> 02:53:41,140
on the side of the highway with the same

4003

this and this isn't an isolated example

4007
02:53:49,898 --> 02:53:53,469
when when the stories break a number of

4008
02:53:52,299 --> 02:53:55,328
people come forward and say that

4009

4018
02:54:21,998 --> 02:54:26,239
every other product

4019
02:54:22,940 --> 02:54:30,021
on the market and we enjoy safety in

4020
02:54:26,239 --> 02:54:33,470
oversight that you don't get in the

4021
02:54:30,021 --> 02:54:35,900
majority the other 49 states and we also

4022
02:54:33,470 --> 02:54:39,500
enjoy freedom from persecution because

4023
02:54:35,899 --> 02:54:41,479

the new caregiver law to pass I want you

4027
02:54:47,390 --> 02:54:50,810

4031

the caregiver account and let us do what

4040
02:55:13,671 --> 02:55:17,681
we're doing because we're not [ __ ]

4041

around we're trying to help sick people

4042
02:55:17,681 --> 02:55:22,159
every rep in Colorado has a web page

4043
02:55:20,239 --> 02:55:24,829
with a button on it to make it easy to

4044
02:55:22,159 --> 02:55:29,869
email them please do so do it that's

4045
02:55:24,829 --> 02:55:30,890
it's our responsibility to have to fight

4046
02:55:29,870 --> 02:55:33,040
for what we want it's our responsibility

4047
02:55:30,890 --> 02:55:35,779
to stand up and speak if nobody if

4048
02:55:33,040 --> 02:55:37,131
nobody speaks up nobody speaks up and if

4049
02:55:35,780 --> 02:55:38,239
when one of us speaks up and you see

4050
02:55:37,130 --> 02:55:40,220
your buddy speaking up it's that much

4051
02:55:38,239 --> 02:55:42,289
